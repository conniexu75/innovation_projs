https://openalex.org/W2068010171,"Protein modification by the conjugation of ubiquitin moieties--ubiquitination--plays a major part in many biological processes, including cell cycle and apoptosis. The enzymes that mediate ubiquitin-conjugation have been well-studied, but much less is known about the ubiquitin-specific proteases that mediate de-ubiquitination of cellular substrates. To study this gene family, we designed a collection of RNA interference vectors to suppress 50 human de-ubiquitinating enzymes, and used these vectors to identify de-ubiquitinating enzymes in cancer-relevant pathways. We report here that inhibition of one of these enzymes, the familial cylindromatosis tumour suppressor gene (CYLD), having no known function, enhances activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. We show that CYLD binds to the NEMO (also known as IKKgamma) component of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, and appears to regulate its activity through de-ubiquitination of TRAF2, as TRAF2 ubiquitination can be modulated by CYLD. Inhibition of CYLD increases resistance to apoptosis, suggesting a mechanism through which loss of CYLD contributes to oncogenesis. We show that this effect can be relieved by aspirin derivatives that inhibit NF-kappaB activity, which suggests a therapeutic intervention strategy to restore growth control in patients suffering from familial cylindromatosis."
https://openalex.org/W2146204355,"Familial cylindromatosis is an autosomal dominant predisposition to tumours of skin appendages called cylindromas. Familial cylindromatosis is caused by mutations in a gene encoding the CYLD protein of previously unknown function. Here we show that CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB by specific tumour-necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Loss of the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD correlates with tumorigenesis. CYLD inhibits activation of NF-kappaB by the TNFR family members CD40, XEDAR and EDAR in a manner that depends on the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD. Downregulation of CYLD by RNA-mediated interference augments both basal and CD40-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. The inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by CYLD is mediated, at least in part, by the deubiquitination and inactivation of TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and, to a lesser extent, TRAF6. These results indicate that CYLD is a negative regulator of the cytokine-mediated activation of NF-kappaB that is required for appropriate cellular homeostasis of skin appendages."

Here we have sequenced and analysed the 2.4-megabase genome of Synechococcus sp. strain WH8102, revealing some of the ways that these organisms have adapted to their largely oligotrophic environment. WH8102 uses organic nitrogen and phosphorus sources and more sodium-dependent transporters than a model freshwater cyanobacterium. Furthermore, it seems to have adopted strategies for conserving limited iron stores by using nickel and cobalt in some enzymes, has reduced its regulatory machinery (consistent with the fact that the open ocean constitutes a far more constant and buffered environment than fresh water), and has evolved a unique type of swimming motility. The genome of WH8102 seems to have been greatly influenced by horizontal gene transfer, partially through phages. The genetic material contributed by horizontal gene transfer includes genes involved in the modification of the cell surface and in swimming motility. On the basis of its genome, WH8102 is more of a generalist than two related marine cyanobacteria."

https://openalex.org/W1976706864,"More than 50% of the Earth' s surface is sea floor below 3,000 m of water. Most of this major reservoir in the global carbon cycle and final repository for anthropogenic wastes is characterized by severe food limitation. Phytodetritus is the major food source for abyssal benthic communities, and a large fraction of the annual food load can arrive in pulses within a few days. Owing to logistical constraints, the available data concerning the fate of such a pulse are scattered and often contradictory, hampering global carbon modelling and anthropogenic impact assessments. We quantified (over a period of 2.5 to 23 days) the response of an abyssal benthic community to a phytodetritus pulse, on the basis of 11 in situ experiments. Here we report that, in contrast to previous hypotheses, the sediment community oxygen consumption doubled immediately, and that macrofauna were very important for initial carbon degradation. The retarded response of bacteria and Foraminifera, the restriction of microbial carbon degradation to the sediment surface, and the low total carbon turnover distinguish abyssal from continental-slope 'deep-sea' sediments."

https://openalex.org/W1993791286,"Amyloid diseases are characterized by an aberrant assembly of a specific protein or protein fragment into fibrils and plaques that are deposited in various organs and tissues, often with serious pathological consequences. Non-neuropathic systemic amyloidosis is associated with single point mutations in the gene coding for human lysozyme. Here we report that a single-domain fragment of a camelid antibody raised against wild-type human lysozyme inhibits the in vitro aggregation of its amyloidogenic variant, D67H. Our structural studies reveal that the epitope includes neither the site of mutation nor most residues in the region of the protein structure that is destabilized by the mutation. Instead, the binding of the antibody fragment achieves its effect by restoring the structural cooperativity characteristic of the wild-type protein. This appears to occur at least in part through the transmission of long-range conformational effects to the interface between the two structural domains of the protein. Thus, reducing the ability of an amyloidogenic protein to form partly unfolded species can be an effective method of preventing its aggregation, suggesting approaches to the rational design of therapeutic agents directed against protein deposition diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1989054568,"The telomerase complex is responsible for telomere maintenance and represents a promising neoplasia therapeutic target. In order to determine whether G-quadruplex-interactive telomerase inhibitor, telomestatin (SOT-095), might have effects on telomere dynamics and to evaluate the clinical utility, we assessed the effects of telomestatin on BCR-ABL-positive human leukemia cells. We found that treatment with telomestatin reproducibly inhibited telomerase activity in the BCR-ABL-positive leukemic cell lines OM9;22 and K562, resulting in telomere shortening. Inhibition of telomerase activity by telomestatin disrupts telomere maintenance and ultimately results in telomere dysfunction. Telomestatin completely suppressed the plating efficiency of K562 cells at 1 μ M; however, telomestatin had less effects on BFU-Es and CFU-GMs colony formation from normal bone marrow CD34-positive cells. Enhanced chemosensitivity toward imatinib and chemotherapeutic agents was also observed in telomestatin-treated K562 cells. Further, the combination of telomestatin plus imatinib more effectively inhibited hematopoietic colony formation by primary human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Last, telomestatin induced the activation of ATM and Chk2, and subsequently increased the expression of p21CIP1 and p27KIP1. These results demonstrate that telomere dysfunction induced by telomestatin activates the ATM-dependent DNA damage response. We conclude that telomerase inhibitors combined with the use of imatinib and other chemotherapeutic agents may be very useful for the treatment of human leukemia."

https://openalex.org/W2139286816,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates extracellular calcium homeostasis through the type 1 PTH receptor (PTH1R) expressed in kidney and bone. The PTH1R undergoes β-arrestin/dynamin-mediated endocytosis in response to the biologically active forms of PTH, PTH-(1–34), and PTH-(1–84). We now show that amino-truncated forms of PTH that do not activate the PTH1R nonetheless induce PTH1R internalization in a cell-specific pattern. Activation-independent PTH1R endocytosis proceeds through a distinct arrestin-independent mechanism that is operative in cells lacking the adaptor protein Na/H exchange regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) (ezrin-binding protein 50). Using a combination of radioligand binding experiments and quantitative, live cell confocal microscopy of fluorescently tagged PTH1Rs, we show that in kidney distal tubule cells and rat osteosarcoma cells, which lack NHERF1, the synthetic antagonist PTH-(7–34) and naturally circulating PTH-(7–84) induce internalization of PTH1R in a β-arrestin-independent but dynamin-dependent manner. Expression of NHERF1 in these cells inhibited antagonist-induced endocytosis. Conversely, expression of dominant-negative forms of NHERF1 conferred internalization sensitivity to PTH-(7–34) in cells expressing NHERF1. Mutation of the PTH1R PDZ-binding motif abrogated interaction of the receptor with NHERF1. These mutated receptors were fully functional but were now internalized in response to PTH-(7–34) even in NHERF1-expressing cells. Removing the NHERF1 ERM domain or inhibiting actin polymerization allowed otherwise inactive ligands to internalize the PTH1R. These results demonstrate that NHERF1 acts as a molecular switch that legislates the conditional efficacy of PTH fragments. Distinct endocytic pathways are determined by NHERF1 that are operative for the PTH1R in kidney and bone cells.

Distinct endocytic pathways are determined by NHERF1 that are operative for the PTH1R in kidney and bone cells. Extracellular calcium homeostasis in vertebrate animals is primarily under the endocrine control of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1The abbreviations used are: PTH, parathyroid hormone; PTH1R, type 1 PTH and PTH-related peptide receptor; hPTH1R, human PTH1R; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; EBP50, ezrin-binding protein 50; NHERF1, Na/H exchange regulatory factor 1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; DCT, distal convoluted tubule; PCT, proximal convoluted tubule; SaOS, human osteosarcoma cells; ROS, rat osteosarcoma cells; HA, hemagglutinin./type I PTH receptor (PTH1R). The PTH1R, predominantly expressed in kidney and bone cells, belongs to class B of the large superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that consists of receptors for peptide hormones and neuropeptides (1Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Class B GPCRs are characterized by a common topology and by their ability to couple to multiple signaling pathways via distinct G proteins. PTH is synthesized by the parathyroid glands as a mature peptide of 84 amino acids that is stored in secretory vesicles and dense core granules. Reductions of extracellular calcium levels are detected by the calcium-sensing receptor on parathyroid chief cells and promote the release of PTH, which acts on bone (to increase resorption) and kidney (to augment reabsorption), thereby restoring serum calcium levels. PTH-(1–84) is usually the major form of PTH secreted by the parathyroid glands. However, recent analyses reveal that PTH fragments that are likely to be PTH-(7–84) are also secreted by the parathyroid glands and generated by peripheral metabolism (2John M.R. Goodman W.G. Gao P.

Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 147: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These PTH fragments or their synthetic analogs are thought to be inactive on the PTH1R because, despite binding to the receptor, they fail to promote activation of the classical effectors adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C (4Tamura T.

Federico P. Potts Jr., J.T. Rosenblatt M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7557-7560Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As with most GPCRs, the responses of the PTH1R to agonists are regulated by multiple mechanisms, including a well characterized and highly conserved process involving receptor phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (9Dicker F.

These processes contribute directly to PTH1R desensitization by facilitating the uncoupling of the receptor from its cognate G proteins, Gs and Gq. Following desensitization, the PTH1R is endocytosed into intracellular compartments, from which it can be either recycled to the membrane, leading to receptor resensitization (14Chauvin S. Bencsik M. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2720-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), or targeted for degradation, leading to receptor down-regulation (15Tian J. Smogorzewski M. Kedes L. Massry S.G. Am. J. Nephrol. 1994; 14: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Urena P. Kubrusly M. Mannstadt M. Hruby M. Trinh M.M. Silve C. Lacour B. Abou-Samra A.B. Segre G.V. Drueke T. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 605-611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence demonstrates that PTH1R activation and endocytosis can be dissociated, with each event requiring distinct and specific receptor conformational states. PTH peptide analogs that efficiently activate the PTH1R but fail to induce arrestin-mediated internalization have been described (17Bisello A. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Monticelli L. Mierke D.F. Ferrari S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38524-38530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Conversely, PTH1R mutants have been generated that exhibit impaired ability to transduce G protein-mediated signaling but are phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and internalized in response to PTH-(1–34) (18Vilardaga J.P. Frank M. Krasel C. Dees C. Nissenson R.A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that PTH analogs that are unable to activate the PTH1R may be capable of inducing receptor endocytosis. In the present work, we tested this hypothesis. We now show that amino-terminally truncated PTH peptides internalize the PTH1R without antecedent or concomitant activation. We uncovered the molecular mechanism underlying this novel phenomenon and found that it occurs in a cell-specific manner that depends on the expression of the scaffolding protein EBP50, also known as NHERF1. 2In the present work, we use the terms NHERF1 (EBP50) and NHERF2 (E3KARP) to distinguish between the two forms of NHERF. NHERF1 is a cytoplasmic adaptor protein that contains tandem PDZ domains that have been implicated in protein targeting and in the assembly of protein complexes (19Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 20Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F389-F395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NHERF1 also possesses an ERM domain, which binds to the actin-associated proteins, ezrin, radixin, moesin, and merlin (21Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). NHERF1 recruits various cellular receptors, ion transporters, and other proteins to the plasma membrane of epithelia and other cells (22Voltz J.W. Weinman E.J. Shenolikar S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6309-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recently, Mahon and co-workers (23Mahon M.J. Donowitz M. Yun C.C. Segre G.V. Nature. 2002; 417: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) reported that NHERF1 and -2 bind to the PTH1R through a COOH-terminal PDZ recognition motif and determined a role for NHERF2 in PTH signaling. Our findings demonstrate a novel action for NHERF1 as a molecular switch that determines the conditional efficacy of PTH fragments in bone and kidney cells. Additionally, the results establish the existence of distinct endocytic pathways for the PTH1R in response to either agonists or nonactivating PTH fragments. As such, they provide a new cellular mechanism for the regulation of GPCR function. Cell Culture—The preparation, subcloning, characterization, and culture conditions for kidney and bone cells were as described (24Friedman P.A. Gesek F.A. Morley P. Whitfield J.F. Willick G.E. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Ferrari S.L. Traianedes K. Thorne M. Lafage-Proust M.H. Genever P. Cecchini M.G. Behar V. Bisello A. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Suva L.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Kidney cells were grown in a 50:50 mix of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Hamm's F-12 (10-092-CV; Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA), supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 1% PSN (5 mg of penicillin, 5 mg of streptomycin, and 10 mg of neomycin/ml; Invitrogen). SaOS2 cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HEK-293 and ROS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections of HEK-293 cells grown to 75–90% confluence were performed using FuGENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Empty pcDNA3 vector was added to keep constant the total DNA amount added per plate. Cells grown on 100-mm (DCT) and 60-mm (ROS) plates were transfected using 6 μg of total DNA. DCT and ROS cells stably expressing NHERF1 were generated by transiently transfecting NHERF1 cDNA in pcDNA 3.1 Hygro using FuGENE 6™. After 48 h, transiently transfected cells were trypsinized and plated on 150-mm dishes containing culture medium supplemented with 300 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) to select stable transfectants. Complementary DNA Constructs—pEGFP-N2 plasmid encoding a full-length human PTH1R carboxyl-terminal EGFP fusion protein (PTH1R/C-EGFP) was kindly provided by C. Silve (INSERM, Paris, France). The PTH1R with EGFP introduced in the E2 extracellular domain (PTH1R/N-EGFP) has been previously described (26Tawfeek H.A. Che J. Qian F. Abou-Samra A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E545-E557PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the terminal amino acid of PTH1R, in PTH1R/C-EGFP, from methionine to alanine (M593A) was performed by PCR using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The fidelity of the construct was confirmed by sequencing (ABI PRISM 377; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and subsequent sequence alignment (NCBI BLAST) with human PTH1R (GenBank™ accession number XM 002895). Cyclic AMP and Inositol Phosphate Assays—Ligand-stimulated accumulation of cAMP was determined in the presence of 1 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis was determined in the presence of 10 mm LiCl. cAMP and total inositol phosphates were measured chromatographically as previously described (17Bisello A. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Monticelli L. Mierke D.F. Ferrari S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38524-38530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Receptor Internalization—PTH1R internalization was measured by quantitative, live cell confocal fluorescence microscopy in cells stably transfected with the hPTH1R-EGFP. Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 25-mm glass coverslips and analyzed at room temperature by confocal microscopy (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with a 488-nm argon/krypton laser. Emitted fluorescence was detected with a 515–540-nm band pass filter. PTH1R/EGFP internalization was analyzed by selecting the entire plasma membrane through a plane normal to and ∼2–3 μm above the basal membrane surface (ImageScan; Amersham Biosciences). Sequential images were acquired at 1-min intervals. After obtaining three control images, the indicated ligand was introduced, and images were obtained for an additional 15–30 min to ensure that internalization was complete with any given maneuver. Internalization of PTH1R/EGFP was reflected by a loss of plasma membrane fluorescence, quantified as changes in pixel intensity. Fluorescence intensity was digitized at 16-bit resolution and converted to 256 grayscale levels for each image. The product of the number of pixels within the defined membrane area and the average pixel intensity was calculated for each time point. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the data to a sigmoidal nonlinear equation, where PTH1R internalization = bottom + (top - bottom)/(1 + 10(log EC50-log[PTH])) and plotted using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. for the indicated number of independent observations. Radioligand Binding and Internalization—Cells (100,000–200,000) prepared as described above were incubated on ice for 2 h with ∼100,000 cpm of high pressure liquid chromatography-purified [125I][Nle8,18,Tyr34]PTH-(1–34)NH2 in 250 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, essentially as described (27Malecz N. Bambino T. Bencsik M. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1846-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In brief, cells grown to confluence in 24-well plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature (to achieve equilibrium binding). Under these conditions, the concentration of radioligand was ∼0.1 nm. Following incubation, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected in 0.5 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, and bound [125I]PTH was assessed by γ spectrometry. Ligand internalization was measured as follows. Cells (100,000–200,000) were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum at room temperature. At the indicated time points, surface-bound ligand was extracted by two 5-min incubations on ice with 50 mm glycine buffer (pH 3.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl. After acid extraction, the remaining cell-associated (internalized) radioligand was collected in 0.5 ml of 0.1 n NaOH. The amount of radioligand in each fraction was assessed by γ spectrometry. Radioligand internalization is expressed as the ratio (percentage) of internalized fraction over the total cell-associated ligand (surface plus internalized). Nonspecific binding and internalization were measured in parallel experiments carried out in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled PTH-(1–34). Curves were fit using a four-point logistic algorithm (Prism, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Arrestin Translocation—DCT cells grown on 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with 1 μg of β-arrestin-2/GFP and 5 μg of hPTH1R-pcDNA3 (courtesy of Dr. Marc Caron, Duke University). After 48 h, the cells were split onto collagen-coated 25-mm coverslips. Arrestin translocation in response to PTH ligands was assessed at room temperature using real time live cell confocal microscopy as reported (29Rapacciuolo A. Suvarna S. Barki-Harrington L. Luttrell L.M. Cong M. Lefkowitz R.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35403-35411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Dynamin Dependence—DCT cells were split onto 25-mm coverslips and transiently transfected with 1 μg of PTH1R/EGFP in the presence of 1 μg of K44A-dynamin-pcDNA3.1 (Dr. Orson Moe, University of Texas, Dallas) or empty pcDNA3.1 vector. PTH1R internalization in response to PTH ligands was then measured and quantified as outlined previously. Coimmunoprecipitation—Six-well plates of HEK-293 cells were transfected with the different combinations of DNA constructs as indicated. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 800 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Na2P2O7, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (9 nm pepstatin, 9 nm antipain, 10 nm leupeptin, and 10 nm chymostatin) (Sigma). After lysis for 60 min at 4 °C, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Four μg of specific anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were added to the supernatant. After a 60-min incubation at 4 °C, 50 μl of 50% protein A-agarose pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer was added, followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged for 1 min in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by the addition of 50 μl of SDS sample buffer followed by a 30-min incubation at room temperature. Initial lysates and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using specific antibodies. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were grown to confluence in T-25 flasks, trypsinized, and collected by centrifugation. The resultant cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Total protein concentrations were measured (Bio-Rad Dc Protein Assay). 30 μg of lysate (solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer) were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp.) according to standard methods. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween-20 (TBST), incubated with polyclonal anti-EBP50 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents) at 1:1000 dilution for 4 h at room temperature, washed, and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) at 1:5000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized with a luminol-based enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Statistics—Data are presented as means ± S.E., where n indicates the number of independent experiments. Effects of experimental treatments were assessed by paired comparisons within experiments and reported as the mean ± S.E. of n independent experiments. Paired results were compared by analysis of variance with post-test repeated measures analyzed by the Bonferroni procedure. Single comparisons to control were analyzed by Dunnett's test (Prism; GraphPad). Differences greater than p ≤ 0.05 were assumed to be significant. PTH1R and PTH Endocytosis—The PTH1R and PTH-(1–34) were simultaneously localized in DCT cells stably expressing a human PTH1R COOH-terminally tagged with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (PTH1R/C-EGFP) as previously described (17Bisello A. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Monticelli L. Mierke D.F. Ferrari S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38524-38530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 28Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 30Zhang P. Jobert A.S. Couvineau A. Silve C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 3365-3368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to rhodamine-tagged PTH-(1–34) (rhoPTH(1–34) in Fig. 1). Initially, the PTH1R was largely limited to the plasma membrane, although some cytoplasmic and perinuclear fluorescence is evident (Fig. 1). The ligand was restricted to the plasma membrane. When the fluorescence images for receptor (green) and ligand (red) were merged, only PTH1R at the plasma membrane was associated with ligand (yellow). After 15 min, little PTH1R or PTH-(1–34) remained at the plasma membrane. The decreases of PTH1R and PTH fluorescence at the plasma membrane were accompanied by concomitant increases of cytoplasmic PTH1R/C-EGFP and rhodamine-labeled PTH-(1–34) fluorescence. These results are consistent with the view that PTH and the PTH1R colocalize and internalize together in response to receptor occupancy. Cell- and Ligand-specific Internalization of the PTH1R—We determined the kinetics of PTH1R internalization by real time, quantitative confocal fluorescence microscopy monitoring of membrane-delimited fluorescence intensity of the PTH1R/C-EGFP fusion protein in live cells. Upon the addition of 10-7m PTH-(1–34), PTH1R internalization began after a latency of 6–7 min and reached 50% at 15 min (Fig. 2A). The results obtained on single cells by fluorescent imaging were independently corroborated by measuring internalization of radiolabeled PTH-(1–34) in large (>100,000) populations of cells. Ligand internalization paralleled that of the receptor. During the first 5 min, less than 5% of [125I]PTH-(1–34) was sequestered and 50% was endocytosed by 15 min (Fig. 2B). These findings demonstrate that the PTH1R and PTH-(1–34) traffic together and are internalized in a spatially and temporally congruent manner. The results qualitatively and quantitatively validate the optical determination of PTH1R endocytosis. PTH-(1–34) also internalized the PTH1R in kidney proximal tubule (PCT) cells (Fig. 2A). Internalization began promptly without delay in PCT cells but by 15 min reached levels equivalent (50%) to that in DCT cells. We next examined the effects of the PTH antagonist PTH-(7–34) on PTH1R internalization. As expected, PTH-(7–34) (10-7m) did not promote PTH1R internalization in PCT cells (Fig. 2C). However, PTH-(7–34) promptly and efficiently induced receptor sequestration in kidney DCT cells. PTH1R endocytosis evoked by PTH-(7–34) was greater (82 ± 4.2 versus 49 ± 3.7%, p < 0.01) and more rapid (t = 2.5 versus >8 min) than that elicited by PTH-(1–34). From concentration dependence curves, half-maximal internalization (EC50) of the PTH1R occurred at 0.90 × 10-9m PTH-(1–34) and 10-8m for PTH-(7–34). We confirmed that PTH-(7–34) lacks agonist activity (31Horiuchi N. Holick M.F. Potts Jr., J.T. Rosenblatt M. Science. 1983; 220: 1053-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 32Goldman M.E. McKee R.L. Caulfield M.P. Reagan J.E. Levy J.J. Gay C.T. DeHaven P.A. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2597-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In DCT cells, 10-7m PTH-(7–34) had no effect on either adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C, whereas PTH-(1–34) activated both adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C (21.4 ± 0.1- and 3.2 ± 0.5-fold, respectively). These results additionally substantiate that EGFP ligation to the intracellular tail of the PTH1R does not interfere with its signaling in DCT cells, as in HEK-293 cells or COS cells (17Bisello A. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Monticelli L. Mierke D.F. Ferrari S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38524-38530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To verify that the observed ligand-specific internalization effects of PTH-(7–34) were not due to the presence of EGFP on the intracellular tail of the PTH1R/C-EGFP, identical experiments were performed with a PTH1R, where EGFP is located in the extracellular domain (PTH1R/N-EGFP) (26Tawfeek H.A. Che J. Qian F. Abou-Samra A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E545-E557PubMed Google Scholar). We previously established that this receptor construct signals and traffics normally in response to PTH-(1–34) in LLC-PK1 kidney cells (26Tawfeek H.A. Che J. Qian F. Abou-Samra A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E545-E557PubMed Google Scholar). PTH1R/N-EGFP internalization induced by PTH-(7–34) was 76 ± 8.7% at 15 min and did not differ from that of the PTH1R/C-EGFP, 81 ± 4.2%. PTH-(1–34) also efficiently internalized the PTH1R/N-EGFP. Thus, the functional properties of the PTH1R/C-EGFP and PTH1R/N-EGFP are not different from the native receptor. The actions of PTH-(1–84) and PTH-(7–84) were assessed to determine if the full-length circulating forms of PTH exerted similar effects on PTH1R internalization. At comparable peptide concentrations (10-7m), these naturally occurring forms of PTH evoked PTH1R endocytosis in DCT cells that was indistinguishable from that displayed by their respective shorter synthetic analogs (Fig. 2D). Similar cell-specific effects of PTH-(1–34) and PTH-(7–34) on PTH1R internalization were observed in two bone-derived cell lines, human SaOS2 and rat ROS 17/2.8 cells (Fig. 2E). In SaOS2 cells, as in PCT kidney cells, only PTH-(1–34) induced PTH1R internalization. In contrast, in ROS cells both PTH-(1–34) and PTH-(7–34) induced PTH1R endocytosis, similar to kidney DCT cells. NHERF1 Expression Determines PTH-(7–34) Effects on PTH1R Endocytosis—NHERF1 is expressed by PCT and SaOS2 cells (Fig. 3), where PTH-(7–34) has no effect on PTH1R internalization, but not by DCT or ROS cells (Fig. 3), where PTH-(7–34) induces endocytosis (33Breton S. Wiederhold T. Marshansky V. Nsumu N.N. Ramesh V. Brown D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18219-18224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 34Wade J.B. Welling P.A. Donowitz M. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C192-C198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we theorized that the presence or absence of NHERF1 determines the cell-specific pattern of internalization of PTH1R in response to inactive PTH peptides. To test this idea, we introduced NHERF1 in cells normally lacking it and determined the effect of PTH-(7–34) on PTH1R internalization. DCT and ROS cells were stably transfected with NHERF1. DCT/NHERF1 cells exhibited PTH1R internalization in response to PTH-(1–34) similar to that seen in vector-transfected or non-transfected control cells (Fig. 4A). Now, however, PTH1R internalization in response to PTH-(7–34) was significantly attenuated (Fig. 4A). PTH-(7–34)-induced PTH1R internalization was also largely inhibited in ROS cells stably expressing NHERF1 (Fig. 4B). PTH-(1–34) and PTH-(7–34) promoted the internalization of a PTH1R tagged with EGFP in the extracellular domain (PTH1R/N-EGFP) (Fig. 4C). NHERF1 similarly inhibited PTH-(7–34)-induced internalization of the PTH1R/N-EGFP as it did the PTH1R/C-EGFP (Fig. 4C). PTH-(1–34)-stimulated PTH1R/N-EGFP endocytosis was not affected. Thus, the actions of NHERF1 are independent of the location of EGFP within the PTH1R. The role of NHERF1 in determining sensitivity to PTH-(7–34) was further and independently established by expressing a dominant negative form of NHERF1 (NHERH-(1–326), NHERF1ΔERM) (35Weinman E.J.

The molecular identity of these channels is not known. Ectopic expression of the raft-associated tetraspan protein CD20 in Chinese hamster ovary cells introduced a novel SOC entry pathway that was permeable to strontium as well as to calcium. The activity of this SOC pathway was abolished by deletion of a cytoplasmic sequence in CD20 essential for its efficient raft localization. Strontium-permeable SOC channels were detected in B cells, and B cell receptor-stimulated influx was significantly reduced by downregulation of CD20 expression using short interfering RNA and also by cholesterol depletion. This is the first evidence that raft-associated CD20 constitutes a component of a SOC entry pathway activated by the B cell receptor.

The function of CD20, a tetraspan transmembrane protein expressed in B lymphocytes, is not yet fully elucidated, although electrophysiological evidence of calcium channel activity has been reported. Increased Ca2+ conductance, detected by whole cell patch clamp recordings, was induced by membrane hyperpolarization in a variety of cell types expressing CD20 ectopically and was similar to the native conductance found in B cells (1Bubien J.K.

Receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C and consequent inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production leads to rapid release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. Store depletion activates Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane, replenishing empty stores and providing a sustained increase in the concentration of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c). The Ca2+ influx has been termed capacitative or store-operated Ca2+ (SOC) 1The abbreviations used are: SOC, store-operated calcium; TRP, transient receptor potential; CRAC, Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GMI, Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4(NeuAcα2,3)Gal-β1,4Glcβ1,1-ceramide; siRNA, short interfering RNA; BCR, B cell receptor; ANOVA, analysis of variance; Tg, thapsigargin; MBC, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; SOSr, store-operated Sr2+; 0Ca, Ca2+-free buffer containing 0.2 mm EGTA.1The abbreviations used are: SOC, store-operated calcium; TRP, transient receptor potential; CRAC, Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GMI, Galβ1,3GalNAcβ1,4(NeuAcα2,3)Gal-β1,4Glcβ1,1-ceramide; siRNA, short interfering RNA; BCR, B cell receptor; ANOVA, analysis of variance; Tg, thapsigargin; MBC, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; SOSr, store-operated Sr2+; 0Ca, Ca2+-free buffer containing 0.2 mm EGTA. entry and is essential for regulating diverse cellular responses to receptor-mediated stimuli, including enzyme activation, gene expression, secretion, and cell division (5Putney Jr., J.W.

Electrophysiological studies distinguish several classes of SOC channels, including the highly Ca2+-selective Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel described in mast cells and T lymphocytes and others with distinct characteristics (7Lewis R.S.

The mammalian homologues of the Drosophila transient receptor potential (TRP) gene products, now forming a TRP superfamily with more than 20 members in 3 subfamilies (9Montell C. Birnbaumer L.

All TRPs apparently form cation channels but with variable selectivity and activation properties (10Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev.

Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar). As in other cell types, B lymphocytes activate Ca2+ entry after store-depletion, but the molecular components and the mechanism of activation of the SOC channels are unclear. Recently, TRPC1, for which there is evidence of store-operated, diacylglycerol, or receptor-mediated channel activity in other cell types (10Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar), was genetically disrupted in chicken DT40 B cells and found to reduce but not ablate SOC entry (13Mori Y. Wakamori M. Miyakawa T. Hermosura M. Hara Y. Nishida M. Hirose K. Mizushima A. Kurosaki M. Mori E. Gotoh K. Okada T. Fleig A. Penner R. Iino M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This suggests that TRPC1 may form SOC channels in B cells and also indicates the existence of additional SOC entry pathways. In this report we demonstrate that CD20, when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, dramatically enhanced SOC entry through strontium-permeable ion channels, providing the first evidence that CD20 is a component of a SOC entry pathway. In B cells, short interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced both CD20 expression and B cell receptor (BCR)-stimulated strontium and calcium entry. Cholesterol depletion or deletion of a 7-residue cytoplasmic CD20 sequence that controls its localization to cholesterol-dependent membrane microdomains, i.e. lipid rafts, inhibited SOC entry, suggesting the involvement of rafts in regulating CD20 SOC activity. Cell Lines and Culture—Ramos, BJAB, and Molt-4 cells were maintained in RMPI, 10% fetal bovine serum, and CHO cells in α-minimum Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. Antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen) was added to all cell culture media. Molt-4 T cells expressing CD20 or CD20 deletion constructs were described previously (14Polyak M.J. Tailor S.H. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3242-3248PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells were transfected with CD20 cDNA or deletion mutants in BCMGSneo vector or vector alone as described (14Polyak M.J. Tailor S.H. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3242-3248PubMed Google Scholar). Positive cells were selected by Geneticin (Invitrogen) and further sorted by flow cytometry. For RNA interference experiments, BJAB cells were transfected with 120 pmol of siRNAs in 400 μl of RPMI by electroporation at 300 V and 800 microfarads. Reagents and Antibodies—Fura-2/AM was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Thapsigargin, SKF96365, ionomycin, and BAPTA/AM were purchased from Calbiochem. siRNAs against CD20 (CCACTCTTCAGGAGGATGT) and control (GCGCGCTTTGTAGGATTCG) were purchased from Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO). All other chemicals were from Sigma. Mouse IgG2a isotype control antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody were purchased from Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. (Birmingham, AL), and mouse B1 monoclonal antibody (IgG2a) against human CD20 was from Coulter Corp. (Hialeah, FL). For immunoblotting, anti-Gαi antibody was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Boston, MA), and anti-CD45 and anti-caveolin antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); rabbit antiserum generated against a CD20 C-terminal peptide was described previously (15Petrie R.J. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cholera toxin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Sigma. Calcium Solutions and Fura-2 Imaging—All buffers contained 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. CaCl2 and SrCl2 were added to the buffer at 1 mm final concentration as indicated. Ca2+-free buffer contained 0.2 mm EGTA. CHO cells were grown on glass cover slips in 0.05% fetal bovine serum for 2-3 days before the experiment. Ramos and BJAB cells were grown in normal culture medium and adhered to poly-lysine-coated cover slips by low speed centrifugation on the day of the experiment. The cells were loaded with fura-2 by incubation in 5 μm fura-2/AM in HEPES buffer with 1 mm Ca2+ for 40-50 min at room temperature followed by washing and a further 15-20-min incubation to ensure full de-esterification. Digital imaging of fura-2 fluorescence was performed using the ImageMaster system from Photon Technology International, Inc. (Lawrenceville, NJ), essentially as described previously (16Tsoi M. Rhee K.H. Bungard D. Li X.F. Lee S.L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4155-4162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The images were analyzed to give the averaged background-subtracted ratio of fluorescence excited at 340/380 nm (emission at 510 nm) for all the cells in one field (>20 CHO cells or >100 B cells). To quantitatively describe the Ca2+ or Sr2+ entry, the peak ratio value of the Ca2+ or Sr2+ entry was subtracted by the base-line fura-2 ratio value, and this gives Ca′ or Sr′. The Ca′ or Sr′ was then divided by ATP′, Tg′, or IgM′ (ATP′, Tg′, or IgM′ are the peak ratio values of Ca2+ release after the stimulation subtracted by the base-line fura-2 ratio value). Statistical significance was tested using Student's t test or ANOVA as indicated. Cell Stimulation and Pretreatment Conditions—ATP and thapsigargin (Tg) were used at 100 μm and 1 μm final concentration, respectively. Tg was delivered to the chamber by pipetting in a 1-ml volume and was maintained for about 10-20 min. ATP was added to the flow solution and maintained after addition. SKF96365 was added to the EGTA buffer at 50 μm final concentration and maintained for about 9 min. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBC) and cholesterol/MBC (11:181 weight ratio) were used to pretreat cells at 2% (w/v) for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody was used at 1 μg/106 cells. Flow Cytometry—Transfected BJAB or CHO cells were incubated with B1 anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The data were acquired using a FACScan (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and analyzed using the FlowJo program (Tree Star, Inc., San Carlos, CA). Lipid Raft Isolation and Immunoblotting—Sample preparation for sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was described previously (17Deans J.P. Robbins S.M. Polyak M.J. Savage J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 344-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, 108 BJAB, Ramos, or Molt4 cells or 5 × 107 CHO cells were lysed in 1% Brij58. Sucrose was added to a final concentration of 40% and overlayered with 5 ml of 30% sucrose and 5 ml of 5% sucrose. Samples were centrifuged for 17 h at 37,000 rpm using a Beckman XL-70 ultracentrifuge with a SW 41 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments). Eight fractions (1.5 ml each) were collected from top to bottom, and the pellet was dissolved in SDS sample buffer (fraction 9). Equal aliquots of each fraction were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (PAGE) and run at constant voltage. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) for immunoblotting, and bound horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were detected by SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). For GM1 detection, aliquots of each fraction were spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and blotted with cholera toxin-horseradish peroxidase. The images were acquired and analyzed using a Fluor-S MAX MultiImager and Quantity One software, respectively (Bio-Rad). Novel SOC Entry in CD20-expressing CHO Cells—CHO cells expressing exogenous CD20 or control CHO cells transfected with vector alone were loaded with the calcium-sensitive dye, fura-2, and the fluorescence values in a field of >20 cells were recorded during the perfusion of various reagents. Intracellular stores were depleted either by receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C/inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate pathways using ATP (18Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar) or with Tg, a specific inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticular Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) (19Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2998) Google Scholar). We then tested both Sr2+ and Ca2+ entry after store depletion because Sr2+ entry can distinguish endogenous SOC channels from exogenously expressed channels in some cases (20Ma H.T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, no difference in base-line fluorescence was detected between the control and CD20-expressing CHO cells. ATP sharply increased [Ca2+]c in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ in both cell lines, as expected. [Ca2+]c gradually returned to base line, presumably due to extrusion mechanisms at the plasma membrane and possibly by uptake into internal organelles (21Bootman M.D. Collins T.J. Peppiatt C.M. Prothero L.S. Mackenzie L. de Smet P. Travers M. Tovey S.C. Seo J.T. Berridge M.J. Ciccolini F. Lipp P. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Subsequent perfusion of Sr2+ induced a large increase in the fluorescence ratio in CD20-transfected cells, suggesting that influx of Sr2+ occurred in these cells in response to store depletion. Vector-transfected cells did not respond significantly to Sr2+, indicating that endogenous SOC channels are relatively impermeable to Sr2+ under the experimental conditions used. The store-operated Sr2+ (SOSr) entry after ATP stimulation in CD20-transfected CHO cells was reproducibly about four times greater than that in vector-transfected CHO cells (Table I, first row). There was no Sr2+ entry before store depletion (Fig. 1A), indicating that CD20 expression does not confer constitutive permeability to Sr2+ in CHO cells. The results were averaged from a relatively uniform response of the majority of cells (>85%) as shown in Fig. 1B, which illustrates the fura-2 fluorescence at the time-points indicated as a, b, and c in Fig. 1A.Table IIncreased store-operated cation entry in CD20-transfected CHO cellsVectorCD20nSr′/ATP′0.083 ± 0.0160.332 ± 0.04318p < 0.001Sr′/Tg′0.104 ± 0.0160.483 ± 0.03718-20p < 0.001Ca′/Tg′0.736 ± 0.0912.130 ± 0.14818-20p < 0.001Sr′/Tg′−SKF0.411 ± 0.0457+SKF0.197 ± 0.0317p = 0.002 Open table in a new tab Tg was then used to deplete intracellular stores passively. As observed after receptor-mediated store depletion, Sr2+ entered CD20-transfected CHO cells much more efficiently than control cells after Tg-induced store depletion (Fig. 1C and Table I, second row). After Sr2+ was withdrawn and fluorescence values had returned to base line, Ca2+ was introduced into the perfusion chamber. Influx of Ca2+ into vector-transfected cells indicated that these cells maintained a normal Ca2+ entry pathway after Tg treatment. Calcium influx into CD20-transfected cells was greatly increased over that observed in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1C and Table I, third row). Sr2+ entry into CD20-transfected cells was reduced about 52% by SKF96356 (Table I, fourth row), a channel blocker frequently used to inhibit receptor-activated Ca2+ entry (22Merritt J.E. Armstrong W.P. Benham C.D. Hallam T.J. Jacob R. Jaxa-Chamiec A. Leigh B.K. McCarthy S.A. Moores K.E. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), supporting the conclusion that the enhanced Sr2+ entry obtained in CD20-expressing cells is through SOC ion channels. Sr 2+ -permeable CD20 SOC Channels in B Cells—The above results indicated that CD20 has the ability to form and/or organize a SOC entry pathway with some permeability to Sr2+. Because CD20 is normally expressed in B lymphocytes, we then tested whether B cells are permeable to Sr2+ after store depletion. We used Ramos cells, an Epstein-Barr virus-negative, IgM-positive cell line derived from Burkitt's lymphoma. The SOC channels were activated either with anti-IgM to stimulate the BCR (Fig. 2A) or with Tg (Fig. 2B). Sr2+ entry occurred after stimulation with either reagent and was inhibited by SKF96365 (Fig. 2 and Table II, first and second rows). Ca2+ entry was also inhibited by SKF96365 using similar protocols as in Fig. 2 (Table II, third and fourth rows). Thus, Ramos B cells express SOC entry channels that are permeable to Sr2+ and can respond to BCR stimulation.Table IIStore-operated cation entry in B cells reduced by SKF96365 and CD20 down-regulation−SKF+SKFnSr′/IgM′0.388 ± 0.0280.160 ± 0.0277p < 0.001Sr′/Tg′0.710 ± 0.0630.223 ± 0.0477p < 0.001Ca′/IgM′1.218 ± 0.1380.479 ± 0.0254p = 0.002Ca′/Tg′4.871 ± 0.5101.350 ± 0.2517p < 0.001Ca′/BCR′No siRNA1.022 ± 0.10811Control siRNA1.037 ± 0.12711Anti-CD20 siRNA0.656 ± 0.06812p < 0.05 Open table in a new tab Recently, we reported that immediately upon stimulation the BCR translocates into lipid rafts and co-localizes with CD20 (15Petrie R.J. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results together with known modulatory effects of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies on anti-IgM-stimulated proliferative responses (23Tedder T.F. Engel P. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 450-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) suggest a functional association between CD20 and the BCR. To directly assess the contribution of CD20 to BCR-mediated SOC entry in B cells we used the RNA interference technique (24McManus M.T. Sharp P.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar) to down-regulate CD20 expression in the transfectable human B cell line BJAB. Short interfering RNA was designed to target the region of CD20 mRNA that is 96-115 nucleotides downstream of the translational start site. Two days after transfection, CD20 surface expression was reliably and specifically reduced by 40% as compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 2C). Expression of the BCR was unchanged (Fig. 2C). BCR-mediated SOSr entry was significantly inhibited after down-regulation of CD20 expression with anti-CD20 siRNA, whereas control siRNA had no effect (Fig. 2, D and E). Inhibition of CD20 expression and SOSr entry were both dose-dependent effects of anti-CD20 siRNA (not shown). Inhibition of CD20 expression also inhibited Ca2+ entry after BCR stimulation using the same protocol as in Fig. 2D but substituting Sr2+ with Ca2+ (Table II, fifth row). CD20 Is Constitutively Associated with Membrane Rafts—Previously, we reported that CD20 is soluble in 1% Triton X-100 but becomes insoluble after antibody ligation and floats on sucrose density gradients, consistent with the interpretation that it inducibly associates with lipid rafts (17Deans J.P. Robbins S.M. Polyak M.J. Savage J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 344-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, Brij58, a less stringent detergent than Triton X-100, reveals raft association that may be of lower affinity than observed with Triton X-100. Indeed, we found that when unstimulated B cells were lysed in 1% Brij58, CD20 associated with the low density fractions (Fig. 3A, upper panel), indicating that it may be constitutively raft-associated. CD20 co-fractionated on the gradients with ganglioside GM1 and Gαi, a subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins that is localized to rafts (Fig. 3A, upper panel). CD45 is excluded from rafts and was not detected in the buoyant fractions of Brij58 lysates, consistent with other reports (25Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 26Cheng P.C. Dykstra M.L. Mitchell R.N. Pierce S.K. J. Exp.

Immunol. 2000; 12: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and confirming that the Brij58-insoluble membrane fragments isolated in our experiments did not non-specifically include an abundant non-raft protein. Data derived from BJAB cells are shown in Fig. 3A. Similar data were obtained using Ramos cells (not shown). Lipid raft microdomains are enriched in cholesterol, which appears to be necessary to maintain their integrity (28Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5152) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of BJAB cells with the cholesterol-extraction drug MBC reduced the buoyancy of CD20 in the sucrose gradients, demonstrating the cholesterol dependence of CD20-raft association (Fig. 3A, lower panel). Previously, we identified a short membrane-proximal cytoplasmic sequence (residues 219-225) that was critical for antibody-induced CD20 insolubility in 1% Triton X-100 (14Polyak M.J. Tailor S.H. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3242-3248PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether this sequence was a determinant of constitutive raft association of CD20, lipid rafts were isolated from Molt-4 T cells transfected with either full-length CD20 cDNA (WT) or the Δ219-225 deletion mutant. The results show that deletion of residues 219-225 largely prevented the association of CD20 with the buoyant fractions of sucrose gradients (Fig. 3B). MBC Inhibits SOSr Entry in Ramos Cells—Depletion of cholesterol by MBC affects various cellular functions, including receptor-mediated signaling events (28Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5152) Google Scholar), and specific effects of MBC on SOC entry have been observed in other systems (29Lockwich T.P. Liu X. Singh B.B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11934-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 30Barabe F. Pare G. Fernandes M.J. Bourgoin S.G. Naccache P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13473-13478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because CD20 was found to be constitutively raft-associated, the effect of MBC on SOSr entry in Ramos B cells was investigated. Cells pretreated with MBC were exposed to F(ab′)2 anti-IgM to stimulate the BCR. Consistent with our previous report that MBC treatment had no inhibitory effect on tyrosine phosphorylation events or on calcium mobilization after BCR stimulation (31Petrie R.J. Schnetkamp P.P. Patel K.D. Awasthi-Kalia M. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1220-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), MBC-treated Ramos cells had normal BCR-mediated Ca2+ release (Fig. 4A). Sr2+ entry, however, was significantly reduced in MBC-treated cells as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 4, A and C) but was normal in cells treated with cholesterol-loaded MBC (Fig. 4, B and C), indicating a cholesterol-specific inhibitory effect of MBC on the entry pathway. SOSr Entry in Transfected CHO Cells Is Ablated by Deletion of Residues 219-225—Because residues 219-225 were found to be required for efficient association of CD20 with lipid rafts, we tested whether these residues altered store-operated cation influx in transfected CHO cells. Constructs encoding CD20(Δ219-225) and CD20(ΔN2-50), for comparison, were expressed in CHO cells. The expression levels of these constructs were similar to one another (Fig. 5A) but were significantly lower than the expression level of native CD20 used for the experiments shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, a second line of CHO cells was derived that expressed full-length CD20 at a similar level to the deletion mutants (Fig. 5A). SOSr entry was compared in the two CHO cell lines expressing different amounts of full-length CD20 (Fig. 5B, top two panels) and was found to be significantly lower in cells with reduced CD20 expression (Fig. 5C). Deletion of the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of CD20 had no significant effect on Sr2+ entry when compared with cells expressing a similar level of full-length CD20, whereas the 219-225 deletion abolished CD20-mediated Sr2+ entry after store depletion (Fig. 5, B and C). Constitutive raft association of ectopically expressed CD20 in CHO cells was demonstrated (Fig. 5D). Deletion of residues 219-225 significantly reduced buoyancy of CD20 on the density gradient, whereas the N-terminal deletion had little effect (Fig. 5, D and E). Caveolin localization in the raft fractions as a control was not changed by the expression of any of the CD20 constructs. This paper is the first report of an integral membrane protein outside of the TRP family functioning as a component of a SOC entry pathway. Like a number of known calcium channel components, CD20 is a phosphoprotein with four transmembrane spans and cytoplasmic termini containing no intrinsic enzymatic activity or recognized protein interaction domains or motifs. The 33-kDa monomer immunoprecipitates as dimers and tetramers after chemical cross-linking of cell-surface proteins (1Bubien J.K. Zhou L.J. Bell P.D. Frizzell R.A. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and is assembled into ∼200-kDa complexes containing CD20 as the major component (32Polyak M.J. Deans J.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3256-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As shown here, SOSr entry into transfected CHO cells correlated with the level of CD20 expression and was abolished by mutagenesis of CD20. Together, these findings support a direct role for CD20 in ion channel formation. SOC entry in hematopoietic cells appears to be mediated by ICRAC channels, as described most clearly in mast cells and Jurkat T cells (6Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 7Lewis R.S. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 279-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). SOC channels distinct from ICRAC are known in other cell types (33Vaca L. Kunze D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C920-C925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Trepakova E.S. Gericke M. Hirakawa Y. Weisbrod R.M. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7782-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) but so far have not been described in cells of the hematopoietic lineage. A similarity between ICRAC and the CD20-mediated current has been noted (1Bubien J.K. Zhou L.J. Bell P.D. Frizzell R.A. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar); both are inwardly rectified and voltage-insensitive with similar electrophysiological properties. ICRAC is highly permeable to Ca2+ over Na+ and has selectivity for divalent ions, with Ca2+ > Ba2+ = Sr2+ (6Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). ICRAC current has not been described in mammalian B lymphocytes but was reported recently in avian (DT40) B cells (35Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Physiol. 2001; 536: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 36Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Shcheynikov N. Kurosaki T. Muallem S. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of the ion selectivity of the CD20-mediated current has not been determined, although a previous report showed a well conducted Ba2+ current mediated by CD20 (1Bubien J.K. Zhou L.J. Bell P.D. Frizzell R.A. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Our results show that the CD20 SOC was permeable to strontium. The fura-2 imaging data show that Sr2+ entered the cells more slowly than Ca2+; this may reflect greater selectivity of the channel for Ca2+ than for Sr2+ or it may be attributed to differences between Sr2+ and Ca2+ with respect to fura-2 binding rates or affinities (37Schilling W.P. Rajan L. Strobl-Jager E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12838-12848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, our data do not address whether the channel is ICRAC or a non-ICRAC SOC but complement previous electrophysiological analyses, supporting the possibility that CD20 might mediate ICRAC in B cells. The plasma membrane appears to be structurally compartmentalized to allow separation, aggregation, and cross-talk of signaling events to occur. Lipid raft microdomains currently provide the best example of membrane heterogeneity regulating signal transduction. A variety of signaling molecules either constitutively or inducibly associate with membrane rafts, including components of the calcium release pathway (38Isshiki M. Anderson R.G. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 39Guo B. Kato R.M. Garcia-Lloret M. Wahl M.I. Rawlings D.J. Immunity. 2000; 13: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Characteristically, proteins associated with rafts are insoluble in the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 and can be distinguished from the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton by their low density on sucrose gradients. CD20 is soluble in 1% Triton X-100 but becomes insoluble after antibody ligation and floats on sucrose density gradients (17Deans J.P. Robbins S.M. Polyak M.J. Savage J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 344-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Previously, we interpreted this to mean that CD20 inducibly associates with lipid rafts. However, it is apparent from the work described here that CD20 is constitutively raft-associated. Although CD20 is soluble in Triton X-100, it is found in low density insoluble membranes isolated using Brij58 (and other non-ionic detergents; data not shown). Low stringency detergent conditions are also necessary to detect localization of the high affinity IgE receptor, FcERI, and CD40 to lipid rafts (40Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 41Hostager B.S. Catlett I.M. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15392-15398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The conclusion that CD20 is constitutively raft-associated is supported by the cholesterol dependence of its buoyancy on sucrose density gradients and by the marked effect of the short membrane-proximal cytoplasmic deletion. The dramatic change in Triton solubility of CD20 that occurs after antibody engagement likely reflects an increased affinity for the raft environment caused by an antibody-mediated conformational change and/or aggregation. BCR-induced SOSr entry was diminished by down-regulation of CD20 expression and by cholesterol depletion, suggesting that SOC entry in B cells required both CD20 and the microenvironment of rafts to function properly. Recently, it was reported that inhibition of Ca2+ mobilization in T cells by MBC could be attributed in part to depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores (42Pizzo P. Giurisato E. Tassi M. Benedetti A. Pozzan T. Viola A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3082-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This was not the case in Ramos B cells because the amount of calcium released from intracellular stores using either ionomycin or BCR stimulation was similar in MBC-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 4 and Ref. 31Petrie R.J. Schnetkamp P.P. Patel K.D. Awasthi-Kalia M. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1220-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Pizzo et al. (42Pizzo P. Giurisato E. Tassi M. Benedetti A. Pozzan T. Viola A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3082-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) also report an MBC-induced change in membrane potential in Jurkat cells, manifested by abrogation of MBC-mediated inhibition of calcium entry when experiments were performed in high K+ buffer. In similar experiments using Ramos cells, inhibition of anti-IgM-stimulated SOSr entry by MBC was still observed, indicating that the effects of MBC on BCR-mediated cation entry cannot be attributed to alterations in membrane potential (data not shown). As suggested previously (43Awasthi-Kalia M. Schnetkamp P.P. Deans J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a fundamental difference in membrane properties and/or antigen receptor signaling of B and T lymphocytes may underlie differences observed in the effects of MBC in these cell populations. Our results are consistent with those from neutrophils and human submandibular gland cells, in which MBC treatment also inhibited SOC entry without affecting calcium release from intracellular stores (29Lockwich T.P.

Bourgoin S.G. Naccache P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13473-13478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Deletion of residues 219-225 diminished both raft localization of ectopically expressed CD20 and its ability to mediate SOSr entry. This deletion does not affect oligomerization of CD20. 2M. J. Polyak and J. P. Deans, unpublished data. Taken together with the inhibitory effect of cholesterol depletion on strontium entry in B cells, the most likely interpretation of these data is that localization of CD20 to rafts is necessary for functioning of the channel. However, it is possible that the 219-225 deletion has other effects, and a detailed molecular analysis will be required to distinguish potentially distinct functions of the 219-225 sequence. CD20 belongs to a family (MS4A) of at least 24 genes sharing sequence homology, particularly in the membrane-spanning regions (44Ishibashi K. Suzuki M. Sasaki S. Imai M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 264: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 45Liang Y. Tedder T.F. Genomics. 2001; 72: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Most MS4A genes are expressed in cells of the hematopoietic system, and a few are also expressed in other tissues. Other members of this family include the Fc receptor β subunit, expressed in mast cells and basophils (46Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 931-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), and HTm4, which is widely expressed in hematopoietic cells on intracellular membranes and is involved in cell cycle regulation (47Donato J.L. Ko J. Kutok J.L. Cheng T. Shirakawa T. Mao X.Q. Beach D. Scadden D.T. Sayegh M.H. Adra C.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The function of other MS4A family members is unknown, and it will be important to determine whether any of them possess SOC channel activity as shown here for CD20. The 219-225 sequence in CD20 is not conserved either among various members of the MS4A family or between murine and human CD20. The localization and/or function of murine CD20 may, therefore, be different from human CD20, potentially accounting for the inability to detect a functional phenotype in CD20-deficient mice (48O'Keefe T.L. Williams G.T. Davies S.L. Neuberger M.S. Immunogenetics. 1998; 48: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In summary, we provide here the first evidence of CD20 involvement in store-operated calcium entry. The topology and quaternary structure of CD20 together with the inhibitory effects of the short cytoplasmic deletion are most suggestive of its direct involvement as a component of the channel itself. Raft association of CD20 appears to be necessary for proper functioning of the channel and couples BCR signals to store-dependent calcium influx in cholesterol-dependent membrane microdomains."

https://openalex.org/W2063060712,"The p53 tumor suppressor is regulated by MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Ubiquitination of p53 is regulated by ARF, which binds to MDM2 and inhibits its E3 ligase function. P53 is also subjected to modification by conjugation of SUMO-1. We found that a p53 mutant deficient for MDM2 binding (p53(14Q19S)) is poorly sumoylated in vivo compared to wild-type p53. Overexpression of MDM2 increases the level of p53 sumoylation, which is further stimulated by expression of ARF. Stimulation of p53 sumoylation requires a highly conserved region (102-116) encoded by exon 2 of ARF and correlates with the ability of ARF to target p53 to the nucleolus. An MDM2 deletion mutant (MDM2(Delta222-437)) with activated cryptic nucleolar localization signal also targets p53 to the nucleolus and efficiently promotes p53 sumoylation in the absence of ARF. Direct targeting of p53 to the nucleolus enhances its sumoylation in an MDM2- and ARF-dependent fashion. These results show that p53 sumoylation is regulated by MDM2- and ARF-mediated nucleolar targeting."
https://openalex.org/W2000590691,"We have analyzed the effects of the endogenous redoxactive agents S-nitrosoglutathione and glutathione disulfide, and the NO donor NOR-3, on calcium release kinetics mediated by ryanodine receptor channels. Incubation of triad-enriched sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from mammalian skeletal muscle with these three agents elicits different responses. Glutathione disulfide significantly reduces the inhibitory effect of Mg2+ without altering Ca2+ activation of release kinetics, whereas NOR-3 enhances Ca2+ activation of release kinetics without altering Mg2+ inhibition. Incubation with S-nitrosoglutathione produces both effects; it significantly enhances Ca2+ activation of release kinetics and diminishes the inhibitory effect of Mg2+ on this process. Triad incubation with [35S]nitrosoglutathione at pCa 5 promoted 35S incorporation into 2.5 cysteine residues per channel monomer; this incorporation decreased significantly at pCa 9.

Chem. 2003; 278: 8184-8189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In particular, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and NO donors modify RyR1 channel activity through S-nitrosylation of a few critical SH residues (13Sun J. Xu L. Eu J.P. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15625-15630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 42Sun J. Xu L. Eu J.P. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8184-8189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, incubation of skeletal SR vesicles with 0.2–1.0 mm GSNO removes more free SH residues than those modified by S-nitrosylation (42Sun J. Xu L. Eu J.P. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8184-8189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that GSNO induces additional SH modifications, which may include S-glutathionylation because in other systems GSNO acts both as S-nitrosylating and S-glutathionylating agent (43Padgett C.M. Whorton A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C739-C749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Ji Y. Akerboom T.P. Sies H. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). S-Glutathionylation, through the formation of a mixed disulfide between a protein SH residue and glutathione (45Lau K.H. Thomas J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2321-2326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and S-nitrosylation appear to be reversible post-translational protein modifications, which may modulate intracellular signaling pathways by targeting critical molecules (46Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). In fact, the activities of several signaling molecules including PP2A (47Rao R.K. Clayton L.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), Ras (48Mallis R.J. Buss J.E. Thomas J.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and NFκB (49Pineda-Molina E. Klatt P. Vazquez J. Marina A. Garcia D.L. Perez-Sala D. Lamas S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14134-14142Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) are modified as a consequence of S-glutathionylation. This reaction is also markedly activated in response to oxidative stress, as shown by redox proteome analysis (50Fratelli M. Demol H. Puype M. Casagrande S. Eberini I. Salmona M. Bonetto V. Mengozzi M. Duffieux F. Miclet E. Bachi A. Vandekerckhove J. Gianazza E. Ghezzi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3505-3510Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 51Lind C. Gerdes R. Hamnell Y. Schuppe-Koistinen I. von Lowenhielm H.B. Holmgren A. Cotgreave I.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 406: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that thimerosal enhances single RyR channel activity both by increasing channel activation by micromolar [Ca2+] and decreasing inhibition by 0.5 mm [Ca2+] (23Marengo J.J. Hidalgo C. Bull R. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1263-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thimerosal, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, also enhances CICR rates from SR vesicles from mammalian skeletal muscle and decreases or abolishes the inhibition of CICR by 1 mm [Mg2+] (20Donoso P. Aracena P. Hidalgo C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 279-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thimerosal, however, is an exogenous organomercapturial compound that modifies SH residues most likely via S-alkylation (52Elferink J.G. Gen. Pharmacol. 1999; 33: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). If endogenous GSNO had the potential to produce similar modifications of RyR channel activity as thimerosal, a significant enhancement of the CICR process would be expected in response to GSNO-induced endogenous redox modification of the channel protein. Therefore, we assessed the ability of GSNO to modify Ca2+ release kinetics and determined whether, in addition to its reported S-nitrosylating activity (42Sun J. Xu L. Eu J.P. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8184-8189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), GSNO also induced S-glutathionylation of RyR1 channels. We found that GSNO produced similar activation of CICR as thimerosal, and promoted calcium-dependent S-glutathionylation of the RyR channel protein. In addition, we tested the effects on CICR of GSSG and of the NO donor NOR-3, as pure S-glutathionylating or S-nitrosylating agents, respectively. The present results suggest that S-glutathionylation modifies specific cysteine residues and, in doing so, either directly or indirectly modulates channel inhibition by Mg2+ whereas S-nitrosylation modifies other cysteines, thereby altering activation by Ca2+. Possible physiological and pathological implications of these findings are discussed. Materials—All reagents used were of analytical grade. Protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin A, benzamidine, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. Calcium Green-2 and Calcium Green-5N were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The redox reagents GSH, GSSG, DTT, and NOR-3 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). When stored, fresh GSH solutions were bubbled with N2 and frozen at –20 °C. To avoid oxidation of GSH, aliquots were thawed only once and the unused portion was discarded. [35S]GSH and [3H]ryanodine were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Primary antibodies against RyR1 (MA3–925) or triadin (MA3–931) and the secondary antibody (SA1–100) were purchased from Affinity BioReagents, Inc. (Golden, CO). Membrane Preparations—Triad-enriched SR vesicles (from now on triads) were isolated from rabbit fast skeletal muscle in the presence of a combination of protease inhibitors, as described previously (53Hidalgo C. Jorquera J. Tapia V. Donoso P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15111-15117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To avoid spontaneous oxidation, all membrane fractions were rapidly frozen and kept under liquid N2. Experiments were performed within 24–48 h of membrane isolation to minimize possible oxidation during storage. Before use, the functionality of each preparation was verified. Native vesicles (0.2 mg/ml) that, following addition of 5 mm Mg-ATP, took longer than 2 min at 25 °C to actively decrease extravesicular free [Ca2+] from 25 μm to <0.2 μm (measured with Calcium Green-2) were discarded. It is possible that, because of the steps taken to avoid oxidation, release rate constants reported in this work for native triads were somewhat lower than previously reported values (20Donoso P. Aracena P. Hidalgo C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 279-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined according to Hartree (54Hartree E.F. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (4541) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. [3H]Ryanodine Binding—[3H]Ryanodine binding to triads was determined essentially as described (55Bull R. Marengo J.J. Suárez-Isla B. Donoso P. Sutko J.L. Hidalgo C. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 749-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The composition of the solution was (in mm): 500 KCl, 0.5 adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate, 20 MOPS-Tris, pH 7.2, pCa 5. Total binding was routinely measured in the presence of 10 nm [3H]ryanodine and nonspecific binding in the additional presence of 10 μm ryanodine. The isolated triad preparations displayed, on average, B max values of ryanodine binding of 18 pmol/mg of protein. Synthesis of GSNO—The synthesis of GSNO was performed as described (56Rossi R. Lusini L. Giannerini F. Giustarini D. Lungarella G. Di Simplicio P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, equimolar quantities of GSH and NaNO2 were incubated in 0.75 n HCl at room temperature. After 5 min of incubation, the solution was neutralized by addition of solid Trizma (Tris base). Concentrations of GSNO were determined from its absorbance, using an extinction coefficient of 767 m–1 cm–1 at 334 nm (44Ji Y. Akerboom T.P. Sies H. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Routinely, yields of GSNO were in the 90–95% range. Synthesis of [35S]GSNO was performed as above, using [35S]GSH at a specific activity of 600 mCi/mmol, after extraction with ethyl acetate of the DTT present in this reagent. Ca2 + Release Kinetics—Ca2+ release kinetics was measured in a SX.18MV fluorescence stopped flow spectrometer from Applied Photophysics Ltd. (Leatherhead, United Kingdom) as described (20Donoso P. Aracena P. Hidalgo C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 279-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 57Sanchez G. Hidalgo C. Donoso P. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2319-2330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Vesicles were actively loaded with Ca2+ before eliciting Ca2+ release. For this purpose triads (1 mg/ml) were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C in a solution containing (in mm): 0.05 CaCl2, 100 KCl, 5 ATP, 5 MgCl2, 10 phosphocreatine plus 15 units/ml creatine kinase, 20 imidazole-MOPS, pH 7.2. Calcium release was initiated by mixing 1 volume of Ca2+-loaded triads with 10 volumes of releasing solution. Releasing solutions were designed to produce after mixing pCa 5 (unless indicated otherwise), 0.6–1.5 mm free [ATP], and variable free [Mg2+], from 25 μm (the lowest value attainable after active loading) to 900 μm. The increase in extravesicular [Ca2+] was determined by measuring the fluorescence of the Ca2+ indicator Calcium Green-5N (20Donoso P. Aracena P. Hidalgo C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 279-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The free [Ca2+], free [Mg2+] and free ATP concentration of releasing solutions were calculated with the WinMaxC program using the constants provided in the file cmc1002e.tcm (www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/winmaxc2.html). To study the effect of SH redox modification on calcium release, kinetics, prior to active loading triads, were incubated with redox agents: GSSG (1 mm for 20 min at 25 °C), GSNO (100 - 500 μm for 20 min at 25 °C), or NOR-3 (50 μm for 10 min at 25 °C). In all cases, control vesicles were incubated in the same conditions. To ensure maximal calcium loading after SH modification, which slowed down Ca2+ uptake rates, the time needed to actively reduce extravesicular free [Ca2+] from 50 μm to <0.2 μm was determined in each case as described in detail elsewhere (57Sanchez G. Hidalgo C. Donoso P. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2319-2330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Identification of RyR1 and Triadin by Western Blot—Protein samples, denatured at 100 °C for 5 min, were separated by SDS-PAGE as detailed below. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with primary antibodies against RyR1 or triadin, diluted 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline. After washing, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline). Protein-antibody reactions were detected with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Radioactive Labeling of SR Proteins with [35S]GSNO—Vesicles were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C with [35S]GSNO (25 μm to 1 mm). The incubation solution contained (in mm): 100 KCl, 20 imidazole-MOPS, pH 7.2, variable free [Ca2+], plus or minus 0.8 mm free [Mg2+]. The amount of CaCl2, EGTA, and MgCl2 needed for a given condition was calculated with the WinMaxC software as above. Incorporation of 35S radioactivity into RyR1 channels was studied either in sucrose gradient fractions enriched in the channel protein or directly following electrophoresis of labeled triads in non-reducing SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels. For sucrose gradient RyR1 channel purification (58Lee H.B. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13305-13312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SR vesicles incubated with [35S]GSNO were sedimented at 45,000 × g for 30 min (4 °C). The resulting pellets were resuspended at 2 mg/ml and incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm imidazole-MOPS, pH 7.2, for 20 min at room temperature under constant stirring, and sedimented at 45,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended at 2 mg/ml in 3 mm EGTA, 20 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 9.0, incubated for 10 min at 4 °C, and sedimented at 45,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. This procedure allows recovery of a fraction enriched in RyR channels, essentially devoid of Ca2+-ATPase and calsequestrin. The RyR1-enriched fraction was resuspended at 1 mg/ml in solubilization buffer solution, containing (in mm): 1000 NaCl, 0.2 CaCl2. 0.1 EGTA, 20 MOPS-Tris, pH 7.2, plus 2% CHAPS and 1% l-α-phosphatidylcholine. This mixture was incubated for 60 min at 25 °C, followed by 60 min at 4 °C, layered onto a 5–20% linear sucrose gradient, and centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 17 h at 4 °C. The sucrose solutions used to generate the gradients were made in solubilization buffer plus 1% CHAPS and 0.5% l-α-phosphatidylcholine. To identify channel-containing fractions, parallel sucrose gradients were run with RyR1 channels solubilized from triads incubated with non-radioactive 4 mm GSNO and 2 nm [3H]ryanodine. Gradient fractions, collected in 1-ml aliquots, were analyzed for protein content (60Feng W. Pessah I.N. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 353: 240-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and for 35S or 3H radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. The protein composition of the fractions was analyzed by electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide-SDS gels under reducing conditions. Alternatively, the 35S radioactivity incorporated into the RyR1 channel protein was determined in RyR1-containing gel fractions separated by electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions. To this purpose, triads incubated with [35S]GSNO were sedimented at 178,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature in a Beckman Airfuge. The resulting pellets were resuspended in non-reducing sample buffer (6 m urea, 1% SDS, 0,02% bromphenol blue, 48 mm NaH2PO4, 170 mm Na2HPO4). Samples, denatured at 100 °C for 5 min, were separated in polyacrylamide gradient gels (3.5–8%) using the Tris-acetate buffer system (Novex NuPAGE®, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Gels, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, were cut in 2-mm slices, the slices were trypsinized, and their radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. Alternatively, gels were dried and phosphorimaging was performed using a Phosphor Screen CP (Eastman Kodak Co.) and the Molecular Imager FX system (Bio-Rad). Screens were scanned, and the images were quantified using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Fast Release Kinetic Measurements—The time course of CICR, measured in the presence of 1.5 mm free ATP, from native and SH-modified triads is illustrated in Fig. 1. In native triads Ca2+ release followed a single exponential time course with an average rate constant((k) value of 11.7 s–1 at <25 μm free [Mg2+] Table I). The experimental record obtained in one preparation that displayed a k value of 11.4 s–1 is illustrated in Fig. 1, panel A. In agreement with previous results (20Donoso P. Aracena P. Hidalgo C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 279-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), increasing free [Mg2+] to 400 μm produced a strong inhibition of CICR (Fig. 1, panel B), decreasing k in this case to 1.6 s–1, with an average value of 1.4 s–1 (Table I). At free [Mg2+] < 25 μm, the same triad preparation incubated with 1 mm GSSG exhibited a k value similar to that for controls, 12 s–1 (Fig. 1, panel C); the average k value was 12.1 s–1 (Table I). However, in 400 μm free [Mg2+], GSSG-treated vesicles had a 3-fold higher k value than control, 4.6 s–1 (Fig. 1, panel D), with an average value of 5.0 s–1 (Table I). At <25 μm free [Mg2+], triads incubated with 100 μm GSNO displayed a higher k value than control vesicles, 17.2 s–1 (Fig. 1, panel E), with an average value of 15.8 s–1 (Table I). In 400 μm free [Mg2+], these same triads also displayed higher k values than controls, 8.2 s–1 (Fig. 1, panel F), with an average k value of 8.9 s–1 (Table I). Incubation with the NO donor NOR-3 produced at <25 μm free [Mg2+] a k value of 21 s–1 (Fig. 1, panel G), with an average value of 25.2 s–1, which is 2-fold higher than control (Table I). However, when release was measured in 400 μm free [Mg+2], triads incubated with NOR-3 displayed a low k value of 1.9 s–1 (Fig. 1, panel H), with an average value of 2.3 s–1 (Table I). These results indicate that, in the incubation conditions used in this work, GSNO and NOR-3, but not GSSG, stimulated CICR when measured at <25 μm free [Mg2+]. These results suggest that GSNO and NOR-3 promoted through S-nitrosylation an increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of CICR. In addition, GSSG and GSNO, but not NOR-3, relieved the strong inhibitory effect on k exerted by Mg+2.Table IEffects of redox agents on calcium release rate constantsConditionRelease rate constant<25 μm [Mg2+]0.4 mm [Mg2+]s-1Control11.7 ± 0.8 (4)1.4 ± 0.2 (4)1 mm GSSG12.1 ± 0.8 (3)5.0 ± 0.6 (3)100 μm GSNO15.8 ± 3.8 (5)8.9 ± 3.0 (5)500 μm GSNO26.9 ± 7.3 (2)aThe error range of only two determinations is given.50 μm NOR-325.2 ± 5.0 (3)2.3 ± 0.6 (3)a The error range of only two determinations is given."

The reaction mechanism of peroxynitrite with oxyhemoglobin that results in the formation of methemoglobin remains to be elucidated. In this work, we studied the reaction under biologically relevant conditions using millimolar oxyhemoglobin concentrations and a stoichiometric excess of oxyhemoglobin over peroxynitrite. The results support a reaction mechanism that involves the net one-electron oxidation of the ferrous heme, isomerization of peroxynitrite to nitrate, and production of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide. Homolytic cleavage of peroxynitrite within the heme iron allows the formation of ferrylhemoglobin in ∼10% yields, which can decay to methemoglobin at the expense of reducing equivalents of the globin moiety. Indeed, spin-trapping studies using 2-methyl-2-nitroso propane and 5,5 dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) demonstrated the formation of tyrosyl- and cysteinyl-derived radicals. DMPO also inhibited covalently linked dimerization products and led to the formation of DMPO-hemoglobin adducts. Hemoglobin nitration was not observed unless an excess of peroxynitrite over oxyhemoglobin was used, in agreement with a marginal formation of nitrogen dioxide.

Souza J.M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)) to yield methemoglobin (metHb) as the final product. Peroxynitrite can behave as either a one- or two-electron oxidant during its direct reaction with transition metal centers; therefore, it is not apparent how metHb is formed. Recently, an initial two-electron oxidation process has been proposed leading to the formation of a high oxidation state intermediate, ferrylhemoglobin (ferrylHb) (8Minetti M. Scorza G. Pietraforte D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2078-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Exner M. Herold S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the ferrylHb intermediate detected during reaction of oxyHb with peroxynitrite has a very short half-life (i.e. milliseconds), and it can only be clearly observed when trapped with sodium sulfide (8Minetti M. Scorza G. Pietraforte D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2078-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Exner M. Herold S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Even under excess of sodium sulfide, the yields of sulfo-hemoglobin obtained were low (∼ 10–15% of metHb yield). This contrasts with the two-electron oxidation product obtained with oxyHb under excess of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which yields a relatively stable ferrylHb intermediate (i.e. minutes) that can be observed directly by spectrophotometric techniques (10Giulivi C. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19453-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).If peroxynitrite oxidizes oxyHb by a two-electron oxidation process, nitrite and molecular oxygen should be produced in addition to ferrylHb (Equation 1): Hb(FeII)O2+ONOOH→Hb(FeIV)=O+O2+NO2-(Eq. 1) Neither nitrite nor molecular oxygen yields have been assessed yet, so the mechanism proposed in Equation 1 cannot be confirmed with the available data. Other authors have previously proposed that reaction of oxyHb with peroxynitrite leads to a rapid one-electron oxidation of the heme iron to the ferric form (11Alayash A.I. Ryan B.A. Cashon R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The latter (11Alayash A.I. Ryan B.A. Cashon R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) reported the appearance of a ferryl-like spectrum toward the end of the reaction period that was proposed to have been caused by concomitant peroxide production as a result of the presence of nitrite in the peroxynitrite preparations.Considering that the observed final product of the reaction is metHb (6Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3566-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 8Minetti M. Scorza G. Pietraforte D.

Ryan B.A. Cashon R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and that the ferryl intermediate is transient and detected at low yields, other reaction mechanisms could be considered that involve the formation of intermediate hemoglobin-NO x complexes, such as those observed during the oxidation of oxyHb by •NO (12Herold S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and probably by •NO and/or NO2- (13Wade R.S. Castro C.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 1382-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the oxyHb-mediated oxidation of •NO, a transient metHb-peroxynitrite complex is detected that rapidly evolves to metHb and nitrate (12Herold S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Hb(FeII)O2+·NO→Hb(FeIII)-OONO→Hb(FeIII)+NO3-(Eq. 2) A similar complex was also proposed for the isomerization of peroxynitrite catalyzed by metmyoglobin or iron-porphyrins (14Bourassa J.L. Ives E.P. Marqueling A.L. Shimanovich R. Groves J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5142-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Jensen M.P. Riley D.P. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 41: 4788-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).The alternative scenarios for the peroxynitrite/oxyHb reaction are further complicated by the fact that the reactions of nitrite (NO2-) and nitrogen dioxide (•NO2) with oxyHb could promote the formation of hydrogen peroxide (13Wade R.S. Castro C.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 1382-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Kosaka H. Imaizumi K. Tyuma I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 702: 237-241Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) which in turn can secondarily react with oxy- and metHb to yield ferrylHb (Equation 3) or ferrylHb with a second oxidation equivalent centered in the globin moiety, respectively (10Giulivi C. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19453-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17McArthur K.M. Davies M.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Hb(FeII)O2+H2O2→Hb(FeIV)=O+O2+H2O(Eq. 3) Regardless of the mechanism considered, a transient ferrylHb is formed during the reaction of peroxynitrite with oxyHb (8Minetti M. Scorza G. Pietraforte D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2078-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Exner M. Herold S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that could be reduced back to metHb by peroxynitrite (Equation 4), nitrite (Equation 5), or globin amino acid residues adjacent to the heme moiety (Equation 6). Hb(FeIV)=O+ONOOH+H+→Hb(FeIII)+·NO+O2+H2O(Eq. 4) Hb(FeIV)=O+NO2-+H+→Hb(FeIII)+·NO2+H2O(Eq. 5) X-Hb(FeIV)=O→·X-Hb(FeIII)+OH-(Eq. 6) The reduction of ferrylHb by peroxynitrite has been proposed (9Exner M. Herold S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but this reaction will only occur under conditions of excess of peroxynitrite with respect to oxyHb. The oxidation of nitrite by ferrylHb can also occur (16Kosaka H. Imaizumi K. Tyuma I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 702: 237-241Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and a kinetic constant for this reaction (7.5 × 102m–1 s–1 at pH 7.0 and 20 °C) was recently reported (19Herold S. Rehmann F.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Finally, it is possible that the oxo-ferryl complex oxidizes amino acid residues, in which case globin-derived radicals should be detected. This latter possibility is in line with previous results obtained with hydrogen peroxide (10Giulivi C. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19453-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanisms by which 1) oxyHb is oxidized, 2) ferrylHb is formed, and 3) ferrylHb is reduced back to metHb still remain to be defined.The reaction of peroxynitrite with oxyHb is relevant in the context of peroxynitrite reactions and diffusion in the intravascular compartment, because red blood cells and oxyHb may constitute a “sink” for intravascularly formed peroxynitrite (7Romero N. Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 720-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 21Minetti M. Pietraforte D. Carbone V. Salzano A.M. Scorza G. Marino G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6689-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Indeed, peroxynitrite can readily cross erythrocyte membranes via anion channel-dependent and simple diffusion mechanisms, and we have previously established that significant amounts of peroxynitrite can reach inside red blood cells, even in the presence of physiological concentrations of carbon dioxide and other fast reacting biotargets of peroxynitrite present in plasma and the extracellular milieu (6Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3566-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 7Romero N. Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 720-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). 3In diffusion experiments using fresh blood (45% hematocrit in heparinized plasma), 20% of extracellularly added peroxynitrite could reach the inside of red blood cells and oxidize oxyHb (N. Romero, A. Denicola, and R. Radi, unpublished results).3In diffusion experiments using fresh blood (45% hematocrit in heparinized plasma), 20% of extracellularly added peroxynitrite could reach the inside of red blood cells and oxidize oxyHb (N. Romero, A. Denicola, and R. Radi, unpublished results). Thus, the diffusion of peroxynitrite to red blood cells competes with other routes of peroxynitrite consumption in the intravascular space. Importantly, once in the erythrocyte, the large concentration of hemoglobin (20 mm heme), together with a relatively high rate constant (for a comparison of rate constants of peroxynitrite with biotargets, see Ref. 4Radi R. Denicola A. Alvarez B. Ferrer-Sueta G. Rubbo H. Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathobiology. Academic Press, New York.2000: 57-82Crossref Google Scholar), results in a rapid and almost complete intraerythrocytic consumption of peroxynitrite (7Romero N. Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It is important to notice that the reaction of peroxynitrite with intracellular oxyHb (20 mm heme, k = 2 × 104m–1 s–1) is five to six times faster than that with CO2 (1.3 mm, k = 4.6 × 104m–1 s–1) at 37 °C, which implies that more than 80% of the peroxynitrite inside red blood cells will react directly with hemoglobin and supports the importance of studying this reaction.In addition to oxidation reactions, peroxynitrite also promotes the nitration of aromatic compounds such as protein tyrosine residues, a process that requires the intermediate formation of secondary nitrating species. The overall process involves free radical mechanisms in which one-electron oxidants derived from peroxynitrite attack the phenolic ring, leading to formation of a tyrosyl radical, followed by a coupling of the amino acid-derived radical with •NO2 to yield 3-nitrotyrosine (22Radi R. Peluffo G. Alvarez M.N. Naviliat M. Cayota A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 463-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Yields of nitration by peroxynitrite can be significantly enhanced by ferric iron complexes, which reduce peroxynitrite by one electron, resulting in the formation of •NO2 and an oxo-iron complex that could then act as the one-electron oxidant to the phenolic ring. Another iron-dependent nitration mechanism is the one catalyzed by peroxidases, in which ferric heme promotes an initial two-electron reduction of peroxynitrite to yield peroxidase complex I and NO2- (23Sampson J.B. Ye Y. Rosen H. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Complex I can then react quickly with NO2- to generate •NO2 and compound II (24Burner U. Furtmuller P.G. Kettle A.J. Koppenol W.H. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20597-20601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), both of which can participate in sequential steps that lead to nitration. According to these considerations, the coexistence of significant amounts of ferrylHb and •NO2 could promote tyrosine nitration as well (6Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3566-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar).The kinetics of peroxynitrite decomposition and secondary reactions is largely influenced by target concentration (4Radi R. Denicola A. Alvarez B. Ferrer-Sueta G. Rubbo H. Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathobiology. Academic Press, New York.2000: 57-82Crossref Google Scholar). Under biologically relevant conditions, oxyHb will be present in large excess over peroxynitrite, a condition that may not always be accomplished when performing mechanistic experiments in vitro. Thus, in this article, we investigate the reaction of peroxynitrite with pure human oxyHb and define the mechanisms that lead to the formation of metHb under experimental conditions that are relevant to the biological chemistry of this reaction in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals—The following reagents were purchased from Sigma: sulfanilamide, N-(1naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (PHPA), luminol (5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione), p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, 2-methyl-2-nitroso propane (MNP), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and Pronase. Vanadium (III) chloride was from Aldrich; hydrogen peroxide was from Fluka; 5,5 dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was from Alexis; and the anion exchanger DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B was obtained from Pharmacia. Perdeuterated MNP (MNP-d9) was kindly provided by Dr. B. Kalyanaraman (Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI). All other reagents were of research grade quality. Peroxynitrite was synthesized from hydrogen peroxide and nitrous acid as described previously (25Denicola A. Freeman B.A. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 26Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Contaminating hydrogen peroxide was eliminated with manganese dioxide, and peroxynitrite concentration was determined at 302 nm (ϵ302 = 1.67 mm–1 cm–1). The concentration of nitrite in the peroxynitrite preparations was determined by the Griess method (28Schmidt H.H.W. Kelm M. Feelisch M. Stamler J. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. Wiley, New York1996: 491-498Google Scholar) using peroxynitrite previously decomposed under acidic conditions (200 mm KH2PO4) that undergoes completely isomerization to nitrate (4Radi R. Denicola A. Alvarez B. Ferrer-Sueta G. Rubbo H. Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathobiology. Academic Press, New York.2000: 57-82Crossref Google Scholar). Nitrite contamination was typically less than 30% of the peroxynitrite concentration. The absence of hydrogen peroxide was confirmed by decomposing peroxynitrite in buffer before the assay with horseradish peroxide plus iodide as the second substrate (ϵ353 = 25,000 m–1 cm–1; Ref. 29Cotton M.L. Dunford H.B. Can. J. Chem. 1973; 51: 582-587Crossref Google Scholar). For all experimental conditions, control runs were performed with peroxynitrite previously decomposed in buffer (reverse order addition experiments). These controls allow discounting the contribution of contaminants of the peroxynitrite preparation and decomposition products in the observed results.Preparation of Human Oxyhemoglobin—OxyHb was prepared from human erythrocytes (RBC) as described previously (30Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were obtained by centrifugation (800 × g for 10 min) of freshly drawn blood from a healthy donor with heparin as anticoagulant. After the RBC had been washed with 0.15 m NaCl, lysis was achieved by diluting with 3 volumes of distilled water. After 15 min at room temperature, the lysate was centrifuged and the supernatant was diluted in 0.2 volumes of 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 0.5 mm EDTA. The lysate was then loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (2.5 × 20 cm) previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 0.1 mm EDTA. OxyHb was eluted, applying a pH gradient from 8.3 to 7.0 in the same buffer. The purity of the preparations was assessed by SDS/15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with silver staining, yielding a single protein band around 15.5 kDa, corresponding to the α and β chains of human hemoglobin. The solution of hemoglobin obtained was more than 95% oxyHb and neither superoxide dismutase (31Flohe L. Otting F. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) nor catalase (32Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (18107) Google Scholar) was detected. FerrylHb was prepared from oxyHb (100 μm in 100 mm phosphate buffer and 0.1 mm DTPA, pH 7.4) by addition of a 5-fold excess of hydrogen peroxide at room temperature. Conversion of oxyHb to ferrylHb was followed spectrophotometrically. After 5 min, catalase was added to eliminate hydrogen peroxide excess and ferrylHb was used immediately.Concentration of Hemoglobin—The concentration of oxy- and metHb was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 577 and 630 nm as described by Winterbourn (30Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar): oxyHb (concentration of heme, μm) = 66 A577 – 80 A630; metHb (concentration of heme, μm) = 279 A630 – 3 A577. In the experiments where ferrylHb was also present in the samples, the concentration of each of the three species (concentration of heme, μm) was determined by measuring the absorbance at 560, 577 and 630 nm and using the following equations derived from the corresponding molar extinction coefficients of each species (30Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar): oxyHb = –1.5 A 560 + 68 A 577 – 82 A 630; metHb = –79 A 560 + 42 A 577 + 319 A 630; ferrylHb = 96 A 560 – 55 A 577 – 47 A 630. Absorption spectra were collected on a Shimadzu 2100 spectrophotometer.Modification of Cysteine Residues—β-93 Cys residues were blocked by incubating hemoglobin with 10-fold excess of NEM for 1 h at room temperature and then passed through a Sephadex G-25 column. The amount of total sulfhydryls was quantified before and after treatment by spectrophotometric titration with p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (33Torchinsky Y.M. Sulfur in Proteins. Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK1981Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of 5–10 μl of 1 mm p-chloromercuribenzoic acid were added to 1 ml of hemoglobin solutions (20–30 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 1.0% SDS, and the increase in the absorbance at 250 nm was determined. The presence of SDS assured measurement of the total number of thiols present in the molecule. Generally, six thiols/hemoglobin (tetramer) were quantified after hemoglobin purification and four thiols/hemoglobin after treatment with NEM.Determination of Nitrite and Nitrate—Determination of nitrite was performed by the Griess method (28Schmidt H.H.W. Kelm M. Feelisch M. Stamler J. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. Wiley, New York1996: 491-498Google Scholar). To determine total nitrate plus nitrite (NOx-), a solution of vanadium (III) chloride (25 mm, final concentration) was added to the Griess reagents to reduce nitrate to nitrite as described previously (34Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Wink D.A. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (2655) Google Scholar). To avoid secondary reactions during NOx- determination, hemoglobin was previously separated by gel filtration. Immediately after each treatment, 100 μl of the samples were passed through a Hi-Trap Desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted using 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, at a flow rate of 5.0 ml/min. After injection of the sample, the fractions that eluted between 20–40 s (hemoglobin) and 50–70 s (total NOx-) were collected for further analysis. Control experiments were performed to assure that under our experimental conditions, the reaction of oxyHb with nitrite present in peroxynitrite preparations does not occur; i.e. all nitrite was recovered and no metHb was observed after sample separation. Dilution of the samples after passage through the column was nearly 20-fold, and it was checked in every experiment with appropriate standard solutions.Oxymetry Studies—Oxygen evolution studies were performed polarographically using a Cole Parmer oximeter with a Clark type electrode (YSI model 5300). Reactions were performed at 37 °C.Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide as a Reaction Product—Hydrogen peroxide was detected by chemiluminescence with luminol using an assay based on the pseudo-peroxidase activity of hemoglobin (35Nohl H. Stolze K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This method was the most appropriate because of its sensitivity and because it overcomes the loss of H2O2 from reactions with oxy- and metHb that occurs during the sample processing that other techniques would require. Briefly, peroxynitrite (250 and 500 μm) was added to oxyHb (1.0 mm) in 100 mm phosphate buffer, and 0.1 mm DTPA, pH 7.3; immediately after, 100 μl of the sample was placed in a tube containing 3.0 ml of luminol (10 μm) in 200 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, and 0.3 mm DTPA. Chemiluminescence was monitored using a Thorn-Emi photon counter equipped with an EMI Fact 50 MK III Photomultiplier cooled to –20 °C (36Castro L. Alvarez M.N. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The voltage in the photomultiplier was kept at 1350 V. The reactions were always carried out in glass tubes that were kept at 25 °C by a temperature-controlled water bath.EPR Experiments—The EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature (25 °C) on a Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer. The reaction mixtures (200 μl, final volume) were transferred to 100-μl flat cells immediately after peroxynitrite addition and the spectra recorded within 1 min. The magnetic field was calibrated with 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy radical (g = 2.0056). MNP stock solution (1.0 m, monomer) was prepared in acetonitrile (high pressure liquid chromatography quality). The MNP-Hb radical concentration was estimated by using a 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy radical standard (145 μm) in 50% glycerin. The calibration experiments were performed by using a fingertip Dewar flask containing liquid nitrogen.SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—All experiments were carried out at 25 °C unless otherwise indicated. To rule out any contribution of nitrite present in peroxynitrite preparations, samples were passed through Sephadex-G25 immediately after treatment and then stored at 4 °C until preparation for electrophoresis. Reaction mixtures containing human hemoglobin samples were separated on 15% polyacrylamide gels using SDS-PAGE. The gels were either silver-stained for protein band visualization or electrophoretically transferred (100 V, 1 h) to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C extra; Amersham Biosciences) for Western blot analysis.Protein bands transferred to nitrocellulose membranes were stained and fixed using non-permanent 2% Ponceau S in 30% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min, scanned, and then destained overnight with deionized water. Immunodetection of DMPO nitrone adducts on the hemoglobin was measured using a recently developed anti-DMPO nitrone antiserum, which binds to the one-electron oxidation product of the initial DMPO nitroxyl spin adducts (37Detweiler C.D. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Chignell C.F. Germolec D. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For DMPO nitrone adduct analysis, destained nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 90 min in blocking solution (2.5% bovine serum albumin, 2.5% non-fat milk in 50 mm Tris buffered saline). The membranes were washed for 2 min in wash buffer (0.05% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% non-fat milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in 50 mm Tris-buffered saline), then incubated for 90 min with the primary rabbit antiserum anti-DMPO nitrone diluted 1:5000 in wash buffer (37Detweiler C.D. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Chignell C.F. Germolec D. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). After extensive washing in the same buffer, the membranes were incubated 60 min with the secondary antibody, anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL), diluted 1:5000 in wash buffer. After a second series of wash steps, to remove the unbound secondary antibody, immunoreactive proteins were detected using the Immun-Star Chemiluminescent Kit (Bio-Rad) following the commercial protocol.The immunochemical detection of protein nitrotyrosine was carried out with a highly specific polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody develop"

Co-expression of the α1b-adrenoreceptor with a fusion protein incorporating the N-terminal domain and transmembrane helix 1 of the α1b-adrenoreceptor and G11α did not result in agonist activation of the G protein but did indicate a role for transmembrane helix 1 in dimerization.

These data demonstrate that dimers of these class A receptors function via trans-activation of associated G proteins. The concept that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; TM, transmembrane; tr-FRET, time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein. exist as dimers or higher order oligomers has moved rapidly from hypothesis to being widely accepted (1Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 2Devi L.A. Trends Pharmacol.

Lee S.P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 808-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). A range of approaches has contributed to this understanding. This includes the ability to co-immunoprecipitate differentially epitope-tagged forms of a GPCR from cells in which they are co-expressed, and, in intact cells, the application of a number of resonance energy transfer-based techniques. However, the role of dimerization in function and the mechanisms then responsible for initiation of signal transduction by the dimer have been more recalcitrant to analysis. Significant progress in this area has recently been achieved for the class C GPCRs. These contain both a long extracellular N-terminal domain, to which agonist ligands bind, and the prototypic seven transmembrane (TM) helix bundle architecture that is the common feature of all GPCR families (for review, see Ref. 5Parmentier M.L. Prezeau L. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 268-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The functional γ-aminobutyric acid, type b receptor is a hetero-dimer of two distinct gene products in which trafficking to the plasma membrane requires interaction between the partner polypeptides (6White J.H.

This is also true for the class A rhodopsin-like GPCRs because non-functional, truncated splice variants can restrict plasma membrane delivery of full-length GPCRs and, thus, limit their function (10Grosse R. Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 11Lee S.P. O'Dowd B.F. Ng G.Y.K. Varghese G. Akil H. Mansour A. Nguyen T.

Chimeric class C GPCRs consisting of the extracellular domain of one GPCR and the TM and intracellular elements of a second, closely related GPCR or in which the intracellular loops of dimer partners are exchanged have provided strong evidence that the mechanism of action of the dimer involves trans-activation (13Duthey B.

Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14649-14654Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); that is, ligand binding to one element of the dimer results in activation of G protein produced by the other GPCR within the dimer. Again, the γ-aminobutyric acid, type b receptor has been particularly informative in this regard as only one of the two gene products that forms the dimer is able to bind the agonist γ-aminobutyric acid. Equivalent systems are not available for the majority of class A GPCRs. However, for the luteinizing hormone receptor, which also has a long N-terminal domain that binds the ligand, partial reconstitution of function has been achieved by co-expression of distinct pairs of mutants (15Osuga Y.

Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in recent studies co-expression of a mutant receptor defective in hormone binding and another mutant defective in signal generation rescued hormone-activated cAMP production (17Lee C. Ji I. Ryu K. Song Y. Conn P.M. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15795-15800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins in which G protein α subunits are linked in-frame to the C terminus of a GPCR have become widely used tools to study the details of information transfer between these proteins (18Milligan G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 19Milligan G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because these can be considered as bi-functional proteins containing the sequence and function of both GPCR and G protein they can be utilized to generate contrasting pairs of non-functional mutants. Herein we generate and analyze fusion proteins incorporating either wild type GPCRs or mutants unable to activate G proteins and wild type or mutant G proteins unable to be activated by GPCRs. We show that co-expression of pairs of these non-functional mutant fusion proteins is complementary and results in the generation of functional dimers. This reconstitution can be both easily quantitated in membrane preparations and monitored in single intact cells. Studies of hetero-dimeric GPCR pairs support a mechanism in which agonists at aminergic class A GPCRs mediate trans-activation of the GPCR-associated G proteins.

All materials for tissue culture were supplied by Invitrogen. [3H]Prazosin (80 Ci/mmol), [3H]mepyramine (20 Ci/mmol), and [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Cruachem (Glasgow, Strathclyde, UK). Reagents for time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (tr-FRET) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Receptor ligands were purchased from RBI (Gillingham, Kent, UK). Production and characterization of the anti-Gq/G11 antiserum CQ was described by Mitchell et al. (25Mitchell F.M. Buckley N.J. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were from Sigma and were of the highest grade available. Construction of Fusion Proteins—Production and subcloning of wild type and mutated α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion proteins was performed as described in Carrillo et al. (26Carrillo J.J. Stevens P.A. Milligan G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1080-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Production and subcloning of the human histamine H1 receptor-G11α fusion proteins was performed in two separate stages. In the first step, using the N-terminal primer 5′-GATACTGGGCTATCCAAGCTTATGAGCCTCCCCAATTCCTC-3′, a HindIII restriction site (underlined) was introduced by PCR upstream of the coding sequence of the human histamine H1 receptor. Using a C-terminal primer 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCTGGAGCGAATATGCAGAATTCTCT-3′, a three amino acid spacer (Ser-Gly-Arg) and a NotI restriction site were introduced immediately upstream of the stop codon. Similarly, the mouse G11α sequence was amplified by PCR using the N-terminal primer 5′-AAGGAAAAAAGCGGCCGCATGACTCTGGAGTCCATGATGGC-3′ and the C-terminal primer 5′-ATGAAACCGCTCGAGTCACACCAGGTTGTACTCCTTCAG-3′. This introduced NotI and XhoI restriction sites flanking the G11α-coding sequence. In the second step, the amplified receptor fragment was digested with HindIII/NotI, and the G11α fragment was digested with NotI/XhoI. These fragments were purified and ligated into pcDNA 3 vector (Invitrogen) previously digested with HindIII/XhoI. The choice of intracellular loop 2 Leu to Asp mutants was based on the studies of Greasley et al. (27Greasley P.J. Fanelli F. Scheer A. Abuin L. Nenniger-Tosato M. DeBenedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46485-46494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation and tr-FRET studies, c-Myc (EQKLISEEDL) or FLAG (DYKDDDDK) epitopes were introduced immediately after the N-terminal methionine. Each construct was fully sequenced before its expression and analysis. Construction of the c-Myc-NtTM1α1b-G11α fusion protein was also carried out in two stages. Using the N-terminal primer 5′-TTTCCCAAGCTTATGGAACAAAAACTTATTTCTGAAGAAGATCTGAATCCCGATCTGGACACC-3′ a HindIII restriction site (underlined) followed by an ATG codon and the c-Myc tag sequence (italics) was introduced by PCR upstream of the coding sequence of the α1b-adrenoreceptor. Using a C-terminal primer 5′-AATCGGGGTACCGGTGGGCGTCCGCAGGTGCCGAAT-3′, a two-amino acid spacer (Lys-Leu) and a KpnI restriction site (underlined) were introduced immediately after the codon for the 80th amino acid of the hamster α1b-adrenoreceptor. In the second stage the resulting PCR fragment was digested with HindIII/KpnI. Next, the α1b-adrenoreceptor element of the α1b-adrenoreceptor-G11α fusion protein was removed by digestion with HindIII/KpnI, and the digested PCR fragment was ligated into the resulting vector. Thus, the generated fusion protein contained a c-Myc tag linked in-frame with the first 80 amino acids of the α1b adrenoreceptor and G11α. Transient Transfection of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.292 g/liter l-glutamine and 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. Cells were grown to 60-80% confluency before transient transfection in 60-mm dishes. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. [35S]GTPγS Binding—[35S]GTPγS binding experiments were initiated by the addition of membranes containing defined amounts of the fusion constructs (see “Results” for details) to an assay buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 μm guanosine 5′-diphosphate, 0.2 mm ascorbic acid, 50 nCi of [35S]GTPγS) containing the indicated concentrations of receptor ligands. Nonspecific binding was determined in the same conditions but in the presence of 100 μm GTPγS. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and were terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. The samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in solubilization buffer (100 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.25% Nonidet P-40) plus 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Samples were pre-cleared with Pansorbin (Calbiochem) followed by immunoprecipitation with CQ antiserum (25Mitchell F.M. Buckley N.J. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Finally, the immunocomplexes were washed twice with solubilization buffer, and bound [35S]GTPγS was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. [3H]Ligand Binding Studies—[3H]Prazosin binding studies, monitoring expression of the α1b-adrenoreceptor-containing constructs, were performed as in Carrillo et al. (26Carrillo J.J. Stevens P.A. Milligan G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1080-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). [3H]Mepyramine binding assays, monitoring expression of the histamine H1 receptor-containing constructs were initiated by the addition of 8 μg of cell membranes to an assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4) containing [3H]mepyramine (0.1-10 nm). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm triprolidine. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C, and bound ligand was separated from free ligand by vacuum filtration through GF/B filters. The filters were washed twice with assay buffer, and bound ligand was estimated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. [Ca2+]i Imaging—EF88 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and l-glutamine (1 mm) in a 95% air and 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. A portion of the cells harvested during trypsinization were plated onto glass coverslips, and after a 24-h growth period they were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 3 h cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM I and then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium growth medium for a further 24 h. A total of 3 μg of pCDNA3 containing the relevant cDNA species was used to transfect each coverslip. Transfected EF88 cells were loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fura-2 by incubation (15-20 min, 37 °C) under reduced light in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's growth medium containing the dye's membrane-permeant acetoxymethyl ester form (1.5 μm). Details of the imaging studies and their analysis have been provided previously (28Liu S. Carrillo J.J. Pediani J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25707-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). GPCR Co-immunoprecipitation Studies—Co-immunoprecipitation studies using FLAG- and c-Myc-tagged forms of the α1b-adrenoreceptor and histamine H1 receptor constructs were performed as in McVey et al. (29McVey M. Ramsay D. Kellett E. Rees S. Wilson S. Pope A.J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14092-14099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and Ramsay et al. (30Ramsay D. Kellett E. McVey M. Rees S. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the studies with the histamine H1 receptor, 30 units/ml of endoglycosidase F were added. Time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer was performed on intact HEK293 cells using Eu3+-labeled anti-c-Myc antibodies and allophycocyanin-labeled anti-FLAG antibodies as described in McVey et al. (29McVey M. Ramsay D. Kellett E. Rees S. Wilson S. Pope A.J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14092-14099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Miscellaneous—All experiments were performed on at least three independent occasions. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. We have previously generated a fusion protein between the α1b-adrenoreceptor and the α subunit of G11 that binds both agonist and antagonist ligands including [3H]prazosin (26Carrillo J.J. Stevens P.A. Milligan G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1080-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The addition of the agonist phenylephrine to membranes of HEK293 cells transfected to express this construct resulted in a large stimulation of the binding of [35S]GTPγS, monitored after the assay by immunoprecipitation using an antiserum against the C-terminal decapeptide of G11α (Fig. 1A). Introduction of a G208AG11α mutant into the fusion protein essentially eliminated phenylephrine stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding when membranes expressing equal amounts of this construct were used (Fig. 1A), because this form of the G protein is unable to release bound GDP. However, this mutation did not alter the binding properties of either [3H]prazosin or phenylephrine (Fig. 1, B and C, Table I). Previous studies show that mutation of hydrophobic amino acids in intracellular loop 2 of the α1b-adrenoreceptor can eliminate agonist-mediated signal transduction (27Greasley P.J. Fanelli F. Scheer A. Abuin L. Nenniger-Tosato M. DeBenedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46485-46494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We, thus, generated a fusion protein between L151D α1b-adrenoreceptor and G11α. This also bound both [3H]prazosin and phenylephrine as the wild type fusion protein (Fig. 1, B and C, Table I), but phenylephrine was again unable to stimulate binding of [35S]GTPγS (Fig. 1A). Co-expression of the two non-functional mutants reconstituted phenylephrine-mediated binding of [35S]GTPγS (Fig. 1A), and when the membrane amounts employed contained twice as many [3H]prazosin binding sites as used for each individual construct, the level of agonist-mediated [35S]GTPγS was ∼70% as great as when employing the wild type fusion construct (Fig. 1A). Reconstitution of function required co-expression of the two mutant fusions. When the two constructs were expressed in separate cell populations and either the cells were mixed before membrane preparation or membranes were prepared individually and then combined before assay, no agonist-stimulated binding of [35S]GTPγS was observed (Fig. 1D). Such results are consistent with the hypothesis that GPCR dimerization is required for agonist function. Furthermore, within the dimer, one GPCR element must activate the G protein physically linked to the partner GPCR. To extend this concept an equivalent set of experiments was performed using fusions between the histamine H1 receptor and G11α. The basic results were the same. The fusion containing wild type forms of both the GPCR and G protein produced a large stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding in the presence of the agonist histamine (Fig. 2). This was absent upon separate expression of either a histamine H1 receptor-G208AG11α fusion protein or a fusion between L133D histamine H1 receptor and wild type G11α. Co-expression of these two mutants reconstituted agonist activation of the G protein (Fig. 2). Again, after co-expression of the two mutants, membranes expressing a 2-fold higher number of 3H-labeled antagonist binding sites produced nearly as high a level of [35S]GTPγS binding upon the addition of histamine as the wild type histamine H1 receptor-G11α fusion protein expressed in isolation.Table IThe binding affinity of agonist and antagonists ligands to α1b-adrenoceptor- and histamine H1 receptor-G11α fusion proteins is unaffected by the addition of N-terminal epitope tags or the introduction of specific mutations.

To do so we employed Ca2+ imaging using EF88 cells. These are a line of mouse embryo fibroblasts that derive from a Gqα/G11α double knock-out mouse (20Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Simon M.I. Wu D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 15745-15750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). They, thus, require expression of both a functional GPCR and a functional Ca2+-mobilizing G protein to produce elevation of intracellular [Ca2+] (28Liu S. Carrillo J.J. Pediani J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25707-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31Stevens P.A. Pediani J. Carrillo J.J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35883-35890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Upon introduction of fusions between wild type forms of either the histamine H1 receptor or the α1b-adrenoreceptor, and G11α appropriate agonists produced elevation of intracellular [Ca2+] (Fig. 3). This occurred only in positively transfected cells. Because EF88 cells are recalcitrant to transfection, we co-transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) to allow visualization of the positively transfected cells. Only those cells that were positive for GFP responded to agonist ligands (Fig. 3A). For both the histamine H1 receptor and the α1b-adrenoreceptor the fusions containing either the non-agonist-responsive GPCR or the G protein mutant failed to elevate intracellular [Ca2+] (Fig. 3, B and C). However, co-expression of the pairs of complementary fusions again resulted in effective signal generation (Fig. 3, B and C). We also wished to demonstrate directly the ability of both the isolated GPCRs and the GPCR-G protein fusions to form dimers. Constructs were N-terminally epitope-tagged with either the c-Myc or FLAG tags. After co-expression in HEK293 cells of both tagged forms of the α1b-adrenoreceptor, but not their separate expression, followed by cell mixing, immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies resulted in the presence of anti-c-Myc immunoreactivity in the precipitate (Fig. 4A). SDS-PAGE demonstrated the presence of bands identified by the c-Myc antibody of apparent size 53 and 110 kDa, consistent with monomeric and dimeric forms of the α1b-adrenoreceptor. Anti-c-Myc immunoreactivity was also observed near the top of the gel, and this may represent either a higher order oligomer or aggregated protein (Fig. 4A). When equivalent experiments were performed with the α1b-adrenoreceptor-G11α fusion protein similar results were obtained except that the anti-c-Myc-reactive bands were now of apparent mass 95 and 190kDa, consistent with the anticipated size of monomeric and dimeric forms of this fusion protein (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained for FLAG- and c-Myc-tagged forms of the histamine H1 receptor (Fig. 4B). The monomeric form of the isolated receptor migrated as a ∼50-kDa polypeptide with the dimeric form migrating as anticipated for a polypeptide of some 100 kDa (Fig. 4B). Again, as with the α1b-adrenoreceptor, a series of higher molecular mass species were also detected. When using the histamine H1 receptor-G11α fusion protein both the monomeric and dimeric species were also easily detected (Fig. 4B). A series of issues have been raised about the meaning and validity of GPCR dimerization data that rely exclusively on co-immunoprecipitation (3Milligan G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1265-1271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Salim K. Fenton T. Bacha J. Urien-Rodriguez H. Bonnert T. Skynner H.A. Watts E. Kerby J. Heald A. Beer M. McAllister G. Guest P.C. J.

We, thus, monitored dimerization of both the isolated α1b-adrenoreceptor and the α1b-adrenoreceptor-G11α fusion protein in intact HEK293 cells using tr-FRET. When co-expressing c-Myc- and FLAG-tagged forms of either the isolated GPCR or the fusion protein, a clear energy transfer signal was obtained in intact cells upon the addition of a combination of Eu3+-labeled anti-c-Myc antibodies as energy donor and allophycocyanin-labeled anti-FLAG antibodies as energy acceptor (Fig. 5A). An energy transfer signal was not obtained when the tagged forms of the GPCR constructs were expressed in separate populations of cells that were mixed before the addition of the antibodies. Equivalent results were obtained in HEK293 cells expressing N-terminal c-Myc- and FLAG-tagged forms of both the histamine H1 receptor and the histamine H1 receptor-G11α fusion protein (Fig. 5B). To examine the possibility of hetero-dimerization between the histamine H1 receptor and the α1b-adrenoreceptor and the mechanism of G protein activation by GPCR dimers we co-expressed a FLAG-tagged form of the histamine H1 receptor and the c-Myc-tagged form of the α1b-adrenoreceptor. After immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies and SDS-PAGE, c-Myc immunoreactivity was detected in polypeptides of apparent molecular mass 50 and 100 kDa, consistent with the immunoprecipitation of histamine H1 receptor-α1b-adrenoreceptor hetero-dimers that are only partially separated by the electrophoresis conditions employed (Fig. 6A). tr-FRET studies afte"

Because this mevalonate pathway also produces several non-sterol isoprenoid compounds, the level of HMG-CoA reductase activity may coordinate many cellular processes and functions. We used gene targeting to knock out the mouse HMG-CoA reductase gene. The heterozygous mutant mice (Hmgcr+/–) appeared normal in their development and gross anatomy and were fertile. Although HMG-CoA reductase activities were reduced in Hmgcr+/– embryonic fibroblasts, the enzyme activities and cholesterol biosynthesis remained unaffected in the liver from Hmgcr+/– mice, suggesting that the haploid amount of Hmgcr gene is not rate-limiting in the hepatic cholesterol homeostasis. Consistently, plasma lipoprotein profiles were similar between Hmgcr+/– and Hmgcr+/+ mice. In contrast, the embryos homozygous for the Hmgcr mutant allele were recovered at the blastocyst stage, but not at E8.5, indicating that HMG-CoA reductase is crucial for early development of the mouse embryos. The lethal phenotype was not completely rescued by supplementing the dams with mevalonate. Although it has been postulated that a second, peroxisome-specific HMG-CoA reductase could substitute for the ER reductase in vitro, we speculate that the putative peroxisomal reductase gene, if existed, does not fully compensate for the lack of the ER enzyme at least in embryogenesis.

The mevalonate pathway produces isoprenoids that are essential for diverse cellular functions, ranging from cholesterol synthesis to growth control.

Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4519) Google Scholar). Because of its major role in cholesterol biosynthesis, the regulation of HMG-CoA reductase has been intensely studied. To ensure a steady mevalonate supply, the non-sterol and sterol end-products of mevalonate metabolism exert feedback regulation on the activity of this enzyme through multivalent mechanisms, including inhibition of transcription of the HMG-CoA reductase mRNA, blocking of translation, and acceleration of protein degradation, thus regulating the amount of reductase protein over a several hundred-fold range (reviewed in Refs. 1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4519) Google Scholar, 2Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, statins, are potent hypocholesterolemic agents that exhibit some cholesterol-independent, or so-called pleiotropic, effects, that involve improving or restoring endothelial function, enhancing the stability of atherosclerotic plaque, and decreasing oxidative stress and vascular inflammation (4Takemoto M. Liao J.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1712-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Benefits of statins also extend beyond cardiovascular diseases, including a reduction in the risk of dementia (5Jick H. Zornberg G.L. Jick S.S. Seshadri S. Drachman D.A.

Most of these pleiotropic effects of statins are shown to be mediated by their ability to block the synthesis of non-sterol isoprenoid intermediates. However, it remains to be unraveled how the mevalonate pathway is affected in those disease processes, particularly in cells involved in atherogenesis. In addition, some of the collateral effects of statins have been found to be independent of HMG-CoA reductase (10Rao S. Porter D.C. Chen X. Herliczek T. Lowe M. Keyomarsi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 11Weitz-Schmidt G. Welzenbach K. Brinkmann V. Kamata T. Kallen J. Bruns C. Cottens S. Takada Y. Hommel U. Nat.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1784-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In mammals, only one gene has been found to encode HMG-CoA reductase (13Reynolds G.A. Basu S.K. Osborne T.F. Chin D.J. Gil G. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L. Cell. 1984; 38: 275-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In yeast, fungi, and plants, on the other hand, more than one gene encode the enzyme. Yeast, for example, contains two functional genes for HMG-CoA reductase, HMG-CoA reductase 1 (HMG1) and HMG2. HMG1 and HMG2 are differently expressed, and, when HMG1 is deleted, HMG2 can replace the function of HMG1 (14Basson M.E. Thorsness M. Rine J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5563-5567Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Given the major role of HMG-CoA reductase in the mevalonate pathway, it is tempting to hypothesize that mammalian cells also have a second gene for the enzyme. In fact, although the classic form of the enzyme is a transmembrane protein anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), recent studies using a mutant cell line that lacks the ER isoform of the enzyme indicate the existence of a second isoform of the reductase exclusively localized in peroxisomes and that the peroxisomal activity might be due to a second gene (15Engfelt W.H. Shackelford J.E. Aboushadi N. Jessani N. Masuda K. Paton V.G. Keller G.A. Krisans S.K. J. Biol.

We have previously shown that the targeted disruption of the gene for squalene synthase, the first committed enzyme of sterol synthesis, results in embryonic death at mid gestation with growth retardation and defective neural tube closure (18Tozawa R. Ishibashi S. Osuga J. Yagyu H. Oka T. Chen Z. Ohashi K. Perrey S. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Harada K. Gotoda T. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Biol.

In these mice, the non-sterol pathways are presumed to be retained, whereas de novo cholesterol synthesis is blocked. To further determine the physiological consequences of perturbation of the mevalonate pathway and gain some insights into a putative second gene for HMG-CoA reductase, we have generated and characterized mice defective in mevalonate synthesis by disrupting the gene for HMG-CoA reductase. Generation of HMG-CoA Reductase Knockout Mice—A replacement-type targeting vector was constructed; the 0.8-kb short arm spanning exons 14–15, and the 10-kb long arm fragment encompassing exons 2–12 were generated by PCR using genomic DNA from the 129/Sv mouse as template. Primers used were as follows: 5′-CCGCTCGAGAAAGGAGGCCTTTGATAGCACCAGCA-3′ (exon 14) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTTAGAGATCATGTTCATGCCCATGG-3′ (exon 15) for the short arm and 5′-GCGGCCGCTTTGTGGCCTCCCATCCCTGGGAAGTTATTGT-3′ (exon 2) and 5′-GCGGCCGCCTCTGCATCGCTAAGGAACTTTGCACCTTTCT-3′ (exon 12) for the long arm. Integrity of the amplified fragments was verified by Southern blot analysis and partial sequencing. After subcloning into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), the fragments were cut out and inserted into the XhoI and NotI sites, respectively, of the pPolII-short-neo-bpA-HSVTK as described previously (19Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Thus, a 1.2-kb region spanning the exons 12–14 of the HMG-CoA reductase gene was replaced by a neomycin-resistant cassette, which was expected to abolish translation of the entire carboxyl half of the protein containing the catalytic activity (20Liscum L. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 522-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After linearization by digestion with SalI, the vector was electroporated into JH1 embryonic stem cells (A gift from Dr. J. Herz at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas). Targeted clones, which had been selected in the presence of G418 and 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil, were identified by PCR using the following primers: primer 1, 5′-GATTGGGAAGACAATAGCAGGCATGC-3′ and primer 2, 5′-GCTGGGTACGGTAGCACAGTTATGGT-3′ (Fig. 1). Homologous recombination was verified by Southern blot analysis after EcoRI digestion using a 3′-flanking probe (Fig. 1). Targeted embryonic stem cell clones were injected into the C57BL/6J blastocysts yielding three lines of chimeric mice, which transmitted the disrupted allele through the germ line. All experiments reported here were performed with 129/Sv-C57BL/6J hybrid descendants (F1 and subsequent generations) of these animals consuming a normal chow diet (MF, Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan). To avoid differences resulting from diurnal changes in the reductase activity (21Hwa J.J. Zollman S. Warden C.H. Taylor B.A. Edwards P.A. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 711-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shapiro D.J. Rodwell V.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 37: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), mice were maintained on a strict 12-h light-dark cycle. One week prior to the measurement of reductase activities and sterol synthesis rates, mice were caged individually to minimize non-genetic variability (21Hwa J.J. Zollman S. Warden C.H. Taylor B.A. Edwards P.A. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 711-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of Embryos—Embryos were harvested from timed matings of heterozygous intercrosses. Genotyping of embryos was performed by Southern blotting of DNA isolated from fetal membranes or whole embryos. For genotyping of blastocysts, female heterozygote animals were superovulated with pregnant mare serum and human chorionic gonadotropin and mated to heterozygote males. Blastocysts were flushed from uteri at 3.5 days post coitum (E3.5), then lysed individually as described (23Feldman B. Poueymirou W. Papaioannou V.E. DeChiara T.M. Goldfarb M. Science. 1995; 267: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) and subjected to PCR analysis. Sense primers for mutant and wild-type allele were the primers 1 and 3, 5′-AGTCCCATAATCCTCTGCTTAGCTT-3′, respectively. Each allele was amplified separately with a common antisense primer, primer 4, 5′-CTACATTACCCTAAGCAGGCAATGT-3′ (Fig. 2A) for 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products for each blastocyst were subjected to 2%-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by Southern blotting with an internal primer. Control PCR experiments with limiting dilutions of Hmgcr+/– tail genomic DNA template demonstrated that the sensitivities for detecting mutant or wild-type allele were comparable. Mevalonate Supplementation—To test whether supplementation of mevalonate to pregnant females could rescue the homozygous embryos, dl-mevalonic acid lactone (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was infused via a miniosmotic pump (ALZET model 2004 osmotic pump, ALZA, Palo Alto, CA), which was implanted subcutaneously in female heterozygous mice. About 1 week after surgery, the mice were subjected to timed matings with heterozygous males. The pumps are designed to release the content constantly for 4 weeks, long enough to cover the entire pregnancy period. In a pilot experiment, plasma concentration of mevalonate rose from 25–35 ng/ml in non-treated females to 60,000–70,000 ng/ml in infused animals. Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts—Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from 14.5-day-old embryos and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). MEFs were used within three passages. All experiments were done when the cells reached subconfluence. Each monolayer was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, after which fresh media containing either 10% (v/v) FCS or 5 mg/ml human lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) with or without 100 nm simvastatin (Wako, Osaka, Japan) were added. Cells were incubated for 6 h and subjected to the following analyses. Simvastatin was activated by alkaline hydrolysis prior to use. HMG-CoA Reductase Activity Assay—For preparation of liver microsomes, animals were sacrificed during the early dark cycle, at a time when HMG-CoA reductase activity was at its peak of diurnal rhythm (21Hwa J.J. Zollman S. Warden C.H. Taylor B.A. Edwards P.A. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 711-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Livers were homogenized in a buffer containing 15 mm nicotinamide, 2 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resultant pellets, comprising a microsome fraction, were washed, resuspended in the same buffer, and stored in aliquots at –80 °C. HMG-CoA reductase activities were measured essentially as described previously (24Kita T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Briefly, the microsome fractions (∼50 μg) were incubated in 20 μl of a buffer containing 110 μm dl-[3-14C]HMG-CoA (4.5 μCi/μmol), 5 mm NADPH, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 30 min. Reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 2 n HCl and incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C to lactonize the mevalonate formed. The [14C]mevalonate was isolated by thin-layer chromatography and counted using [3H]mevalonate as an internal standard. For MEFs, cellular extracts were prepared as described (25Kaneko I. Hazama-Shimada Y. Endo A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Extracts (∼50 μg of protein) were incubated in 50 μl of a buffer containing 30 μm dl-[3-14C]HMG-CoA (20 μCi/μmol), 2.5 mm NADPH, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 120 min, then processed as in the assay of liver microsomes. HMG-CoA reductase activity is expressed as picomoles of [14C]mevalonate formed per minute per mg of protein. Measurement of Hepatic Cholesterol Synthesis—Cholesterol synthesis in the liver was estimated in littermate 12-week-old male mice (n = 6) during the mid light cycle as previously described (18Tozawa R.

In brief, animals were given food and water ad libitum and injected intraperitoneally with [2-14C]acetate (37 kBq/kg body weight). After 1 h, animals were euthanized and the liver was removed. Two portions of the liver (200–300 mg/each) were saponified, and the digitonin-precipitable sterols were isolated for the measurement of radioactivities. The results were expressed as 14C dpm/100 mg of wet weight of liver/h. Northern Blot Analysis—Poly(A+) RNA was isolated and pooled from the livers of five animals. 1.2 μg were subjected to 1%-agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of formalin. The fractionated RNA was transferred to Hybond N (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The filters were hybridized to 32P-labeled cDNA probes: HMG-CoA reductase, HMG-CoA synthase, mevalonate kinase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, squalene synthase, and LDL receptor. As a control for loading of mRNA, the same filter was hybridized with a GAPDH probe. Radioactivity was quantified with a PhosphorImager, and the results were corrected for loading with GAPDH, and the -fold increase in each mRNA was calculated. Other Assays—The content of cholesterol and triglycerides in plasma and liver was measured as described (18Tozawa R. Ishibashi S. Osuga J. Yagyu H. Oka T. Chen Z. Ohashi K. Perrey S. Shionoiri F.

Statistics—Data are represented as mean ± S.D. The Student's t test was used to compare the mean values between two groups. Embryonic Lethality of Hmgcr–/– Mice—A replacement-type vector, which allowed the deletion of exons 12–14 to abolish the translation of the entire carboxyl half of the enzyme, which is crucial for the catalytic activity (20Liscum L.

Acta. 2000; 1529: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), was constructed and used to generate heterozygous HMG-CoA reductase knockout mice (Hmgcr+/–). The heterozygous mutant mice appeared normal in their development and gross anatomy and were fertile. Intercrosses between heterozygotes yielded no viable offspring homozygous for the mutant Hmgcr allele (Hmgcr–/–) (+/+:+/–:–/– = 52:106:0, p < 0.0001, χ2 test) (Table I), indicating that Hmgcr expression is essential for the development and survival of embryos. To determine the developmental stage where the embryos were lethal, timed pregnancies of Hmgcr+/– matings were examined at E8.5 and 13.5 of gestation. No Hmgcr–/– embryos were identified at these time points (Table I). In addition, no resorbed embryos were detected, suggesting that death of Hmgcr null embryos occurs very early in the development, potentially prior to implantation. We therefore analyzed pre-implantation embryos. Superovulated Hmgcr+/– females were mated with Hmgcr+/– males, and blastocysts were isolated at E3.5. Blastocysts were genotyped directly by using PCR (Fig. 2). Among 74 phenotypically normal E3.5 blastocysts, 19 (26%) were found to be homozygotes (Table I and Fig. 2B). Therefore, at the blastocyst stage, Hmgcr–/– embryos were viable and identified at the expected Mendelian frequency. Hmgcr–/– blastocysts were morphologically indistinguishable from Hmgcr+/– or +/+ embryos.Table IGenotypes of offspring from intercrosses of Hmgcr+/– miceAgeGenotypeResorbedTotal+/++/--/-3 weeks521060NAaNA, not applicable.158E13.5370010E8.5-9.517260043E3.5134219NA74a NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab Attempt to Rescue the Homozygotes by Mevalonate Supplementation—If the embryonic lethality of the homozygotes results from the deficiency of mevalonate and subsequent sterol and non-sterol products of the mevalonate pathway, it is conceivable that supplementation of mevalonate would reverse the phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we supplemented the pregnant Hmgcr+/– mice with mevalonate using an osmotic pump, which was implanted subcutaneously. Although this intervention yielded a marked increase in the maternal plasma mevalonate level, no viable Hmgcr–/– offspring was obtained among 31 mice from 5 litters (Table II).Table IIEffects of maternal mevalonate supplementation on the genotypes of offspring from heterozygous intercrossesAgeAppearanceGenotypeTotalNormalAbnormalaAbnormal embryos were with egg cylinder stage appearance at E9.5-10.5 and their precise genotyping was not successful.+/++/--/-3 weeks3101021031E9.5-10.539101623049a Abnormal embryos were with egg cylinder stage appearance at E9.5-10.5 and their precise genotyping was not successful. Open table in a new tab To determine whether mevalonate supplementation allows null embryos to develop beyond implantation, we studied embryos at E9.5–10.5. 10 out of 49 (20%) decidua were remarkably smaller than the others and contained embryos with appearance corresponding to those at E5.5–6.5 (the egg cylinder stage). The remaining 39 normal-sized decidua contained phenotypically normal embryos, none of which were genotyped as homozygote (Table II). Hmgcr+/+ female mice, which were supplemented with mevalonate, mated to the same Hmgcr+/– males and examined at E9.5, gave rise to 20 decidua with equivalent size, which contained properly developed concepti. These results suggest that mevalonate supplementation of the pregnant females enabled Hmgcr–/– embryos to implant but failed to support the development after egg cylinder stage. Analysis of Heterozygous Mice—The Hmgcr mRNA levels in Hmgcr+/– mice were slightly reduced in the liver (Fig. 3). Expression levels of four genes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, both upstream and downstream of HMG-CoA reductase (encoding HMG-CoA synthase, mevalonate kinase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and squalene synthase), showed a 50–70% increase in the liver of heterozygotes, whereas the expression of the gene for LDL receptor remained unaffected. On the other hand, there was no significant change in the hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activities. Consistently, the amounts of [14C]acetate incorporated into digitonin-precipitable sterols in the liver were not different between the wild-type and heterozygous mice (Table III).Table IIIPhenotypic comparison of Hmgcr+/+ and Hmgcr+/– miceParameterNumber of miceGenotypeWild-typeHeterozygoteHMG-CoA reductase activity (pmol/mg protein/min)5129.6 ± 78.7117.5 ± 59.3[14C]Acetate incorporation into sterols (dpm/100 mg liver/h)61217.8 ± 793.41008.3 ± 436.3Liver cholesterol content (mg/g)53.5 ± 0.473.0 ± 0.44Liver triglyceride content (mg/g)515.2 ± 2.211.6 ± 6.3Plasma total cholesterol (mg/dl)1494.0 ± 19.4100.5 ± 30.9Plasma triglycerides (mg/dl)2082.3 ± 24.784.3 ± 35.3 Open table in a new tab Analysis of hepatic lipids demonstrated that both cholesterol and triglyceride content were unchanged. Plasma levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides did not differ in the two groups of mice. Plasma lipoprotein analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography revealed no discernible difference in the amount of each lipoprotein fraction (data not shown). Hmgcr+/– MEFs—To investigate the regulation of HMG-CoA reductase in Hmgcr+/– mice further, we isolated MEFs from Hmgcr+/– and Hmgcr+/+ embryos. Their growth in culture media was comparable. Fig. 4 summarizes HMG-CoA reductase activities of MEFs maintained for 6 h in the presence of either 10% FCS, or 5 mg/ml LPDS with or without 100 nm simvastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, which induces up-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase in vivo and in vitro. As expected, the enzyme activity in MEFs was up-regulated by the addition of LPDS and further induced by concomitant treatment with simvastatin. In each experimental condition, the HMG-CoA reductase activity was reduced by ∼50% in Hmgcr+/– MEFs. Increases in the enzymatic activities over the levels observed in the presence of FCS were approximately 2- and 12-fold in the presence of LPDS and in the presence of LPDS plus simvastatin, respectively, and did not differ significantly between heterozygous and wild-type MEFs. In the present study, we have demonstrated that HMG-CoA reductase is essential for the early development of the embryos. Null embryos were recovered at the blastocyst stage, but not at E8.5, indicating that loss of HMG-CoA reductase activity through targeted disruption of the gene in the germ line leads either to implantation failure or to embryonic death prior to implantation. Moreover, the lethal phenotypes of Hmgcr–/– embryos were not completely reversed by supplementation with mevalonate to the dams. Mammalian cells accelerate their growth rate dramatically upon implantation. Cholesterol synthesis in the embryos appears to begin at the peri-implantation stage (around E4–E5 in mice) (30Brewer L.M. Sheardown S.A. Brown N.A. Teratology. 1993; 47: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 31Pratt H.P. Dev. Biol. 1982; 89: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cholesterol plays an essential role in mammalian embryonic development, including the covalent modification of the morphogenic sonic hedgehog signal pathway during early gestation (32Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, defective cholesterol synthesis is unlikely to explain the peri-implantational lethality of Hmgcr–/– embryos, because mice lacking squalene synthase (Ss–/–), the first committed enzyme of sterol synthesis in the mevalonate pathway, are viable until around E9.5 even with gross growth retardation and defective neural tube closure (18Tozawa R. Ishibashi S. Osuga J. Yagyu H. Oka T. Chen Z. Ohashi K. Perrey S. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Harada K. Gotoda T. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30843-30848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Observations in Ss–/– embryos suggest that, even in the complete absence of endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis, maternally supplied cholesterol could, even although incompletely, support the embryonic growth by E9.5. The phenotype of Hmgcr null mice is strikingly more severe than that of Ss–/– mice. In addition to loss of de novo cholesterol synthesis, disruption of mevalonate synthesis has many ramifications, including loss of non-sterol isoprenoids essential for protein isoprenylation modifications and potential perturbation on N-linked glycosylation through inhibition of dolichol synthesis (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4519) Google Scholar). Non-sterol isoprenoids serve as lipid attachment for a variety of intracellular signaling molecules, including small GTP-binding proteins, such as Rho, Ras, and Rac, whose proper membrane localization and function are dependent on isoprenylation (33Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). Given the role that these proteins play in pathways regulating cell"
https://openalex.org/W2004786810,"Mer belongs to the Mer/Axl/Tyro3 receptor tyrosine kinase family, which regulates immune homeostasis in part by triggering monocyte ingestion of apoptotic cells. Mutations in Mer can also cause retinitis pigmentosa, again due to defective phagocytosis of apoptotic material. Although, some functional aspects of Mer have been deciphered, how receptor activation lead to the physiological consequences is not understood. By using yeast two-hybrid assays, we identified the carboxyl-terminal region of the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) Vav1 as a Mer-binding partner. Unlike similar (related) receptors, Mer interacted with Vav1 constitutively and independently of phosphotyrosine, yet the site of binding localized to the Vav1 SH2 domain. Mer activation resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 and release from Mer, whereas Vav1 was neither phosphorylated nor released from kinase-dead Mer. Mutation of the Vav1 SH2 domain phosphotyrosine coordinating Arg-696 did not alter Mer/Vav1 constitutive binding or Vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation but did retard Vav1 release from autophosphorylated Mer. Ligand-dependent activation of Mer in human monocytes led to Vav1 release and stimulated GDP replacement by GTP on RhoA family members. This unusual constitutive, SH2 domain-dependent, but phosphotyrosine-independent, interaction and its regulated local release and subsequent activation of Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA may explain how Mer coordinates precise cytoskeletal changes governing the ingestion of apoptotic material by macrophages and pigmented retinal epithelial cells.

The Mer receptor tyrosine kinase was identified by molecular rather than functional assays (1Graham D.K. Dawson T.L. Mullaney D.L. Snodgrass H.R. Earp H.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 647-657PubMed Google Scholar), and hence its physiological function and that of its two family members, Axl and Tyro3, has been elucidated slowly. Mer is primarily expressed in monocytes and cells of epithelial and reproductive origin with the highest levels of Mer mRNA detected in testis, ovary, prostate, kidney, lung, and peripheral blood monocytes (1Graham D.K. Dawson T.L. Mullaney D.L. Snodgrass H.R. Earp H.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 647-657PubMed Google Scholar, 2Graham D.K. Bowman G.W. Dawson T.L. Stanford W.L. Earp H.S. Snodgrass H.R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2349-2359PubMed Google Scholar). Mer is not expressed in normal B- and T-cells but Mer mRNA expression was detected in variety of human tumor cells, including neoplastic T and B cell lines; it is also present in the majority of childhood acute lymphoid leukemia samples tested. 1D. K. Graham, T. Dawson, H. R. Snodgrass, and H. S. Earp, unpublished data. The Mer extracellular region, like Axl and Tyro3, comprises two immunoglobulin-like and two fibronectin type III repeats, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain with an unusual KWIAIES motif (1Graham D.K.

Biochemical purification identified Gas-6 as a ligand for Axl and Tyro3; subsequent studies showed binding to Mer, but the affinity of Gas6 for Mer is considerably lower (29 nm) than its affinity for Axl and Tyro-3 (0.4 and 2.9 nm, respectively) (3Chen J.

To investigate the physiological function of Mer, our group generated a knockout mouse deleting the Mer tyrosine kinase domain (Mer kd) (7Camenisch T.D. Koller B.H. Earp H.S. Matsushima G.K. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3498-3503PubMed Google Scholar). Mer kd mice were extremely sensitive to endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) treatment exhibiting excessive TNF-α production by monocytes resulting in lethal endotoxic shock. The spleens of Mer kd mice were enlarged in some animals demonstrating accumulation of apoptotic debris (7Camenisch T.D. Koller B.H. Earp H.S. Matsushima G.K. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3498-3503PubMed Google Scholar), and the spleens were markedly enlarged in Mer, Axl, and Tyro3 triple-knockout mice (8Lu Q. Gore M. Zhang Q. Camenisch T. Boast S. Casagranda F. Lai C. Skinner M.K. Klein R. Matsushima G.K. Earp H.S. Goff S.P. Lemke G. Nature. 1999; 398: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a crucial role of Mer in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells was demonstrated in Mer kd mice. Monocytes bound but did not ingest apoptotic thymocytes, and the thymuses of dexamethasone-treated mice exhibited a marked diminution of apoptotic cell clearance (9Scott R.S. McMahon E.J. Pop S.M. Reap E.A. Caricchio R. Cohen P.L. Earp H.S. Matsushima G.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Phagocytosis of other particles was intact indicating a selective defect for apoptotic material in these animals (9Scott R.S. McMahon E.J. Pop S.M. Reap E.A. Caricchio R. Cohen P.L. Earp H.S. Matsushima G.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Indeed, the triple mutant mice lacking Mer, Axl, and Tyro3 receptors had very high levels of apoptotic cells in many organs, including liver, kidney, muscle, brain, spinal cord, and eye (10Lu Q. Lemke G. Science. 2001; 293: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Failure to ingest apoptotic self material led to evidence of autoimmunity in Mer kd mice (7Camenisch T.D. Koller B.H.

This genetic defect was traced to a deletion of a Mer splice acceptor site next to the second exon resulting in the loss of functional Mer. Gas6-mediated activation of Mer can result in the ingestion of shed photoreceptor outer segments by the cultured rat RPE cells (13Hall M.O. Prieto A.L. Obin M.S. Abrams T.A. Burgess B.L. Heeb M.J.

Subsequently, separate mutations in Mer each predicted to abrogate Mer tyrosine kinase activity were identified in three families with retinitis pigmentosa (16Gal A. Li Y. Thompson D.A. Weir J. Orth U. Jacobson S.G. Apfelstedt-Sylla E. Vollrath D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 270-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Individuals harboring these mutations suffer from progressive loss of vision, presumably due to defective phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor cells by RPE cells (16Gal A. Li Y. Thompson D.A. Weir J. Orth U. Jacobson S.G. Apfelstedt-Sylla E. Vollrath D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 270-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). To study Mer function we stably transfected the IL-3-dependent murine hematopoietic cell line 32Dc13 (32D) with an EGF receptor extracellular and transmembrane domain-Mer cytoplasmic domain chimera. In these cells, EGF-dependent Mer signaling prevented apoptosis upon IL-3 and serum withdrawal. In contrast to transfected full-length EGF receptor and other receptor tyrosine kinases, Mer prevented 32D cell apoptosis without stimulating cellular proliferation. When combined with IL-3, Mer signaling produced dramatic shape changes, suggesting involvement of Mer tyrosine kinase in cytoskeletal remodeling (17Guttridge K. Luft C.J. Dawson T.L. Kozlowska E. Mahajan N.P. Varnum B. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24057-24066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Mer signaling brings about cytoskeletal changes in experimental (32D) or physiological (monocytes or macrophages) processes remains obscure. Here we demonstrate that Mer interacts constitutively with the SH2 domain of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Vav1. Surprisingly, this SH2 domain/Mer interaction is phosphotyrosine-independent. Mer activation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and release of Vav1 and activation of Rho family members. This unusual constitutive, SH2 domain-dependent but phosphotyrosine-independent interaction and release may provide the circumscribed local cytoskeletal control necessary to trigger ingestion of apoptotic material bound to the surface of phagocytic monocytes or pigmented epithelial cells. Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—A chimeric receptor was constructed wherein the extracellular domain of Mer was replaced with a ligand binding and transmembrane domain of the rat EGF receptor (Fig. 1A), using a suitable SalI restriction site at juxtamembrane region of these two receptors. The entire coding region of chimeric receptor of 1142 amino acids was subcloned into pLXSN, a mammalian retroviral expression vector (Clontech). This E GFR-M er C himeric receptor was named EMC. For construction of the “bait” plasmid pNCMY, 290 amino acids of the carboxyl-terminal intracellular region of Mer (amino acids 546-836), which includes the entire kinase domain, was amplified by PCR and inserted in-frame to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain of the pAS2-1 vector (Fig. 1A). Full-length Vav1 and all the Vav1 truncation constructs were generated by PCR amplification using pJC11 plasmid (kindly provided by Prof. C. J. Der) as template and Pfx polymerase, which has proofreading ability (Invitrogen). The PCR products were digested with XhoI and HindIII and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pcDNA4.1/Myc-His vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with a myc epitope-encoding region (Fig. 1B). The Mer truncation constructs AMer (aa 529-999), BMer (aa 621-999), CMer (aa 690-999), DMer (aa 529-696), EMer (aa 755-999), and FMer (aa 777-999) were generated by PCR amplification using full-length Mer as template and Pfx polymerase. The PCR products were digested with XhoI and HindIII and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pcDNA4.1/Myc-His vector. The 3′ primers used in Mer truncation constructs had a stop codon thus no tag was present in AMer, BMer, CMer, DMer, EMer, and FMer (Fig. 5A). For expression of GST-Mer fusion proteins, intracellular region (carboxyl-terminal 415 amino acids) of Mer was PCR-amplified using Pfx polymerase. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and SalI and subcloned into pGEX-4T vector in appropriate reading frame (Fig. 1A). Mutagenesis of Mer and Vav1 proteins was performed using GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). All the plasmid constructs were sequenced to confirm the authenticity.Fig. 5Vav1 recognize carboxyl-terminal region of Mer.

A-FMer constructs were co-transfected with Vav1 in 293T cells, and lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-Mer (in the cases of A-CMer, EMer, and FMer) or anti-EGFR (in the case of DMer) antibodies. Immune complexes were analyzed using anti-myc, anti-Mer, and anti-Mer Ab2 antibodies.

Y190 cells transformed with pNCMY produced expected fusion proteins of 69 kDa, detected by Western blotting with an antibody against the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). A human bone marrow cDNA library was screened. 1 × 106 transformants were plated on SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His/-Ade plates. The colonies that grew on these plates were further screened and “true positive” were selected, based on the criterion that these colonies could not induce His or β-galactosidase production when plasmid DNA isolated from these “positive” colonies was transformed into yeast cells carrying pAS2-1 vector. To further confirm, the colony-lift β-galactosidase filter assay was performed according to manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). Antibodies, Cell Lines, Immunoprecipitations, and Immunoblot Analysis—A polypeptide containing the carboxyl-terminal 90 amino acids of Mer was expressed as GST fusion protein in DH5α Escherichia coli strain and plated onto ampicillin plates. Colonies were picked and grown overnight in 10 ml of LB containing ampicillin. Overnight grown culture was added to 300 ml of fresh LB containing ampicillin and grown for 2 h, which was followed by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside addition (0.1 mm final concentration). Culture was grown for 2 more h, and cells were harvested, lysed in Lysis Buffer, containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 15% glycerol, phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO4), and protease inhibitor mix (25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 25 μg ml pepstatin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were incubated with glutathione beads for 2 h, followed by washing with lysis buffer and elution in PBS containing 10 mm glutathione. Eluted protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT, to remove all glutathione. The purified polypeptide was then used to generate rabbit polyclonal antibody. Anti-Mer Ab2 (Clone 110) was obtained from FabGennix International. Anti-Vav1 antibody was purchased from UBI. Anti-phosphotyrosine (RC20) antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-Rac1, anti-RhoA, and anti-Cdc42 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG)-HRP, and goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-myc monoclonal antibody was obtained from Invitrogen. Human SV40-transformed embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. 32D cells were maintained in RPMI medium containing 15% fetal calf serum and 5% WEHI cell-spent media (IL-3). 293T cells were transfected using FuGENE (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Thirty-two hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 16 h and treated for 20 min with EGF (100 ng/ml). Cells were harvested, immediately washed in ice cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed in receptor lysis buffer (RLB), containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 175 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 15% glycerol, phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO4), and protease inhibitor mix (25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 25 μg/ml pepstatin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equivalent amounts of protein were incubated with respective primary antibodies for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min. The beads were washed three times in the RLB buffer, resuspended in the appropriate volume of Laemmli gel loading buffer, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (for pTyr blots) or 5% milk in TBST buffer (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h. Blocked filters were probed with primary antibodies in the same buffer, followed by secondary antibody conjugated to HRP in blocking solution and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were re-probed with a second set of antibodies (anti-Mer or anti-myc) to confirm the presence of respective proteins. Purification of Recombinant Proteins LVav and KVav from Sf9 Insect Cells—Baculovirus expression constructs were generated using the pFast Bac method (Invitrogen-Brl). SH3-SH2-SH3 and SH3-SH3 domains of Vav1 were PCR-amplified using CVav and JVav as templates and were subcloned along with a 5′ six-histidine tag into the XbaI and SalI sites of pDR120 vector, named as LVav and KVav, respectively. Expression of LVav and KVav in recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cell extracts was confirmed by Western analysis with anti-polyhistidine antibodies. 200 ml of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were used for the purification of the protein. Cells were harvested 3 days following infection with the virus. Cell pellets from (6 × 107 cells) were suspended in an extraction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The extract was sonicated for 1-min pulses and then clarified by centrifugation twice at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was added to 2 ml (50% slurry) of pre-equilibrated Talon affinity beads (Clontech). Binding was done for 2 h in the cold room. The unbound proteins were removed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 2 min. The beads were washed with 10 ml of extraction buffer thrice. After final wash the beads were transferred to 15-ml chromatographic columns (Bio-Rad). The beads were subsequently washed with 10 bed volumes of wash buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The bound proteins were eluted in buffer containing 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol and collected as 0.5-ml fractions. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The fractions containing the purified protein were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The protein concentration was determined by using the Bradford method. Small aliquots of the purified protein were stored at -80 °C. Purification of GST-Mer and in Vitro Binding Assay—GST-Mer construct was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells and plated onto ampicillin plates. Colonies were picked and grown overnight in 10 ml of LB containing ampicillin. Culture, grown overnight, was added to 300 ml of fresh LB containing ampicillin and grown for 2 h, which was followed by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside addition (0.1 mm final concentration). Culture was grown for 4 more hours, and cells were harvested, lysed in lysis buffer, containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 15% glycerol, phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO4), and protease inhibitor mix. Lysates were incubated with glutathione beads for 2 h, followed by washing with lysis buffer and elution in PBS containing 10 mm glutathione. Eluted protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT, to remove all glutathione. For the in vitro binding assay, 50 nm purified LVav or KVav were added to Talon beads resuspended in modified RLB containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 175 mm NaCl, 0.4% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 15% glycerol, 1% protease-free bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitor mix. After 1 h, Talon beads were washed to remove all unbound proteins. Purified GST-Mer (50 mm) was added to similarly treated Talon beads without Vav1 domain proteins or to Talon beads with bound LVav or KVav. Following incubation on ice for 30 min and then incubation with shaking at 4 °C for 1 h, beads were washed thrice with lysis buffer. Bound protein was dissociated from beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer and assessed by gel electrophoresis, transfer, and detection by immunoblotting with anti-Mer antibody. In a control experiment, the use of NaCl concentration above 175 mm prevented detection of GST-Mer/LVav interaction. Assay for Detection of Activated Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42—The glutathione-Sepharose beads conjugated with GST-Pak (PBD) or GST-Rok (RBD) were used as specific probes for in vitro binding assays of activated Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA, respectively. Stable cell lines expressing EMC and kdEMC were grown overnight in serum-free media with 5% WEHI cells spent media (IL-3). Next day, cells were stimulated with EGF ligand for 20 or 30 min. Cells were lysed in MLB buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, protease, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture). Samples of 500 μg of protein lysates were mixed with 20 μl of PBD beads and incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed three times in MLB buffer and analyzed by Western blotting to detect the bound Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases. For RhoA, cells were lysed in RLB buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, protease, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture). Samples of 500 μg of protein lysates were mixed with 30 μl of RBD beads and incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed three times in wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, protease, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture) and analyzed by Western blotting. Isolation of Human Macrophages—Human blood (buffy coat) was diluted to 50% with PBS and mixed gently. The mixture was gently layered over 50 ml of Ficoll (Histopaque-1077, Sigma). After centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 30 min the mononuclear cell layer was collected and washed four times with PBS and plated in RPMI media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 2 h of incubation, adherant monocytes and macrophages were retained and allowed to grow for 7-10 days in RPMI media, before Gas6 treatment. Mer Interacts with GEF and Vav1—Downstream effectors of Mer signaling were sought by yeast two-hybrid methods (18Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4860) Google Scholar). A human bone marrow cDNA library was screened with the Mer cytoplasmic domain (pNCMY vector, Fig. 1A) as bait. Of nine positive colonies, three encoded the carboxyl-terminal SH3-SH2-SH3 domains of Vav1 (CVavΔN depicted in Fig. 1B). This prototypic GEF is a 97-kDa protein with multiple structural motifs (Fig. 1B), including, from the carboxyl to the amino termini, the following domain/motifs: a calponin homology (CH), an acidic region (Ac), a Dbl-homology (DH), a pleckstrin-homology (PH), a zinc finger domain (ZF), a short proline-rich region (PR), and two SH3 domains flanking a single SH2 region (21Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Clones for two other Mer interacting proteins, Grb2 and Shc (19Ling L. Kung H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6582-6592Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Georgescu M. Kirsch K.H. Shishido T. Zong C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1171-1181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were also isolated. Because Gas6 had not yet been identified as a ligand for Axl, Tyro3, or Mer when our studies began, we created a ligand-activated EGFR-Mer-chimera (EMC), using the rat EGF receptor extracellular and transmembrane domains and the Mer intracellular domain (Fig. 1A). EMC was stably transfected into mouse 32D cells, and, when activated with ligand, it prevented apoptosis upon IL-3 withdrawal from this IL-3-requiring cell line. Unlike most receptor tyrosine kinases, Mer activation did not stimulate proliferation, but it did alter cell adherence and shape in these normally suspension-growing cells (17Guttridge K. Luft C.J. Dawson T.L. Kozlowska E. Mahajan N.P. Varnum B. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24057-24066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This positive effect on cytoskeletal components coupled with the fact that Mer knockout mice exhibited defects in local cytoskeletal regulation (phagocytosis), and the strong positive yeast two-hybrid signal, led us to pursue the interaction and potential physiological role of the Mer/Vav1 complex. For these studies full-length Vav1 and truncated constructs were generated using vector pcDNA4 (depicted in Fig. 1B) and tagged with an myc epitope. Each construct gave generally equivalent expression when transfected into 293T cells (Fig. 1C). The AVav construct, which was not myc-tagged and thus was detected using Vav1 antibodies, also expressed equivalently to Vav1 (Fig. 1D). Vav1 interaction with the Mer intracellular domain was studied by co-transfection with either EMC or an EMC with a K619M site-directed mutation that destroyed kinase activity (kinase-dead EMC or kdEMC). Activation of Mer Lead to Dissociation of Mer/Vav1 Complex and Vav1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation—To confirm Vav1/Mer interactions, EMC-expressing 32D cells were stimulated with EGF, and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 was detected. Surprisingly, Vav1 co-immunoprecipitated with unactivated EMC. 3N. P. Mahajan and H. Shelton Earp, unpublished results. To study this interaction in more detail, myc-tagged Vav1 constructs were co-transfected in 293T cells with EMC or kdEMC. Vav1 was readily detected in Mer immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells, but the level of Mer-associated Vav1 decreased considerably with ligand stimulation (Fig. 2A, first panel, lanes 1 and 2). When co-transfected with kdEMC, Vav1 was present in the kdEMC immunoprecipitates from both untreated and EGF-treated lysed cells (Fig. 2A, first panel, lanes 3 and 4). Activation of EMC increased Vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, second panel, lanes 1 and 2). This was not observed in kdEMC-expressing cells (Fig. 2A, second panel, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, in unstimulated cells Vav1 is, at least in part, constitutively bound to Mer. Ligand activation and Mer autophosphorylation resulted in dissociation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav1 (compare Fig. 2A, first panel, lane 2 to second panel, lane 2). Upon co-transfection, the carboxyl-terminal SH3-SH2-SH3, CVav, was also readily detected in EMC immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells and was tyrosine-phosphorylated and released from this association upon Mer stimulation (Fig. 2B, second panel). This indicates that at least one site for Mer-dependent Vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation differs from the N-terminal Tyr-174 known to be phosphorylated by LCK (21Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). When co-transfected with kdEMC, CVav was bound to Mer regardless of ligand additi"

We now report that activation of PKC targets death receptor signaling complex formation. Pre-treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA) led to inhibition of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, which was characterized by a reduction in phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, decreased caspase-8 processing, and incomplete maturation and activation of caspase-3. These effects of PMA were completely abrogated by the PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide I (Bis I), clearly implicating PKC in the protective effect of PMA. TRAIL-induced mitochondrial release of the apoptosis mediators cytochrome c and Smac was blocked by PMA. This, together with the observed decrease in Bid cleavage, suggested that PKC activation modulates apical events in TRAIL signaling upstream of mitochondria. This was confirmed by analysis of TRAIL death-inducing signaling complex formation, which was disrupted in PMA-treated cells as evidenced by a marked reduction in Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) recruitment, an effect that could not be explained by any change in FADD phosphorylation state. In an in vitro binding assay, the intracellular domains of both TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 bound FADD: activation of PKC significantly inhibited this interaction suggesting that PKC may be targeting key apical components of death receptor signaling. Significantly, this effect was not confined to TRAIL, because isolation of the native TNF receptor signaling complex revealed that PKC activation also inhibited TNF receptor-associated death domain protein recruitment to TNF-R1 and TNF-induced phosphorylation of IκB-α. Taken together, these results show that PKC activation specifically inhibits the recruitment of key obligatory death domain-containing adaptor proteins to their respective membrane-associated signaling complexes, thereby modulating TRAIL-induced apoptosis and TNF-induced NF-κB activation, respectively.

Members of this subfamily are characterized by a number of conserved cysteine-rich repeats within the extracellular domain and the presence of a “death domain” (DD) motif within the intracellular domain. The DD was first identified in the intracellular domain of TNF receptor-1 (TNF-R1) and was described as a region of ∼80 amino acids containing a number of key residues that appeared to be critical for TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. These residues also appear to be highly conserved within other members of the death receptor subfamily (1Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5126) Google Scholar). TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) was identified because of its high sequence homology to other TNF family members (2Pitti R.M. Marsters S.A. Ruppert S. Donahue C.J. Moore A. Ashkenazi A.

The TRAIL receptor family is unusually complex in that it consists of at least four membrane-bound members. TRAIL-R1 (DR4) and -R2 (DR5, Killer, and TRICK2) are death receptors and contain a DD motif within the intracellular domain similar to CD95/Fas/APO-1 and TNF-R1 (1Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5126) Google Scholar). Two other receptors TRAIL-R3 (DcR1, LIT, and TRID) and -R4 (DcR2 and TRUNDD) lack or contain an incomplete DD and are therefore incapable of inducing apoptosis. Ectopic expression of TRAIL-R3 and -R4 has been demonstrated to attenuate TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and they are therefore often described as “decoy receptors” (4Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). TRAIL signals apoptosis through formation of a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Ligation of TRAIL-R1 and -R2 by TRAIL leads to rapid recruitment of the adaptor protein FADD/MORT1 (5Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A.

FADD is a bipartite molecule with a C-terminal DD and an N-terminal death effector domain and appears to be a universal adaptor protein, because it is required for cytotoxicity induced by other death receptor subfamily members (8Yeh W.C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W.

FADD binding to the receptor occurs through a homophilic DD interaction while the death effector domain mediates the interaction with similar motifs in the prodomain of the initiator caspase, caspase-8. Procaspase-8 is activated at the DISC by an autocatalytic mechanism, which is dependent on the proximity of other procaspase-8 molecules (10Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Following activation, caspase-8 mediates apoptosis either by the direct activation of down-stream effector caspases or through cleavage of pro-apoptotic molecules such as the Bcl-2 homolog, Bid (11Luo X.

The importance of TRAIL as a potential therapeutic agent became obvious when it was demonstrated to be selectively toxic to transformed and tumor cells but not to the majority of normal cells (1Ashkenazi A.

Med. 1988; 67: 1067-1085Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this differential sensitivity was initially attributed to the presence of TRAIL “decoy receptors” on normal cells, however, recent studies have failed to correlate decoy receptor expression with TRAIL sensitivity (18Griffith T.S.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2747-2753PubMed Google Scholar), and there has been growing evidence to suggest that TRAIL resistance may instead be regulated intracellularly. Several intracellular proteins have been implicated in providing resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The inactive caspase-8 homolog, cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), interferes with the activation of procaspase-8 at the DISC (20Thome M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Fickenscher H. Meinl E. Neipel F. Mattmann C. Burns K. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Scaffidi C. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 386: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar), with high basal FLIP expression often correlating with resistance to TRAIL. In support of this, modulation of c-FLIP levels by metabolic inhibitors has been demonstrated to sensitize some of these resistant cell types to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (18Griffith T.S. Chin W.A. Jackson G.C. Lynch D.H. Kubin M.Z. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2833-2840PubMed Google Scholar, 21Leverkus M. Neumann M. Mengling T. Rauch C.T. Brocker E.B. Krammer P.H. Walczak H.

Other inhibitors include the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins, in particular X-linked IAP (XIAP), which blocks apoptosis by directly inhibiting effector caspases (22Deveraux Q.L. Roy N.

Pro-survival signaling pathways that have been implicated in TRAIL resistance include activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (24Jeremias I. Kupatt C. Baumann B. Herr I. Wirth T. Debatin K.M.

Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that TRAIL sensitivity can be modulated by activation or inhibition of NF-κB and that, in some contexts, modulation of NF-κB activation at the DISC may be a key determinant of sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (27Harper N.

Recent observations have also implicated the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway in the protection of cells from apoptosis in a number of systems, including those induced by death receptor ligation (28Gomez-Angelats M.

Ruiz-Ruiz C. Robledo G. Lopez-Rivas A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4323-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to further examine the mechanism by which 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA)-mediated PKC activation modulates TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity. In the present study, we demonstrate that pre-treatment with PMA inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. TRAIL DISC formation was found to be disrupted in PMA-treated cells as judged by a reduction in recruitment of the obligatory adaptor molecule FADD and the initiator caspase-8. These effects of PMA were completely abrogated by the PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide I (Bis I), thus implicating a key role for PKC in the modulation of DISC components. Further support for this was provided by the observation that formation of the TNF receptor signaling complex was similarly affected with a decrease in TRADD recruitment being evident in PMA-treated cells. In summary, our results demonstrate that PKC activation modulates the ability of obligatory death domain-containing receptor signaling components to interact with one another, thus providing another potential mechanism whereby cells can modulate TNF-induced NF-κB activation and TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity, respectively. Materials—Bisindolylmaleimide I (GF 109203X) and PMA were purchased from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK) and Sigma (Poole, UK), respectively. Recombinant human TRAIL (residues 95–281) was produced as previously described (32MacFarlane M. Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Cohen G.M. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

Hughes M. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; : 25534-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Antibodies were sourced as follows: anti-FADD mAb and anti-TRADD mAb were from BD Transduction Laboratories (Heidelberg, Germany); anti-RIP mAb and anti-TRAF2 mAb were from BD Pharmingen; anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) mAb and anti-TRAIL-R1 and -R2 were from Alexis Corp.

TRAIL receptor antibodies (clones M271, M413, M430, and M444, respectively), used for flow cytometry, were a kind gift from Immunex Corp. (Seattle, WA) (35Griffith T.S. Rauch C.T. Smolak P.J.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit, were obtained from Sigma and DAKO (Cambridge, UK), respectively. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were from Sigma or Fisher (Loughborough, UK). Cell Culture—All cell culture materials were from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK) and plasticware from BD Biosciences Labware (Bedford, MA). HeLa cells (ECCAC, Wiltshire, UK) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere by routine passage every 3 days. Determination of Apoptosis by Annexin V Staining—Apoptotic cells were quantified by measuring externalized phosphatidylserine (PS) assessed by Annexin V labeling and by propidium iodide uptake as described previously (36MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. Dickens M. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (27Harper N.

Analysis of Cytochrome c and Smac Release from Mitochondria— Mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac was performed using a digitonin lysis method essentially as described previously (37Ekert P.G.

Analysis of TRAIL Receptors by Flow Cytometry—Control and treated HeLa cells were subjected to limited trypsinization, resuspended in blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) and incubated for 30 min on ice to block nonspecific antibody binding. Cells were then labeled with anti-TRAIL receptor antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (39MacFarlane M. Harper N. Snowden R.T. Dyer M.J. Barnett G.A. Pringle J.H. Cohen G.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6809-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Analysis of TRAIL Receptor Aggregation—To observe aggregated TRAIL receptors, DISCs were precipitated as described above and subjected to gel electrophoresis in the absence of reducing agents followed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies as has been described previously (40Kischkel F.C.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 6564-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Receptor aggregates appeared as higher molecular weight bands, corresponding to either dimers or trimers of the respective TRAIL receptors. Expression of GST Fusion Proteins and in Vitro Interactions—GST fusion proteins were created by fusing glutathione S-transferase (GST) to the N terminus of the intracellular domains (ICDs) of TRAIL-R1 (residues 269–468) and TRAIL-R2 (residues 209–411). DNA encoding these residues was cloned in-frame into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX4T (Amersham Biosciences, Bucks, UK). Receptor fusion proteins were overexpressed in XA-90 cells, kindly provided by Prof. D. Riches (National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Colorado), by inducing with 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside for 3 h, and cells were then lysed by sonication in 1.5% (w/v) Sarkosyl, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol and Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The dialyzed lysate was bound to 1.5 ml of washed glutathione-Sepharose beads (50% slurry in PBS) for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and the amount of purified GST fusion protein was quantified by Coomassie Blue staining and comparison with bovine serum albumin standards. To assess GST-TRAIL-R-ICD protein binding, HeLa cells were either left untreated or treated with PMA (20 ng/ml) for 30 min, then washed once with PBS and harvested by trypsinization. Cell pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer (see above) and incubated on ice for 45 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and aliquots of the supernatant containing 5 mg of protein (10 mg/ml) were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 10 μg of purified GST-ICD fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Control pull-down assays were carried out using beads coated with purified GST alone. Bound proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 200 × g for 3 min, washed five times in PBS containing protease inhibitors, and released from beads by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. The interaction of FADD with GST-TRAIL-R-ICDs was assessed by Western blotting. Analysis of FADD by Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Two-dimensional electrophoresis was carried out using the IPGphor system (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, TRAIL DISC samples were resuspended in rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 2% IPG buffer, pH 4–7 (Amersham Biosciences), trace bromphenol blue) and mixed at room temperature for 4 h. Samples were then applied to IPG (Immobilized pH Gradient) strips with a pH range of 4–7. Strips were then subjected to active rehydration at 50 V for 12 h followed by isoelectric focusing (500 V for 30 min, 1000 V for 30 min, then 8000 V for 1 h). After focusing, strips were equilibrated in SDS equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% (w/v) glycerol, 2% SDS, trace bromphenol blue) for 15 min at room temperature. Second dimension electrophoresis and Western blotting were then carried out as described above. PMA Inhibits TRAIL-induced Apoptosis in HeLa Cells—To further elucidate the role of PKC in death receptor-induced apoptosis, HeLa cells were treated with the PKC activator, PMA, and its effect on TRAIL-induced apoptosis was assessed. Pre-treatment of HeLa cells with 20 ng/ml PMA completely abrogated TRAIL-induced apoptosis as measured by inhibition of both phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and TRAIL-induced cleavage of the caspase-3/-7 substrate PARP (Fig. 1A). Treatment with PMA alone was not cytotoxic to HeLa cells at the concentration used (data not shown). To investigate the mechanism by which PMA protects cells from TRAIL, cell pellets were subjected to Western blotting for a number of components of the TRAIL receptor signaling pathway. Caspase-8 is known to be the apical caspase activated during TRAIL-induced apoptosis and is recruited and processed at the DISC in a FADD- and TRAIL-dependent manner (5Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A.

The caspase-8 zymogen exists as two splice forms, p55 and p53, which are activated in a two-step process involving the removal of the small subunit, p12, to generate p43 and p41 intermediates. A second cleavage then results in the removal of the large p18 subunit (43Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2072084253,"The PB1 (Phox and Bem 1) domain is a recently identified module that mediates formation of a heterodimeric complex with other PB1 domain, e.g. the complexes between the phagocyte oxidase activators p67 phox and p40 phox and between the yeast polarity proteins Bem1p and Cdc24p. These PB1 domains harbor either a conserved lysine residue on one side or an acidic OPCA (OPR/PC/AID) motif around the other side; the lysine of p67 phox or Bem1p likely binds to the OPCA of p40 phox or Cdc24p, respectively, via electrostatic interactions. To further understand molecular recognition by PB1 domains, here we investigate the interactions mediated by proteins presenting both the lysine and OPCA on a single PB1 domain, namely Par6, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), and ZIP. Par6 and aPKC form a complex via the interaction of the Par6 lysine with aPKC-OPCA but not via that between the aPKC lysine and Par6-OPCA, thereby localizing to the tight junction of epithelial cells. aPKC also uses its OPCA to interact with ZIP, another protein that has a PB1 domain presenting both the lysine and OPCA, whereas aPKC binds via the conserved lysine to MEK5 in the same manner as ZIP interacts with MEK5. In addition, ZIP can form a homotypic complex via the conserved electrostatic interactions. Thus the PB1 domain appears to be a protein module that fully exploits its two mutually interacting elements in molecular recognition to expand its repertoire of protein-protein interactions.

Thus the PB1 domain appears to be a protein module that fully exploits its two mutually interacting elements in molecular recognition to expand its repertoire of protein-protein interactions. The cytoplasmic proteins that control the signaling pathways and regulatory systems in eukaryotic cells are commonly constructed of modular domains that mediate molecular interactions or have an enzymatic function (1Pawson T. Nash P. Science. 2003; 300: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Interaction domains bind specifically to one another or to phospholipids, nucleic acids, or small molecule second messengers. Several protein interaction domains recognize specific sequences exposed on their partner proteins to mediate a modular protein-protein interaction: the SH2 1The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology (domain); PB1, Phox and Bem 1; OPCA, OPR/PC/AID; aPKC, atypical protein kinase C; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; HA, hemagglutinin; PC, Phox and Cdc; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MDCK cells, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CAD, caspase-activated DNase; ICAD, inhibitor of CAD; PDZ, PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1; wt, wild type; ZIP, PKCζ-interacting protein. domain binds to specific phosphotyrosine motifs (2Yaffe M.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar); the SH3 domain makes contact with a proline-rich region (3Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and the PDZ domain interacts with the C terminus of target proteins in a sequence-specific manner, or with another PDZ domain to form a heterodimer (4Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). By using combinations of these modules, protein networks have presumably been developed for fine regulation of various cellular activities. Among modules that mediate protein-protein interactions is the PB1 (Phox and Bem 1) domain, which has been recently identified (5Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This domain, comprising about 80 amino acid residues (Fig. 1A), is designated as such because it was originally found in the phagocyte oxidase activator p67 phox and the yeast polarity protein Bem1p (5Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). According to a recent computer search (6Letunic I. Goodstadt L. Dickens N.J. Doerks T. Schultz J. Mott R. Ciccarelli F. Copley R.R. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), the PB1 domain is known to occur in nearly 200 proteins in yeasts, plants, and animals. Structural analysis by NMR has revealed that the Bem1p PB1 domain adopts a ubiquitin-like β-grasp fold and presents a conserved lysine residue on the first β-strand (7Terasawa H. Noda Y. Ito T. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3947-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The PB1 domains of p67 phox and Bem1p interact, via the lysine, with p40 phox and Cdc24p, respectively, by recognizing the PC (Phox and Cdc) motif in these target proteins (8Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Mizuki K. Hata K. Ago T. Kitajima S. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The PC motif (8Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Mizuki K. Hata K. Ago T. Kitajima S. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), also known as OPR (9Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) or AID (10Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), is an ∼20-amino acid stretch composed of conserved acidic and hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1A) and is presently designated as the OPCA (OPR/PC/AID) motif (11Ponting C.P. Ito T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Current sequence and structural analyses show that the OPCA motif are all embedded within PB1 domain homologues (11Ponting C.P. Ito T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the PB1 domains of p40 phox and Cdc24p contain an OPCA motif, and those of p67 phox and Bem1p do not (Fig. 1A). The conserved lysine found in p67 phox and Bem1p, however, is replaced by arginine in p40 phox and Cdc24p (Fig. 1A). Interactions between PB1 domains appear to participate in a variety of biological events. The NADPH oxidase in mammalian phagocytes is dormant in resting cells but becomes activated during phagocytosis to produce superoxide, a precursor of microbicidal oxidants (12Nauseef W.M. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1999; 111: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Clark R.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: S309-S317Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Bokoch G.M. Diebold B.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 2692-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The activation of the oxidase requires translocation of p67 phox , p47 phox , p40 phox , and the small GTPase Rac from the cytoplasm to the membrane, where they assemble to activate the catalytic core of the oxidase, i.e. membrane-integrated cytochrome b 558 (12Nauseef W.M. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1999; 111: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Clark R.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: S309-S317Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Bokoch G.M. Diebold B.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 2692-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In this process, p40 phox functions via the PB1-PB1 interaction with p67 phox (Fig. 1B) to greatly enhance the membrane recruitment of p67 phox and p47 phox (15Kuribayashi F. Nunoi N. Wakamatsu K. Tsunawaki S. Sato K. Ito T. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6312-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The PB1-mediated interaction between Bem1p and Cdc24p (Fig. 1B) plays a crucial role in the polarity establishment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is essential for both budding and mating (5Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 16Butty A.-C. Perrinjaquet N. Petit A. Jaquenoud M. Segall J.E. Hofmann K. Zwahlen C. Peter M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1565-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The Bem1p and Cdc24p homologues of the fission yeast, scd2 and scd1, respectively, also form a complex via the PB1-PB1 interaction (5Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H.

In mammalian epithelial cells, the Par6-aPKC-Par3 complex localizes to the tight junction and is considered to be involved in the establishment and maintenance of apico-basolateral polarity (18Ohno S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 19Wodarz A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E39-E44Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 20Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In contrast to the conventional PB1 domains, Par6-PB1 and aPKC-PB1 possess both the conserved lysine and OPCA motif (Fig. 1A). Here we show that Par6 interacts with aPKC via binding of the conserved lysine of Par6-PB1 to the OPCA motif of aPKC-PB1. The interaction by itself is required for localization of both proteins to the tight junction, which likely plays a crucial role in polarity establishment in epithelial cells. Based on experiments using various PB1 domains, we describe molecular mechanism underlying target recognition by the interaction module. Plasmid Construction—Complementary DNA fragments encoding various lengths of Par6α, Par6β, Par6γ, PKCι/λ, PKCζ, and ZIP were prepared as described previously (5Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24Noda Y. Takeya R. Ohno S. Naito S. Ito T. Sumimoto H.

We also amplified the DNA fragment that encodes MEK5 (amino acid residues 1–165) by reverse transcriptase-PCR using mRNA from human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The DNA fragments were ligated to the indicated expression vectors. Mutations leading to the indicated amino acid substitutions were introduced by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutated fragments were cloned into the indicated vectors. All of the constructs were sequenced to confirm their identities. Two-hybrid Experiments—Various combinations between pGBT and pGADGH plasmids were co-transformed into competent yeast Y190 cells containing HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes, as described previously (33Koga H.

Following selection for the Trp+ and Leu+ phenotype, the transformants were tested for their ability to grow on plates lacking histidine supplemented with 25 mm 3-aminotriazole to suppress background growth, according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Clontech). An in Vitro Pull-down Binding Assay Using Purified Proteins—For expression in Escherichia coli, cDNA fragments were ligated to the following vectors: pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) for glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein; pMALc2 (New England Biolabs) for maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion protein; or pProEX-HTb (Invitrogen) for His-tagged protein. GST-, MBP-, or His-tagged proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), amylose resin (New England Biolabs), or His-bind resin (Novagen), respectively, according to the manufacturers' protocols. Pull-down binding assays were performed as described previously (24Noda Y. Takeya R. Ohno S. Naito S. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 34Ago T. Nunoi H. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol.

Briefly, a pair of GST and MBP fusion proteins or a pair of GST fusion and His-tagged proteins were mixed in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. A slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B or amylose resin was subsequently added, followed by further incubation for 60 min at 4 °C. After washing two times with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 10 mm dithiothreitol, proteins were eluted from glutathione-Sepharose 4B with 10 mm glutathione or from amylose resin with 10 mm maltose. The eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). In Vivo Interaction of Par6 with aPKC—COS-7 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with the expression vector pEF-BOS (36Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar), which encodes the indicated protein, and cultured for 40 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (24Noda Y. Takeya R. Ohno S. Naito S. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Kohjima M. Noda Y. Takeya R. Saito N. Takeuchi K. Sumimoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed with 1 ml of a lysis buffer (138 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing 1% Triton X-100. The lysate was precipitated with a monoclonal antibody against Myc (9E10; Roche Applied Science), FLAG (M2, Sigma), or HA (16B12, Covance) in the presence of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After washing three times with the lysis buffer, the precipitant was applied to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was probed with anti-Myc polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG (M2) monoclonal antibody, or anti-aPKC rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were developed using ECL-plus (Amersham Biosciences) to visualize the antibodies. Protein Kinase Activity of the Wild-type and Mutant PKCι/λ—The protein kinase activity of PKCι/λ was determined using myelin basic protein as a substrate, according to the method of Yamanaka et al. (26Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Kitamura K. Maniwa R. Nagai Y. Yamashita A. Hirose T. Ishikawa H. Ohno S. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, COS-7 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged PKCι/λ(wt), PKCι/λ(D63A), or PKCι/λ(K274E). The cells were suspended at 4 °C for 30 min in a lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 250 mm sucrose, 1.2 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.8 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and the resultant supernatant was immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody preabsorbed on protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The precipitates were suspended in 30 μl of a phosphorylation buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5), and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 60 μl of a substrate mixture containing 1 μm myelin basic protein and 40 μm ATP (25 μCi/50 μl of [γ-32P]ATP). After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The products were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Localization of Par6α and PKCι/λ in MDCK Cells—Localization of Par6α and PKCι/λ was tested using canine kidney epithelial MDCK cells as described previously (28Kohjima M. Noda Y. Takeya R. Saito N. Takeuchi K. Sumimoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were transfected with pEF-BOS, which encodes the wild-type or mutant proteins of Par6α or PKCι/λ, using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were then incubated for 90 min in a Ca2+-free medium (S-MEM, Invitrogen). After replacing the medium with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, the cells were cultured for another 20 h. Following a wash with PBS, cells were fixed for 15 min in 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized for 10 min in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 60 min. The samples were initially incubated with either anti-HA (Y11) rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz) or anti-ZO-1 monoclonal antibody (37Takeuchi K. Sato N. Kasahara H. Funayama N. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and subsequently probed with both Alexa Fluor™ 594-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes) and Alexa Fluor™ 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes) as secondary antibodies. Images were visualized with an Axiovert 200M confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss). Alignment of the Amino Acid Sequences of PB1 Domains— The sequences of PB1 domains from various proteins are aligned in Fig. 1A on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of this module of Bem1p (7Terasawa H. Noda Y. Ito T. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3947-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The originally identified PB1 domains, e.g. those of p67 phox and Bem1p, lack an OPCA motif but harbor the conserved lysine residue on the first β-strand; Lys-355 of p67 phox and Lys-482 of Bem1p are crucial for the interaction with their target proteins (5Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 15Kuribayashi F. Nunoi N. Wakamatsu K. Tsunawaki S. Sato K. Ito T. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6312-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The lysine is replaced by arginine in a group of PB1 domains that possess the OPCA motif, such as those of Cdc24p, p40 phox , and MEK5 (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, the conserved lysine and OPCA motif are both presented on single PB1 domains of aPKC, Par6, and ZIP (Fig. 1A). It is known that aPKC-PB1 directly interacts with the N-terminal regions of Par6 (24Noda Y. Takeya R. Ohno S. Naito S. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and ZIP (5Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), each containing a PB1 domain (Fig. 1A). The roles of the lysine and OPCA motif presented on the same PB1 domain, however, have remained elusive. The PB1 Domain of Par6 Is Responsible for the Interaction with the PB1 Domain of aPKC— The polarity protein Par6 harbors a PDZ domain and a CRIB-like motif (Fig. 2A); the former participates in interaction with Par3 (23Lin D. Edwards A.S. Fawcett J.P. Mbamalu G. Scott J.D. Pawson T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the latter serves as a target for the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac in the GTP-bound state (21Qiu R.-G. Abo A. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 697-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 22Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Noda Y. Takeya R. Ohno S. Naito S. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Suzuki A. Yamanaka T. Hirose T. Manabe N. Mizuno K. Shimizu M. Akimoto K. Izumi Y. Ohishi T. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1183-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). It is also known that the N-terminal region of Par6α (amino acid residues 1–115) interacts directly with aPKC (24Noda Y. Takeya R. Ohno S. Naito S. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here we pinpointed the aPKC-interacting region using a series of deletion mutants of Par6α in the yeast two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig. 2A, the fragment comprising amino acid residues 14–95 of Par6α was essential and sufficient for the binding to PKCι/λ; further deletion from either end completely abolished the two-hybrid interaction. When PKCζ was used instead of PKCι/λ, essentially the same interactions were observed (data not shown). The minimally required region (residues 14–95) corresponds precisely to the PB1 domain predicted from the alignment of the module from various proteins (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, in an in vitro pull-down assay using purified proteins, GST-Par6α-(14–95) was precipitated efficiently with MBP-PKCι/λ-PB1 or MBP-PKCζ-PB1 but not with MBP alone (Fig. 2B). Thus the PB1 domain of Par6 seems to bind directly to the same module of aPKC. The Conserved Lysine in the Par6 PB1 Domain Is Crucial for the Interaction between Par6 and aPKC—As described above, the PB1 domain of Par6 harbors both the conserved lysine and OPCA motif, the latter of which includes the stretch DXXGD (X, any amino acid) (Fig. 1A). We first tested the role of the lysine, Lys-19 of Par6α, in the interaction with the PB1 domain of aPKC. The K19A substitution led to an impaired interaction with PKCι/λ (Fig. 2C) or with PKCζ (data not shown), as estimated in the yeast two-hybrid system. The role of Lys-19 was verified by an in vitro binding assay using purified PB1 domains and by an immunoprecipitation assay using mammalian cells expressing full-length proteins. As shown in Fig. 2D, the GST-fused PB1 domain of Par6α carrying the K19A substitution, GST-Par6α-PB1(K19A), was incapable of binding to MBP-PKCι/λ-PB1 or MBP-PKCζ-PB1 under the conditions where the wild-type Par6α-PB1 fully bound to aPKC. When full-length Par6α was expressed as a Myc-tagged protein in COS-7 cells, aPKC was co-immunoprecipitated with the wild-type Par6α(wt) but not with the mutant protein Par6α(K19A) (Fig. 2E). The K19A substitution does not appear to disturb the protein integrity because the mutant protein fully interacted with other targets, including the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac, and Par3 (data not shown). On the other hand, even when Asp-63, an invariant residue among the OPCA motif (Fig. 1A), was replaced by alanine, Par6α fully bound to aPKC (Fig. 2, C and E). In addition, the substitution of alanine for other conserved residues in the motif, such as Asp-67, Leu-69, and Ser-76, did not affect the interaction with aPKC (data not shown). Taken together, the binding of Par6 to aPKC is mediated via the conserved Lys-19 but not via the OPCA motif. The OPCA Motif in the aPKC PB1 Domain Plays an Essential Role in the Interaction between Par6 and aPKC—We next tested the function of the conserved lysine and OPCA motif in the PB1 domain of aPKC. The conserved lysines (Lys-20 in PKCι/λ, Lys-19 in PKCζ) do not seem to participate in the binding to Par6; their replacement by alanine did not affect the interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, the substitution of alanine for aspartates conserved in the OPCA motif of aPKC resulted in a complete loss of interaction with Par6α (Fig. 3, A and B), Par6β (data not shown), or Par6γ (data not shown). The same effect was also observed by using purified proteins and in cells expressing the full-length proteins; the PKCι/λ PB1 domain carrying the D63A substitution failed to interact with Par6 under the condition where the wild-type PKCι/λ-PB1 fully bound to Par6 (Fig. 3C). When expressed in COS-7 cells, the full-length PKCι/λ with the D63A substitution was i"
https://openalex.org/W2094277962,"PTEN tumor suppressor serves as a major negative regulator of survival signaling mediated by PI3 kinase/AKT/protein kinase B pathway, and is inactivated in various human tumors. Elucidation of mechanisms responsible for PTEN expression is important for providing insight into strategies to control the loss of PTEN expression in human cancers. Although recent studies suggested that p53 and Egr-1 can modulate induced PTEN expression, the mechanism responsible for ubiquitous constitutive expression of PTEN remains elusive. PTEN mRNA contains a highly conserved and GC-rich 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR). Recently, it has been shown that the long 5'-UTR sequences of several growth-regulated mRNAs contain promoters that can generate mRNAs with shorter 5'-UTRs. In this paper, we tested whether the 5'-UTR sequence of mouse PTEN contains a promoter that is responsible for constitutive expression of PTEN. We found that the long 5'-UTR sequence of mouse PTEN severely inhibits translation of PTEN and a heterologous gene firefly luciferase. Deletion of the most 5'-UTR sequence would enhance translation efficiency 100-fold. We also showed that the 5'-UTR sequence of mouse PTEN does not have an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that can mediate cap-independent initiation of translation. Instead, we found that the 5'-UTR sequence of mouse PTEN contains a strong promoter that drives the production of a transcript with shorter 5'-UTRs, which can be translated with higher efficiency. This promoter was mapped to the region between -551 and -220 bases upstream of the translation start codon. Cotransfection analysis using Drosophila SL2 cells showed that Sp1 is one of the major transcription factors that can constitutively activate this promoter. Two endogenous PTEN transcripts with 5'-UTRs of 193 and 109 bases were found in DU145 and H226 cell lines. Based on these observations, we conclude that the PTEN expression may be regulated at both transcriptional and translational levels, and that the 5'-UTR sequence of PTEN contains a promoter that is responsible for constitutive PTEN expression."
https://openalex.org/W2168072049,"In this report we show that in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> the flagellar switch, which controls direction of flagellar rotation based on levels of the chemotaxis primary response regulator, CheY-P, also causes hydrolysis of CheY-P to form CheY and P<sub>i</sub>. This task is performed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> by CheZ, which interestingly enough is primarily located at the receptors, not at the switch. In particular we have identified the phosphatase as FliY, which resembles <i>E. coli</i> switch protein FliN only in its C-terminal part, while an additional N-terminal domain is homologous to another switch protein FliM and to CheC, a protein found in the archaea and many bacteria but not in <i>E. coli</i>. Previous <i>E. coli</i> studies have localized the CheY-P binding site of the switch to FliM residues 6–15. These residues are almost identical to the residues 6–15 in both <i>B. subtilis</i> FliM and FliY. We were able to show that both of these proteins are capable of binding CheY-P <i>in vitro</i>. Deletion of this binding region in <i>B. subtilis</i> mutant <i>fliM</i> caused the same phenotype as a <i>cheY</i> mutant (clockwise flagellar rotation), whereas deletion of it in <i>fliY</i> caused the opposite. We showed that FliY increases the rate of CheY-P hydrolysis <i>in vitro</i>. Consequently, we imagine that the duration of enhanced CheY-P levels caused by activation of the CheA kinase upon attractant binding to receptors, is brief due both to adaptational processes and to phosphatase activity of FliY."
https://openalex.org/W2038818295,"In sarcomas, the TP53 tumour suppressor pathway may be altered either by TP53 mutations or by amplification of MDM2, encoding a protein that inhibits TP53 and targets it for 26S-proteasome degradation. However, in the majority of the analysed clinical samples, neither of these types of aberrations are found, suggesting that additional mechanisms are involved. The present study shows that COPS3, located in 17p11 and encoding a component of the proteasome pathway, is more frequently amplified in osteosarcomas (OS) than is MDM2. We present detailed analysis of TP53 mutations and MDM2 and COPS3 expression levels in a set of 23 OS. Our results show that none of the tumours with COPS3 amplification had MDM2 amplification nor TP53 mutations, consistent with the hypothesis that one of the three aberrations is sufficient. The results suggest that inactivation of otherwise intact TP53 by aberrations in the proteasome pathway may contribute to the characteristic aneuploidy observed in OS."

https://openalex.org/W2054169897,"Myopodin is a dual compartment protein that displays actin-bundling activity and redistributes between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a differentiation-dependent and stress-induced fashion. We evaluated myopodin expression in initiation and progression of bladder cancer. Normal urothelium expresses myopodin in the cytoplasm and nuclei. Invasive bladder tumors showed decreased nuclear myopodin expression as compared to superficial lesions. This loss of nuclear myopodin expression was significantly associated with histopathological stage, tumor grade and overall patient survival in bladder tumors contained in tissue microarrays. We identified a differential nuclear expression for myopodin among bladder cancer cell lines during cell-cycle. Myopodin was present in the nucleus during G1/S in cells derived from superficial and low-grade lesions but not in those derived from invasive tumors. Loss of nuclear myopodin expression could classify bladder tumors and bladder cancer cell lines based on their histopathology. Most importantly, patients with preserved nuclear myopodin expression showed a longer survival. Nuclear myopodin expression in the context of cell-cycle progression may prove useful for staging bladder tumors and suggest a tumor suppressor role of myopodin in bladder cancer."

Instead, it is suggested that the helical protrusion extending from the apical domain acts as a built-in lid for the central cavity and that the opening and closing of the lid is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. However, details of this conformational change remain unclear. To investigate the conformational change associated with the ATP-driven cycle, we conducted protease sensitivity analyses and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy of α-chaperonin from a hyperthermophilic archaeum, Thermococcus strain KS-1. In the nucleotide-free or ADP-bound state, the chaperonin, especially in the helical protrusion region, was highly sensitive to proteases. Addition of ATP and ammonium sulfate induced the transition to the relatively protease-resistant form. The fluorescence intensity of the tryptophan residue introduced at the tip of the helical protrusion was enhanced by the presence of ATP or ammonium sulfate. We conclude that ATP binding induces the conformational change from the lid-open to lid-closed form in archaeal group II chaperonin.

Chaperonins, one of the principal molecular chaperones, capture non-native proteins and promote folding in vivo and in vitro in an ATP-dependent manner. They form large cylindrical complexes composed of two stacked rings of 7–9 subunits, each about 60 kDa in size. There is a large cavity in the center of the complex, where unfolded proteins may be encapsulated and undergo productive folding (1Bukau B. Horwich A.L.

J. 1998; 333: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Based on protein sequence similarity and structural features, chaperonins are grouped into two subfamilies (3Kubota H. Hynes G.

Biol. 1999; 293: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Group I chaperonins are found in bacteria and eukaryotic organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts. The Escherichia coli chaperonin, GroEL, is the most extensively characterized member of the chaperonins. GroEL facilitates protein folding with a cofactor termed GroES in an ATP-dependent manner. GroES has two functions; it acts as a lid to cap the cavity of GroEL, and then induces the release of bound substrate protein into the GroEL-GroES cavity where it can undergo folding (5Kusmierczyk A.R. Martin J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The group II chaperonins are found in archaea (as thermosome) and in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells (as CCT or TRiC). 1The abbreviations used are: CCT, chaperonin-containing t-complex polypeptide-1; TRiC, TCP1-ring complex; T.

Group II chaperonins do not have a co-chaperonin corresponding to GroES. The crystal structure of the group II chaperonin from an acidothermophilic archaeum, Thermoplasma acidophilum, suggested that the function of GroES is replaced by long helical protrusions from the apical domain (6Klumpp M.

Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). These protrusions are thought to function as a “built-in lid” for the central cavity. Presumably, ATP binding drives group II chaperonins from the lid-open, substrate binding conformation, into the lid-closed conformation, where substrate folds within the central cavity (6Klumpp M.

However, the exact relationship between the nucleotide-bound state and the conformation is still controversial in group II chaperonins. Szpikowska et al. (10Szpikowska B.K. Swiderek K.M. Sherman M.A. Mas M.T. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1524-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) reported that CCT is more resistant to trypsin digestion at the apical domain in the presence of ATP than in the absence of nucleotide and the presence of AMP-PNP, and the AMP-PNP-bound form of CCT is trypsin-sensitive as is the nucleotide-free form. On the other hand, Llorca et al. (11Llorca O. Martin-Benito J. Grantham J. Ritco-Vonsovici M. Willison K.R. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4065-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) showed that the binding of AMP-PNP to CCT results in the cavity being closed off by the helical protrusions of the apical domains. Also, they showed that ATP induces an asymmetric structure; one of the rings in the conformation is similar to that of the nucleotide-free CCT, whereas the other presents a more open conformation (12Llorca O.

Holzinger J. Rauh N. Baumeister W. May R.P. J. Struct.

Using cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction, three conformational states were found in archaeal chaperonins, regardless of the presence of nucleotides; an open form, a closed form, and a bullet-shaped form with one open and one closed ring (15Schoehn G.

Although the natural chaperonin isolated from T. KS-1 is a hetero-oligomer, each of the recombinant α and β subunits forms a double-ring homo-oligomer and functions as a chaperonin in vitro (17Yoshida T. Yohda M. Iida T. Maruyama T. Taguchi H.

Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1406-1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent experimental results using β-chaperonin and natural chaperonin suggest that the protein folding occurs within the cis-cavity (21Yoshida T. Kawaguchi R. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. Yasunaga T. Wakabayashi T. Yohda M. Maruyama T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, details of conformational changes in the protein folding cycle of group II chaperonins remain unclear. In this report, we analyzed the protease sensitivity and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy of T. KS-1 α-chaperonins to study the conformational changes associated with the functional ATPase cycle. In the nucleotide-free or ADP-bound state, the chaperonin was highly sensitive to proteases. The amino acid sequences of the digested fragments suggested that the proteases firstly attacked the helical protrusions, which composed the built-in lid. Addition of ATP induced the transition to the relatively protease-resistant form. The fluorescence intensity of the introduced tryptophan residue was enhanced by the addition of ATP and AMP-PNP. The findings support the notion that ATP binding induces conformational change from an open to closed state in archaeal group II chaperonin. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Reagents, and Buffers—The E. coli strains used in this study were DH5α for plasmid preparation and BL21(DE3) for protein expression. The plasmids pK1Eα2 and pK1Eα1–4 were used as a template for mutagenesis and for expression of αWT and αG65S, respectively (18Yoshida T. Yohda M. Iida T. Maruyama T. Taguchi H. Yazaki K. Ohta T.

Nucleotides and thermolysin were purchased from Wako Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). Other reagents or enzymes used were of the biochemical research grade. The assay buffer used in this work is TNM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 25 mm MgCl2) or TKM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 25 mm MgCl2), with exceptions specially described. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The tryptophan mutants were constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strata-gene, CA). The 30-nucleotide primers 5′-CCAGCCCGGACCAGTGGATGAGCTTCCTTG-3′ and 5′-CAAGGAAGCTCATCCACTGGTCCGGGCTGG-3′ (mutated nucleotides are underlined), containing a cleavage site of FokI, were used for the codon substitution, CTC to TGG (Leu to Trp) on pK1Eα2 or pK1Eα1–4. The mutants were selected by FokI digestion and were confirmed by DNA sequencing. DNA manipulation was carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Purification of Chaperonins—The α-chaperonins of wild and mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with expression plasmids. They were cultured aerobically in 2xYT medium (16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl per liter) containing 75 μg/ml kanamycin. The harvested cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and disrupted by sonication. The suspension of disrupted cells was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and MgCl2, glycerol, and dithiothreitol (DTT) were added to the supernatant to 25 mm, 5% (v/v), and 1 mm, respectively. The cell extract was then subjected to heat treatment at 70 °C for 30 min, and denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation (25,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 25 mm MgCl2) containing 5% (v/v) glycerol and 1 mm DTT. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing the chaperonins were collected and dialyzed and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centriprep YM-10, Millipore, MA). The proteins were loaded onto an UNO Q6 column (Bio-Rad, CA) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl. The concentrated fractions containing α-chaperonins were loaded onto a gel filtration column (HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 prep grade, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. Purified chaperonins were concentrated by ultrafiltration, supplemented with glycerol to 20% (v/v), and stored at -80 °C. Examination for Nucleotide Contamination—The purified chaperonins were shown to be nucleotide-free by the following procedure. The purified proteins were denatured with ice-cold perchloric acid and then centrifuged to remove proteins. Aliquots of the supernatant were applied to a TSK ODS-80Ts column (4.6 mm × 15 cm, Tosoh) equilibrated with 30 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 2% (v/v) acetonitrile. The eluate was monitored with an on-line UV spectrophotometer at 259 nm (Waters Alliance high-performance liquid chromatography system, Tokyo, Japan). Proteolysis of α Subunit Chaperonins and N-terminal Sequencing— The α-chaperonin (50 or 250 nm) was incubated with or without nucleotide (to a final concentration of 1 mm) at 65 °C for 5 min, being continuously stirred. Proteolytic digestion was carried out with thermolysin (1 ng/μl) or proteinase K (40 ng/μl) at 65 °C for 10 or 5 min. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was precipitated using 30% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and placed on ice for more than 5 min. The precipitate was centrifuged and subjected to SDS-PAGE after a wash with ice-cold water. Proteinase K-digested protein obtained by trichloroacetic acid-precipitation was subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blotted membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The bands were excised and analyzed with a peptide sequencer. Fluorescence Measurements—The fluorescence spectra of tryptophan mutants were measured at 65 °C with a spectrofluorometer, RF-5300PC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm, and emission was recorded from 300 to 450 nm (band-width = 1.5 nm for excitation and 3.0 nm for emission). α-Chaperonin (250 nm) was preincubated with or without nucleotide (1 mm) for 5 min at 65 °C, and the mixture was stirred throughout the measurement. All spectra obtained were the average of five scans. Miscellaneous Methods—Proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis either on 10% (w/v) or 15% (w/v) SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) or on 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels without SDS (native-PAGE). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Protein concentrations were measured using a commercial kit, Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, CA) with bovine serum albumin as the standard (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The Absence of Potassium Ion Inhibits ATP Hydrolysis and Protein Folding Activity by αWT—The structural changes of chaperonin in the protein folding cycle are controlled by ATP binding and subsequent hydrolysis. Generally, potassium ion is required for efficient chaperonin-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis (27Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 28Gutsche I. Mihalache O. Baumeister W. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of ATP by αWT was also highly dependent on the presence of potassium ion. When potassium ion is replaced by sodium ion, the ATPase activity of αWT decreases by a factor of about 6 (data not shown). Consistently, the protein folding activity of αWT also dropped significantly in the absence of potassium ion as observed in the GFP refolding experiment (data not shown). Multiple rounds of binding, hydrolysis, and release of nucleotides, which are required for efficient refolding of GFP, are hindered in the absence of potassium ion. Thus, we expected the chaperonin conformation to be fixed in the ATP-bound state using potassium free buffer. At Least Two Conformational States Exist in αWT—Figs. 1 and 2 show the SDS-PAGE analyses of protease-treated αWT and αG65S. αWT was subjected to thermolysin digestion with or without nucleotides in the TNM and TKM buffer (Fig. 1A). In the presence of ATP or AMP-PNP, a non-hydrolyzable analogue of ATP, αWT was relatively thermolysin-resistant, and polypeptides of about 60 kDa, probably intact α subunit polypeptides, remained irrespective of the presence of potassium ion. In contrast, 60-kDa polypeptides were degraded nearly completely in the absence of nucleotide or the presence of ADP. Intriguingly, the αWT complex digested with thermolysin retained its quaternary structure and was able to capture denatured GFP but did not exhibit ATP-dependent folding activity (data not shown). These results are fully consistent with the previous findings for CCT (10Szpikowska B.K. Swiderek K.M. Sherman M.A. Mas M.T. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1524-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in the experiments using proteinase K (Fig. 1B). In the presence of potassium ion, ATP was not effective in protecting the chaperonin from protease K compared with the digestion by thermolysin (Fig. 1, A and B). We speculate that the difference is caused by the excess amount of protease K (ratio of chaperonin/protease K, 6/1 (w/w)). The digestion might have proceeded in the protease-sensitive state during the ATP hydrolysis cycle.Fig. 2Protease resistance of αWT and αG65C induced by high concentration of sulfate ion. A, αWT and αG65C were preincubated with or without 1 mm of the different nucleotides (ATP, AMP-PNP, and ADP) at 65 °C for 5 min, and then thermolysin was added to the chaperonin solution. Incubation proceeded in TNM buffer containing 1.2 m ammonium sulfate. The detailed procedures are described under “Materials and Methods.” Lane M, molecular weight marker; lane W, αWT; lane F, nucleotide- and ammonium sulfate-free form of αWT; lanes 1 and 5, without addition of nucleotide; lanes 2 and 6, incubated with ATP; lanes 3 and 7, incubated with AMP-PNP; lanes 4 and 8, incubated with ADP. B, αG65C was preincubated with or without 1 mm ATP at 65 °C for 5 min, and then thermolysin was added to the chaperonin solution. Incubation proceeded in TNM buffer without or with 1.2 m salt (ammonium sulfate, sodium sulfate, and ammonium chloride). The detailed procedures are described under “Materials and Methods.” Lane M, molecular weight marker; lane C, αG65C; lane 1, without addition of nucleotide; lane 2, incubated with ATP; lane 3, incubated with 1.2 m ammonium sulfate; lane 4, incubated with 1.2 m ammonium sulfate and ATP; lane 5, incubated with 1.2 m sodium sulfate; lane 6, incubated with 1.2 m sodium sulfate and ATP; lane 7, incubated with 1.2 m ammonium chloride; and lane 8, incubated with 1.2 m ammonium chloride and ATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Then, the same protease digestion experiments were performed using αG65S (Fig. 1, C and D). The mutant is fixed in the protease-sensitive state irrespective of nucleotide species and potassium ion. In this mutant, the loss of protein-folding activity is likely to be due to the absence of ATP-dependent conformational change (20Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Maruyama T. Shomura Y. Miki K. Yohda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Proteinase K-digested fragments of αWT were subjected to amino acid sequencing to determine the sites of cleavage (Table I). Fragment B, Fragment E, and a part of Fragment D were produced by digestion in the helical protrusion. It is thought that Fragment C was produced after proteinase K invaded into the central cavity based on the crystal structure of T. KS-1 chaperonin. 2Y. Shomura, T. Yoshida, R. Iizuka, T. Marayama, M. Yohda, and K. Miki, manuscript in preparation. The region adjacent to Fragment F is so exposed to the bulk solution that it is labile. Thus, the helical protrusion in the apical domain was the area most susceptible to proteolysis in the entire structure. Therefore, the changes in protease sensitivity caused by ATP and AMP-PNP would be due to a conformational change of the helical protrusion.Table IAssignment of α WT-derived fragments based on amino acid sequencingsFragmentAssignmentLocationBLeu269-Glu273Helical protrusionCArg18-Leu27Equatorial domainTyr19-Asn28Val20-Ile29Asp23-Ala12DLys87-Gly96Equatorial domainAsp90-Thr99Lys274-Ile283Helical protrusionELeu269-Glu273Helical protrusionFVal146-Asp150Intermediate domainAAla1-Asn5Proteinase K Open table in a new tab Previously, we have determined the crystal structure of the mutant αG65C/I125T, 2Y.

Yohda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Whereas this mutant lacks an ability to refold the captured non-native proteins in the presence of ATP, the crystal structure obtained in ammonium sulfate solution indicated that it takes the closed conformation, with the helical protrusions in both rings pointing toward the center of the cavity. Then, the protease digestion experiment was performed in the presence of 1.2 m ammonium sulfate. Both thermolysin and proteinase K were active even in the presence of such a high concentration of ammonium sulfate (data not shown). Both the wild type and αG65C were highly resistant to cleavage under these conditions irrespective of the nucleotides (Fig. 2A). It was shown that sodium sulfate has almost the same effect as ammonium sulfate, but ammonium chloride does not (Fig. 2B). A small angle neutron scattering study also suggested that Thermoplasma chaperonin takes the closed conformation in the presence of a high concentration of sulfate (29Gutsche I. Holzinger J. Rossle M. Heumann H. Baumeister W. May R.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 405-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded that a high concentration of sulfate ion induced the conformational change of wild type and mutant proteins to the protease-resistant form, probably the closed conformation. Tryptophan Fluorescence Enhancement Associated with ATP Binding—To examine the movement of the helical protrusion during the functional cycle further, we constructed mutants, αL265W and αG65S/L265W. The target residue for replacement with tryptophan, leucine 265, is located at the tip of the helical protrusion. 2Y. Shomura, T. Yoshida, R. Iizuka, T. Marayama, M. Yohda, and K. Miki, manuscript in preparation. The fluorescence spectrum of α-chaperonin was almost flat due to the lack of tryptophan residues (data not shown). Thus, by monitoring the fluorescence of the mutants, a change in the local environment around the tip of the helical protrusion would be elucidated. Both mutants could capture acid-denatured GFP and heat-denatured citrate synthase. αL265W was able to facilitate the refolding of GFP in an ATP-dependent manner despite the fact that the yield was less than half that of αWT. Protease experiments showed that αL265W also took a protease-resistant conformation on binding ATP (data not shown). These results indicated that αL265W has the ability to undergo the same ATP-induced conformational changes as αWT. αG65S/L265W exhibited similar functional and structural characteristics to αG65S (data not shown). Fig. 3 (A and B) shows the fluorescence spectra of αL265W under various conditions. The addition of ATP caused a large enhancement (about 68%) of tryptophan fluorescence intensity in both buffers. Although the changes to the maximal emission wavelength were only marginal (Table II), there seemed to be a significant change in the environment around Trp-265 associated with ATP. The fluorescence change in αL265W induced by AMP-PNP in TKM buffer was smaller than that in TNM buffer. It correlates well with the difference of protease sensitivity in the presence of AMP-PNP with and without potassium ion (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, no detectable change was induced by the addition of ADP under either set of conditions. Also, the presence of ammonium sulfate resulted in a significant enhancement of fluorescence (Table II). Fig. 3 (C and D) shows the fluorescence spectra of αG65S/L265W. When ATPase activity was suppressed in the TNM buffer, the fluorescence intensity of αG65S/L265W decreased in the presence of ATP and AMP-PNP. The effect of AMP-PNP was unchanged in the presence of potassium ion. Although the fluorescence intensity of αG65S/L265W was increased by the hydrolysis of ATP, the change was smaller than that for αL265W. As was the case for αL265W, the presence of ammonium sulfate substantially enhanced the fluorescence intensity (Table II).Table IIFluorescence parameters of αL265W and αG65S/L265WMaximum of Trp fluorescenceFluorescence at emission maximum arbitrary unitsnmarbitrary unitsαL265W, without potassium ionNucleotide-free3445.89+ ATP3439.94+ AMP-PNP3439.72+ ADP3445.86+ 1.2 m ammonium sulfate3439.26+ 1.2 m ammonium sulfate and ATP34210.3αL265W, with potassium ionNucleotide-free3445.59+ ATP3439.43+ AMP-PNP3446.60+ ADP3445.41+ 1.2 m ammonium sulfate3429.19+ 1.2 m ammonium sulfate and ATP34210.0αG65S/L265W, without potassium ionNucleotide-free3516.32+ ATP3445.77+ AMP-PNP3435.24+ ADP3446.41+ 1.2 m ammonium sulfate34210.8+ 1.2 m ammonium sulfate and ATP34213.3αG65S/L265W, with potassium ionNucleotide-free3446.38+ ATP3437.51+ AMP-PNP3445.37+ ADP3446.64+ 1.2 m ammonium sulfate34213.2+ 1.2 m ammonium sulfate and ATP34211.1 Open table in a new tab Model of the Functional Cycle of T. KS-1 α Subunit Chaperonin—The protease digestion experiments and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopic studies presented above clearly demonstrate the following structural characteristics of archaeal group II chaperonins. First, ATP induces a striking structural change to αWT and αL265W irrespective of potassium ion. In the nucleotide-free or ADP-bound state, the chaperonin was highly sensitive to proteases. Addition of ATP induced a change to the relatively protease-resistant form (Figs. 1 and 2). The fluorescence intensity of αL265W was enhanced by the addition of ATP (Fig. 3). So, it is concluded that α-chaperonin undergoes a large conformational change in the presence of magnesium ion and ATP and that the hydrolysis of ATP is dispensable for this change. The amino acid sequences of the digested fragments suggested that the proteases first attacked the helical protrusion region, which composes the built-in lid (Table I). It seems that this region is very flexible in the nucleotide-free and ADP-bound state, and ATP or AMP-PNP binding induces a transition to a rigid state. Based on the GFP refolding assay, the change of tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 3), and the crystal structure, 2Y. Shomura, T. Yoshida, R. Iizuka, T. Marayama, M. Yohda, and K. Miki, manuscript in preparation. we concluded that the conformational change induced by binding ATP brings about the closure of built-in lid, which would be critical for protein folding. It was shown that the conformation of CCT bound to α-actin and β-tubulin in the presence of AMP-PNP is similar to that of the thermosome x-ray structure (11Llorca O. Martin-Benito J. Grantham J. Ritco-Vonsovici M. Willison K.R. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4065-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast, αG65S does not exhibit significant conformational change. The lack of protein folding activity by the mutant would be caused by the loss of conformational change in the ATP hydrolysis cycle. Second, sulfate ion fixes both αWT and αG65S in a state highly homologous to that of αWT bound to ATP. Gutsche et al. (29Gutsche I. Holzinger J. Rossle M. Heumann H. Baumeister W. May R.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 405-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) pointed out that high ammonium sulfate conditions induce the closed conformation, based on a small angle neutron scattering study. Although αG65 mutants are fixed in the lid-open state, the crystal structure of the mutant α-chaperonin was determined to be a closed form. The contradiction would be explained by the fact that the crystallization buffer included a high concentration of ammonium sulfate. 2Y. Shomura, T. Yoshida, R. Iizuka, T. Marayama, M. Yohda, and K. Miki, manuscript in preparation. Third, the conformations in the nucleotide-free state and the ADP-bound state are the same or very similar to each other. This is consistent with previous results of electron microscopy and small angle neutron scattering measurement showing that the binding of ADP does not induce a major change in structure among group II chaperonins (12Llorca O.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) pointed out that there are large differences between ADP-AlF4--CCT, corresponding to the state of transition of ATP hydrolysis, and ADP-CCT in electron microscopic images and hydrodynamic properties. Fig. 4 is a schematic model for the conformational change to αWT induced by ATP binding and hydrolysis based on the above. It is thought that αWT is in a lid-closed state, which results in the promotion of protein folding, following binding with the non-native protein and ATP. Judging from the above results, it could be expected that the binding of ATP to αG65S doesn't lead to the conformation with the built-in lid closed. Gutsche et al. (14Gutsche I. Holzinger J. Rauh N. Baumeister W. May R.P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) suggested that the interaction of the thermosome with ATP is at least a two-step process and that the thermosome would be an open toroidal complex similar to ATP-bound GroEL in the first step. The fluorescence intensity of αG65S/L265W decreased when ATP and AMP-PNP were present in TNM buffer. Although the reason for the decrease is not clear, the intermediate form, mentioned above, may exist before the lid-closed form. If this is the case, the possibility exists that the conformational changes stop during this intermediate state, at least when there is no substrate. Because the actions of the ADP-bound form are very similar to that of the nucleotide-free form, both are considered to be nearly the same structure. It is thought that the inorganic phosphate released by ATP hydrolysis causes α-chaperonin to return to the open conformation. Recently, Meyer et al. (31Meyer A.S. Gillespie J.R. Walther D. Millet I.S. Doniach S. Frydman J. Cell. 2003; 113: 369-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) have shown that the lid closure of CCT is induced not by the binding but by the hydrolysis of ATP. Their results clearly show that no conformational change occurs in the presence of AMP-PNP. They explained that the discrepancy between their results and previous observations using archaeal chaperonins results from ATP contamination of the AMP-PNP. We have also found that the AMP-PNP and ADP used in this study were contaminated with less than 1 and 2% of ATP, respectively. But, the conformational change would not be caused by the ATP hydrolysis, because it occurred even under the conditions where the hydrolysis of ATP was restricted. The discrepancy might be explained by the structural difference between CCT and archaeal chaperonins."

Although exogenously expressed TAp73 proteins transactivate endogenous targets of p53, several lines of evidence indicate that in vivo p53 and p73 may be differentially regulated and carry out specialized, non-overlapping functions. Indeed, p73- and p63-deficient mice exhibit specific phenotypes related to abnormal differentiation of brain and skin, respectively, but do not show defects related to spontaneous or x-ray-induced apoptosis during embryogenesis, nor do they develop spontaneous cancers (9.Mills A.A.

Second, p53 is induced in response to a variety of DNA-damaging agents and cellular stressors, whereas p73 is induced only by a subset of agents, including cisplatin, doxorubicin, and irradiation, in a p53-independent/c-abl-dependent manner (12.Agami R.

Finally, the specificity of p73 proteins role in the apoptotic response to DNA damage is further underlined by the recent evidence that p73 is required for p53-dependent apoptosis induced by DNA damage (15.Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Crowley D. Sengupta S. Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T.

In addition, p73 mediates T-cell receptor activation-induced cell death (TCR-AICD), a p53-independent apoptotic process that occurs in mature peripheral T cells (16.Lissy N.A. Davis P.K. Irwin M.

Thus, p73 and p53 act through specific and distinctive pathways, although some of their functions clearly overlap. p73 proteins are regulated both at the transcriptional level and by post-translational modifications in different cellular and pathophysiological contexts. The p73 gene has been reported to be transcriptionally regulated by the transcription factor E2F1 in apoptosis induced by E2F1 overexpression (17.Stiewe T. Putzer B.M. Nat.

More recently, it has been also reported that p73 interacts physically with various cyclins in vitro, including cyclins A, B, D, and E, and that multiple p73 isoforms are phosphorylated by CDK1- and CDK2-containing complexes at threonine 86; however, the physiological relevance of these interactions in vivo has not yet been clearly established (32.Gaiddon C.

Here we show that p73 is a target of the p34cdc2-cyclin B mitotic kinase complex in vivo. Both p73β and p73α isoforms are hyperphosphorylated during physiological mitosis and during mitotic arrest induced by microtubule-targeting drugs. p34cdc2-cyclin B phosphorylates and associates with p73 in vivo, which results in a decreased ability of p73 to both bind DNA and activate transcription in mitotic cells. This is associated with p73 detachment from condensed chromosomes and redistribution throughout the mitotic cytoplasm in meta- and anaphase.

Histone H1, nocodazole, paclitaxel (taxol), propidium iodide, hydroxyurea, and olomoucine were purchased from Sigma. Ponasterone A was from Alexis Biochemical, Inc. Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitations, and Kinase Assays—Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described (13.Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

For p34cdc2-cyclin B1 kinase assay, immunoprecipitates and purified GST fusion proteins were incubated in kinase buffer (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, and 15 μCi of [γ-32 P]ATP in the presence of 20 units of highly purified recombinant p34cdc2-cyclin B complex (New England Biolabs). The reaction was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by adding 10 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer. Samples were resolved through 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and analyzed by autoradiography. For pull-down assays, 2 μg of either immobilized purified GST fusion proteins or wild-type GST were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of 0.5 μg of a 55-kDa full-length p34cdc2 fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli (Santa Cruz). After 6 washes in radioimmune precipitation buffer, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-p34cdc2 antibody. Binding to Biotinylated Oligonucleotides—200 ng of biotinylated oligonucleotides encompassing the p53-binding sites of the p21 promoter were immobilized to Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Dynal, AS, Oslo, Norway) and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of in vitro translated (TnT, Promega) p73α and p73α-T86A proteins. After three washes, oligonucleotide-bound p73 proteins were incubated in 20 μl of kinase buffer with (20 units) or without highly purified recombinant Cdc2-cyclin B complex (New England Biolabs). Where indicated the p34cdc2-cyclin B complex was preincubated with 0.5 mm olomoucine for 10 min at room temperature. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, oligonucleotide-bound p73 proteins were washed twice and resolved through 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and analyzed using the 1288 anti-p73 antibody. Cytological Preparations and Microscopy—Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies against p73 (1:100, Imgenex) and p53 (1:200, Dako) γ-tubulin (3.5 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% fetal calf serum) followed by Texas Red- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody (800-fold dilution in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% fetal calf serum) before counterstaining in 0.1 μg/ml DAPI. Images were analyzed using an Olympus AX70 microscope configured for epifluorescence and equipped with a cooled camera device (Photometrics). p73α and -β Are Phosphorylated during Mitosis—As a first step toward extending our current knowledge of p73 regulation during the cell cycle (see the Introduction and references therein), we examined p73 steady state levels in cells that were drug-synchronized in different cell cycle phases. As shown in Fig. 1A, the amount of both p73α and -β isoforms increases in S phase-enriched cultures as compared with exponentially growing asynchronous cells (Fig. 1A, compare nt and S in rows a and b). The increase in p73 parallels the increase in E2F1 protein levels, consistent with the notion that p73 is regulated by E2F1 during G1/S progression (18.Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). p73 protein levels decrease in cells progressing from S into the G2 phase (Fig. 1A, compare lanes S and G2 in rows a and b). In nocodazole-arrested M phase cells, p73β levels increase, and both p73α and p73β isoforms display a slower electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1A, lane M in rows a and b). λ-Phosphatase treatment shifted the migration of mitotic p73α back to that of its interphase counterpart (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 1 and 2), indicating that p73 proteins are modified by phosphorylation in nocodazole-treated cells. To establish whether p73 phosphorylation observed in nocodazole-arrested cells reflected a mitotic specific modification, we separated mitotic from interphase cells by vigorous shaking and found that p73 hyperphosphorylation was confined to mitotic cells and was absent in culture samples that remained adherent and were enriched in G2 phase cells (Fig. 1C, left panel). Both p73α and -β displayed a similar mobility shift in taxol-treated cells (Fig. 1C, middle panel); thus, p73 phosphorylation was associated with mitotic arrest, irrespective of the drug specificity in the mechanism of action. Most importantly, p73 shift was also observed in mitotic cells collected by “shake-off” from an asynchronous population of untreated HCT116(3) cells (Fig. 1C, right panel). Similar results were obtained in human HeLa and breast cancer MCF7 cells (data not shown). Overall these results indicate that p73α and -β are subjected to mitosis-specific phosphorylation, both during the physiological mitotic division and during the mitotic arrest induced by microtubule-targeting drugs. p73 Is Phosphorylated by the p34cdc2-Cyclin B Complex in Vivo and in Vitro—p34cdc2-cyclin B is the key regulator of mitosis and is the kinase complex responsible for the G2/M transition. A number of proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, including RNA PolII, the basal factor TFIID (transcription factor IID), and several sequence-specific transcription factors, are subjected to mitosis-specific phosphorylation, which in most cases is performed by the cdc2-cyclin B kinase (see Ref. 36.Gottesfeld J.M. Forbes D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 197-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar for review). To test whether p34cdc2-cyclin B is involved in p73 mitotic phosphorylation, we first carried out an in vitro kinase assays using a highly purified p34cdc2-cyclin B complex. This complex efficiently phosphorylates histone H1, indicating that its activity is maintained in vitro (data not shown). p34cdc2-cyclin B complex phosphorylates a bacterially expressed GST-p73α fusion protein (Fig. 2A, left panel). In addition, we found that endogenous p73α protein immunoprecipitated from HCT116(3) cells acts as an efficient phosphorylation substrate of p34cdc2-cyclin B, contrary to IKKα protein immunoprecipitated from the same cultures (Fig. 2A, right panel). These results therefore identify p34cdc2-cyclinB as the candidate kinase that phosphorylates p73 in vivo during mitosis. By assaying several p73α deletion mutants expressed as GST fusion proteins (depicted in Fig. 2C) in an in vitro phosphorylation assay, we found that the amino-terminal region of p73 (residues 1–120) is targeted by p34cdc2-cyclin B phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, left panel). This region contains a single TPEH sequence matching the consensus Ser/Thr-Pro-X-basic amino acid phosphorylation site for p34cdc2 (37.Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) with the potentially phosphorylated threonine in position 86. We found that a T86A substitution in the GST-p73α-(1–120) fusion protein abolished phosphorylation by p34cdc2-cyclin B (Fig. 2D, left panel), consistent with results recently reported by Gaiddon et al. (32.Gaiddon C. Lokshin M. Gross I. Levasseur D. Taya Y. Loeffler J.P. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27421-27431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To assess the physiological relevance of these findings exogenous HA-tagged T86A-p73α, which cannot be phosphorylated by p34cdc2 in vitro, was expressed in cell cultures subjected to nocodazole synchronization. No electrophoretic variation was detected (Fig. 2D, right panel), indicating that no other phosphorylation event contributes to the M phase-specific pattern of p73 migration observed in vivo (see Fig. 1A). These results indicate that p73 is an in vivo target of phosphorylation by p34cdc2-cyclin B on threonine 86. p34cdc2-Cyclin B1 Complex Binds p73 in Mitosis—Several p73 isoforms have been shown to interact with purified cyclin-Cdk complexes in vitro (32.Gaiddon C. Lokshin M. Gross I. Levasseur D. Taya Y. Loeffler J.P. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27421-27431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because in vivo p73 displays an obvious susceptibility to modifications during mitosis (see Fig. 1), we next asked whether p73 and the p34cdc2-cyclin B complex do associate physically in vivo. As shown in Fig. 3A, p34cdc2 immunoprecipitates from asynchronously growing HCT116(3) cells contained p73α. It is noteworthy that the amount of coassociated p73α was significantly higher in p34cdc2 immunoprecipitates from nocodazole-arrested cells compared with asynchronously growing cultures (Fig. 3A), further indicating that p73 does associate with p34cdc2-cyclin B complex during mitosis. The association of p73 with p34cdc2 was followed up during mitotic exit and re-entry into G1 after release from nocodazole arrest (Fig. 3B). Levels of p34cdc2-cyclin B were down-regulated, as expected. In parallel, we observed a progressive reduction in the amount of p34cdc2-associated p73α at 6 h after nocodazole release; when all cells were beyond mitosis and into G1 phase, p34cdc2-p73α association was barely detectable (Fig. 3B). To assess whether the association between p73 and p34cdc2-cyclin B observed in vivo was direct or mediated by other cellular proteins, we performed pull-down experiments using a panel of GST-p73 fusion proteins and a commercial 55-kDa full-length p34cdc2 fusion protein produced in E. coli. p34cdc2 efficiently binds to GST-p73α and GST-p73β (Fig. 3C), and the association is maintained only with the GST p73-(1–120) deletion mutant (Fig. 3C). Together these results demonstrate that p73 associates directly with p34cdc2-cyclin B complex through the amino-terminal region of p73 and the association is physiologically established in vivo. p34cdc2-Cyclin B-mediated Phosphorylation Interferes with p73 Functions—Although mitosis is accompanied by a global repression of nuclear RNA synthesis in higher eukaryotes, increasing evidence indicate that some genes are stably transcribed even in the context of the highly condensed mitotic chromatin. Indeed, the human cyclin B1 gene itself is actively transcribed during mitosis (38.Sciortino S. Gurtner A. Manni I. Fontemaggi G. Dey A. Sacchi A. Ozato K. Piaggio G. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To assess the impact of p34cdc2-cyclin B-mediated phosphorylation on p73 transcriptional activity in vivo, we co-transfected the HA-p73α, HA-p34cdc2, and Myc-cyclin B expression vectors together with a luciferase reporter gene driven by the p53–73-responsive p21 promoter. p73-mediated transcriptional activation of the p21 promoter was reduced by 50% when p73 was co-transfected with either HA-p34cdc2 alone or with HA-p34cdc2 and Myc-cyclin B (Fig. 4A). The nonphosphorylatable p73-T86A mutant retained a somewhat lower ability to activate p21 promoter-driven transcription, which was not affected by co-transfection of HAp34cdc2 alone or with Myc-cyclin B (Fig. 4A). Transcriptional repression is thought to reflect both the increased condensation of mitotic chromatin (39.Martinez-Balbas M.A. Dey A. Rabindran S.K. Ozato K. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation events that inhibit the binding of transcriptional activators to their cognate DNA target (36.Gottesfeld J.M. Forbes D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 197-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). However, the mitotic dispersal of RNA polymerase II factors and sequence-specific transcription factors from the condensed mitotic chromosomes is not general. For example, AP2 (39.Martinez-Balbas M.A. Dey A. Rabindran S.K. Ozato K. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and NF-Y (38.Sciortino S. Gurtner A. Manni I. Fontemaggi G. Dey A. Sacchi A. Ozato K. Piaggio G. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), serum response factor p67SRF (40.Gauthier-Rouviere C. Cavadore J.C. Blanchard J.M. Lamb N.J. Fernandez A. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and a significant proportion of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factor 250 (TAFII250) (41.Chen D. Hinkley C.S. Henry R.W. Huang S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) remain associated with the condensed and transcriptionally inactive mitotic chromatin. To assess whether mitotic p34cdc2-cyclin B-dependent phosphorylation of p73 interferes with its DNA binding ability, we tested the effect of purified active p34cdc2-cyclin B on preassembled DNA-protein complexes containing in vitro translated p73 and a biotinylated p73-binding oligonucleotide from the p21 promoter. As shown in Fig. 4B, the amount of p73α bound to its cognate site was drastically reduced in the presence of purified active p34cdc2-cyclin B (compare lane 2 with lane 3). The amount of oligonucleotide-bound p73α remained instead unchanged when the pre-assembled DNA-protein complexes were incubated with p34cdc2-cyclin B preincubated with 0.5 μm olomoucine, a specific inhibitor of the p34cdc2 mitotic kinase (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 4 and 3). Thus, the reduced affinity of p73 for its DNA target sites is indeed mediated by p34cdc2 kinase activity. To further demonstrate that p34cdc2-cyclin B-mediated phosphorylation of p73 was responsible for its reduced DNA binding ability, the same experiment was performed using the in vitro translated p73-T86A mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated by p34cdc2-cyclin B. In these experiments, the amount of p73-T86A bound to p21-specific oligonucleotides was unchanged even in the presence of active p34cdc2-cyclin B (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 7, 8, and 9), consistent with the finding that Thr86 is the key p73 phosphorylation site during mitosis. To assess whether p34cdc2-cyclin B-dependent reduction in the DNA binding ability of p73 is reflected by displacement from mitotic chromatin in vivo, we studied p73 localization both in MCF7 (Fig. 5A) and H1299-derived p73α ponasterone A-inducible cells (Fig. 5B). Interphasic cells display a homogenous p73 nuclear staining that colocalizes with DAPI-stained chromatin and is excluded from nucleoli (Fig. 5, A, row a, and B, row a). In the metaphase and anaphase stages, both endogenous and inducible p73 are excluded from condensed chromosomes (Fig. 5, A, row b, and B, rows c and d). The mitotic localization of p73 differs from that of p53, which is associated with centrosomes in mitosis (Ref. 42.Ciciarello M. Mangiacasale R. Casenghi M. Zaira Limongi M. D'Angelo M. Soddu S. Lavia P. Cundari E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19205-19213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar and Fig. 5C, row a). Differential Behavior of p73 and p53 in Response to Spindle Damage—The association of p53 with centrosomes during normal mitosis is disrupted by nocodazole treatment (Ref. 42.Ciciarello M. Mangiacasale R. Casenghi M. Zaira Limongi M. D'Angelo M. Soddu S. Lavia P. Cundari E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19205-19213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar and Fig. 5C, row b) and is not re-established in cells that achieve mitotic exit after transient exposure to nocodazole. p53 delocalization and prolonged activation are responsible for the G1 block that follows the removal of the spindle-damaging agent (42.Ciciarello M. Mangiacasale R. Casenghi M. Zaira Limongi M. D'Angelo M. Soddu S. Lavia P. Cundari E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19205-19213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We asked whether p73 localization would also be affected by nocodazole. As shown in Fig. 5B (row e), p73 remained excluded from chromatin in nocodazole-arrested prometaphase cells. The exclusion of p73 from chromatin during nocodazole induced mitotic block, together with its reduced DNA binding activity, is expected to result in a reduction of p73 transcriptional activity. Indeed, ponasterone A-induced p73 cells accumulated in mitosis by nocodazole, despite a level of p73 induction similar to that of untreated cells, showed a lower ability to up-regulate p21 (Fig. 6A). When the same experiment was performed in the p53 H1299-derived cell line, the induced p53 retained its intact transcriptional activity, as reflected by p21 protein levels in nocodazole-treated cells (Fig. 6B). The latter result suggests that some of the p53 delocalized from centrosomes is transcriptionally active in nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells. Together these findings suggest that p73 phosphorylation by cdc2-cyclin B and dispersal from mitotic chromatin contribute to down-regulate its transcriptional potential. Conclusions—It is becoming increasingly clear that p53 and p73, despite their similarities in both primary amino acid sequence and DNA binding properties, execute partially overlapping, yet distinct functions (for review see Levrero et al. (2.Levrero M. De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Gong J. Wang J.Y. Melino G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1661-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Strano et al. (3.Strano S. Rossi M. Fontemaggi G. Munarriz E. Soddu S. Sacchi A. Blandino G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)). Differently from p53, p73 has been shown to be regulated along the cell cycle. p73 is a transcriptional target of transcription factor E2F1 during the S phase of the cell cycle, and TAp73 proteins accumulate in S phase cells (18.Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). These results suggest that as yet unknown S phase-specific target genes may be regulated by TAp73. In vitro p73 has also been shown to interact physically with and to be regulated negatively by various CDK2- and CDK1-containing complexes, although the physiological role of these interactions in the cell cycle has not yet been clearly established (32.Gaiddon C. Lokshin M. Gross I. Levasseur D. Taya Y. Loeffler J.P. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27421-27431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we show that cyclinB-p34cdc2-dependent phosphorylation of both p73α and p73β isoforms is physiologically relevant in G2/M and governs its subcellular localization and DNA binding features. Most importantly, p34cdc2-cyclinB-mediated phosphorylation of p73 on threonine 86 inhibits its transcriptional activity. At nuclear envelope breakdown, the endogenous phosphorylated p73 is excluded from condensed chromosomes and, unlike p53, disperses throughout the mitotic cytoplasm with no specific association with centrosomes. Taken together our results suggest that p73 phosphorylation by cdc2-cyclin B, and the ensuing dispersal from mitotic chromatin contributes to the down-regulation of its transcriptional potential. Instead, transcriptional inactivity of p53 in a normal mitosis is most likely ensured by its transient association with centrosomes. When p53-centrosome association is disrupted by nocodazole, p53 again becomes transcriptionally active, despite the persistence of chromatin condensation. p73 localization and transcriptional activity is not unaffected by nocodazole, suggesting that p73-dependent transcription has to be abrogated during physiological, as well as drug-induced, mitosis. We have also observed that after nocodazole removal, p73 can activate p21 in p53-null cells 3M. Fulco and P. Merlo, unpublished observations. and that up-regulation of p21 peaks several hours after release from arrest, i.e. at a time when most cells have achieved mitotic exit and have reached the following G1 phase. These results suggest that p73 can contribute to sustaining the postmitotic checkpoint activated by transient spindle damage, as already established for p53. Besides this shared function common to both p53 and p73 during G1 re-entry, several features reported here, i.e. p73 inhibitory phosphorylation at the G2-to-M transition by the p34cdc2-cyclin B complex, its lack of association with mitotic microtubules and centrosomes, and the differential behavior in response to nocodazole treatment, strongly suggest that p53 and p73 undergo specific and distinct cellular fates during mitotic division.

https://openalex.org/W2019175967,"The primary cultures of canine lens epithelial cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs for dog ferritin H- or L-chains in order to study differential expression of these chains. By using chain-specific antibodies, we determined that at 48 h after transfection overexpression of L-chain was much higher (9-fold over control) than that of H-chain (1.7-fold). We discovered that differentially transfected cells secrete overexpressed chains as homopolymeric ferritin into the media. Forty-eight hours after transfection accumulation of H-ferritin in the media was much higher (3-fold) than that of L-ferritin. This resulted in lowering of the concentration of H-chain in the cytosol. Co-transfection of cells with both H- and L-chain cDNAs increased the intracellular levels of H-chain and eliminated secretion of H-ferritin to the media. We concluded that lens epithelial cells differentially regulate concentration of both ferritin chains in the cytosol.

This is in contrast to H-chain, which is removed to the media unless there is an L-chain available to form heteropolymeric ferritin.

Ferritins are the highly conserved iron storage proteins found in species from bacteria to mammals. Mammalian ferritins, located predominantly in cytoplasm, are heteropolymers of 24 subunits of two types, heavy (H 1The abbreviations used are: H, heavy; L, light; ANOVA, analysis of variance; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; IRE, iron-response element; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MEL, mouse erythroleukemic; LEC, lens epithelial cell(s).; 21 kDa) and light (L; 19 kDa). Despite high (∼50%) sequence identity and similar three-dimensional structures, the subunits are genetically different and each has a distinct and complementary role in storing iron. The H subunit has a ferroxidase center responsible for uptake and oxidation of Fe2+ into ferric ions. Translocation of these ions into the core of the ferritin shell and their mineralization for long term storage is facilitated by the L subunit. The intracellular level of ferritin correlates with the size of the pool of intracellular iron, which plays the main role in the regulation of ferritin expression. The iron-controlled expression of both chains is primarily translational and involves binding of iron-regulatory proteins IRP1 and IRP2 (iron sensors) to iron-response element (IRE), a stem-loop structure present in the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA (1Hentze M.W.

The expression of H-chain gene is also regulated transcriptionally by cytokines (2Kwak E.L. Larochelle D.A. Beaumont C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol.

The H and L subunit ratio of mammalian ferritins varies and is highly tissue-specific; however, mechanisms by which cells maintain the chain-specific ratio are not fully understood. Although both chains complement each other in the process of sequestering and storing iron, H-chain has a broader range of functions. The overexpression of H-chain reduces cell proliferation rate (5Fan H. Villegas C. Wright J.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and apoptosis (6Cozzi A. Levi S. Corsi B. Santambrogio P. Campanella A. Gerardi G. Arosio P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 537: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and decreases heme and hemoglobin synthesis (7Picard V. Renaudie F. Porcher C. Hentze M.W. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H-chain efficiently chelates intracellular iron, and if its concentration is increased the free iron pool of the cells can be depleted causing an iron-deficient phenotype (8Cozzi A. Corsi B. Levi S. Santambrogio P. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25122-25129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, depletion of the iron pool protects cells from iron-catalyzed oxidative damage caused by free iron (9Epsztejn S. Glickstein H. Picard V. Slotki I.N. Breuer W. Beaumont C. Cabantchik Z.I. Blood. 1999; 94: 3593-3603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the H-chain for normal cell function was underscored by finding that inactivation of H-chain in knockout mice is lethal during embryogenesis (10Ferreira C. Bucchini D. Martin M.E. Levi S. Arosio P. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Contrary to what is known about H-chain, there is little information about the biological role of L-chain other than facilitating deposition of iron. It can be concluded that H-chain and not L-chain is mainly responsible for a wide range of ferritin functions. The physiological roles of ferritins with different H/L-chain ratios were extensively studied in vitro by using recombinant proteins purified from Escherichia coli and transiently or stably transfected cell lines such as primate fibroblastoid (COS) (11Corsi B. Perrone F. Bourgeois M. Beaumont C. Panzeri M.C. Cozzi A. Sangregorio R. Santambrogio P. Albertini A. Arosio P. Levi S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), mouse erythroleukemic (MEL) (7Picard V. Renaudie F. Porcher C. Hentze M.W. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or HeLa cell lines (8Cozzi A. Corsi B. Levi S. Santambrogio P. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25122-25129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The results of studies on cells, which originated from malignant tissues, generated valuable information about the structure and functions of ferritin chains. However, there is concern that physiology and genetics of the cells from the cell lines do not always closely mimic that of the normal cells in vivo. In addition, the regulation of ferritin chain expression is tissue-specific (12Beaumont C. Dugast I. Renaudie F. Souroujon M. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7498-7504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation are not yet fully understood. In our previous studies on iron metabolism and resistance to UV irradiation of dog lens epithelial cells, we used a species- and tissue-specific model to change ferritin chain ratio by transiently transfecting primary cell culture with canine H- or L-chain ferritin cDNA (13Goralska M. Holley B. McGahan M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1721-1727PubMed Google Scholar). These studies revealed a discrepancy between expression of H- and L-ferritin chains under the same conditions. The lens epithelial cells overexpressed L-chain to a much higher degree (7-fold over control) than H-chain (20% over control). However, overexpression of H-chain but not L-chain increased iron incorporation into ferritin and the ability of cells to survive UV irradiation. The large accumulation (10–20-fold) of intracellular L-chain has been also detected in vivo in humans with hereditary hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome. The accumulation of L-chain in this disease is caused by point mutations in the IRE sequence of L-chain, which results in uncontrollable synthesis of L-chain. There are several known mutations of IRE sequence of L-chain leading to significant overexpression of L-chain (14Cicilano M. Zecchina G. Roetto A. Bosio S. Infelise V. Stefani S. Mazza U. Camaschella C. Haematologica. 1999; 84: 489-492PubMed Google Scholar, 15Girelli D. Corrocher R. Bisceglia L. Olivieri O. De Franceschi L. Zelante L. Gasparini P. Blood. 1995; 86: 4050-4053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there are no known cases of significant overexpression of H-chain in vivo, despite the fact that IRE sequences of both chains are almost identical. These findings lead us to the conclusion that the detected discrepancy in expression of H- and L-chains by transfected lens epithelial cells may result from a difference in how the concentration of each ferritin chain type is controlled in order to secure the tissue-specific H/L ratio. The strict control of accumulation of H-chain could be necessary to protect cells from potentially damaging effects of this biologically active protein such as growth impairment or hypoferritinemia. The overexpression of L-chain, on the other hand, does not cause any apparent abnormalities in mammalian cells except for lenticular tissue, where formation of light-diffracting L-rich ferritin crystals creates opacities and as a result formation of premature cataracts in humans (16Brooks D.G. Manova-Todorova K. Farmer J. Lobmayr L. Wilson R.B. Eagle Jr., R.C. St. Pierre T.G. Stambolian D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1121-1126PubMed Google Scholar). The results reported here demonstrate for the first time that transfected lens epithelial cells limit accumulation of overexpressed H-chain but not L-chain, which freely accumulates in the cytosol. We also provide information about the physiological mechanism by which cells prevent the H-chain overaccumulation. Cell Culture—Lenses were obtained from mixed breed dogs euthanized at the North Carolina Animal Shelter. The anterior capsules of the lenses, which contain epithelial cells, were removed and placed in a tissue culture dish containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen). The cells, which grew out from the capsule, were dispersed by trypsinization and after reaching confluence were plated in 6-well plates at 120,000 cells/well. Plasmid Construction and Transient Transfection of LEC with Recombinant Plasmid—The coding sequences of dog H- and L-chain ferritin cDNAs were generated from dog lens epithelial cell mRNA by PCR and cloned into pTargeT mammalian expression vector (Promega) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The expression of clones of H- and L-chain was tested using TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega), and dideoxy sequencing was used to determine the cDNA sequence. Selected clones of the correct sequence, which expressed in vitro, were used for transfection (13Goralska M. Holley B. McGahan M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1721-1727PubMed Google Scholar). The plated cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA in 750 μl of DMEM containing 10% serum and 4 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) for 10–24 h. Transfection was terminated by changing media to serum-free DMEM. Cell lysates and media from transfected cells were collected after an additional 6–40 h of treatment and labeling. The degree of cell lysis after differential transfection was determined based on measurements of lactate dehydrogenase activity in the media and cell lysates with the CytoTox 96 (Promega). Treatment conditions are described in detail under “Results” and in the figure legends. Designing the Ferritin Chain-specific Antibodies—We designed two peptides corresponding to chain-specific sequences of 21 (78–99) amino acids of canine lens H-chain and to 24 (148–172) amino acids of canine lens L-chain for immunization purposes. Amino acid sequences of dog ferritin chains were obtained by translation from the cloned canine lens ferritin chain cDNA sequences by using Swiss Protein Database (13Goralska M. Holley B. McGahan M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1721-1727PubMed Google Scholar). We selected the sequences located on the outside of the ferritin molecule based on known immunological properties of human H- and L-ferritin chains (17Addison J.M. Treffry A. Harrison P.M. FEBS Lett. 1984; 175: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 18Luzzago A. Felici F. Tramontano A. Pessi A. Cortese R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 128: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The designed peptides were chemically synthesized, conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used to produce the chain-specific antiserum in immunized rabbits by Research Genetics, Inc. The anti-peptide titer determined for ELISA was 1:7,000 for anti-L antibodies and >1:200,000 for anti-H. Electrophoresis and Immunodetection of Ferritin—Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cell lysates and media from differentially transfected cells were concentrated by filtering through Centricon 10 or 100 (Millipore Corp.). The concentration of proteins in cell lysates was determined by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). The cell lysate samples containing 70–130 μg of protein and concentrated media samples collected from two wells of transfected cells were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE using Tris/Tricine buffer system or on 7% PAGE. The gel-separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hydrobond ECL, Amersham Biosciences) by semi-dry blotting at 20 V for 20 or 80 min (for PAGE separated proteins) in Bjerrum and Shafer-Nielsen transfer buffer. Ferritin bound to nitrocellulose was incubated for 2 h with one of the 1:1500 diluted chain-specific antibodies followed by a 1-h incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:1000 dilution. The immunoreactivity was detected by the ECL Western blotting Analysis System (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation of de Novo Synthesized Ferritin—Differentially transfected cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (50 μCi/750 μl DMEM methionine-free media) for 6–28 h. The total [35S]methionine uptake into control and transfected cells was measured in order to standardize the assay by eliminating variability. The cells were lysed with 0.05 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, that contained 0.15 m NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 0.02% sodium azide, and 1% Triton X-100 and immunoprecipitated with ferritin chain-specific or goat anti-horse ferritin antibodies (ICN Biochemicals). A sample of each cell lysate was precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid to quantitate [35S]methionine incorporation into total, newly synthesized protein. Ferritin was immunoprecipitated with chain-specific antibodies (10–20 μl) from 500 μl of cell lysates at 4 °C for 1 h and subsequently treated overnight with 20 μl of Protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Ferritin immunoprecipitation with goat anti-horse ferritin antibodies was performed for 1 h at 37 °C followed by treatment with 10% Pansorbin (Calbiochem) for an additional 30 min. Ferritin was released from the antibody complex by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE in Tris/Tricine buffer system. Media from over transfected, [35S]methionine-labeled cells were concentrated using Centricon (Millipore Corp.) and analyzed on 7% PAGE or 10% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. The gels were autoradiographed, and radioactivity in the bands was quantified by an Instant Imager (Packard-Canberra). In the present study, we used chain-specific antibodies to determine whether the discrepancy in overexpression of both chains by transfected LEC resulted from a difference in the ability to detect each ferritin chain. We also examined expression of each chain at different times after transfection to find if the distinct pattern of expression was responsible for the observed discrepancy. Characteristics of Ferritin Chain-specific Antibodies—Results of Western blot analysis of cell lysates of differentially transfected cells are shown on Fig. 1A. The blot developed with anti-L-chain antibodies showed the single L-chain protein band only in cell lysates of L-transfected cells. Anti-L antibodies did not react with overexpressed H-chain protein in H-transfected cells. Anti-H antibodies bound to overexpressed H-chain protein in H-transfected cells and did not detect L-chain overexpressed in L-transfectants. The concentration of L-chain in H-transfectants or H-chain in L transfectants was below the level of detection for both types of antibodies. The chain-specific antibodies were also used for Western analysis of assembled ferritin in cell lysates from differentially transfected cells separated by PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1B). Cell lysates of LEC grown to high confluency were used as a control because the ferritin concentration in subconfluent, plasmid-transfected LEC, was below the level of detection. When tested with anti-L antibodies a single band was detected in control and L-transfected cells; however, only the band detected in the control lysates migrated with horse spleen ferritin standard. The band in L-transfected cells had lower mobility than that of the control. This concurs with what has been known about the migration pattern of L-rich ferritin, which is slower than that of H-rich ferritin due to difference in the charge of the chains (19Grace Jr., J.E. Van Eden M.E. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The difference in the ferritin mobility between control and L-transfected cells indicates that subunit composition of newly synthesized ferritin from L-transfectants differs from that of LEC-specific ferritin. The overexpressed L-chain could assemble and create a separate pool of L-rich ferritin, much larger than that of tissue-specific heteropolymeric ferritin, which was undetected by Western analysis of the cytosol of transfected cells. Anti-H antibodies used for immunodetection did not react with assembled ferritin separated on nonreducing PAGE. It is possible that due to both, lower expression of H- rather than L-chain and low efficiency of semi-dry blotting transfer of large multimeric proteins, the content of H-ferritin was below the detection level. Subunit Makeup of Ferritin from Differentially Transfected LEC Determined with Chain-specific Antibodies—Both anti-H and anti-L antibodies immunoprecipitated the newly synthesized, assembled ferritin present in cell lysates of differentially transfected cells 48 h after transfection (Fig. 2). When precipitated with anti-H-chain antibodies, H-transfectants showed a significantly increased level of H-chain, 70% over H-chain content of control, plasmid-transfected cells. There was also an increased level of L-chain, about 40% over L-chain of the control. As a result of increased levels of both chains in H-transfectants, the ratio of H/L-ferritin chains in H-transfectants remained similar to that of control. L-transfected cells revealed significant increase in L-chain content (2.3-fold) when compared with the corresponding chain of plasmid transfectants, but this increase was not associated with an increase in the level of H-chain, which remained the same as in control, plasmid-transfected cells. Based on these results, we can conclude that the ferritin of L-transfectants, detected with anti-H antibodies, must be a heteropolymeric protein of lower H/L ratio than that of endogenous LEC ferritin because anti-H antibodies would not react with free L-chain or L-homopolymeric ferritin but only with heteropolymers containing H-chain. Results of ferritin immunoprecipitation with anti-L antibodies in the most part concurred with data obtained with anti-H antibodies. The overexpression of H-chain in H-transfectants was associated with an increase of L-chain content. The L-transfected cells demonstrated much higher levels of L-chain in L-transfectants, 9-fold over L-chain in control cells, when anti-L antibodies were used, in comparison to that detected with anti-H antibodies (2.3-fold). These results indicated that the majority of overexpressed L-chain remains either as a free chain or is assembled into L-rich or L-homopolymeric ferritin, which would not react with anti-H antibodies. Distinct Changes in Levels of Overexpressed Ferritin Chains in LEC Over Time—In our previous study we examined ferritin chain overexpression 48 h after a 20-h transfection. The time was selected based on the transfection efficiency determined with pEGFP vector containing green fluorescent protein cDNA and confirmed by dramatic overexpression of L-chain in L-transfectants detected at that time. In the present study we hypothesized that lower expression of H-chain could result from different time courses of L-chain and H-chain expression. To test this possibility, we reduced the time of transfection from 20 to 10 h, and the time at which H- and L-chain overexpression was examined to 10 h post-transfection. The results of ferritin immunoprecipitation with polyclonal, goat anti-horse ferritin antibodies are presented in Fig. 3. Overexpression of H-chain in H-transfected LEC, 20 h after transfection, was 2.4-fold over that expressed in control plasmid-transfected cells. It was significantly more than that detected in both our earlier study at the 68-h time point (20% over control) and at 48 h in our present study with chain-specific antibodies (70% over control). In contrast, overexpression of L-chain, 7-fold over control, plasmid-transfected cells, was comparable with that detected at 68 h (7-fold) (13Goralska M. Holley B. McGahan M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1721-1727PubMed Google Scholar) and similar to that detected with chain-specific antibodies (9-fold over control). The lower concentration of H-chain in H-transfectants, 68 h after transfection, could result not only from lower expression but also from lower accumulation of newly synthesized H-chain when compared with that of L-chain. This would explain the decrease in content of de novo synthesized H-chain as detected between 20 and 68 h after transfection (2.4- to 1.7-fold of control) and steady level of L-chain during the same time. Ferritin Chains Overexpressed in Transfected LEC Are Released to the Media—The media from LEC transfected for 20 h and labeled with [35S]methionine for an additional 48 h were concentrated by filtration through Centricon 10 filters and analyzed by Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The results are shown in Fig. 4A. The ferritin chains were detected in the media of both H- and L-transfectants. The media from H-transfectants, 68 h after transfection (labeled for 48 h Fig. 4A), contained significantly more H-chain (3.4-fold) when compared with L-chain found in the media of L-transfectants. This is despite the fact that the L-chain content of the cytosol of L-transfectants at that time was 7–9-fold higher than that of H-chain in H-chain transfectants. The presence of H-chain in the media from H-transfected cells and L-chain in media from L-transfectants was confirmed by Western blot developed with chain-specific antibodies (Fig. 4B). Ferritin subunits were not detected in media from control, plasmid-transfected cells, and media from H- and L-chain- transfected cells did not contain detectable amounts of the opposite subunit. The media from LEC labeled with [35S]methionine for 20 or 48 h, concentrated on Centricon-100 filters, were also analyzed by nonreducing 7% PAGE (Fig. 5A). The electropherograms show the presence of a single band in media from H- and L-transfectants. The band present in L-transfectant media had much lower mobility (Fig. 5A) than that of H-transfectant media. This documents the similarity in electrophoretic mobility between ferritin found in the media and present in the cytosol of L-chain transfected cells (Fig. 1B). The separation of media ferritin on SDS-PAGE eliminated the difference in media ferritin mobility (Fig. 5B). The above results indicate that the overexpressed ferritin chains are present in the media as an assembled ferritin, predominantly or exclusively homopolymeric. During 20 h of labeling H- and L-transfectants accumulated a similar amount of ferritin. However, after an additional 28 h (68 h after transfection) concentration of ferritin in the media of H-transfectants was 3-fold over that found in media of L-transfectants. This indicates a negative correlation between cytosolic level of H-chain, which peaked at 20 h and declined between 20 and 68 h and the accumulation of H-ferritin in the media, which increased significantly during 20–48 h after transfection. Because there were no differences in the activity of lactate dehydrogenase in the media and cell lysates of differentially transfected cells (data not shown), we concluded that the presence of ferritin in the media resulted from active secretion rather than from leakage. Co-transfection of LEC with Both H-chain and L-chain Ferritin Clones—Results of immunoprecipitation of newly synthesized ferritin from cell lysates of co-transfected and singly transfected LEC, 20 and 48 h after transfection, are presented in Fig. 6. At 20 h co-transfected cell lysates contained the same level of H-chain as H-transfectants. After an additional 28 h, the H-chain level in H-transfected cells was half that found in co-transfected cells. In contrast, the lower level (50%) of L-chain found at the 20-h time point in co-transfected cells increased after an additional 28 h and reached a concentration not significantly different from that of singly L-transfected cells. The cytosolic H/L-chain ratios calculated for each experimental group showed a 40% decrease (4.50 to 2.75) in singly H-transfected cells between 20 and 48 h. The H/L ratio in L-transfected cells stays the same at both time points indicating that content of L-chain does not change with time. At the 20-h time point in cells co-transfected with both L and H expression vectors, the overexpression of H-chain was associated with lower concentration of L-chain when compared with singly L-transfected cells. However, after an additional 28 h the concentration of newly synthesized L-chain in co-transfectants reached a level not significantly different from that observed for L-transfectants. The increase in L-chain level at 48 h lowers the H/L ratio in co-transfectants from 1.22 to 0.53 despite the fact that the level of H-chain in these cells was also elevated compared with singly H-chain transfected cells. Electrophoretic analysis of the ferritin content of the media from co-transfected cells in comparison to single-transfected cells 48 h after transfection is presented in Fig. 7, A and B. The co-transfection with vectors carrying both ferritin genes almost completely abrogates secretion of assembled ferritin into the media (Fig. 7A). When analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, the media from all experimental groups showed the presence of ferritin chains (Fig. 7B). The media from co-transfected cells had only small amounts of L-chain and even less H-chain when compared with single L- and H-transfected cells. These results clearly indicate that there is no accumulation of assembled ferritin and very little accumulation of free chains in the media of LEC if cells are overexpressing both H- and L-ferritin chains simultaneously. Given that media of both H- and L-transfectants separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions did not contain a significant amount of the opposite subunit (Figs. 4A and 7B), it can be concluded that ferritin secreted by transfected LEC is exclusively or predominantly homopolymeric. The findings that media from non-transfected LEC do not contain ferritin or free ferritin chains (data not shown) corroborates our theory that ferritin secretion is a way of removing overproduced chains that are not assembled into heteropolymeric ferritin of a tissue-specific H/L ratio. The high similarity of protein structure between H- and L-ferritin chains creates difficulties in their distinction and quantitation. The antibodies developed against synthetic peptides whose sequences were designed based on determined amino acid sequences of canine ferritin chains (13Goralska M. Holley B. McGahan M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1721-1727PubMed Google Scholar) proved to be helpful in overcoming these difficulties. The chain-specific antibodies reacted specifically with ferritin chains in free as well as in assembled form. With these antibodies we improved detection of both overexpressed chains by 30–40% in comparison to that detected with polyclonal antibodies, and we confirmed our earlier findings that 48 h after transfection differentially transfected LEC contain 5 times more newly synthesized, overexpressed L-chain than H-chain (13Goralska M. Holley B. McGahan M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1721-1727PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that the overexpression of H-chain increases the levels of the endogenous L-chain as it has been detected with both anti-H and anti-L antibodies. This differs from what has been reported in studies on ferritin chain expression in transiently transfected COS (11Corsi B. Perrone F. Bourgeois M. Beaumont C. Panzeri M.C. Cozzi A. Sangregorio R. Santambrogio P. Albertini A. Arosio P. Levi S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and stably transfected MEL (7Picard V. Renaudie F. Porcher C. Hentze M.W. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cell lines overexpression of H-chain caused a decrease in biosynthesis and an accumulation of endogenous L-chain. The discrepancy between these findings may result from lower accumulation of H-chain found in our system but can also indicate that mechanisms by which cells maintain tissue-specific chain ratio may be distinctively different in cells originating from primary culture than those of this particular cell line. We could not determine conclusively whether increased concentration of L-chain affects the H-chain biosynthesis. The association of overexpression of L-chain with the increase of endogenous H-chain was detected only with anti-L but not with anti-H antibodies. It is possible that anti-H antibodies do not recognize ferritin of high content of L-chain as efficiently as anti-L antibodies. The analysis of the chain ratio of newly synthesized ferritin immunoprecipitated with chain-specific antibodies provides indirect evidence that overexpressed L-chains assemble with newly synthesized endogenous H-chains into heteropolymeric ferritin. The H/L-chain ratio of ferritin from L-transfected LEC was lower than that of endogenous plasmid-transfected cells, even if detected with anti-H antibodies (2.10 versus 0.95). The discrepancy in overexpression of L-chain detected with anti-L-(9-fold over control) and with anti-H antibodies (2.3-fold over control) indicated, however, that the majority of newly synthesized L-chains is assembled into L-homopolymeric ferritin. This was confirmed by Western blot analysis of ferritin present in cell lysates of L-transfectants (Fig. 1B). Based on the above findings we concluded that some of the overexpressed L-chains assemble in the cytosol into heteropolymeric ferritin of lower than the endogenous LEC H/L-chain ratio, but the majority of newly synthesized L-chains create a separate pool of either exclusively L- or L-rich ferritin. In contrast to L-chain overexpression, the H/L-ferritin chain ratio in H-chain overexpressing LEC was not different from that of control cells. Knowing that the overexpression of H-chain was associated with an increased biosynthesis of endogenous L-chain, we speculated that most of the overexpressed H-chains assembled into ferritin of the chain ratio characteristic for lenticular tissue. Because we could not detect the assembled ferritin on Western blot developed with anti-H antibodies we were not able to confirm this hypothesis. By having established that the discrepancy in expression of ferritin chains did not result from differences in our ability to detect each chain, we examined the expression of both chains at shorter time, 20 h after transfection, and compared the results with that detected previously, 68 h after transfection (13Goralska M. Holley B. McGahan M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1721-1727PubMed Google Scholar). The comparison revealed that during the time 20–68 h the ratio of L-chain biosynthesis remained the same, 7-fold over control plasmid-transfected cells. In contrast, the overexpression of H-chains decreased by half during the same time from 2.4-fold over control at 20 h to 1.2-fold at 68 h. In our previous study we determined that over the same time period L-transfected cells accumulate 10 times more ferritin than H-transfected cells when measured by ELISA (13Goralska M. Holley B. McGahan M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1721-1727PubMed Google Scholar). Such a large discrepancy in accumulation of ferritin could not be explained exclusively by the discovered difference in ratio of biosynthesis of the chain. The lower concentration in cytosol of newly synthesized ferritin in H-transfected in comparison to L-transfected cells could result from combination of both reduced biosynthesis during 20–68 h after transfection and post-translational modifications of newly synthesized H-chain. The recent findings (20Watanabe K. Muranishi N. Murata Y. Orino K. Okano S. Yamamoto S. Biometals. 2000; 13: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Orino K. Terada A. Yoshida A. Okano S. Higuchi S. Natsuhori M. Watanabe K. Biometals. 2003; 16: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) of H-rich ferritin in canine serum (H/L ratio 3.5) led us to the discovery that overexpressed ferritin chains are secreted into the media, predominantly as assembled homopolymeric ferritin. The secretion of H-ferritin by H-transfectants was much higher (3-fold) than release of L-ferritin to the media by L-transfectants. Because the increase of H-ferritin content in the media correlated with a decreased level of this chain in cytosol, we concluded that the secretion of H-chain to the media intensifies as a result of its higher concentration in cytosol. The increased secretion limits H-chain accumulation in cytosol and may appear as a lower expression of H-chain. The long time (20–48 h) of metabolic labeling used in our study, necessary due to low density of cells used for transient transfection, provided the time frame for newly synthesized chains to be released into the media. The L-transfected cells released less ferritin to the media when compared with secretion of H-chain by H-transfected LEC. The lower electrophoretic mobility of media ferritin of L-transfectants was similar to mobility of the main fraction of cytosolic ferritin of these cells and differed significantly from that of endogenous LEC ferritin. This indicates that overexpressed ferritin assembled in cytosol and released to the media by L-transfectants has a high content of less acidic L-chain. The Western analysis of subunit makeup of ferritin secreted into the media by H- and L-transfected cells did not show the presence of the matching ferritin chain. We also were not able to detect newly synthesized ferritin in the media of plasmid-transfected cells and in the media from confluent non-transfected LEC. These findings combined with the discovery that ferritin present in the media of transfected cells predominantly if not exclusively consists of the chain overexpressed in the cytosol implied that differential secretion could be a part of physiological mechanisms by which cells maintain the ferritin chain levels in order to secure tissue-specific ferritin H/L-chain ratio. To test this hypothesis we co-transfected LEC with both cDNA coding H- and L-chain and discovered that LEC overexpressing both ferritin chains did not secrete assembled ferritin to the media. These results document for the first time that differential secretion of newly synthesized ferritin chains could play a significant role in regulating the chain makeup of cytosolic ferritin. When enough of both H- and L-chains is made, they can assemble into heteropolymeric ferritin with the correct tissue-specific ratio. However, when either H- or L-chains are overexpressed and there is not enough of the other chain produced endogenously, the excess is assembled into homopolymeric ferritin and secreted to the media. These findings also indicate more strict control of H-chain cytosolic level than that of L-chain in order possibly to prevent H-chain overaccumulation. It is understandable considering that an excess of H-rich ferritin in cytosol could deregulate highly controlled iron homeostasis and affect cell proliferation. The L-transfected LEC accumulate a significant amount of L-ferritin in the cytosol and secrete less L-chain into the media. It has been known that the accumulation of L-homopolymeric ferritin seems not to have a negative effect on any tissue other than lenticular in which the formation of L-rich ferritin crystals causes opacities and premature cataracts in humans (16Brooks D.G. Manova-Todorova K. Farmer J. Lobmayr L. Wilson R.B. Eagle Jr., R.C. St. Pierre T.G. Stambolian D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1121-1126PubMed Google Scholar). The simultaneous overexpression of both ferritin chains affects their levels. The overexpression of H-chain was associated with lower expression of exogenous L-chain by co-transfected cells particularly at 20 h after transfection. This could not be explained by a decreased cytosolic iron content caused by an increase in H-chain concentration as shown by Picard et al. (22Picard V. Epsztejn S. Santambrogio P. Cabantchik Z.I. Beaumont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15382-15386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), because L-chain mRNA transcribed from the cDNA cloned into expression vector used in this study did not contain an IRE. The co-transfected LEC maintained the higher level of H-chain expression, in comparison to singly H-transfected cells, during the entire 20–48-h time after transfection. This combined with the finding that media of co-transfected cells do not contain the H-chain strongly indicates that cells retain the overexpressed H-chain in cytosol only if there is enough L-chain to form heteropolymeric ferritin. The observed differences in chain biosynthesis between singly and co-transfected LEC suggest the possibility of post-transcriptional regulation of the expression of one chain by the other. There are no other studies on overexpression of ferritin chains by transiently transfected cells from primary cell cultures. Transient transfection of primate fibroblastoid COS-7, with cDNA for H- and L-human ferritin chains, resulted in large accumulation of both ferritin chains (200–500-fold when measured by ELISA), which did not cross-hybridize with endogenous chains and did not incorporate iron (11Corsi B. Perrone F. Bourgeois M. Beaumont C. Panzeri M.C. Cozzi A. Sangregorio R. Santambrogio P. Albertini A. Arosio P. Levi S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The stable transfections of both the human (HeLa) (8Cozzi A. Corsi B. Levi S. Santambrogio P. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25122-25129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and murine (MEL) (7Picard V. Renaudie F. Porcher C. Hentze M.W. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cell lines with species-specific H-ferritin chain cDNA proved to be more successful. The stably transfected HeLa cells accumulated 14–16-fold more exogenous H-ferritin over the background for 7 days after transfection. The accumulation of H-ferritin in HeLa cells resulted in significantly reduced cell growth, but cells did not show signs of toxicity up to 6 weeks in culture. The very high 10:1 H/L-chain ratio of HeLa ferritin, not found in ferritins of any other normal mammalian cell type, could condition these cells to withstand such a significant concentration of H-chain. The overexpression of H-chain in stably transfected MEL cells was much lower than that in HeLa cells (3–4-fold over control) and therefore is comparable with what we found for transiently transfected LEC (2.4-fold over control) with 30–40% transfection rate. In conclusion, the data clearly demonstrated that LEC differentially regulate the concentration of both ferritin chains in the cytosol. The overexpression of L-chain results in significant accumulation of L-homopolymeric ferritin in the cytosol and lower secretion of this homopolymer into the media. Contrary to L-chain, regulation of cytosolic concentration of H-chain is very strict. The overexpressed ferritin H-chain does not accumulate in the cytosol to the same extent as the L-chain but is removed into the media unless there is enough L-chain in cytosol to form heteropolymeric ferritin. Lack of such a strong control over L-chain levels could explain why unregulated (due to mutation in IRE) biosynthesis of L-chain leads to its accumulation. This accumulation may result in opacification of lenses in humans with hereditary hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome. The differential secretion may not be the only way the cells control levels of ferritin chains. The selective degradation or deposition of overproduced ferritin chain into insoluble hemosiderin (23Miyazaki E. Kato J. Kobune M. Okumura K. Sasaki K. Shintani N. Arosio P. Niitsu Y. Gut. 2002; 50: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) could also contribute significantly to the maintenance of the tissue-specific H/L ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2002125711,"To identify genes that are frequently downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a panel of putative underexpressed genes was first established by an in-house cDNA macroarray method. Two different assays, semiquantitative RT-PCR combined with Northern analysis and customized cDNA microarray analysis, were used to screen through these genes and the results were compared. Several genes, some with unknown function, were confirmed to be downregulated by both the methods. The effect of a downregulated gene, BMAL2, on cell proliferation was examined. Overexpression of antisense BMAL2 RNA in 293EBNA cells resulted in reduced cell cycle time, increased plating efficiency in soft agar, diminished TNF-alpha-induced increment of CPP32/caspase-3 activity, and a reduced proportion of cells in the G2 phase with a concomitantly increased proportion of cells in the S phase. In conclusion, by combining three different methods, we have obtained a panel of frequently down regulated genes in HCC, including BMAL2. Antisense overexpression of BMAL2 enhances cell proliferation."

The biochemistry of nitroxyl (HNO) has attracted considerable interest in recent years. In cells, the biosynthesis of HNO is believed to proceed via reduction of NO· by superoxide dismutase (1Murphy M.E. Sies H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1616-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This cytotoxicity was associated with activation of the nuclear nick sensor enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, perturbation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and an increased production of superoxide (16Bai P.

Recently, we have reported that HNO can generate ·OH in a pH-dependent manner (20Stoyanovsky D.A. Clancy R.M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5093-5094Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because of its high reactivity, ·OH is one of the most toxic species that can be formed in biological systems. This free radical reacts with most cellular molecules at diffusion-controlled rates; thus it cannot diffuse from its site of generation further than the nearest molecules (22Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4411) Google Scholar). Hence, we hypothesized that the pH-dependent generation of ·OH from HNO can have toxicological significance, particularly because tissue acidification occurs under various pathological conditions, such as hypoxia, inflammation, and cancer (23Gasbarrini A. Borle A.B. Farghali H. Francavilla A. Van Thiel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7545-7552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Stubbs M. McSheehy P.M. Griffiths J.R. Bashford C.L. Mol. Med.

In the present work, we provide further experimental evidence that HNO generates ·OH in an oxygen-independent manner. We also report that HNO exhibits a pH-dependent toxicity to normal human fibroblasts and SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells that could be impeded by scavengers of radical species.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—All reagents used were purchased from Sigma. The solutions used in the experiments were prepared in deionized and Chelex 100-treated water or potassium phosphate buffer. Sodium trioxodinitrate was either purchased from Calbiochem, Inc.

Analysis—HPLC was performed with a Waters liquid chromatograph (Milford, MA). Separation was achieved with a C-18 reverse phase column (Microsorb, 4.6 mm × 25 cm, 5 μm, 100 A Rainin Instrument Co., Inc., Emeryville, CA). The mobile phase was saturated with helium and contained 10 mm lithium perchlorate and either water with 30% (v/v) methanol for analysis of phenol and benzene diols, or 70% methanol for analysis of N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN) derivatives. All HPLC analyses were conducted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Electrochemical detection of PBN-derived adducts was carried out at +0.8 V with a LC-4C/CC5 amperometric system (Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN) equipped with glassy carbon electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode (27Stoyanovsky D.A. Cederbaum A.I. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Phenol and benzene diols were analyzed electrochemically at +0.95 V.ESR Measurements—ESR measurements were performed on a Bruker ECS106 spectrometer with 50 kHz magnetic field modulation at room temperature (25 °C). ESR spectrometer settings were: modulation amplitude 0.7 G, scan time 40 s, time constant 0.64 s, microwave power 20 mW, and receiver gain 1 × 103–1 × 105.Cell Experiments—Normal human fibroblasts or SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells (800–1000 cells per plate) were treated for 30 min at 37 °C with Na2N2O3 in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.2–7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.2 mm CaCl2. Thereafter, the fluid was removed, the cells were covered with minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. In selected experiments, the incubation medium containing Na2N2O3 also included ascorbic acid (5 mm) plus superoxide dismutase (300 units/ml), catalase (500 units/ml), and EDTA (0.1 mm), or α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (10 mm) or Me2SO (0.2 m). On completion of the incubations, the cell number was determined by the crystal violet method.Anaerobic Experiments—To achieve anaerobic conditions, all solutions were placed in septum-caped vials and purged for 30 min with a stream of nitrogen. Thereafter, additions to the final reaction solution were made through the septum of the corresponding vial using a 0.10-ml gas-tight syringe.RESULTSEPR Analysis of the Hydrolysis of Na2N2O3—In model studies aimed at mimicking the biochemistry of HNO, sodium trioxodinitrate (Na2N2O3; Angeli's salt) is often used as a donor of this species. Depending on the degree of protonation, the stability of this compound in aqueous solutions follows the sequence N2O32-(1c)x003E;HN2O3-(1b)x003E;H2N2O3(1a) (pK 1 = 3.0 and pK 2 = 9.35; Scheme 1) (28Hughes M.N. Wimbledon P.E. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1976; : 703-704Crossref Google Scholar). 1c is relatively stable in alkaline solutions (pH > 10). However, the rate of decomposition of 1b within the pH interval 4–8 is [H+]-independent and leads to the formation of HNO (k1b = 5.1 × 10–4m–1 s–1 (29Bonner F.T. Ravid B. J. Inorg. Chem. 1975; 14: 558-563Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar)). The latter species can dimerize to cis-hyponitrous acid (3a), which is unstable and decomposes to N2O and H2O. The decomposition of 3a is especially fast in aqueous solutions with pH 6–13 (30Loechler E.L. Schneider A.M. Schwartz D.B. Hollocher T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 3076-3087Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Anderson J.H. Analyst. 1963; 88: 494-499Crossref Google Scholar), which most likely reflects shifts in the equilibrium between 3a and 3b in favor of the latter (Scheme 1). Bonner and Ravid (29Bonner F.T. Ravid B. J. Inorg. Chem. 1975; 14: 558-563Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar) reported that the hydrolysis of Na2(O15NNO2) at either pH 3.0 or 8.5 yields exclusively 15N2O and NO2-, implying that this process follows the reaction sequence presented in Scheme 1 (29Bonner F.T. Ravid B. J. Inorg. Chem. 1975; 14: 558-563Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, these authors noted that the proportions of 15N in the reaction products were different at pH 5.0, suggesting that some modification of pathway cannot be ruled out. At pH < 4, the decomposition rate of 1a increases with increasing acidity with production of NO· (28Hughes M.N. Wimbledon P.E. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1976; : 703-704Crossref Google Scholar, 29Bonner F.T. Ravid B. J. Inorg. Chem. 1975; 14: 558-563Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar).We recently reported that 1b can convert primary alcohols to aldehydes via the intermediate formation of ·OH (20Stoyanovsky D.A. Clancy R.M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5093-5094Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the formation of ·OH was characterized by EPR spin trapping analysis. However, we could not evaluate the absolute amounts of spin-trapped ·OH as the resulting nitroxides are readily converted to EPR silent hydroxylamines under reductive conditions (32Stoyanovsky D.A. Melnikov Z. Cederbaum A.I. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Quantitative evaluation of the latter reaction is important because the production of ·OH from HNO may have toxicological implications. Hence, we have carried out EPR/HPLC-UV/EC spin trapping experiments optimized for the quantitation of ·OH under reductive conditions.In the presence of FeIII and N-methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate (MGD), the hydrolysis of 1b was paralleled by the appearance of the characteristic EPR spectrum of ·ON-FeII-MGD formed via the interaction of HNO and FeIII-MGD (Fig. 1A; Scheme 2) (18Xia Y. Cardounel A.J. Vanin A.F. Zweier J.L. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The formation of ·ON-FeII-MGD was H+-independent within the pH interval of 4.5 to 7.4 (Fig. 1A), which is in agreement with previous findings (28Hughes M.N. Wimbledon P.E. J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1976; : 703-704Crossref Google Scholar) that the rate of 1b hydrolysis at these proton concentrations is constant. The substitution of FeIII-MGD with 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyroline N-oxide (DMPO) resulted in the appearance of the typical EPR spectrum of DMPO/·OH (6; Fig. 1B) (33Buettner G.R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 259-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar), suggesting that the hydrolysis of 1b resulted in the formation of ·OH. In contrast to the formation of HNO, the generation of 6 from 1b was strongly affected by the acidity of the reaction solutions. The latter implies that ·OH was not directly derived from 1b but rather followed the release of HNO (Fig. 1, panel A compared with panel B; Fig. 4D).Fig. 1EPR spectra of ·ON-FeII-MGD and DMPO/·OH formed in solutions of Na2N2O3, FeIII-MGD, and DMPO.

To solve this experimental difficulty, we used an HPLC protocol for quantification of ·OH that is based on the oxidation of Me2SO (32Stoyanovsky D.A. Melnikov Z. Cederbaum A.I. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The latter is oxidized by ·OH to ·CH3, which forms relatively stable nitroxides (t ½ > 48 h) with PBN. The hydrolysis of 1b in the presence of Me2SO and PBN produced the typical EPR spectrum of PBN/·CH3 (4; Fig. 2 trace 2) (33Buettner G.R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 259-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). However, both 1b and HNO could act as reductants (36Al-Ajlouni A.M. Gould E.S. Inorg.

In the presence of reductants, nitroxides can be readily reduced to the corresponding EPR silent hydroxylamines (32Stoyanovsky D.A. Melnikov Z. Cederbaum A.I. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In support of the latter assumption, the addition of K3[Fe(CN)6] to an extract of a reaction solution consisting of 1b, Me2SO, and PBN resulted in a pronounced increase of the EPR signal of 4. This effect most likely reflected the oxidation of the EPR silent hydroxylamine 5 to 4 (Scheme 2). When the reaction solution was analyzed by HPLC with electrochemical detection, the predominant formation of 5 was observed (Fig. 3); an addition of K3[Fe(CN)6] to the analyzed solutions resulted in the inter-conversion of the HPLC peaks reflecting the elution of 5 and 4, respectively. The identity of compounds 4 and 5 was confirmed by coinjections of authentic HPLC standards as described previously (32Stoyanovsky D.A. Melnikov Z. Cederbaum A.I. Anal.

The actual production of ·OH in this reaction system, however, cannot be estimated as the efficiency of the ·OH-dependent oxidation of Me2SO and the subsequent spin trapping of ·CH3 are undefined. Under anaerobic conditions, the reaction profile remained unchanged (Fig. 4A , open circles), which attests that the generation of ·OH from HNO was O2-independent and reflected neither the intermediate formation of ONOO– (Scheme 4) (21Kirsch M. de Groot H.

For example, radiolytically generated ·OH reacts with phenol via either abstraction of the hydrogen atom from its -OH function (kH = 2.1 × 109m–1 s–1) or aryl addition (k Ar = 6.6 × 109m–1 s–1) to give a phenol phenoxyl (10) or dihydroxycyclohexadienyl (8) radical, respectively (40Field R.J. Raghavan N.V. Brummer J.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 86: 2443-2449Google Scholar, 41Hage J.P. Llobet A. Sawyer D.T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions, 8 interacts with O2 to form benzene diols (9) and the superoxide anion radical; benzene-1,2-diol and benzene-1,4-diol, forming at a ratio of 2:1, are the main isomers generated in this reaction (41Hage J.P. Llobet A. Sawyer D.T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, oxidation of phenol by Fenton-type reagents such as L x FeII-OOH leads to the formation of benzene-1,2-diol and benzene-1,4-diol at a ratio that depends on the ligand of the corresponding iron complex and ranges from 11 to ∞ (41Hage J.P. Llobet A. Sawyer D.T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It should be noted that 8 and 10 can follow several reaction pathways, implying that the formation of 9 can only be a qualitative marker for free ·OH. For example, the hydroxylation of phenol by ·OH in the absence of oxygen (or other electron acceptors, such as K3[Fe(CN)6] and quinones (42Raghavan N.V. Steenken S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 3495-3499Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar)) predominantly leads to the formation of biphenyl diols (11 (41Hage J.P. Llobet A. Sawyer D.T. Bioorg. Med.

Within the pH interval of 4 to 7 (ΔpH = 0.5), the ratio between benzene-1,2-diol and benzene-1,4-diol was 2.2 + 0.24 (n = 5; mean ± S.E.; Fig. 6C), which further supports the notion for the generation of free ·OH in solutions of 1b. In the absence of 1b, no formation of 9 was observed (Fig. 6A , open circles). The 1b-dependent hydroxylation of phenol proceeded with two pH optimums (Fig. 7). Because the pK of phenol is 9.98, the effects of H+ on the formation of 9 most likely reflected changes in the rates of reactions 8 → 9 and 8 → 10, respectively. Hence, pH variations in this reaction system may affect the formation of ·OH and 9 to different extents. The production of 9 increased with increasing temperatures up to 35 °C, whereas at higher temperatures a considerable autoxidation of the reaction products was observed (data not shown). The impeded formation of 9 under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 8A) was attributed to a shift in the equilibrium between 8 and 10, which ultimately resulted in a predominant formation of 11 (41Hage J.P. Llobet A. Sawyer D.T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, the formation of 9 was markedly increased when the reaction solutions were purged with a stream of air. The latter effect was most likely because of a more efficient oxidation of 8 to 9 (40Field R.J. Raghavan N.V. Brummer J.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 86: 2443-2449Google Scholar, 42Raghavan N.V.

Desferrioxamine did not affect the formation of 9 to any significant extent, indicating that metal ions did not participate in the overall reaction mechanism. However, the hydroxylation of phenol was inhibited by scavengers of ·OH such as ethanol and Me2SO (Fig. 8B) that are known to interact with this radical species at appreciable rates (k Me2SO = 7 × 109m–1 s–1 and k EtOH = 2.2 × 109m–1 s–1, respectively (45Veltwisch D.

https://openalex.org/W1484493305,"In many cancers, a high constitutive activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB has been implicated in tumor progression and apoptosis resistance, making NF-kappaB an attractive target for cancer therapy. Here, we describe the specific inhibition of NF-kappaB by the intracellular delivery of IkappaBalpha through VP22-mediated protein transduction. The Herpes virus protein VP22 has attracted great attention in gene therapy, because of its ability to migrate from an original expressing cell into surrounding recipient cells, resulting in high levels of protein transduction. To evaluate the use of VP22 as a vehicle for NF-kappaB inhibition, we expressed several versions of VP22-IkappaBalpha fusion proteins in baculovirus, bacteria, and mammalian cells. While we could not detect transcellular migration of different VP22-IkappaBalpha constructs, interestingly, baculovirally expressed VP22-IkappaBalpha was efficiently delivered into cells after exogenous administration. The purified and imported VP22-IkappaBalpha retained its function and efficiently inhibited both constitutive and inducible NF-kappaB activation. We further show that the 34 C-terminal amino acids of VP22 were sufficient for the import property, suggesting also that the ability of intercellular migration and cellular import are not linked to each other. Together, our results demonstrate that recombinant VP22 acts as an efficient vehicle for the exogenous delivery of IkappaBalpha and, moreover, might find applications to block NF-kappaB activation specifically."

This multisubunit complex consists of two functionally distinct parts. eEF1A catalyzes the GTP-dependent delivery of aminoacylated tRNAs to the acceptor site of the ribosome. The eEF1B complex acts as an exchange factor (GEF) and recycles the inactive eEF1A-GDP released from the ribosome to the active GTP-bound state by stimulating nucleotide exchange on eEF1A. In metazoans, eEF1B is composed of three subunits, namely eEF1Bα, eEF1Bβ, and eEF1Bγ. Both the eEF1Bα and eEF1Bβ subunits promote in vitro nucleotide exchange reactions through a homologous C-terminal catalytic domain (2van Damme H.T.F. Amons R. Karssies R. Timmers C.J. Janssen G.M.C.

Unlike eEF1A and eEF1Bα (and eEF1Bβ), which are functional homologues of EF-Tu and EF-Ts in bacteria, eEF1Bγ is unique to eukaryotes. In fungi, eEF1B contains only eEF1Bα and eEF1Bγ. Recent structural information has notably extended the understanding of the portion of the eukaryotic elongation cycle taking place away from the ribosome. After the initial solution structure of a catalytically active 91-residue GEF domain from human eEF1Bα (3Pérez J.M.J. Siegal G. Kriek J. Hard K. Dijk J. Canters G.W. Möller W. Struct. Fold.

However, in vivo, the situation is much more complex with eEF1 in higher eukaryotes occurring as an assembly of at least four subunits. Based on various biochemical data, several models have been proposed for the quaternary organization of the eEF1 complex (6Mansilla F. Friis I. Jadidi M. Nielsen K.M. Clark B.F.C. Knudsen C.R.

Although presenting some discrepancies, all these models agree on the tight binding of eEF1Bα (and to a lesser extent eEF1Bβ) to eEF1Bγ through their respective N-terminal regions.

Wolfson A.D. Orlovsky A.F. Gladilin K.L. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 262-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Despite this extensive biochemical analysis, many questions about the function(s) of all of the eEF1 components remain unanswered. To extend our knowledge of the eEF1 organization and mechanism and shed light on the biological function of eEF1Bγ, we have focused in the present work on a structural study of this subunit. Only scant information concerning the physiological function of eEF1Bγ is available. This subunit by itself is devoid of any exchange activity, but eEF1Bγ isolated from the brine shrimp Artemia stimulates the in vitro catalytic activity of the GEF eEF1Bα (12Janssen G.M.C. Möller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Moreover, the protein was found to be poorly soluble in aqueous buffers and to co-purify and co-immunoprecipitate with tubulin. Based on these properties, Janssen et al. (12Janssen G.M.C. Möller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) proposed that this subunit might participate in directing components of the protein synthetic apparatus toward membranes and/or the cytoskeleton of the cell. Disruption of the two eEF1Bγ coding genes tef3 and tef4 present in the yeast genome is non-lethal (13Kinzy T.G. Ripmaster T.L. Woolford J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2703-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The data currently available suggest that this subunit might be a regulatory element within eEF1B. The eEF1Bγ subunit is overexpressed in some gastric and esophageal carcinomas (14Chi K.F. Jones D.V. Frazier M.L. Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15Mimori K. Mori M. Tanaka S. Akiyoshi T. Sugimachi K.

Such phosphorylation may be part of a cell state-dependent regulation of the translation of valinerich proteins as compared with other protein types (17Monnier A. Bellé R. Morales J. Cormier P. Boulben S. Mulner-Lorillon O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1453-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, alteration of the level of eEF1Bγ encoding transcripts has been detected in mice tissues as a result of the onset of the aging process (18Lee C.K. Weindruch R. Prolla T.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 19Lee C.K. Klopp R.G. Weindruch R. Prolla T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Very recently, eEF1Bγ was identified as capable of binding a highly conserved element within the 3′-UTR of vimentin mRNA using the yeast three-hybrid method (20Al Maghrebi M. Brulé H. Padkina M. Allen C. Holmes W.M. Zehner Z.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5017-5028Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Additional complementary experiments performed on the endogenous as well as the recombinant human subunit extended this result to any type of RNA molecules tested, indicating thereby that eEF1Bγ is a nonspecific RNA-binding protein (Ref. 20Al Maghrebi M.

In order to gain further insight into the properties of this subunit, we have expressed recombinant human eEF1Bγ in Escherichia coli. In agreement with previous observations made on the Artemia eEF1Bα/eEF1Bγ complex (21van Damme H. Amons R. Janssen G. Möller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we found that the human eEF1Bγ is comprised of two trypsin-resistant, independently folding domains, namely a glutathione S-transferase-homologous N-terminal region (domain 1, ∼25 kDa) responsible for the interaction with eEF1Bα and a highly conserved, exceptionally protease-resistant 162 residue C-terminal part (domain 2, eEF1Bγ-(276–437)). The domains are connected through a lysine-rich linker of about 45 residues. Here we present the high-resolution NMR structure of domain 2, which consists of a five-stranded, anti-parallel β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices. Analysis of our data in conjunction with previous reports suggests a homodimeric model for the eEF1Bγ subunit. Implications in terms of the quaternary organization of the entire eEF1 complex are discussed. Expression and Purification of Full-length eEF1Bγ—A plasmid carrying the gene coding for human eEF1Bγ fused to an N-terminal His10 tag (pET16b/eEF1Bγ) was transformed into the E. coli expression strain BL21(DE3). Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 mg/liter carbenicillin. Target protein expression was induced by addition of 0.7 mm IPTG to mid-log phase cultures (OD600 ≅ 0.6). After 3.5 h of additional growth, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and stored at –80 °C. Thawed cells were disrupted by sonication and debris spun down at 18,500 rpm, 4 °C for 2 h in a Beckman J2-MC centrifuge using a JA-20 rotor. After adjustment of pH to 7.5 and addition of imidazole and KCl to a final concentration of 5 mm and 0.5 m, respectively, the supernatant was applied to a HiTrap Chelating resin (Amersham Biosciences) charged with Ni2+ ions. The column was washed with 20 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m KCl, and the protein was then eluted using 500 mm imidazole in the same buffer. Full-length eEF1Bγ was optionally further purified on Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) using 20 mm Hepes pH 7.2, 350 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, dialyzed into the appropriate buffer and concentrated in an Ultrafree-0.5 cartridge (Biomax-10, Millipore). Preparation of eEF1Bγ Domain 2 Fragment by Limited Proteolysis— The full-length protein was prepared as above except that for isotopic labeling cells were grown in M9-based minimal medium supplemented with trace levels of metal ions and vitamins plus 0.3 g/liter 15NH4Cl and either 2 g/liter 13C6-glucose or 4 g/liter unlabelled glucose (in the case of the 10% 13C-labeled sample, a 1:10 mixture of labeled and unlabeled glucose was used). Moreover, bacteria were allowed to grow for 5 h instead of 3.5 after induction with IPTG. eEF1Bγ-containing fractions obtained from the Ni2+ column were pooled and incubated on ice with trypsin (1/20, w/w, A grade, Calbiochem). After 2 h, the reaction was stopped using aprotinin (1:20, w/w, Merck) The crude proteolysis mixture was diluted with 4 volumes of cold water, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and loaded onto a SourceQ column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer at 4 °C. The domain 2 fragment was eluted using a 0.05–0.6 m KCl gradient. The protein was then dialyzed against the same buffer now containing 40 mm KCl in order to lower the salt content prior to concentration by reverse flow loading on a 1-ml Poros 20 HQ column. Further dialysis and concentration on Centricon MWCO 10 kDa (Millipore) yielded NMR samples containing ∼1 mm of domain 2 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT to which 0.02% NaN3 (w/v) and 5% D2O (v/v) were added. Preparation of eEF1Bγ Domain 1 Fragment—When necessary, the limited proteolysis conditions were adapted (lower trypsin concentration and shorter incubation time, to be tested for each different batch) to recover the fragment corresponding to domain 1 as well. The procedure used was the same as described above for domain 2 up to the point where the sample was loaded onto a SourceQ column (Amersham Biosciences). The domain 1 fragment was collected in the column flow-through, which was then diluted to adjust the buffer composition to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 500 mm KCl, 5 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The sample was then loaded on a Ni2+-charged HiTrap Chelating resin (Amersham Biosciences) 5-ml column. The column was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 500 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol containing 500 mm imidazole. Target protein fractions were pooled and dialyzed to obtain ∼1.5 mg/ml samples in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.02% NaN3 (w/v). Analytical Gel filtration and in Vitro Reconstitution Experiments— Analytical gel filtration was performed at room temperature on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 350 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT. Samples containing 100–500 μg of protein(s) were centrifuged before loading on the column. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5 ml fractions were collected. For reconstitution experiments, proteins were incubated together for 5 min on ice prior to loading. Native Gel Electrophoresis and RNA Binding Bandshift Assays— Either poly(A) RNA (Roche Applied Science), poly(C) (Amersham Biosciences) or poly(U) (Roche Diagnostics) was dissolved in water to prepare a 10 mg/ml stock solution. Appropriate amounts were mixed with 3–5 μg of human recombinant eEF1Bγ or fragments thereof (Fig. 1c). The resulting mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C prior to loading on a 5% acrylamide gel run under native conditions. NMR Spectroscopy and Resonance Assignment—All spectra were recorded at 25 °C either on Bruker DMX600, AV750 or Varian Inova 800MHz spectrometers. HNCACB (22Wittekind M. Mueller L. J. Magn. Reson.

Series B. 1994; 103: 203-216Crossref Scopus (836) Google Scholar) were recorded for through-bond sequential backbone resonance assignment. Side-chain resonance assignments were mostly obtained from three-dimensional 1H,13C HCCH-TOCSY and CCH-TOCSY experiments (27Kay L.E. Xu G.Y. Singer A.U. Muhandiram D.R. Formankay J.D. J. Magn. Reson. Series B. 1993; 101: 333-337Crossref Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Aromatic ring proton and carbon resonance assignments were derived from the combined analysis of a two-dimensional 13C,1H CT (constant time) -HMQC spectrum (Fig. 2) (28Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 428-435Google Scholar, 29Cavanagh J. Rance M. Annu. Rep. NMR Spectrosc. 1993; 27: 1-58Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and three-dimensional 13C,1H NOESY-HSQC (mixing time: 80 ms) plus HCCH-TOCSY spectra optimized for aromatic residue detection. Simultaneous analysis of three-dimensional 13C,1H NOESY-HSQC (mixing time: 80 ms), and 15N,1H NOESY-HSQC (mixing time: 150 ms) (30Pascal S.M. Muhandiram D.R. Yamazaki T. Formankay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. Series B. 1994; 103: 197-201Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar) spectra allowed confirmation and completion of the data. Except for this latter 15N-edited NOESY spectrum, all experiments were recorded using a single double isotope-labeled sample. Prochiral methyl group stereospecific assignments were obtained by examination of the relative cross-peak sign in a two-dimensional 13C,1H CT-HSQC spectrum (28Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 428-435Google Scholar) recorded on a sample prepared from cells grown using 90% [12C6]glucose/10% [13C6]glucose (31Neri D. Szyperski T. Otting G. Senn H. Wüthrich K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Spectral data were processed using NMR-Pipe (32Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar). Assignment and peak integration were performed using XEASY (33Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—Structure calculations were performed with the program CYANA (www.guentert.com) using the CANDID method (34Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) for the automated assignment of the cross-peaks in the three aforementioned NOESY spectra. The final structure calculations with CYANA were started from 100 conformers with random torsion angle values. Simulated annealing with 10,000 time steps per conformer was performed with torsion angle dynamics (35Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

The structure was validated using the program PROCHECK-NMR (38Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Figures were generated with MOLMOL (39Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). Data Bank Accession Number—The coordinates of the ensemble of 20 structures have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (accession code 1PBU). Chemical shift data are available from the BioMagResBank under accession number 5628. Characterization of Recombinant eEF1Bγ—The eEF1Bγ subunit of human elongation factor 1 (eEF1) carrying an N-terminal His tag was overexpressed in E. coli. The recombinant full-length protein was obtained in the soluble fraction and isolated in high yield (>20 mg/liter in LB medium) using metal affinity chromatography (Fig. 1a). When required, further purification was accomplished by size exclusion chromatography. Since the clone used carried a non-silent single point mutation in the eEF1Bγ coding gene (V289A) compared with the deposited sequence (NM_001404) (40Kumabe T. Sohma Y. Yamamoto T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the integrity of the protein as well as its ability to form a complex with eEF1Bα were checked through analytical gel filtration techniques (data not shown). The three-dimensional structure indicates that this residue is surface exposed and is not part of a potential interaction interface providing further support that the mutation is not disruptive (see below). Unlike the equivalent protein isolated from the brine shrimp Artemia (12Janssen G.M.C. Möller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the ∼50 kDa recombinant human eEF1Bγ was found to be highly soluble with no tendency toward hydrophobic behavior. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that isolation of the Artemia subunit required temporary treatment with denaturing agents that might have altered its biophysical properties. In contrast, purification of the recombinant human protein has been performed under conditions allowing the preservation of its native state. Attempts to crystallize the full-length human eEF1Bγ failed. Limited proteolysis was then used to select for structurally stable domains (Fig. 1a). In agreement with previous observations made on the Artemia eEF1Bα/eEF1Bγ complex (21van Damme H. Amons R. Janssen G. Möller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we found that the human eEF1Bγ subunit is comprised of two trypsin-resistant domains of ∼25 and 19 kDa respectively. Both domains were isolated independently and analyzed by a combination of in vitro reconstitution and gel filtration experiments (Fig. 1b). Whereas the full-length protein appeared to be either di- or trimeric (data not shown and Ref. 7Sheu G.T. Traugh J.A. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 191: 181-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 3M. G. Jeppesen, P. A. Ortiz, W. Shepard, T. G. Kinzy, J. Nyborg, and R. M. Andersen, submitted manuscript. each of the isolated domains was characterized by a retention time indicating that they were monomeric. While no interaction could be detected between them, the 25-kDa fragment (domain 1) was shown to bind eEF1Bα thereby indicating that it was derived from the N-terminal part of the intact protein (21van Damme H. Amons R. Janssen G. Möller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The smaller domain was identified as the C-terminal 162 residue fragment of eEF1Bγ (eEF1Bγ-(276–437), domain 2) based on Edman degradation sequencing and mass spectrometry data. This latter 19-kDa domain 2 turned out to be exceptionally resistant to further proteolysis, showing no sign of degradation after overnight incubation with trypsin (1:200 w/w, 0 °C) (Fig. 1a). Despite the unusually high stability and solubility properties demonstrated by the protein, only small plate-like crystals unsuitable for x-ray diffraction analysis could be obtained. On the other hand, the high level of dispersion evident in the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum prompted us to elucidate its solution structure using NMR. In an attempt to simplify the purification procedure, the isolated domain 2 was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli. Rather unexpectedly, the protein was largely present in inclusion bodies. Although preliminary results indicated that the recombinant domain 2 could be solubilized and renatured, expression in M9-based minimal medium turned out to be very low. As a result, isotopic labeling, which is required for structural analysis by NMR, would have been too inefficient. We reverted therefore to the production of domain 2 by tryptic digestion of isotopically labeled full-length eEF1Bγ (15N-labeled, 13C,15N-doubly labeled or 10% 13C-labeled). NMR data were recorded for resonance assignment and structure determination. It has recently been found that eEF1Bγ is a nonspecific RNA-binding protein (20Al Maghrebi M. Brulé H. Padkina M. Allen C. Holmes W.M. Zehner Z.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5017-5028Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) able to interact with poly(A) RNA.2 In order to investigate, which domain of the intact protein is involved in RNA binding, we repeated these experiments using our recombinant, purified proteins. The full-length human eEF1Bγ subunit was shown to bind poly(A) RNA using an acrylamide gel-based band-shift assay performed under non-denaturing conditions (Fig. 1c). The assay indicates that there are several eEF1Bγ molecules bound to a single RNA molecule. No bandshift is observed for either domain 2 or domain 1 alone (Fig. 1c) suggesting that neither of the two domains is sufficient by itself for poly(A) RNA binding. Binding of the full-length protein has also been observed with poly(C) and poly(U) RNA (data not shown). NMR Spectroscopy and Resonance Assignments—The high quality of the NMR data allowed us to obtain essentially complete 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shift assignments for the observable resonances (see Ref. 42Vanwetswinkel S. Kriek J. Andersen G.R. Dijk J. Siegal G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 26: 189-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), available from the BMRB under the accession number 5628 (42Vanwetswinkel S. Kriek J. Andersen G.R. Dijk J. Siegal G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 26: 189-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Most of the backbone resonances were derived from combined interactive analysis of through-bond connectivities in triple resonance NMR spectra recorded on a 13C,15N-double-labeled sample and semiautomatic sequence-specific assignment using the program MAPPER (43Güntert P. Salzmann M. Braun D. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Of the 155 non-proline amino acids, there are only a total of six residues for which no backbone amide proton resonance could be identified (Lys-277, Asp-278, His-282, Phe-336, Asn-366, and Phe-384) and three of these are located at the N terminus. As is commonly found in NMR studies of proteins, the resonance of the HN proton of the first N-terminal alanine (Ala-276) could not be detected. Side-chain amide resonances could be identified for all of the seven Gln residues and four out of the six Asn residues. Stereospecific assignments of prochiral methyl groups were obtained for six of the seven Val residues and all fourteen Leu residues. Despite the unusually high number of aromatic amino acids contained in the protein sequence (3 His, 7 Trp, 7 Tyr, and 16 Phe), assignment of the aryl groups was completed to ∼90%. An illustration of the complexity of the aromatic region is provided in Fig. 2, which presents the assigned two-dimensional 13C,1H CT-HMQC spectrum. The spectrum was recorded with a constant time period set so that the multiplicity of the carbons is indicated by the phase of the peak. However, not all of the aromatic proton and carbon chemical shifts could be identified for residues Phe-288, Phe-293, Phe-336, Phe-363, and Phe-423. Unusual chemical shifts were observed for the backbone amide protons of Asp-315, Ala-383, and Phe-384 resonating at 3.80, 4.81, and 4.17 ppm, respectively. Significantly upfield-shifted resonances were also detected for some aliphatic side-chain protons of Ala-383 and Phe-384 as well as for Phe-314 and Gly-433. These chemical shift perturbations are likely to originate from strong ring-current effects due to the location of all of these residues within two aromatic clusters described below. For 8 of 162 residues (Ser-338, Leu-341, Ile-342, Thr-343, Met-345, Gln-432, Gly-433, and Lys-434), a second backbone amide peak with intensity ∼15% of the main peak could be unambiguously assigned based on triple resonance NMR experiments. In the case of Gly-433, we were moreover able to detect an additional weaker signal for the alpha proton resonances on the 13C,1H NOESY-HSQC. The same type of minor resonances have been assigned to Phe-346, Gln-347, Arg-348, and Ile-435 based on 15N,1H NOESY-HSQC pattern comparison with the main signal. As sample homogeneity was confirmed by mass spectrometry, these extra peaks could derive from a minor species such as a homodimer of which a model is discussed below. Five additional weak 15N,1H HSQC peaks have been picked but could not be unambiguously identified. Possible assignments for these weaker peaks among the closest lying peaks from the main conformation were investigated. Two of the five peaks had likely resonance assignments that are consistent with"
https://openalex.org/W2059131541,"Signal transduction of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase is involved in developmental processes as well as in neoplastic transformation. Activation of RET initiates receptor autophosphorylation on specific tyrosines that act as docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Using the cytoplasmatic part of RET as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a novel SH2 and SH3 domain containing adaptor protein previously termed Grap-2/Grf40/GrpL/GRID and its murine homologue as Gads/Mona, respectively. This protein, predominantly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, is involved in signaling downstream of the T-cell receptor and the receptor for monocyte colony-stimulating factor. Here, we show that Grap-2 is also expressed in neuroendocrine tumors and cell lines known to bear mutated forms of RET. Endogenously expressed RET and Grap-2 coimmunoprecipitate from lysates of a medullary thyroid carcinoma cell line. Grap-2 directly associates with RET in pull-down experiments using in vitro translated proteins. Overexpression of Grap-2 inhibits RET-induced NF-kappaB activation, and cotransfection of Grap-2 significantly reduces focus formation induced by oncogenic RET in NIH 3T3 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that besides being involved in tyrosine kinase signaling in hematopoietic cells, Grap-2 plays a tissue-specific role as an inhibitor of RET mitogenic signaling."
