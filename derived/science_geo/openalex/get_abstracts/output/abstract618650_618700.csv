https://openalex.org/W2890840786,"Recent evidence challenges the widely held view that the hippocampus is specialized for episodic memory, by demonstrating that it also underpins the integration of information across experiences. Contemporary computational theories propose that these two contrasting functions can be accomplished by big-loop recurrence, whereby the output of the system is recirculated back into the hippocampus. We use ultra-high-resolution fMRI to provide support for this hypothesis, by showing that retrieved information is presented as a new input on the superficial entorhinal cortex-driven by functional connectivity between the deep and superficial entorhinal layers. Further, the magnitude of this laminar connectivity correlated with inferential performance, demonstrating its importance for behavior. Our findings offer a novel perspective on information processing within the hippocampus and support a unifying framework in which the hippocampus captures higher-order structure across experiences, by creating a dynamic memory space from separate episodic codes for individual experiences."
https://openalex.org/W2890283911,"Primary afferents are known to be inhibited by kappa opioid receptor (KOR) signaling. However, the specific types of somatosensory neurons that express KOR remain unclear. Here, using a newly developed KOR-cre knockin allele, viral tracing, single-cell RT-PCR, and ex vivo recordings, we show that KOR is expressed in several populations of primary afferents: a subset of peptidergic sensory neurons, as well as low-threshold mechanoreceptors that form lanceolate or circumferential endings around hair follicles. We find that KOR acts centrally to inhibit excitatory neurotransmission from KOR-cre afferents in laminae I and III, and this effect is likely due to KOR-mediated inhibition of Ca2+ influx, which we observed in sensory neurons from both mouse and human. In the periphery, KOR signaling inhibits neurogenic inflammation and nociceptor sensitization by inflammatory mediators. Finally, peripherally restricted KOR agonists selectively reduce pain and itch behaviors, as well as mechanical hypersensitivity associated with a surgical incision. These experiments provide a rationale for the use of peripherally restricted KOR agonists for therapeutic treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2890253829,"Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCC) and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPC) are among the most common cancers worldwide and are associated with high mortality and morbidity. The purpose of this study is to identify potential biomarkers to distinguish OCC/OPC from normal controls and to distinguish OCC patients with and without nodal metastasis. We tested saliva samples from 101 OCC, 58 OPC, and 35 normal controls using four analytical platforms (NMR, targeted aqueous by LC-MS/MS, global aqueous and global lipidomics by LC-Q-TOF). Samples from OCC and normal controls were divided into discovery and validation sets. Using linear regression adjusting for age, sex, race and experimental batches, we found the levels of two metabolites (glycine and proline) to be significantly different between OCC and controls (FDR < 0.1 for both discovery and validation sets) but did not find any appreciable differences in metabolite levels between OPC and controls or between OCC with and without nodal metastasis. Four metabolites, including glycine, proline, citrulline, and ornithine were associated with early stage OCC in both discovery and validation sets. Further study is warranted to confirm these results in the development of salivary metabolites as diagnostic markers."

Methods Linear mixed-effects models were used to model the relationship between excise taxes and prevalence of cigarette smoking in each state from 2001 through 2015. Results From 2001 through 2015, increases in state-level excise taxes were associated with declines in prevalence of cigarette smoking. The effect was strongest in young adults (age 18–24) and weakest in low-income individuals (<$25,000). Conclusions Despite the shrinking pool of current smokers, excise taxes remain a valuable tool in public-health efforts to reduce the prevalence of cigarette smoking. Policy implications States with high smoking prevalence may find increased excise taxes an effective measure to reduce population smoking prevalence. Since the effect is greatest in young adults, benefits of increased tax would likely accumulate over time by preventing new smokers in the pivotal young-adult years."
https://openalex.org/W2890917923,"Signaling events at membranes are often mediated by membrane lipid composition or membrane physical properties. These membrane properties could act either by favoring the membrane binding of downstream effectors or by modulating their activity. Several proteins can sense/generate membrane physical curvature (i.e. shape). However, the modulation of the activity of enzymes by a membrane's shape has not yet been reported. Here, using a cell-free assay with purified diacylglycerol kinase ϵ (DGKϵ) and liposomes, we studied the activity and acyl-chain specificity of an enzyme of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) cycle, DGKϵ. By systematically varying the model membrane lipid composition and physical properties, we found that DGKϵ has low activity and lacks acyl-chain specificity in locally flat membranes, regardless of the lipid composition. On the other hand, these enzyme properties were greatly enhanced in membrane structures with a negative Gaussian curvature. We also found that this is not a consequence of preferential binding of the enzyme to those structures, but rather is due to a curvature-mediated allosteric regulation of DGKϵ activity and acyl-chain specificity. Moreover, in a fine-tuned interplay between the enzyme and the membrane, DGKϵ favored the formation of structures with greater Gaussian curvature. DGKϵ does not bear a regulatory domain, and these findings reveal the importance of membrane curvature in regulating DGKϵ activity and acyl-chain specificity. Hence, this study highlights that a hierarchic coupling of membrane physical property and lipid composition synergistically regulates membrane signaling events. We propose that this regulatory mechanism of membrane-associated enzyme activity is likely more common than is currently appreciated."

The d-alanylation machinery includes two membrane proteins of unclear function, DltB and DltD, which are somehow involved in transfer of d-alanine from a carrier protein inside the cell to teichoic acids on the cell surface. Here, we probed the role of DltD in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus using both cell-based and biochemical assays. We first exploited a known synthetic lethal interaction to establish the essentiality of each gene in the DLT pathway for d-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and confirmed this by directly detecting radiolabeled d-Ala-LTA both in cells and in vesicles prepared from mutant strains of S. aureus. We developed a partial reconstitution of the pathway by using cell-derived vesicles containing DltB, but no other components of the d-alanylation pathway, and showed that d-alanylation of previously formed lipoteichoic acid in the DltB vesicles requires the presence of purified and reconstituted DltA, DltC, and DltD, but not of the LTA synthase LtaS. Finally, based on the activity of DltD mutants in cells and in our reconstituted system, we determined that Ser-70 and His-361 are essential for d-alanylation activity, and we propose that DltD uses a catalytic dyad to transfer d-alanine to LTA. In summary, we have developed a suite of assays for investigating the bacterial DLT pathway and uncovered a role for DltD in LTA d-alanylation.

https://openalex.org/W2891016252,"Dog ownership satisfaction relates to the quality of life of both owner and dog, and when seriously compromised may even lead to dog abandonment. Knowledge on determinants of dog ownership satisfaction is limited, obstructing solutions for promoting satisfaction, and here we quantified causes making dog owners less than very satisfied with their dog. We focused on the owner perceived relationship with the dog, unwanted dog behaviour, and dog obedience class attendance. The study population included only few seriously dissatisfied dog owners, preventing discrimination of multiple levels below ‘very satisfied’. Consequently, existing relationships in the entire population may have been missed or underestimated and the findings apply specifically to dog owners that are relatively contented with dog ownership. Nine hundred seventy-seven Dutch dog owners completed an online questionnaire and we found the probability of being very satisfied to associate with all three subscales of the Monash Dog Owner Relationship Scale. Most strongly with perceived costs of ownership and less so with shared activities between owner and dog, and perceived emotional closeness to the dog. Aggression and/or disobedience related directly to high perceived ownership costs and to an increased probability of being less than very satisfied. Interaction effects indicated that dog disobedience was less influential on ownership satisfaction at high levels of aggression. Surprisingly, dog ownership satisfaction was unrelated to dog obedience class attendance, raising questions about the effectiveness of these classes in establishing satisfying dog-owner relationships. Training aids used during classes could play a role here, as choke chain use associated with high perceived costs and increased probabilities of being less then very satisfied with dog ownership. Ownership satisfaction in relatively contented dog owners, seems more influenced by unwanted dog behaviour and perceived costs of ownership, than by perceived emotional closeness to the dog, shared activities and dog obedience class attendance."
https://openalex.org/W2889859616,"Background and objectives Microneedling therapy is a widely used technique in dermatology. However, little is known about the underlying molecular effects of this therapy on extracellular matrix remodeling, wound healing, and inflammation. The aim of this study was to examine morphological and molecular changes caused by microneedling treatment in a standardized in vitro full-thickness 3D model of human skin. Materials and methods A microneedling device was used to treat full-thickness 3D skin models. Specimens were harvested at specified time points and qRT-PCR and microarray studies were performed. Frozen sections were examined histologically. Results Microneedling treatment caused morphological changes in the skin model resulting in an almost complete recovery of the epidermis five days after treatment. Microarray analysis identified an upregulation of genes that are associated with tissue remodeling and wound healing (e.g. COL3A1, COL8A1, TIMP3), epithelial proliferation and differentiation (KRT13, IGF1), immune cell recruitment (CCL11), and a member of the heat shock protein family (HSPB6). On the other hand, we detected a downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL1α, IL1β, IL24, IL36γ, IL36RN), and antimicrobial peptides (e.g. S100A7A, DEFB4). These data were confirmed by independent RT-PCR analyses. Conclusion We present for the first time the direct molecular effects of microneedling therapy on epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts using a standardized 3D skin model. Treatment resulted in histological alterations and changed the expression of various genes related to epidermal differentiation, inflammation, and dermal remodeling. This data suggests that skin microneedling plays a role in dermal remodeling, increases epidermal differentiation, and might also have a direct effect on collagen synthesis. These findings may increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of human skin repair induced by microneedling therapy and will allow comparisons with competing applications, such as ablative laser therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2889651192,"Salmonella species is an important foodborne pathogen with the non-typhoidal serovars such as Enteritidis and Typhimurium as the most predominant strains. This study examines the biofilm formation, phenotypic virulence factors and cell surface characteristics of Salmonella strains from ready-to-eat shrimps. The ready-to-eat shrimps were obtained from open markets between November 2016 and October 2017 in Edo and Delta States, Nigeria. The occurrence of Salmonella strains in this study was 210/1440 (14.58%) of the ready-to-eat shrimp’s samples. The identified strains comprise of Salmonella Enteritidis 11, Salmonella Typhimurium 14 and other Salmonella spp. 20. The 45 identified Salmonella strains revealed the following virulence properties: swimming and swarming motility 45(100%); S-layer 39(86.67%); haemolytic activity 40(88.89%); lipase activity 43(95.56%); protease activity 43(95.56%); gelatinase production 43(95.56%); and DNA degrading activity 41(91.11%). The variation in the formation of biofilm-based on the diversity of Salmonella species was observed with higher percentage of Salmonella Typhimurium strains as strong biofilms producers under different environmental conditions. For surface hydrophobicity using bacterial adherence to hydrocarbons, 25(55.56%) were hydrophilic while 20(44.44%) were moderately hydrophobic from the 45 Salmonella isolates. Using salting aggregation test for surface hydrophobicity, all selected isolates 45(100%) was hydrophilic. Autoaggregation index for the 12 selected Salmonella isolates ranged from 15.2–47.2%, while the autoaggragation index for the 12 selected test bacteria ranged from 26.2–71.3%. Coaggragation between the 12 selected test bacteria and 12 Salmonella isolates ranged from 12.5–81.0%. The occurrence of pathogenic species of Salmonella from ready-to-eat shrimps could be detrimental to the consumers. Findings on the physiological conditions of biofilms formed by the foodborne pathogenic Salmonella and the cell surface characteristics therein are crucial for the advancement of methods for controlling Salmonella from ready-to-eat foods."

It is well-known for its ability to infect almost all nucleated vertebrate cells, which is reflected by its unique metabolic architecture. Its fast-growing tachyzoite stage catabolizes glucose via glycolysis to yield l-lactate as a major by-product that must be exported from the cell to prevent toxicity; the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated, however. Herein, we report three formate–nitrite transporter (FNT)–type monocarboxylate/proton symporters located in the plasma membrane of the T. gondii tachyzoite stage. We observed that all three proteins transport both l-lactate and formate in a pH-dependent manner and are inhibited by 2-hydroxy-chromanones (a class of small synthetic molecules). We also show that these compounds pharmacologically inhibit T. gondii growth. Using a chemical biology approach, we identified the critical residues in the substrate-selectivity region of the parasite transporters that determine differential specificity and sensitivity toward both substrates and inhibitors. Our findings further indicate that substrate specificity in FNT family proteins from T. gondii has evolved such that a functional repurposing of prokaryotic-type transporters helps fulfill a critical metabolic role in a clinically important parasitic protist. In summary, we have identified and characterized the lactate transporters of T. gondii and have shown that compounds blocking the FNTs in this parasite can inhibit its growth, suggesting that these transporters could have utility as potential drug targets.

https://openalex.org/W2890440094,"Meningiomas are stratified according to tumor grade and extent of resection, often in isolation of other clinical variables. Here, we use machine learning (ML) to integrate demographic, clinical, radiographic and pathologic data to develop predictive models for meningioma outcomes.We developed a comprehensive database containing information from 235 patients who underwent surgery for 257 meningiomas at a single institution from 1990 to 2015. The median follow-up was 4.3 years, and resection specimens were re-evaluated according to current diagnostic criteria, revealing 128 WHO grade I, 104 grade II and 25 grade III meningiomas. A series of ML algorithms were trained and tuned by nested resampling to create models based on preoperative features, conventional postoperative features, or both. We compared different algorithms' accuracy as well as the unique insights they offered into the data. Machine learning models restricted to preoperative information, such as patient demographics and radiographic features, had similar accuracy for predicting local failure (AUC = 0.74) or overall survival (AUC = 0.68) as models based on meningioma grade and extent of resection (AUC = 0.73 and AUC = 0.72, respectively). Integrated models incorporating all available demographic, clinical, radiographic and pathologic data provided the most accurate estimates (AUC = 0.78 and AUC = 0.74, respectively). From these models, we developed decision trees and nomograms to estimate the risks of local failure or overall survival for meningioma patients.Clinical information has been historically underutilized in the prediction of meningioma outcomes. Predictive models trained on preoperative clinical data perform comparably to conventional models trained on meningioma grade and extent of resection. Combination of all available information can help stratify meningioma patients more accurately."
https://openalex.org/W2890460021,"Here, we present a mechanistically grounded theory detailing a novel function of the behavioral immune system (BIS), the psychological system that prompts pathogen avoidance behaviors. We propose that BIS activity allows the body to downregulate basal inflammation, preventing resultant oxidative damage to DNA and promoting longevity. Study 1 investigated the relationship between a trait measure of pathogen avoidance motivation and in vitro and in vivo proinflammatory cytokine production. Study 2 examined the relationship between this same predictor and DNA damage often associated with prolonged inflammation. Results revealed that greater trait pathogen avoidance motivation predicts a) lower levels of spontaneous (but not stimulated) proinflammatory cytokine release by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), b) lower plasma levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), and c) lower levels of oxidative DNA damage. Thus, the BIS may promote health by protecting the body from the deleterious effects of inflammation and oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2890391722,"Antimalarial drug resistance is a major constraint for malaria control and elimination efforts. Artemisinin-based combination therapy is now the mainstay for malaria treatment. However, delayed parasite clearance following treatment with artemisinin derivatives has now spread in the Greater Mekong Sub region and may emerge or spread to other malaria endemic regions. This spread is of great concern for malaria control programmes, as no alternatives to artemisinin-based combination therapies are expected to be available in the near future. There is a need to strengthen surveillance systems for early detection and response to the antimalarial drug resistance threat. Current surveillance is mainly done through therapeutic efficacy studies; however these studies are complex and both time- and resource-intensive. For multiple common antimalarials, parasite drug resistance has been correlated with specific genetic mutations, and the molecular markers associated with antimalarial drug resistance offer a simple and powerful tool to monitor the emergence and spread of resistant parasites. Different techniques to analyse molecular markers associated with antimalarial drug resistance are available, each with advantages and disadvantages. However, procedures are not adequately harmonized to facilitate comparisons between sites. Here we describe the target product profiles for tests to analyse molecular markers associated with antimalarial drug resistance, discuss how use of current techniques can be standardised, and identify the requirements for an ideal product that would allow malaria endemic countries to provide useful spatial and temporal information on the spread of resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2891129896,"In domestic cats, the AB blood group system consists of the three types A, B, and C (usually called AB), which vary in frequency among breeds and geographic regions. Mismatches cause acute hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemolysis of the newborn due to the presence of naturally occurring anti-A alloantibodies. Cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) converts N-acetylneuraminic acid (type B) to N-glycolylneuraminic acid (type A), and type C erythrocytes express both antigens. We examined the feline CMAH coding regions and genotyped cats to characterize type A, B, and C animals. Of 421 phenotypically typed cats, 60% were A, 35% B and 5% C. Among the 70 cats for which the CMAH coding region was sequenced, 13 new variants were identified in addition to 16 of the previously reported 18 variants. The CMAH variant c.268T>A is seen in type B cats of most breeds, and the variant c.179G>T results in type B in Turkish breeds. The variants c.1322delT and c.933delA cause frameshifts with early stop codons and thereby type B in some Ragdolls and domestic shorthair cats, respectively. Protein modeling with PROVEAN affirmed their deleterious effects. No type A and C cats had more than one allele with one of the above variants. Variant analysis of three SNVs (c.142G>A, c.268T>A and Δ-53) and blood typing of an additional 351 typed cats showed complete phenotype-genotype concordance. In conclusion, the three CMAH variants c.179G>T, c.268T>A and c.1322delT are the main reasons for the defective NeuGc synthesis causing blood type B in domestic purebred and non-pedigreed cats. Together with the variant c.364C>T for type C in Ragdolls they offer a molecular screening scheme for clinical diagnostics to assure blood type compatibility."

We further validated this substrate profile against brain membrane lysates generated from WT and ABHD12 knockout mice. Finally, using cellular organelle fractionation and immunofluorescence assays, we show that mammalian ABHD12 is enriched on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where most of the very-long-chain fatty acids are biosynthesized in cells.

https://openalex.org/W2890217350,"With climate change and an ever-increasing human population threatening food security, developing a better understanding of the genetic basis of crop performance under stressful conditions has become increasingly important. Here, we used genome-wide association studies to genetically dissect variation in seedling growth traits in cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) under well-watered and water-limited (i.e., osmotic stress) conditions, with a particular focus on root morphology. Water limitation reduced seedling size and produced a shift toward deeper rooting. These effects varied across genotypes, and we identified 13 genomic regions that were associated with traits of interest across the two environments. These regions varied in size from a single marker to 186.2 Mbp and harbored numerous genes, some of which are known to be involved in the plant growth/development as well as the response to osmotic stress. In many cases, these associations corresponded to growth traits where the common allele outperformed the rare variant, suggesting that selection for increased vigor during the evolution of cultivated sunflower might be responsible for the relatively high frequency of these alleles. We also found evidence of pleiotropy across multiple traits, as well as numerous environmentally independent genetic effects. Overall, our results indicate the existence of genetic variation in root morphology and allocation and further suggest that the majority of alleles associated with these traits have consistent effects across environments."

Population relationships within five Han Chinese population groups (1344 individuals), between Guizhou Han and other 19 Chinese reference populations belonging to four language families (5074 individuals), as well as between Meta-Han Chinese and other 15 minorities (3730 individuals) were performed using Reynolds’s, Nei’s and Fst genetic distances, principal component analysis (PCA), multidimensional scaling (MDS), Structure and Neighbor-Joining tree. Mean paternity exclusion chance (MEC) in Duos > 0.99999999453588 and in trios > 0.99999999999781, as well as power of discrimination (PD) > 0.99999999999980 in Guizhou Han on the basis of allele frequencies. Consistent high MECs and PDs can be observed in Meta-Han Chinese population based on both allele diversities of 19 markers and haplotype diversities of seven linkage groups (LG).

However, the points needed to remain in the category have been an element that has not been analysed previously. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of match location, match period, strength of the opponent and the points required to keep category on physical performance in professional soccer players. Fourteen Spanish second B Division League matches played by a professional football team were analysed during the 2016/17 season using GPS devices. The 10 main players of each match used the GPS throughout the match. The variables of Total Distance (m), High Intensity Distance (m), High intensity Accelerations (n), Sprint Time (s) and Sprint Distance (m) were analysed. The most notable differences are found in Total Distance covered. Away games accumulated significantly more distance than those played at home, but only in the second half (+230.65 m, IC95%: 21.94 to 438.19, ES: 0.46, p = 0.031). There are no differences depending on the strength of the opponent. However, players covered greater distances during the first half in those matches that were played furthest from salvation (+235.86 m, 95% CI: 49.03 to 422.70, ES: 0.51, p = 0.014). Total Distance is the main parameter affected by situational variables. In addition, the pressure of being further away from saving the category increases the distance covered by players in a game."
https://openalex.org/W2891613433,"Background Hypertension has been identified as the single greatest contributor to the global burden of disease and mortality, with estimates suggesting that the highest levels of blood pressure have shifted from high-income countries to low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. While evidence suggests a remarkably high prevalence of hypertension among urban residents in Namibia, national estimates to inform on the country-level burden are lacking. This study estimates the prevalence and predictors of hypertension among Namibian adults. Methods The analysis is based on 1,795 women and 1,273 men aged 35–64 years from the nationally-representative 2013 Namibia Demographic and Health Survey. Odds radios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using logistic regression. Results The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension was 46.0% (men vs. women: 46.1% vs. 46.0%). Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures for the total population were 128.8 mmHg (95% CI 127.8–129.7) and 83.1 mmHg (95% CI 82.5–83.7), respectively. Mean systolic blood pressure was significantly lower among women (men vs. women: 130.9 mmHg vs. 127.4 mmHg; p<0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in mean diastolic blood pressure between men and women. Older age, urban residence, and being either overweight or obese were positively associated with the odds of hypertension (p<0.01). For women, the odds of hypertension were also significantly increased for those who were diabetic (i.e. had a fasting blood glucose level greater than 7.0 mmol/L) and reduced for those with higher levels of education. Conclusion The prevalence of hypertension among Namibian adults is high and associated with metabolic and socio-demographic factors. Future research examining disease comorbidity and behavioral risk factors could better inform on the disease burden and help target resources to optimize prevention and control."
https://openalex.org/W2892230078,"Phosphoinositide phospholipases C (PLCs) are a family of eukaryotic intracellular enzymes with important roles in signal transduction. In addition to their location at the plasma membrane, PLCs also exist within the cell nucleus where they are stored. We previously demonstrated that OSBP-related protein 4L (ORP4L) anchors cluster of differentiation 3ɛ (CD3ɛ) to the heterotrimeric G protein subunit (Gαq/11) to control PLCβ3 relocation and activation. However, the underlying mechanism by which ORP4L facilitates PLCβ3 translocation remains unknown. Here, using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation assays, we report that ORP4L stimulates PLCβ3 translocation from the nucleus to the plasma membrane in Jurkat T-cells in two steps. First, we found that ORP4L is required for the activation of Ras-related nuclear protein (RAN), a GTP-binding nuclear protein that binds to exportin 1 and eventually promotes the nuclear export of PLCβ3. Second, we also observed that ORP4L interacts with vesicle-associated membrane protein–associated protein A (VAPA) through its two phenylalanines in an acidic tract (FFAT) motif. This complex enabled PLCβ3 movement to the plasma membrane, indicating that PLCβ3 translocation occurs in a VAPA-dependent manner. This study reveals detailed mechanistic insight into the role of ORP4L in PLCβ3 redistribution from storage within the nucleus to the plasma membrane via RAN activation and interaction with VAPA in Jurkat T-cells."
https://openalex.org/W2890949134,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans. CCHFV is widely distributed in more than 30 countries and distinct regions, which means that it poses a serious threat to human health. The nucleocapsid protein (NP) encoded by the CCHFV S gene is the primary detectable antigen in infected cells, which makes it an important viral antigen and a clinical diagnostic target. In this study, the modified biosynthetic peptide (BSP) method was used to identify the fine epitopes on the N- and C- terminals of NP from the CCHFV YL04057 strain using rabbit antiserum against CCHFV-NP. Nine epitopes were identified: E1a (178NLILNRGG185), E1b (184GGDENP189), E2 (352PLKWGKK358), E3 (363FADDS367), E4 (399NPDDAA404), E5a (447DIVASEHL454), E5b (452EHLLHQSL459), E6 (464SPFQNAY470) and E7 (475NATSANII482). Western blotting analysis showed that each epitope interacted with the positive serum of sheep that had been naturally infected with CCHFV. Amino acid sequence alignment between each epitope and their homologous proteins showed that they were almost 100% conserved among 12 CCHFV sequences from different lineages, except for epitopes E1a, E1b and E2. Three-dimensional structural modeling analysis showed that all identified epitopes were located on the surface of the NP ""head"" domain. This study identified fine epitopes on the N- and C- terminals of NP, which will increase the understanding of the structure and function of NP, and it could lay the foundation for the design and development of a CCHFV multi-epitope peptide vaccine and detection antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2891350848,"We had previously reported that exchange protein for cAMP 1 (Epac1) reduced inflammatory mediators in the retina of mice and in retinal endothelial cells (REC). Since ischemia can induce retinal damage potentially through activation of inflammatory cascades, we hypothesized that Epac1 would protect the retina against neuronal and vascular damage after exposure to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). We used Epac1 floxed and endothelial cell specific Epac1 knockout mice for this work. We exposed them to ischemia for 90 minutes followed by reperfusion. One day after I/R, some mice were used for fluorescein angiography imaging or Evan's blue measurements of permeability. Mice were sacrificed at 2 days for neuronal measurements and at 10 days for measurements of degenerate capillaries. Data show increased leakage in the Epac1 Cre-Lox (Epac1 EC-KO) mice exposed to I/R when compared to Epac1 floxed mice with the same treatment. I/R also increased numbers of degenerate capillaries and cell loss in all retinal layers of Epac1 EC-KO mice. Retinal thickness was reduced more significantly in the Epac1 EC-KO mice compared to Epac1 floxed mice after I/R. Taken together, the data suggest that Epac1 is protective against both neuronal and vascular damage to the retina after exposure to I/R."
https://openalex.org/W2891132783,"Altered systemic redox status is often observed in lung cancer. However, detailed information on factors other, than smoking, which influence this perturbation is rather scarce. Elevated oxidative stress has been linked with disturbances in glucose metabolism before, but such associations have not been investigated in lung cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between systemic parameters of glucose metabolism and redox status in lung cancer patients (LC). Biochemical variables related to circulating glucose, i.e. glucose, insulin, c-peptide, fructosamine (FA), and glucose metabolism, i.e. β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), lactate (LACT), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), as well as redox status i.e. total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) were determined for LC (n = 122) and control subjects (CS) (n = 84). HOMA-IR and the oxidative stress index (OSI) were calculated. LC patients had an altered redox status and glucose metabolism compared to CS. Positive correlations in LC were observed between TOS, OSI and circulating glucose as well as FA, while TAS positively correlated with BHB and NEFAs. In contrast, in metastatic LC, NEFAs and BHB positively correlated with OSI. Smoking status additionally stratified the observed relationships. In conclusion, we found that parameters related to circulating glucose or non-enzymatic glycation were correlated with oxidative stress (TOS and OSI), while metabolites such as BHB and NEFAs were correlated with antioxidant capacity (TAS). Metastasis prevalence and smoking seem to influence these correlations. However, the detailed mechanism of this relationship requires further research, in particular as regards the surprising positive correlation between NEFAs and TAS."
https://openalex.org/W2890379733,"Species assemblages can result from deterministic processes, such as niche differentiation and interspecific interactions, and from stochastic processes, such as random colonisation and extinction events. Although changes in animal communities following disturbances have been widely examined, few studies have investigated the mechanisms structuring communities during ecological succession. We assessed the impact of logging on small mammal and beetle assemblages in landscapes dominated by old-growth boreal forests. Our objectives were to 1) characterize variations in communities during the first 66 years of post-harvest forest succession, 2) determine if there are non-random patterns of species co-occurrence (i.e., deterministic processes), and if there are, 3) establish whether non-random co-occurrences are best explained by habitat attributes or by interspecific interactions. We captured small mammals and beetles along a gradient of forest succession (5–66 years) and in old-growth forest, and characterized key vegetation attributes. First, we tested whether community compositions in clear-cut stands became similar to those in natural stands after 66 years. We then used null models, which were either unconstrained or constrained by habitat attributes, to address the last two objectives and distinguish effects of vegetation attributes from interspecific interactions on community assembly. We showed that beetle assemblages differed in stands 21–30 years post-harvest compared to old-growth forests. In contrast, harvesting did not influence the composition of small mammal communities. Overall, our results suggest that community assembly during forest succession is driven by both stochastic and deterministic processes, the latter being linked to interspecific interactions more strongly than to vegetation attributes."

However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. The present study aimed to assesswhether aging patients exhibit an activated DNA double-strandbreak (DSB) repair pathway in cumulus cells and thus, an association with poor outcomes after in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) treatment. Cumulus cells from young (≤29 y) and aging (≥37 y) human female patients were collected after oocyte retrieval. Our results indicated that aging patients showed a higher rate of γ-H2AX-positive cells than in young patients (24.33±4.55 vs.12.40±2.31, P<0.05). We also found that the mRNA expression levels of BRCA1, ATM, MRE11 and RAD51 were significantly elevated in aging cumulus cells. Accordingly, significantly increased protein levels of phospho-H2AX, BRCA1, ATM, MRE11 and RAD51 could be observed in aging cumulus cells. Moreover, aging cumulus cells showed a more frequent occurrence of early apoptosis than young cumulus cells. This study found that increases in DSBs and the activation of the repair pathway are potential indicators that may be used to predictoutcomes after IVF-ET treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2891030861,"Coxsackievirus A2 (CV-A2) has emerged as an important etiological agent in the hand, foot, and mouth disease and herpangina pathogen spectrum because of its high global prevalence. In the present study, we investigated the evolutionary dynamics of CV-A2 circulating in China. We analyzed a total of 163 entire VP1 sequences of CV-A2, including 74 sequences generated from the present study and 89 sequences collected from the GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis based on the entire VP1 nucleotide sequences confirmed the persistent circulation of the predominant genotype D in mainland of China since 2008. Cluster analysis grouped the sequences into two distinct clusters, clusters 1 and 2, with most grouped under cluster 2. After 2012, cluster 1 was gradually replaced by cluster 2. Results of Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis suggested that multiple lineages of genotype D were transmitted in mainland of China at an estimated evolutionary rate of 6.32×10(-3) substitutions per site per year, which is consistent with the global evolutionary rate of CV-A2 (5.82×10(-3) substitutions per site per year). Continuous transmission and evolution of CV-A2 resulted in the genetic polymorphism."
https://openalex.org/W2891143697,"Pollination success is important for crop yield, but may be cultivar dependent. Less is known about which floral traits influence pollination success. Floral traits, e.g. traits related to attraction and reward, can also contribute to gene flow via pollen, the latter being of particular importance in oilseed rape (Brassica napus) where gene flow occurs between plants of crop, volunteer and feral origin as well as related taxa. We investigated the relationship between pollen load size and seed set in winter oilseed rape. We compared variability in pollen-viability traits, flower production (flowers from the main raceme times number of branches) and seed number and weight per siliqua among cultivars and feral populations (growing outside of agricultural fields) under controlled conditions. Both seed number and weight were saturated at relatively low pollen loads in the tested cultivar. Pollen viability and estimated flower production differed among cultivars, indicating that these traits could contribute to yield variability. Seed weight per siliqua, but not pollen traits or flower production, was lower in ferals compared to cultivars. Thus, while the probability of establishment may be reduced in ferals (due to lower seed weight per siliqua) this will not necessarily impact their contribution to gene flow via pollen. In oilseed rape a relatively low pollen load may be sufficient for full seed set in some cultivars, suggesting less dependence on insect pollination for high yield than generally expected. Our results also showed that previously less investigated floral traits, such as pollen viability, pollen tube growth rate and flower number, can differ between cultivars. Studies of these traits may provide targets for increasing crop yield and provide general knowledge about gene flow between cultivated, feral and related wild populations."
https://openalex.org/W2889728690,"In contrast to the successful preparation of phosphate for oxygen isotope analysis from water samples, there are still a series of problems for similar analyses from soils and sediments. Here, we improved and optimized the methods of silver phosphate preparation for oxygen isotope analysis from soils and sediments. During our preparations, organic matter was removed by sodium hypochlorite and XAD-2 resin, while the impurities of elemental silver and its oxide were removed by rapid microprecipitation and ammonium phospho-molybdate and magnesium ammonium phosphate. The total organic carbon and total nitrogen in the prepared silver phosphates from soils and sediments were 0.226±0.033% and 0.030±0.0059% (n = 7), 0.217±0.053% and 0.034±0.0120% (n = 9), respectively, indicating a high removal efficiency of organic matter. We confirmed that adding citric acid during rapid microprecipitation would introduce the impurity of elemental silver, which could be removed by ammonia recrystallization. The pH range of solutions for rapid microprecipitation was optimized at 7.0‒7.5. Results of X-ray Diffraction and stable oxygen isotope analyses showed that the improved method could obtain high pure silver phosphate from soil and sediment samples without oxygen isotope fractionation. This improved procedure provides a foundation for biogeochemical studies on phosphorus in soil and lacustrine environments by using phosphate oxygen isotopes."
https://openalex.org/W2891649531,"Sign languages use the horizontal plane to refer to discourse referents introduced at referential locations. However, the question remains whether the assignment of discourse referents follows a particular default pattern as recently proposed such that two new discourse referents are respectively assigned to the right (ipsilateral) and left (contralateral) side of (right handed) signers. The present event-related potential study on German Sign Language investigates the hypothesis that signers assign distinct and contrastive referential locations to discourse referents even in the absence of overt localization. By using a semantic mismatch-design, we constructed sentence sets where the second sentence was either consistent or inconsistent with the used pronoun. Semantic mismatch conditions evoked an N400, whereas a contralateral index sign engendered a Phonological Mismatch Negativity. The current study provides supporting evidence that signers are sensitive to the mismatch and make use of a default pattern to assign distinct and contrastive referential locations to discourse referents."

The contributions of 137Cs-enriched particles to 137Cs concentrations in sediment samples ranged from 9% to 64%. These experiments revealed that the variability of 137Cs concentrations was due mainly to the heterogeneous distribution of 137Cs-enriched particles in the samples. Therefore, the heterogeneous distribution of 137Cs-enriched particles is probably one of the main factors responsible for the temporal and spatial variations of 137Cs concentrations in sediment samples."
https://openalex.org/W2890699112,"The use of reference genes is required for relative quantification in gene expression analysis and since the stability of these genes could be variable depending on the experimental design, it has become indispensable to test the reliability of endogenous genes. Therefore, this study evaluated 10 reference candidate genes in two different experimental conditions in order to obtain stable genes to be used as reference in expression studies related to scrotal hernias in pigs. Two independent experiments were performed: one with 30 days-old MS115 pigs and the other with 60 days-old Landrace pigs. The inguinal ring/canal was collected, frozen and further submitted to real-time PCR analysis (qPCR). For the reference genes stability evaluation, four tools were used: GeNorm in the SLqPCR, BestKeeper, NormFinder and Comparative CT. A general ranking was generated using the BruteAggreg function of R environment. In this study, the RPL19 was one of the most reliable endogenous genes for both experiments. The breed/age effects influenced the expression stability of candidate reference genes evaluated in the inguinal ring of pigs. Therefore, this study reinforces the importance of evaluating the stability of several endogenous genes previous their use, since a consensual set of reference genes is not easily obtained. Here, two sets of genes are recommended: RPL19, RPL32 and H3F3A for 30-days MS115 and PPIA and RPL19 for the 60 days-old Landrace pigs. This is the first study using the inguinal ring tissue and the results can be useful as an indicative for other studies working with gene expression in this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2891103178,"A two-year rotation of summer fallow (SF)/winter wheat (WW) is the most common cropping system in low precipitation areas of the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW). In SF, multiple tillage operations are used to manage weeds and maximize soil water storage and potential WW yield. Reduced tillage fallow (RTF) is an alternative to SF that leaves >30% of the previous crop’s residue on the surface. A four-year (2014–18) field study was conducted to evaluate the influence of SF and RTF on weed species density, cover and composition in dryland WW; determine if changes in these weed infestation attributes have any influence on crop density and yield; and evaluate economic costs of each type of fallow management. The experimental design was randomized complete block with four replications where each phase of SF/WW and RTF/WW rotations was present every year. Individual plots of WW were divided into a weedy sub-plot with no weed control, general area with chemical weed control, and weed-free sub-plot where weeds were manually removed. Infestations of annual grass and other weeds in weedy sub-plots increased throughout the study. Grass weed cover, consisting mainly of downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.), and total weed cover were significantly lower in WW following RTF than following SF in all years except 2018. Densities of grass and total weeds were similar in both fallow managements indicating that weed plants were larger in WW following SF than following RTF due to earlier or faster emergence. Grass cover differences were not found in general areas likely because of a reduced seedbank. When weeds were present, mean yield of WW was higher following RTF than SF indicating that weeds were less competitive in RTF. Reduced tillage fallow could improve weed management in fallow/WW cropping systems of the PNW compared to SF/WW, particularly if the most problematic species are grasses."
https://openalex.org/W2891267708,"Multi-focus image fusion is an effective approach to obtain the all-in-focus image. Focus detection is the key issue of multi-focus image fusion. Aiming at the shortcoming of spatial domain and transform domain algorithms for multi-focus image fusion, a novel multi-focus image fusion algorithm is proposed by combing focus detection in spatial domain and non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain. At first, the focused pixels are detected by the sum-modified-Laplacian algorithm in spatial domain. At the same time, the focus detection method is proposed in NSCT domain, namely by MPCNN and voting fusion methods for high-frequency subbands of NSCT. Then, the morphological operation is utilized to correct the focus detection results in spatial domain and NSCT domain. At last, synthesis of detection results is implemented and the fused image can be obtained. Experimental results verified that the proposed algorithm outperformed some state-of-the-art fusion algorithms in terms of both subjective observation and objective evaluations."
https://openalex.org/W2889589644,"Bone is a common site of metastasis for breast cancer and the mechanisms of metastasis are not fully elucidated. The purpose of our study was to characterize temporal and molecular dynamics of adhesive interactions between human breast cancer cells (HBCC) and human bone marrow endothelium (HBME) with piconewton resolution using atomic force microscopy (AFM). In adhesion experiments, a single breast cancer cell, MDA-MB-231 (MB231) or MDA-MB-435 (MB435) was attached to the AFM cantilever and brought into contact with a confluent HBME monolayer for different time periods (0.5 to 300 sec). The forces required to rupture individual molecular interactions and completely separate interacting cells were analyzed as measures of cell-cell adhesion. Adhesive interactions between HBME and either MB231 or MB435 cells increased progressively as cell-cell contact time was prolonged from 0.5 to 300 sec due to the time-dependent increase in the number and frequency of individual adhesive events, as well as to the involvement of stronger ligand-receptor interactions over time. Studies of the individual molecule involvement revealed that Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (TF-Ag), galectin-3, integrin-β1, and integrin-α3 are all contributing to HBCC/HBME adhesion to various degrees in a temporally defined fashion. In conclusion, cell-cell contact time enhances adhesion of HBCC to HBME and the adhesion is mediated, in part, by TF-Ag, galectin-3, integrin-α3, and integrin-β1."

This study aims to assess relationships among physical function, social factors, psychological factors, quality of life (QOL) and self-efficacy, and the effects of these variables on self-efficacy among NSCLC patients. Methods A cross-sectional survey was administered to 238 postsurgical NSCLC patients (response rate 95.2%) at five tertiary hospitals in Fuzhou, China. the participants completed a pack of questionnaires. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to test the hypothetical model. Results The SEM results supported the hypothesized structural model (χ2/df = 1.511, p>0.05). The final model showed that confrontation coping, subjective well-being (SWB), social support, psychological growth (PTG) and anxiety and depression can be directly related to self-efficacy (coefficient = 0.335, coefficient = 0.288, coefficient = 0.150, coefficient = 0.024, and coefficient = -0.004, respectively, p<0.01). Confrontation coping also had indirect effect via SWB (coefficient = 0.085, p<0.01), which had indirect connection via PTG (coefficient = 0.005, p<0.01). Social support and anxiety and depression had indirect pathways as well. As expected, self-efficacy directly affected the quality of life. Conclusions This study suggests that higher confrontation coping style, SWB, social support, and PTG and lower anxiety and depression levels could effectively enhance their self-efficacy and consequently, improve QOL. These findings may help develop an intervention aimed at enhancing self-efficacy for this patient population."
https://openalex.org/W2891494314,"Most teachers have a high risk of work-related stress and mental disorders. Drunken driving and hazardous alcohol consumption (HAC) among teachers are social problems. Gender differences among teachers in burnout, occupational stress, self-efficacy and job satisfaction were reported. This study aimed to clarify gender differences in the relationships between perceived individual-level occupational stress and HAC among Japanese teachers. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2013 and a total of 723 male and 476 female teachers remained after excluding non-drinkers. Perceived individual-level occupational stress was assessed using the Generic Job Stress Questionnaire. HAC was defined as ethanol consumption greater than or equal to 280 g in 1 week for male teachers, and greater than or equal to 210 g for female teachers. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted. HAC was identified in 16.6% of male and 12.4% of female teachers. The average ages (± standard deviation: SD) of male and female teachers were 46.9 ± 10.9 years and 39.9 ± 12.3 years, respectively. Schoolteacher was the most common position classification among male (48.7%) and female teachers (86.3%). For those with a moderate level of stress, ""social support from supervisors"" was associated with HAC among males (odds ratio [OR] = 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.23-0.8), whereas for female teachers with a high level of stress, ""variance in workload"" was associated with HAC (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.04-4.24), using an adjusted model. This study showed that moderate social support from supervisors was negatively related to HAC among male teachers, and high variance in workload was positively related to HAC among female teachers. Gender differences need to be considered when developing HAC prevention strategies for teachers."
https://openalex.org/W2892280052,"The risk of classical scrapie transmission in small ruminants is highest during the neonatal period with the placenta recognized as a significant source of infection. Milk has also been identified as a source of scrapie with sheep-to-sheep transmission occurring after neonatal consumption of as little as 1–2 liters of milk; concurrent mastitis due to small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) infection may be associated with increased scrapie transmission via milk in sheep. In contrast, goat-to-sheep transmission has been documented only after prolonged consumption of >30 liters of milk. The goal of the current study was to assess transmission of scrapie to goat kids and lambs following low volume, short duration consumption of milk from infected goats. Milk from two does (female goats) with pre-clinical scrapie was fed to four goat kids (≤4.5 L each) and four lambs (~3.7 L each) beginning ~24 hours after birth. Scrapie transmission was detected in three sheep as early as 18 months post inoculation; transmission was also detected in two goats but not until postmortem analyses at 33 months post inoculation. Each milk donor goat also had naturally-acquired infection with SRLV. Different degrees of lymphohistiocytic inflammation and PrPSc accumulation were observed in mammary gland tissues of the donors, which appeared to associate with transmission of scrapie via milk. Thus, similar to the risks of milk transmission of scrapie from sheep, even limited exposure to milk from goats can pose significant risk for scrapie transmission to both goat kids and lambs."

Since intestinal neoplasia has been associated with chronic inflammation, we investigated whether interfering with gut-homing affects intestinal tumorigenesis. Using chemically induced and spontaneous intestinal tumor models we showed that lack of β7 integrin significantly impairs tumor growth without affecting tumor frequencies, with a mild translatable effect on overall survival. This correlates with human data showing lower MAdCAM-1 expression and disease-free survival in colorectal cancer patients. Thus, paradoxically in contrast to extra-intestinal tumors, blocking migration of immune cells into the gut might have a positive therapeutic effect on intestinal neoplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2951406867,"Cognitive processes, such as the generation of language, can be mapped onto the brain using fMRI. These maps can in turn be used for decoding the respective processes from the brain activation patterns. Given individual variations in brain anatomy and organization, analyzes on the level of the single person are important to improve our understanding of how cognitive processes correspond to patterns of brain activity. They also allow to advance clinical applications of fMRI, because in the clinical setting making diagnoses for single cases is imperative. In the present study, we used mental imagery tasks to investigate language production, motor functions, visuo-spatial memory, face processing, and resting-state activity in a single person. Analysis methods were based on similarity metrics, including correlations between training and test data, as well as correlations with maps from the NeuroSynth meta-analysis. The goal was to make accurate predictions regarding the cognitive domain (e.g. language) and the specific content (e.g. animal names) of single 30-second blocks. Four teams used the dataset, each blinded regarding the true labels of the test data. Results showed that the similarity metrics allowed to reach the highest degrees of accuracy when predicting the cognitive domain of a block. Overall, 23 of the 25 test blocks could be correctly predicted by three of the four teams. Excluding the unspecific rest condition, up to 10 out of 20 blocks could be successfully decoded regarding their specific content. The study shows how the information contained in a single fMRI session and in each of its single blocks can allow to draw inferences about the cognitive processes an individual engaged in. Simple methods like correlations between blocks of fMRI data can serve as highly reliable approaches for cognitive decoding. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of clinical fMRI applications, with a focus on how decoding can support functional localization."

We included only patients who fulfilled one or more criteria of clinical case definitions for the age groups (0-3 months, 4 months-9 years, and ≥10 years of age). The data for this prospective epidemiological study were collected between 1st January 2013-31st December 2016 at the outpatients and inpatients health care settings in the South Bačka District of Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Serbia. We evaluated accuracy of the certain sign and symptom combinations of GPI case definitions based on their sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios.A total of 1043 participants were included, with 306 (29.3%) laboratory-confirmed pertussis cases. In patients aged 0-3 months, whoop and apnoea associated with laboratory confirmation of pertussis. In patients aged 4 months-9 years with a pertussis suspicion infection or with one of the other diagnoses, the highest accuracy was found for whoop combined with apnoea or post-tussive emesis. In patients aged 10 years and older, several different sign and symptom combinations were associated with an increased risk of pertussis among all enrolment diagnoses. There were fewer hospitalizations among the fully vaccinated children than in partly or unvaccinated children aged 4 months to 6 years (20.7% vs. 60.0%, p = 0.017).The numerous sign and symptom combinations in the observed case definitions were good predictors for laboratory-confirmed pertussis among all enrolment diagnoses, therefore suggesting the necessity for increased awareness of possibility for pertussis in patients with certain pertussis-like medical conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2890832019,"Because sulfur (S) depletion in soil results in seed yield losses and grain quality degradation, especially in high S-demanding crops such as oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), monitoring S fertilisation has become a central issue. Crop models can be efficient tools to conduct virtual experiments under different fertilisation management strategies. Using the process-based model SuMoToRI, we aimed to analyse the impact of different S fertilisation strategies coupled with the variablility observed in major plant characteristics in oilseed rape i.e. radiation use efficiency (RUE), carbon (C) allocation to the leaves (β) and specific leaf area (SLA) on plant performance-driven variables encompassing total biomass (TDW), S in the photosynthetic leaves (QSmobile.GL) and leaf area index (LAIGL). The contrasting S supply conditions differed in the amount of S (5 levels), and the timing of application (at bolting and/or at flowering, which included a fractioned condition). For this purpose, we performed a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and calculated two sensitivity indices i.e. the Partial Raw Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) and the Sobol index. The results showed that whatever the timing of S supply, TDW, LAIGL and QSmobile.GL increased as S input increased. For a given S supply, there was no difference in TDW, LAIGL and QSmobile.GL between a single and a fractioned supply. Moreover, delaying the supply until flowering reduced the TDW and LAIGL whereas QSmobile.GL increased. Results showed that RUE had the greatest impact on TDW under all levels of S supply and all application timings, followed by β and SLA. RUE mostly impacted on QSmobile.GL, depending on S supply conditions, whereas it was the parameter with the least impact on LAIGL. Ultimately, our results provide strong evidence of optimised S fertilisation timings and plant characteristics that will guide producers in their agricultural practices by using specific varieties under constrained S fertilisation strategies."

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of chronic oxygen therapy on the histological changes and survival rate in rats with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension was induced by monocrotaline injection. The rats were then randomly assigned to receive or not receive oxygen therapy (O2 group and non-O2 group, respectively). The rats in the O2 group were exposed to a high (90%) oxygen environment from day 17 following injection of monocrotaline, when hypoxemia was first observed. The pulmonary arteriole walls were significantly thicker in monocrotaline-injected rats than in saline-injected rats as vehicle on day 19 and were significantly thicker in the rats that received oxygen therapy than in the rats that did not. Right ventricular inflammations were significantly higher in monocrotaline-injected rats than in saline-injected rats on day 19 and were significantly higher in the rats that received oxygen therapy than in the rats that did not. By day 20 after injection of monocrotaline, the survival rate was significantly lower in the rats that received oxygen therapy than in those that did not. Superoxide dismutase activity in the lungs was higher in monocrotaline-injected rats than in saline-injected rats on day 19 after monocrotaline injection and was also higher in the saline-injected rats that received oxygen therapy than in the saline-injected rats that did not. No interaction was detected between monocrotaline injection and oxygen therapy. These results suggest that chronic oxygen therapy worsens the histological changes and survival rate in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. The fact that degradation of the histological changes and survival rate was accompanied by increase in superoxide dismutase activity suggests that antioxidant capacity may contribute to the degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2889874987,"Background Premature complexes are common electrocardiographic findings in daily clinical practice that require further evaluation. Investigation may sometimes be complex and expensive. The aim of our study was to analyze variables associated with premature beats identified in outpatients referred from a primary care facility. Materials and methods We performed a cross-sectional study of 407 outpatients (aged 55.8±11years; 56% women) who were followed by general practitioners and were referred for resting 12-lead electrocardiograms for a routine clinical follow-up. After signing informed consent, patients answered a questionnaire and underwent physical examinations, laboratory diagnostics, transthoracic echocardiograms and 24-hour Holter monitoring to evaluate for the presence of premature complexes. After the univariate analyses, logistic regression analyses were performed with adjustment for age, sex, and cardiovascular diseases. Results Premature complexes distribution revealed that they were frequent but with low density. Premature atrial complexes (≥ 4/hours) were associated with age (Odds Ratio (OD) = 1.030, Confidence Interval (CI) 95% = 1.002 ─ 1.059, p = 0.029), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels > 20mg/dL (OR = 4.489, 95%CI = 1.918 ─ 10.507, p = 0.0005), intraventricular blocks (OR = 4.184, 95%CI = 1.816 ─ 9.406, p = 0.0005) and left atrial diameter (OR = 1.065, 95%CI = 1.001 ─ 1.134, p = 0.046). Premature ventricular complexes (≥ 5/hour) were related to age (OR = 1.032, 95%CI = 1.010 ─ 1.054, p = 0.004), the use of calcium channel blockers (OR = 2.248, 95%CI = 1.019 ─ 4.954, p = 0.045), HDL-cholesterol levels (OR = 0.971, 95%CI = 0.951 ─ 0.992, p = 0.007), BNP levels > 20mg/dL (OR = 2.079, 95%CI = 0.991 ─ 0.998, p = 0.033), heart rate (OR = 1.019, 95%CI = 1.001 ─ 1.038, p = 0.041), left ventricular hypertrophy (OR = 2.292, 95%CI = 1.402 ─ 3.746, p = 0.001) and left ventricular ejection fraction (OR = 0.938, 95%CI = 0.900 ─ 0.978, p = 0.002). Conclusions Premature complexes had low density and were associated with BNP levels > 20mg/dL, lower levels of HDL-cholesterol, left atrial enlargement and ventricular hypertrophy. The identification of premature complexes on 24-hour Holter monitor recordings of outpatients in a primary public healthcare setting was associated with uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors that may be addressed with medical advice and therapy in a primary care setting."
https://openalex.org/W2890671582,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized with joint destructions; environmental and genetic factors were thought to be involved in the etiology of RA. The production of anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) is specifically associated with RA. DRB1 is associated with the susceptibility of RA, especially ACPA-positive RA [ACPA(+)RA]. However, a few studies reported on the independent associations of DPB1 alleles with RA susceptibility. Thus, we investigated the independent association of DPB1 alleles with RA in Japanese populations.Association analyses of DPB1 were conducted by logistic regression analysis in 1667 RA patients and 413 controls.In unconditioned analysis, DPB1*04:02 was nominally associated with the susceptibility of ACPA(+)RA (P = 0.0021, corrected P (Pc) = 0.0275, odds ratio [OR] 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-1.99). A significant association of DPB1*02:01 with the susceptibility of ACPA(+)RA was observed, when conditioned on DRB1 (Padjusted = 0.0003, Pcadjusted = 0.0040, ORadjusted 1.47, 95%CI 1.19-1.81). DPB1*05:01 was tended to be associated with the protection against ACPA(+)RA, when conditioned on DRB1 (Padjusted = 0.0091, Pcadjusted = 0.1184, ORadjusted 0.78, 95%CI 0.65-0.94). When conditioned on DRB1, the association of DPB1*04:02 with ACPA(+)RA was disappeared. No association of DPB1 alleles with ACPA-negative RA was detected.The independent association of DPB1*02:01 with Japanese ACPA(+)RA was identified."
https://openalex.org/W2891276434,"In vivo cell tracking of therapeutic, tumor, and endothelial cells is an emerging field and a promising technique for imaging cardiovascular disease and cancer development. Site-specific labeling of endothelial cells with the MRI contrast agent superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) in the absence of toxic agents is challenging. Therefore, the aim of this in vitro study was to find optimal parameters for efficient and safe SPIO-labeling of endothelial cells using ultrasound-activated CD31-targeted microbubbles for future MRI tracking. Ultrasound at a frequency of 1 MHz (10,000 cycles, repetition rate of 20 Hz) was used for varying applied peak negative pressures (10-160 kPa, i.e. low mechanical index (MI) of 0.01-0.16), treatment durations (0-30 s), time of SPIO addition (-5 min- 15 min with respect to the start of the ultrasound), and incubation time after SPIO addition (5 min- 3 h). Iron specific Prussian Blue staining in combination with calcein-AM based cell viability assays were applied to define the most efficient and safe conditions for SPIO-labeling. Optimal SPIO labeling was observed when the ultrasound parameters were 40 kPa peak negative pressure (MI 0.04), applied for 30 s just before SPIO addition (0 min). Compared to the control, this resulted in an approximate 12 times increase of SPIO uptake in endothelial cells in vitro with 85% cell viability. Therefore, ultrasound-activated targeted ultrasound contrast agents show great potential for effective and safe labeling of endothelial cells with SPIO."
https://openalex.org/W2892218309,"Evolutionary history can explain species resemblance to a large extent. Thus, if closely related species share combinations of traits that modulate their response to environmental changes, then phylogeny could predict species sensitivity to novel stressors such as increased levels of deforestation. To test this hypothesis, we used 66,949 plots (25-m-radius) of the Spanish National Forest Inventory and modelled the relationships between local (plot-level) stem density of 61 Holarctic tree species and forest canopy cover measured at local and landscape scales (concentric circles centred on the plots with radiuses of 1.6, 3.2 and 6.4 km, respectively). Then, we used the output model equations to estimate the probability of occurrence of the species as a function of forest canopy cover (i.e. response to forest loss), and quantified the phylogenetic signal in their responses using a molecular phylogeny. Most species showed a lower probability of occurrence when forest canopy cover in the plots (local scale) was low. However, the probability of occurrence of many species increased when forest canopy cover decreased across landscape scales. We detected a strong phylogenetic signal in species response to forest loss at local and small landscape (1.6 km) scales. However, phylogenetic signal was weak and non-significant at intermediate (3.2 km) and large (6.4 km) landscape scales. Our results suggest that phylogenetic information could be used to prioritize forested areas for conservation, since evolutionary history may largely determine species response to forest loss. As such, phylogenetically diverse forests might ensure contrasted responses to deforestation, and thus less abrupt reductions in the abundances of the constituent species."
https://openalex.org/W2891850576,"Neuroglobin (Ngb) is highly expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and can regulate Per1 gene expression. It is still not known whether Ngb also influences Cryptochrome (Cry). Cry is implicated in hypertension and primary aldosteronism (PA) in mice. There is a strong correlation between Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and PA. We propose to prove that Ngb and Cry play a role in OSA with PA.Subjects were recruited consecutively from residents of Jakarta, Indonesia; subjects aged 30-65 years with moderate to severe OSA and hypertension were included in the study. OSA was diagnosed using an unattended type 2 portable monitor (Alice Pdx), hypertension was diagnosed when morning blood pressure exceeded 140/90 mmHg or when taking anti-hypertensive drugs. Serum concentration of aldosterone, renin, Cry1, Cry2 and Ngb protein were determined using ELISA method. Primary aldosteronism (PA) was defined as ARR ≥20.Forty subjects were recruited, 26 male and 14 female, median age 52.5 years, BMI 27.46 kg/m2, and AHI 34.8 times/hour. We found 16 subjects with PA and 24 non PA. Cry1 and Cry2 did not correlate with ARR in PA and non PA groups. Ngb correlated positively with Cry1 (Spearman's rho = 0.455, p = 0.038) but not Cry2 in PA patients. Cry1 concentration decreased in severe hypoxia.Ngb correlates with Cry1 in OSA with PA. There is no correlation between Cry1 or Cry2 with PA."
https://openalex.org/W2890309473,"The molecular pathways involved in the transition from uterine quiescence to overt labour are mapped and form the currently established pharmacological targets for both the induction and inhibition of human labour. However, both spontaneous premature labour and functional dystocia occur and are difficult to treat adequately. The identification of upstream regulators involved in the onset and orchestration of labour pathways is essential to develop additional therapies that will contribute to the regulation of the timing of birth.To define uterine biological processes and their upstream activators involved in the transition from uterine quiescence to overt labour.The uterus of non-pregnant and pregnant FVB M. musculus is collected at embryonic days (E) 6.5, 8.5, 10.5, 12.5, 15.5 and 17.5 and the uterine transcriptome is determined using the Illumina mouse Ref8v2 micro-array platform. K-means clustering and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis are applied to further dissect the transcriptome data.From E6.5 to E17.5, 5405 genes are significantly differentially expressed and they segregate into 7 unique clusters. Five of the 7 clusters are enriched for genes involved in specific biological processes that include regulation of gene-expression, T-cell receptor activation, Toll-like receptor signalling and steroid metabolism. The identification of upstream activators for differentially expressed genes between consecutive time points highlights the E10.5 to E12.5 window during which the role from progesterone switches from an activated state to the inhibited state reflecting the process of functional progesterone withdrawal essential for the transgression from myometrial quiescence to synchronized contractions. For this time window in which 189 genes are differentially expressed we define 22 putative upstream activators of which NUPR1 and TBX2 are the most significant with respectively an activated and an inhibited status.Gene expression profiling of mice uterus from E6.5 to E17.5 results in 7 unique gene expression clusters from early to late pregnancy that define the landscape of molecular events in ongoing pregnancy. In the current dataset progesterone is predicted as an activated upstream regulator and maintainer of myometrial quiescence and is active till E10.5. Progesterone is predicted as an inhibited upstream regulator at E12.5. We identify 22 upstream regulators in the E10.5 to E12.5 time window where the switch to progesterone withdrawal occurs. They are putative relevant upstream activators of labour."
