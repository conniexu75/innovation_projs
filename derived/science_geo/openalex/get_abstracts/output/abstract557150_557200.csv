https://openalex.org/W2318767358,"Inflammation has an important role in the development of liver fibrosis in general and the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in particular. It is known that HSCs are themselves able to produce cytokines and chemokines, and that this production may be a key event in the initiation of fibrogenesis. However, the direct involvement of cytokines and chemokines in HSC (self-)activation remains uncertain. In this study, the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1α and β, TNF-α, and IL-8 on the activation state of HSCs were examined, in comparison to the pro-fibrogenic mediator TGF-β1. LX-2 cells were stimulated for 24 or 48 hours with recombinant human form of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1α and β, TNF-α, and IL-8, and also the pro-fibrogenic mediator TGF-β1. Two drugs were also evaluated, the anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody infliximab and the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, regarding their inhibitory effects. In LX-2 human HSC, treatment with TGF-β1 are associated with downregulation of the metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-3, with upregulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, collagen type I α1, collagen type IV α1, α-SMA, endothelin-1 and PDGF-BB. Cytokines and chemokines expression were found to be downregulated, excepting IL-6. In contrast, we observed that LX-2 exposure to IL-1, TNF-α and IL-8 can reverse the phenotype of pro-fibrogenic activated cells. Indeed, MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-9 were found elevated, associated with downregulation of α-SMA and/or PDGF-BB, and a greater expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1 and CCL2. Lastly, we found that infliximab and anakinra successfully inhibits effects of TNF-α and IL-1 respectively in LX-2 cells. Infliximab and anakinra may be of value in preclinical trials in chronic liver disease. Overall, our results suggest that (i) pro-inflammatory mediators exert complex effects in HSCs via an MMP/TIMP imbalance, and (ii) targeting IL-1 signaling may be a potentially valuable therapeutic strategy in chronic liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2316348002,"Oxidative stress arises from an imbalance in the production and scavenging rates of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is a key factor in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease and aging. The presence of parallel pathways and multiple intracellular compartments, each having its own ROS sources and antioxidant enzymes, complicates the determination of the most important regulatory nodes of the redox network. Here we quantified ROS dynamics within specific intracellular compartments in the cytosol and mitochondria and determined which scavenging enzymes exert the most control over antioxidant fluxes in H9c2 cardiac myoblasts. We used novel targeted viral gene transfer vectors expressing redox-sensitive GFP fused to sensor domains to measure H2O2 or oxidized glutathione. Using genetic manipulation in heart-derived H9c2 cells, we explored the contribution of specific antioxidant enzymes to ROS scavenging and glutathione redox potential within each intracellular compartment. Our findings reveal that antioxidant flux is strongly dependent on mitochondrial substrate catabolism, with availability of NADPH as a major rate-controlling step. Moreover, ROS scavenging by mitochondria significantly contributes to cytoplasmic ROS handling. The findings provide fundamental information about the control of ROS scavenging by the redox network and suggest novel interventions for circumventing oxidative stress in cardiac cells."
https://openalex.org/W2321831128,"Emerging evidence suggests that DNAM-1 (CD226) play an important role in the recognition of tumor cells and their lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and NK cells. Although the DNAM-1 ligand CD155 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, many human tumors significantly upregulate the expression of CD155; DNAM-1 on CTL and NK cells may be involved in tumor immunity. However, unlike those in mice, human tissues also express soluble isoforms of CD155 (sCD155) that lack the transmembrane region. Here, we show that sCD155 levels were significantly higher in the sera of 262 patients with lung, gastrointestinal, breast, and gynecologic cancers than in sera from healthy donors. In addition, the sCD155 levels were significantly higher in patients with early stage (stages 1 and 2) gastric cancer than in healthy donors, and were significantly higher in patients with advanced stage (stages 3 and 4) disease than in patients in those with early stage disease and healthy donors. Moreover, the sCD155 levels were significantly decreased after surgical resection of cancers. Thus, sCD155 level in serum may be potentially useful as a biomarker for cancer development and progression."

The PA group was subdivided into two subgroups, which comprised patients with temporal visual field (VF) defects (perimetric PA group, 34 eyes) and without VF defect (preperimetric PA group, 12 eyes). The mGCIPL thickness and circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (cpRNFL) thickness were measured using Cirrus HD-OCT. We calculated the number of patients who had an abnormal GCA sector map, defined as at least one yellow or red sector.Eyes in the perimetric PA group had significantly decreased mGCIPL thickness in all sectors. Eyes in the preperimetric PA group had significantly thinner mGCIPL in the superior, superonasal, inferonasal, and inferior sectors than eyes in control group, but no changes in cpRNFL parameters were observed. The mGCIPL thickness in inferonasal area showed the greatest AUC value (0.965), followed by the superonasal area (0.958) for discriminating preperimetric PA group from the control group. A higher reduction rate of mGCIPL thickness was noted in the nasal sector compared to other sectors, which was irrespective of temporal visual field defects. The mGCIPL thickness maps showed superonasal (P = 0.003) and inferonasal thinning in the PA group (P = 0.003), while inferotemporal thinning was revealed in the NTG group (P = 0.001).Macular GCIPL thickness parameters obtained with the Cirrus HD-OCT were useful in early detection of chiasmal compression and differentiating from NTG by characteristic nasal mGCIPL thinning."
https://openalex.org/W2325966782,"Tropical rainforests support the greatest diversity of small mammals in the world, yet we have little understanding about the mechanisms that promote the coexistence of species. Diet partitioning can favor coexistence by lessening competition, and interspecific differences in body size and habitat use are usually proposed to be associated with trophic divergence. However, the use of classic dietary methods (e.g. stomach contents) is challenging in small mammals, particularly in community-level studies, thus we used stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) to infer about trophic niche. We investigated i) how trophic niche is partitioned among rodent and marsupial species in three Atlantic forest sites and ii) if interspecific body size and locomotor habit inequalities can constitute mechanisms underlying the isotopic niche partitioning. We found that rodents occupied a broad isotopic niche space with species distributed in different trophic levels and relying on diverse basal carbon sources (C3 and C4 plants). Surprisingly, on the other hand, marsupials showed a narrow isotopic niche, both in δ13C and δ15N dimensions, which is partially overlapped with rodents, contradicting their description as omnivores and generalists proposed classic dietary studies. Although body mass differences did not explained the divergence in isotopic values among species, groups of species with different locomotor habit presented clear differences in the position of the isotopic niche space, indicating that the use of different forest strata can favor trophic niche partitioning in small mammals communities. We suggest that anthropogenic impacts, such as habitat modification (logging, harvesting), can simplify the vertical structure of ecosystems and collapse the diversity of basal resources, which might affect negatively small mammals communities in Atlantic forests."
https://openalex.org/W2324221791,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease that has a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Chemokine receptor interactions are important modulators of breast cancer metastasis; however, it is now recognized that quantitative surface expression of one important chemokine receptor, CXCR4, may not directly correlate with metastasis and that its functional activity in breast cancer may better inform tumor pathogenicity. G protein coupled receptor kinase 3 (GRK3) is a negative regulator of CXCR4 activity, and we show that GRK expression correlates with tumorigenicity, molecular subtype, and metastatic potential in human tumor microarray analysis. Using established human breast cancer cell lines and an immunocompetent in vivo mouse model, we further demonstrate that alterations in GRK3 expression levels in tumor cells directly affect migration and invasion in vitro and the establishment of distant metastasis in vivo. The effects of GRK3 modulation appear to be specific to chemokine-mediated migration behaviors without influencing tumor cell proliferation or survival. These data demonstrate that GRK3 dysregulation may play an important part in TNBC metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2319186329,"Introduction Smartphone applications (apps) facilitate the collection of data on multiple aspects of behavior that are useful for characterizing baseline patterns and for monitoring progress in interventions aimed at promoting healthier lifestyles. Individual-based models can be used to examine whether behavior, such as diet, corresponds to certain typological patterns. The objectives of this paper are to demonstrate individual-based modeling methods relevant to a person’s eating behavior, and the value of such approach compared to typical regression models. Method Using a mobile app, 2 weeks of physical activity and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data, and 6 days of diet data were collected from 12 university students recruited from a university in Kunming, a rapidly developing city in southwest China. Phone GPS data were collected for the entire 2-week period, from which exposure to various food environments along each subject’s activity space was determined. Physical activity was measured using phone accelerometry. Mobile phone EMA was used to assess self-reported emotion/feelings. The portion size of meals and food groups was determined from voice-annotated videos of meals. Individual-based regression models were used to characterize subjects as following one of 4 diet typologies: those with a routine portion sizes determined by time of day, those with portion sizes that balance physical activity (energy balance), those with portion sizes influenced by emotion, and those with portion sizes associated with food environments. Results Ample compliance with the phone-based behavioral assessment was observed for all participants. Across all individuals, 868 consumed food items were recorded, with fruits, grains and dairy foods dominating the portion sizes. On average, 218 hours of accelerometry and 35 EMA responses were recorded for each participant. For some subjects, the routine model was able to explain up to 47% of the variation in portion sizes, and the energy balance model was able to explain over 88% of the variation in portion sizes. Across all our subjects, the food environment was an important predictor of eating patterns. Generally, grouping all subjects into a pooled model performed worse than modeling each individual separately. Conclusion A typological modeling approach was useful in understanding individual dietary behaviors in our cohort. This approach may be applicable to the study of other human behaviors, particularly those that collect repeated measures on individuals, and those involving smartphone-based behavioral measurement."
https://openalex.org/W2319881636,"Electron-transferring flavoprotein (Etf) and butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Bcd) from Acidaminococcus fermentans catalyze the endergonic reduction of ferredoxin by NADH, which is also driven by the concomitant reduction of crotonyl-CoA by NADH, a process called electron bifurcation. Here we show that recombinant flavodoxin from A. fermentans produced in Escherichia coli can replace ferredoxin with almost equal efficiency. After complete reduction of the yellow quinone to the blue semiquinone, a second 1.4 times faster electron transfer affords the colorless hydroquinone. Mediated by a hydrogenase, protons reoxidize the fully reduced flavodoxin or ferredoxin to the semi-reduced species. In this hydrogen-generating system, both electron carriers act catalytically with apparent Km = 0.26 μm ferredoxin or 0.42 μm flavodoxin. Membrane preparations of A. fermentans contain a highly active ferredoxin/flavodoxin-NAD+ reductase (Rnf) that catalyzes the irreversible reduction of flavodoxin by NADH to the blue semiquinone. Using flavodoxin hydroquinone or reduced ferredoxin obtained by electron bifurcation, Rnf can be measured in the forward direction, whereby one NADH is recycled, resulting in the simple equation: crotonyl-CoA + NADH + H+ = butyryl-CoA + NAD+ with Km = 1.4 μm ferredoxin or 2.0 μm flavodoxin. This reaction requires Na+ (Km = 0.12 mm) or Li+ (Km = 0.25 mm) for activity, indicating that Rnf acts as a Na+ pump. The redox potential of the quinone/semiquinone couple of flavodoxin (Fld) is much higher than that of the semiquinone/hydroquinone couple. With free riboflavin, the opposite is the case. Based on this behavior, we refine our previous mechanism of electron bifurcation.

https://openalex.org/W2323920230,"Telomere length has generated substantial interest as a potential predictor of aging-related diseases and mortality. Some studies have reported significant associations, but few have tested its ability to discriminate between decedents and survivors compared with a broad range of well-established predictors that include both biomarkers and commonly collected self-reported data. Our aim here was to quantify the prognostic value of leukocyte telomere length relative to age, sex, and 19 other variables for predicting five-year mortality among older persons in three countries. We used data from nationally representative surveys in Costa Rica (N = 923, aged 61+), Taiwan (N = 976, aged 54+), and the U.S. (N = 2672, aged 60+). Our study used a prospective cohort design with all-cause mortality during five years post-exam as the outcome. We fit Cox hazards models separately by country, and assessed the discriminatory ability of each predictor. Age was, by far, the single best predictor of all-cause mortality, whereas leukocyte telomere length was only somewhat better than random chance in terms of discriminating between decedents and survivors. After adjustment for age and sex, telomere length ranked between 15th and 17th (out of 20), and its incremental contribution was small; nine self-reported variables (e.g., mobility, global self-assessed health status, limitations with activities of daily living, smoking status), a cognitive assessment, and three biological markers (C-reactive protein, serum creatinine, and glycosylated hemoglobin) were more powerful predictors of mortality in all three countries. Results were similar for cause-specific models (i.e., mortality from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all other causes combined). Leukocyte telomere length had a statistically discernible, but weak, association with mortality, but it did not predict survival as well as age or many other self-reported variables. Although telomere length may eventually help scientists understand aging, more powerful and more easily obtained tools are available for predicting survival."
https://openalex.org/W2335583754,"Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) in the brains of AD patients is thought to be closely related to neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Therefore, protecting mitochondria from Aβ-induced neurotoxicity is an effective strategy for AD therapeutics. In a previous study, we found that geniposide, a pharmacologically active compound purified from gardenia fruit, has protective effects on oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD transgenic mouse models. However, whether geniposide has a protective effect on Aβ-induced neuronal dysfunction remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that geniposide protects cultured primary cortical neurons from Aβ-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction by recovering ATP generation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) and caspase 3/9 activity; by reducing ROS production and cytochrome c leakage; as well as by inhibiting apoptosis. These findings suggest that geniposide may attenuate Aβ-induced neuronal injury by inhibiting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress."

The Hippo signaling pathway has been under intense scrutiny because of its conserved ability to regulate organ size and cell proliferation (1Piccolo S. Dupont S. Cordenonsi M. The biology of YAP/TAZ: Hippo signaling and beyond.Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The canonical Hippo pathway revolves around the kinase cascade of Mst1/2, Lats1/2, and their coactivators Sav1 and Mob, which leads to phosphorylation of transcriptional co-activator with a PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) 3The abbreviations used are: TAZtranscriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motifYAPYes-associated proteinTEADTEA domain transcription factorGPCRG protein-coupled receptorLPAlysophosphatidic acidROSreactive oxygen speciesNOXNAD(P)H oxidaseqPCRquantitative PCRCTGFconnective tissue growth factorDHEdihydroethidineI/Rischemia/reperfusionIPimmunoprecipitation. and Yes Associated protein (YAP). Both TAZ and YAP are transcriptional co-activators and downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway. The stability of these proteins depends on Lats1/2 phosphorylation of TAZ at Ser-89 (Ser-127 in YAP), leading to 14-3-3 binding and cytoplasmic retention. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Ser-314 of TAZ and Ser-381 of YAP primes them for subsequent casein kinase 1-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (2Zhang H. Liu C.Y. Zha Z.Y. Zhao B.

On the protein level, TAZ and YAP display ∼50% sequence similarity, including the conserved phosphorylation residues. They have many common but also few distinct protein-protein interaction partners that are essential for their stability and function (11Kohli P. Bartram M.P. Habbig S. Pahmeyer C. Lamkemeyer T.

The human proteome contains ∼200,000 cysteine residues, making cysteine one of the least commonly used amino acids (12Jones D.P. Radical-free biology of oxidative stress.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C849-C868Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). This implies the evolutionary importance of cysteine content, which correlates with the degree of biological complexity of an organism (13Miseta A. Csutora P. Relationship between the occurrence of cysteine in proteins and the complexity of organisms.Mol. Biol. Evolution. 2000; 17: 1232-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Homeostasis between cellular oxidation and reduction reactions plays a critical role in signal transduction. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are in general regarded as cytotoxic, mutagenic, and inducers of oxidative stress. However, several studies implicate ROS in the stimulation or inhibition of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell senescence (14Bae Y.S. Oh H. Rhee S.G. Yoo Y.D. Regulation of reactive oxygen species generation in cell signaling.Mol. Cells. 2011; 32: 491-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Posttranslational modifications of cysteines can directly influence these processes. S-glutathionylation is a well characterized protein modification. An oxidized glutathione (GSSG) forms a disulfide linkage with the reactive thiol group of cysteine, resulting in a protein-glutathione complex. Mild oxidative stress upon elevated superoxide (O2·¯) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can induce S-glutathionylation at cysteine residues, which can lead to alteration of protein function (15Hawkins B.J.

In this study, we demonstrate that TAZ is S-glutathionylated at residues Cys-261, Cys-315, and Cys-358 in vitro. Circumstantial S-glutathionylation of TAZ may lead to activation of its transcriptional activity and could function as a redox sensor of the Hippo pathway.

AB3792). One microgram of total RNA from HEK 293T cells was used to generate cDNA templates for reverse transcriptase PCR. The first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using a hexamer (Applied Biosystems) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). The first-strand cDNA products were further diluted 1:1 and used as qPCR templates. The SYBR Green-based qPCR analysis was carried out in a real-time PCR system (7900HT, Applied Biosystems). Duplicate reactions were carried out for each sample. All samples were normalized by the expression level of the housekeeping gene β-actin. The primer sequences used in the qPCR assays were as follows: hCYR61, 5′-AGCCTCGCATCCTATACAACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCTTTCACAAGGCGGCACTC-3′ (reverse); β-actin, 5′-GGACTTCGAGCAAGAGATGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCACTGTGTTGGCG TACAG3-′ (reverse); mTAZ, 5′-CCGGGTGGGAGATGACCTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGTTCACATGATTCAGAGGCT-3′ (reverse); and mYAP, 5′-GTCCTCCTTTGAGATCCCTGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTTGTTGTCTGATCGTTGTGAT-3′ (reverse). TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems) were used to evaluate CTGF (Hs00170014_m1) and β-actin (4326315E) levels. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate method, and the total amount of DNA was always adjusted with empty pcDNA6 (Invitrogen). For TAZ and NOX4 expression studies, plasmids were co-transfected in a ratio of 5:1. The following day, cells were harvested with ice-cold PBS. The harvested cells were lysed in a 1% Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mMNaCl, 50 mMNaF, 15 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and complete protease inhibitors (PIM complete, Roche)) for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with the anti-FLAG (M2) covalently coupled to agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) or with 1 μg of the appropriate first antibody and 30 μl protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Before the addition of antibodies, a small aliquot of each supernatant was preserved and diluted with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for later Western blot analysis (lysate). The beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted on to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Visualization was performed by infra-red detection using donkey anti mouse IRDye 680 or donkey anti rabbit IRDye 800 in the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Quantification was performed with the LI-COR Image StudioTM analysis software provided in a linear dynamic range. The luciferase reporter plasmid (pGBD-Hyg-Luc) was transfected together with an activator plasmid (pGal4-TEAD), pGL4.74 (Promega), for normalization and the indicated expression plasmids (TAZ, YAP, NOX4, and control empty pcDNA6) into HEK 293T cells in a 96-well format using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as a transfection reagent. The total amount of DNA was always adjusted with empty pcDNA6. Renilla luciferase and firefly luciferase activities were measured by using a reporter assay system (Dual-Luciferase, Promega) in a luminometer (Mithras LB 940, Berthold) at 6 or 24 h after treatment. Transfections and measurements were performed in triplicates for each single experiment, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. The remaining lysates were pooled in 2× Laemmli, and TAZ expression was determined by immunoblotting. The error bars shown in the figures represent standard error. p values were calculated using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. 2 × 104 HEK 293T cells were seeded in optical-bottomed 96-well plates (Nunc) in complete DMEM. 16 h later, cells were challenged with H2O2 or LPA for 1 h. Cells were loaded either with 10 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 520 nm; Sigma-Aldrich) or 10 μm DHE (excitation, 510 nm; emission, 595 nm; Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were gently rinsed in Hanks’ balanced salt solution once, and fluorescence intensity was immediately quantified in a multimode plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). We used a rodent warm ischemia/reperfusion model. The surgical procedure was approved by the Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt, und Verbraucherschutz NRW (LANUV 84–02.04.2013.A158). Male 10- to 12-week-old C57BL/6J mice were anesthetized with a Ketavet/xylazine injection intraperitoneally. The following steps were conducted on a heat pad to preserve the physiological body temperature of the experimental animals. After cessation of reflexes, a median laparotomy was carried out. The right kidney pedicle was mobilized and clamped for 30 min with an atraumatic microvascular clamp. Successful ischemia was confirmed by discoloration of the kidney. During ischemia, the abdomen was covered with gauze soaked with normal saline. At the end of ischemia, the clamp was released, and the kidney was controlled for visual signs of reperfusion. 5 μm Hoechst 33342 and dihydroethidium (DHE) was injected via retro-orbital injection. Five minutes after reperfusion, two-photon imaging of the intact kidney was performed (Leica TCS SP8 MP-OPO) with a ×20 water immersion objective as described previously (18Hall A.M. Crawford C. Unwin R.J. Duchen M.R. Peppiatt-Wildman C.M. Multiphoton imaging of the functioning kidney.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2011; 22: 1297-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the right ischemic and left unharmed kidney was harvested in PBS for protein extraction. 500 μg of total protein extract was used for immunoprecipitation experiments. Tissue sections were deparaffinized by two changes of xylene for 5 min each. Slides were then rehydrated in two changes of 100% ethanol for 3 min, followed by 95% and 70% ethanol for 1 min, and rinsed in TBS. Sections were boiled in sodium citrate buffer (10 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.0)) for 20 min. Slides were allowed to cool, and endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched using 3% H2O2 in methanol. Sections were pretreated with unconjugated avidin followed by biotin treatment (Vector Laboratories, SP2001). Slides were then incubated with primary anti-YAP (1:500) or anti-TAZ (V386) (1:500) at 4 °C overnight. Slides were washed three times with TBS, followed by incubation with biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit IgG diluted secondary antibody (1:500) for 1 h. After final washing, slides were incubated with ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min. Finally, DAB reagent (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) was added to the sections for 5 min and counterstained with hematoxylin. Sections were dehydrated and mounted with Histomount. The slides were then scanned with an automated slide scanner (Leica), and images were quantified using the positive pixel count feature in Imagescope (Leica). NIH-3T3 TAZ or YAP GFP flp-in cells were grown on μ-Dish 35-mm, high glass bottom dishes (Ibidi). Cells were then exposed to 250 μm H2O2 or vehicle control (PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed once in complete medium, and fluorescent images were captured at 488-nm excitation using the Zeiss LSM710 META confocal imaging system with a ×40/1.3 numerical aperture oil objective at room temperature. Images were analyzed and quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). All statistical comparisons between groups were analyzed using two-tailed Student’s t test. Differences in means among multiple groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post test unless otherwise indicated. p < 0.05 was considered significant in all analyses. The data were computed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0. A previous study observed increased levels of TAZ but not YAP upon stimulation with the GPCR agonist LPA, suggesting that TAZ might be differently regulated than YAP (5Yu F.X. Zhao B. Panupinthu N. Jewell J.L. Lian I. Wang L.H. Zhao J. Yuan H. Tumaneng K. Li H. Fu X.D. Mills G.B. Guan K.L. Regulation of the Hippo-YAP pathway by G-protein-coupled receptor signaling.Cell. 2012; 150: 780-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). It has been well characterized that LPA induces ROS via the phospholipase C/PKC/NOX pathway (19Saunders J.A. Rogers L.C. Klomsiri C. Poole L.B. Daniel L.W. Reactive oxygen species mediate lysophosphatidic acid induced signaling in ovarian cancer cells.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 49: 2058-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Lin C.C.

Commun. 2013; 440: 564-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hence, we hypothesized that ROS could specifically augment total TAZ levels. To assess whether ROS modulates TAZ/YAP expression, we first investigated the role of exogenous H2O2 in HEK 293 cells transiently expressing either wild-type YAP or TAZ. HEK 293T cells exposed to increasing concentrations of H2O2 (0, 50 100, or 200 μm) for 1 h showed a dose-dependent increase in intracellular ROS levels, as determined by dichlorodihydrofluorescein staining in live cells, which was inhibited by preincubating cells with antioxidant-reduced GSH (Fig. 1A). In this model, we observed an increase in total TAZ (Fig. 1B), whereas YAP was significantly degraded (Fig. 1C). To validate whether H2O2 differentially alters TAZ and YAP stability, we pretreated cells expressing TAZ and YAP with cycloheximide, followed by exposure H2O2 for 1 h. We observed that total YAP levels were decreased, whereas TAZ levels remained stable under these conditions (Fig. 1D). YAP and TAZ are essential co-activators of the TEAD family of transcription factors. To determine whether H2O2 influences the trans-activation of YAP/TAZ, we performed a TEAD reporter gene assay as described previously (21Habbig S. Bartram M.P. Müller R.U. Schwarz R. Andriopoulos N. Chen S. Sägmüller J.G. Hoehne M. Burst V. Liebau M.C. Reinhardt H.C. Benzing T. Schermer B. NPHP4, a cilia-associated protein, negatively regulates the Hippo pathway.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 193: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TAZ/TEAD4 trans-activation principally remained unaltered following 6-h incubation, with a slight but significant increase at 50 μm H2O2 (Fig. 1E), whereas there was a significant decrease of YAP/TEAD4 trans-activation when exposed to H2O2 (Fig. 1F). NAD(P)H oxidase 4 (NOX4) serves as the endogenous source of H2O2 in cellular systems (22Jiang F. Liu G.S. Dusting G.J. Chan E.C. NADPH oxidase-dependent redox signaling in TGF-β-mediated fibrotic responses.Redox Biol. 2014; 2: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in several murine renal disease models (23Babelova A. Avaniadi D. Jung O. Fork C. Beckmann J. Kosowski J. Weissmann N. Anilkumar N. Shah A.M. Schaefer L. Schroder K. Brandes R.P. Role of Nox4 in murine models of kidney disease.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2012; 53: 842-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Hence, we investigated whether NOX4-derived H2O2 could alter TAZ/YAP/TEAD activity in a similar manner. NOX4 co-expression significantly up-regulates TAZ/TEAD activity, whereas YAP/TEAD activity was diminished, consistent with our findings using exogenous H2O2 (Fig. 1G). In addition, increasing amounts of exogenously expressed NOX4 decreased YAP expression without affecting TAZ (Fig. 1H), which is again congruent with H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1, B and C). Similar results were obtained using NOX1, NOX3, and p22-phox overexpression constructs (data not shown). H2O2 did not significantly alter the TAZ/TEAD interaction, but the YAP/TEAD4 interaction was considerably diminished (Fig. 1, I and J). To substantiate the role of H2O2-induced TAZ/YAP target gene expression, we quantified the mRNA expression of CTGF, which is a bona fide target gene for both TAZ and YAP (2Zhang H. Liu C.Y. Zha Z.Y. Zhao B. Yao J. Zhao S. Xiong Y. Lei Q.Y. Guan K.L. TEAD transcription factors mediate the function of TAZ in cell growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13355-13362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). H2O2 exposure increased CTGF expression in a dose-dependent manner in cells expressing TAZ/TEAD4 constructs, which was attenuated by pretreating cells with antioxidant-reduced GSH (Fig. 1K). However, YAP failed to induce CTGF expression above the basal levels despite H2O2 exposure (Fig. 1L). Next we generated stable cell lines expressing wild-type GFP-tagged TAZ and YAP at low expression levels in NIH-3T3 Flp-in cells as described previously (11Kohli P. Bartram M.P. Habbig S. Pahmeyer C. Lamkemeyer T. Benzing T. Schermer B. Rinschen M.M. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of the YAP/TAZ interactome.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2014; 306: C805-C818Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 Flp-in cells have the advantage of single-copy genomic integration. TAZ GFP wild-type showed increased accumulation and nuclear localization upon 1-h H2O2 exposure compared with YAP GFP wild-type (Fig. 1M), confirming that ROS could differentially regulate TAZ and YAP. TAZ and YAP are transcriptional co-activators downstream of the Hippo pathway and have been well characterized in several pathophysiological models (24Johnson R. Halder G. The two faces of Hippo: targeting the Hippo pathway for regenerative medicine and cancer treatment.Nat. Rev. Drug Disc. 2014; 13: 63-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Comparing the amino acid sequences of mouse proteins reveals that TAZ has three evolutionarily conserved cysteine residues (Cys-261, Cys-315, and Cys-358), whereas YAP has none. Of the three cysteine residues in TAZ, Cys-315 is evolutionarily conserved from lower organisms to higher mammals (Fig. 2A). We speculated that the cysteine residues in TAZ could undergo H2O2 induced S-glutathionylation and that this could be responsible for the H2O2 effect on TAZ expression and activation. Oxidative stress can directly modify cysteine residues, leading to formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds. Exposing recombinant His TAZ protein with 100 μm H2O2 for 30 min did not alter protein mobility under non-reducing conditions, suggesting that oxidant stress did not directly modify TAZ (Fig. 2B). HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with wild-type TAZ and YAP. 100 μm H2O2 induced S-glutathionylation in TAZ but not YAP, as detected in precipitates with an antibody directed against GSH. TAZ S-glutathionylation was partially reversed by addition of 1 mm DTT to cells 30 min after H2O2 exposure (Fig. 2C). H2O2 induced TAZ S-glutathionylation in a dose-dependent manner, which was inhibited by pretreating cells with antioxidants such as reduced GSH or N-acetylcysteine. Interestingly, there was no detectable phosphorylated TAZ (Ser-89) upon S-glutathionylation (Fig. 2D). Protein S-glutathionylation can occur at single or multiple cysteine residues in a context-dependent manner (25Grek C.L. Zhang J. Manevich Y. Townsend D.M. Tew K.D. Causes and consequences of cysteine S-glutathionylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Analysis of different Cys-Ala mutants revealed that only the triple mutant lacking all three cysteine residues but not the single or double mutants was negative for S-glutathionylation. These observations suggest that TAZ can undergo S-glutathionylation at all three residues, with higher specificity toward the evolutionarily conserved residue Cys-315 (Fig. 2, E–I). Because all three cysteines undergo S-glutathionylation, we then investigated the sensitivity of the TAZ cysteine triple mutant toward H2O2-mediated activation using a TEAD reporter assay. Strikingly, the TAZ triple mutant did not show any significant activation following 6 h exposure of H2O2 compared with the wild type (Fig. 3A). We then characterized the TAZ cysteine mutants in TAZ/TEAD reporter assays. The TAZ C315A mutant evoked a significantly elevated transactivation compared with the wild type, whereas both the C261A and C358A mutants did not show any significant change (Fig. 3B). Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed elevated expression of the TAZ target genes CTGF and CYR61 in HEK 293 cells expressing the TAZ C315A mutant, supporting the idea t"

The adjoining area also supports one of the highest human densities and experiences severe human-tiger conflicts. We used GPS-Satellite and VHF radio-collars on 6 (3 males and 3 female) tigers to study their ranging patterns and habitat preference. The average home range (95% Fixed Kernel) for resident females was 56.4 (SE 5.69) and for males it was 110 (SE 49) km². Tigers crossed an average of 5 water channels > 30 meters per day with a mean width of 54 meters, whereas channels larger than 400 meters were rarely crossed. Tigers spent over 58% of their time within Phoenix habitat but compositional analysis showed a habitat preference of the order Avicennia-Sonneratia > Phoenix > Ceriops > Barren > Water. Average daily distance moved was 4.6 km (range 0.1–23). Activity of tigers peaked between 05:00 hours and 10:00 hours showing some overlap with human activity. Territory boundaries were demarcated by large channels which tigers intensively patrolled. Extra caution should be taken while fishing or honey collection during early morning in Avicennia-Sonneratia and Phoenix habitat types along wide channels to reduce human-tiger conflict. Considering home-range core areas as exclusive, tiger density was estimated at 4.6 (SE range 3.6 to 6.7) tigers/100 km2 giving a total population of 76 (SE range 59–110) tigers in the Indian Sundarban. Reluctance of tigers to cross wide water channels combined with increasing commercial boat traffic and sea level rise due to climate change pose a real threat of fragmenting the Sundarban tiger population."
https://openalex.org/W2335544039,"Despite recent improvements in patient outcomes using newer androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors, treatment resistance in castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) continues to remain a clinical problem. Co-targeting alternate resistance pathways are of significant interest to treat CRPC and delay the onset of resistance. Both the AKT and MEK signaling pathways become activated as prostate cancer develops resistance to AR-targeted therapies. This pre-clinical study explores co-targeting these pathways in AR-positive prostate cancer models. Using various in vitro models of prostate cancer disease states including androgen dependent (LNCaP), CRPC (V16D and 22RV1) and ENZ-resistant prostate cancer (MR49C and MR49F), we evaluate the relevance of targeting both AKT and MEK pathways. Our data reveal that AKT inhibition induces apoptosis and inhibits cell growth in PTEN null cell lines independently of their sensitivity to hormone therapy; however, AKT inhibition had no effect on the PTEN positive 22RV1 cell line. Interestingly, we found that MEK inhibition had greater effect on 22RV1 cells compared to LNCaP, V16D or ENZ-resistant cells MR49C and MR49F cells. In vitro, combination AKT and MEK blockade had evidence of synergy observed in some cell lines and assays, but this was not consistent across all results. In vivo, the combination of AKT and MEK inhibition resulted in more consistent tumor growth inhibition of MR49F xenografts and longer disease specific survival compared to AKT inhibitor monotherapy. As in our in vitro study, 22RV1 xenografts were more resistant to AKT inhibition while they were more sensitive to MEK inhibition. Our results suggest that targeting AKT and MEK in combination may be a valuable strategy in prostate cancer when both pathways are activated and further support the importance of characterizing the dominant oncogenic pathway in each patient’s tumor in order to select optimal therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2325423081,"(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant polyphenol in green tea, mediates the oxidative modification of proteins, generating protein carbonyls. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we analyzed the EGCG-derived intermediates generated upon incubation with the human serum albumin (HSA) and established that EGCG selectively oxidized the lysine residues via its oxidative deamination activity. In addition, we characterized the EGCG-oxidized proteins and discovered that the EGCG could be an endogenous source of the electrically-transformed proteins that could be recognized by the natural antibodies. When HSA was incubated with EGCG in the phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at 37°C, the protein carbonylation was associated with the formation of EGCG-derived products, such as the protein-bound EGCG, oxidized EGCG, and aminated EGCG. The aminated EGCG was also detected in the sera from the mice treated with EGCG in vivo. EGCG selectively oxidized lysine residues at the EGCG-binding domains in HSA to generate an oxidatively deaminated product, aminoadipic semialdehyde. In addition, EGCG treatment results in the increased negative charge of the protein due to the oxidative deamination of the lysine residues. More strikingly, the formation of protein carbonyls by EGCG markedly increased its cross-reactivity with the natural IgM antibodies. These findings suggest that many of the beneficial effects of EGCG may be partly attributed to its oxidative deamination activity, generating the oxidized proteins as a target of natural antibodies."

In this report, we demonstrate that, after ligand stimulation, the PDGF β receptor (PDGFRβ) becomes ubiquitinated in a manner requiring both the c-Cbl and Cbl-b ubiquitin ligases. Simultaneous depletion of c-Cbl and Cbl-b resulted in reduced ligand-induced PDGFRβ clearance from the cell surface because of reduced endocytosis of the receptor. Cbl-b formed a complex with c-Cbl, as well as with the PDGFRβ, in response to PDGF-BB stimulation. We were unable to find a direct interaction between the receptor and c-Cbl, raising the possibility that Cbl-b is necessary for c-Cbl to interact with PDGFRβ. Phosphorylated Tyr-1021 in PDGFRβ was the primary interaction site for Cbl-b, with some contribution from Tyr-1009. Depletion of c-Cbl and Cbl-b led to an increased ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2334874375,"Auxins are the key players in plant growth development involving leaf formation, phototropism, root, fruit and embryo development. Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid (Aux/IAA) are early auxin response genes noted as transcriptional repressors in plant auxin signaling. However, many studies focus on Aux/ARF gene families and much less is known about the Aux/IAA gene family in Brassica rapa (B. rapa). Here we performed a comprehensive genome-wide analysis and identified 55 Aux/IAA genes in B. rapa using four conserved motifs of Aux/IAA family (PF02309). Chromosomal mapping of the B. rapa Aux/IAA (BrIAA) genes facilitated understanding cluster rearrangement of the crucifer building blocks in the genome. Phylogenetic analysis of BrIAA with Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Zea mays identified 51 sister pairs including 15 same species (BrIAA-BrIAA) and 36 cross species (BrIAA-AtIAA) IAA genes. Among the 55 BrIAA genes, expression of 43 and 45 genes were verified using Genebank B. rapa ESTs and in home developed microarray data from mature leaves of Chiifu and RcBr lines. Despite their huge morphological difference, tissue specific expression analysis of BrIAA genes between the parental lines Chiifu and RcBr showed that the genes followed a similar pattern of expression during leaf development and a different pattern during bud, flower and siliqua development stages. The response of the BrIAA genes to abiotic and auxin stress at different time intervals revealed their involvement in stress response. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms between IAA genes of reference genome Chiifu and RcBr were focused and identified. Our study examines the scope of conservation and divergence of Aux/IAA genes and their structures in B. rapa. Analyzing the expression and structural variation between two parental lines will significantly contribute to functional genomics of Brassica crops and we belive our study would provide a foundation in understanding the Aux/IAA genes in B. rapa."
https://openalex.org/W2326569900,"Background Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is associated with subclinical systemic atherosclerosis and pulmonary vascular remodelling characterized by intimal hyperplasia and luminal narrowing. We aimed to determine differences in the intimal thickening of systemic and pulmonary arteries in COPD subjects and smokers. Secondary aims include comparisons with a non-smokers group; determining the clinical variables associated with systemic and pulmonary intimal thickening, and the correlations between systemic and pulmonary remodelling changes. Methods All consecutive subjects undergoing lung resection were included and divided into 3 groups: 1) COPD, 2) smokers, and 3) non-smokers. Sections of the 5th intercostal artery and muscular pulmonary arteries were measured by histo-morphometry. Four parameters of intimal thickening were evaluated: 1) percentage of intimal area (%IA), 2) percentage of luminal narrowing, 3) intimal thickness index, and 4) intima-to-media ratio. Results In the adjusted analysis, the systemic arteries of COPD subjects showed greater intimal thickening (%IA) than those of smokers (15.6±1.5% vs. 14.2±1.6%, p = 0.038). In the pulmonary arteries, significant differences were observed for %IA between the 2 groups (37.3±2.2% vs. 29.3±2.3%, p = 0.016). Among clinical factors, metabolic syndrome, gender and COPD status were associated with the systemic intimal thickening, while only COPD status was associated with pulmonary intimal thickening. A correlation between the %IA of the systemic and pulmonary arteries was observed (Spearman’s rho = 0.46, p = 0.008). Conclusions Greater intimal thickening in systemic and pulmonary arteries is observed in COPD patients than in smokers.

The feeding modalities practised were as follows: 0.5% exclusive breastfeeding, 7.9% breastfeeding with unknown exclusivity, 0.08% mixed breastfeeding and 89.2% formula feeding. Mothers with CD4 <200 cells/μl delivered infants with a lower birth WAZ (adjusted ß -0.253 [95% CI -0.043; -0.072], p = 0.006) compared to mothers with aCD4 ≥500 cells/μl. Similarly, mothers who did not receive antiretroviral drugs delivered infants with a lower birth WAZ (adjusted ß -0.39 [95% CI -0.67; -0.11], p = 0.007) compared to mothers who received antenatal antiretrovirals. Infants with a birth weight <2 500g (ß 0.070 [95% CI 0.061; 0.078], p <0.0001) experienced faster growth within the first 28 weeks of life compared to infants with a birth weight ≥2 500g. Infants with any breastfeeding exposure experienced slower longitudinal growth compared to formula fed infants (adjusted ß -0.012 [95% CI 0.021; -0.003], p = 0.011). Conclusion Less severe maternal disease and the use of antiretrovirals positively impacts birth weight in this cohort of South African HEU infants. Formula feeding was common with breastfed infants experiencing marginally slower longitudinal growth."

However, the regulatory framework for approval, implementation and oversight of use of point-of-care hemoglobin meters is suboptimal. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the HemoCue Hb 301, STAT-Site MHgb and URIT-12 point-of-care hemoglobin meters, compared to a central laboratory based reference assay, in a central laboratory and a community based clinic in Durban, South Africa. Differences in performance of the point-of-care assays, compared to the reference assay, were more pronounced in the community based clinic. Results were reasonable for the HemoCue Hb 301, but poor for the STAT-Site MHgb and the URIT-12. Poor test performance of point-of-care hemoglobin meters, and inadequate evaluations and oversight in South Africa, leads to suboptimal clinical care and clinical research, and increased costs. There is a need for proper evaluation and quality assurance of point-of-care tests, the results of which should be made widely available to key stakeholders."

Pollen analysis shows that the new genus Karima belongs to the inaperturate crotonoid group. Analysis of a concatenated molecular dataset combining trnL-F and rbcL sequences positioned Karima as sister to Neoholstia from south eastern tropical Africa in a well-supported clade comprised of genera of subtribes Grosserineae and Neoboutonieae of the inaperturate crotonoid genera. Several morphological characters support the relationship of Karima with Neoholstia, yet separation is merited by numerous characters usually associated with generic rank in Euphorbiaceae. Quantitative ecological data and a conservation assessment supplement illustrations and descriptions of the taxon."
https://openalex.org/W2329818561,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogenetic disorder in women that is characterized by arrested follicular growth and anovulatory infertility. The altered protein expression levels in the ovarian tissues reflect the molecular defects in folliculogenesis. To identify aberrant protein expression in PCOS, we analyzed protein expression profiles in the ovarian tissues of patients with PCOS. We identified a total of 18 protein spots that were differentially expressed in PCOS compared with healthy ovarian samples. A total of 13 proteins were upregulated and 5 proteins were downregulated. The expression levels of heat shock protein 90B1 (HSP90B1) and calcium signaling activator calmodulin 1 (CALM1) were increased by at least two-fold. The expression levels of HSP90B1 and CALM1 were positively associated with ovarian cell survival and negatively associated with caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Knock-down of HSP90B1 with siRNA attenuated ovarian cell survival and increased apoptosis. In contrast, ovarian cell survival was improved and cell apoptosis was decreased in cells over-expressing HSP90B1. These results demonstrated the pivotal role of HSP90B1 in the proliferation and survival of ovarian cells, suggesting a critical role for HSP90B1 in the pathogenesis of PCOS. We also observed a downregulation of anti-inflammatory activity-related annexin A6 (ANXA6) and tropomyosin 2 (TPM2) compared with the normal controls, which could affect cell division and folliculogenesis in PCOS. This is the first study to identify novel altered gene expression in the ovarian tissues of patients with PCOS. These findings may have significant implications for future diagnostic and treatment strategies for PCOS using molecular interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2316385596,"The features contributing to differences in pathogenicity of the Campylobacter fetus subspecies are unknown. Putative factors involved in pathogenesis are located in genomic islands that encode a type IV secretion system (T4SS) and fic domain (filamentation induced by cyclic AMP) proteins, which may disrupt host cell processes. In the genomes of 27 C. fetus strains, three phylogenetically-different T4SS-encoding regions (T4SSs) were identified: one was located in both the chromosome and in extra-chromosomal plasmids; one was located exclusively in the chromosome; and one exclusively in extra-chromosomal plasmids. We observed that C. fetus strains can contain multiple T4SSs and that homologous T4SSs can be present both in chromosomal genomic islands (GI) and on plasmids in the C. fetus strains. The GIs of the chromosomally located T4SS differed mainly by the presence of fic genes, insertion sequence elements and phage-related or hypothetical proteins. Comparative analysis showed that T4SS sequences, inserted in the same locations, were conserved in the studied C. fetus genomes. Using phylogenetic analysis of the T4SSs, it was shown that C. fetus may have acquired the T4SS regions from other Campylobacter species by horizontal gene transfer. The identified T4SSs and fic genes were found in Cff and Cfv strains, although the presence of T4SSs and fic genes were significantly associated with Cfv strains. The T4SSs and fic genes could not be associated with S-layer serotypes or geographical origin of the strains."
https://openalex.org/W2316573519,"The R-spondin family of proteins has recently been described as secreted enhancers of β-catenin activation through the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. We previously reported that Rspo2 is a major determinant of susceptibility to Citrobacter rodentium-mediated colitis in mice and recent genome-wide association studies have revealed RSPO3 as a candidate Crohn's disease-specific inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility gene in humans. However, there is little information on the endogenous expression and cellular source of R-spondins in the colon at steady state and during intestinal inflammation. RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR were used to assess the expression of R-spondins at steady state and in two mouse models of colonic inflammation. The cellular source of R-spondins was assessed in specific colonic cell populations isolated by cell sorting. Data mining from publicly available datasets was used to assess the expression of R-spondins in the human colon. At steady state, colonic expression of R-spondins was found to be exclusive to non-epithelial CD45- lamina propria cells, and Rspo3/RSPO3 was the most highly expressed R-spondin in both mouse and human colon. R-spondin expression was found to be highly dynamic and differentially regulated during C. rodentium infection and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis, with notably high levels of Rspo3 expression during DSS colitis, and high levels of Rspo2 expression during C. rodentium infection, specifically in susceptible mice. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that in the colon, R-spondins are expressed by subepithelial stromal cells, and that Rspo3/RSPO3 is the family member most implicated in colonic homeostasis. The differential regulation of the R-spondins in different models of intestinal inflammation indicate they respond to specific pathogenic and inflammatory signals that differ in the two models and provides further evidence that this family of proteins plays a key role in linking intestinal inflammation and homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2324190612,"We constructed dynamic Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission models to predict epidemic trends and evaluate intervention measure efficacy following the 2014 EVD epidemic in West Africa. We estimated the effective vaccination rate for the population, with basic reproduction number (R0) as the intermediate variable. Periodic EVD fluctuation was analyzed by solving a Jacobian matrix of differential equations based on a SIR (susceptible, infective, and removed) model. A comprehensive compartment model was constructed to fit and predict EVD transmission patterns, and to evaluate the effects of control and prevention measures. Effective EVD vaccination rates were estimated to be 42% (31-50%), 45% (42-48%), and 51% (44-56%) among susceptible individuals in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, respectively. In the absence of control measures, there would be rapid mortality in these three countries, and an EVD epidemic would be likely recur in 2035, and then again 8~9 years later. Oscillation intervals would shorten and outbreak severity would decrease until the periodicity reached ~5.3 years. Measures that reduced the spread of EVD included: early diagnosis, treatment in isolation, isolating/monitoring close contacts, timely corpse removal, post-recovery condom use, and preventing or quarantining imported cases. EVD may re-emerge within two decades without control and prevention measures. Mass vaccination campaigns and control and prevention measures should be instituted to prevent future EVD epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W2325855051,"Tissue dehydration results in three major types of exsiccosis—hyper-, hypo-, or isonatraemia. All three types entail alterations of salt concentrations leading to impaired biochemical processes, and can finally cause severe morbidity. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the feasibility of a microwave-based sensor technology for the non-invasive measurement of the hydration status. Electromagnetic waves at high frequencies interact with molecules, especially water. Hence, if a sample contains free water molecules, this can be detected in a reflected microwave signal. To develop the sensor system, human three-dimensional skin equivalents were instituted as a standardized test platform mimicking reproducible exsiccosis scenarios. Therefore, skin equivalents with a specific hydration and density of matrix components were generated and microwave measurements were performed. Hydration-specific spectra allowed deriving the hydration state of the skin models. A further advantage of the skin equivalents was the characterization of the impact of distinct skin components on the measured signals to investigate mechanisms of signal generation. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a non-invasive microwave-based hydration sensor technology. The sensor bears potential to be integrated in a wearable medical device for personal health monitoring."

These needs are carried out through the detection of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and a response that includes secretion of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In this study, we analyzed how non-coding double-stranded RNA (dsRNAs) act as a DAMP in the skin and how the human cathelicidin AMP LL-37 might influence growth factor production in response to this DAMP. dsRNA alone significantly increased the expression of multiple growth factors in keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. Furthermore, RNA sequencing transcriptome analysis found that multiple growth factors increase when cells are exposed to both LL-37 and dsRNA, a condition that mimics normal wounding. Quantitative PCR and/or ELISA validated that growth factors expressed by keratinocytes in these conditions included, but were not limited to, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC), betacellulin (BTC), EGF, epiregulin (EREG), and other members of the transforming growth factor β superfamily.

https://openalex.org/W2326880434,"Watercraft pose a threat to endangered Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris). Mortality from watercraft collisions has adversely impacted the manatee population's growth rate, therefore reducing this threat is an important management goal. To assess factors that contribute to the risk of watercraft strikes to manatees, we studied the diving behavior of nine manatees carrying GPS tags and time-depth recorders in Tampa Bay, Florida, during winters 2002-2006. We applied a Bayesian formulation of generalized linear mixed models to depth data to model the probability (Pt) that manatees would be no deeper than 1.25 m from the water's surface as a function of behavioral and habitat covariates. Manatees above this threshold were considered to be within striking depth of a watercraft. Seventy-eight percent of depth records (individual range 62-86%) were within striking depth (mean = 1.09 m, max = 16.20 m), illustrating how vulnerable manatees are to strikes. In some circumstances manatees made consecutive dives to the bottom while traveling, even in areas >14 m, possibly to conserve energy. This is the first documentation of potential cost-efficient diving behavior in manatees. Manatees were at higher risk of being within striking depth in shallow water (<0.91 m), over seagrass, at night, and while stationary or moving slowly; they were less likely to be within striking depth when ≤50 m from a charted waterway. In shallow water the probability of a manatee being within striking depth was 0.96 (CI = 0.93-0.98) and decreased as water depth increased. The probability was greater over seagrass (Pt = 0.96, CI = 0.93-0.98) than over other substrates (Pt = 0.73, CI = 0.58-0.84). Quantitative approaches to assessing risk can improve the effectiveness of manatee conservation measures by helping identify areas for protection."

Nevertheless, their taking an active role in an ehealth environment depends on their possessing the appropriate skills and mindset. The main objective of this paper was to assess nurses' opinions and to analyze the predictors of their acceptance of ehealth features relevant to patient empowerment with a strong focus on chronic care.A survey was conducted among nurses from hospital centers of south-eastern Poland based on a questionnaire designed to assess their attitudes toward the ehealth domain. The predictors of the nurses' acceptance of ehealth usage within specific contexts were assessed with uni- and multivariate logistic regression.An analysis was performed on data from 648 questionnaires retained after a quality check. The duration of Internet use was consistently related to higher acceptance of ehealth applications and more certainty regarding the reliability of health-related information available on the Internet. Nurses from urban medical centers were more skeptical about the use of specific ehealth solutions.Previous experience in using information technologies is the main factor influencing the acceptance of specific ehealth solutions relevant for care provided to patients suffering from chronic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2330920071,"Overexpression or activation of cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) has been known to be involved in several human malignancies, including lung cancer. Genes regulated by CREB have been reported to suppress apoptosis, induce cell proliferation, inflammation, and tumor metastasis. However, the critical target genes of CREB in lung cancer have not been well understood. Here, we identified GSK-3α as one of the CREB target genes which is critical for the viability of lung cancer cells. The CREB knockdown significantly reduced the expression of GSK-3α and the direct binding of CREB on the promoter of GSK3A was identified. Kaplan-Meier analysis with a public database showed a prognostic significance of aberrant GSK-3α expression in lung cancer. Inhibition of GSK-3α suppressed cell viability, colony formation, and tumor growth. For the first time, we demonstrated that GSK-3α is regulated by CREB in lung cancer and is required for the cell viability. These findings implicate CREB-GSK-3α axis as a novel therapeutic target for lung cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2332765387,"Anti-retroviral drugs suppress HIV-1 plasma viremia to undetectable levels; however, latent HIV-1 persists in reservoirs within HIV-1-infected patients. The silent provirus can be activated through the use of drugs, including protein kinase C activators and histone deacetylase inhibitors. This “shock” approach is then followed by “kill” of the producing cells either through direct HIV-1-induced cell death or natural immune mechanisms. However, these mechanisms are relatively slow and effectiveness is unclear. Here, we develop an approach to specifically target and kill cells that are activated early in the process of virus production. We utilize a novel nanocapsule technology whereby the ricin A chain is encapsulated in an inactive form within a polymer shell. Specificity for release of the ricin A toxin is conferred by peptide crosslinkers that are sensitive to cleavage by HIV-1 protease. By using well-established latent infection models, J-Lat and U1 cells, we demonstrate that only within an HIV-1-producing cell expressing functional HIV-1 protease will the nanocapsule release its ricin A cargo, shutting down viral and cellular protein synthesis, and ultimately leading to rapid death of the producer cell. Thus, we provide proof of principle for a novel technology to kill HIV-1-producing cells without effects on non-target cells."

Such youths often exhibit impulsivity, risk-taking, and problems of inhibition. However, relatively little is known about the possible brain bases of these behavioral traits, especially among females. Methods We recruited right-handed female patients, 14–19 years of age, from a university-based treatment program for youths with substance use disorders and community controls similar for age, race and zip code of residence. We obtained 43 T1-weighted structural brain images (22 patients and 21 controls) to examine group differences in cortical thickness across the entire brain as well as six a priori regions-of-interest: 1) medial orbitofrontal cortex; 2) rostral anterior cingulate cortex; and 3) middle frontal cortex, in each hemisphere. Age and IQ were entered as nuisance factors for all analyses. Results A priori region-of-interest analyses yielded no significant differences. However, whole-brain group comparisons revealed that the left pregenual rostral anterior cingulate cortex extending into the left medial orbitofrontal region (355.84 mm2 in size), a subset of two of our a priori regions-of-interest, was significantly thinner in patients compared to controls (vertex-level threshold p = 0.005 and cluster-level family wise error corrected threshold p = 0.05). The whole-brain group differences did not survive after adjusting for depression or externalizing scores. Whole-brain within-patient analyses demonstrated a positive association between cortical thickness in the left precuneus and behavioral disinhibition scores (458.23 mm2 in size). Conclusions Adolescent females with substance use disorders have significant differences in brain cortical thickness in regions engaged by the default mode network and that have been associated with problems of emotional dysregulation, inhibition, and behavioral control in past studies."

Twelve missense or nonsense mutations in AIRE and two chimeric AIRE constructs were generated. A luciferase reporter assay and a pulldown assay using biotinylated INS-class I VNTR probe were performed to examine the transactivation and binding activities of WT, mutant, and chimeric AIREs on the INS-VNTR promoter. Confocal microscopy analysis was performed for WT or mutant AIRE cellular localization. We found that all of the AIRE mutations resulted in loss of transcriptional activation of INS-VNTR except mutant P252L. Using WT/mutant AIRE heterozygous forms to modulate the INS-VNTR target revealed five mutations (R257X, G228W, C311fsX376, L397fsX478, and R433fsX502) that functioned in a dominant negative fashion.

https://openalex.org/W2319654436,"Walruses, Odobenus rosmarus, play a key role in the Arctic ecosystem, including northern Indigenous communities, which are reliant upon walruses for aspects of their diet and culture. However, walruses face varied environmental threats including rising sea-water temperatures and decreasing ice cover. An underappreciated threat may be the large amount of solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) that continues to reach the Arctic as a result of ozone loss. UV has been shown to negatively affect whales. Like whales, walrus skin is unprotected by fur, but in contrast, walruses spend long periods of time hauled-out on land. In this study, we combined the results of histological analyses of skin sections from five Atlantic walruses, Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus, collected in Nunavik (Northern Quebec, Canada) with qualitative data obtained through the interviews of 33 local walrus hunters and Inuit Elders. Histological analyses allowed us to explore UV-induced cellular lesions and interviews with experienced walrus hunters and Elders helped us to study the incidences and temporal changes of UV-induced gross lesions in walruses. At the microscopic scale, we detected a range of skin abnormalities consistent with UV damage. However, currently such UV effects do not seem to be widely observed at the whole-animal level (i.e., absence of skin blistering, erythema, eye cataract) by individuals interviewed. Although walruses may experience skin damage under normal everyday UV exposure, the long-term data from local walrus hunters and Inuit Elders did not report a relation between the increased sun radiation secondary to ozone loss and walrus health."

STAT3 activity is regulated by a variety of mechanisms, including phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. To clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of STAT3 activity, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening. We identified ARL3 (ADP-ribosylation factor-like 3) as a novel STAT3-binding partner. ARL3 recognizes the DNA-binding domain as well as the C-terminal region of STAT3 in vivo, and their binding was the strongest when both proteins were activated. Importantly, small interfering RNA-mediated reduction of endogenous ARL3 expression decreased IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, nuclear accumulation, and transcriptional activity of STAT3. These results indicate that ARL3 interacts with STAT3 and regulates the transcriptional activation of STAT3 by influencing its nuclear accumulation of STAT3."

Given these observations, it is important to examine the underlying construct of depression in groups of substance users compared to non-users. In this study we use a non-clinical sample to examine the measurement structure of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) in non-users and frequent-users of various substances. Specifically, measurement invariance was examined across those who do vs. do not use alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis. Results indicate strict factorial invariance across non-users and frequent-users of alcohol and cannabis, and metric invariance across non-users and frequent-users of nicotine.

Because population performance of these species is also influenced by non-anthropogenic factors, it is important to incorporate all relevant ecological drivers into demographic models. We used design-based sampling and occupancy models to test relationships of environmental factors that influence raptor demographics with re-occupancy of breeding territories by ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis) across Wyoming, USA, 2011-2013. We also tested correlations of territory re-occupancy with oil and gas infrastructure-a leading cause of habitat modification throughout the range of this species of conservation concern. Probability of re-occupancy was not related to any covariates we investigated in 2011, had a strong negative relationship with cover of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) in 2012, was slightly higher for territories with artificial platforms than other nest substrates in 2013, and had a positive relationship with abundance of ground squirrels (Urocitellus spp.) that was strong in 2012 and weak in 2013. Associations with roads were weak and varied by year, road-type, and scale: in 2012, re-occupancy probability had a weak positive correlation with density of roads not associated with oil and gas fields at the territory-scale; however, in 2013 re-occupancy had a very weak negative correlation with density of oil and gas field roads near nest sites (≤500 m). Although our results indicate re-occupancy of breeding territories by ferruginous hawks was compatible with densities of anthropogenic infrastructure in our study area, the lack of relationships between oil and gas well density and territory re-occupancy may have occurred because pre-treatment data were unavailable. We used probabilistic sampling at a broad spatial extent, methods to account for imperfect detection, and conducted extensive prey sampling; nonetheless, future research using before-after-control-impact designs is needed to fully assess impacts of oil and gas development on ferruginous hawks."
https://openalex.org/W2332473107,"Fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines are known as β-diketone antibiotics (DKAs) because of bearing a diketone group in their molecular structure. DKAs are the most widely used antibiotics to prevent generation of disease in humans and animals and to suppress bacterial growth in aquaculture. In recent years, overuse of DKAs has caused serious environmental risk due to their pseudo-persistence in the environment, even though their half-lives are not long. So far, no reports were concerned with the joint immunotoxicity of DKAs. Herein, we reported on the immunotoxicity of DKAs on zebrafish after a 3-month DKAs exposure using transcriptomic techniques. According to transcriptome sequencing, 10 differentially expressed genes were screened out among the genes related to KEGG pathways with high enrichment. The identified 7 genes showed to be consistent between RNA-seq and qRT-PCR. Due to DKAs exposure, the content or activity for a series of immune-related biomarkers (Complement 3, lysozyme, IgM and AKP) showed the inconsistent changing trends as compared with the control group. Histopathological observations showed that the number of goblet cells increased sharply, the columnar epithelial cells swelled, the nucleus became slender in intestinal villi, and numerous brown metachromatic granules occurred in spleens of DKAs-exposed groups. Overall, both detection of biomarkers and histopathological observation corroborated that chronic DKAs exposure could result in abnormal expression of immune genes and enzymes, and variable levels of damage to immune-related organs. These complex effects of DKAs may lead to zebrafish dysfunction and occurrence of diseases related to the immune system."

Here the aim was to examine interlimb reflexes at rest in participants with chronic (>1 year) spinal cord injury (SCI, n = 17) and able-bodied control participants (n = 5). Cutaneous reflexes were evoked by delivering up to 30 trains of stimuli to either the superficial peroneal nerve on the dorsum of the foot or the radial nerve at the wrist (5 pulses, 300 Hz, approximately every 30 s). Participants were instructed to relax the test muscles prior to the delivery of the stimuli. Electromyographic activity was recorded bilaterally in proximal and distal arm and leg muscles. Superficial peroneal nerve stimulation evoked interlimb reflexes in ipsilateral and contralateral arm and contralateral leg muscles of SCI and control participants. Radial nerve stimulation evoked interlimb reflexes in the ipsilateral leg and contralateral arm muscles of control and SCI participants but only contralateral leg muscles of control participants. Interlimb reflexes evoked by superficial peroneal nerve stimulation were longer in latency and duration, and larger in magnitude in SCI participants. Interlimb reflex properties were similar for both SCI and control groups for radial nerve stimulation. Ascending interlimb reflexes tended to occur with a higher incidence in participants with SCI, while descending interlimb reflexes occurred with a higher incidence in able-bodied participants. However, the overall incidence of interlimb reflexes in SCI and neurologically intact participants was similar which suggests that the neural circuitry underlying these reflexes does not necessarily develop after central nervous system injury."

In 690.31 camera days (16567.45 hours) we captured 92 independent videos showing S. blouchi. Variation in S. blouchi trapping rates with cumulative trap effort stabilized after 500 camera days. An important outcome is that, in contrast to the suggestion of previous assessments, only S. blouchi was detected and no S. scrofa was found, which excludes hybridization threats. We fitted a Random Encounter Model, which does not require the identification of individual animals, to our camera-trapping data and estimated 172–377 individuals to be present on the island. Activity patterns and habitat data indicate that S. blouchi is mainly nocturnal and prefers community forests and areas near forest borders. Next to this, we found a positive relationship between S. blouchi occupancy, distance to nearest border, litter depth and tree density in the highest ranking occupancy models. Although these relationships proved non-significant based on model averaging, their presence in the top ranking models suggests that these covariables do play a role in predicting S. blouchi occurrence on Bawean. The estimated amount of sites occupied reached 58%. Based on our results, especially the estimation of the population size and area of occupancy, we determine that the species is Endangered according to the IUCN/SSC Red List criteria."
https://openalex.org/W2326370678,"Cryptococcus gattii is a resurgent fungal pathogen that primarily infects immunocompetent hosts. Thus, it poses an increasingly significant impact on global public health; however, the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain largely unknown. We conducted a detailed characterization of the deubiquitinase Ubp5 in the biology and virulence of C. gattii using the hypervirulent strain R265, and defined its properties as either distinctive or shared with C. neoformans. Deletion of the C. gattii Ubp5 protein by site-directed disruption resulted in a severe growth defect under both normal and stressful conditions (such as high temperature, high salt, cell wall damaging agents, and antifungal agents), similar to the effects observed in C. neoformans. However, unlike C. neoformans, the C. gattii ubp5Δ mutant displayed a slight enhancement of capsule and melanin production, indicating the evolutionary convergence and divergence of Ubp5 between these two sibling species. Attenuated virulence of the Cg-ubp5Δ mutant was not solely due to its reduced thermotolerance at 37°C, as shown in both worm and mouse survival assays. In addition, the assessment of fungal burden in mammalian organs further indicated that Ubp5 was required for C. gattii pulmonary survival and, consequently, extrapulmonary dissemination. Taken together, our work highlights the importance of deubiquitinase Ubp5 in the virulence composite of both pathogenic cryptococcal species, and it facilitates a better understanding of C. gattii virulence mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2334607056,"The shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) is a highly migratory pelagic shark that preferentially inhabits oceanic regions in practically all oceans. The wide distribution range of this species renders it susceptible to coastal and oceanic fishing operations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) consider this species to be highly vulnerable, especially due to its biological parameters, which are different from those of other sharks that occupy the same niche (e.g., Prionace glauca). Consequently, considerable declines in abundance have been detected over various parts of its range, most of which are linked to oceanic longline fishing. The species has conflicting life history parameters in studies conducted in the last 30 years, especially with regard to age and growth. The main discrepancies regard the interpretation of the periodicity of the deposition of band pairs (BPs) on vertebrae and the possibility of ontogenetic variations in growth. Shortfin mako sharks (n = 1325) were sampled by onboard observers of the Brazilian chartered pelagic longline fleet based in northeast Brazil from 2005 to 2011. Lengths were 79 to 250 and 73 to 296 cm (fork length, FL) for males and females, respectively, with a statistically significant difference in size between sexes and differences in the proportion of individuals in each size class. The onboard observers collected a subsample of vertebrae (n = 467), only 234 of which were suitable for analyses. Reliability between readings was satisfactory. However, it was not possible to validate periodicity in the formation of age bands in the sample. Thus, the von Bertalanffy growth function was used to calculate growth rates for the species through the interpretation of BPs in different scenarios: one BP per year (s1), two BPs per year (s2) and two BPs per year until five years of life (s3). Growth parameters varied for both females (Linf = 309.7[s3] to 441.6[s1]; k = 0.04[s1] to 0.13[s3]; t0 = -7.08[s1] and -3.27[s3]) and males (Linf = 291.5[s3] to 340.2[s1]; k = 0.04[s1] to 0.13[s3]; t0 = -7.08[s1] and -3.27[s3]). To advance the understanding of the use of habitat, the first analysis of the spatial distribution of the life stages of the shortfin mako sharks caught by commercial longline fishing operations in the South Atlantic was performed. The findings indicate that the portion of the population exploited by the fleets is predominantly juvenile and future actions should take the following issues into account: improvements in the efficiency of data collection procedures, the reestablishment of the onboard observer program, emergency investments in studies that can contribute to a better understanding of habitat use and life history theory."

Plasma glucose and anthropometric characteristics were collected at birth, 3, and 5 years. After quality assessment, 37 SNPs, which have demonstrated an association with fasting plasma glucose at the genome-wide threshold in adults, were studied. Quantitative trait disequilibrium tests and mixed-effects regressions were conducted to estimate an effect of the SNPs on glucose.Risk alleles for 6 loci increased glucose levels from birth to 5 years of age (ADCY5, ADRA2A, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, GRB10, and TCF7L2, 4.85x10-3 ≤ P ≤ 4.60x10-2). Together, these 6 SNPs increase glucose by 0.05 mmol/L for each risk allele in a genotype score (P = 6.33x10-5). None of the associations described in the present study have been reported previously in early childhood.Our data support the notion that a subset of loci contributing to plasma glucose variation in adults has an effect at birth and in early life."
https://openalex.org/W2330707990,"Xylazine is a potent analgesic extensively used in veterinary and animal experimentation. Evidence exists that the analgesic effect can be inhibited using adenosine 5'-monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitors. Considering this idea, the aim of this study was to investigate whether the AMPK signaling pathway is involved in the central analgesic mechanism of xylazine in the rat. Xylazine was administrated via the intraperitoneal route. Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed and the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, thalamus and brainstem were collected for determination of liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and AMPKα mRNA expression using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and phosphorylated LKB1 and AMPKα levels using western blot. The results of our study showed that compared with the control group, xylazine induced significant increases in AMPK activity in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and cerebellum after rats received xylazine (P < 0.01). Increased AMPK activities were accompanied with increased phosphorylation levels of LKB1 in corresponding regions of rats. The protein levels of phosphorylated LKB1 and AMPKα in these regions returned or tended to return to control group levels. However, in the brainstem, phosphorylated LKB1 and AMPKα protein levels were decreased by xylazine compared with the control (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our data indicates that xylazine alters the activities of LKB1 and AMPK in the central nervous system of rats, which suggests that xylazine affects the regulatory signaling pathway of the analgesic mechanism in the rat brain."
https://openalex.org/W2330131881,"Glycerophospholipids, which are components of biomembranes, are formed de novo by the Kennedy pathway and subsequently mature through the Lands cycle. Lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs) are key enzymes in both pathways and influence the fatty acid composition of biomembranes. Neuronal differentiation is characterized by neurite outgrowth, which requires biomembrane biosynthesis. However, the role of LPLATs in neuronal differentiation remains unknown. In this study, we examined whether LPLATs are involved in neuronal differentiation using all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-treated P19C6 cells. In these cells, mRNA levels of lysophosphatidylethanolamine acyltransferase (LPEAT)-1/membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT)-1 were higher than those in undifferentiated cells. LPEAT enzymatic activity increased with 16:0- and 18:1-CoA as acyl donors. When LPEAT1/MBOAT1 was knocked down with small interfering RNA (siRNA), outgrowth of neurites and expression of neuronal markers decreased in ATRA-treated P19C6 cells. Voltage-dependent calcium channel activity was also suppressed in these cells transfected with LPEAT1/MBOAT1 siRNA. These results suggest that LPEAT1/MBOAT1 plays an important role in neurite outgrowth and function.—Tabe, S., Hikiji, H., Ariyoshi, W., Hashidate-Yoshida, T., Shindou, H., Okinaga, T., Shimizu, T., Tominaga, K., Nishihara, T.

https://openalex.org/W2332122085,"One of the key components in assessing marine sessile organism demography is determining recruitment patterns to benthic habitats. An analysis of serially deployed recruitment tiles across depth (6 and 12 m), seasons (summer and winter) and space (meters to kilometres) was used to quantify recruitment assemblage structure (abundance and percent cover) of corals, sponges, ascidians, algae and other sessile organisms from the northern sector of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Polychaetes were most abundant on recruitment titles, reaching almost 50% of total recruitment, yet covered <5% of each tile. In contrast, mean abundances of sponges, ascidians, algae, and bryozoans combined was generally less than 20% of total recruitment, with percentage cover ranging between 15-30% per tile. Coral recruitment was very low, with <1 recruit per tile identified. A hierarchal analysis of variation over a range of spatial and temporal scales showed significant spatio-temporal variation in recruitment patterns, but the highest variability occurred at the lowest spatial scale examined (1 m-among tiles). Temporal variability in recruitment of both numbers of taxa and percentage cover was also evident across both summer and winter. Recruitment across depth varied for some taxonomic groups like algae, sponges and ascidians, with greatest differences in summer. This study presents some of the first data on benthic recruitment within the northern GBR and provides a greater understanding of population ecology for coral reefs."
https://openalex.org/W2329557754,"Organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1, SLC22A1), like many solute carrier 22 (SLC22) family members, is important for the disposition of clinically important drugs, metabolites and signaling molecules. Several studies suggest that SLC22 family (eg. organic anion transporters or OATs and OCTs) bind and possibly transport prostaglandins with relatively high affinity (submicromolar). The affinities of OCT1 and OATs toward PGE2 and PGF2a reported in these cell-based transport studies are considerably greater than for xenobiotics and natural metabolite substrates—in many cases over 100-fold higher. This raises the possibility that prostaglandins are key endogenous substrates and/or that they act on the transporter in a manner different from other substrates such as xenobiotics and lower affinity metabolites. To further investigate OCT1—prostaglandin interactions, we designed biophysical studies using purified bovine OCT1 (Bos taurus, btOCT1/SLC22A1) with PGE2 analogs, in fluorescently labeled and label-free formats. Using fluorescence polarization (FP), we detected a binding of btOCT1 to the PGE2-Rhodamine conjugate at submicromolar affinity, consistent with affinity data for PGE2 from cells over-expressing the related human OCT1. Using purified native btOCT1 as analyte and biotinylated PGE2 analog as ligand, our data from surface plasmon resonance (SPR) revealed that btOCT1 specifically interacts to PGE2 with KD values in the hundred nanomolar range. BtOCT1 also demonstrated a slow association (ka) in the range of 103 M-1s-1 and an even slower dissociation rate (kd) in the range of 10−4 s-1 for PGE2, suggesting the possibility of a different mode of binding compared to other structurally unrelated transported substrates of low-affinity (eg. drugs, metabolites). Our results complement in vitro transport studies and provide direct evidence that OCT1—which is normally expressed in liver and other tissues—interacts with prostaglandin analogs. While it is not entirely clear from the published literature whether OCTs function as major prostaglandin transporters, the tight binding of the naturally occurring PGE2, as well as the slow dissociation rate, could conceivably affect the transport of lower affinity substrates such as drugs and metabolites by SLC22 transporters. More research is necessary to establish the extent to which individual SLC22 family members actually function as PG transporters in vitro and in vivo and to investigate whether PGs can, independent of being directly transported, alter the ability of SLC22 transporters to handle drugs and other substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2327258900,"In prey-predator systems where the interacting individuals are both fliers, the flight performance of both participants heavily influences the probability of success of the predator (the prey is captured) and of the prey (the predator is avoided). While the flight morphology (an estimate of flight performance) of predatory wasps has rarely been addressed as a factor that may contribute to explain prey use, how the flight morphology of potential prey influences the output of predator-prey encounters has not been studied. Here, we hypothesized that flight morphology associated with flight ability (flight muscle mass to body mass ratio (FMR) and body mass to wing area ratio (wing loading, WL)) of Diptera affect their probability of being captured by specialized Diptera-hunting wasps (Bembix merceti and B. zonata), predicting a better manoeuvrability and acceleration capacity achieved by higher FMR and lower WL, and flight speed achieved by higher WL. In addition, wasp species with better flight morphology should be less limited by an advantageous Diptera flight morphology. Overall, the abundance of dipterans in the environment explained an important part of the observed variance in prey capture rate. However, it was not the only factor shaping prey capture. First, higher prey abundance was associated with greater capture rate for one species (B. merceti), although not for the other one. Second, the interaction observed between the environmental dipteran availability and dipteran WL for B. zonata suggests that greater dipteran WL (this probably meaning high cruising speed) decreased the probability of being captured, as long as fly abundance was high in the environment. Third, greater dipteran FMR (which likely means high manoeuvrability and acceleration capacity) helped to reduce predation by B. merceti if, again, dipterans were abundant in the environment. Wasp WL only varied with body mass but not between species, thereby hardly accounting for inter-specific differences in the wasps’ predatory patterns. However, the greater FMR of B. zonata, which implies better flight performance and greater load-lifting capacity, may explain why the capture rate in the two wasp species is affected by different factor interactions. In conclusion, although prey availability remains the primary factor shaping prey use, prey flight morphology seems to gain an additional role under conditions of abundant prey, when wasps can avoid flies with better flight ability."
https://openalex.org/W2329833259,"Classification based on social dimensions is commonly used to handle the multi-label classification task in heterogeneous networks. However, traditional methods, which mostly rely on the community detection algorithms to extract the latent social dimensions, produce unsatisfactory performance when community detection algorithms fail. In this paper, we propose a novel behavior based social dimensions extraction method to improve the classification performance in multi-label heterogeneous networks. In our method, nodes' behavior features, instead of community memberships, are used to extract social dimensions. By introducing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to model the network generation process, nodes' connection behaviors with different communities can be extracted accurately, which are applied as latent social dimensions for classification. Experiments on various public datasets reveal that the proposed method can obtain satisfactory classification results in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods on smaller social dimensions."
