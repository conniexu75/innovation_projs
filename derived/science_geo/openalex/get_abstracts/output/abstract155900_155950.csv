https://openalex.org/W2104058491,"The location of follicular and epidermal stem cells in mammalian skin is a crucial issue in cutaneous biology. We demonstrate that hair follicular stem cells, located in the bulge region, can give rise to several cell types of the hair follicle as well as upper follicular cells. Moreover, we devised a double-label technique to show that upper follicular keratinocytes emigrate into the epidermis in normal newborn mouse skin, and in adult mouse skin in response to a penetrating wound. These findings indicate that the hair follicle represents a major repository of keratinocyte stem cells in mouse skin, and that follicular bulge stem cells are potentially bipotent as they can give rise to not only the hair follicle, but also the epidermis."
https://openalex.org/W2081099987,"It is well known that histone acetylases are important chromatin modifiers and that they play a central role in chromatin transcription. Here, we present evidence for novel roles of histone acetylases. The TIP60 histone acetylase purifies as a multimeric protein complex. Besides histone acetylase activity on chromatin, the TIP60 complex possesses ATPase, DNA helicase, and structural DNA binding activities. Ectopic expression of mutated TIP60 lacking histone acetylase activity results in cells with defective double-strand DNA break repair. Importantly, the resulting cells lose their apoptotic competence, suggesting a defect in the cells' ability to signal the existence of DNA damage to the apoptotic machinery. These results indicate that the histone acetylase TIP60-containing complex plays a role in DNA repair and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2015291446,"Ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s) regulate diverse cellular processes by mediating protein ubiquitination. The c-Cbl proto-oncogene is a RING family E3 that recognizes activated receptor tyrosine kinases, promotes their ubiquitination by a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and terminates signaling. The crystal structure of c-Cbl bound to a cognate E2 and a kinase peptide shows how the RING domain recruits the E2. A comparison with a HECT family E3-E2 complex indicates that a common E2 motif is recognized by the two E3 families. The structure reveals a rigid coupling between the peptide binding and the E2 binding domains and a conserved surface channel leading from the peptide to the E2 active site, suggesting that RING E3s may function as scaffolds that position the substrate and the E2 optimally for ubiquitin transfer."

https://openalex.org/W2067761409,"Secreted signaling proteins of the Hedgehog family organize spatial pattern during animal development. Two integral membrane proteins have been identified with distinct roles in Hedgehog signaling. Patched functions in Hedgehog binding, and Smoothened functions in transducing the signal. Current models view Patched and Smoothened as a preformed receptor complex that is activated by Hedgehog binding. Here we present evidence that Patched destabilizes Smoothened in the absence of Hedgehog. Hedgehog binding causes removal of Patched from the cell surface. In contrast, Hedgehog causes phosphorylation, stabilization, and accumulation of Smoothened at the cell surface. Comparable effects can be produced by removing Patched from cells by RNA-mediated interference. These findings raise the possibility that Patched acts indirectly to regulate Smoothened activity."

https://openalex.org/W2019738475,"Ion channels have been studied extensively in ambient O2 tension (pO2), whereas tissue pO2 is much lower. The skeletal muscle calcium release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is one prominent example. Here we report that pO2 dynamically controls the redox state of 6–8 out of 50 thiols in each RyR1 subunit and thereby tunes the response to NO. At physiological pO2, nanomolar NO activates the channel by S-nitrosylating a single cysteine residue. Among sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins, S-nitrosylation is specific to RyR1 and its effect on the channel is calmodulin dependent. Neither activation nor S-nitrosylation of the channel occurs at ambient pO2. The demonstration that channel cysteine residues subserve coupled O2 sensor and NO regulatory functions and that these operate through the prototypic allosteric effector calmodulin may have general implications for the regulation of redox-related systems."
https://openalex.org/W2109009498,"Positioning of the translation initiation complex on mRNAs requires interaction between the anticodon of initiator Met-tRNA, associated with eIF2-GTP and 40S ribosomal subunit, and the cognate start codon of the mRNA. We show that an internal ribosome entry site located in the genome of cricket paralysis virus can form 80S ribosomes without initiator Met-tRNA, eIF2, or GTP hydrolysis, with a CCU triplet in the ribosomal P site and a GCU triplet in the A site. P-site mutagenesis revealed that the P site was not decoded, and protein sequence analysis showed that translation initiates at the triplet in the A site. Translational initiation from the A site of the ribosome suggests that the repertoire of translated open reading frames in eukaryotic mRNAs may be greater than anticipated."

https://openalex.org/W2061680089,"Specific A-to-I RNA editing, like that seen in mammals, has been reported for several Drosophila ion channel genes. Drosophila possesses a candidate editing enzyme, dADAR. Here, we describe dADAR deletion mutants that lack ADAR activity in extracts. Correspondingly, all known Drosophila site-specific RNA editing (25 sites in three ion channel transcripts) is abolished. Adults lacking dADAR are morphologically wild-type but exhibit extreme behavioral deficits including temperature-sensitive paralysis, locomotor uncoordination, and tremors which increase in severity with age. Neurodegeneration accompanies the increase in phenotypic severity. Surprisingly, dADAR mutants are not short-lived. Thus, A-to-I editing of pre-mRNAs in Drosophila acts predominantly through nervous system targets to affect adult nervous system function, integrity, and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2075654456,"It has been proposed that tissue-specific estrogenic and/or antiestrogenic actions of certain xenoestrogens may be associated with alterations in the tertiary structure of estrogen receptor (ER) α and/or ERβ following ligand binding; changes which are sensed by cellular factors (coactivators) required for normal gene expression. However, it is still unclear whether xenoestrogens affect the normal behavior of ERα and/or ERβ subsequent to receptor binding. In view of the wide range of structural forms now recognized to mimic the actions of the natural estrogens, we have assessed the ability of ERα and ERβ to recruit TIF2 and SRC-1a in the presence of 17β-estradiol, genistein, diethylstilbestrol, 4-tert-octylphenol, 2′,3′,4′,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl-ol, and bisphenol A. We show that ligand-dependent differences exist in the ability of ERα and ERβ to bind coactivator proteinsin vitro, despite the similarity in binding affinity of the various ligands for both ER subtypes. The enhanced ability of ERβ (over ERα) to recruit coactivators in the presence of xenoestrogens was consistent with a greater ability of ERβ to potentiate reporter gene activity in transiently transfected HeLa cells expressing SRC-1e and TIF2. We conclude that ligand-dependent differences in the ability of ERα and ERβ to recruit coactivator proteins may contribute to the complex tissue-dependent agonistic/antagonistic responses observed with certain xenoestrogens.

The recent discovery of a second subtype of the estrogen receptor, named estrogen receptor-β (ERβ) to distinguish it from the classical ER (now renamed ERα), adds another level of complexity to the mechanism of estrogen action and has opened new possibilities by which estrogens might exert tissue- and cell-specific effects (1Kuiper G.G.J.M. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4216) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown that ΕRα and ERβ differ in terms of their ability to activate gene expression from either the consensus estrogen response element (ERE) from the VTG gene or the divergent ERE from the luteinizing hormone β gene in transiently transfected Cos-1 cells (2Pennie W.D. Aldridge T.C. Brooks A.N. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: R11-R14Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, ΕRα and ERβ activate and inhibit, respectively, transcription from an AP1 enhancer site when complexed to 17β-estradiol (E2), whereas ERβ was a transcriptional activator on AP1 sites when complexed to antiestrogens (3Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G.J.M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-Å Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). Studies in rodents have revealed that the distribution and relative levels of ΕRα and ERβ expression differ among tissues. For example, ΕRα is predominantly expressed in the pituitary, uterus, ovary (oviduct and germinal epithelium), mammary gland, testis, epididymis, and kidney, whereas ERβ is the predominant form in regions of the hypothalamus, ovary (granulosa cells), prostate gland, lung, and bladder (4Shughrue P.J.

The coexpression of ΕRα and ERβ in certain tissues and cells, and the ability of ΕRα and ERβ to form heterodimers and bind to a consensus EREs in vitro, suggests that alternative estrogen signaling pathways may exist in cells expressing both ER isoforms (9Cowley S.M.

Gustafsson J.- Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1486-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), although this remains to be proven in vivo. Estrogen receptors activate transcription of target genes via two activation functions; AF-1 (in the N-terminal domain) is ligand-independent and is regulated by phosphorylation in response to growth factors (11Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar), whereas AF-2 is closely associated with the LBD and depends on ligand binding for its transcriptional activity. The activities of AF-1 and AF-2 of the ER vary depending upon the responsive promoter (12Metzger D. Losson R. Bornert J.-M. Lemoine Y. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2813-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and cell type, and in some cases both are required for full transcriptional activation of target genes (13Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 14Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielian P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid homology within the LBD of rat ERα and ERβ does not exceed 55%, a number of residues required for ligand binding and for the formation of the hydrophobic pocket are highly conserved between the two receptor isoforms. Therefore, the reported similarity in the relative binding affinities of ERα and ERβ for a range of natural and synthetic estrogens may have been anticipated (15Kuiper G.G.J.M. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Häggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J-Å. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar, 16Kuiper G.G.J.M. Lemmen J.G. Carlsson B. Corton J.C. Safe S.H. van der Saag P.T van der Burg B. Gustafsson J.-Å. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4252-4263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, ERα and ERβ contain a region of relatively low amino acid homology within the LBD, a region that has been shown to be accessible to proteolytic attack (17Seielstad D.A. Carlson K.E. Kushner P.J. Greene G.L. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12605-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and is therefore likely to contain residues on an exposed surface of the receptor, which may be involved in subsequent receptor-protein interactions. The ligand-dependent transactivation domain AF-2 is of particular interest because it has provided a mechanistic explanation for the observed functional differences between agonists and antagonists of the ER. It is now believed that the primary role of 17β-estradiol binding to the ER is to induce a conformational change in the tertiary structure of the ER, which subsequently affects the alignment of a highly conserved amphipathic α-helix (helix 12) within AF-2 (18Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Correct alignment of helix 12 (in the presence of 17β-estradiol), exposes residues that interact with other proteins (known as transcriptional intermediary factors or coactivators) necessary for the formation of a stable pre-initiation complex (19Klinge C.M. Abdulmaged M.T. Driscoll M.D. Hilf R. Bambara R.A. Steroids. 1996; 61: 278-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas it is misaligned with the estrogen antagonist raloxifen (20Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that ERα and/or ERβ may display different profiles for coactivator protein recruitment depending on the structure of the ligand. A surprising number of proteins have now been identified that exhibit all the properties expected for mediators of AF-2, i.e. (i) they interact in vivo with nuclear receptors in an agonist-dependent manner, (ii) they bind directly to the ligand-binding domain in an agonist- and AF-2-integrity-dependent manner in vitro, (iii) they harbor an autonomous transcriptional activation function, (iv) they relieve nuclear squelching, and (v) they enhance the activity of some nuclear receptor AF-2s when overexpressed in mammalian cells (21Voegel J.J.

The recruitment of these proteins to activated receptors is mediated by α-helical LXXLL motifs (34Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar) in which L denotes leucine andX denotes any amino acid. It was recently shown (using a range of short peptide sequences directed toward the surface of the ER) that a range of natural and synthetic estrogens/anti-estrogens induced distinct conformational changes in the tertiary structure of ERα and/or ERβ (35Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Grøn H. Norris J.D. Gottlin E.B. Padilla K.M. Chang C.-Y. Ballas L.M. Hamilton P.T. McDonnell D.P. Fowlkes D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3999-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that the tissue-specific estrogenic and/or antiestrogenic actions of certain xenoestrogens may be associated with distinct changes in the tertiary structure of ERα and/or ERβ following ligand binding; changes that are sensed by cellular factors required for normal gene expression. Indeed, ERα was recently reported to display ligand-dependent selectivity for coactivator recruitment in a two-hybrid system (expressing chimeric ERα and coactivator fusion proteins) in yeast (36Nishikawa J.-i. Saito K. Goto J. Dakeyama F. Matsuo M. Hishihara T. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 154: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In view of the wide range of chemical structures now known to mimic the actions of the natural estrogens (37Jobling S. Reynolds T. White R. Parker M.G. Sumpter J.P. Environ. Health. Perspect. 1995; 103: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), GST pull-down assays were used to assess the ability of both ERα and ERβ to recruit transcriptional intermediary factor-2 (TIF2) and steroid receptor coactivator-1a (SRC-1a) in vitro, with 17β-estradiol, genistein (Gen, a phytoestrogen), diethylstilbestrol (DES, a stilbene), 4-tert-octylphenol (OP, an alkylphenol), 2′,3′,4′,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl-ol (PCB-OH, a PCB metabolite), and bisphenol A (Bis-A, a biphenolic compound). We show that ERα and ERβ differ in terms of their ability to recruit SRC-1a and TIF2 with the various xenoestrogens in vitro, despite the two receptors having relatively similar binding affinities for these compounds. The enhanced ability of ERβ to recruit coactivatorsin vitro, in the presence of xenoestrogens, was also consistent with the greater capacity of ERβ to potentiate reporter gene expression in transiently transfected HeLa cells carrying expression plasmids for SRC-1e and TIF2 relative to ERα. 17β-Estradiol (≥98% pure), genistein (≥98% pure), diethylstilbestrol (≥99% pure), and bisphenol A (≥97% pure) were purchased from Sigma (Dorset, United Kingdom (UK)) and were research grade chemicals. 2′,3′,4′,5′-Tetrachlorobiphenyl-ol (95+% pure) was supplied by Greyhound Chemical Service (Merseyside, UK). 4-tert-Octylphenol (98% pure) was supplied by Schenectady International Inc. (Schenectady, NY). All stock solutions were made up in Me2SO (Sigma). The expression plasmids GST-AF2α, GST-SRC1a, pSG5-SRC1e, pGal4-AF2α (27Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G.

The reporter plasmid p(Gal4)5.TK.GL3 (27Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) is based on the pGL3 (firefly luciferase) series of vectors (Promega), and the internal control was the Renilla luciferase plasmid pRLCMV. The amount of DNA used in the transfection assays was adjusted using pMT2 (22Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). All in vitro translations were performed using a TNT®coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, with the appropriate RNA polymerase (T7), according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Radiolabeled proteins were synthesized by substituting 1 mm methionine with [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the reaction mixture. Radiolabeled products from the in vitro translations were analyzed by 8% (35S-TIF2) or 10% (35S-ERα and35S-ERβ) SDS-PAGE, respectively. Ligand binding by ERα and ERβ was assessed using [2,4,6,7-3H]estradiol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A working stock of 3 × 10−8m [2,4,6,7-3H]estradiol was prepared in ethanol. ERα and ERβ proteins were synthesized in vitrofrom the pSG5-expression vectors using the TNT® T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega), and reaction mixtures containing the translated receptors were snap-frozen in 45-μl aliquots at −70 °C until required. [35S]Methionine-radiolabeled translation products (translated in parallel) were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels in order to check the integrity of the ER translation products. Translation products were diluted 20-fold in ligand binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) and kept on ice. Aliquots (45 μl) of 20-fold diluted receptor preparation were saturated with 6 nm[2,4,6,7-3H]17β-estradiol (evaporated to dryness in the tubes) and incubated in the presence, or absence, of various concentrations of competitor (5 μl of chemical in Me2SO) for at least 16 h at 4 °C. The final incubation volume was 50 μl. Free and bound radioligand were separated by adding 50 μl of ice-cold DCC (0.1 g of dextran T70, 1.0 g of activated charcoal, 4.0 ml of 1 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.8 ml of 0.5 mEDTA, made up to a final volume of 400 ml in DW) to each reaction tube. The tubes were mixed briefly, incubated on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the charcoal. 80 μl of supernatant was removed and added directly to β-vials (Pony Vial™, Packard®) containing scintillant (Liquiscint™, National Diagnostics). Bound radioactivity was measured using a TRI-CARB® 2000CA liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard®). Specific binding in the presence of competitor was expressed as a percentage of the maximum binding (calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding). Receptor binding affinity (RBA) was calculated as the ratio of concentrations of E2 or competitor required to reduce the specific radioligand binding by 50% (RBA value for E2 was arbitrarily set at 100 for both receptors). Two types of GST pull-down assays were used to assess the ability of ERα and ERβ to recruit SRC-1a and TIF2 following binding to a range of xenoestrogens. The first employed GST-AF2α or GST-AF2β fusion proteins with in vitrotranslated 35S-TIF2, and the second employed a GST-SRC1a fusion protein with in vitro translated35S-ERα or 35S-ERβ (see Fig. 1).Figure 4Results of GST pull-down assay showing the dose-dependent recruitment of TIF2 by ER α (A) and ER β (B) complexed to a range of xenoestrogens. In vitro translated 35S-TIF2 proteins were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads carrying GST-AF2 fusion proteins with various concentrations of E2, DES, PCB-OH, Gen, OP, or Bis-A. Recruitment of 35S-TIF2 was quantified by scintillation counting as described. Results are expressed arbitrarily as a percentage of the maximum inducible response in the assay.

The ability of radiolabeled TIF2 to interact with the hER was investigated using a GST fusion protein containing the LBD and AF-2 of either hERα or hERβ (A). In contrast, the ability of radiolabeled ERα or ERβ (entire protein) to interact with SRC-1a was investigated using a GST-SRC-1a fusion protein (B). The GST fusion proteins associate with the beads, and the ligands interact with the LBD of the ER. Ligand-induced conformational changes in the tertiary structure of the estrogen receptor are associated with differences in the receptor's ability to interact with coactivator proteins (TIF2 or SRC-1a).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The expression and purification of GST fusion proteins was as described previously (39Kaelin W.G. Pallas Jr., D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In brief, overnight cultures of Eschericia coli, expressing the recombinant GST expression plasmids, were diluted 1:10 in L-Broth medium containing ampicillin (final concentration, 100 mg/liter). The cultures were incubated for an additional 1 h at 37 °C, after which time the cultures were induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactosidase (0.1 mm final concentration). After 4 h, bacteria were collected by centrifugation, resuspended, and concentrated 10-fold in NETN (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors (5 μg of leupeptin/ml, 5 μg of pepstatin/ml, 40 μg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/ml, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μg of aprotonin/ml), sonicated, and centrifuged (∼5000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Bacterial lysates containing the GST fusion proteins were stored in capped Falcon tubes (10-ml aliquots) at −70 °C until required. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were pre-washed in NETN containing protease inhibitors (NETN+P) and 0.5% powdered milk (to minimize nonspecific binding), and were resuspended in one volume of NETN+P. Fusion proteins (GST-AF2α/β or GST-SRC-1a) contained within the bacterial lysates were purified onto the pre-washed glutathione-Sepharose beads (25 μl of beads/ml of lysate) by incubation for 1.5 h at 4 °C on a rotary mixer. The beads (loaded with fusion proteins) were collected by centrifugation, washed four times with NETN+P, and resuspended in one volume of NETN+P prior to use. 50 μl of beads, containing GST fusion proteins or GST alone (negative control), were incubated overnight at 4 °C in Eppendorf tubes containing 845 μl of NETN+P, 80 μl of Me2SO, and 15 μl of the in vitro translated 35S-labeled receptor or coactivator (Fig. 1), in the presence of 10 μl of vehicle or test chemical (in Me2SO). The beads were then washed four times with NETN (all supernatant removed in final wash), dried in a Speed Vac for 30 min, resuspended in 61 μl of 2× protein loading buffer (reducing), and boiled for 4 min to release all the bound proteins from the beads. A 50-μl aliquot of the protein loading buffer was then removed from the tubes; half of this sample was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the remaining half was added directly to β-vials (Pony Vial™, Packard®) containing scintillant (Liquiscint™, National Diagnostics), and the radioactivity was counted using a TRI-CARB® 2000CA liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard®). SDS-PAGE gels were fixed and dried, and the 35S-labeled proteins were visualized by fluorography. The relative recruitment ability (RRA) was calculated using Equation 1.RRA=(concentration E2[50%response]÷concentration chemical[50%response])×100Equation 1 The RRA value for E2 was arbitrarily set at 100 for both receptors. HeLa cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates in phenol red-free medium, and were incubated overnight at 37 °C to reach approximately 30% confluence. Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method, as described previously (18Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The transfected DNA included a reporter plasmid (p(Gal4)5.TK.GL3; 100 ng/well), an internal control plasmid (pRLCMV; 0.5 ng/well), human ER expression vectors (pGal4-AF2α/β; 10 ng/well), the coactivator expression vectors (pSG5-SRC1e or pSG5-TIF2; 10 ng/well), and pMT2 to a total of 120 ng/well. DNA precipitates were prepared in 500-μl volumes, to which 10 μl was added to the appropriate wells. Transfections were allowed to occur overnight, after which time the cells were washed three times with fresh medium and were maintained with no hormone (Me2SO), 17β-estradiol (1 nm), or various concentrations of xenoestrogen as required, using 100 μl of medium/well (Me2SO, 0.1% final concentration). After 24 h, 50 μl of medium was removed from each well and was replaced with LucLite™ substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Packard). The cells were left to lyse at room temperature for 10 min, and the well contents (100 μl containing LucLite reagent, medium, and lysed cells) were transferred to a white microtiter plate where the extracts were assayed for luciferase activity. Transfection efficiency was assessed 10 min after the addition of 25 μl of Renlite reagent (1 mg/ml coelenterazine stock substrate in Me2SO, diluted 100-fold in 0.5 m HEPES, pH 7.8, 20 mmEDTA) to each well. The EDTA within the Renlite reagent chelates the divalent cations required for the firefly luciferase activity and quenches the light emission, allowing the Renilla luciferase activity from pRLCMV to be determined. All treatments were carried out in duplicate (controls; pGL3.basic, p(Gal4)5.TK.GL3 alone, and p(Gal4)5.TK.GL3 plus pSG5-SRC1e or pSG5-TIF2), or quadruplicate (i.e. pGal4-AF2α/β plus p(Gal4)5.TK.GL3 in the presence or absence of pSG5-SRC1e or pSG5-TIF2), and experiments were repeated for consistency. Mean values from a representative experiment are presented. The binding affinities of E2, DES, Gen, PCB-OH, OP, and Bis-A for ΕRα and ERβ were assessed by their ability to compete with [2,4,6,7-3H]17β-estradiol for binding toin vitro translated receptors over a 100,000-fold concentration range (Fig. 2). All of the chemicals tested were able to compete with tritiated 17β-estradiol for binding to both ERα and ERβ in a dose-dependent manner. RBA for ΕRα and ERβ were 53 and 150 for DES, 0.7 and 15 for Gen, 1.6 and 3.0 for PCB-OH, 0.013 and 0.25 for OP, and 0.073 and 0.75 for Bis-A, respectively (Table I). ERβ always had a greater RBA for all the xenoestrogens tested compared with ΕRα. The largest differences in RBA were seen with Gen and OP, which were approximately 20-fold higher with ERβ than ΕRα (Table I).Table IComparison of the RBA of ERα and ERβ for a range of xenoestrogensChemicalRBARatio ERβ/ERαERαERβ17β-Estradiol1001001Diethylstilbestrol531502.8Geniste"

We developed a method to purify metaphase and anaphase chromosomes from frog egg extracts and identified proteins that leave chromosomes at anaphase using a new form of expression screening. This approach identified Xkid, a Xenopus homolog of human Kid (kinesin-like DNA binding protein) as a protein that is degraded in anaphase by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Immunodepleting Xkid from egg extracts prevented normal chromosome alignment on the metaphase spindle. Adding a mild excess of wild-type or nondegradable Xkid to egg extracts prevented the separated chromosomes from moving toward the poles. We propose that Xkid provides the metaphase force that pushes chromosome arms toward the equator of the spindle and that its destruction is needed for anaphase chromosome movement."

Some of these synergistic effects depend on the physical interaction of integrins with growth factor receptors. Here we examine the nature of the physical interaction between the αvβ3 integrin and two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGF-Rβ) and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF-R2, also known as KDR and flk-1). Both of these RTKs associate with the αvβ3 integrin but do not associate with β1 integrins. Furthermore, growth factor stimulation of these RTKs promotes increased cell proliferation and migration when cells are attached to the αvβ3 ligand, vitronectin. We show that αvβ3 in which the β3cytoplasmic domain is deleted or replaced with the β1cytoplasmic domain coimmunoprecipitates with PDGF-Rβ and VEGF-R2. The β3 extracellular domain alone was sufficient for the PDGF-Rβ association whereas the VEGF-R2 association required the presence of the αv subunit. Activation of the RTKs by their ligands was not required for them to associate with the integrin. Cell migration to PDGF was enhanced in the cells transfected with the chimeric subunit containing the β3 extracellular domain but not when that domain came from the β1 subunit.

Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar). Many of the intracellular molecules that mediate integrin signaling also participate in signaling events initiated by soluble growth factors and their transmembrane receptors. Examples of these intracellular molecules include protein kinases, such as c-Src; small GTPases, such as Ras and Rac; phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2; and adaptor molecules, such as Shc (3−5).Another form of cross-talk between integrins and growth factor receptors involves physical interaction between the two classes of proteins and potentiation of growth factor signals upon extracellular matrix binding of the interacting integrin (2Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar). Integrin interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)1 have been studied in some detail. RTKs are transmembrane proteins with an extracellular domain that binds the ligand and an intracellular kinase domain that becomes autophosphorylated upon binding of the ligand to the receptor. Cell adhesion to fibronectin or to antibodies against the β1 integrin subunit causes autophosphorylation of certain RTKs (6Sundberg C. Rubin K. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), even in the absence of the growth factor ligand.Some RTKs interact physically with integrins. The EGF receptor forms a complex with β1 integrins after cells attach to fibronectin (7Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated PDGF-Rβ coprecipitates with αvβ3 but not with β1integrins (9Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 11Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and the VEGF-R2 (12Soldi R. Mitola S. Strasly M. Defilippi P. Tarone G. Bussolino F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, all of these αvβ3-associated growth factor receptors induce increased proliferation and migration in cells attached to the αvβ3 ligand vitronectin. Hence, RTKs selectively interact with certain integrins, and these interactions result in a synergistic signaling effect. However, little is known about the mechanism of the integrin-RTK interaction.The goal of this study was to localize the sites of the αvβ3 integrin that interact with PDGF-Rβ and VEGF-R2. We show that the extracellular domain of the β3 subunit mediates the interaction with PDGF-Rβ and VEGF-R2, whereas the cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions of the β3 subunit are dispensable. We also find that binding of the growth factor ligand by these RTKs and the resultant phosphorylation of the receptor are not required for the αvβ3 interaction. VEGF-R2 requires the αv subunit for efficient association with αvβ3, whereas PDGF-Rβ does not have this requirement.DISCUSSIONThe main new finding in this work is that both PDGF-Rβ and VEGF-R2 associate with the extracellular domain of the β3integrin subunit. Ligand binding and phosphorylation of the RTKs do not seem to be required for the integrin interaction. Our results confirm previous studies that have shown a specific association of PDGF-Rβ (9Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 10Woodard A.S. Garcia-Cardena G. Leong M. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. Languino L.R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 469-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and VEGF-R2 (12Soldi R. Mitola S. Strasly M. Defilippi P. Tarone G. Bussolino F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) with the αvβ3integrin. However, our results differ from earlier observations that indicated the RTK-integrin interaction only occurs after cells are stimulated with the relevant growth factor. In contrast, we found the association to be independent of growth factor stimulation and phosphorylation of the RTK. It may be that the expression of the constituent components of the complex was higher than in the earlier work and that this facilitated the detection of the interaction. Stimulation of cells with growth factors induces localization of RTKs to focal contacts (8Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), thereby increasing the local concentration at sites of integrins. This increased concentration may have favored the formation of the integrin-RTK complexes that were reported in the earlier work.Our results show that the β3 subunit is critical to the RTK association of the αvβ3 integrin. This result agrees with earlier studies showing that other β subunits, which form heterodimers with αv, such as β1or β5, do not associate with PDGF-Rβ or VEGF-R2 (9Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 12Soldi R. Mitola S. Strasly M. Defilippi P. Tarone G. Bussolino F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). A new observation in the present work is that the αvsubunit is necessary for integrin association of VEGF-R2. Thus, unlike PDGF-Rβ, VEGF-R2 was not coprecipitated with the αIIbβ3 integrin or with β3subunits separated from αv. This result shows that the two RTKs interact with the β3 integrins somewhat differently and that the αIIbβ3 integrin can affect the cellular response to PDGF-Rβ but not to VEGF-R2. The physiological significance of the interaction between PDGF-Rβ and αIIbβ3 remains to be determined. The fact that high expression levels of PDGF-Rβ inhibited the association of VEGF-R2 with αvβ3, whereas the reverse was not the case, may also reflect differences in how the two RTKs interact with αvβ3.A surprising finding is that the integrin-RTK association is determined by the extracellular domain of the β3 subunit of the integrin. Growth factor stimulation induces RTK phosphorylation in the intracellular domain. Subsequently, a variety of signaling molecules are recruited to the RTK, resulting in the formation of large intracellular complexes. Integrins also form intracellular complexes, which consist of signaling molecules and cytoskeletal proteins, in response to ligand binding. These complexes accumulate in focal contacts. One might expect that the molecules of these complexes bring together the integrins and the RTKs. However, our integrin truncation and domain-swapping experiments clearly show that the cytoplasmic domain of the β3 integrin is not required for association with the RTKs and that the interaction is determined by the extracellular domain of the β3 subunit. This conclusion is supported by the finding that phosphorylation of the receptors is not necessary for their association with the αvβ3 integrin. Furthermore, as truncation of the β3 cytoplasmic domain prevents the integrin from accumulating in focal adhesions (19Vogel B.E. Lee S-J. Hildebrand A. Craig W. Pierschbacher M.D. Wong-Staal F. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), focal adhesions do not appear to be necessary for the interaction of αvβ3with PDGF-Rβ or VEGF-R2. The exact nature of the complex containing αvβ3 and the RTKs is unclear. Both direct interaction and binding mediated by a third component are viable possibilities. One possible candidate for a third molecule mediator is the integrin-associated protein (IAP-50 or CD47), which is a transmembrane protein that selectively interacts with the extracellular domain of the β3 integrin subunit (20Schaffner-Reckinger E. Gouon V. Melchior C. Plancon S. Kieffer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12623-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).An alternative way for RTKs to associate with integrins is through focal adhesion kinase, which binds directly to PDGF-Rβ and EGF-R (21Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, as this interaction is not specific for the β3 integrin subunit, it is different from the interaction described here and is unlikely to account for the functional cooperation of β3 integrins with RTKs.The association of integrins with RTKs is functionally important. Thus, the ability of the receptors for insulin, PDGF, and VEGF to respond to their growth factor ligands by inducing increased cell proliferation and migration is augmented in the presence of αvβ3 that has bound to one of its extracellular matrix ligands (9Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 10Woodard A.S. Garcia-Cardena G. Leong M. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. Languino L.R. J.

Defilippi P. Tarone G. Bussolino F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The present results show that the ability of the αvβ3 integrin to enhance the activity of PDGF-Rβ in cell migration assays is dependent on the β3 subunit extracellular domain. This result strongly suggests that the integrin RTK extracellular domain interactions we describe here are the physical basis of the functional cooperativity between αvβ3 and RTKs. The integrin-RTK cooperation may make it possible for cell attachment to induce an RTK response independently of the growth factor ligand. Cells that attach to fibronectin (a ligand of αvβ3) show autophosphorylation of PDGF-Rβ (6Sundberg C. Rubin K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and relocation of the receptor to focal contacts (8Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Concentration of integrin-associated RTKs to focal adhesions may explain the finding that a highly phosphorylated subfraction of PDGF-Rβ is associated with αvβ3 (9Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). This subfraction of PDGF-Rβ may also contribute to integrin-mediated signaling, as shown for the EGF-receptor and β1 integrins (7Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). These interactions are likely to be important modulators of growth factor activity in vivo.Both the αvβ3 integrin and two of the associated RTKs, VEGF-R2 and PDGF-Rβ, are important to angiogenesis (22Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Ilic D. Klingbeil C.K. Schaefer E. Damsky C.H. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 23Brooks P.C. Montgomery M.P. Rosenfeld M. Feisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). An understanding of the mechanism underlying the αvβ3 integrin-RTK cooperation may lead to the development of useful compounds for modulating the activity of these growth factors. Soldi et al. (12Soldi R. Mitola S. Strasly M. Defilippi P. Tarone G. Bussolino F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) have shown that anti-αvβ3 antibodies can inhibit VEGF-induced VEGF-R2 phosphorylation and cell migration when endothelial cells are bound to the αvβ3ligand vitronectin. As these antibodies do not interfere with cell attachment, they may disrupt the association between the αvβ3 integrin and VEGF-R2. Such antibodies, and other compounds capable of interfering with this integrin-RTK interaction, could be valuable in preventing unwanted angiogenesis such as that in tumors, arthritic synovium, and the retina. Integrins mediate cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and to other cells. Integrins also initiate intracellular signaling events that control cell shape, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival (1Meredith J.E.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 10Woodard A.S. Garcia-Cardena G. Leong M. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. Languino L.R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 469-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), similar to the insulin receptor (9Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 11Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and the VEGF-R2 (12Soldi R. Mitola S. Strasly M. Defilippi P. Tarone G. Bussolino F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, all of these αvβ3-associated growth factor receptors induce increased proliferation and migration in cells attached to the αvβ3 ligand vitronectin. Hence, RTKs selectively interact with certain integrins, and these interactions result in a synergistic signaling effect. However, little is known about the mechanism of the integrin-RTK interaction. The goal of this study was to localize the sites of the αvβ3 integrin that interact with PDGF-Rβ and VEGF-R2. We show that the extracellular domain of the β3 subunit mediates the interaction with PDGF-Rβ and VEGF-R2, whereas the cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions of the β3 subunit are dispensable. We also find that binding of the growth factor ligand by these RTKs and the resultant phosphorylation of the receptor are not required for the αvβ3 interaction. VEGF-R2 requires the αv subunit for efficient association with αvβ3, whereas PDGF-Rβ does not have this requirement. DISCUSSIONThe main new finding in this work is that both PDGF-Rβ and VEGF-R2 associate with the extracellular domain of the β3integrin subunit. Ligand binding and phosphorylation of the RTKs do not seem to be required for the integrin interaction. Our results confirm previous studies that have shown a specific association of PDGF-Rβ (9Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 10Woodard A.S. Garcia-Cardena G. Leong M. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. Languino L.R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 469-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and VEGF-R2 (12Soldi R. Mitola S. Strasly M. Defilippi P. Tarone G. Bussolino F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) with the αvβ3integrin. However, our results differ from earlier observations that indicated the RTK-integrin interaction only occurs after cells are stimulated with the relevant growth factor. In contrast, we found the association to be independent of growth factor stimulation and phosphorylation of the RTK. It may be that the expression of the constituent components of the complex was higher than in the earlier work and that this facilitated the detection of the interaction. Stimulation of cells with growth factors induces localization of RTKs to focal contacts (8Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), thereby increasing the local concentration at sites of integrins. This increased concentration may have favored the formation of the integrin-RTK complexes that were reported in the earlier work.Our results show that the β3 subunit is critical to the RTK association of the αvβ3 integrin. This result agrees with earlier studies showing that other β subunits, which form heterodimers with αv, such as β1or β5, do not associate with PDGF-Rβ or VEGF-R2 (9Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 12Soldi R. Mitola S. Strasly M. Defilippi P. Tarone G. Bussolino F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). A new observation in the present work is that the αvsubunit is necessary for integrin association of VEGF-R2. Thus, unlike PDGF-Rβ, VEGF-R2 was not coprecipitated with the αIIbβ3 integrin or with β3subunits separated from αv. This result shows that the two RTKs interact with the β3 integrins somewhat differently and that the αIIbβ3 integrin can affect the cellular response to PDGF-Rβ but not to VEGF-R2. The physiological significance of the interaction between PDGF-Rβ and αIIbβ3 remains to be determined. The fact that high expression levels of PDGF-Rβ inhibited the association of VEGF-R2 with αvβ3, whereas the reverse was not the case, may also reflect differences in how the two RTKs interact with αvβ3.A surprising finding is that the integrin-RTK association is determined by the extracellular domain of the β3 subunit of the integrin. Growth factor stimulation induces RTK phosphorylation in the intracellular domain. Subsequently, a variety of signaling molecules are recruited to the RTK, resulting in the formation of large intracellular complexes. Integrins also form intracellular complexes, which consist of signaling molecules and cytoskeletal proteins, in response to ligand binding. These complexes accumulate in focal contacts. One might expect that the molecules of these complexes bring together the integrins and the RTKs. However, our integrin truncation and domain-swapping experiments clearly show that the cytoplasmic domain of the β3 integrin is not required for association with the RTKs and that the interaction is determined by the extracellular domain of the β3 subunit. This conclusion is supported by the finding that phosphorylation of the receptors is not necessary for their association with the αvβ3 integrin. Furthermore, as truncation of the β3 cytoplasmic domain prevents the integrin from accumulating in focal adhesions (19Vogel B.E. Lee S-J. Hildebrand A. Craig W. Pierschbacher M.D. Wong-Staal F. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), focal adhesions do not appear to be necessary for the interaction of αvβ3with PDGF-Rβ or VEGF-R2. The exact nature of the complex containing αvβ3 and the RTKs is unclear. Both direct interaction and binding mediated by a third component are viable possibilities. One possible candidate for a third molecule mediator is the integrin-associated protein (IAP-50 or CD47), which is a transmembrane protein that selectively interacts with the extracellular domain of the β3 integrin subunit (20Schaffner-Reckinger E. Gouon V. Melchior C. Plancon S. Kieffer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12623-12632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).An alternative way for RTKs to associate with integrins is through focal adhesion kinase, which binds directly to PDGF-Rβ and EGF-R (21Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, as this interaction is not specific for the β3 integrin subunit, it is different from the interaction described here and is unlikely to account for the functional cooperation of β3 integrins with RTKs.The association of integrins with RTKs is functionally important. Thus, the ability of the receptors for insulin, PDGF, and VEGF to respond to their growth factor ligands by inducing increased cell proliferation and migration is augmented in the presence of αvβ3 that has bound to one of its extracellular matrix ligands (9Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 10Woodard A.S. Garcia-Cardena G. Leong M. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. Languino L.R. J.

Defilippi P. Tarone G. Bussolino F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The present results show that the ability of the αvβ3 integrin to enhance the activity of PDGF-Rβ in cell migration assays is dependent on the β3 subunit extracellular domain. This result strongly suggests that the integrin RTK extracellular domain interactions we describe here are the physical basis of the functional cooperativity between αvβ3 and RTKs. The integrin-RTK cooperation may make it possible for cell attachment to induce an RTK response independently of the growth factor ligand. Cells that attach to fibronectin (a ligand of αvβ3) show autophosphorylation of PDGF-Rβ (6Sundberg C. Rubin K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and relocation of the receptor to focal contacts (8Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Concentration of integrin-associated RTKs to focal adhesions may explain the finding that a highly phosphorylated subfraction of PDGF-Rβ is associated with αvβ3 (9Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). This subfraction of PDGF-Rβ may also contribute to integrin-mediated signaling, as shown for the EGF-receptor and β1 integrins (7Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). These interactions are likely to be important modulators of growth factor activity in vivo.Both the αvβ3 integrin and two of the associated RTKs, VEGF-R2 and PDGF-Rβ, are important to angiogenesis (22Sieg D.J.

An understanding of the mechanism underlying the αvβ3 integrin-RTK cooperation may lead to the development of useful compounds for modulating the activity of these growth factors. Soldi et al. (12Soldi R. Mitola S. Strasly M. Defilippi P. Tarone G. Bussolino F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) have shown that anti-αvβ3 antibodies can inhibit VEGF-induced VEGF-R2 phosphorylation and cell migration when endothelial cells are bound to the αvβ3ligand vitronectin. As these antibodies do not interfere with cell attachment, they may disrupt the association between the αvβ3 integrin and VEGF-R2. Such antibodies, and other compounds capable of interfering with this integrin-RTK interaction, could be valuable in preventing unwanted angiogenesis such as that in tumors, arthritic synovium, and the retina.

Both phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin enrichment of HDL enhanced the net efflux of cholesterol from SR-BI-expressing COS-7 cells but by two different mechanisms. Phosphatidylcholine enrichment of HDL increased efflux, whereas sphingomyelin enrichment decreased influx of HDL cholesterol. Although similar trends were observed in control (vector-transfected) COS-7 cells, SR-BI overexpression amplified the effects of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin enrichment of HDL 25- and 2.8-fold, respectively. By using both phosphatidylcholine-enriched and phospholipase A2-treated HDL to obtain HDL with a graded phosphatidylcholine content, we showed that SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux was highly correlated (r 2 = 0.985) with HDL phosphatidylcholine content. The effects of varying HDL phospholipid composition on SR-BI-mediated free cholesterol flux were not correlated with changes in either the K d orB max values for high affinity binding to SR-BI. We conclude that SR-BI-mediated free cholesterol flux is highly sensitive to HDL phospholipid composition.

The mechanism by which SR-BI mediates FC flux is uncertain. However, recent studies from our laboratory demonstrated that binding of the acceptor particles to SR-BI is not a requirement for SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux (7Kellner-Weibel G. de la Llera-Moya M.

Rather SR-BI induces a reorganization of the plasma membrane cholesterol, and this reorganization is linked to enhanced FC flux (7Kellner-Weibel G. de la Llera-Moya M. Connelly M.A. Stoudt G.

Regardless of the mechanism, evidence is accumulating to support the importance of SR-BI-mediated FC flux in RCT. Recent studies of Ji and colleagues (17Ji Y. Wang N. Ramakrishnan R. Sehayek E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33398-33402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) showed that either attenuation or overexpression of hepatic SR-BI in mice led to significantly decreased or increased delivery of HDL FC into bile. In addition, the expression of SR-BI in peripheral cells and in foam cells of the arterial wall suggests a role for SR-BI in the removal of FC from the periphery (15Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N.

SR-BI-mediated FC flux requires phospholipid in the acceptor (15Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), and studies have shown that cholesterol efflux from cells is highly correlated with the concentration of HDL phospholipid in serum (20Fournier N. de la Llera Moya M.

Also, the stimulation of cholesterol efflux upon phospholipid supplementation of serum is closely linked to the levels of SR-BI among cell types (14Jian B. de la Llera Moya M. Ji Y. Wang N.

These observations are consistent with epidemiological data demonstrating that humans with low HDL phospholipid levels have a high incidence of coronary artery disease (22Kunz F. Pechlaner C. Erhart R. Fend F. Muhlberger V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1994; 14: 1146-1150Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that changes in HDL phospholipid content may alter SR-BI-mediated FC flux. The current studies explicitly test this hypothesis by determining the effects of manipulating HDL phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin content on both the influx and efflux of FC using SR-BI-expressing COS-7 cells. Our results demonstrate that SR-BI-mediated bi-directional FC flux is highly sensitive to HDL phospholipid content and composition. Tissue culture plasticware was obtained through Falcon (Lincoln, NJ). Calf serum (CS), bovine serum albumin (BSA), unesterified cholesterol, cholesteryl methyl ether, penicillin, streptomycin, and phospholipase A2 (PLA2, fromCrotalus adamanteus venom, P-0790) were purchased from Sigma. [1,2-3H]Cholesterol was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Bovine brain sphingomyelin, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine (DMPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerophosphoserine, (POPS), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine (POPC) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All other reagents and organic solvents were purchased from Fisher. The acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor, compound CP113,818, was a generous gift from Pfizer. POPC small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) containing 15 mol % FC were made as described previously (23Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4775-4782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar procedures were used to make SUV containing 15 mol % cholesterol and also both POPC and POPS (50% mol/mol). HDL2 (1.066 g/ml ≤ d ≤ 1.125 g/ml) and HDL3 (1.125 g/ml ≤ d ≤ 1.210 g/ml) were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (24Hatch F.T. Lees R.S. Adv. Lipid Res. 1968; 6: 1-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Contaminating LDL was removed from HDL2 by heparin-Sepharose column chromatography as described previously (25Bamberger M. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3693-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Prior to use, HDL was dialyzed extensively against 0.9% NaCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and sterilized by filtration through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter. To enrich HDL3 with phospholipid, DMPC, or sphingomyelin, multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) were prepared as described (26Jian B. de la Llera-Moya M. Royer L. Rothblat G. Francone O. Swaney J.B. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 734-744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For enrichment with DMPC, 1–2 mg of HDL3 protein/ml was incubated for 2 h at 24 °C with DMPC MLVs added at doses that ranged from 0.25- to 3-fold the total native amount of HDL3phospholipid. For enrichment with sphingomyelin, MLVs were added in amounts ranging from 0.5- to 20-fold the HDL3 sphingomyelin content (estimated to be 12% of HDL3 total phospholipid), and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Since the phase transition temperature of sphingomyelin is broad, the mixture was then warmed to 42 °C and allowed to slowly cool to 25 °C over a 5-h period. During enrichment with either DMPC or sphingomyelin, control HDL3 was incubated similarly but without adding MLVs. After incubation of the HDL with MLVs, any unreacted MLVs were removed by sequentially filtering the HDL MLV mixture through 0.45- and 0.22-μm filters. After overnight storage at 4 °C, any remaining MLVs were removed from HDL by centrifugation for 30 min at 3,000 × g. The phospholipid to protein ratio of control HDL3 used in these studies ranged from 0.27 to 0.48, and the degree of enrichment for the different HDL preparations is indicated under ”Results.“ Another approach to manipulating the PC content of HDL3 was PLA2 treatment. HDL3 or DMPC-enriched HDL3 (1–2 mg of protein/ml) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 8 mmCaCl2, and 1% BSA (w/v) was incubated at 37 °C from 1.5 to 20 min with 1 μg of PLA2/ml. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 16 mm EDTA. To remove the enzyme and lyso-PC albumin complexes, the HDL3 was isolated by ultracentrifugation for 24 h at d = 1.210 g/ml. Control HDL3 was treated similarly as PLA2-treated HDL3 except without the addition of the enzyme. To remove EDTA, the HDL was dialyzed extensively against 0.15 m NaCl containing 10 mm HEPES. COS-7 cells were maintained on DMEM supplemented with 10% CS and antibiotics. For transfection, cells were seeded in 100-mm plates and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 10% CS. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of the indicated plasmid and diluted in serum-free DMEM and Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (8de la Llera-Moya M. Rothblat G.H. Connelly M.A. Kellner-Weibel G. Sakr S.W. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 575-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid containing mixture was added dropwise to the plated cells. The pSG5 vector (Stratagene, Inc.) with or without murine SR-BI or rat CD36 were prepared using endotoxin-free Qiagen Maxiprep kits (8de la Llera-Moya M. Rothblat G.H. Connelly M.A. Kellner-Weibel G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). After transfection, the cells were removed from the 100-mm plates by trypsinization. The transfected cells were suspended in 10% CS/DMEM containing 2 μg of CP113,818/ml and replated into 12-well plates. One 100-mm plate yielded one 12-well plate. For cholesterol efflux, 1 ml of 10% CS/DMEM containing 6 μCi of [3H]cholesterol/ml and 2 μg of CP113,818/ml was added to the transfected cells immediately after replating. After 24 h of incubation with the labeling medium, the cells were washed once with 1% BSA/DMEM and once with DMEM. Medium containing HDL or phospholipid vesicles at the desired concentration was then added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for varying times. At the indicated time points, 150-μl aliquots of the medium were taken and filtered through 0.45-μm Multiscreen filtration plates. The [3H]cholesterol in 100 μl of filtrate was measured by liquid scintillation counting. In all experiments fractional efflux was corrected for the small amount of [3H]cholesterol released to DMEM without HDL present. Cholesterol influx was measured by using transfected cells prepared in exactly the same way as for efflux, except [3H]cholesterol was not included in the medium. To measure influx, HDL or phospholipid vesicles were labeled by exchanging [3H]cholesterol (20–40 μCi/mg HDL protein or 25 μCi/mg vesicle phospholipid) from the glass wall of a test tube onto which the [3H]cholesterol had been dried under N2. After incubation of the HDL or vesicles with the [3H]cholesterol overnight at 4 °C, the particles were sterilized by filtration through a 0.45 μm filter. The radiolabeled HDL or vesicles were diluted in DMEM and incubated with the unlabeled cells. At each time point, the cells were washed three times with PBS and the cell lipids extracted with isopropyl alcohol. The total [3H]cholesterol present in the total lipid extract was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The unesterified and esterified cholesterol contents of HDL and cells were measured by gas-liquid chromatography as described previously (28Klansek J.J. Yancey P.G. St. Clair R.W. Fischer R.T. Johnson W.J. Glick J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2261-2266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell and HDL protein determinations were done using the method of Lowry et al.(29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Markwell et al. (30Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar). HDL phospholipid was determined by the method of Sokoloff and Rothblat (31Sokoloff L. Rothblat G.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1974; 146: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The sizes of native and modified HDL samples were determined by gel exclusion chromatography on a 25-ml Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, 300 μg of HDL protein in a volume of 400 μl were run at 0.4 ml/min in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl. HDL elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The transfer of FC between cells and HDL has been shown to be a bi-directional process. In the current studies, the kinetic analysis assumes a closed system in which FC exists in one of two pools, either the HDL pool or the cellular pool, and the analysis of flux data was accomplished as described previously (4Johnson W.J. Bamberger M.J. Latta M.J. Rapp R.A. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5766-5776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, the kinetic analysis of the bi-directional flux of FC is not affected by the esterification of cholesterol, as acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase was inhibited during all incubations. A single exponential equation that describes the bi-directional transfer between two pools was fitted to the data by computer (Prism, GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA). The equation is as follows: Y = H 1 e − gt + H 2. Y represents either the fractional uptake of HDL [3H]cholesterol or the fractional retention of [3H]cholesterol by the cells, and t is the incubation time in hours. H 1, g, andH 2 are constants adjusted by the program to fit the equation to the data. The constant g is the sum of the rate constants of efflux (k e) and influx (k i) in fraction/h. The values k eand k i are the initial slopes (t = 0) of the curves describing [3H]cholesterol retention or uptake, respectively. The initial unidirectional efflux (F e) or influx (F i) of FC mass in μg of FC/(h × mg cell protein) are estimated as follows:F e = k e × cell FC mass/mg cell protein and F i = k i × HDL FC mass in total volume of medium/mg cell protein. The initial net flux of FC mass equals F i − F e. It should be noted that the estimates of mass flux do not take into account the contribution of SR-BI-mediated selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester (16Williams D.L. Connelly M.A. Temel R.E.

Native and modified HDL3 particles were dialyzed against PBS, 0.25 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), and iodinated with Na125I using the modified ICL method as described (33Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). The sample was then passed through a PD-10 column equilibrated with PBS, 0.25 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), and dialyzed against PBS, 0.25 mm EDTA, 100 mm KI (pH 7.4), followed by 3 changes of PBS, 0.25 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) at 4 °C. The recovery of iodinated particles was 80–90%. The specific activities for various HDL particles ranged from 146 to 670 cpm/ng of protein. For binding analysis, COS-7 cells were transfected with SR-BI expression plasmid or vector as described above and replated in 24-well plates. Twenty four hours later, the cells were washed 3 times with HEPES-buffered Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 1% BSA. Native or modified HDL particles were then added in the same medium (0.5 ml) to triplicate wells, and the cells were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, the medium was removed and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and an aliquot was used for γ-counting to determine the free ligand concentration. Cells were placed on ice and washed three times with cold medium containing 1% BSA and three times with cold PBS (pH 7.4), followed by solubilization in 0.5 ml of 0.1 NaOH at room temperature. The sample was transferred to a vial for γ-counting after which it was used for protein determination (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SR-BI-specific binding of native or modified HDL was determined by subtracting values for vector-transfected cells from SR-BI-expressing cells to generate a SR-BI-vector curve. Binding parameters for B maxand K d values were obtained for the SR-BI vector curve by nonlinear regression (Prism, GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA) using a one-site binding isotherm as indicated (34Rodrigueza W.V.

Since HDL2 is enriched in phospholipid in comparison to HDL3 (36Eisenberg S. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1017-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), initial studies compared cholesterol efflux from control or SR-BI-expressing COS-7 cells to the two lipoprotein particles (Fig. 1,A and B). At all HDL2 or HDL3 protein concentrations, FC efflux was 5- to 7-fold greater in SR-BI-expressing cells compared with control cells. When the data were normalized to HDL protein, HDL2 was more efficient than HDL3 at stimulating efflux in both SR-BI-expressing (Fig. 1 A) and control cells (Fig.1 B). However, this difference was more pronounced in SR-BI-expressing cells than in control cells. When the efflux values were normalized to HDL phospholipid content (Fig. 1, C andD), there was no difference in efflux efficiency between HDL2 and HDL3 in either control or SR-BI-expressing cells. This demonstrates that the difference in efficiency seen with similar protein concentrations is due to HDL2 being more enriched with phospholipid compared with HDL3.Figure 9Binding of native HDL3 and DMPC-enriched/PLA2-treated HDL to SR-BI. SR-BI-expressing (♦) and vector-transfected (▪) COS-7 cells were incubated with 125I-native HDL3(A) or with modified 125I-HDL3(enriched with DMPC and then treated with PLA2 for 20 min) (B) for 90 min at 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bound HDL3 (ng of HDL protein/mg cell protein) is plotted versus the concentration of free HDL measured at the end of the incubation.

Unphosphorylated c-Abl exhibited substantial peptide kinase activity with K m of 204 μm and V max of 33 pmol min−1. Contrary to previous observations using immune complex kinase assays, we found that a transforming c-Abl mutant with a Src homology 3 domain point mutation (P131L) had significantly (about 6-fold) higher intrinsic kinase activity than wild-type c-Abl (K m = 91 μm,V max = 112 pmol min−1). Autophosphorylation stimulated the activity of wild-type c-Abl about 18-fold and c-Abl P131L about 3.6-fold, resulting in highly active kinases with similar catalytic rates. The autophosphorylation rate was dependent on Abl protein concentration consistent with an intermolecular reaction. A tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation (Y412F) at the c-Abl residue homologous to the c-Src catalytic domain autophosphorylation site impaired the activation of wild-type c-Abl by 90% but reduced activation of c-Abl P131L by only 45%. Mutation of a tyrosine (Tyr-245) in the linker region between the Src homology 2 and catalytic domains that is conserved among the Abl family inhibited the autophosphorylation-induced activation of wild-type c-Abl by 50%, whereas the c-Abl Y245F/Y412F double mutant was minimally activated by autophosphorylation. These results support a model where c-Abl is inhibited in part through an intramolecular Src homology 3-linker interaction and stimulated to full catalytic activity by sequential phosphorylation at Tyr-412 and Tyr-245.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2400-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The mechanism of regulation of Abl tyrosine kinase activity by these processes is not well understood. Ionizing radiation may activate Abl kinase activity through phosphorylation of the Abl catalytic domain at Ser-465 by the Atm kinase (6Baskaran R. Wood L.D. Whitaker L.L. Canman C.E. Morgan S.E. Xu Y. Barlow C. Baltimore D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Kastan M.B. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), whereas platelet-derived growth factor stimulation is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Abl by c-Src (5Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2400-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In contrast, the activation of nuclear c-Abl in S phase is through the detachment of the inhibitor Rb protein (3Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), whereas Abl may be activated by free radicals through dissociation of Pag/Msp23, an antioxidant protein that also inhibits Abl (7Wen S.-T. Van Etten R.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2456-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Abl kinase activity can also be stimulated by the binding of several activator proteins, including the transcription factors c-Jun (8Barila D. Mangano R. Gonfloni S. Kretzschmar J. Moro M. Bohmann D. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and RFX1 (9Agami R. Shaul Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27956-27962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These observations suggest complex regulation of c-Abl at multiple levels through binding or dissociation of activators and inhibitors and via direct phosphorylation. Although the NH2-terminal sequence of c-Abl is very similar to members of the Src family, biochemical and genetic studies suggest that the structural basis of regulation of c-Abl catalytic activity is significantly different from the catalytic activity of Src. When co-expressed with another kinase, such as Csk, that can phosphorylate the COOH-terminal regulatory tyrosine 527, c-Src (and the Src family member Hck) can be purified as an inactive monomer in which the phosphorylated Tyr-527 residue binds the SH21 domain in an intramolecular fashion. In this structure, the SH3 domain contacts the linker region between SH2 and the catalytic domain (the SH2-CD linker) in an atypical interaction involving a single proline (Pro-250) (11Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar,12Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J.

The precise mechanism of physiological activation of Src kinases is unknown, but in vitro studies demonstrate that activation may involve discrete steps that independently increase catalytic activity. In the presence of ATP and magnesium, Src or Hck that is monophosphorylated at the Tyr-527 homologue undergoes slow autophosphorylation at Tyr-412 that increases kinase activity about 10-fold (17Moarefi I.

Dissociation of the SH2-Tyr-527 interaction by dephosphorylation or a competing SH2 ligand stimulates activity 2.5-fold, whereas the disruption of the SH3-linker interaction by an activating SH3 ligand, such as Nef (17Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), induces a further 3-fold increase in catalytic activity to a maximally activated state. Unlike Src kinases, c-Abl lacks phosphotyrosine in its inactive state, and deletion of the C terminus or mutation of SH2 does not activate Abl (20Jackson P. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 21Mayer B.J. Jackson P.K. Van Etten R.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 22Franz W.M. Berger P. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and SH3 point mutations that block PXXP ligand binding (23Van Etten R.A. Debnath J. Zhou H. Casasnovas J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1977-1988PubMed Google Scholar) does stimulate Abl kinase activity in vivo as does the mutation of a proline residue (Pro-242) in the Abl SH2-CD linker region that is homologous to Src Pro-250 (24Barila D. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Whereas the SH2-CD linker mutation implies an intramolecular role for the SH3 domain in Abl regulation, immunoprecipitated c-Abl and SH3-mutated Abl have similar high levels of kinase activity in vitro (22Franz W.M. Berger P. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Van Etten R.A. Debnath J. Zhou H. Casasnovas J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1977-1988PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2883-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), suggesting that the regulatory function of the Abl SH3 domain is only apparent within the cell. An alternative model is that SH3 regulates Abl kinase activity through the binding of a cellular inhibitor (26Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Clark R. McCormick F. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5927-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The expression of c-Abl in cells at up to 10-fold over endogenous levels does not result in Abl autophosphorylation (20Jackson P. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 27Van Etten R.A. Jackson P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 669-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), but the expression at higher levels (20–50-fold) results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Abl and other cellular proteins (7Wen S.-T. Van Etten R.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2456-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 26Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Clark R. McCormick F. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5927-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, c-Abl kinase activity is suppressed when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2B. B. Brasher and R. A. Van Etten, unpublished observations. andXenopus oocytes (28Dorey K. Barila D. Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. Superti-Furga G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; 380: 223-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (29Walkenhorst J. Goga A. Witte O.N. Superti-Furga G. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1513-1520PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that wild-type and SH3-mutated c-Abl have similar intrinsic kinase activity, but the SH3-mutated c-Abl can no longer associate with a cellular inhibitor. By inference, the putative inhibitor is abundant but can be titrated upon the overexpression of Abl, does not efficiently immunoprecipitate with Abl, and is absent in fission yeast. Several Abl SH3-binding proteins have been identified as candidates for such an inhibitor, including Pag/Msp23 (7Wen S.-T. Van Etten R.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2456-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), AAP1 (30Zhu J. Shore S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7054-7062Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), Abi-1 (31Shi Y. Alin K. Goff S.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2583-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and Abi-2 (32Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Of these inhibitors, Pag/Msp23 has been shown to inhibit c-Abl kinase activity upon co-expression in vivo (7Wen S.-T. Van Etten R.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2456-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To better understand the regulation of c-Abl tyrosine kinase activity, we purified c-Abl in a form that should correspond to its inactive state by using the specific Abl kinase inhibitor STI 571 to prevent activation and autophosphorylation upon overexpression in vivo. We found that unphosphorylated c-Abl had substantial intrinsic catalytic activity relative to inactive c-Src, and this basal activity was further stimulated by autophosphorylation at two distinct regulatory tyrosine residues. Surprisingly, we found that the mutation of the SH3 domain significantly increased the basal activity of c-Abl, supporting an intramolecular regulatory role for SH3. Together, these results suggest a model where c-Abl is activated in vivo by dissociation of an inhibitor followed by phosphorylation at tyrosine residues within the catalytic domain and the SH2-CD linker region. The murine type IV c-abl cDNA in the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was modified to include six histidine codons at the 3′ end. The alteration changed the C-terminal amino acid sequence from …DIVRR to …DIVRRMYPRGNGGGHHHHHH. Abl mutants were generated by inverse polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Abl proteins were expressed by transient transfection of 293T cells as described previously (33DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), except that medium was supplemented with 50 μm STI 571 (Novartis) where indicated. 48–60 h posttransfection, cells were collected and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline only, and then solubilized (1 ml/60-mm plate) in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamide, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and placed on ice for 15 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and then added to cobalt nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Talon resin,CLONTECH) at a ratio of 2 ml of lysate to 200 μl of (packed volume) agarose. Binding reactions were allowed to proceed at 4 °C for approximately 30 min with constant gentle shaking, and then the mixture was transferred to 5-ml disposable chromatography columns. Each column was washed with 1 ml of lysis buffer followed by 0.5 ml of wash buffer I (20 mm Tris, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Brij35, 0.1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors), 0.5 ml of wash buffer II (same as wash buffer I but with 20 mmimidazole), and eluted with 0.5 ml of elution buffer (same as wash buffer I but with 100 mm imidazole). Eluted products were adjusted to 2 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol and then dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Brij35, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. During dialysis, 15 μl of agarose-linked anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Oncogene Science, Inc.) was included to remove residual phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. Dialysates were cleared for 30 min at 13,000 × g and then stored on ice for up to 5 days. The concentration of purified Abl proteins was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and Coomassie Blue staining compared with purified bovine serum albumin standards (Pierce). These were quantitated by densitometry using a digital camera and NIH Image software. The typical yield from two transfected plates was 12–25 μg of total full-length Abl protein at 25–50 ng/μl. Abl phosphorylation reactions were carried out at various kinase concentrations at 30 °C in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEGTA, and 0.01% Brij35) and in 500 μm ATP. For timed autophosphorylation reactions, all additions other than ATP were mixed and preheated for at least 5 min before the addition of ATP. Autophosphorylation reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and boiling. Proteins were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected with anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10, UBI), anti-Abl (3F12, a gift of R. Salgia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute), monoclonal antibodies, and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were digitized by scanning, and relative phosphorylation levels were determined using NIH Image and Origin 5.0 (Microcal) software. Specific activity of unphosphorylated Abl kinases was determined using a peptide substrate containing the preferred Abl substrate sequence (34Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantely L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) and modified with an amino-terminal biotin, biotin-GGEAIYAAPFKK-amide. Kinase assays were carried out at 30 °C in kinase buffer plus 50 μm ATP, [γ-32P]ATP at 5000–7000 cpm/pmol, and peptide substrate. Assays were done in triplicate for each substrate concentration and were allowed to proceed for 5 min before termination by the addition of guanidine hydrochloride to 2.5 m final concentration. After termination, portions of each reaction were spotted onto streptavidin-coated paper discs (SignaTECT,Promega) and then sequentially washed with 2 m NaCl followed by 2 m NaCl with 1% phosphoric acid as suggested by the manufacturer. Phosphate incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the discs. Background binding to the discs was determined by omitting peptide substrate in a series of assays and was usually less than 0.03% total input counts. Incorporated counts for each kinase/substrate combination were averaged, adjusted for background, and plotted on a double-reciprocal (1/V versus 1/[S]) graph using the Origin 5.0 program to calculate K m and V max values. In most assays, the concentration of kinase was 0.01 μm, and specific activity was calculated as picomoles of phosphate incorporated per min per pmol of kinase. To determine the effects of autophosphorylation on kinase specific activity, the two assays detailed above were combined. Autophosphorylation reactions were carried out as described and typically contained unlabeled ATP at 500 μm and kinase at 0.04 μm final concentrations. At indicated times, aliquots of autophosphorylation reactions were withdrawn and terminated for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-Western blot analysis or added to prewarmed mixtures of kinase buffer, [γ-32P]ATP, and peptide substrate. Peptide phosphorylation reactions were done in duplicate or triplicate for 5 min as described above using a single concentration of peptide substrate (100 μm final concentration) to measure activity. Dilution of Abl kinases in the transfer from autophosphorylation reactions to peptide kinase reactions resulted in a final kinase concentration of 0.01 μm in the peptide kinase reactions. Full-length myristoylated (type IV) murine c-Abl proteins containing a C-terminal hexahistidine tag were expressed in 293T cells and purified in a single step by affinity chromatography on Co2+-agarose. c-Abl normally lacks detectable levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo in its inactive state (20Jackson P. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), but high level expression of Abl in mammalian or insect cells results in significant levels of Abl tyrosine phosphorylation (26Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Clark R. McCormick F. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5927-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To isolate unphosphorylated c-Abl, transfected cells were grown in the presence of Novartis STI 571, an Abl-specific kinase inhibitor (35Buchdunger E. Zimmermann J. Mett H. Meyer T. Müller M. Druker B.J. Lydon N.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 100-104PubMed Google Scholar), and any residual tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were removed from purified kinase preparations with agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. c-Abl was the predominant polypeptide in the final preparation by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.1 A) and contained no detectable phosphotyrosine by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1 B). Peptide phosphorylation by the purified wild-type c-Abl was completely STI 571-inhibitable with an IC50 of 0.4 μm (Fig. 1 C), demonstrating that c-Abl was the only detectable tyrosine kinase present in the preparation. To study the in vitrocatalytic activity of purified c-Abl, we employed a sensitive kinase assay using a biotinylated peptide with a sequence preferred by Abl kinases (34Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantely L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Unphosphorylated wild-type c-Abl demonstrated substantial activity toward the peptide substrate with an averageV max of 33 pmol of phosphate min−1and K m of 204 μm (Fig. 1 D). Deletions (20Jackson P. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 22Franz W.M. Berger P. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and some point mutations (23Van Etten R.A. Debnath J. Zhou H. Casasnovas J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1977-1988PubMed Google Scholar) in the c-Abl SH3 domain dysregulate Abl kinase activity in vivo, inducing high levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of Abl and many other proteins and usually causing cellular transformation. However, the in vitro kinase activities of wild-type and SH3-mutated c-Abl are similar when measured after immunoprecipitation (22Franz W.M. Berger P. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Van Etten R.A. Debnath J. Zhou H. Casasnovas J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1977-1988PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that a transforming c-Abl protein containing a point mutation in the SH3 domain (P131L) that disrupts the binding of proline-rich ligands (23Van Etten R.A. Debnath J. Zhou H. Casasnovas J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1977-1988PubMed Google Scholar) exhibited significantly higher catalytic activity than did c-Abl when measured in solution with the peptide substrate. Unphosphorylated c-Abl P131L protein had aV max approximately 3.5 times higher (112 pmol min−1) and a reduced K m (91 μm) relative to wild-type c-Abl (Fig.1 D). A Co2+-agarose affinity-purified preparation from non-transfected cells had only background levels of activity, again confirming that Abl was the sole kinase activity measured in our assay (data not shown). Therefore, the mutation or deletion of the SH3 domain appears to significantly increase the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of unphosphorylated c-Abl. We have also used a physiological protein substrate of c-Abl, GST-Crk (36Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), as a substrate in this assay and observed similar results (data not shown). However, Crk and many other polypeptide substrates of Abl can stably bind to c-Abl and may perturb Abl kinase activity. For this reason, the peptide substrate was employed exclusively in this report. Autophosphorylation leads to increased catalytic activity for many kinases including c-Src (37Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and we tested whether the same was true for c-Abl. Wild-type c-Abl and the P131L mutant were allowed to autophosphorylate, and intrinsic kinase activity was measured with the peptide assay. Both c-Abl and SH3-mutated c-Abl were rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated when incubated in the presence of magnesium ion and ATP (Fig.2 A). Autophosphorylation of c-Src and Hck is concentration-dependent, suggesting an intermolecular reaction mechanism (17Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 37Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 38Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). When the Abl concentration was increased in the autophosphorylation reactions, the minimum time required to detect Abl phosphotyrosine decreased, and the rate of phosphotyrosine accumulation after initial detection increased (Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrate that the c-Abl autophosphorylation rate is dependent on kinase concentration and suggest that autophosphorylation by c-Abl is also an intermolecular event. As autophosphorylation progressed, an increased ability of c-Abl to phosphorylate the peptide substrate was observed (Fig.2 C). Although there was some variability in autophosphorylation-induced activation of c-Abl peptide kinase activity among different Abl preparations, increased peptide kinase activity closely matched the increase in Abl phosphotyrosine content in each experiment. c-Abl catalytic activity toward the peptide substrate continued to increase to as high as 22-fold over the basal level after 60 min of autophosphorylation (Fig. 2 D). The kinase activity of the SH3-mutated c-Abl was also stimulated by autophosphorylation (Fig. 2 C), demonstrating that the SH3 mutation and autophosphorylation act independently to increase the catalytic activity of c-Abl. The activation of c-Abl P131L proceeded somewhat more rapidly than wild-type c-Abl, reaching a maximum after 10 min; however, the increase in activity of c-Abl P131L was only about 3.6-fold (Fig. 2 D). The final activity of tyrosine-phosphorylated wild-type and SH3-mutated c-Abl was very similar (Fig. 2 C) and equal to or greater than the specific activity of c-Abl that was purified from cells without treatment with STI 571 (data not shown). These results suggest that c-Abl is capable of maximal activation under these conditions and that autophosphorylation of c-Abl ultimately overcomes the intrinsic inhibitory effect of the SH3 domain. Tyrosine 412 within the catalytic lobe of the c-Abl kinase domain is homologous to c-Src tyrosine 416, and autophosphorylation at tyrosine 416 has been shown to stimulate the kinase activity of Src kinases (19Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2721-2726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 37Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Tyrosine 412 is known to be a major site of tyrosine phosphorylation in transforming Abl proteins (39Reynolds F.H. Oroszlan S. Stephenson J.R. J. Virol. 1982; 44: 1097-1101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A c-Abl Y412F mutant accumulated little phosphotyrosine upon high level expression in 293T cells in the absence of STI 571 (Fig.3 A), confirming that Tyr-412 is a major in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation site of c-Abl. Whereas mutation of the Tyr-416 homologue in Hck to alanine partially activates kinase activity (19Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2721-2726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), unphosphorylated c-Abl Y412F displayed similar peptide kinase kinetics as wild-type c-Abl (Fig.3 B), demonstrating that mutation of tyrosine 412 to phenylalanine did not significantly alter the basal catalytic activity of Abl. c-Abl Y412F was able to autophosphorylate upon incubation with magnesium and ATP (Fig. 3 C), but the amount of phosphotyrosine was reduced in comparison with wild-type c-Abl, and phosphorylation was maximal by 20 min. Autophosphorylation of c-Abl Y412F was accompanied by increased peptide kinase activity, but the increase was very modest, peaking at a maximum of 4-fold activation 5 min after the addition of ATP (Fig. 3 D). Peptide kinase activity then dropped slightly and remained steady for the next 60 min, very similar to the kinetics of autophosphorylation (Fig.3 C). These results demonstrate that Tyr-412 is required for most of the stimulatory effect of autophosphorylation on Abl catalytic activity and suggest that, as for c-Src, phosphorylation of this activatio"

https://openalex.org/W2160567919,"Metaphase chromosome alignment is a key step of animal cell mitosis. The molecular mechanism leading to this equatorial positioning is still not fully understood. Forces exerted at kinetochores and on chromosome arms drive chromosome movements that culminate in their alignment on the metaphase plate. In this paper, we show that Xkid, a kinesin-like protein localized on chromosome arms, plays an essential role in metaphase chromosome alignment and in its maintenance. We propose that Xkid is responsible for the polar ejection forces acting on chromosome arms. Our results show that these forces are essential to ensure that kinetochores and chromosome arms align on a narrow equatorial plate during metaphase, a prerequisite for proper chromosome segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2028407058,"The macrophage fusion receptor (MFR), also called P84/BIT/SIRPα/SHPS-1, is a transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the superfamily of immunoglobulins. Previously, we showed that MFR expression is highly induced at the onset of fusion in macrophages, and that MFR appears to play a role in macrophage-macrophage adhesion/fusion leading to multinucleation. The recent finding that IAP/CD47 acts as a ligand for MFR led us to hypothesize that it interacts with CD47 at the onset of cell-cell fusion. CD47 is a transmembrane glycoprotein, which, like MFR, belongs to the superfamily of immunoglobulins. We show that macrophages express the hemopoietic form of CD47, the expression of which is induced at the onset of fusion, but to a lower level than MFR. A glutathioneS-transferase CD47 fusion protein engineered to contain the extracellular domain of CD47, binds macrophages, associates with MFR, and prevents multinucleation. CD47 and MFR associate via their amino-terminal immunoglobulin variable domain. Of the nine monoclonal antibodies raised against the extracellular domain of CD47, three block fusion, as well as MFR-CD47 interaction, whereas the others have no effect.

Although osteoclasts and giant cells play an important role in bone remodeling and immune defense, respectively, they are also associated with osteoporosis, granulomatous diseases, and tumors. Multinucleation appears to endow macrophages with the capacity to digest and resorb extracellular infectious agents, foreign material, and other components that are too large to be internalized, such as bone. This resorption occurs in an “extracellular lysosomal compartment” sealed off between the multinucleated cell and its target substrate (reviewed in Ref. 1Baron R. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 266: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane that faces that extracellular domain is highly ruffled and specialized. Multinucleation gives macrophages added resorptive capacity, in part by making available a large excess of plasma membrane. Understanding the mechanism by which macrophages differentiate into osteoclasts and multinucleated giant cells is of extreme importance. One of the key steps in the differentiation of osteoclasts and giant cells is the fusion mechanism of their mononucleated precursor cells. It is assumed that both osteoclasts and giant cells originate from the fusion of mononuclear phagocytes. Despite the pathophysiological importance of these cells, the mechanism by which their mononucleated precursors fuse remains poorly understood. Indeed, cell-cell fusion itself, whether it concerns that of sperm cells with oocytes in fertilization or myoblasts with myoblasts in muscle development, has not been investigated thoroughly. It is proposed that cell-cell fusion involves a set of proteins similar to those used by viruses to fuse with host cells before injecting their DNA or RNA (2Hernandez L. Hoffman L. Wolfsberg T. White J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 627-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that viruses have usurped the fusion protein machinery from their target cells. It is now well accepted that virus-cell fusion requires both an attachment mechanism and a fusogenic peptide. One such example is human immunodeficiency virus attachment, where gp120 binds CD4 on T lymphocytes and macrophages (3Dalgleish A.G. Beverly P. Clapham P. Crawford D. Greaves M. Weiss R. Nature. 1984; 312: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (2585) Google Scholar, 4Klatzmann D. Champagne E. Chamaret S. Grust J. Guetard D. Hercent T. Gluckmann J.C. Montagnier L. Nature. 1984; 312: 767-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar), whereas the fusion molecule gp40 triggers the actual fusion event. Although putative fusion molecules mediating sperm-oocyte and myoblast fusion have been reported (5Blobel C. Wolfsberg T. Turck C. Myles D. Primakoff P. White J. Nature. 1992; 356: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 6Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A.

Science. 2000; 287: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), the actual protein machinery governing the attachment and fusion of these cells remains unknown. To investigate the mechanism of homotypic mononuclear phagocyte fusion leading to the differentiation of osteoclasts and giant cells, our hypothesis has been that macrophage-macrophage fusion, similar to virus-cell fusion, depends on the expression of specific cell surface proteins. To identify such proteins, we had established an in vitro macrophage fusion assay as a model system. When cultured under fusogenic conditions, rat alveolar macrophages rapidly generate large polykaryons whose non-adherent plasma membrane is enriched in sodium pumps while the opposite plasma membrane facing the substrate is enriched in proton pumps (9Vignery A. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 565-570PubMed Google Scholar, 10Vignery A. Niven-Fairchild T. Ingbar D. Caplan M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1265-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This is a property that is shared with osteoclasts (reviewed in Ref. 1Baron R. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 266: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using these fusing macrophages as immunogen, we previously generated four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)1 that block fusion. All four mAbs recognize the same antigen, the macrophage fusion receptor (MFR), which is highly and transiently induced at the onset of fusion (11Saginario C. Qian H.-Y. Vignery A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12210-12214Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Saginario C. Sterling H. Beckers C. Kobayashi R.-J. Solimena M. Ullu E. Vignery A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6213-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). MFR was cloned simultaneously by several groups as P84/BIT/SIRPα/SHPS-1 (13Sano S. Ohnishi H. Omori A. Hasegawa J. Kubota M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A.

Biol. 1997; 16: 6887-6899Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar). MFR is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the superfamily of immunoglobulins (Ig) (12Saginario C. Sterling H. Beckers C. Kobayashi R.-J. Solimena M. Ullu E. Vignery A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6213-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). MFR contains three Ig domains in its extracellular partand closely resembles CD4. The intracellular domain of MFR associates with the phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, hence its name, SHPS-1 (15Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamaom T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 16: 6887-6899Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We reported that the recombinant extracellular domain of MFR engineered as a GST fusion protein blocks fusion by specifically binding to fusing macrophages (12Saginario C. Sterling H. Beckers C. Kobayashi R.-J. Solimena M. Ullu E. Vignery A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6213-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), suggesting that MFR interacts with a putative ligand expressed on the surface of fusing macrophages. Jiang et al.(16Jiang P. Lagenaur C.F. Narayanan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) recently reported that IAP/CD47 is a ligand for P84/BIT known to promote neurite outgrowth (17Chuang W. Lagenaur C.F. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), suggesting that CD47 might be the relevant MFR ligand in macrophage fusion. Seiffert et al.(18Seiffert M. Cant C. Chen Z. Rappold I. Brugger W. Kanz L. Brown E. Ullrich A. Buhring H.-J. Blood. 1999; 94: 3633-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that CD47 is a counterreceptor for human SIRPα1. CD47 is a widely expressed 50-kDa protein that belongs to the superfamily of immunoglobulins and was initially identified through co-purification with the integrin αvβ3 from human placenta (19Brown E. Hooper L. Ho T. Gresham H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) prior to being shown to be CD47 (20Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 21Mawby W.J. Holmes C.H. Anstee D.J. Spring F.A. Tanner M.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). CD47 comprises an extracellular immunoglobulin variable domain and five transmembrane domains with its COOH-terminal domain located intracellularly. Its intracellular COOH-terminal domain exists in four alternatively spliced forms (22Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Plas D. Reynolds S. Peters M.G. Brown E.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3419-3425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that if macrophages express CD47, this molecule might interact with MFR and participate in macrophage adhesion/fusion leading to multinucleation. We present evidence that: (i) fusing macrophages express the hemopoietic form of CD47, (ii) a fusion protein engineered to contain the extracellular domain of CD47 blocks fusion, (iii) three out of nine mAbs directed against the extracellular domain of CD47 block both MFR-CD47 interaction and fusion, and (iv) CD47 and MFR interact via their immunoglobulin variable domain in fusing macrophages. Together, these data suggest that CD47 belongs to the protein machinery that mediates macrophage adhesion/fusion leading to multinucleation. Rat alveolar macrophages were obtained from 12-week-old Fisher 344 rats (Charles River, Kingston, NY) by tracheobronchial lavage and cultured in fusogenic conditions as described previously (9Vignery A. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 565-570PubMed Google Scholar, 10Vignery A. Niven-Fairchild T. Ingbar D. Caplan M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1265-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were plated at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml in MEME supplemented with 10% human serum, and then, once adherent, cultured in 5% human serum. Mouse anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing IAP-deficient mice with purified human placental CD47 (19Brown E. Hooper L. Ho T. Gresham H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), fusing spleen cells with the non-secreting myeloma P3 × 63Ag8.653 (ATCC), and screening clones for reactivity with human and murine CD47. The antibodies are miap 400 (IgG2b), 410 (IgG1), 420 (IgG2a), 430 (IgG2a), 440 (IgG1), 450 (IgG2a), 460 (IgG1), 470 (IgG2a), and 480 (IgG1). mAbs were conjugated to NHS-LC biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mouse anti-rat MFR (mAb 10C4) was published previously (11Saginario C. Qian H.-Y. Vignery A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12210-12214Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-SIRPα and SHP-1 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Streptavidin-biotin complex-horseradish peroxidase (HRP-ABC) conjugate was purchased from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). Mouse mAbs anti-rat MHCII (RT1B), which is of the IgG1 isotype; mouse IgG1; and biotin-conjugated mouse anti-GST were obtained from Serotec (Raleigh, NC). Lissamine-rhodamine-conjugated F(ab′)2 donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L chains), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L chains), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L chains), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated and affinity-purified rat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG (H+L chains) were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc. (West Grove, PA). Goat anti-GST and rabbit anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Cells were cultured in Lab-Tek (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) glass chamber slides for the indicated time in MEME containing 5% human serum, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and washed for 60 min in PBS-milk (PBS with 5% nonfat dry milk). The cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in PBS-milk supplemented with mouse anti-CD47 mAbs (2 μg/ml), mAb 10C4 (cell culture supernatant, 1:100), or control mouse IgG2a (2 μg/ml). Following four washes of 15 min each in PBS-milk, the cells were incubated for an additional 1 h with lissamine-rhodamine-conjugated F(ab)′2 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution) in the same buffer. The cells were mounted in PBS:glycerol (1:1 v/v) supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma). The cells were imaged at 570 and 350 nm using the lissamine rhodamine sulfonyl chloride and DAPI excitation filters, respectively, on an Olympus microscope equipped with UV light. Total RNA was isolated from rat alveolar macrophages cultured in fusogenic conditions for the indicated times. RNA was extracted using a modification of the methods described by Glisin et al. (23Glisin V. Crkvenjakov R. Byus C. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2633-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar) and Ullrich et al. (24Ullrich A. Shine J. Chirgwin J. Pictet R. Tischer E. Rutler W.J. Goodman H. Science. 1977; 196: 1313-131925Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) or the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). In each case guanidinium thiocyanate homogenization buffer was added to the freshly isolated and cultured cells after rapid removal of culture medium. The cell lysates were sheared using a syringe with a 20-gauge needle (Beckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For separation by cesium chloride, 2.5-ml aliquots of the lysate were layered onto a 2-ml cushion of 5.7 mcesium chloride (American Bioanalytical, Natik, NJ) in RNase-free 5.1-ml polyallomer centrifuge tubes, which were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 h using a Ti 55 SW rotor. The supernatants were aspirated and the pellets dissolved in TE (pH 7.6) containing 0.1% SDS by freezing and thawing the samples twice and then warming to 45 °C. RNA was precipitated by the addition of 0.3m sodium acetate and three volumes of ethanol. The pellets were resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and the concentration determined using optical density measurements taken in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences UV-visible spectrophotometer (Foster City, CA). First strand cDNA was synthesized as follows; 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a 20-μl reaction primed with oligo(dT)15 primer (Promega, Springfield, NJ). The protocol followed was that published in the instruction manual from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The cDNA was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. For PCR reaction, 1 μl of cDNA was used as template in a 25-μl reaction mix containing 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences), 1.25 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm dNTP mix (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The buffer condition used for the PCR was a 1-fold dilution of the 10-fold mix provided with the polymerase. The sequences of the primer pairs (used at a concentration of 0.1 μg/reaction) were as follows: full-length CD47, primer forward (nt 24–40, 5′-AGATGTGGCCCTTGGCG-3′) and reverse primer (nt 978–996, 5′-TGCTCAGACAACTGTATTC-3′). The cycle parameters were, 3 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles. The PCR fragment was gel-purified using Geneclean (Bio 101 Inc., Branford, CT) and cloned into PCR II TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The cloned DNA insert was sequenced (W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University, New Haven, CT) using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase and fluorescent dideoxy terminators (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a cycle sequencing method. The resulting DNA fragments were gel-purified and analyzed using an automated Applied Biosystems 373A stretch or 377 DNA sequencer. MFR, CD47, and MHCII cell surface expression was quantitated by ELISA as follows; 5 × 104 alveolar macrophages/well plated at 5 × 106 cells/ml in 96-well plates were cultured for the indicated times. The minimum culture time after plating in each experiment was 1 h in order to secure the adherence of the cells to the wells. The cells were fixed at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated in 100 μl of PBS supplemented with 5% dry milk (PBS-milk) for 2 h. The cells were subsequently incubated overnight with mAb 10C4 (cell culture supernatant), mAb anti-CD47 (miaps, 10 μg/ml), or anti-rat MHCII (10–50 μg/ml). Following three washes of 10 min each with PBS, the cells were incubated at room temperature for 2 h in PBS-milk supplemented with goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:5000 dilution). The cells were washed three times with PBS for 10 min each. Antibody binding was quantitated by incubating the cells for five min in 100 μl of 3,3′5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (HRP substrate, Moss Inc., Pasadena, MD). Optical density (OD650) measurements were made using a kinetic reader (Menlo Park, CA). Rat alveolar macrophages were harvested by lavage, plated in six-well plates at 5 × 106 cells/ml, cultured in MEME supplemented with 5% HS for 2 days, and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (9Vignery A. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 565-570PubMed Google Scholar, 10Vignery A. Niven-Fairchild T. Ingbar D. Caplan M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1265-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and to pull-down as follows. In brief, cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, each at 10 μg/ml; 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, one tablet of CompleteTM (Roche Molecular Bioochemicals)), 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride. For immunoprecipitation, the post-nuclear supernatants were pre-incubated with mouse IgG1 or non-immune rabbit serum for 1 h, then with protein G-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) (1 μg/ml) for 30 min. The lysates were then incubated with miaps or rabbit anti-MFR for 1 h, followed by protein G-agarose for 30 min. For “pull-down” experiments, the post-nuclear supernatants were pre-incubated with GST that was coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min and then incubated with GST-CD47e or GST-MFRev coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates and the pull-downs were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under non-reducing conditions followed by Western blot analysis using mAb 10C4 and miap 460-biotin, then HRP-rat anti-mouse F(ab′)2 and HRP-ABC, respectively. Alveolar macrophage lysates, immunoprecipitates, and pull-downs were subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in reducing or non-reducing conditions. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) by electroblotting for 90 min at 4 °C. The membranes were subsequently incubated in PBS supplemented with 5% dry milk overnight at 4 °C, washed in PBS supplemented with Tween 20 (1%), and incubated with mAb 10C4, miap 460-biotin, anti-MFR, or anti-SHP-1 for 1 h at room temperature, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse, HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig, or HRP-ABC, accordingly, for 30 min at room temperature. The HRP activity was determined using ECL (Amersham ECL kit). The enzyme reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and the blots exposed to x-ray films. MFRev was expressed as a GST fusion protein using PGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PCR amplification of the extracellular domain of MFR was performed using a sense primer that lacked the MFR leader sequence (5′-TGTTTCTGTGCAGAATTCAGCGGGAAAGAACTGAAG; nt 114–150) and an antisense primer (5′-ACCCACACCGATGAATTCCTTCCAGTTGTAAGC; nt 1145–1181) that did not include the transmembrane domain of MFR as described previously (12Saginario C. Sterling H. Beckers C. Kobayashi R.-J. Solimena M. Ullu E. Vignery A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6213-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The PCR reaction utilized Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and full-length MFR cDNA clone 2.1, which lacks the two extracellular C1 loops, as the template. That clone had been previously isolated from our fusing macrophage cDNA library and sequenced (Ref. 12Saginario C. Sterling H. Beckers C. Kobayashi R.-J. Solimena M. Ullu E. Vignery A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6213-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, and data not shown). Both primers were designed to contain EcoRI sites. The amplified PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and inserted in frame into theEcoRI site of pGEX-4T-1. The resulting construct was used to transform the protease-deficient E. coli strain BL-21. GST-MFRev was isolated from 2 liters of bacterial culture using the bulk GST purification modules as described by the manufacturer's recommendations. The eluted protein was extensively dialyzed against PBS. Recombinant GST-MFRev ran as a fusion protein of approximately 39 kDa. Its concentration was determined by running a 5-μl aliquot on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For protein concentration determination, the intensity of the stained band was tested against that of a serial dilution of bovine serum albumin run on the same gel. All steps for production of the protein were as described above for GST-MFRe (12Saginario C. Sterling H. Beckers C. Kobayashi R.-J. Solimena M. Ullu E. Vignery A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6213-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The recombinant extracellular domain of CD47 (CD47e) was expressed as a fusion protein using the GST fusion protein system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PCR amplification of this region was performed with a forward primer (nt 80–100, 5′-TCGTCGTCGGGTGGATCCCAACTCCTGCTTAGTAAAGTC) and a reverse primer (nt 425–445, 3′-GCGACCATGGCAGCGGCCGCCTTTTCATTTGTAGAAAACCA, using fusing rat macrophage cDNA as template (made from total RNA) andPwo as polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The primers were designed to allow digestion of the resulting PCR fragment with BamHI and NotI, by means of which it was ligated in frame into a BamHI-NotI-cut pGEX-4T-1 vector. The resulting construct encoded a fusion protein of approximately 40 kDa and was used to transform the protease-deficientEscherichia coli strain BL-21. Soluble GST-CD47e was isolated from 2 liters of bacterial culture using the bulk GST purification module as described by the manufacturer. The eluted protein was extensively dialyzed against PBS and stored at −70 °C until ready for use. Recombinant GST-CD47e was quantified in the same way as GST-MFRev. Fusion proteins were stored in lipopolysaccharide-free water as 1 mg/ml stock solutions, diluted in MEME, and filter-sterilized before use. Aliquots (10 μl) of 5 × 106 rat alveolar macrophages/ml were plated in quadruplicate using 96-well tissue culture plates, cultured in MEME with 5% human serum supplemented or not with recombinant proteins (GST-CD47e, GST-MFRev, and GST) (1–50 nm). The cells were examined daily for 4 days, and fusion was graded blindly by three investigators on a scale of 1 (absence of fusion) to 5 (fusion greater than 90%), as described previously (12Saginario C. Sterling H. Beckers C. Kobayashi R.-J. Solimena M. Ullu E. Vignery A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6213-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated rat alveolar macrophages were plated at 5 × 106 cells/ml in quadruplicate using 96-well plates (105 cells/well). The cells were cultured for 24 h in MEME plus 5% human serum, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and blocked with PBS plus 5% milk. The cells were supplemented with GST-CD47e at the indicated concentrations. Binding proceeded overnight at 4 °C. For dissociation studies, the medium was replaced with fresh medium lacking recombinant protein to allow for dissociation. Dissociation proceeded at 4 °C for the indicated times. The media from all wells were then removed, and the cells were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. Following washes and blocking in PBS plus 5% milk, the cells were incubated with mouse anti-GST conjugated to either biotin or HRP (2 μg/ml) for 30 min, followed by HRP-ABC for 30 min at 4 °C for biotin-anti-GST. HRP was reacted by adding 100 μl of peroxidase substrate (TMB, Moss Inc, Pasadena, MD) to each well and the optical density was read at 650 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For specific binding studies, cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of GST-CD47e or GST overnight at 4 °C. For competition binding studies, cells were preincubated with increasing concentrations of either mAb 10C4 or miaps for 1 h at 4 °C, then supplemented with either GST-CD47e or GST-MFRev (20 nm) overnight, respectively. Cells were subsequently reacted as described above to detect GST fusion protein binding. Data are expressed as mean ± 1 standard deviation. Comparative analyses of the means were performed with appropriate controls using independent Student's ttest to determine the 99% confidence level (p < 0.01). To investigate whether fusing macrophages express CD47, rat alveolar macrophages were plated in glass chamber slides and cultured under fusogenic conditions. Under these conditions, 90–95% of the cells fuse within 4–5 days into multinucleate giant cells that contain hundreds of nuclei each. This is shown in Fig. 1 A, where multinucleated cells were reacted with lissamine-rhodamine-conjugated antibodies (red fluorescence, left panels), as well as with the nuclear stain DAPI (light blue dots, center panels), and visualized with Hoffman modulation contrast (right panels). Fusing cells were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence using a panel of nine anti-CD47 mouse mAbs that we generated by immunizing CD47-deficient mice with the extracellular domain of human CD47 (miaps, see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1 A(left panels), intact fusing mononucleated macrophages reacted strongly with both miap 410 and miap 450. In contrast, the signal detected on most of the plasma membrane of multinucleated cells appeared diffuse, and less intense. Of importance, each anti-CD47 mAb miap gave similar results (data not shown), whereas isotype-matched controls gave no signal (Fig. 1 A, and data not shown). The localization of CD47 appeared similar to that of mAb 10C4, which recognizes MFR (Fig. 1 A), and concentrated on the plasma membrane of fusing mononucleated macrophages. Once multinucleated, macrophages appeared to express a lesser amount of CD47. This is a pattern of expression similar to that of MFR (11Saginario C. Qian H.-Y. Vignery A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12210-12214Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To determine whether the cell surface expression of CD47, like MFR, was altered by multinucleation, fusing macrophages were subjected to ELISA at different time points after plating. As shown previously, the expression of MFR is highly induced at the onset of multinucleation,i.e. 24 h after plating, and decreases thereafter with multinucleation (12Saginario C. Sterling H.

https://openalex.org/W2045415864,"Methionine oxidation into methionine sulfoxide is known to be involved in many pathologies and to exert regulatory effects on proteins. This oxidation can be reversed by a ubiquitous monomeric enzyme, the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrA), whose activity in vivo requires the thioredoxin-regenerating system. The proposed chemical mechanism ofEscherichia coli MsrA involves three Cys residues (positions 51, 198, and 206). A fourth Cys (position 86) is not important for catalysis. In the absence of a reducing system, 2 mol of methionine are formed per mole of enzyme for wild type and Cys-86 → Ser mutant MsrA, whereas only 1 mol is formed for mutants in which either Cys-198 or Cys-206 is mutated. Reduction of methionine sulfoxide is shown to proceed through the formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate. This intermediate has been characterized by chemical probes and mass spectrometry analyses. Together, the results support a three-step chemical mechanism in vivo: 1) Cys-51 attacks the sulfur atom of the sulfoxide substrate leading, via a rearrangement, to the formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate on Cys-51 and release of 1 mol of methionine/mol of enzyme; 2) the sulfenic acid is then reduced via a double displacement mechanism involving formation of a disulfide bond between Cys-51 and Cys-198, followed by formation of a disulfide bond between Cys-198 and Cys-206, which liberates Cys-51, and 3) the disulfide bond between Cys-198 and Cys-206 is reduced by thioredoxin-dependent recycling system process.

These species can react with various targets including proteins. In particular, methionine residues can be oxidized into methionine sulfoxide (MetSO).1 Such modifications can alter the biological properties of the targeted proteins (1Vogt W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). For instance, this likely is the case for the α-proteinase inhibitor whose oxidation of a methionine residue decreases its affinity relative to its protease target (2Abrams W.R. Weinbaum G. Weissbach L. Weissbach H. Brot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7483-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and also for calmodulin whose methionine oxidation leads to a decrease in the efficiency of activation of plasma membrane (3Sun H. Gao J. Ferrington D.A. Biesada H. Williams T.D. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). On the other hand the fact that methionine modifications can be also restricted to only surface-exposed residues was interpreted as a way to protect cells against the action of reactive oxygen species (4Levine R.L. Mosoni L. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15036-15040Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). In vivo a ubiquitous enzyme named peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrA) exists, which reduces both free and protein bound MetSO (5Moskovitz J. Rahman M.A. Strassman J. Yancey S.O. Kushner S.R. Brot N. Weissbach H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 6Moskovitz J. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jursky F. Weissbach H. Brot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3205-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The fact that the null mutants of bothEscherichia coli and yeast showed increased sensitivity against oxidative damage and that overexpression of MsrA gave higher resistance to hydrogen treatment supports an essential role of MsrA in cell viability (7Moskovitz J. Berlett B.S. Poston J.M. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 8Moskovitz J. Flescher E. Berlett B.S. Azare J. Poston J.M.

Thus the important biological role attributed to MsrA in vivo justifies a study of the chemical mechanism of the reduction of MetSO by MsrA. The fact that MsrA activity necessitates a thioredoxin recycling system (9Russel M. Model P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14997-15005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mössner E.

Recently, two groups have shown that mutating the invariant cysteine located in the conserved signature Gly-Cys-Phe-Trp resulted in total loss of enzyme activity (12Moskovitz J. Poston J.M.

Based on their data they formulated a reaction mechanism requiring formation of a covalent tetracoordinate intermediate via a nucleophilic attack by the thiolate of the essential cysteine followed by breakdown of the intermediate by means of two thiol-disulfide exchanges, which leads to release of a methionine and a water molecule. In this mechanism, methionine release only occurs if the disulfide exchange is operative. In the present study we show that in fact the nucleophilic attack of the essential cysteine on MetSO leads to formation of a sulfenic acid enzyme intermediate with a concomitant release of methionine. Return of the active site to a reduced state is achieved in vivo via intra-disulfide exchange reactions involving two other cysteines and then by a thioredoxin-dependent recycling process. The E. coli strain used for wild type and mutant MsrAs production was DH5α (supE44, ΔlacU169 (φ80 lacZΔM15), hsdR17, recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi-1, relA1) transformed with a plasmid construction containing themsrA gene under the control of the lac promoter. Site-directed mutageneses were performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For purification of wild type and mutant MsrAs, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in minimal volume of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8) containing 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and sonicated. The MsrA was then precipitated at 45% ammonium sulfate saturation. The contaminating proteins were removed by applying the enzymatic solution onto exclusion size chromatography on ACA 54 gel (IBF) at pH 8 (buffer A). Purified fractions were then pooled and applied to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A, followed by a linear gradient of KCl (0–0.4 m) using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The MsrA was eluted at 250 mm KCl. At this stage, wild type and mutant MsrAs were pure as checked by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. Briefly, 10 μg of enzyme was mixed with sample loading buffer (62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue) with and without DTT (100 mm), and samples were analyzed without heating. Purified enzymes were stored at −20 °C in the presence of 20 mm DTT and 45% ammonium sulfate. Under these conditions, the enzymes were stable for several weeks. Their molar concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, using a molar absorptivity at 280 nm of 34632 m−1 cm−1, deduced from the method of Scopes (15Scopes R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), for wild type and mutant MsrAs. Native molecular mass determination was performed by gel filtration using a Superose 12 H.R. (10 × 30) fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)equilibrated with buffer A containing 150 mm KCl, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. For calibration, the following molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad) were used: vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa), myoglobin (horse, 17.5 kDa), ovalbumin (chicken, 44 kDa), γ-globulin (beef, 158 kDa), and tyroglobulin (670 kDa). The void and total volumes of the column, 6.9 and 18.2 ml, respectively, were determined with potassium bichromate and blue dextran dyes to enable calculation of the distribution coefficient KAV. The triple mutant C86S/C198S/C206S was incubated with 1 equivalent of H2O2 at room temperature for 30 min in buffer A. The evolution of the oxidation was followed by quantification of the remaining Cys-51 content with 5, 5′-dithiobis(2-nitro)benzoate (DTNB). Cysteine content of protein samples was determined using DTNB under nondenaturing and denaturing conditions, either after treatment or no treatment with 10 mm MetSO but without the addition of any exogenous reducing system. Progress curves of thionitrobenzoate (TNB−) production for wild type and mutant enzymes were recorded at 412 nm in buffer A for nondenaturing conditions. For denaturing conditions, SDS was added to a final concentration of 10% and enzyme solution was heated 10 min at 25 or 70 °C. Enzyme concentrations were 7.35 and 14.7 μm, and DTNB concentration was 300 μm. The amount of TNB− formed was calculated using an extinction coefficient at 412 nm of 13600 m−1cm−1. The ability of wild type and mutant MsrAs to reduce free MetSO was assayed by usingd,l-MetSO as a substrate and either 10 mm DTT or a thioredoxin-regenerating system (10 μm Chlamydomonas reinhardtiithioredoxin, 0.64 μm Arabidopsis thalianathioredoxin reductase, and 0.2 mm NADPH). The reaction mixture contained 10 mm MetSO in buffer A and various concentrations (1–20 μm) of pure wild type or mutant MsrAs. Thioredoxin from C. reinhardtii and thioredoxin reductase from A. thaliana were prepared in the laboratory of Dr. J. P. Jacquot following experimental procedures already published (16Stein M. Jacquot J.P. Jeanette E. Decottignies P. Hodges M. Lancelin J.M. Mittard V. Schmitter J.M. Miginiac-Maslow M. Plant Mol.

Biol. 1994; 235: 1357-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The E. coli recycling system was provided by Dr. J. P. Jacquot. Initial rate measurements were carried out by following at 25 °C the appearance of free methionine measured by high pressure liquid chromatography. For that, aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed at different times of incubation up to 2.5 min, and reaction was stopped by addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1%. A 100-μl sample of these aliquots was injected onto a 25-cm Sephasil C18 reverse phase column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on anÄKTA explorer system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with H2O/trifluoroacetic acid 0.1% buffer in the presence of 10% acetonitrile. Met was eluted isocraticaly after MetSO as monitored by peak integration at 215 nm (1 nmol of Met gives 2.66 area units). The reaction mixture containing 10 mm MetSO and 100–500 μm of enzyme was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8 buffer. Then, 100 μl of the reaction mixture was injected onto a Sephasil C18 column for Met quantification as described above. Sulfenic acid intermediate was characterized using TNB− under nondenaturing conditions. TNB− was prepared by reducing the corresponding disulfide using the procedure of Silver (18Silver M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 62: 135-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Progress curves of TNB− disappearance for wild type and mutant enzymes were recorded at 412 nm in buffer A. Enzyme concentrations were 7.35 and 14.7 μm, and TNB− concentration was 60 μm. The amount of TNB− consumed was calculated using a molar absorptivity at 412 nm of 13600 m−1 cm−1. Analyses were performed for wild type and mutant MsrAs, either after treatment or without treatment with MetSO and/or 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione (dimedone). All the modification reactions were performed in buffer A in the presence of 20 μm of enzyme. 10 mm of MetSO was added, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min. The reactions with dimedone were carried out by addition of 200 μm dimedone before or after reaction with MetSO. Proteins to be subjected to mass spectrometry analysis were purified and desalted on an anionic exchange column (Resource Q; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 0.05 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.7, and eluted with a linear gradient (0–0.4m) of ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.7. A major peak contaminated by a minor peak was observed. This latter peak corresponded to higher order oligomers formed most likely because of the high concentration of the protein samples. Only the major fraction, which corresponded to the monomeric form, was collected and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometric measurements were performed on a VG-Bio Q triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass), upgraded so that the electrospray ionization source has Quattro II performances. In all this work, ions were produced in the positive ion mode and were detected at the exit of the first analyzer for measurements in denaturing conditions and at the exit of the second analyzer for analysis in nondenaturing conditions. Mass data were recorded either from the denaturated protein or from the protein prepared under near physiological conditions. For measurements in denaturing conditions, MsrA samples were diluted to 10 μm in a 1:1 water-acetonitrile mixture (v/v) containing 1% formic acid. Samples were introduced into the ion source via a 10-μl syringe loading injector, and spectra were acquired fromm/z 500 to 2000. This provided good accuracy and sensitivity of the electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry measurements. To investigate the oligomerization state or the metal binding properties of MsrAs, the proteins were mass analyzed in nondenaturing conditions. Therefore, samples were diluted to 10 μm in ammonium acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 7). The samples were continuously infused into the ion source at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, and mass data were recorded fromm/z 1000 to 6000. MsrA-encoded proteins were overexpressed in E. colistrain. Over 30% of the soluble proteins in the supernatant were MsrA. The molecular mass of 23185 ± 1 Da determined by mass spectrometry for the wild type was in good agreement with the 23,185 Da predicted from the MsrA DNA sequence (19Rahman M.A. Nelson H. Weissbach H. Brot N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15549-15551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), assuming the cleavage of the N-terminal Met residue. The elution profile of MsrAs on gel filtration under native conditions was in agreement with a monomeric state. Mass spectrometry analysis under nondenaturing conditions revealed the presence of the MsrAs in their monomeric state (data not shown). Comparison of the mass obtained under denaturing and nondenaturing conditions indicates the absence of tightly bound metal ion. DTNB reagent revealed four cysteines under denaturing conditions. This result was expected from the MsrA DNA sequence that indicates four cysteines at positions 51, 86, 198, and 206. 2The numbering of the amino acids is based on theE. coli MsrA proteic sequence, i.e. without the N-terminal Met residue. Under native conditions, all four cysteines were also reactive. To evaluate their role in the catalysis, the four cysteines were mutated into Ser, individually or in a series of permutations (TableI). The mutation of the invariant Cys-51 abolished all activity, whereas no significant effect was observed for the C86S mutant. This latter result excluded any role of Cys-86 in the catalysis. Site-directed mutations of Cys-198 or Cys-206 led to mutants, which presented significant activity in the DTT-based assay. The double mutants C86S/C198S and C86S/C206S showed activities higher than those of the corresponding single mutants C198S and C206S. These unexpected results remain to be explained but are not related to formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds (see “Intermolecular Disulfide Bonds Formed upon MetSO Treatment”). In contrast, no turnover activity was observed in thioredoxin-based assay with C. reinhardtii thioredoxin and A. thaliana thioredoxin reductase. Similar results were obtained with E. colithioredoxin recycling system (data not shown). Thus, this excluded any bias in interpreting the results because of the use of heterologous thiol recycling system. The triple mutant C86S/C198S/C206S was also shown to be only active with DTT. Moreover, the triple mutant oxidized on Cys-51 by one equivalent of H2O2 showed catalytic properties similar to those of the nontreated mutant (data not shown).Table IThe enzymatic activity of wild type and Cys to Ser mutants of E. coli MsrAEnzymeActivityWith DTTWith thioredoxin system%Wild type100100C51SND 1-aIncreasing the enzyme concentration up to 100 μm and the reaction time up to 25 min for the C51S mutant with DDT or thioredoxin-regenerating system gave an activity that was 0.05% of the wild type enzyme.

ND, not detectable with the conditions used (<0.2%). To further investigate the catalytic mechanism, the free thiol content of each mutant was determined with DTNB before and after incubation with MetSO but in the absence of reducing agent. Under native and denaturing conditions, the results were similar (TableII). This result indicates that loss of free thiol in native proteins is not the consequence of lack of accessibility. In particular, about three thiol groups for wild type and C86S mutant were lost upon treatment with MetSO, whereas none and about one and two thiol groups were lost for C51S, C198S, and C206S mutants, respectively. The situation for the double mutants C86S/C198S and C86S/C206S was less clear because of lack of reproducibility of the measurement of the thiol content. The reason of this inaccuracy remains to be explained. It is also important to note that the triple mutant C86S/C198S/C206S revealed no free thiol. The same results were obtained for this triple mutant treated with a stoichiometric amount of H2O2.Table IIFree sulfhydryl content of wild type and Cys to Ser mutants of E. coli MsrAEnzymeNo. of CysNo. of CysNondenaturing conditionsDenaturing conditionsWithout MetSOWith MetSODecrease in free thiols 2-aThe difference in the number of free cysteine thiols upon treatment withd,l-MetSO versus no treatment.Without MetSOWith MetSODecrease in free thiols 2-aThe difference in the number of free cysteine thiols upon treatment withd,l-MetSO versus no treatment.Calculated from the dataTheoretical 2-bBased on the chemical mechanism proposed in Fig. 1.Calculated from the dataTheoretical 2-bBased on the chemical mechanism proposed in Fig. 1.mol Cys/mol enzymeWild type43.812.834.20.83.43C51S32.82.70.102.72.8−0.10C86S32.702.733.003.03C198S32.61.61.012.71.51.21C206S32.60.91.722.61.01.62C86S/C198S21.70–0.6 2-cThe experimental results were not reproducible and thus did not allow distinguishing between 1 or 2 free thiols.1.1–1.711.50–0.5 2-cThe experimental results were not reproducible and thus did not allow distinguishing between 1 or 2 free thiols.1.0–1.51C86S/C206S21.70–0.6 2-cThe experimental results were not reproducible and thus did not allow distinguishing between 1 or 2 free thiols.1.1–1.721.90–0.4 2-cThe experimental results were not reproducible and thus did not allow distinguishing between 1 or 2 free thiols.1.5–1.92C86S/C198S/C206S10.800.810.800.81The values indicated represent the average of three independent measurements of at least two enzyme concentrations (relative S.D. range, 10%).

In contrast no methionine was formed for the C51S mutant.Table IIIStoichiometry of Met formed in the absence of regenerating systemEnzymemol Met/mol enzymeWild type2.1C51S0C86S1.9C198S0.9C206S1.0C86S/C198S1.0C86S/C206S1.0C86S/C198S/C206S0.9The values indicated represent the average of three independent measurements of at least two enzyme concentrations (relative S.D. range, 10%).

Quantity of Met formed was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography after reaction with 10 mm MetSO without any regenerating system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A way to biochemically characterize a sulfenic acid intermediate is to use TNB−. Except for reacting on disulfide bonds, TNB− is a specific reagent for sulfenic acid derivatives provided that the oxidized Cys is accessible. Action of TNB− was performed only on wild type and the triple mutant C86S/C198S/C206S. These enzymes were first incubated in the presence of MetSO, and then excess of TNB− was added. A decrease of the absorbance at 410 nm to 1 equivalent of TNB−/mole of triple mutant was observed. A similar result was obtained when the triple mutant was treated with a stoichiometric amount of H2O2. In contrast no change in absorbance was observed with the triple mutant in the absence of MetSO treatment. This strongly suggested that the loss of absorbance at 410 nm was due to formation of a mixed disulfide bond between Cys-51 and TNB− with a concomitant release of 1 mol of H2O. Moreover, the fact that only an absorbance decrease at 410 nm was observed excluded a regeneration of free Cys-51 via an attack of a second molecule of TNB− on the TNB moiety of the mixed disulfide bond. For the wild type, a decrease of the absorbance at 410 nm was first observed but rapidly followed by an increase that led to a final constant absorbance at 410 nm (curves not shown). This suggested that formation of the mixed disulfide bond between Cys-51 and TNB− was followed by formation of another disulfide bond involving Cys-51 and another Cys via an intramolecular or intermolecular attack with concomitant release of TNB−. The nature of the Cys involved remains to be defined. Determinations of the molecular mass of wild type, C51S and C86S mutants, and C86S/C198S/C206S triple mutant were performed before and after treatment with MetSO but without thiol regenerating system. As shown in Table IV, a mass increase of about 16 Da was observed upon MetSO treatment for all tested MsrAs except for the C51S mutant, which showed no variation in mass. However, it should be pointed out that in cases in which a variation in mass was observed a mixture of two almost equivalent populations was characterized, one with a mass increase of about 16 Da and a second one without mass increase. In contrast, treatment with MetSO followed by incubation with dimedone, which is specific for sulfenic acid (20Benitez L.V. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6234-6243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Allison W.S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1976; 9: 293-299Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar), led to a homogeneous population with a mass increase of about 140 Da except for the C51S mutant, which showed no mass increase, whereas no mass increase was observed upon treatment with only dimedone (data not shown). All these results proved that reaction with MetSO was necessary for dimedone modification and strongly suggested the formation of a sulfenic acid on Cys-51. Similarly a mass increase of about 140 Da was observed upon dimedone treatment when C86S/C198S/C206S triple mutant was first treated with a stoichiometric amount of H2O2 (data not shown).Table IVElectrospray mass spectrometry analysesEnzymeBefore modification 4-aThe same results were observed after reaction with 200 μm dimedone (data not shown).After modificationWith MetSOWith MetSO and dimedoneTheoretical massMeasured massMeasured massMass difference 4-bMass differences measured by electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry correspond to the differences between the mass of the protein before and after trea"
https://openalex.org/W2072748745,"Previous work in the β2-adrenergic receptor demonstrated critical interactions between Ser-204 and Ser-207 in the fifth membrane-spanning segment and the meta-OH and para-OH, respectively, of catecholamine agonists (Strader, C. D., Candelore, M. R., Hill, W. S., Sigal, I. S., and Dixon, R. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13572–13578). Using the substituted cysteine accessibility method in the β2-adrenergic receptor, we have found that in addition to Ser-204 and Ser-207, Ser-203 is also accessible on the surface of the binding-site crevice and is occluded by bound agonist. Mutation of Ser-203 to Ala, Val, or Cys reduced the binding affinity and adenylyl cyclase-activating potency of agonists containing ameta-OH, whereas their affinities and potencies were largely preserved by mutation of Ser-203 to Thr, which maintained an OH at this position. Thus both Ser-203 and Ser-204 appear to interact with the meta-OH of catecholamines, perhaps through a bifurcated H bond. Furthermore, the removal of the OH at position 203 led to a significant loss of affinity of antagonists with nitrogen in their heterocyclic ring structure. The greatest effect was seen with pindolol, a partial agonist, suggesting that a H bond between the heterocyclic ring and Ser-203 may play a role in partial agonism. In contrast, the affinities of antagonists such as propranolol or alprenolol, which have cyclic structures without H-bonding capability, were unaltered after mutation of Ser-203. Previous work in the β2-adrenergic receptor demonstrated critical interactions between Ser-204 and Ser-207 in the fifth membrane-spanning segment and the meta-OH and para-OH, respectively, of catecholamine agonists (Strader, C.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). In these receptors, the binding site is formed among the seven-transmembrane segments (TMs) (2Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) in a water-accessible binding-site crevice. A number of residues inferred to contact bound agonist in the β2AR have been identified. Asp1133.32 (see “Experimental Procedures” for a description of the indexing of residues) in the third TM (TM3) is thought to interact with the protonated amine of catecholamines (3Strader C.D. Gaffney T. Sugg E.E. Candelore M.R. Keys R. Patchett A.A. Dixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is completely conserved in all amine receptors. A cluster of aromatic residues in TM6 that is thought to interact with the aromatic ring of catecholamines is highly conserved as well (2Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). A classical study by Strader et al. (4Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13572-13578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the β2AR demonstrated that two serines in TM5 directly interact with the catechol hydroxyls (OHs) of agonists. Specifically, Ser-2045.43 interacts with the meta-hydroxyl (mOH) and Ser-2075.46 with thepara-hydroxyl (pOH) (4Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13572-13578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions were shown to contribute to the affinity, potency, and efficacy of various catecholamine agonists. A potential role of Ser-2035.42 in binding and activation, however, was obscured by the lack of expression of the mutant β2AR in which Ser-2035.42 was mutated to Ala (4Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13572-13578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, because the catechol ring contains two hydroxyls and because two serines were inferred to hydrogen bond to these two hydroxyls, Ser-2035.42 has been generally assumed not to play a significant role in agonist binding to and activation of the wild-type β2AR. Curiously, β2AR Ser-2035.42 is completely conserved in all catecholamine receptors (Fig.1), and this residue has been shown to play a role in ligand binding and receptor activation in the α1A, α2A, and α1B adrenergic (5Hwa J.

In the rat α1AAR, in which a Ser is absent at 5.43, Ser-1885.42 (aligned with β2AR Ser-2035.42) interacts with the mOH of catecholamines, and it is this H bond that is critical for ligand binding and receptor activation (5Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6322-6327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (14Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 15Javitch J.A. Wess J. Structure/Function Analysis of G-protein-coupled Receptors. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 21-42Google Scholar), we found that in the dopamine D2 receptor each of the three aligned serines (Ser-1935.42, Ser-1945.43, Ser-1975.46) are accessible in the binding-site crevice (16Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16433-16439Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This is consistent with experimental results in the D2 receptor implicating each of the three serines in the binding of various ligands, although different serines were found to be more or less critical with different ligands (11Wiens B.L. Nelson C.S. Neve K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Cox B.A. Henningsen R.A. Spanoyannis A. Neve R.L. Neve K.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). More recently we have applied the substituted cysteine accessibility method to the aligned portion of TM5 in the human β2AR, 2G. Liapakis, D. Fu, and J. A. Javitch, manuscript in preparation. and we were surprised to observe that substitution of Ser-2035.42by Cys, unlike the published mutation of this Ser to Ala in the hamster β2AR (4Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13572-13578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not impair expression of the receptor but instead lowered its affinity for both isoproterenol and for the radiolabeled antagonist CGP-12177. Similar to our results in the D2 receptor, we found that Cys substituted for each of the three serines in TM5 of the β2AR reacted with charged sulfhydryl reagents and that bound isoproterenol retarded the reaction of the sulfhydryl reagents with the substituted cysteines. This suggests both that Ser-2035.42 is on the water-accessible surface of the binding-site crevice and that bound ligand sterically obstructs access to this position. This observation prompted us to reconsider the role of this Ser in ligand binding and receptor activation. We hypothesized that in the β2AR each of the serines interacts with catecholamine agonists and that the mode of binding might not be dramatically different in the β2AR as compared with related catecholamine receptors that also contain three serines in TM5. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the functional interaction between the β2AR and various agonists after the mutation of Ser-2035.42 to a number of other residues, of Ser-2045.43 to Ala, and of various combinations of two of the three conserved Ser residues (Ser-2035.42, Ser-2045.43, and/or Ser-2075.46) simultaneously to Ala. Our results are consistent with an important role for Ser-203 in the binding of catecholamines and the resulting activation of the β2AR. Residues are numbered according to their positions in the human β2AR sequence. We also index residues relative to the most conserved residue in the TM in which it is located (17Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2509) Google Scholar). By definition, the most conserved residue is assigned the position index 50, e.g. Pro-2115.50, and therefore Val-2105.49 and Leu-2125.51. This indexing simplifies the identification of aligned residues in different G-protein-coupled receptors. The cDNA sequence encoding the human β2-adrenergic receptor, epitope-tagged at the amino terminus with a cleavable influenza-hemagglutinin signal sequence followed by the FLAG epitope (IBI, New Haven, CT) and tagged with six histidines at the carboxyl terminus, was a gift from Dr. B. Kobilka (Stanford University) (18Kobilka B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This cDNA was subcloned into the bicistronic expression vector pcin4 (19Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. Biotechniques. 1996; 20: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), a gift from Dr. S. Rees (Glaxo Wellcome), thereby creating the vector pcin4-SFβ2AR6His. Mutations were generated by the polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis using Pfupolymerase (Stratagene). The polymerase chain reaction-generated DNA fragments containing the mutations were subcloned into the pcin4-SFβ2AR6His plasmid, and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutants are named as (wild-type residue)(residue number)(mutant residue), where the residues are given in the single-letter code. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) containing 3.15 g/liter glucose and 10% bovine calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfection with wild type (WT) or mutant β2AR and selection for generation of stably transfected pools of cells expressing the receptors were performed as described previously (20Javitch J.A. Fu D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18546-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cells suspensions were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were homogenized in 1 ml of binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.006% bovine serum albumin) using an OMNI 1000 Polytron homogenizer at setting 26–30 for 10–15 s at 4 °C. The homogenates were centrifuged at 13,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the membrane pellets (from a confluent 100-mm dish) were resuspended by homogenization, as described above, in 1 ml of binding buffer. The membrane suspensions were diluted (typically 1:20–1:40) in binding buffer and used for radioligand binding studies. Aliquots of diluted membrane suspension (200 μl) were incubated in binding buffer either with six different concentrations of the antagonist [3H]CGP-12177 between 40 and 1100 pm (in saturation binding experiments) or with increasing concentrations of agonists or antagonists in the presence of 0.7 nm[3H]CGP-12177 (in competition binding experiments). The total volume was adjusted to 0.5 ml, and the binding experiments were performed as described previously (20Javitch J.A. Fu D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18546-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The amount of membrane used was adjusted to ensure that the specific binding was always equal to or less than 10% of the total concentration of the added radioligand. Specific [3H]CGP-12177 binding was defined as total binding less nonspecific binding in the presence of 1 μmalprenolol (Research Biochemicals). Data for saturation and competition binding were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). IC50 values were obtained by fitting the data from the competition studies to a one-site competition model. K i values were determined using the equation K i = IC50/(1 + L/K D), whereL is the concentration of radioligand (21Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar). The experiments for the reaction of methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA) with the WT β2AR and the S203C mutant as well as the experiments for the protection of this reaction by isoproterenol were performed as described previously (20Javitch J.A. Fu D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18546-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells stably expressing the WT β2AR or the mutants were plated in 96-well cell culture plates (pretreated with poly-l-lysine, 0.1 mg/ml) at a density of 40,000–60,000 cells/well. After incubation overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cells were 95–100% confluent. The medium was removed, and 100 μl of OPTIMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with or without (control) 60–120 μm N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) was added. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed, and 100 μl of assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm choline, 288 mm sucrose, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) was added. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, more assay buffer without (basal levels) or with 10 μm forskolin or with increasing concentrations of agonists was added to a total volume of 200 μl, and the incubation was continued for 10 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation the assay buffer was removed. The cells were placed on ice and lysed with 3% trichloroacetic acid. Lysates were incubated on ice for 30–60 min and stored at −20 °C. After 1–5 days, frozen lysates were thawed and centrifuged at 1,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were neutralized with 2 n NaOH. Quantification of cAMP in the neutralized supernatants was performed using a competitive binding assay as described previously by Wattset al. (22Watts V.J. Wiens B.L. Cumbay M.G. Vu M.N. Neve R.L. Neve K.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8692-8699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Nordstedt and Fredholm (23Nordstedt C. Fredholm B.B. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Supernatants were transferred to polypropylene mini-tubes (20 μl/tube) containing buffer B (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA) with 1–1.1 nm [2,8-3H]adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic phosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subsequently, cAMP-binding protein (∼100 mg of crude bovine adrenal cortex extract in 500 μl of buffer B) was added to each tube. After incubation on ice for 2.5–3 h, the mixtures were filtered through GF/B glass fiber filters as described for radioligand binding assays. The amount of cAMP in each sample (one-tenth of a well) was determined by comparison with a standard curve of known concentrations of unlabeled cAMP (0.3–100 pmol/tube). EC50 values were obtained by fitting the data to a one-site sigmoidal model using nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism 3.0). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we constructed eight different β2AR mutants. The Ser at position 2035.42 was mutated to Ala (S203A), Val (S203V), Thr (S203T), or Cys (S203C); the Ser at position 2045.43was mutated to Ala (S204A). In three other mutants, two of Ser-2035.42, Ser-2045.43, and Ser-2075.46 were simultaneously mutated to Ala (S204A/S207A, S203A/S204A, S203A/S207A) to create a series of constructs in which each Ser was the only residue in this region capable of H-bonding to a catechol hydroxyl. Saturation analysis of [3H]CGP-12177 binding to membranes from HEK 293 cells stably expressing WT or the mutants showed that the receptor density (B max) of the mutants was 31–370% that of WT β2AR (data not shown). The affinity (K D) of the antagonist [3H]CGP-12177 was reduced by mutation of Ser-2035.42 to Ala (3-fold), Val (6-fold), and Cys (10-fold) (Table I). In contrast, the substitution of Thr for Ser-2035.42 (preserving the presence of a OH at this position) did not lower the affinity of [3H]CGP-12177 (Table I).Table IAntagonist binding to WT β2AR and the serine mutantsSaturation and competition binding studies were performed on membrane preparations from HEK 293 cells stably expressing WT or mutant receptors. The log IC50 values were obtained by fitting the data from the competition studies to a one-site competition model by nonlinear regression. The log K i values were determined from the log IC50 values according to the method of Cheng and Prusoff (21Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar). For CGP-12177 the log K ivalues are the log K d values obtained by fitting the data from saturation binding studies to a one-site binding model by nonlinear regression. The mean ± S.E. values are from 2–5 independent experiments. Values in parentheses areK i values of the mutants for each antagonist divided by the K i value of the WT and represent the decrease (↓) or increase (↑) in ligand affinity after mutation of β2AR. For S204A, S203A/S204A, and S203A/S207A, theK d values (pm) for [3H]CGP-12177 binding were 189 ± 10, 562 ± 112, and 237 ± 48, respectively. Saturation and competition binding studies were performed on membrane preparations from HEK 293 cells stably expressing WT or mutant receptors.

For S204A, S203A/S204A, and S203A/S207A, theK d values (pm) for [3H]CGP-12177 binding were 189 ± 10, 562 ± 112, and 237 ± 48, respectively. In competition experiments with [3H]CGP-12177 (Table I), the affinity of pindolol was reduced 24-, 67-, and 65-fold by mutation of Ser-2035.42 to Ala, Val, and Cys, respectively. In contrast, substitution of Thr for Ser-2035.42 only decreased the affinity of pindolol 5-fold. These mutations did not lower the affinities of alprenolol and propranolol for the β2AR. Indeed, removal of the OH at position 203 (S203V, S203C, S203A) increased the affinity of propranolol 2-, 5-, and 11-fold, respectively. As described above, mutation of Ser-2035.42 affected the affinities of particular antagonists. This effect might have resulted from either a direct effect of an alteration in the interaction of Ser-2035.42 with ligand or from an indirect effect through a propagated conformational alteration. For the effect to be direct, Ser-203 must be accessible on the surface of the binding-site crevice. In ongoing studies we are using the substituted cysteine accessibility method in TM5 of the β2AR to determine the residues that form the surface of the binding-site crevice.2Treatment of intact HEK 293 cells stably expressing WT β2AR with the hydrophilic, positively charged, sulfhydryl-specific reagent, MTSEA, did not affect [3H]CGP-12177-specific binding, suggesting that none of the endogenous Cys of the receptor was accessible for reaction (or that reaction took place but was without a functional effect) (Fig.2). MTSEA, however, potently inhibited [3H]CGP-12177 binding to the S203C mutant (Fig. 2), suggesting that the wild-type Ser-2035.42 side chain is on the water-accessible surface of the receptor. Isoproterenol (1 μm), a catecholamine with a structure similar to that of epinephrine but with a propyl moiety instead of a methyl attached to the protonated amine, substantially retarded the reaction of MTSEA with the S203C mutant (data not shown), suggesting that the residue is on the surface of the binding-site crevice and is sterically protected by bound agonist. We examined the affinities of a series of phenethylamine derivatives that only differed in the presence or absence of the mOH and the pOH on the aromatic ring. Thus, the derivative of phenethylamine containing a β-OH and a N-CH3, halostachine (HAL), contains no ring hydroxyls. Phenylephrine (HAL-mOH) is identical to HAL except for the addition of a mOH, synephrine (HAL-pOH) is identical to HAL except for the addition of a pOH, and epinephrine (HAL-mOHpOH) contains both the mOH and the pOH simultaneously (Table II). In the simplest scenario, if direct contact exists and disregarding solvation effects, the effect of removing a OH from a drug is expected to be similar to that of removing the associated side chain OH contact from the receptor. Agonist competition of [3H]CGP-12177 binding (Table II, Fig. 3) in membranes from HEK 293 cells expressing WT showed that HAL-mOHpOH had an affinity 96-fold higher than that of HAL, which contains no OHs on its aromatic ring. HAL-mOH had a 4-fold higher affinity than HAL, whereas HAL-pOH had an affinity nearly identical to HAL. Thus, the presence of both ring OHs synergistically increased the affinity of HAL-mOHpOH for WT.Table IIAgonist binding to WT β2AR and serine mutantsCompetition binding studies were performed on membrane preparations from HEK 293 cells stably expressing WT or mutant receptors, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The log IC50values were obtained by fitting the data to a one-site competition model by nonlinear regression.

These values represent the decrease (↓) or increase (↑) in the affinity after the modification of the β2AR (parentheses) or epinephrine (brackets/italics). The affinity of HAL-mOHpOH was reduced 71-, 25-, and 40-fold by mutation of Ser-2035.42 to Cys, Ala, or Val, respectively, whereas its affinity was reduced less than 3-fold by mutation of Ser-2035.42 to Thr, which preserved a OH at the 203 position (Table II, Fig. 3). Furthermore, in contrast to the 96-fold higher affinity of HAL-mOHpOH than HAL in WT, HAL-mOHpOH had an affinity nearly identical to that of HAL after mutation of Ser-203 to Cys, Ala, or Val. The affinity of HAL-mOHpOH, however, was 37-fold higher than that of HAL in S203T, in which a OH at position 203 was preserved. HAL-mOH had a 3-fold higher affinity than HAL in S203T, nearly the same as the 4-fold difference in WT. In contrast, HAL-mOH had a slightly lower affinity than HAL after substitution of Ser-2035.42by Cys, Ala, or Val, suggesting that the presence of a OH at position 203 is critical for the positive effect of the mOH on binding affinity. The affinities of HAL-pOH and HAL were essentially unaffected by mutation of Ser-2035.42 to Thr and Cys and slightly increased by mutation to Ala or Val. The affinity of S204A for epinephrine was decreased 34-fold relative to WT. If removal of the OH side chain at the Ser-204 position eliminated interaction with the mOH, we would have expected that removal of the mOH from epinephrine (synephrine) would not lower its affinity for S204A. However, we observed a higher affinity of epinephrine than of synephrine in this mutant (Table II), consistent with a preserved impact of the mOH despite the absence of Ser-2045.43. Moreover the affinity of HAL-mOH was higher than that of HAL in S204A, also consistent with a preserved interaction of the mOH. Simultaneous mutation of Ser-2035.42 and Ser-2045.43 to Ala decreased the affinity for epinephrine by 2 orders of magnitude (Table III, Fig.3). Thus the affinity of epinephrine for S203A/S204A was similar to that of HAL for WT. Moreover, removal of the mOH from epinephrine (synephrine) did not further decrease its affinity for S203A/S204A, consistent with the absence of a H bond with the mOH. Likewise, addition of the mOH to HAL did not increase the affinity in the simultaneous absence of Ser-2035.42 and Ser-2045.43. Simultaneous mutation of Ser-2035.42 and Ser-2075.46 to Ala also decreased the affinity for epinephrine by nearly 2 orders of magnitude (Table III, Fig. 3). Simultaneous mutation of Ser-2045.43and Ser-2075.46 to Ala decreased the affinity of each of the four phenethylamine derivatives tested (Table III, Fig. 3), consistent with an effect of the mutations on the isomerization of the receptor (24Hidalgo P.

This activity is localized to amino acids 17–35 in the N-terminal heparin-binding domain of thrombospondin and can be replicated by a peptide (hep I) with this sequence.

We now report that calreticulin on the cell surface mediates focal adhesion disassembly by thrombospondin/hep I. A 60-kDa protein from endothelial cell detergent extracts has homology and immunoreactivity to calreticulin, binds a hep I affinity column, and neutralizes thrombospondin/hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). When exposed to cells in its soluble form, thrombospondin has primarily anti-adhesive effects characterized by a reorganization of stress fibers and loss of focal adhesion plaques as ascertained by interference reflection microscopy (5Greenwood J.A.

A 19-amino acid sequence (amino acids 17–35) in the N-terminal heparin-binding domains of both TSP-1 and TSP-2, referred to as the hep I peptide, has been determined to be sufficient for focal adhesion disassembly (9Murphy-Ullrich J.E.

The signaling events stimulated by thrombospondin/hep I interactions with cells are only partially understood. It is known that thrombospondin/hep I binding to endothelial cells stimulates activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and generation of phosphatidylinositide(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) (8Greenwood J.A.

Basal levels of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase activity are also necessary for thrombospondin-mediated focal adhesion disassembly (10Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Pallero M.A. Boerth N. Greenwood J.A.

There are a number of molecules that act as cell surface binding molecules for the N-terminal heparin-binding domain of thrombospondin. These include heparan sulfate proteoglycans (11Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Westrick L.G. Esko J.D. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6400-6406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sun X.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24080-24086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that heparitinase-treated BAE cells are competent to signal hep I-induced focal adhesion disassembly, suggesting that heparan sulfate proteoglycans are not the receptors that mediate this activity of thrombospondin. The integrin-binding sequence in the heparin-binding domain of thrombospondin has been localized to a sequence distinct from that of the hep I peptide (16Krutzsch H.C. Choe B.J. Sipes J.M. Guo N. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24080-24086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to identify the receptor that mediates focal adhesion disassembly in response to the hep I sequence of thrombospondin.Calreticulin is a widely expressed calcium-binding protein found mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum but also in other cellular compartments. In the ER, calreticulin acts as a molecular chaperone and regulates calcium homeostasis (17Michalak M. Corbett E.F. Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The localization of calreticulin to other cellular compartments, including the cell surface, as secreted forms, and possibly in the cytoplasm and nucleus, is prompting reconsideration of calreticulin as a mediator of a broader array of cellular functions. Calreticulin apparently plays a critical role in the development of the myocardium as calreticulin knock-out animals exhibit severe cardiac deformities (18Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Support for important physiologic roles for calreticulin is provided by recent data showing that calreticulin inhibits angiogenesis and suppresses tumor cell growth (19Pike S.E. Yao L. Jones K.D.

Blood. 1999; 94: 2461-2468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Calreticulin can regulate cell adhesion by a number of different mechanisms. Intracellular calreticulin levels have been shown to regulate levels of vinculin and N-cadherin expression, implicating calreticulin in both cell-substrate and cell-cell adhesion (21Fadel M.P. Dziak E. Lo C. Ferrier J. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. Opas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15085-15094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cells overexpressing calreticulin have higher levels of vinculin expression and are consequently more adhesive. The mechanism whereby calreticulin in the ER regulates gene expression is unknown. Calreticulin can also regulate cell adhesion by modulating the affinity of integrin for its ligand through transient interactions with the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin α subunit (22Coppolino M.G. Woodside M.J. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. St-Arnaud R. Dedhar S. Nature. 1997; 386: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 23Coppolino M.G. Dedhar S. Biochem.

Consistent with this putative function is the observation that calreticulin-deficient ES cells have impaired cell adhesion (23Coppolino M.G. Dedhar S. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Rojiani W.V. Finlay B.B. Gray V. Dedhar S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9859-9866Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Calreticulin on the cell surface is reported to have a lectin-like function and to mediate cell spreading on glycosylated laminin (27McDonnell J.M. Jones G.E. White T.K. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7891-7894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the existence of cell surface forms of calreticulin are only beginning to be appreciated, and the role of this form of calreticulin as a modulator of cell adhesion has been obscure.By using a hep I affinity purification approach, we isolated a 60-kDa protein from detergent extracts of BAE cells with N-terminal sequence homology and immunoreactivity to the calcium-binding protein calreticulin. Here we report that thrombospondin binds calreticulin and that a cell surface form of calreticulin mediates the ability of thrombospondin or the hep I peptide to stimulate focal adhesion disassembly and activation of PI3K.DISCUSSIONTo our knowledge, this is the first report to identify calreticulin as a receptor for thrombospondin and to elucidate a role for calreticulin in mediating focal adhesion disassembly. This newly identified role for cell surface calreticulin as mediator of de-adhesive changes differs from data showing that ER or cytoplasmic calreticulin promotes stable cell adhesion (21Fadel M.P.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Calreticulin in the ER plays a role in the control of cell adhesiveness via regulation of vinculin expression. Both vinculin protein and mRNA levels are increased in L fibroblasts overexpressing calreticulin and are down-regulated in cells expressing reduced levels of calreticulin (45Opas M. Szewczenko-Pawlikowska M. Jass G.H. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Similar down-regulation of vinculin expression is observed in epithelial cells with a diminished level of calreticulin (21Fadel M.P. Dziak E. Lo C. Ferrier J. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. Opas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15085-15094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This coincides with an increase of total cellular phosphotyrosine, suggesting that the effects of calreticulin on cell adhesiveness may involve modulation of the activities of protein tyrosine kinases or phosphatases, which can affect the stability of focal contacts (21Fadel M.P.

On the other hand, it has also been shown that calreticulin associates transiently with the cytoplasmic domains of integrin α subunits during spreading and that this interaction can influence integrin-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (22Coppolino M.G.

Calreticulin-deficient embryonic stem cells have impaired integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin, although integrin expression is unaltered. Taken together, these results suggest that intracellular calreticulin promotes stable cell adhesion. This is in contrast to this present report in which calreticulin on the cell surface is involved in destabilizing cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion. However, there are examples of signaling mediators or cell adhesion molecules having differential effects on cell adhesion depending on cell type, the initial adhesive state of the cell, and the particular milieu of receptors and matrix molecules (5Greenwood J.A.

Recently, Arosa et al. (39Arosa F.A. de Jesus O. Porto G. Carmo A.M. de Sousa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16917-16922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) reported finding calreticulin expressed on the cell surface of activated human peripheral blood T lymphocytes, where it is physically associated with a pool of unfolded major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. In addition, it has been reported that calreticulin is also localized on the surface of neutrophils and participates in the pertussis toxin-sensitive signal transduction pathway stimulated by L5, an anti-microbial peptide (40Cho J. Homma K. Kanegasaki S. Natori S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Calreticulin can also be released from neutrophils during inflammation (37Kishore U. Sontheimer R.D. Sastry K.N. Zaner K.S. Zappi E.G. Hughes G.R.V. Khamashta M.A. Strong P. Reid K.B.M. Eggleton P. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have reported the presence of calreticulin on endothelial cells (50Peerschke E.I. Malhotra R. Ghebrehiwet B. Reid K.B. Willis A.C. Sim R.B. J.

Calreticulin on the surface of endothelial cells appears to be capable of modulating cell function, because it has been shown that calreticulin is involved in the production of interleukin-8 by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (51van den Berg R.H. Faber-Krol M. van Es L.A. Daha M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2206-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Calreticulin is readily detectable on the surface of resting bone marrow vascular endothelial cells, and its expression is up-regulated in response to inflammatory mediators (53Guo W.X. Ghebrehiwet B. Weksler B. Schweitzer K. Peerschke E.I.B. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1999; 133: 541-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Finally, there is evidence that calreticulin binds specifically and reversibly to bovine aortic endothelial cells in vitro (K dapproximately 7.4 nm) (36Kuwabara K. Pinsky D.J. Schmidt A.M. Benedict C. Brett J. Ogawa S. Broekman M.J. Marcus A.J. Sciacca R.R. Michalak M. Wang F. Pan Y. Grunfeld S. Patton S. Malinski T. Stern D.M. Ryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8179-8187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that secreted calreticulin can also modulate endothelial cell behavior.It is not clear how calreticulin is able to leave the ER and be transported to the cell surface. However, the expression of other KDEL-containing proteins at the cell surface has recently been shown (41Xiao G. Chung T.F. Pyun H.Y. Fine R.E. Johnson R.J. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In fact, newly synthesized calreticulin appears to be preferentially transported to the cell surface where it has a half-life of approximately 12 h (41Xiao G. Chung T.F. Pyun H.Y. Fine R.E. Johnson R.J. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These investigators also showed that calreticulin expressed on the surface of neuronal cells is turned over via a lysosomal degradation pathway (41Xiao G. Chung T.F. Pyun H.Y. Fine R.E. Johnson R.J. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N-terminal heparin-binding domain of thrombospondin that contains the hep I sequence also mediates rapid lysosomal degradation of thrombospondin via interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans and LDL-receptor-related proteins (11Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Westrick L.G. Esko J.D. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6400-6406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sun X. Mosher D.F. Rapraeger A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6784-6791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the hep I sequence is actually involved in the lysosomal degradation of thrombospondin, although it is possible that calreticulin binding to the hep I sequence in the N-terminal heparin-binding domain of thrombospondin may facilitate degradation of calreticulin.Antibodies to calreticulin block the ability of thrombospondin or hep I to stimulate activation of PI3K, strongly indicating that calreticulin can signal from the peripheral membrane to the inside of the cell. Yet it is not clear as to how a peripheral membrane protein can induce intracellular signals. Calreticulin binding to cells does not appear to be sufficient to signal focal adhesion disassembly (Fig. 8), suggesting that thrombospondin/hep I binding to cell-associated calreticulin might trigger a ligand-dependent association (activation) or dissociation (de-repression) of calreticulin with a transmembrane molecule. It is also possible that thrombospondin/hep I can bind directly to a pre-existing complex of calreticulin and a transmembrane protein to signal focal adhesion disassembly. It is interesting to note that the focal adhesion disassembly receptor for tenascin-C is also a calcium-binding peripheral membrane protein, annexin II (54Chung C.Y. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Erickson H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways activated by tenascin-C-annexin II interactions have not yet been determined, although it is known that tenascin-C does not activate PI3K (5Greenwood J.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 43: 420-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).It will be important to determine what factors regulate specific expression of calreticulin at the cell surface and how these factors correlate with the highly regulated patterns of thrombospondin expression. Both calreticulin and thrombospondin have been shown to be up-regulated under conditions of stress and/or response to injury (55Raugi G.J. Olerud J.E. Gown A.M. J. Invest.

Knowledge of these events and factors will help us to understand better the physiologic significance of thrombospondin-calreticulin interactions in regulating cytoskeletal organization, gene expression, and cell adhesion. Thrombospondin (TSP)1 is a member of a group of extracellular matrix proteins that exist in both soluble and extracellular matrix forms and that variably regulate cellular adhesion (1Adams J. Tucker R.P. Lawler J. The Thrombospondin Gene Family. Spring-Verlag, Heidelberg1995Google Scholar, 2Sage E.H. Bornstein P. J. Biol.

These proteins, which include tenascin-C and SPARC, in addition to thrombospondin, have been termed “matricellular” proteins to reflect their cell regulatory properties (4Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). When exposed to cells in its soluble form, thrombospondin has primarily anti-adhesive effects characterized by a reorganization of stress fibers and loss of focal adhesion plaques as ascertained by interference reflection microscopy (5Greenwood J.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 43: 420-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Höök M. J.

A 19-amino acid sequence (amino acids 17–35) in the N-terminal heparin-binding domains of both TSP-1 and TSP-2, referred to as the hep I peptide, has been determined to be sufficient for focal adhesion disassembly (9Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Gurusiddappa S. Frazier W.A. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26784-26789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling events stimulated by thrombospondin/hep I interactions with cells are only partially understood. It is known that thrombospondin/hep I binding to endothelial cells stimulates activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and generation of phosphatidylinositide(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) (8Greenwood J.A.

Basal levels of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase activity are also necessary for thrombospondin-mediated focal adhesion disassembly (10Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Pallero M.A. Boerth N. Greenwood J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2007263766,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), the key regulatory enzyme in the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, is rapidly degraded in mammalian cells supplemented with sterols or MVA. This accelerated turnover was blocked by N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), MG-132, and lactacystin, and to a lesser extent by N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-methional (ALLM), indicating the involvement of the 26 S proteasome. Proteasome inhibition led to enhanced accumulation of high molecular weight polyubiquitin conjugates of HMGR and of HMGal, a chimera between the membrane domain of HMGR and beta-galactosidase. Importantly, increased amounts of polyubiquitinated HMGR and HMGal were observed upon treating cells with sterols or MVA. Cycloheximide inhibited the sterol-stimulated degradation of HMGR concomitantly with a marked reduction in polyubiquitination of the enzyme. Inhibition of squalene synthase with zaragozic acid blocked the MVA- but not sterol-stimulated ubiquitination and degradation of HMGR. Thus, similar to yeast, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in the metabolically regulated turnover of mammalian HMGR. Yet, the data indicate divergence between yeast and mammals and suggest distinct roles for sterol and nonsterol metabolic signals in the regulated ubiquitination and degradation of mammalian HMGR."
https://openalex.org/W1973578316,"Type III secretion systems mediate export of virulence proteins and flagellar assembly subunits in Gram-negative bacteria. Chaperones specific to each class of secreted protein are believed to prevent degradation of the secreted substrates. We show that an additional role of chaperones may be to regulate translation of secreted proteins. We show that the chaperone FIgN is required for translation of the flgM gene transcribed from one mRNA transcript (a flagellar class 3 transcript), but not from another (a flagellar class 2 transcript). FIgM translated from the class 3 transcript is primarily secreted whereas FIgM translated from the class 2 transcript is primarily retained in the cytoplasm. These results suggest FIgM and other type III secretion substrates possess both mRNA and amino acid secretion signals, and supports a new role for type III chaperones in translation/secretion coupling."

To characterize further the function of NPC1, we generated stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines overexpressing the human NPC1 protein (CHO/NPC1). NPC1 overexpression increases the rate of trafficking of low density lipoprotein cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum and the rate of delivery of endosomal cholesterol to the plasma membrane (PM). CHO/NPC1 cells exhibit a 1.5-fold increase in total cellular cholesterol and up to a 2.9-fold increase in PM cholesterol. This increase in PM cholesterol is closely paralleled by a 3-fold increase in de novo cholesterol synthesis. Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis results in marked redistribution of PM cholesterol to intracellular sites, suggesting an unsuspected role for NPC1 in internalization of PM cholesterol. Despite elevated total cellular cholesterol, CHO/NPC1 cells exhibit increased cholesterol synthesis, which may be attributable to both resistance to oxysterol suppression of sterol-regulated gene expression and to reduced endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol levels under basal conditions.

Low density lipoprotein (LDL)1 and modified lipoprotein particles are trafficked to lysosomes, where the cholesteryl esters are hydrolyzed to free cholesterol (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bulk of LDL cholesterol is mobilized from lysosomes to the plasma membrane (PM) and subsequently cycles back to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (2Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A.

Approximately one-third of the unesterified lysosomal cholesterol is delivered directly to the ER via a PM-independent transport pathway (3Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cholesterol levels in the ER regulate cellular cholesterol homeostasis through a feedback regulatory mechanism that controlsde novo synthesis and cellular uptake of cholesterol. This regulatory system principally involves membrane-bound transcription factors known as sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar). When cells are sterol-depleted, the NH2-terminal regions of the SREBPs are released through a two-step proteolytic cleavage and translocate to the nucleus to promote transcription of multiple genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis. When cells are replete with sterols, proteolytic cleavage of SREBPs is prevented, resulting in attenuation of SREBP-dependent gene transcription. The Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) protein has been identified as a key participant in the intracellular trafficking of LDL cholesterol. Cells that harbor mutations in NPC1 accumulate cholesterol in lysosomes and exhibit delayed sterol-regulated gene expression (5Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol.

The retrovirally infected cells were plated at limiting dilution, and colonies were screened by Western blot analysis of microsomal fractions for human NPC1 expression (described under “Western Blot Analysis”). Cells were maintained in monolayer culture at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All CHO cell lines were maintained in medium A (1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F-12, 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin). Medium B consists of medium A in which fetal calf serum has been replaced with 5% (v/v) lipoprotein-deficient fetal calf serum. Medium C consists of medium B plus 20 μm compactin and 0.5 mm mevalonate. Compactin and mevalonate were prepared as described (14Brown M.S. Dana S.E. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2162-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). 293GPG cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 μg/ml puromycin, 0.3 μg/ml G418, and 1 μg/ml tetracycline. LDL labeled with [3H]cholesteryl linoleate (CL) ([3H]CL-LDL) was prepared with a specific activity of 17,000 cpm/nmol of total cholesteryl linoleate (15Krieger M. Brown M.S. Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4093-4101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomal proteins were prepared as described previously (16Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Bennett N.E. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28642-28650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and non-boiled samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5%) under reducing conditions. The gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose (0.45 mm; Schleicher & Schuell) with a semi-dry electroblotter (Owl Scientific). Western blot analysis of NPC1 expression was performed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against human NPC1 (amino acids 1261–1278) at a dilution of 1:1000 and a peroxidase-conjugated F(ab′)2fragment donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at 0.04 μg/ml. Detection was performed using a commercially available reagent (Renaissance, DuPont NEN). On day 0, CHO cell lines were plated at 0.7 × 104cells/well on 12-mm glass coverslips in 24-well dishes in medium A. For cells treated with U18666A, media was replaced 8–10 h after plating with U18666A (2 μg/ml) in medium A. On day 1, the cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. For experiments with LysoSensor staining, cells were incubated with 5 μm LysoSensor Green DND-153 for 2 h before fixation and staining. The cells were washed twice with PBS and stained (and permeabilized) with 50 μg/ml filipin in PBS/10% normal goat serum for 30 min. The cells were then stained for NPC1 using an affinity-purified antibody to the human NPC1 COOH terminus (amino acids 1261–1278). The cells were incubated with a 1:250 dilution of the α-NPC1 antibody in filipin/PBS/10% normal goat serum for 60 min on a shaker at 37 °C followed by incubation with a donkey anti-rabbit Cy3 secondary antibody at 5 μg/ml filipin/PBS/10% normal goat serum for 40 min on a shaker at 37 °C. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS, mounted (SlowFade, Molecular Probes), and examined by fluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss Axiovert epifluorescence microscope. The following filter sets (Chroma) were used: for filipin, excitation filter 360/40 nm, beamsplitter 400 nm, emission filter 460/50 nm; for LysoSensor, excitation filter 470/40 nm, beamsplitter 500 nm, emission filter 535/40 nm; for Cy3, excitation filter 535/50 nm, beamsplitter 565 nm, emission filter 590 nm. Cholesterol esterification assays were performed as described by Goldstein et al. (17Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). On day 0, CHO cell lines were seeded in triplicate (2.5 × 104 cells/35-mm well) in medium A. On day 1, the cells were washed twice with PBS and refed medium B. On day 2, the cells were fed medium B with 50 μg/ml LDL. On day 3, the cells were pulsed with [3H]oleate for 2 h and washed three times with Tris-buffered saline at 4 °C, and lipids were extracted with hexane:isopropyl alcohol (3:2). A chromatography recovery standard was added (30 μg cholesteryl oleate, 30 μg triolein, 0.0005 μCi [14C]cholesteryl oleate), and the samples were dried under nitrogen. The lipids were separated by TLC (PE SIL G plates, Whatman) using heptane:ethyl ether:acetic acid (90:30:1) and visualized with iodine. The [3H]cholesteryl oleate was quantified by liquid scintillation counting in Ecoscint (National Diagnostics). After lipid extraction, monolayers were incubated with 0.1 nNaOH, and protein determination was performed using the MicroBCA assay (Pierce). LDL-specific cholesterol esterification was determined by subtracting esterification rates for non-LDL-fed cells from LDL-fed cells. On day 0, CHO, M12, and CHO/NPC1 cells were seeded in triplicate (5 × 104 cells/35-mm well) in medium A. On day 2, the cells were washed three times with PBS and refed medium B. On day 3, the cells were fed 20 μg/ml of [3H]CL-LDL in medium B plus 20 μg/ml progesterone. On day 4, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with medium B plus 2% CD for up to 2 h. Lipids were extracted from the media (CH3Cl:methanol (2:1)) and the cells (hexane:isopropyl alcohol (3:2)), a recovery standard was added (0.0005 μCi [14C]cholesteryl oleate for media lipid samples; 80 μg cholesterol, 30 μg cholesteryl oleate, and 0.0005 μCi [14C]cholesteryl oleate for cellular lipid samples), and lipids were dried under nitrogen. Lipids were extracted from media by CH3Cl:methanol (2:1), and cellular lipids were separated by TLC as described above using heptane:isopropyl ether:acetic acid (60:40:4) as the solvent. [3H]Cholesterol was quantified by scintillation counting. Protein determinations were performed using the MicroBCA assay. The percent cholesterol efflux was determined as the amount of [3H]cholesterol in the medium divided by the sum of the [3H]cholesterol in medium plus the [3H]cholesterol in the cell extract. Cholesterol oxidase treatment was performed as described previously (3Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). On day 0, CHO, M12, and CHO/NPC1 cell lines were seeded in triplicate (5 × 104 cells/35-mm well) in medium A. On day 2, the cells were washed twice with PBS and refed medium B. On day 3, the cells were fed either medium B or medium C with 1 μCi [3H]cholesterol/well. On day 4, each well was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline plus 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) at 4 °C for 5 min on a shaker, and rapidly washed twice with PBS at room temperature. The cells were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and incubated with cholesterol oxidase (2 units/well) and sphingomyelinase (0.1 units/well) in Ham's F-12 for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and lipids were extracted as described above. A chromatography recovery standard was added (20 μg cholesterol, 40 μg cholestenone, 30 μg cholesteryl oleate, 0.0005 μCi [14C]cholesteryl oleate), and the samples were dried under nitrogen. TLC was performed as above using heptane:ethyl ether:acetic acid (90:30:1) as the solvent. [3H]Cholesterol, [3H]cholestenone, and [3H]cholesteryl oleate were quantified as described above. Protein determinations were performed on parallel wells plated in triplicate using the MicroBCA assay. Metabolic labeling of de novo-synthesized cholesterol was performed as described previously (18Rawson R. Cheng D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28261-28269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On day 0, CHO, M12, CT60, and CHO/NPC1 cells were seeded in triplicate in (2.5 × 104 cells/35-mm well) in medium A. On day 1, the cells were washed three times with PBS and refed medium B. On day 2, the cells were washed three times with PBS and refed medium B with 0.5 mm[14C]acetate (25 dpm/pmol). After a 2-h incubation, the cells were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline at 4 °C, and lipids were extracted as described above. A chromatography recovery standard was added (20 μg cholesterol, 30 μg cholesteryl oleate, 0.002 μCi [3H]cholesterol), and the samples were dried under a stream of nitrogen. TLC and [14C]cholesterol quantification was performed as described under “Cholesterol Oxidase Treatment,” and protein determination was performed using the MicroBCA assay. On day 0, CHO, CT60, and CHO/NPC1 cells were plated in duplicate (6 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) in medium A. On day 1, the cells were co-transfected with 1.5 μg of pSyn SRE and 0.5 μg of pCMVβgal. Four hours post-transfection, the media was changed to medium C supplemented with 0–1.0 μg/ml 25-HC. On day 2, cells were harvested in reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed in duplicate for each sample. The luciferase activity in the transfected cells was normalized to β-galactosidase expression to correct for transfection efficiency. The in vitro esterification assay was performed as described by Lange and Steck (19Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13103-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and washed in 0.25m sucrose, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 0.1 m sucrose, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and swelled on ice for 10 min. The cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (100–200 strokes), centrifuged to remove large particles, and adjusted to 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The esterification reaction was started by the addition of 25 μm [14C]oleoyl-CoA followed by incubation for 2 h at 37 °C. After extraction with CH3Cl:methanol (2:1) and addition of a recovery standard (40 μg cholesterol, 30 μg cholesteryl oleate, 0.002 μCi [3H]cholesterol), lipids were dried under nitrogen. Cholesteryl oleate was recovered by TLC and quantified as described under “LDL-stimulated Cholesterol Esterification Assay.” Protein determinations were performed using the BCA assay. To study the function of NPC1, we used a retroviral expression system to establish stable CHO cell lines that overexpress NPC1. The human NPC1 cDNA was cloned into the ΔU3 retroviral vector and transfected into 293GPG-packaging cells to generate high titer virus encoding NPC1 (12Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The virus was used to infect CHO cells at high multiplicity of infection, and clonal cell lines were isolated by plating at limiting dilution. The clones were screened for NPC1 expression by Western blotting of microsomal proteins with an antibody to the COOH terminus of NPC1 (amino acids 1261–1278) (Fig. 1). This antibody recognizes proteins of 220 and 170 kDa in wild-type CHO cells and detects no protein in M12 cells in which the NPC1 locus has been deleted.2 We observe an identical pattern on Western blots using a previously characterized antibody to NPC1 residues 1256–1274 (data not shown) (20Patel S.C. Suresh S. Kumar U. Hu C.Y. Cooney A. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Neufeld E.B. Patel R.C. Brady R.O. Patel Y.C. Pentchev P.G. Ong W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1657-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The 220- and 170-kDa bands likely represent heterogeneously glycosylated NPC1 and have been observed by others (21Watari H. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Glick J.M. Patel S. Neufeld E.B. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because the COOH termini of human and hamster NPC1 only share 78% identity from residues 1261–1278, the NPC1 antibody demonstrates a preference for recognition of human over endogenous CHO sequences (note the 8-fold difference in amount of protein loaded in CHO versusCHO/NPC1 and human normal skin fibroblasts (NSF)lanes). Therefore, to estimate levels of transgene expression, we compared NPC1 expression in the CHO/NPC1 cell lines with the endogenous NPC1 expression in human NSF. Among the CHO/NPC1 cell lines, expression of NPC1 varies over a 12-fold range, with NPC1–1 ≈ NPC1–27 > NPC1–9 > NPC1–28. The lowest expressing CHO/NPC1 cell line, NPC1–28, expressed human NPC1 at a level 1.3-fold above NSF. The highest expressing CHO/NPC1 cell line, NPC1–1, expressed human NPC1 at a level 15-fold above NSF. Immunofluorescence studies were performed to confirm the expression of NPC1 in these cell lines and to establish that when overexpressed in CHO cells, the human NPC1 protein distributes to appropriate cellular compartments. We co-stained fixed, permeabilized cells with affinity-purified antibody to the NPC1 COOH terminus and with filipin, a fluorescent polyene antibiotic that specifically binds unesterified cholesterol (22Pentchev P.G. Comly M.E. Kruth H.S. Vanier M.T. Wenger D.A. Patel S. Brady R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In wild-type CHO cells under basal conditions (Fig. 2 A), weak staining for NPC1 was observed in granular structures that have been identified in previous studies as late endosomes (9Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S. Suresh S. Cooney A.M. Dwyer N.K. Roff C.F. Ohmo K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Incardoma J.P. Strauss III, J.F. Vanier M.T. Patterson M.C. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9627-9635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). This staining was not observed in controls with secondary antibody-staining alone (data not shown). Filipin staining was observed in a Golgi-like pattern and at the cell periphery (Fig. 2 B). NPC1-staining was not observed in the NPC1-null, filipin-positive M12 cell line (Fig. 2, C andD). In CHO/NPC1 cell lines, robust NPC1 staining was observed in granular and reticular structures (Fig. 2 E). Filipin primarily stained the PM and granular structures in the CHO/NPC1 cells (Fig. 2 F). The intensity of filipin staining exceeded that of parental CHO cells, suggesting that these cells have increased cellular cholesterol content. To show that overexpressed NPC1 is also appropriately localized in the setting of pharmacologic block of cholesterol trafficking, CHO/NPC1 cells were incubated with U18666A. This hydrophobic amine inhibits mobilization of lysosomal cholesterol and results in the NPC mutant phenotype (10Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11796-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). U18666A-treated cells were co-stained with an antibody for NPC1, filipin, and a LysoSensor probe that specifically stains acidic organelles (23Barasch J. Kiss B. Prince A. Saiman L. Gruenert D. Al-Awqti Q. Nature. 1991; 352: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). After treatment with U18666A, there was a decrease in the granular NPC1-staining pattern and appearance of multiple, large, perinuclear vesicular structures whose periphery stains intensely for NPC1 (Fig. 3 A, see arrows). Many of these structures are cholesterol-rich as demonstrated by filipin staining (Fig. 3 B) and co-stain with LysoSensor probe (Fig. 3 C), consistent with a late endosomal or lysosomal localization. This pattern of circumferential staining around cholesterol-containing vesicular structures after U18666A treatment is similar to the staining we have observed in mutant cell lines that have normal NPC1 expression but genetic blocks in the cholesterol-trafficking pathway. 3A. Frolov, K. Srivastava, D. Daphna-Iken, L. M. Traub, J. E. Schaffer, and D. S. Ory, manuscript in preparation. To characterize the effects of NPC1 overexpression on LDL cholesterol trafficking, we compared LDL-stimulated cholesterol esterification in wild-type CHO, M12, and CHO/NPC1 cell lines. In normal cells, uptake of LDL cholesterol expands the cellular cholesterol pool and activates acyl-CoA:cholesterolO-acyltransferase (ACAT), catalyzing the esterification of both de novo-synthesized and LDL-derived cholesterol in the ER (3Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in medium B, fed LDL 50 μg/ml overnight, and pulsed for 2 h with [3H]oleate. Esterification rates, as determined by incorporation of [3H]oleate into [3H]cholesteryl oleate, are shown in Fig. 4 as a percentage of the rate observed for wild-type CHO cells. As expected, M12 cells have severely impaired LDL-stimulated cholesterol esterification rates (20% of wild-type CHO cells). Overexpression of NPC1 results in up to a 60% increase in esterification rates compared with wild-type CHO cells and up to an 8.1-fold increase compared with M12 cells. The observed esterification rates correlated with the level of NPC1 expression by Western blotting, suggesting a dose-dependent relationship between the amount of NPC1 protein and the delivery of LDL cholesterol to acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase. We also examined the effect of NPC1 overexpression on the delivery of endosomal cholesterol to the PM. CHO and CHO/NPC1 cells were incubated with progesterone and [3H]CL-LDL for 24 h and treated with 2% CD for up to 2 h, and the rates of cholesterol efflux were measured during a progesterone wash-out phase. After a 2-h incubation with CD, cholesterol efflux from the M12 cells was decreased by 30% as compared with wild-type CHO cells (Fig. 5). NPC1 overexpression increased cholesterol efflux in the NPC1–27 and NPC1–28 cell lines by 43 and 21%, respectively, as compared with wild-type CHO cells. These findings are consistent with previous studies that support a role for NPC1 in the mobilization of lysosomal cholesterol (2Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K.

Since transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) modulates many osteoblast activities, we hypothesized that the growth factor acts in part by modulating integrin expression. TGF-β increased cell adhesion to vitronectin and up-regulated the surface level of αvβ5 via increasing β5 protein synthesis by a transcriptional mechanism. Promoter activity analysis demonstrated that a TGF-β-responsive element resides between nucleotides −63 and −44. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunoprecipitation/Western studies indicated that the nuclear complex formed using the −66/−42 oligonucleotide contained both Sp1/Sp3 and Smad proteins. Since nuclear Sp1/Sp3 levels were not altered, whereas Smad levels were increased by TGF-β, we investigated the roles of Smad proteins in the up-regulation of β5 gene activation. Co-transfection of cells with β5 promoter reporter construct and expression vectors for Smad3, Smad4, and Sp1 increased the stimulatory effect of TGF-β. Furthermore, expression of dominant negative Smad3 or Smad4 in cells decreased or abolished the stimulation of β5 promoter activity by TGF-β. Smad4 mutant also inhibited the up-regulation of surface β5 level by TGF-β. Thus, TGF-β increases expression of the integrin β5 gene by mechanisms involving Sp1/Sp3 and Smad transcription factors.

Whereas collagen and fibronectin are the ligands for several β1integrins, other bone matrix proteins, such as osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, and vitronectin can interact with αvβ5 (33Hu D.D.

When osteoblasts are cultured on osteopontin or bone sialoprotein, their proliferation and differentiation profiles are altered (37Liu Y.K. Uemura T. Nemoto A. Yabe T. Fujii N. Ushida T. Tateishi T.

Expression of integrins can be regulated by cytokines and growth factors (39Kim L.T. Yamada K.M. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 214: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TGF-β increases the expression of αvβ3, αvβ5, and several β1 containing integrins in a variety of cells (40Zambruno G. Marchisio P.C. Marconi A. Vaschieri C. Melchiori A. Giannetti A. De Luca M. J.

It has been well established that Smad proteins mediate the signal transduction for TGF-β (43Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar, 44Padgett R.W. Cho S.H. Evangelista C. Pharmacol.

These pathway-restrictive Smads then form complexes with Smad4, and these complexes migrate into the nucleus, where they exert transcriptional activities either directly or indirectly. Since TGF-β can induce osteoblast migration and differentiation and αvβ5, found on osteoblasts, has been reported to mediate cell migration, adhesion, and function in other cell systems (33Hu D.D.

We report here that TGF-β augments surface expression of αvβ5 by enhancing transcription of the β5 subunit gene in murine osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1, via a mechanism that requires both Sp1/Sp3 and Smad proteins. The higher surface levels of the integrin result in increased adhesion of growth factor-treated osteoblasts to vitronectin. TGF-β2 was generously provided by Dr. Nico C.

The murine osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 was cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS) until confluence. After changing to medium containing 0.2% HIFBS overnight, cells were treated with either vehicle or TGF-β, which was dissolved in 4 mm HCl containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA). Only cells less than passage 22 from our stocks were used. Adhesion of cells to vitronectin was performed as described previously (34Cheng S.L. Lai C.-F. Fausto A. Chellaiah M. Feng S. McHugh K.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Civitelli R. Hruska K.A. Ross F.P. Avioli L.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with TGF-β (1 ng/ml) or vehicle for 24 h. Single cell suspensions obtained after collagenase and trypsin/EDTA digestion were washed three times with serum-free α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% BSA and allowed to recover for 30 min on a rotating platform at 37 °C. 1 × 105 cells were seeded to each well of 48-well Costar plates, which were pre-coated with vitronectin (5 μg/ml, 0.25 ml/well) or BSA. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, wells were washed three times with PBS, and the number of adherent cells measured by absorbance at 630 nm after staining the cells with 0.5% toluidine blue in 4% paraformaldehyde and dissolving the blue stain in 1% SDS. Cells in p-150 culture dishes were treated with TGF-β (1 ng/ml) or vehicle for 24 h, washed with PBS, and surface-labeled by treatment with lactoperoxidase (20 μg) and glucose oxidase (0.05 units) in 1 ml of 5 mmβ-d-glucose in PBS containing 125I-NaI (250 μCi/plate) as described previously (34Cheng S.L. Lai C.-F. Fausto A. Chellaiah M. Feng S. McHugh K.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Civitelli R. Hruska K.A. Ross F.P. Avioli L.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cell layers were extracted with 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 2% Renex 30, and 1 mm AEBSF) and further homogenized by passing through 18-gauge needles. After micro-centrifugation, aliquots (approximately 400 μl) of each supernatant containing equal trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity were precleared with protein A-Sepharose followed by incubation with polyclonal antibody against β5 (5 μl) and 200 μl of protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C on a Nutator. After centrifugation, pellets were washed twice with 500 μl of RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.12 TIU/ml aprotinin, and 0.02% NaN3), followed by PT (0.5% Tween 20 and 0.02% NaN3 in PBS) containing 1 mg/ml ovalbumin, and finally with PT. Pellets were extracted with sample buffer without reducing reagent (80 μl/tube) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The immunoprecipitated integrins were visualized by autoradiography. The band intensity was quantitated by image analysis using ISS SepraScan 2001 (Integrated Separation Systems, Natick, MA). For metabolic labeling, cells were treated with vehicle or TGF-β together with Tran35S-label (25 μCi/ml) for 24 h, and the cell layer was harvested. Immunoprecipitation with anti-β5antibody was performed as described above. Cells in p-150 culture dishes were treated with either TGF-β (1 ng/ml) or vehicle for 24 h. Poly(A)+ mRNA-enriched RNA was extracted by using the Ultra RiboSep kit according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer, separated by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon membrane, and fixed under UV light. mRNA on the membrane was hybridized with Megaprime-labeled [32P]cDNA for mouse β5 integrin and reprobed with [32P]cDNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) for loading variation. Bands of mRNA were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by image analysis using ISS SepraScan. Generation of progressive 5′- to 3′-deletion constructs of murine β5 promoters has been described previously (49Feng X. Teitelbaum S.L. Quiroz M.E. Towler D.A. Ross F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1366-1374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 1-kb fragment was isolated from theAccI-digested products of the β5 genomic 9-kb fragment. Deletion constructs of this 1-kb fragment were obtained by using the Exonuclease III/Mung Bean Nuclease kit from Stratagene. All the fragments were subcloned into pGL3-basic vector containing the luciferase reporter gene. The promoter constructs used in this study spanned from −875, −483, −340, −310, −274, −63, −43, and −28 to +110 from the transcription start site. Point mutations were introduced into the proximal β5 promoter (from −63 to +110) in pGL3, using a Site-directed Mutagenesis kit. Briefly, polymerase chain reactions were performed in a 50-μl volume with Pfupolymerase, 10 ng of β5 (−63/+110) pGL3 template, and 125 ng of respective pair of oligonucleotides described below using the following conditions: 95 °C/30 s, one cycle; 95 °C/30 s, 55 °C/1 min, 68 °C/12 min, 16 cycles; leave at 4 °C. Polymerase chain reaction products were treated with DpnI (10 units) for 1 h at 37 °C and used to transform XL 1-Blue supercompetent cells. Plasmids were prepared from individual colonies and sequenced to confirm the correctness of the introduced mutations. Oligonucleotides used to mutate the Sp1/Sp3 site within −53/−48 (m1) were 5′-GTCCCGGTGCAGttCGGAGCTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGCTCCGaaCTGCACCGGGAC-3′. Oligonucleotides used to mutate the Sp1/Sp3 site within −24/−19 (m2) were 5′-GAGCTCGCCCCGaaCCGTCCCGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCGGGACGGttCGGGGCGAGCTC-3′. Oligonucleotides used to mutate the Sp1/Sp3 site within +28/+33 (m3) were 5′-GCAGGAGAGGGttGAGGAGAAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTTTCTCCTCaaCCCTCTCCTGC-3′. Lowercase lettersdenote mutation sites. All oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and purified by PAGE. MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran for promoter activity analysis as described previously (34Cheng S.L. Lai C.-F. Fausto A. Chellaiah M. Feng S. McHugh K.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Civitelli R. Hruska K.A. Ross F.P. Avioli L.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at high density (150,000/well) onto 24-well plates in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% HIFBS. Eighteen hours later, cells were transfected with 2 μg/ml promoter construct to be tested and 0.7 μg/ml CMVβ-gal plasmid using DEAE-dextran and a 90-s shock with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. After 24 h of recovery in growth medium, cells were treated with vehicle or TGF-β (1 ng/ml) in medium containing 0.2% HIFBS for an additional 24 h, at which time cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer followed by measurement of luciferase activity using Optocomp II Luminometer (MGM Instruments, Inc, Hamden, CT). Luciferase activities were normalized with the β-galactosidase activities in extracts measured using the β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System with Reporter Lysis Buffer kit. To test the effects of various expression vectors on promoter activities, cells were transfected with β5 promoter (0.2 μg/well) together with indicated expression vector (0.2 μg/well for each vector) or empty vector (pcDNA3) and CMVβ-gal plasmid (0.07 μg/well) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. After overnight incubation, cells were treated and analyzed as described above. Nuclear extracts from MC3T3-E1 cells, previously treated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β or vehicle, were prepared as described (50Shreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar). 2–4 × 107 cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.6% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min to allow swelling. After vortexing for 10 s, lysates were micro-centrifuged for 10 min at maximum speed to obtain nuclei pellets which were then extracted with high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.12 TIU/ml aprotinin) for 1 h. Protein concentration of extracts was measured using Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. For EMSA, radioactive double-stranded oligonucleotide −66/−42, labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, was incubated with nuclear extracts (2 μg) or 0.5 footprint unit (1 footprint unit is the amount required to give full DNase I protection under standard conditions) of recombinant Sp1 protein in an ice bath for 20 min in 14 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 20% glycerol, and 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)). Assays were terminated by addition of 1 μl of 5× TBE buffer (0.445m Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 10 mm EDTA) containing 0.03% bromphenol blue, 0.03% xylene cyanol, and 30% glycerol and analyzed by electrophoresis at 4 °C using 4–20% polyacrylamide gels in 0.3× TBE at 125 V for 2.5 h. Gels were dried, and autoradiography was performed. For competitive oligonucleotide or supershift assays, 100-fold unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides, 1 μg of indicated antibodies, or 10 μm mithramycin were incubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min before the addition of the radioactive probe. Nuclear extracts (25 μg) from control or TGF-β-treated MC3T3-E1 cells were applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE and then blotted to an Immobilon-P membrane. Western analysis was performed by incubating the membrane with rabbit anti-Sp1 or Sp3 antibody (1:2000) or anti-pan-Smad antibodies (an equal mixture of anti-Smad antibody (C-17) and anti-Smad4 antibody (B-8)) (1:150), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000), according to the rapid detection protocol provided by Millipore. Sp1, Sp3, and Smad proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using an ECL kit. To detect Smad proteins in complexes with Sp1 and Sp3, RIPA buffer-diluted nuclear extracts (100 μg of protein) were first immunoprecipitated with goat anti-Sp1 antibody (5 μl) and rabbit anti-Sp3 antibody (1 μl), respectively, and extracted with protein A-Sepharose. The extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and probed with anti-Smad4 antibody (1:500). MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with pcDNA3 plasmid carrying FLAG-tagged dominant negative Smad3 or Smad4 cDNA (51Nishimura R. Kato Y. Chen D. Harris S.E. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1872-1879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent. Stably transfected cell lines were generated by incubation in medium containing G418 (1 mg/ml) and used within five passages. Expression of these dominant negative Smad proteins was verified by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Each experiment was performed at least twice. The data were presented as mean ± S.E. Treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with TGF-β for 24 h increased cell adhesion to vitronectin to 2.9-fold of the control level (Fig. 1). Since adhesion of osteoblasts (34Cheng S.L. Lai C.-F. Fausto A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 11008-11013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to vitronectin is dependent on αvβ5, these data suggested that TGF-β up-regulated the expression or the activities of αvβ5 integrin on the surface of osteoblasts. Surface labeling of MC3T3-E1 cells, followed by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic tail of β5 and SDS-PAGE indicated that TGF-β treatment increased surface levels of β5 (and hence αvβ5) to 2.7-fold of the control level (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether this increase in surface expression was derived via increased synthesis, cells were metabolically labeled with Tran35S-label during treatment with TGF-β or vehicle, and immunoprecipitation was repeated as described above. As shown in Fig.2 B, TGF-β up-regulated the synthesis of β5protein (6.6-fold of control level). Consistent with the increased β5 protein synthesis, normalized Northern blot analysis demonstrated that TGF-β increased β5 steady-state mRNA level to 2.3-fold of the control level (Fig. 2 C). Thus, TGF-β stimulated expression of αvβ5by increasing β5 mRNA level and protein synthesis. To examine whether up-regulation of β5mRNA by TGF-β resulted from increased gene transcription, MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with progressive 5′ end-deleted β5 promoter constructs carrying luciferase reporter gene. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, TGF-β stimulated the activities of all the promoter constructs that included the first 63 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site. Further deletion of the promoter construct at the 5′ end to −43 or −28 eliminated TGF-β-mediated up-regulation (Fig. 3). Thus, TGF-β stimulated β5 expression via transcriptional mechanism(s), and a TGF-β-responsive element resided between nucleotides −63 and −44 (−63/−44) of the murine β5integrin gene. To confirm that a TGF-β-responsive element was indeed present between nucleotides −63 and −44 in the β5proximal promoter, EMSA was performed after incubating the nuclear extracts, derived from either control or TGF-β-treated cells, with double-stranded radiolabeled oligonucleotide −66/−42. As shown in Fig. 4, three bands were observed in all samples tested. Two bands migrated as a closely spaced doublet, and the third was a faint, more rapidly migrating band. Treatment with TGF-β for 6 or 24 h increased the band intensities as compared with the corresponding control levels (Fig. 4). The stimulation by TGF-β tapered off after 48 h (Fig. 4). These data indicated that TGF-β stimulated the binding of nuclear factor(s) to the region −66/−42 of the murine β5 integrin gene. Sequence analysis of the β5 proximal promoter (49Feng X. Teitelbaum S.L. Quiroz M.E. Towler D.A. Ross F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1366-1374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of three potential Sp1/Sp3-responsive elements, between nucleotides −53/−48, −24/−19, and +28/+33 (Fig. 5). The promoter analysis described above (Fig. 3) indicated that the site at −53/−48 was the likely TGF-β-responsive element, whereas the remaining two Sp1/Sp3-like sites were inactive. To confirm this hypothesis, we used site-specific mutagenesis to generate promoter luciferase constructs carrying mutation at each of the three Sp1/Sp3-like sites. As expected, TGF-β stimulated the wild type promoter activity (Fig. 6 A). When the nucleotides GG at −52 and −51 positions of the −53/−48 were mutated to TT (m1, Fig. 6 B), TGF-β stimulation was abolished (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, mutation of the other two sites (m2 and m3, Fig. 6 B) did not affect TGF-β stimulation, although the reporter activity of m2 was very low, only 5% of wild type activity (Fig. 6 A). Thus, the region −53/−48 is the sole TGF-β-responsive element in the β5 integrin promoter.Figure 6Effects of mutation in Sp1/Sp3 sites on TGF-β up-regulation of β5 promoter activity. Cells were transfected with wild type (WT) or mutant (m1, m2, or m3) promoter constructs. After 24 h treatment with vehicle (Control) or TGF-β, luciferase activities were measured.

Herein, we confirm that human peripheral blood B or T lymphocytes (PBL) do not possess measurable levels of 85-kDa PLA2 as assessed by Western immunoblot.

Mitogen activation of PBLs resulted in maintenance of activity levels which remained constant over 72 h suggesting an important role for iPLA2 in this proliferative process. Indeed, evaluation of iPLA2 activity in cell cycle-arrested Jurkat T cell fractions revealed the highest iPLA2 levels occurring at the G2/M phase. Addition of the iPLA2 inhibitors, bromoenol lactone, or arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AAOCF3), inhibited both mitogen-induced PBL as well as Jurkat T cell proliferation. Moreover, specific depletion of iPLA2 protein by antisense treatment also resulted in marked suppression of cell division. Inhibition of Jurkat cell proliferation was not associated with arrest at a particular phase of the cell cycle nor was it associated with apoptosis as assessed by flow cytometry. These findings provide the first evidence that iPLA2 plays a key role in the lymphocyte proliferative response.

Inhibition of Jurkat cell proliferation was not associated with arrest at a particular phase of the cell cycle nor was it associated with apoptosis as assessed by flow cytometry. These findings provide the first evidence that iPLA2 plays a key role in the lymphocyte proliferative response. phospholipid arachidonic acid phospholipase A2 bromoenol lactone calcium-independent phospholipase A2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay phytohemagglutinin peripheral blood B or T lymphocytes reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction recombinant human arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone Activation of resting lymphocytes occurs by ligation of antigen-specific co-receptors or artificially through mitogen stimulation. This in turn results in the formation of blast cells which undergo cellular proliferation, differentiation, and clonal expansion. Preparation for cell division requires not only synthesis of nucleotide pools and new protein but also increases in phospholipid (PL)1 content and remodeling of existing PL in support of new membrane formation (1Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20219-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that changes in membrane PL (1Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20219-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 2Jackowski S. J. Biol.

Acta. 1982; 688: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) occur during the cell cycle. More specifically, mitogen activation of lymphocytes is accompanied by an increase in fatty acid turnover and an enrichment of PL with AA, the major substrate of proinflammatory eicosanoids (3Goppelt M. Kohler L. Resch K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 833: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Rode H.N. Szamel M. Schneider S. Resch K. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. 1981; 115: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The AA comes from internal pools since the enrichment occurs in serum-free conditions (3Goppelt M. Kohler L. Resch K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 833: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Rode H.N. Szamel M. Schneider S. Resch K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The fact that this phenomenon, requiring deacylation-reacylation of PL, is AA specific and targeted toward selected PL classes (e.g. phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol) suggests regulation through specific enzyme systems (4Rode H.N. Szamel M. Schneider S. Resch K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Indeed, the lysophosphatide acyltransferase, a reacylating enzyme, preferentially incorporates polyunsaturated fatty acid (i.e. AA) into membrane PL. The molecular mechanism regulating these events is not fully elucidated. It is conceivable that the family of enzymes which catalyze the acylhydrolysis of fatty acid from the sn-2 position of membrane PL, namely the phospholipase(s) A2 (PLA2) would be important.The two best characterized mammalian PLA2 enzymes, are the calcium-dependent 14-kDa PLA2 (types IIa, V and X) and 85-kDa PLA2 (type IV) (7Mayer R.J. Marshall L.A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The 14-kDa PLA2(s) exist as extracellular forms in inflammatory fluids (8Kramer R.M. Hession C. Johansen B.

The cytosolic 85-kDa PLA2 is structurally distinct and unlike the 14-kDa PLA2(s) exhibits a preference for AA in the sn-2 position of PL and is regulated by physiological intracellular Ca2+concentrations and phosphorylation (14Clark J.D.

We and others have shown that both the 14- and 85-kDa enzymes are induced by inflammatory cytokines and growth factors (17Schalkwijk C. de Vet E. Pfeilschifter J. van den Bosch H. Eur. J.

More recently, a calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) has been cloned from Chinese hamster ovary cells, murine P388D1 macrophages, and a human B cell line (25Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seeehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 26Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Jones S.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Although little data exists regarding its function, antisense depletion of the murine iPLA2 caused inhibition of AA incorporation into membrane PL with or without stimulation but did not affect receptor-coupled arachidonate mobilization suggesting a housekeeping role for this enzyme in basal PL remodeling in P388D1 macrophages (28Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29317-29321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Conversely, studies by Ramanadham and co-workers (29Ramanadham S. Hsu F-F. Bohrer A. Ma Z. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13915-13927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) demonstrated the lack of a role for iPLA2 in islet cell remodeling.The potential contribution of these distinct enzymes in regulating cellular proliferation has only begun to be examined. The prevalence of these three enzymes in B or T lymphocyte populations is still under investigation and their potential involvement in lymphocyte proliferative processes is not known. Herein, we assess the presence of the PLA2 isoforms in purified human monocytes, B cells and T cells and/or in Jurkat T cells through enzymatic assays, ELISA, and Western analysis. We demonstrate the presence of iPLA2 in peripheral blood B and T cells and the Jurkat T leukemia cell line. We then evaluate both the effects of isoform selective PLA2inhibitors as well as antisense technology on Jurkat and mitogen-induced (phytohemagglutinin; PHA) PBL proliferation and cell cycle progression. Both iPLA2 inhibition and depletion of iPLA2 protein using antisense demonstrates that this enzyme plays a key role in lymphocyte proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Isolation and CultureMixed Lymphocyte IsolationHuman monocyte-depleted peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from whole blood as described previously (30Roshak A.K. Anderson K.A. Holmes S.D. Jonak Z. Bolognese B. Terrett J. Marshall L.A. J. Leuk. Biol. 1999; 65: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The resultant population was greater than 85% pure lymphocytes as assessed by differential staining. Cells were resuspended to 2 × 106/ml and cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum unless otherwise noted.Purification of Human Monocytes, B or T LymphocytesHuman peripheral blood leukocytes (buffy coat) were isolated from whole blood as described previously and a greater than 95% pure population of human monocytes was obtained by separation over a Ficoll gradient followed by adherence (2 h) as described previously (12Marshall L.A. Roshak A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Roshak A.K. Sathe G. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25999-26005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified B cells from human spleen were isolated through positive immunomagnetic selection using magnetic polystyrene beads coated with monoclonal antibody to the B cell-restricted membrane antigen, CD19 (Dynabeads M-450 Pan-B (CD19), Dynal Lake Success, NY) as described previously (30Roshak A.K. Anderson K.A. Holmes S.D. Jonak Z. Bolognese B. Terrett J. Marshall L.A. J. Leuk. Biol. 1999; 65: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Purified human peripheral blood T lymphocytes were obtained by separation over T cell enrichment columns, HTCC (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), as per the manufacturer's instructions. The Jurkat T cell leukemia was acquired from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The cells were maintained at a density of 1 to 5 × 105 cells/ml and grown as suspension cultures in RPMI 1640 with 2 mml-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter NaHCO3, and 10% fetal bovine serum.Chemical Cell Cycle Arrest and FACS Analysis of Jurkat T LymphocytesCells were chemically arrested at G1/S, S, or G2/M using established protocols (31Brooks R. Fantes P. The Cell Cycle: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 1-22Google Scholar). Jurkat cells at 5 × 105/ml were treated with either 3 mmhydroxyurea for 16 h to give a G1/S phase arrest or 0.1 μg/ml nocodazole for 12 h to achieve a G2/M phase arrest. In addition, cells were also treated with 2 mm thymidine for 17 h, released for 6 h in culture media (no thymidine), then retreated with 2 mmthymidine for 15 h to allow for a broad S-phase arrest. The specific cell cycle phase arrest of the individual populations was verified by measuring the fluorescence intensities using a Becton-Dickinson FACSTAR Plus. Briefly, following the treatments, the cells were centrifuged, the media was removed, and the cells were resuspended in 750 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. To fix the cells, 2 ml of 95% ethanol (−20 °C) was added and cells were then washed twice with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of a solution containing 250 μg/ml propidium iodide and 250 μg/ml RNase A. The stained cells were vortexed, then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in darkness prior to FACS evaluation of cell cycle phase. Forward scatter versus side light scatter and fluorescent area versus width were used to gate for intact, single cells. Results were based on 20,000 gated cell events.Subcellular FractionationCell pellets were resuspended to 1 × 108cells/0.5 ml in homogenization buffer containing 0.34 msucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μmleupeptin, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin at 4 °C. The cell suspension was disrupted on ice by sonication (5 s) with a Bransonic probe tip and the homogenate was centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and debris. The resulting supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to obtain a supernatant (cytosol) and particulate fraction. The particulate fraction was resuspended in homogenization buffer and both fractions were flash frozen with liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C until analysis.ELISA Analysis of Type II 14-kDa PLA2Cell fractions were assessed for 14-kDa PLA2 mass using a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (22Marshall L.A. Bolognese B.J. Winkler J.D. Roshak A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 759-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This ELISA recognizes both the Type IIa and Type V 14-kDa PLA2 but not the Type X 14-kDa PLA2.Immunoblot AnalysisCell cytosols (50–100 μg of protein) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% Tris glycine gels, Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper, incubated with either rabbit anti-rh 85-kDa PLA2 antiserum (1:500) or rabbit anti-iPLA2 antiserum (1:500; Caymen Chemical) and then incubated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:3000; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Detection of immunoreactive bands was carried out using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the rh 85-kDa PLA2 was prepared as described previously (23Roshak A.K. Sathe G. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25999-26005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Phospholipase A2 Enzyme AssaysCalcium-dependent PLA2 activity was routinely measured by the acylhydrolysis of [3H]AAEscherichia coli as described previously (12Marshall L.A. Roshak A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture (50 μl total volume) contained 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, and 100 μm[3H]AA-labeled E. coli (5 nmol of lipid phosphorus (Pi) per assay. The assay was initiated by addition of substrate and assays were incubated at 37 °C for a time predetermined to be on the linear portion of a time versushydrolysis plot. Calcium-independent PLA2 activity was measured by the acylhydrolysis of a Triton X-100 (400 μm), 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (50 μm; 56 Ci/mol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) mixed micelle according to published methods (26Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Jones S.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8576-8580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition to the substrate, the reaction mixture contained 100 μg of cell fraction, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm ATP. The reaction was initiated by the addition of substrate and allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 60 min. Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) vehicle or drug was added as no greater than 10% of the total assay volume. All drugs or vehicle were added 10 min prior to substrate addition unless otherwise stated. Both reactions were terminated by the addition of 1.0 ml of tetrahydrofuran. Free fatty acid was exclusively separated by elution of the sample over aminopropyl solid phase silica columns with tetrahydrofuran/acetic acid (49:1) and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting as described previously (12Marshall L.A. Roshak A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Cellular ProliferationHuman PBL or Jurkat T cells were resuspended to 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and 200 μl of the suspension was added to each well of a Nunc 96-well cell culture plate. Drug or Me2SO vehicle (0.05%) was added to cells for 15 min at 27 °C prior to the addition of PHA (30 μg/ml for PBL cultures) and incubation for 72 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. [3H]Thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Wilmington, DE) was diluted in RPMI 1640 and 0.1 μCi/well was added to the cells for 6 h prior to harvesting. Plates were harvested using a Packard Filtermate 196 cell harvester onto Packard Unifilter GF/C filter plates. Scintillation fluid was added and filters were quantitated using a Packard Topcount Microplate counter. For antisense studies, PBLs were exposed to initiation site-directed antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides SB8603 (5′-aaggcgtccgaactgcat-3′) or SB 8604 (5′-aaggcggccaaggaactgcat-3′), a scrambled control oligonucleotide, SB8606 (5′-cggggaggacgctagacgatc-3′), an unrelated control oligonucleotide SB9030 (tccgaaggcagaaaggcttca-3′) or LipofectAMINE vehicle alone (5 μg/ml) for 24 h at 37 °C prior to stimulation with PHA (30 μg/ml) for an additional 72 h. Cell viability was monitored using either trypan blue exclusion or the Cytotox 96 Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) for all studies.Apoptosis MeasurementApoptosis was measured by TUNEL (32Anderson K.A. Roshak A.K. Winkler J.D. McCord M. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30504-30511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using the Promega ApopTag kit (Madison, WI) as per the manufacturer's directions. In brief, the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase extends the DNA fragments with digoxigenin-containing nucleotides, which are then detected with a anti-digoxigenin antibody carrying fluorescein to allow detection by fluorescence (494 nm excitation, 523 nm emission). Propidium iodide was used as a counterstain to measure total DNA content and determine distribution of cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan instrument using CellQuest software.Protein DeterminationAll protein concentrations were determined by Bradford protein analysis kits (Bio-Rad).Calculations and StatisticsData are expressed as mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations unless otherwise stated. All experiments were conducted 2–4 times using cells obtained from different donors.DISCUSSIONLipid metabolism is an integral process of immune cell blast formation and proliferation. In the present study, we show that both freshly isolated T and B lymphocytes and cell lines (e.g.Jurkat T leukemia cells) possess low levels of Ca2+-dependent PLA2 activity but are devoid of 85-kDa PLA2 protein. Moreover, we show for the first time, that these three cell types possess Ca2+-independent PLA2 protein and activity and demonstrate that it is this enzyme which appears to be critical for lymphocyte proliferation.Consistent with recent reports, Western analysis of peripheral blood T and B lymphocyte cytosols confirmed the lack of the 85-kDa PLA2 protein in these cells. The existence of 85-kDa PLA2 mRNA and protein has been reported in activated thymocytes and immature B cells, but it is not present and its expression cannot be induced in mature B or T cells or several lines suggesting a maturation-specific phenomenon (35Gilbert J.J. Stewart A. Courtney C. Fleming M.-C. Reid P. Jackson C.G. Wise A. Wakelam M.J.O. Harnett M.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 156: 2054-2061Google Scholar). The type IIa 14-kDa PLA2 mRNA is found in lymphoid tissue, such as human tonsil (8Kramer R.M. Hession C. Johansen B. Hayes G. McGray P. Chow E.P. Tizard R. Pepinski R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5768-5775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and spleen (17Schalkwijk C. de Vet E. Pfeilschifter J. van den Bosch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 248: 1-8Google Scholar), and protein has been demonstrated in a number of cell lines including platelets and neutrophils. However, its existence in purified B and T lymphocytes has not been described. More recently, a second 14-kDa PLA2, type V, has been identified in mast cells and the P388D1 murine macrophage cell line but a detailed analysis of its expression in human lymphocytes has not been conducted (36Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2365-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Reddy S. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.J. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13591-13596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the present study, ELISA analysis of PBL and Jurkat particulate fractions showed low but detectable levels of a 14-kDa PLA2 protein. Subsequent RT-PCR analysis demonstrated this to be the type V PLA2 isoform, a finding which has not been previously reported. Expression of iPLA2mRNA was recently reported in human granulocytes and CD34+ stem cells as well as the promyelocytic cell line, HL60, and the monoclonal B cell line, Raji (38Pontus K.A. Forsell L. Runarsson G. Ibrahim M. Bjorkholm M. Claesson H.-E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To date, however, no reports exist regarding the occurrence of iPLA2 mRNA or protein in primary human B or T lymphocytes or human monocytes. We clearly demonstrate the presence of iPLA2 protein in the cytosol of purified human T and B cells but not in human monocytes.Enzymatic evaluation of iPLA2 activity in human PBL and Jurkat T cells revealed proliferation and cell cycle dependent expression. In PBL, exposure to the T cell mitogen, PHA, over 72 h was associated with the maintenance of iPLA2 protein levels, resulting in activity equal to that observed in freshly isolated cells. Alternatively, the absence of such a stimulus coincided with a decrease in iPLA2 activity and protein levels. This data indicated a potential requirement for the iPLA2 enzyme when cells are stimulated to transition from quiesence (G0) to G1 where proliferative responses are initiated. Interestingly, assessment of iPLA2 activity in cell cycle arrested Jurkat fractions demonstrated a predominance of activity in the G2/M phase arrested fractions which may be due to an increase in protein or an enhanced enzymatic rate. While very little is known about PL metabolism at G2/M, this coincides with the reported destruction and reassembly of the nuclear membrane which occurs in cells preparing for mitotic events (1Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20219-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As entry and progression through the cell cycle is associated with lipid turnover (2Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these data implicate iPLA2 as having a possible regulatory role in cell division.To more directly address this hypothesis, two strategies were employed: (a) use of available inhibitors of the various PLA2 isoforms and (b) utilization of initiation site-directed antisense oligonucleotides. The use of PLA2inhibitors has been employed in numerous cell types to investigate the contributions of distinct PLA2 family members in cellular AA metabolism. The participation of the type IIa 14-kDa PLA2 in eicosanoid and platelet activating factor production has been investigated in a host of inflammatory cells including monocytes, neutrophils, and mast cells through the use of the structurally distinct 14-kDa PLA2 inhibitors,e.g. scalardial (21Marshall L.A. Winkler J.D. Griswold D.E. Bolognese B. Roshak A. Sung C.M. Webb E.F. Jacobs R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 709-717PubMed Google Scholar), BMS 181162 (39Tramposch K.M. Chilton F.H. Stanely P.L. Franson R. Havens M.B. Nettleton D.O. Davern L.B. Darling I.M. Bonney R.J. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 852-859PubMed Google Scholar), and the active site-directed inhibitor SB 203347 (34Marshall L.A. Hall R.H. Winkler J.D. Badger A. Bolognese B. Roshak A. Flamberg P.L. Sung C.M. Chabot Fletcher M. Adams J.L. Mayer R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 1254-1262PubMed Google Scholar). The transition state inhibitor AAOCF3 was previously thought to be selective for the 85-kDa PLA2 (40Bartoli F. Lin H.-K. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Jain M.K. Apitz-Castro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15625-15630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but recent studies indicate it also has significant inhibitory activity against the iPLA2 (33Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). BEL, a mechanism based inhibitor, is specific for iPLA2over both the 14-kDa PLA2 and 85-kDa PLA2 (33Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar,41Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and has been successfully used to demonstrate the regulatory role of iPLA2 in phospholipid metabolism (42Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8531Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It should be noted that BEL is also reported to inhibit PA phosphohydrolase (43Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Exposure of both PHA-activated PBL or cultured Jurkats to the iPLA2inhibitors AAOCF3 or BEL, but not the 14-kDa PLA2 inhibitor, SB203347, induced a concentration-dependent suppression of PBL or Jurkat proliferation. Thus, even though 14-kDa PLA2Ca2+ dependent activity exists in these cells, these data would indicate that it does not play a significant role in proliferative processes. Alternatively, we demonstrate that inhibition of iPLA2 activity corresponded with a profound interference of cellular proliferation.Initiation site-directed antisense has been used to demonstrate the critical role of the 85-kDa PLA2 in prostanoid formation in systems such as LPS-induced monocyte (22Marshall L.A.

https://openalex.org/W2069258137,"The main protein of the hemolymph of the cattle tick Boophilus microplus has been isolated and shown to be a heme lipoprotein (HeLp). HeLp has an apparent molecular mass of 354,000 and contains two apoproteins (103 and 92 kDa) found in equal amounts. HeLp presents a pI of 5.8 and a density of 1.28 g/ml and contains 33% lipids, containing both neutral lipids and phospholipids, and 3% of sugars. A remarkable feature of HeLp is the abundance of cholesterol ester (35% of total lipids), a lipid not previously reported in invertebrate lipoproteins. Western blot analysis showed HeLp in hemolymph from adult females and males, but not in eggs. Although HeLp contains 2 heme molecules, it is capable of binding 6 additional molecules of heme. Boophilus feeds large amount of blood, and we recently showed that this tick is unable to performde novo synthesis of heme (Braz, G. R. C., Coelho, H. S. L., Masuda, H., and Oliveira, P. L. (1999)Curr. Biol. 9, 703–706). Injection of tick females with55Fe-labeled heme-HeLp indicated that this protein transports heme from hemolymph to tissues.

Am. J. Med. Sci. 1999; 318: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to all these beneficial features, heme is a powerful catalyst of the formation of reactive oxygen species, mainly by means of Fenton type reaction (2Sadrzadeh S.M.H. Graf E. Panter S.S.

In fact, there are several reports of heme-induced oxidative damage to a broad range of biomolecules as lipoproteins, which are especially susceptible to lipid peroxidation driven by heme (4Sadrzadeh S.M.H.

As described in the literature, heme transport and recycling does not occur in eukaryotic cells where the heme delivered to cells is degraded by heme oxygenase (1Ponka P. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1999; 318: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Noyer C.M. Immenschuh S. Liem H.H. Muller-Eberhard U. Wolkoff A.W. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Hematophagous arthropods usually ingest large amounts of vertebrate blood, comprising several times their own weight (13Lehane M.J. Biology of Blood - sucking Insects. Harper Collins Publications, London1991Crossref Google Scholar). The blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus has a heme-binding protein in the hemolymph that protects the insect from heme induced lipid peroxidation (14Oliveira P.L. Kawooya J.K. Ribeiro J.M.C. Meyer T. Poorman R. Alves E.W. Walker F.A. Machado E.A. Nussenzveig R.H. Padovan G.J. Masuda H. J. Biol.

In the case of cattle tick,Boophilus microplus, blood is the sole food source for all developmental stages and, during the last 48 h before dropping from the host, adult females may ingest as much as 100 times their weight in blood (16Sonenshine D.E. Biology of Ticks. 2. Oxford University Press, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). We recently showed that Boophilus is an exception to the generally accepted statement that all eukaryotic cells synthesize their own heme (17Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This tick does not have a functional heme synthesis pathway and thus must rely exclusively on the heme obtained from digestion of the vertebrate blood in order to make its own heme-proteins (18Braz G.R.C. Coelho H.S.L. Masuda H. Oliveira P.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 703-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The heme biosynthetic pathway is also defective in some pathogenic bacteria that depend on host blood as a heme source, and proteins involved in heme transport have an essential role in the recovery of heme (19Craig Lee B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The dependence of the tick on heme from its diet requires the development of mechanisms for heme absorption, transport, and recycling, which have not been described for any other multicellular organisms. In this article we describe the isolation and characterization of a major heme-lipoprotein (HeLp), from the hemolymph of the cattle tick, which is capable of binding additional heme and transport it to tick tissues. Ticks were from Porto Alegre strain of B. microplus, free of Babesia spp., and were reared on calves obtained from a tick-free area. The colony is maintained at the Faculdade de Veterinária at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Engorged adult females were kept in Petri dishes at 28 °C and 80% humidity until completion of oviposition and death, for about 12 days. Hemolymph was collected between the 5th and 8th days after dropping from the bovine with a glass microcapillary pipette by puncturing the cuticle with a needle and applying gentle pressure to the tick abdomen. Hemolymph was mixed with a collecting solution (1:1, v/v) containing 0.15 mNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (0.05 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.05 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 2.5 mm pepstatin. The solution was centrifuged at room temperature for 5 min at 13,000 ×g, and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was stored at −70 °C until HeLp isolation. Experiments in vivo were carried out with fully engorged females, at the 4th day after dropping. The hemolymph mixed with collecting solution (2 ml) was diluted 10 times in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, and applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl column (15 × 2 cm), equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–300 mm), and fractions containing HeLp (identified by absorbance at 400 nm and by SDS-PAGE)1 were pooled, diluted 10 times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.15 mNaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4), and applied to an agarose-iminodiacetic acid metal ion affinity column (Sigma) loaded with CuSO4 (IDA-Cu2+). After elution with a glycine gradient (0–300 mm), fractions (1.5 ml) containing HeLp were pooled and dialyzed against PBS. Protein concentrations were measured according to Lowry et al. (20Lowry H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out in 5–22.5% acrylamide gradient gels (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). Gels were run at 120 V at room temperature for approximately 90 min, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G, according to Neuhoff et al.(22Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhadt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2350) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of polypeptides in SDS-PAGE was determined using the following proteins as standards: myosin (205 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylase b (97 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), α-lactalbumin (14.2 kDa). Pore-limiting native PAGE was performed as described by Blancheet al. (23Blanche P.J. Gong E.L. Forte T.M. Nichols A.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 665: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), using 5–22.5% acrylamide gradient gels, and the electrophoresis was performed for 20 h. The native molecular mass of was determined using the following proteins as standards: tireoglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa). For NH2-terminal sequencing, purified HeLp (0.5 nmol) was submitted to SDS-PAGE (7.5%) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (24Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HeLp bands and the higher molecular mass aggregate were cut and sequenced by automatic Edman degradation using a liquid phase sequencer (Porton PI 2020/2090) with a Hewlett Packard high performance liquid chromatograph and a reverse phase AminoQuant analytical column (2.1 × 250 mm). Homology searches in protein data bases (GenBank, SWISS-PROT, and EMBL) were performed. The amino acid composition was determined for total HeLp protein moiety. Samples were hydrolyzed in constant boiling (150 °C) in the presence of 6 n HCl, for 90 min under N2atmosphere. Samples were analyzed as described by Spackman et al. (25Spackman D.H. Stein W.J. Moore S. Anal. Biochem. 1958; 30: 1190-1206Google Scholar) on a Shimadzu automated instrument. Amino acid detection was made by post column o-phthalaldialdehyde derivatives. Purified HeLp (2–4 mg of protein) was dialyzed against water, dried in a vacuum centrifuge (Speed-Vac, Savant SC110) and weighted. Lipids were extracted with chloroform-methanol-water (2:1:0.5; v/v) (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42681) Google Scholar), and the organic phase containing lipids and the protein pellet were dried under a N2 stream and weighed to determine the lipid content. Lipids were analyzed by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) on Silica gel 60 plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Plates were first developed in chloroform-methanol-acetone-acetic acid-water (40:13:15:12:8, by volume) until the solvent front reached the middle of the plate, for separation of phospholipids (27Horwitz J. Perlman R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 141: 169-175Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and then in hexane-ethyl ether-acetic acid (60:40:1, by volume), for separation of neutral lipids (28Kawooya J.K. Law J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8748-8753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HPTLC plates were stained by spraying with sulfuric acid (30%) and heating at 120 °C for 10–15 min (29Morris K. Techniques of Lipidology. North-Holland, Amsterdan1972Google Scholar). Quantification of different lipids was performed by computer scanning and analysis of stained HPTLC plates with the Quantiscan software (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Quantification of different lipids was performed by computer scanning and analysis of stained HPTLC plates with the Quantiscan software (Biosoft). Total reducing sugar content was determined according to the method of Du Bois (30Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40620) Google Scholar). To analyze carbohydrate composition, 2 mg of HeLp was submitted to acid hydrolysis (6 n trifluoroacetic acid, 100 °C for 5 h) and sugars were fractionated by paper chromatography using butanol/pyridine/water (3:2:1, v/v) as solvent (31Mourão P.A.S. Assreuy A.M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3132-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Light absorption spectra of native HeLp were obtained in PBS using a GBC-920 spectrophotometer (Victoria, Australia). Heme content was determined from the reduced minus oxidized spectra of the pyridine alkaline derivative (32Falk J.E. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsevier Publishing Co., Amsterdam1964Google Scholar). Density of the HeLp particle was determined by KBr gradient (1.16–1.35 g/ml, 10 ml) ultracentrifugation using a 50Ti Beckman rotor (20 h at 4 °C, 45,000 rpm) using the conditions described by Shipman et al. (33Shipman B.A. Ryan R.O. Schmidt J.O Law J.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 26: 1885-1889Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Refraction index and absorbance at 280 nm of the gradient fractions were determined, and samples were submitted to a SDS-PAGE. Isoelectric point of HeLp was determined in a pre-cast isoelectric focusing gel (Ampholine PAGplate, pH 3.5–9.5; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Samples used for mass spectrometry analysis were total lipid extracts or lipids eluted from the HPTLC plate (with chloroform:methanol, 1:1). Lipids were dissolved in chloroform:methanol (1:1), containing 10 mmammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid. Spectra were obtained in a Finnigan LCQDuo ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan, ThermoQuest Inc., San Jose, CA). Samples were introduced into the electrospray source by injection through a 50 μm fused silica capillary at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. ESI capillary voltage was set to 36–46 V, and temperature to 250 °C. Spectra were acquired at 3 s/scan over a mass range ofm/z 150–2000. Collision-induced (ES-MS/MS) fragmentation of parent ions was carried at relative collisional energy from 25 to 35 V. Source parameters were optimized using cholesterol, cholesteryl oleate, triacylglycerol (triolein), phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine standards at 7–70 pmol/μl each, all purchased from Sigma. HeLp (1 mg) was emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant and injected subcutaneously in the back of a rabbit. Boosters of 0.5–1.0 mg were injected at 2-month intervals, and blood was collected from an ear vein 3 months after the first injection. Western blots were performed according to Towbin et al. (34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44891) Google Scholar). Binding of heme to HeLp (1 μm, 1 ml) was followed by adding a solution of 0.5 mm hemin in 0.01 m NaOH and following the absorbance at 411 nm, the hemin isosbestic point (35Tipping E. Ketterer B. Christodoulides L. Enderby G. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hemin bound to HeLp has a higher molar extinction coefficient than hemin in aqueous buffer. Plotting the absorbance against the amount of added hemin reveals binding as a steeper initial part of the curve, and saturation of binding sites is determined by the intersection with a second component of the curve, which is parallel to hemin added to buffer. Alternatively, HeLp can be observed in a native PAGE gel without staining, due to its heme content. This allowed direct visualization of binding by adding 1 mm hemin in 0.1 m NaOH to purified HeLp (50 μg) or crude hemolymph (1 μl), applying the samples to a pore-limiting PAGE as described above and recording the gels with a computer scan. Radiolabeled 55Fe-heme was synthesized as described by Galbraith et al. (36Galbraith R.A. Sassa S. Kappas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12198-12202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HeLp was incubated with 55Fe-heme at 1:1 molar ratio and passed through spin columns (37Penefsky H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 55Fe-Heme-HeLp (5 μl, 9000 CPM) was injected into the hemocoel of female tick, and animals were maintained at 28 °C or 4 °C. Hemolymph and ovaries were collected after different times, and radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. Isolation of HeLp was achieved by means of a DEAE-Toyopearl column, followed by chromatography in an IDA-Cu2+ column (Fig. 1,A and B). The native molecular mass of HeLp, determined by pore-limit PAGE, was 342 kDa (Fig. 1 C), a value close to the 365 kDa obtained by gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography (data not shown). Therefore, an average molecular mass of 354 kDa is assumed hereafter. HeLp is composed by two apoproteins of 103 kDa (apoHeLp-A) and 92 kDa (apoHeLp-B), as judged by SDS-PAGE of the purified lipoprotein (Fig. 1 D). The native PAGE profile showed that HeLp is the main hemolymphatic protein (Fig.1 C), and estimation of its concentration in the hemolymph by radial immunodiffusion showed titers around 50 mg/ml throughout adult development (data not shown). The apoproteins were found in a stoichiometry of 1:1, as judged by densitometry of the gel. Fig.2 shows the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of 103- and 92-kDa apoproteins, obtained by Edman degradation. Homology searches did not indicate significant similarity to known proteins. The higher molecular mass protein bands in the SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1 D) were shown to be aggregates of both polypeptides, as protein sequencing of its NH2-terminal portion resulted in a combination of both apoprotein sequences.Figure 2NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. The NH2-terminal sequence was determined by automated Edman degradation as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Western blot using antiserum against purified HeLp showed that HeLp was not sex-specific (Fig. 3), being found in hemolymph from males (lane 1), fully engorged females (lane 2), and partially engorged adult females (collected before dropping from cattle) (lane 3). Plasma lipoproteins from both insects and vertebrates frequently are incorporated into yolk of developing oocytes, as it is the case of avian low density lipoprotein (38George R. Barner D.L. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16838-16847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or lipophorin, the main lipoprotein of insect hemolymph (39Kawooya J.K. Osir E. Law J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8740-8747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, HeLp was not found in mature Boophilus eggs by Western blot (Fig. 3,lane 4), despite the high titer present in the hemolymph. The amino acid composition of HeLp is very similar to an eukaryotic average protein (40Doolittle R.F. Of Urfs and Orfs : A Primer on How to Analyze Derived Amino Acid Sequences. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1986Google Scholar), except for a rather low isoleucine content (TableI). HeLp isoelectric point was pH 5.8. HeLp carbohydrate content was 3% (w/w), and mannose was the most abundant component (>90%; data not shown), a feature shared with most arthropod glycoproteins, where high mannose type oligosaccharides with a low degree of trimming are the general pattern (41Kanost M.R. Kawooya J.K. Law J.H. Ryan R.D. Van Heusden M.C. Ziegler R. Adv. Insect. Physiol. 1990; 22: 299-396Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Purified HeLp has approximately 33% of lipids (55% neutral lipids and 44% phospholipids) (Table II and Fig.4 A). The most unusual trait of HeLp, concerning its lipid moiety, was the presence of high amounts of cholesterol ester (34.7% of the total lipid content). Therefore, a more detailed characterization of HeLp lipid composition was performed by ES-MS and ES-MS/MS. Pseudomolecular ion species showing higher relative intensity in the positive-ion mode spectrum of HeLp total lipid extract were assigned as cholesterol oleate (m/z686.5 = [M + 2NH4]+), phosphatidylcholine (m/z 780.5 = 16:2/20:4-PC, [M+]; m/z 782.5 = 16:0/20:4-PC, [M+]; m/z 788.5 = 18:0/18:1-PC, [M+]; m/z 808.5, 18:1/20:4-PC, [M+]; 810.5 = 18:0/20:4-PC, [M+]), phosphatidylethanolamine (m/z 748.5 = 18:0/18:0-phosphatidylethanolamine; m/z 796.4 = 18:0/22:4-phosphatidylethanolamine) and triacylglycerol (m/z907.5 = 18:0/18:0/18:1-triacylglycerol, [M + NH4]+; m/z 909.6 = 18:0/18:0/18:0-triacylglycerol, [M + NH4]+; and m/z 937.3 = 18:0/18:0/20:0-triacylglycerol, [M + NH4]+) (Fig. 4 B). Based on previous data (42Kerwin J.L. Tuininga A.R. Ericsson L.H. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1102-1114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Duffin K. Obukowicz M. Raz A. Shieh J.J. Anal.

Lipids. 1999; 100: 127-138Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and on the collision-induced dissociation daughter-ion spectra (data not shown) of the pseudomolecular ion species above, we were able to confirm the proposed assignments. The pseudomolecular ion species at m/z 663.4 most probably is an oxidized form of cholesterol oleate, which we were unable to assign as a precisely defined oxysterol ester. A true sample of cholesterol oleate (from Sigma, M r = 651.1; m/z 668.5 = [M + NH4]+) was partially converted tom/z 663.4 ion species when submitted to an air stream for 2 h (data not shown). The pseudomolecular ion species atmz 663.5 was also found in lipid extracts from crude hemolymph, and its relative intensity increased upon handling of samples during protein isolation and lipid extraction (data not shown). Therefore, the fraction isolated from HPTLC spot migrating as cholesterol ester showed only the m/z 663.4 ion species (Fig. 4 B, inset). In Fig. 4 C(inset), we show that the pseudomolecular ion species atm/z 668.5 ([M + NH4]+) is formed from the ion species m/z 686.5 ([M + 2NH4]+). Fragmentation of the ion species atm/z 668.5 generated cholesterol-derived daughter ion species at m/z 368.3 ([M - C18H33O2 + H]+) and 386.1 ([M - C18H33O + H]+), corresponding to the cleavage at C3-O1 and C1-O1 of cholesterol, respectively (44El Hafidi M. Michel F Bascoul J. Paulet A.C. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 100: 127-138Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). A lower intensity ion species corresponding to the ammonium adduct of oleic acid (m/z 300.3; [C18:1 + NH4]+ was observed, providing definitive identification of cholesterol ester in HeLp. Two other major observed fragments (m/z 467.5 = [M - C7H14 + NH4]+; and 485.5, = [M - C7H14 + 2NH4]+) were derived from the cleavage of the oleic acid moiety, resulting in the loss of 183 mass units from the parent ions at m/z 668.3 and 650.3 (Fig. 4 C). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a cholesterol ester-rich lipoprotein in invertebrates. A density of 1.29 g/ml was determined by KBr gradient ultracentrifugation, a value that is higher than those reported for the more dense forms of high density lipoprotein, the mammalian cholesterol ester-rich lipoprotein, which are about 1.21 g/ml and have a lipid content of about 50% (45Chapman M.J.

Open table in a new tab The amino acid composition was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Analysis of HeLp secondary structure by circular dichroism (data not shown) showed a spectrum that suggests a reduced amount of α-helix when compared with mammalian high density lipoprotein apoproteins (46Jonas A. Steinmetz A. Churgay L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1596-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HeLp CD spectrum resembles those of insect lipophorins, which are characterized by a high proportion of β-sheet (47Monteiro C.M Oliveira P.L. Gondim K.C. Masuda H. Ferreira S.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11216-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 48Kawooya J.K. Wells M.A Law J.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6658-6667Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, despite this common feature, other aspects suggest that HeLp is a distinct particle, such as the absence of cholesterol ester in lipophorins, where diacylglycerol is the most abundant neutral lipid (49Soulages J.L. Wells M.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 371-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, lipophorins from all insect species have a very conserved quaternary structure, with one apoprotein of 220–240 kDa and another with 70–80 kDa (49Soulages J.L. Wells M.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 371-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), distinct from HeLp-A and HeLp-B. Nevertheless, a more detailed structural characterization of HeLp, including complete apoprotein sequence, will be necessary to exclude similarity to insect or vertebrate lipoproteins. The most remarkable characteristic of HeLp when compared with all other known lipoproteins is the presence of about 2 mol of heme/mol of HeLp (Table II). As can be seen in Fig.4 A, there is some amount of heme that is recovered together with lipids, and is separated by the HPTLC system, but the majority remains at the aqueous phase. HeLp visible absorption spectrum was clearly that of a hemeprotein, showing a characteristic peak at 398 nm (Fig. 5). However, the HeLp Soret bandwidth (about 80 nm) was unusually large when compared with other hemeproteins such as cytochromes and hemoglobin, which are typically in the range of 40–50 nm, thus suggesting the existence of multiple quantum states of the heme molecules in HeLp. Spectral profiles similar to that of HeLp were reported for albumin-bound heme, for heme bound to phospholipid membranes, and for heme in organic solvents such as Me2SO (50Beaven G.H. Chen S. D'Albis A. Gratzer W.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 41: 530-546Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 51Cannon J.B. Kuo F.S. Pasternack R.F. Wong N.M. Muller-Eberhard U. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3715-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Heme has been implicated in oxidative damage to membrane phospholipids and to lipoproteins such as vertebrate low density lipoprotein (4Sadrzadeh S.M.H. Anderson D.K., E. Panter S.S. Hallaway P.E. Eaton J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 662-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 5Vincent S.H. Semin. Hematol. 1989; 26: 105-113PubMed Google Scholar, 6Miller Y.I. Felikman Y. Shaklai N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1272: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Lipophorin from the blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus also was shown to be damaged by heme-promoted oxidation (10Eskew J.D. Vanacoret R.M. Sung L. Morales P.J. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 638-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and, in this case, one of the antioxidant mechanisms described was a heme-binding protein that renders the heme molecule redox inactive, thus avoiding the production of free radicals. Besides having two heme molecules bound, purified HeLp was capable of binding additional heme. This can be directly observed by the intensification of the HeLp band in native page without staining when it was incubated with hemin (Fig.6 A). The same experiment was carried out with crude hemolymph, showing that the binding of heme by HeLp was not an artifact generated during isolation of the protein (Fig. 6 A). Moreover, only HeLp showed up in the gel after addition of heme, indicating that it is the main heme-binding protein in the hemolymph of the tick. Spectrophotometric titration of the heme-binding sites of purified HeLp revealed that each molecule of HeLp can bind up to six additional molecules of heme (Fig. 6 B). Binding of these extra heme molecules did not altered HeLp far UV circular dichroism spectrum (data not shown), similar to results found for binding of heme by vertebrate albumin (52Solar I. Shaklai N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 983: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The interactions of HeLp heme with its lipid and protein moieties, as well as its possible antioxidant role, are currently under study in our laboratory. In mammals, the intracellular pool of heme is controlled in order to keep equilibrium between synthesis and degradation (1Ponka P. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1999; 318: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Boophilus microplus is not able to synthesize its own heme; therefore, we suggest that an obligatory counterpart of tick dependence on heme from its host should be the development of efficient ways to absorb heme from the midgut and transport this molecule to tissues. In mammals, there are two proteins involved in extracellular heme transport: hemopexin and albumin (12Noyer C.M. Immenschuh S. Liem H.H. Muller-Eberhard U. Wolkoff A.W. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As HeLp is the main heme-protein in the hemolymph, it would be a candidate to act as a vehicle in transport of heme to tissues. Oogenesis is the main event occurring in B. microplus adult females and tick eggs contain a large amount of heme, which gives then their characteristic deep brown color (13Lehane M.J. Biology of Blood - sucking Insects. Harper Collins Publications, London1991Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, HeLp labeled with 55Fe-heme was injected into the hemocoel of female ticks, and radioactivity at hemolymph and ovaries were accompanied (Fig. 7). In panel A we observed that radioactivity quickly decreased in the hemolymph after injection, in parallel to incorporation by the ovaries (panel B). Ticks maintained at 4 °C after injection did not show either ovarian uptake nor hemolymph clearance, suggesting dependence on active metabolism. Taken together, our data indicate that HeLp plays a key role in the transport and recycling of heme in the tick, featuring as a major biochemical adaptation to blood feeding. We are currently looking for intracellular proteins involved in the uptake and reutilization of heme by tick tissues. Besides elucidating an important aspect in the biology of ticks, heme reutilization mechanisms could be targets in the development of control methods specifically directed toward hematophagous animals.

Tandem mass spectrometric sequencing and immunoblotting demonstrated that Shc was the primary protein binding to phosphorylated β3.

Moreover, Shc was co-immunoprecipitated with tyrosine-phosphorylated β3 in detergent lysates of aggregated platelets. Using purified, recombinant protein, it was found that the binding of Shc to monophosphorylated (C-terminal tyrosine) and diphosphorylated β3 peptides was direct, demonstrating Shc recognition motifs on phospho-β3. Aggregation-induced Shc phosphorylation was also observed to be robust in platelets from wild-type mice, but not in those from mice expressing (Y747F,Y759F) β3, which are defective in outside-in αIIbβ3 signaling.

Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar). αIIbβ3 is the most prominent platelet integrin, and is capable of binding several adhesive proteins, including fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor, the binding of which mediates platelet aggregation (3Shattil S.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). During platelet aggregation, αIIbβ3 is also involved in transmitting signals, so-called “outside-in” αIIbβ3signaling. Outside-in αIIbβ3 signaling initiates subsequent platelet responses, including various signaling reactions, changes in the platelet cytoskeleton, and platelet secretion (4Zhang J. Zhang J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The high degree of homology within the integrin family, for example between β3 and β1, and the presence of the β3 subunit in the widely distributed αvβ3 integrin, suggest that αIIbβ3 signaling serves as a prototype for the elucidation of signaling pathways within the integrin family of adhesion receptors. Outside-in αIIbβ3 signaling in platelets has been shown to involve the integrin cytoplasmic tyrosine (ICY)1 domain of the cytoplasmic tail of β3 (7Law D. DeGuzman F. Heiser P. Ministi-Madrid K. Killeen N. Phillips D. Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The β3 ICY domain contains two tyrosine sequences, each in an NXXY motif, separated by 11 amino acids. Phosphorylated NXXY motifs in other receptors are known to be recognition sequences for proteins containing phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains (8Van der Geer P. Wiley S. Lai V.K. Olivier J.P. Gish G.D. Stephens R. Kaplan D. Shoelson S. Pawson T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 404-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the ICY domain of β3 occurs during outside-in signaling induced by platelet aggregation, independent of the platelet agonist (9Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 10Jenkins A.L. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Silver D. Sellers J.R. Ginsberg M.H. Law D.A. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13878-13885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The importance of phosphorylation of ICY domain tyrosines has been established through the analysis of platelet function in the diYF mouse, a mutant strain in which the endogenous β3 gene was replaced by one in which the two cytoplasmic tyrosines in β3 (Tyr-747 and Tyr-759) were mutated to phenylalanines. Platelets from the diYF mouse aggregate poorly to low concentrations of thrombin, aggregate reversibly to ADP, and are defective in retracting clots. DiYF mice demonstrate unstable hemostasis, perhaps because of the reversible nature of their platelet aggregates. Given the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation to outside-in αIIbβ3 signaling, characterization of the binding partner(s) of tyrosine-phosphorylated β3 is essential for characterizing the molecular features of this αIIbβ3-mediated signaling event. Moreover, because conserved ICY domain sequences are found in the β subunits of several integrins, including β1, β3, β6, and β7, and because tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be involved in the migration of cells on β1 integrins, it is anticipated that information concerning the mechanisms of signaling through αIIbβ3 might be applicable to other integrins. Previous studies have identified proteins that bind the cytoplasmic tails of αIIbβ3. These proteins include: β3 endonexin (11Shattil S.J. O'Toole T. Eigenthaler M. Thon V. Williams M. Babior B.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), which specifically interacts with the NITY motif at residues 756–759 on the distal end of the β3 cytoplasmic tail (12Eigenthaler M.

In the present study we used affinity chromatography and tandem mass spectrometric sequencing to identify the major soluble platelet protein binding to a diphosphorylated β3 ICY domain cytoplasmic tail peptide. Biochemical and genetic strategies were then used to determine whether the protein identified was involved in outside-in signaling through αIIbβ3. We discovered that Shc was the primary protein associating with the phosphorylated β3 peptide and showed that Shc becomes transiently phosphorylated during platelet aggregation and can be co-immunoprecipitated with β3 from lysates in which outside-in αIIbβ3 signaling occurs. We also found that Shc interacts directly with tyrosine-phosphorylated β3, because a GST-p52Shc fusion protein binds directly to the diphosphorylated β3 peptide sequence and to the β3 peptide sequence monophosphorylated on the C-terminal end. Analysis of platelets from the diYF mouse expressing (Y747F,Y759F) β3 showed that, in platelets where β3tyrosine phosphorylation cannot occur and where outside-in αIIbβ3 signaling is defective, the level of aggregation-induced Shc phosphorylation was abrogated. These data implicate Shc as playing a major role in outside-in αIIbβ3 signaling in platelets by serving as a direct signaling partner for tyrosine-phosphorylated β3. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Protein A (NA 9120) and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (RPN 2106) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG controls (sc-2040) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse GST monoclonal antibody (sc-138 HRP) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; anti-rabbit Shc polyclonal antibodies (sc-1695, s14630) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies and Transduction Laboratories, respectively; anti-Shc antibody sc-1695 was custom biotinylated at Santa Cruz. The anti-mouse phosphotyrosine antibodies PY-20 (P11120) and 4G10 (05-321) were from Transduction Laboratories and Upstate Biotechnology Inc., respectively. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against αIIbβ3 #4518 was from COR Therapeutics, Inc. The anti-LIBS antibody, D3, was the kind gift of Dr. Lisa K. Jennings (University of Tennessee, Memphis). Peptides were synthesized at SynPep Corp. utilizing solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, except for the diphosphorylated, scrambled β3 peptide, and the β3 peptide monophosphorylated on the C-terminal tyrosine residue, both synthesized at Research Genetics. Avidin-agarose beads were purchased from Pierce; glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Human α-thrombin was from Hemetech. Shc (p52) nucleotide sequence, in-frame with the GST sequence in the pGex-3X bacterial expression vector (for expression of GST-p52Shc fusion protein in Escherichia coli), was a kind gift from Drs. Darren Tyson and Ralph A. Bradshaw, University of California at Irvine. Precast SDS gels were from Bio-Rad. For the column preparation, immobilized avidin on 6% cross-linked beaded agarose (1 mg/ml) was pre-equilibrated in 1:1 TBS/1× lysis buffer A (10 mm Tris base, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 μg/ml of both aprotinin and leupeptin), then incubated 12 h (overnight) with the biotinylated β3 peptide (biotin-DTANNPLYKEATSTFTNITYRGT-COOH) or with the diphosphorylated β3 peptide (biotin-DTANNPLpYKEATSTFTNITpYRGT-COOH). Excess peptide was drained off the column material through 1.5- × 12-cm polypropylene columns (Bio-Rad) by gravity filtration. All three types of columns to be used in the purification process,i.e. 20-ml column beds of avidin-agarose, non-phosphorylated, biotin-β3 conjugated to avidin-agarose, or diphosphorylated biotin-β3 conjugated to avidin-agarose, were equilibrated in 1:1 TBS/lysis buffer A. Columns were set up in series, with avidin-agarose as the first, pre-clear column, followed by the non-phosphorylated β3 column, followed by the diphosphorylated β3 column. Human platelets were obtained from volunteers subjected to double platelet pheresis, conducted at the Stanford Blood Center, Palo Alto, CA and used within 2 h of collection. Approximately 5 × 1011 platelets were obtained from each donor. Platelets were washed using CGS buffer (13 mm sodium citrate, 30 mm glucose, 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) and resuspended in 210 ml of calcium/magnesium free Tyrode's Hepes buffer (12 mm NaHCO3, 138 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 2.9 mm KCl, pH 7.4). Platelet suspensions (2.95 ± 0.02 platelets/ml, total volume 170 ± 20 ml) were lysed on ice for 30 min with a 1:1 volume of 2× lysis buffer A. Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove the majority of cytoskeletal proteins. The supernatants were then loaded at a rate of 20 ml/h onto the columns set up in series. Columns were then separated, washed individually with 8 bed volumes of 1:1 TBS/lysis buffer A, pH 7.4, and eluted with 0.8m phenyl phosphate. Samples (12 μl) from fractions were monitored by silver staining of SDS gels and by Western analysis. Fractions containing proteins detected by silver staining and eluting exclusively off the diphosphorylated β3 column were pooled, concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Millipore), precipitated (18Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar), and run on SDS gels. Bands of interest were excised from SDS gels and sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Dr. William S. Lane). Blood was drawn, and washed platelets were prepared as in a previous study (19Fox J.E.B. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4120-4126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the addition of 50 ng/ml prostaglandin I2 and 0.6 unit/ml apyrase in the collecting solution. The platelet pellet was resuspended in Tyrode's Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmMgCl2, to a concentration of 7 × 108platelets/ml, and the platelet suspension was allowed to rest at 37 °C for 45 min. Platelet aggregation was monitored by light transmittance following the addition of agonists with stirring (1200 r.p.m.) to 500-μl aliquots of platelet suspensions. For time courses of aggregated platelets, platelet suspensions were activated with an agonist and were allowed to aggregate until specific time points. When aggregation was induced by the LIBS antibody D3, 0.3 μg/ml soluble fibrinogen was added 30 s prior to D3. Reactions were then stopped with the addition of 500 μl of 2× lysis buffer B (100 mmTris base, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, 8 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 mg/ml leupeptin), plus 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mmCaCl2. Samples were left on ice 30 min. Time courses of activated platelets were determined under identical conditions except platelets were treated with 2.5 μg/ml eptifibatide prior to stirring to inhibit aggregation. Each sample was then sonicated for 10 s. Lysates were incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with 1 μg of biotinylated rabbit IgG followed by another 45-min incubation with 70 μl of a 50% slurry of avidin-agarose (in PBS, pH 7.4). At the end of the “pre-clear” steps, lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples were split, and 2 μg of either biotinylated anti-Shc or biotinylated rabbit control IgG was added to each 500-μl sample. Incubations with the antibodies continued overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then incubated with 70 μl of 50% avidin-agarose bead slurry for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation reactions were spun 20 s at 14,000 ×g, the supernatant was aspirated off, and the pellet was washed with 250 μl of 0.5 m NaCl in 1× lysis buffer B. Following recentrifugation, the wash steps were repeated twice using 1× lysis buffer B. The remaining pelleted beads were resuspended in 2× reducing sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Samples from immunoprecipitations and from peptide precipitations of purified recombinant Shc were run on gels, which were then transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose supports and blotted with specific antibodies. For the immunoprecipitation experiments, blots of samples were cut in half and probed for phosphorylated tyrosine residues (using PY20 and 4G10) and αIIbβ3 (#4518); blots probed with phosphotyrosine antibodies were then stripped and reprobed with Shc antibodies. These blots of samples from immunoprecipitations using biotinylated antibodies were developed with Protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and detected with ECL Western blotting detection reagents. Thus, IgG heavy chain of the immunoprecipitating, biotinylated anti-rabbit Shc polyclonal and anti-rabbit IgG control antibodies was not detected, and the observed band patterns were not obscured. Blots of IgG control immunoprecipitations showed no co-immunoprecipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (data not shown). The pGEX-3X bacterial expression plasmid and the pGex-3X-p52Shc construct (20Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Ministri K. Hughes P.E. Forsyth J. Turner M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Tybulewicz V.L. Phillips D.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the latter which contained the p52 Shc sequence inserted in-frame with the pGex-3X glutathione S-transferase (GST) sequence at the unique EcoRI site, were used to transform the protease-deficient BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli strain of cells (Novagen). For GST and GST-Shc fusion protein expression, bacterial preparations were induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 2 h. Bacteria were lysed in 2× lysis buffer B (2% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 8 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C to pellet the cell wall, the expressed GST and GST fusion proteins were isolated from bacterial cell lysates by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which were pre-equilibrated in 1× lysis buffer B. GST and GST-Shc fusion proteins were then eluted with reduced glutathione (10 mm). To determine whether Shc can bind to phosphorylated β3, equal amounts of GST and GST-Shc fusion proteins were mixed with one of non-phosphorylated, monophosphorylated (on the N-terminal tyrosine; biotin-DTANNPLpYKEATSTFTNITYRGT-COOH), monophosphorylated (on the C-terminal tyrosine; biotin-DTANNPLYKEATSTFTNITpYRGT-COOH), scrambled diphosphorylated (biotin-TNIEARTpYASKLDPTGTFTpYTNN), or diphosphorylated β3 peptide, 50 μg of which was bound to avidin-agarose and suspended in 1× lysis buffer B. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the avidin-agarose-bound phospho or non-phospho β3 peptides were washed with 1× lysis buffer B. Beads were resuspended in 2× sample buffer, and samples were separated on a 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed for the presence of Shc and GST with corresponding polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). The Shc immunoprecipitation procedure described above was optimized for mouse blood. First, blood was obtained by cardiac puncture (700 μl) and drawn into a mix of 140 μl of 2.5% trisodium citrate/2% dextrose/1.5% citric acid monohydrate, 560 μl of saline, and prostaglandin E1 at 50 ng/ml final concentration. Washed platelets were obtained as described (21Thomas D. Patterson S.D. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28924-28931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Platelets pooled from five to six animals were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer with 1 mm MgCl2 at 6 × 108/ml. Thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was measured in the aggregometer. Platelets were lysed 15 s after thrombin by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 2× lysis buffer B into the aggregometer tube. Samples were then incubated on ice for 20 min prior to sonication (6 × 10 s bursts at amplitude 60). Lysates were precleared with 50 μl of avidin-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C then spun in a microcentrifuge at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were recovered, and for each immunoprecipitate, 200 μl of lysate was incubated with 2 μg of either biotinylated rabbit IgG (control) or biotinylated anti-Shc antibody and 50 μl of avidin-agarose overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed and resuspended in sample buffer, as with human immunoprecipitates, and loaded onto SDS gels for Western blotting analysis. To identify platelet proteins that selectively bind the phosphorylated tail of β3, we designed an affinity procedure that had three columns in series: avidin-agarose, the support matrix; a β3 peptide (β3740–762); and a diphosphorylated β3 peptide ((pY747,pY759) β3740–762). The peptides were synthesized with a biotin moiety at their N terminus, which was used to conjugate them to avidin-agarose. We determined in preliminary experiments that the yield of phospho-β3 binding proteins would be small, and therefore used a high platelet count to retrieve detectable yields of proteins on the columns. Fig. 1 shows a silver-stained gel of proteins eluting from the three columns. A similar cohort of bands was distributed throughout all columns, most prominently a 210-kDa band corresponding to platelet myosin heavy chain, an 85-kDa band corresponding to α-actinin, and a 45-kDa band corresponding to actin. Cytoskeletal proteins are found in abundance in human platelets, and the soluble forms of these proteins apparently were not completely removed by the ultracentrifugation step used in generating the platelet supernatants that were loaded onto the columns. However, one protein, of molecular mass ≅ 60 kDa, specifically eluted with phenyl phosphate off the diphosphorylated β3affinity column and was not found in eluates of either the avidin-agarose precolumn or the non-phosphorylated β3column. Direct protein sequencing revealed that this protein was Shc, because tryptic digests of it contained 22 different peptides, each of which had 100% homology to this adapter protein (Fig.2). Western immunoblotting with Shc antibody (Fig. 3) confirmed that Shc only eluted from the diphosphorylated β3 column: the apparent molecular mass of this protein (57 kDa) was identical to the only Shc-positive band identified by Western blotting found in platelets. This and the spectrum of peptides identified by sequencing indicate that we isolated the p52 isoform of Shc and that this is the only Shc isoform found in platelets.Figure 1Identification of Shc as the major protein specifically eluting from a diphosphorylated β3 peptide column. Platelets were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and the majority of cytoskeletal proteins were removed by ultracentrifugation. The supernatant was run over three columns in series; Pre, avidin-agarose precolumn; β 3, the non-phosphorylated β3 peptide column; diP, the doubly phosphorylated β3 peptide column. Columns were washed separately, and proteins were eluted using 0.8 mphenyl phosphate. Samples from fractions eluted off of all three columns were run on 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and silver-stained. The gel shown here represents fractions 17 through 20 and is representative of three independent experiments.

Fig.4 shows Shc phosphorylation during platelet aggregation induced by thrombin, a potent platelet agonist. Shc tyrosine phosphorylation increased dramatically during thrombin-induced aggregation (11.4 ± 0.8-fold), reaching a maximum 20 s after the addition of thrombin. With continued stirring, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation decreased, to 9.1 ± 0.5-fold at 45 s, to 6.8 ± 0.4-fold at 90 s of aggregation, and to 1.4 ± 0.1-fold at 270 s. A reprobe of the immunoprecipitate blot with Shc polyclonal antibodies showed that each lane contained an equal amount of Shc (middle panel). Thrombin signaling alone, in the absence of aggregation, is sufficient to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of several platelet proteins (22Ferrell J.E. Martin G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3606-3610Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar,23Nakamura S. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7089-7091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the extent of Shc phosphorylation due to thrombin activation as compared with thrombin aggregation, the αΘΘbβ3-specific antagonist eptifibatide was used to prevent aggregation. Although Shc phosphorylation still occurred in the absence of aggregation, the -fold increase was approximately half of that observed when aggregation also occurred, 6.2 ± 0.3 at 20 s, 4.3 ± 0.4 at 45 s, and to control levels at 270 s. Thus, Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, much like that observed with Syk, appears to be induced by two pathways in platelets: one induced by thrombin stimulation, most likely a pathway initiated by protease-activated receptor activation and involving inside-out αIIbβ3 signaling; and the other induced by platelet aggregation, most likely a pathway initiated by αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling. Previous studies have shown that outside-in signaling involves, in part, the tyrosine phosphorylation of β3. To determine whether outside-in signaling allows for the interaction of Shc with β3, we determined whether β3 could be co-immunoprecipitated with Shc upon aggregation. The lower panel in Fig. 4 shows that β3 co-immunoprecipitated with Shc during the initial time points of platelet aggregation, at 20 s and at 45 s. In contrast, no β3 was detected in immunoprecipitates from thrombin-activated platelets (i.e. in the presence of eptifibatide), even though the activation does induce Shc tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, outside-in signaling through αIIbβ3 induced Shc association with the integrin. LIBS antibodies recognize determinants on αIIbβ3, which induce a conformational change in the integrin that permits the binding of fibrinogen and platelet aggregation, without the requirement for platelet stimulation (24Frelinger III, A.L. Du X.P. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have established that β3 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated during LIBS antibody-induced platelet aggregation (10Jenkins A.L. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Silver D. Sellers J.R. Ginsberg M.H. Law D.A. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13878-13885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that LIBS antibody-induced platelet aggregation also induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. A significant increase in Shc tyrosine phosphorylation occurred at the first two time points of platelet aggregation in the presence of LIBS antibody, 1.9 ± 0.1-fold 45 s after the addition of D3, 2.6-fold ± 0.1 90 s after, and 2.6-fold ± 0.2 270 s after.

In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, several cdc(cell division cycle) mutants that block initiation of chromosomal DNA replication have been isolated and characterized (1Hartwell L.H. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 115: 966-974Crossref Google Scholar, 2Hartwell L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), for example, cdc28, cdc4,cdc6, and cdc7. The stepwise assembly of proteins at origins of DNA replication is a crucial part of regulating entry into S phase. Two key factors that mediate such cell cycle regulation are Cdc6 protein level and availability and the presence of an active cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) (see Ref. 3Stillman B. Science. 1996; 274: 1659-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar for review). The origin recognition complex is bound to origins of DNA replication at all stages of the cell cycle in S. cerevisiae (4Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 5Liang C. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 6Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, Cdc6 is not recruited to origins until late in M phase and is required for the association of the Mcm2–7 family proteins at origins to form a prereplicative complex (6Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 7Detweiler C.S. Li J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 753-763PubMed Google Scholar, 8Donovan S.

The Cdc6 protein-dependent stage of the assembly reaction is inhibited by active Clb-Cdks (6Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1516-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Because Cdc6 protein is synthesized only from late M phase until late G1 (11Piatt S. Lengauer C. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3788-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), prereplicative complexes can only be assembled during this period of the cell cycle. S phase cyclin-Cdk (Cdc28p/Clb5p or Cdc28p/Clb6p) activity is required for the chromatin association of Cdc45p just before the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication (12Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The previous results demonstrated that Cdc28 protein-Clb kinase is required throughout S phase to activate origins when they are scheduled to fire (13Donaldson A.D. Raghuraman M.K. Friedman K.L. Cross F.R. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 173-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The Cdc7/Dbf4 complex is a Cdk-like protein kinase (see Refs. 14Johnston L.H. Masai H. Sugino A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 249-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and 15Oshiro G. Owens J.C. Shellman Y. Sclafani R.A. Li J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholarfor review) that is also required for entry into S phase at a very late stage. CDC7 transcript levels are constant throughout the cell cycle, whereas DBF4 transcription is cell cycle regulated and the transcript abundance peaks near the G1 to S phase transition. The DBF4 gene was first identified as a gene that could suppress cdc7 mutants when present in multiple copies (16Kitada K. Johnston L.H. Sugino T. Sugino A. Genetics. 1992; 131: 21-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Dbf4p is now known to be required for Cdc7p-mediated kinase activity. It has been shown that a Cdc7p-associated H1 kinase activity is cell cycle regulated (17Jackson A.L. Pahl P.M.B. Harrison K. Rosamond J. Sclafani R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether this H1 kinase activity reflects the normal activity of the Cdc7p kinase. Recently, homologues of Cdc7p have been identified in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (18Masai H. Miyake T. Arai K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3094-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), mouse (19Kim J.M. Sato N. Yamada M. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22083-22090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 24Takeda T. Ogino K. Matsui E. Cho M.K. Kumagai H. Miyake T. Arai K. Masai H. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5083-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The presence of these homologues in evolutionarily distant species suggests that Cdc7p/Dbf4p plays a conserved role in the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes. Several lines of evidence suggest that Cdc7p/Dbf4p acts directly at origins of DNA replication and that the Mcm proteins may be one of the targets of the kinase. DBF4 was isolated in a one-hybrid screen for autonomously replicating sequence (ARS)1-interacting factors (26Dowell S.J. Romanoski P. Diffley J.F.X. Science. 1994; 265: 1243-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Interestingly, its interaction with origins was found to be independent of its ability to bind to Cdc7p. Two recent reports (27Bousset K. Diffley J.F.X. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar,28Donaldson A.D. Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) suggest that Cdc7p activity is required to activate individual origins rather than for a global activation of S phase, because temperature-sensitive cdc7 mutants demonstrate an inability to activate late rather than early replication origins at a semi-permissive temperature. Potential target(s) of Cdc7p that are required for the initiation of DNA replication were revealed through genetic analysis of a mutant in S. cerevisiae that could bypass the requirement for CDC7 or DBF4 (17Jackson A.L. Pahl P.M.B. Harrison K. Rosamond J. Sclafani R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The mutation was found to reside in MCM5/CDC46 (29Hardy C.F.J., O. Dryga O. Pahl P.M.B. Sclafani R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3151-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), a member of the Mcm family of six sequence-related proteins (30Tye B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2399-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since then, a number of reports have suggested that some Mcm proteins such as Mcm2 and Mcm3 are in vitro substrates of Cdc7p kinases from various sources (21Sato N. Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4340-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23Brown G.W. Kelly T.J. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Another study recently reported that all yeast Mcm proteins, except for Mcm5 expressed and prepared from insect cells, were substrates for the Cdc7/Dbf4p protein kinase complex (32Weinreich M. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5334-5346Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). RAD53 encodes a dual specificity protein kinase that is required for all three DNA damage checkpoints at G1, S phase, and G2 (33Sanchez Y. Desany B.A. Jones W.J. Liu Q. Wang B. Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 271: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). It is thought to be part of the transducer class (34Weinert T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Several lines of circumstantial evidence suggest that in addition to its checkpoint function, Rad53p could be also involved in the regulation of temporal order origin firing during chromosomal DNA replication (35Santocanale C. Diffley J.F.X. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the expression and the purification of recombinant yeast Cdc7p/Dbf4p to near homogeneity and biochemical analysis of the Cdc7p/Dbf4p complex-associated protein kinase activity. We show that both subunits of the recombinant enzyme are auto-phosphorylated and that this reaction requires active Dbf4p and Cdc7p. The recombinant protein efficiently phosphorylates Mcm2 and also phosphorylates with somewhat lower efficiency the remaining Mcm proteins as well as the largest subunit of DNA polymerase α-primase and RPA. However, when Mcm2 protein was pretreated with an alkaline phosphatase, it was not phosphorylated by the Cdc7p/Dbf4p kinase, suggesting that Mcm2 protein must be prephosphorylated by an unknown kinase(s) to be a substrate for Cdc7/Dbf4 protein kinase. Analysis of mutant Cdc7/Dbf4 protein kinases suggests that ARS-binding and Cdc7 protein kinase activation domains of Dbf4p collaborate to form an active Cdc7p/Dbf4p complex that functions in chromosomal DNA replication. Finally, inhibition of the Cdc7p/Dbf4p complex kinase activity by Rad53p-mediated phosphorylation is demonstrated. Based on these results, it is proposed that Rad53p regulates the temporal activation of chromosomal DNA replication origins in yeast by regulating the activity of Cdc7p/Dbf4p protein kinase. The following yeast strains were used in this study: S. cerevisiae 208 (MATa cdc7-1 ura3-52 leu2-3, 112), L128-2D (MATa dbf4-1 ura3 trp1), L202-1A (MATa dbf4-2 ura3 leu2 trp1), KKY743 (MATα dbf4-3 ura3 leu2 trp1), KKY744 (MATα dbf4-4 ura3 leu2 trp1), and KKY745 (MATα dbf4-5 ura3 leu2 trp1) were previously described (16Kitada K.

YKY9 (MATa leu2 trp1-298 ura3-52 prb ΔPEP4::TRP1), and YKY30 (MATαura3 leu2 trp1 bob1 ΔCDC7::LEU2 ΔPEP4::TRP1) were used for expression and purification of GST-Mcm 2–7 proteins. CB001–2HA-Rad53 (MATα leu2 trp1 ura3 prb pep4::URA3 RAD53::[YCpRAD53-HA]) was constructed by transforming S. cerevisiae CB001 (36Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Clark A.B. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A.

Oligonucleotides 5′-GGCCAGATCTCATAATGACAAGCAAAACGA-3′, 5′-GGCCAGATCTTTGCTATTCAGATATTAGG-3′, 5′-GGCCGGATCCAAGAAAATGGTTTCTCCAACGAAA-3′, and 5′-GGCCGGATCC CTATATTTGAAATCTGAGATT-3′ (underlined nucleotides represent either BglII orBamHI sites, and bold nucleotides are the initiation or termination codons) were synthesized on an automated DNA synthesizer (Beckman) and were used for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the DNA fragments containing CDC7 and DBF4 on the plasmid pKK709 and pKK616 DNA (16Kitada K.

Amplified DNA was digested with either BglII (for CDC7) or BamHI enzyme (for DBF4) and inserted into either BglII- or BamHI-digested baculovirus vector pBacPAK9. The resulting constructs, pBac-Cdc7p and pBac-Dbf4p, were co-transfected withBsu36I-linealized wild type virus BacPAK6 viral DNA into Sf9 cells using cationic liposome-mediated transfection according to the Invitrogen protocol, and recombinant virus was plaque purified. The presence of an insert in a putative recombinant virus was verified by polymerase chain reaction using primers complementary to the polyhedron locus. Recombinant virus Bac-Cdc7p 17 and Bac-Dbf4p 32 were amplified in Sf9 cells to a titer of 108plaque-forming units/ml. Recombinant virus containing mutantcdc7-1 or dbf4-1∼5 were constructed as wild type CDC7 and DBF4 genes. Sf9 cells were grown to confluence in T-75 Falcon flasks at 27 °C in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 0.1% pleuronic F-68 and infected with recombinant virus pBac-Cdc7 17 or pBac-Dbf4 32 at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Cells were harvested at 72 h post-infection by centrifugation at 1,200 × g and washed twice with serum-free Grace's medium. Recombinant virus pBac-Cdc7 17 and pBac-Dbf4 32 were used to infect 2 L of Sf9 cells (2 × 106cells/ml) at a multiplicity of infection of 10. After 72 h the cells were harvested, washed with serum-free Grace's medium, resuspended in 60 ml of ice-cold HSL buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 500 mm NaCl) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml bacitracin, 250 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm benzamidine), and subjected to sonication by Ultrosonic Disruptor UD-201 (Tomy, Japan). To the cell extract (52 ml), obtained by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min, 16.3 g of solid (NH4)2SO4 (50% saturation) was gradually added with stirring. After 30 min stirring, the extract was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min.

After centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min, the suspension was loaded onto an S-Sepharose column (80 ml) equilibrated in buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. The column was washed with three bed volumes of the same buffer, and the protein was eluted with a 320-ml linear gradient of 100–600 mm NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing Cdc7p and Dbf4p, as identified by activity assays and Western blot analysis (0.2–0.3 m NaCl), were pooled and loaded onto a Hi Trap Heparin column (5 ml) equilibrated with buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl. After washing with three bed volumes of equilibration buffer, protein was eluted with a 120-ml linear gradient of 0.2–1 m NaCl in buffer A.

To cell extracts, NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.5 m. After stirring at 0 °C for 30 min, cell debris was removed by centrifugation in a Beckman JLA10.5 rotor at 8,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was saved. To the supernatant, 10%(w/v) Polymin P (pH 8) solution was slowly added to 0.5% (final concentration), mixed for 15 min, and centrifuged in a Beckman JLA 10.5 rotor at 8000 rpm for 20 min. 0.313 g of ammonium sulfate was added per ml of supernatant, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. The protein precipitate was collected by centrifugation in a Beckman JLA 10.5 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. The pellet was stored at −80 °C. The precipitate was resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A and dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer A for 2 h and 2 liters of 0.1 m NaCl in buffer A for 2 h. Insoluble material was removed from the dialysate by centrifugation in a Beckman JA20.0 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was applied on an S-Sepharose column (75 ml) equilibrated with 0.1 m NaCl in buffer A, the column was washed with three column volumes of 0.1m NaCl in buffer A, and protein was eluted with one column volume of 0.5 m NaCl in buffer A.

Fraction I was dialyzed twice against 2 liters of 0.05 m NaCl in buffer A for 2 h and centrifuged in a Beckman JA20.0 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to remove any precipitates. The supernatant was applied on a Mono Q column (HR 10/10) equilibrated with 0.05 m NaCl in buffer A.

Fractions containing Rad53 protein were identified by protein kinase activity assays and Western blot analysis, and the active fractions were pooled (Fraction IV). HU-activated Rad53p was also purified as described above from CB001 cells expressing 2HA-tagged Rad53p after treating cells with 0.2m hydroxyurea for 3 h at 30 °C. More detailed characterization of the purified 2HA-tagged Rad53p will be published elsewhere. 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin as standard as described previously (31Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Young M.R. Kihara M. Sugino A. Tye B.K.

Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were electroblotted onto an Immobilon-P (Millipore) membrane that was incubated for 30 min with blocking buffer, Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl) containing 2% nonfat dry milk, and incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal antipeptide antiserum to Dbf4p (provided by J. Diffley) or with rabbit polyclonal antiserum to Cdc7p expressed inEscherichia coli (provided by H. Masai). After washing three times with blocking buffer, the membrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1.5 h at room temperature, washed three times with blocking buffer, and washed twice with Tris-buffered saline. Color was developed as described previously (31Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Young M.R. Kihara M. Sugino A. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Protein kinase activity was assayed with GST-Mcm2p purified from S. cerevisiae as a substrate. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 300 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 10,000 cpm/pmol), 10–30 pmol of GST-Mcm2p, and Cdc7p/Dbf4p protein kinase complex or cell extracts. After 5 min at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of stop solution, heated at 95 °C for 3 min, and subjected to 4–20% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, destained, dried and autoradiographed (31Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Young M.R. Kihara M. Sugino A. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To measure radioactivity incorporated into the protein, the corresponding protein bands were excised from the gel and quantitated in the presence of scintillation fluid using a scintillation spectrometer. The purification of yeast GST-Mcm2-Mcm7 from S. cerevisiae was described previously (31Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Young M.R. Kihara M. Sugino A. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and their purity was more than 95% (data not shown). Calf thymus histone H1 (more than 95% pure) was obtained from Nacalai Tesque, Japan. Other methods and materials used in this study were previously described (31Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Young M.R.

The goal of this study was to characterize the Cdc7p/Dbf4p protein kinase and its role in chromosomal DNA replication initiation. Initially, attempts were made to purify the Cdc7p/Dbf4p complex fromS. cerevisiae cell extracts. However, because of its low abundance and the cell cycle-dependent expression of its activity, it was not possible to purify the complex to homogeneity. 2M. Kihara, W. Nakai, S. Asano, A. Suzuki, K. Kitada, Y. Kawasaki, L. H. Johnston, and A. Sugino, unpublished results. Thus, Cdc7p or Dbf4p were expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus system. Although insect cells expressed each protein, the majority of the protein was insoluble (data not shown). Attempts to reconstitute a soluble Cdc7/Dbf4 complex by mixing two cell extracts containing Cdc7p and Dbf4p did not produce any significant amount of soluble, active Cdc7p/Dbf4p complex. Therefore, Cdc7p and Dbf4p were co-expressed in insect cells by mixed infection using the baculovirus system. When soluble extracts were prepared from these cells and precipitated with rabbit antiserum against Cdc7p, both Cdc7p and Dbf4p were precipitated efficiently (see below). Furthermore, the immunoprecipitates incorporated a significant amount of 32P into a GST-Mcm2p substrate when co-incubated with the substrate and [γ-32P]ATP. The Cdc7p/Dbf4p protein kinase complex was purified to near homogeneity from insect cells expressing both Cdc7p and Dbf4p as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 1 shows the elution profile of the partially purified protein complex when applied to a Hi Trap Heparin column, eluted from the column with a 0.2–1 m NaCl linear gradient, and assayed for protein kinase activity using GST-Mcm2p as a substrate. Two peaks of kinase activity, which were not detected in uninfected insect cells (data not shown), are observed; the first peak coincides with peaks of both Cdc7p and Dbf4p (as detected by immunoblotting), suggesting that this peak represent the Cdc7p/Dbf4p protein kinase complex. On the other hand, the second activity peak did not include a significant amount of Dbf4p polypeptide, although it did include some Cdc7p polypeptide (Fig. 1). One explanation for this result is that the second activity peak might coincide with the elution position of an insect cell Dbf4 homologue. Alternatively, Cdc7p might be activated by unknown factor(s). For the purpose of this study, the fractions in the first peak of kinase activity were pooled and further purified by chromatography using several columns (see “Materials and Methods”). The product of the purification is nearly homogeneous and includes two major polypeptides (85 and 58 kDa, respectively) in nearly equimolar quantities. These polypeptides match the expected sizes of Dbf4p and Cdc7p and react appropriately with Cdc7p and Dbf4p antibodies (Fig.1 D). Therefore, we concluded that these two polypeptides are Dbf4p and Cdc7p, respectively. We designate here the Cdc7p/Dbf4p complex purified from insect cells as Cdc7p/Dbf4p* until it will be found that the Cdc7p/Dbf4p protein kinase complex from insect cells is the same as the complex from yeast cells. The untagged and soluble form of the Cdc7p/Dbf4p* protein kinase (Fig. 1) was used for extensive biochemical characterization. Previous work (31Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Young M.R. Kihara M. Sugino A. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the best substrate for the Cdc7p/Dbf4p* protein kinase is GST-Mcm2p purified from yeast cells, so this protein was used as a substrate in many of the following experiments. As shown in Fig. 2, the Cdc7p/Dbf4p* protein kinase quickly phosphorylated GST-Mcm2p (Fig. 2,closed circles) and autophosphorylated both Dbf4p (Fig. 2,open squares) and Cdc7p (data not shown) in 10 min at 30 °C. These data were used to determine that theV max of the kinase activity is 14.5 mol of phosphate/mol of Cdc7/Dbf4p* complex/min at 30 °C. However, theK m for the substrate could not be determined because only 0.2 mol of phosphate was incorporated per mole of substrate, which is most likely because the substrate is not 100% active. As found for most other protein kinases, the activity requires 5–10 mm Mg2+; 1–5 mm Zn2+or Ca2+ partially substitutes for Mg2+ giving 40 and 55% maximal activity, respectively. As shown in Fig.3 A, an addition of 0.2m NaCl severely inhibited phosphorylation of the GST-Mc"

Uptake of putrescine is dependent on the membrane potential, whereas excretion involves putrescine-ornithine antiporter activity. Amino acids involved in both activities were identified using mutated PotE proteins. It was found that Cys62, Trp201, Trp292, and Tyr425 were strongly involved in both activities, and that Tyr92, Cys210, Cys285, and Cys286 were moderately involved in the activities. Mutations of Tyr78, Trp90, and Trp422 mainly affected uptake activity, and the K m values for putrescine uptake by these PotE mutants increased greatly, indicating that these amino acids are involved in the high affinity uptake of putrescine by PotE. Mutations of Lys301 and Tyr308 mainly affected excretion activity (putrescine-ornithine antiporter activity), and excretion by these mutants was not stimulated by ornithine, indicating that these amino acids are involved in the recognition of ornithine. It was found that the putrescine and ornithine recognition site on PotE is located at the cytoplasmic surface and the vestibule of the pore consisting of 12 transmembrane segments. Based on the results of competition experiments with various putrescine analogues and the disulfide cross-linking of PotE between cytoplasmic loops and the COOH terminus, a model of the putrescine recognition site on PotE consisting of the identified amino acids is presented.

Polyamines play important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3230) Google Scholar, 2Pegg A.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20162-20167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) reported that a cysteine residue is important for the activity of the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter in E. coli, which also has 12 transmembrane segments. Thus, we tried to identify additional residues that are involved in the activities of PotE and focused on Trp, Tyr, and Cys residues. The activities of a number of PotE mutants containing mutations at some basic amino acid residues were also examined to look for the site that recognizes the carboxyl group of ornithine. We found several amino acid residues that are involved in the uptake and/or excretion of putrescine. Disulfide cross-linking experiments were performed to determine the proximity of cytoplasmic loops and the COOH terminus of PotE that contain amino acid residues involved in the uptake and excretion activities. Based on the results of the disulfide cross-linking of PotE and the competition experiments with various putrescine analogues, a model of the putrescine recognition site on PotE consisting of the identified amino acids is presented.

For the construction of genes encoding the COOH-terminal half of PotE, polymerase chain reaction was performed using primers 5′-GGAGTCGACATGAGTCAGGCTAAATCGAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTA-3′ (−40 universal primer; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pMWpotE or pMWpotE E207Q as template. The polymerase chain reaction product of the former was digested with SphI and SalI, and that of the latter was digested with SalI and BamHI. The fragments thus obtained were ligated with pMW119 previously digested with SphI and BamHI. E. coliKK313potF::Km/pMWpotE cells grown in medium A containing 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were suspended in buffer 1 containing 0.4% glucose, 62 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1.7 mm sodium citrate, 7.6 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 0.41 mm MgSO4 to yield a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The cell suspension (0.48 ml) was preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was started with the addition of 0.02 ml of 0.25 mm [14C]putrescine (370 MBq/mmol). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 s to 3 min, the cells were collected on membrane filters (cellulose acetate, 0.45 μm; Advantec Toyo), and the filters were washed three times with a total of 12 ml of buffer 1. The radioactivity on the filters was assayed with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Protein content was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli JM105/pMWpotE cells were cultured in the presence of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared by French press treatment of the cells suspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, 10 mm EDTA containing 2.5 mm ornithine (13Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Suzuki F. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4529-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture for the uptake by inside-out membrane vesicles contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.14 m KCl, 50 μm [14C]putrescine (1.48 GBq/mmol), and 100 μg of inside-out membrane vesicle protein. After incubation at 22 °C for 10 s to 1 min, membrane vesicles were collected on membrane filters (cellulose nitrate, 0.45 μm; Advantec Toyo) and washed, and their radioactivities were measured with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Inside-out membrane vesicles (20 μg protein) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12% acrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon transfer membranes (Millipore). PotE was detected using rabbit antibody for the PotE protein (14Kashiwagi K. Shibuya S. Tomitori H. Kuraishi A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), with ProtoBlot Western blot AP System (Promega), except that 0.2% Triton X-100 was used instead of 0.05% Tween 20 (22). Disulfide cross-linking was performed by the method of Kubo et al. (23Kubo Y. Konishi S. Kawabe T. Nada S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5270-5274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with some modifications. First, Cys62 located in the C2 loop and/or Cys210 located in the C4 loop were replaced by serine and alanine, respectively. PotE (C62S/C210A) thus obtained did not have any cysteine residue in the cytoplasmic loops and the NH2 and COOH termini. Cysteine residue was inserted at the 4th or 5th amino acid residue from the putative transmembrane segment (C5, S302C or A321C; C7, L434C) (cf. Fig. 6). As a result, PotE contained one or two molecules of cysteines in the cytoplasmic loops and the COOH terminus of PotE. The reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 28 mm KCl, 2% glycerol, 0.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μg of inside-out membrane vesicle protein prepared as described above was preincubated with or without 30 mm N-ethylmaleimide at 30 °C for 5 min, and then the reaction mixture was incubated with Cu2+/o-phenanthrolin at the final concentration of 0.2 mm at 25 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA (final concentration, 6 mm). After the samples were mixed with 2-mercaptoethanol-free SDS sample buffer, samples containing 30 μg of protein were applied for 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent Western blotting was performed as described above. Disulfide cross-linking was also performed usingN,N′-o-phenylenedimaleimide (6 Å) andN,N′-p-phenylenedimaleimide (10 Å) instead of Cu2+/o-phenanthrolin according to the method of Wu and Kaback (24Wu J. Kaback H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Figure 6Amino acid residues involved in the activities of PotE.

N-(3-Aminopropyl)-n-propylamine (Fig. 8,2), N-(3-aminopropyl)-n-butylamine (Fig. 8, 3),N-(3-aminopropyl)-n-pentylamine (Fig. 8,4), N-ethylputrescine (Fig. 8, 5), andcis-1,4-cyclohexanediamine (Fig. 8, 9) were synthesized according to the method described previously (25Shirahata A. Morohoshi T. Fukai M. Akatsu S. Samejima K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).trans-Diamino-2-butene (Fig. 8, 6) andcis-1,4-diamino-2-butene (Fig. 8, 7) were synthesized as follows; di-tert-butyl iminodicarboxylate was treated with sodium hydride in dimethylformamide followed by reaction with half-equivalent of trans- orcis-1,4-dibromo-2-butene, resulting inN 1,N 1,N 4,N 4-tetra-tert-butoxycarbonyl-1,4-diamino-2-butene. The tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting groups were removed by treatment with 2 m HCl in diethylether. The resulting hydrochloride form of the compounds were recrystallized with water/ethanol. There are 10 tryptophan residues in PotE. These residues were individually mutated to leucine using site-directed mutagenesis of the potE gene. Putrescine uptake activity was measured using the E. coli mutant KK313potF::Km, which is deficient in polyamine uptake, transformed with pMW encoding wild type or mutantpotE. Putrescine excretion activity (i.e.putrescine-ornithine antiporter activity) was measured by [14C]putrescine uptake using ornithine-loaded inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli JM105 transformed with wild type or mutant potE. PotE activity was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. As shown in Fig.1, both uptake and excretion were greatly decreased with the PotE mutants W201L and W292L, whereas uptake of putrescine decreased more than excretion with W422L. There are 14 tyrosine residues in PotE. These residues were also replaced by leucine. Both uptake and excretion of putrescine decreased greatly with the PotE mutant Y425L and moderately with Y92L, and uptake decreased greater than excretion with Y78L and Y90L. In contrast, putrescine excretion decreased more than uptake with Y308L, suggesting that this residue may be involved in the recognition of ornithine in the case of putrescine-ornithine antiporter activity (Fig. 1). There are 6 cysteine residues in PotE. These residues were replaced by alanine. As shown in Fig. 1, both uptake and excretion decreased greatly with PotE C62A, and both activities decreased moderately with C210A, C285A, and C286A. The most dramatic effects on both uptake and excretion of putrescine were seen with the PotE mutants C62A, W201L, W292L, and Y425A (Fig. 1). To confirm the importance of these amino acid residues, each was replaced by several amino acids, and the activities were measured (Fig.2). Replacement of Trp201 and Trp292 by Phe and Tyr did not restore the activities of PotE, indicating that these tryptophan residues are critical for activity. In contrast, replacement of Tyr425 by Trp restored the activities almost completely, and replacement by Phe partially restored activity. Replacement of Cys62 by Ser restored the activities partially, but that by Thr did not restore the activities significantly. Expression of mutated PotE proteins was examined by Western blot analysis of inside-out membrane vesicles. Comparable amounts of mutated PotE were expressed on the membranes (Fig. 2 B). The results strongly suggest that Cys62, Trp201, Trp292, and Tyr425 are important for both uptake and excretion of putrescine together with Glu77, Glu207, and Glu433 (14Kashiwagi K. Shibuya S. Tomitori H. Kuraishi A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Mutants at PotE Y78L, Y90L, and W422L had a greater effect on putrescine uptake than on excretion (Fig. 1). The K mvalue for putrescine uptake by wild type PotE is 1.8 μm, and that for putrescine excretion is 73 μm. Therefore, the K m values for putrescine andV max values of putrescine uptake of these PotE mutants were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots. As shown in Fig.3, the K m values for putrescine increased greatly with these three PotE mutants, and the change in the V max value was small compared with the change in the K m value. The results indicate that these Trp and Tyr residues are involved in the high affinity uptake of putrescine by PotE. Putrescine excretion (via a putrescine/ornithine antiporter) decreased more than uptake with the PotE mutant Y308L (Fig. 1). If other residues are involved in the recognition of ornithine, we might expect basic amino acids to recognize the carboxyl group of ornithine. Because Tyr308 is located in the hydrophilic loop region on the cytoplasmic side of PotE, arginine and lysine residues, located on the cytoplasmic side and structurally close to Tyr308, were mutated to alanine. As shown in Fig. 4, both uptake and excretion were reduced slightly with the PotE mutants K68A and K82A, whereas putrescine excretion was reduced more than uptake with K301A. The activities did not change significantly with other mutated PotE proteins. To ensure that Lys301 and Tyr308 are involved in the recognition of ornithine, inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared in the presence and absence of ornithine, and putrescine uptake by the inside-out membrane vesicles was compared. Putrescine uptake activity with wild type PotE was stimulated by ornithine existing in the vesicles, whereas the activity with mutated PotE K301A and Y308L was not stimulated by ornithine (Fig.5). The results support the idea that Lys301 and Tyr308 are involved in the recognition of ornithine.Figure 5Putrescine uptake activity of inside-out membrane vesicles prepared in the presence or absence of ornithine. Putrescine excretion activities were measured by the putrescine uptake of the inside-out membrane vesicles prepared in the presence or absence of 2.5 mm ornithine as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each point represents the mean of duplicate measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Amino acid residues involved in both uptake and excretion of putrescine are shown in Fig.6. The important residues are located in the transmembrane helices III, VI, VIII, and XII or in the cytoplasmic region between transmembrane helices II and III (C2), VI and VII (C4), VIII and IX (C5), and in the COOH terminus (C7) of PotE. Amino acid residues in the transmembrane helices are also located in the cytoplasmic side rather than the periplasmic side. It is expected that these amino acid residues are located close to each other in the tertiary structure of PotE so that putrescine (or ornithine) can be recognized. To identify the substrate recognition site on PotE, we first tested whether PotE functions as a monomer or dimer. It has been reported that the functional unit of lactose permease is a monomer by measuring the activity of permease dimer, a fusion protein containing two lactose permease molecules (26Sahin-Tóth M. Lawrence M.C. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). If the protein functions as a dimer, it would be expected that the nonfunctional half inhibits the activity dominant-negatively. Thus, we also constructed dimer PotE, a fusion protein containing two PotE molecules of Wild/Wild, Wild/E207Q, E207Q/Wild, and E207Q/E207Q, and examined the putrescine uptake and excretion activities. As shown in Fig.7 A, the activities of Wild/Wild PotE dimer were about twice of the of monomer, Wild/E207Q dimer, and E207Q/Wild dimer. Essentially no significant activities were observed with E207Q/E207Q dimer. The amount of PotE dimer in cells was nearly equal in Wild/Wild, Wild/E207Q, E207Q/Wild, and E207Q/E207Q dimer (Fig. 7 B). The results indicate that the functional unit of PotE is a monomer. The putrescine recognition site on PotF, a substrate-binding protein of the putrescine uptake system consisting of PotF, G, H, and I (3Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), was identified by the crystal structure of PotF as well as the mutational analysis of PotF (11Vassylyev D.G. Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Morikawa K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17604-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To compare the putrescine recognition site on PotE and PotF, the effect of putrescine analogues on putrescine uptake activity was examined. The putrescine analogues added to the reaction mixture of PotE and PotF, G, H, and I were 200 and 50 μm, respectively, because theK m value for putrescine in PotE and PotF, G, H, and I is 1.8 and 0.5 μm, respectively (14Kashiwagi K. Shibuya S. Tomitori H. Kuraishi A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Kashiwagi K. Hosokawa N. Furuchi T. Kobayashi H. Sasakawa C. Yoshikawa M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20893-20897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The putrescine analogue, trans-1,4-diamino-2-butene, inhibited the putrescine uptake activity by PotE and PotF, G, H, and I (Fig.8, number 6).N-Ethylputrescine and 1,3-diaminopropane inhibited the uptake activity by PotF, G, H, and I but not by PotE (Fig. 8,numbers 1 and 5). Because putrescine binds to the cleft between the NH2- and the COOH-terminal domains of PotF (11Vassylyev D.G. Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Morikawa K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17604-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), one side of the substrate recognition site of PotF is open. Thus, N-ethylputrescine, which has extra ethyl group, could be recognized by PotF. Furthermore, 1,3-diaminopropane was also recognized by PotF. PotE could recognizetrans-1,4-diamino-2-butene only, indicating that putrescine recognition site of PotE is more rigid than that of PotF. The results also suggest that putrescine may be recognized at the vestibule rather than the surface of the pore consisting of 12 transmembrane segments, because N-ethylputrescine could not be recognized by PotE. Proximity of periplasmic loops of transport protein consisting of 12 transmembrane segments has been recently studied by the disulfide cross-linking method using Cu2+/o-phenanthrolin (23Kubo Y. Konishi S. Kawabe T. Nada S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5270-5274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Sun J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11959-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The method was applied to determine the proximity of the cytoplasmic loops and the COOH terminus of PotE, which contain amino acid residues involved in the uptake and excretion activities. Because the mobility of mutated PotE (C62S/C210A) during gel electrophoresis did not change with or without N-ethylmaleimide treatment (Fig.9 A, number 10), it was judged that either a disulfide bond was not formed or a structural change seen by the shift of mobility during gel electrophoresis did not occur in four cysteines (Cys135, Cys165, Cys285, and Cys286) located in the transmembrane segments. Judging from the shift of the mobility of PotE in the absence of N-ethylmaleimide, disulfide cross-linking was only observed between the C2 and C4 loops as indicated by the asterisk (Fig. 9 A). The shift of the mobility was not observed with PotE having cysteine residue in either the C2 or the C4 loop. The results suggest that the relative positions of C2 and C4 are close. Furthermore, when a cysteine residue is present in the COOH terminus (C7) of PotE, a dimer was formed as indicated by the double asterisk (cf. Fig. 7 as for the position of the dimer). When a cysteine residue is present in the C2, C4, or C5 loop, formation of the PotE dimer was not apparent. The results suggest that the COOH terminus is located at the surface of the pore consisting of 12 transmembrane segments. Because the shift of the mobility of PotE having two cysteines in the C2 and C4 loops was small, disulfide cross-linking was performed usingN,N′-o-phenylenedimaleimide (6 Å) andN,N′-p-phenylenedimaleimide (10 Å) instead of Cu2+/o-phenanthrolin (24Wu J. Kaback H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The results obtained above were confirmed withN,N′-o-phenylenedimaleimide andN,N′-p-phenylenedimaleimide (Fig.9 B). From the data of Fig. 9 (A and B) and the putrescine recognition model of PotF (11Vassylyev D.G. Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Morikawa K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17604-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a model of the putrescine recognition site on PotE is proposed in Fig. 9 C. One amino group of putrescine is recognized by Glu77 and Glu207, and the other amino group is recognized by Glu433. The position of Glu433 is closer to cytoplasm than Glu77 and Glu207. Two Trp residues (201 and 292) and Tyr425 are important for the recognition of butane moiety of putrescine. Tyr78, Tyr90, and Trp422 are important for the recognition of putrescine from periplasmic side. Cys62 may stabilize the structure of putrescine recognition site through disulfide bond formation with Cys210. Although Cys285 and Cys286 were not shown in the model, these two cysteine residues may also be involved in the maintenance of active structure of PotE through disulfide bond formation. We could not identify the relative position of Lys301 and Tyr308, which recognize the carboxyl group of ornithine. From the present and previous studies (14Kashiwagi K. Shibuya S. Tomitori H. Kuraishi A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we have identified acidic, basic, and aromatic amino acids and cysteine residues that are involved in both uptake and excretion by PotE. These residues are located in the loop and transport passage region on the cytoplasmic side of PotE. It has also been shown that the main functional amino acids of the lactose/H+ synporter (29Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2071-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Poolman B. Modderman R. Reizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9150-9157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and metal tetracycline/H+ antiporter (31Yamaguchi A. Nakatani M. Sawai T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8344-8348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) are located on the cytoplasmic side of the protein. If functional amino acids exist on the cytoplasmic side, they may be able to respond quickly to any metabolic change in the substrate concentration in the cytoplasm. We have previously determined the putrescine and spermidine binding sites on PotD and PotF (8Sugiyama D. Vassylyev D.G. Matsushima M. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Morikawa K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17604-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). According to the model of the lactose/H+ synporter (32Lee J.-I. Hwang P.P. Hansen C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20758-20764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Frillingos S. Sahin-Tóth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), six transmembrane segments among the 12 segments may form the transport passage for the substrate. Considering this model, the amino acid residues that are involved in putrescine recognition on PotE are arranged in a manner similar to the residues necessary for substrate recognition in PotD and PotF (Fig.9 C). One amino group of putrescine is recognized by Glu77 and Glu207, and the other amino group is recognized by Glu433. The butane moiety of putrescine is stacked by Trp201, Trp292, and Tyr425. The results suggest that putrescine is strongly recognized by PotE through the interaction of the N2 amino-terminal half of putrescine (Fig. 9 C). Most important amino acid residues are Glu207 (14Kashiwagi K. Shibuya S. Tomitori H. Kuraishi A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and Trp201 and Trp292 (Fig. 1). When putrescine is recognized from the periplasmic side, the affinity of PotE for putrescine increases through its interaction with Tyr78, Tyr90, and Trp422 in addition to the above mentioned amino acid residues. When ornithine is recognized from the periplasmic side, as is the case when PotE functions as a putrescine-ornithine antiporter, the tertiary structure of PotE may be different from that which recognizes putrescine from the periplasmic side. Unfortunately, we could not identify the relative positions of Lys301 and Tyr308, which recognize the carboxyl group of ornithine. Even when N,N′-o-phenylenedimaleimide (rigid 6 Å),N,N′-p-phenylenedimaleimide (rigid 10 Å), or 1,6-bismaleimidohexane (flexible 16 Å) (data not shown) was used as a cross-linker instead of Cu2+/o-phenanthrolin (24Wu J. Kaback H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we could not determine the relative positions of Lys301 and Tyr308. In TPO1, which is a polyamine transporter ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae (34Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), there are three glutamate residues in a similar position to the three glutamate residues in PotE. All three glutamate residues were involved in the transport activity. 1H. Tomitori, K. Kashiwagi, T. Asakawa, Y. Kakinuma, A. J. Michael, and K. Igarashi, unpublished results. Thus, the tertiary structures of proteins necessary for polyamine recognition may have recognition sites with common motifs in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Our results also suggest that putrescine recognition site is rigid and that both C2 and C4 loops go into the transport passage region of PotE, because N-ethylputrescine inhibited putrescine uptake by PotF, G, H, and I but not by PotE (Fig. 8) and PotE dimer was not formed when cysteine residue existed in the C2 and/or C4 loops (Fig.9 A). It is reasonable to think thatN-ethylputrescine has extra ethyl group so that the compound does not fit the putrescine recognition site located in the vestibule of the pore consisting of 12 transmembrane segments. PotE dimer was formed when cysteine residue exists in the COOH terminus (C7), indicating that the COOH terminus is located at the surface of the channel pore of PotE. Inability to form PotE dimer through cysteine existing in C2 and/or C4 loops suggests that C2 and C4 are not located at the surface of the channel pore of PotE. It is also of interest to know how PotE, which controls uptake and excretion of putrescine, is regulated. There are two ATP-dependent putrescine uptake systems: the spermidine-preferential and putrescine-specific uptake systems (3Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 4Furuchi T. Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 146-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression of the speF-potE operon including the genes for inducible ornithine decarboxylase andpotE is weak at neutral pH (Figs. 1 and 4 and Ref. 35Kashiwagi K. Watanabe R. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, the expression of the operon is probably induced when putrescine is accumulated in cells, and the main function of PotE in E. coli may be the excretion of putrescine. Induction may also occur when the two ATP-dependent uptake systems are absent or nonfunctional. In Rickettsia prowazekii, which has only one fourth the chromosome size of E. coli, only a PotE-like protein exists, not the ATP-dependent polyamine uptake systems (36Andersson S.G. Zomorodipour A.

Although CsA treatment did not affect theK m (20–24 μm) for creatine, it significantly decreased the V max of creatine uptake in both oocytes and muscle cells. CsA treatment reduced the cell surface expression level of the creatine transporter in the muscle cells by ∼60% without significantly altering its total expression level, and the reduction in the cell surface expression paralleled the decrease in creatine uptake. Taken together, our results suggest that CsA inhibited creatine uptake by altering the surface abundance of the creatine transporter. We propose that CsA impairs the targeting of the creatine transporter by inhibiting the function of an associated cyclophilin, resulting in an apparent loss in surface expression of the creatine transporter. Our results also suggest that prolonged exposure to CsA may result in chronically creatine-depleted muscle, which may be a cause for the development of CsA-associated clinical myopathies in organ transplant patients. The immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) inhibited the hCRT-1 cDNA-induced creatine uptake inXenopus oocytes and the endogenous creatine uptake in cultured C2C12 muscle cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 41: 259-371Google Scholar). A large body of evidence suggests that prolonged administration of cyclosporin induces a number of toxic side effects (2Bennett W.M. Burdmann E.

The CsA-induced clinical myopathies were, however, reversed after cessation of cyclosporin and the muscle weakness returned with exacerbation upon reinstitution of cyclosporin therapy (5Arellano F. Krupp P. Lancet. 1991; 337: 915Abstract PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Fernandez-Sola J. Campsitol J. Casademont J. Grau J.M. Urbano-Marquez A. Lancet. 1990; 335: 362-363Abstract PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In vitro, CsA inhibited biochemical differentiation of cultured human myoblasts in a dose-dependent manner without significantly altering their proliferation (10Abbott K.L. Friday B.B. Thaloor D. Murphy T.J. Palvath G.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2905-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Moreover, the muscles of CsA-treated mice were found to be deficient in regenerated muscle fibers (10Abbott K.L. Friday B.B. Thaloor D. Murphy T.J. Palvath G.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2905-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that CsA have profound biochemical and morphological effects on the skeletal muscle. Currently, the cellular mechanism(s) involved in the development of the CsA-induced toxicity, including the possibility of altered energy state of the muscle, is not fully understood. Muscles store millimolar concentration of a high-energy phosphate intermediate, phosphocreatine. During high muscle activity, the enzyme creatine kinase replenishes the consumed ATP quickly by catalytic transfer of the phosphocreatine phosphate group to the ADP (11Walker J.B. Adv. Enzymol. 1979; 50: 177-242PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bessman S.P. Geiger P.J. Science. 1981; 211: 448-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Although phosphocreatine is synthesized in the muscle from creatine, the de novo synthesis of creatine occurs mainly in the human liver, kidney, and pancreas (11Walker J.B. Adv. Enzymol. 1979; 50: 177-242PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to meet their energy demands and to maintain equilibrium between the intracellular concentration of creatine and phosphocreatine, muscles possess a mechanism to actively accumulate creatine from the circulating plasma (see Ref. 13Wyss M. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 133/134: 51-66Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar for a review). Normally, muscles maintain a steep creatine concentration gradient, which is ∼500–1000-fold higher inside the muscle than the plasma creatine concentration (14Beis I. Newsholme E.A. Biochem. J. 1975; 152: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), primarily with the help of a high affinity creatine transporter (13Wyss M. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 133/134: 51-66Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 15Daly M.M. Seifter S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 203: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This creatine concentration gradient (higher inside) is tightly regulated to maintain normal muscle function (12Bessman S.P. Geiger P.J. Science. 1981; 211: 448-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 13Wyss M. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 133/134: 51-66Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Conceivably, chronic dysfunction of the creatine transporter resulting in little or no creatine transport could adversely affect the energy metabolism in the muscle as a result of creatine depletion, which in turn might lead to muscle myopathy. Commensurate with the above idea, a number of studies documented both ultrastructural and functional abnormalities in the muscles of chronically creatine-depleted animals (16Fitch C.D. Jellinek M. Mueller E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1060-1063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mekhfi H. Heorter J. Lauer C. Wisnewsky C. Schwartz K. Ventura-Clapier R. Am. J.

The CRT-1 mRNA is most abundantly expressed in the skeletal muscle among all tissues examined (19Guimbal C. Kilimann M.W. J. Biol.

Analysis of the encoded protein sequence predicts that the creatine transporter contains 12 transmembrane helical domains interconnected by extracellular and intracellular loops (19Guimbal C.

Receptors and Channels. 1994; 2: 165-174PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the cloned CRT-1 cDNAs in heterologous expression systems induced a Na+ and Cl−-dependent creatine uptake that was both biochemically and pharmacologically similar to those obtained using cultured cells (for examples, see Refs.18Dai W. Vinnakota S. Qian X. Kunze D. Sarkar H.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19Guimbal C. Kilimann M.W. J. Biol.

Receptors and Channels. 1994; 2: 165-174PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies, we investigate the effects of CsA on creatine uptake in Xenopus oocytes and cultured muscle cells expressing recombinant and endogenous creatine transporter, respectively. We show that CsA selectively inhibited the activities of both the recombinant and endogenous creatine transporters. Our results further suggest that the inhibition in the creatine uptake is due to an alteration of the relative surface abundance of the creatine transporter. Cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK 506 were generous gifts from Dr. J. Clifford Waldrep and Dr. Albert Chang (Baylor College of Medicine), respectively. [4-14C]Creatine (50 mCi/mmol) and l-[3H(G)]glutamic acid (30 Ci/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO), and 1,2-[3H]taurine was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Arlington Heights, IL). All the other reagents were either ACS grade pure or ultrapure, and were purchased from various commercial sources. C2C12 mouse myoblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine fetal serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For uptake studies, cells were seeded in 6-well culture dishes at a density of ∼105cells/well and were incubated for 2–3 days at 37 °C. Differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes was induced by replacing the growth medium of nearly confluent myoblasts with the differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% heat-inactivated horse serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) followed by an additional period of incubation at 37 °C. Drugs were added directly to the differentiation medium 24 h after the cells were exposed to the differentiation medium, following which cells (nascent myotubes) were incubated at 37 °C for at least 24 h before they were used for uptake studies. The construction of the recombinant plasmid pCrT.3 containing human CRT-1 (hCRT-1) cDNA was described previously (18Dai W. Vinnakota S. Qian X. Kunze D. Sarkar H.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Synthetic RNA (cRNA) was prepared from the pCrT3 plasmid using SP6 RNA polymerase (Epicenter Technologies, WI), and was used to microinject (5 ng/oocyte) defolliculated and healthy Xenopus oocytes (24Ruiz M. Egal H. Sarthy V. Qian X. Sarkar H.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 4039-4048PubMed Google Scholar). The microinjected oocytes were subsequently used for the functional studies as described (18Dai W. Vinnakota S. Qian X. Kunze D. Sarkar H.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Vinnakota S. Qian X. Egal H. Sarthy V. Sarkar H.K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2238-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, uptake assays were carried out at least ∼72 h post-injection. Unless stated otherwise, the creatine uptake studies in oocytes were performed essentially as described earlier (18Dai W. Vinnakota S. Qian X. Kunze D. Sarkar H.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using 30 μm final concentration of [14C]creatine (stock solution: 10 mm; specific activity, 10 mCi/mmol) as a substrate. The creatine uptake in cultured C2C12 cells were measured as follows. Cells were first washed with the choline chloride buffer (ChCl-1 buffer: 135 mm choline chloride, 1 mm calcium chloride, 2 mm potassium chloride, 5 mmmagnesium chloride, 5 mm HEPES-Tris (pH 7.5)). The uptake was initiated by replacing the ChCl-1 buffer with the NaCl-1 buffer (same composition as the ChCl-1 buffer except the choline chloride was replaced with an equimolar amount of NaCl) containing 10 μm [14C]creatine. After incubation for a given period of time, the uptake process was terminated by aspirating off the buffer from each well, followed by three quick washes with ice-cold ChCl-1 buffer. Cells were subsequently solubilized in 1 ml of 1% SDS and the amount of radioactivity in the extract was measured using a Beckman LS 3800 scintillation counter. Protein concentration in a portion of the extract was measured using the Pierce Protein Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). To determine the effect of CsA and FK506 on creatine uptake, C2C12 cells or microinjected oocytes were incubated in the presence of a given concentration of the drug for various time periods. The drug was added directly to the cell culture medium, or to the oocyte bathing medium (Barth's solution: 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.82 mmMgSO4, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 7.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) supplemented with 1 mmsodium pyruvate and 0.01% penicillin/streptomycin). Control cells or oocytes were incubated in parallel with an equivalent amount of the vehicle solvent (ethanol). Pretreated cells and oocytes were subsequently used for uptake assays. K m andV max values for creatine uptake were determined as described previously (18Dai W. Vinnakota S. Qian X. Kunze D. Sarkar H.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) by measuring creatine uptake at various external concentrations of [14C]creatine. A polyclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide (LEYRAQDADVRG), corresponding to an internal portion of the creatine transporter C-terminal tail, was raised in rabbits using the commercial services offered by Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL). Immunoserum from one of the rabbits showed high antibody titer against the synthetic peptide in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. This immunoserum containing anti-C creatine transporter (anti-CrT-C) antibodies was used for immunoblot assay (26Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4354-4355Crossref Scopus (44924) Google Scholar) without further purification. Cell surface expression of the creatine transporter in control and CsA-treated C2C12 cells was determined using the membrane impermeable biotinylation reagent NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) as described (27Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M.Y. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, control and CsA-treated myotubes (∼3 × 105 cells; passages 15–18) were grown as described above, following which cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1.0 mmMgCl2 (phosphate-buffered saline/CM). Biotinylation was carried out using 1.0 mg/ml NHS-SS-biotin in biotinylation buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.0) for 20–25 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. After labeling, cells were washed twice with ice-cold 100 mm glycine in phosphate-buffered saline/CM to quench the residual NHS-SS-biotin. Subsequently, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) by gently shaking on ice for approximately 1 h. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and a portion of the extract (300 μl of extract containing 390 μg of protein) was incubated overnight with 50 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C with gentle agitation. After incubation, beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, twice with high salt wash buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and finally once with no-salt wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The captured biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads with 40 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer and a portion of it (20 μl) was analyzed by immunoblot assay. Total cell extracts and captured biotinylated proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently electrotransferred onto a Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The membrane was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and 2% non-fat dry milk in TBST buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with 1:2000 dilution of the anti-CrT-C antibody for 1–3 h at room temperature. After washing with TBST buffer, the blot was incubated with a 1:15,000 dilution of the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce) for 1–2 h at room temperature. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL-Plus chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subsequently quantified by densitometric scanning of autoradiograms using the AlphaImager 2000 (Alpha Innotech Co., San Leandro, CA). To determine the effect of cyclosporin on creatine uptake CsA (1–30 μM final concentration) or ethanol (vehicle solvent, control) was added to the oocyte bathing medium 24 h after the oocytes were injected with the hCRT-1 cRNA. The oocytes were incubated in the absence and presence of CsA for an additional period of 72 h prior to using them for uptake assays. As shown in Fig.1 A, the creatine uptake in oocytes treated with 1 or 5 μm CsA for 72 h remained unchanged from that of the control uptake level. At higher concentrations, however, CsA inhibited the creatine uptake (Fig.1 A). Thus, in three independent experiments, treatment with 30 μm CsA for 72 h inhibited the creatine uptake in oocytes by ∼38.6 ± 4.5% (mean ± S.E.; results not shown). Fig. 1 B shows that the uptake level in oocytes pretreated with 30 μm CsA for 24 h remained unchanged from that of the control (ethanol, 24 h) uptake. However, the uptake was inhibited by ∼36% in oocytes treated with 30 μm CsA for 48 and 72 h, but not in vehicle solvent-treated (control) oocytes. Addition of 30 μm CsA directly to the uptake buffer of the untreated oocytes also had no effect on the induced creatine uptake (results not shown). To test the specificity of CsA, we examined the effects of cyclosporin C (CsC), a cyclosporin A analog, and FK506, a structurally unrelated immunosuppressive drug (29Ochiai T. Nakajima K. Nagat M. Transplant Proc. 1987; 19: 1284-1286PubMed Google Scholar), on creatine uptake. As shown in Fig.2, neither CsC nor FK506 inhibited the creatine uptake. We used only 3 μm concentration of FK506 because at this concentration FK506 is known to inhibit the PPIase activity of FKBP, and at higher concentration FK506 is toxic for the oocytes (30Helekar S.A. Char D. Neff S. Patrick J.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 179-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In our previous experiments, CsA was added to the oocyte bathing medium 24 h post-injection, and the inhibitory effect of CsA was not apparent for at least another 24 h. To gain further insight into the mechanism of CsA-mediated inhibition of creatine uptake, we examined the relative expression level of the creatine transporter in untreated control oocytes by measuring the appearance of the creatine uptake as a function of time. The creatine uptake levels at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after microinjection were 47.7 ± 10.2 (mean ± S.E.; n = 7 oocytes), 148.1 ± 14.4, 195.8 ± 21.8, and 302.7 ± 38.3 pmol/60 min/oocyte, respectively (results not shown). Since the creatine uptake continued to increase during the time course of the experiment, it is reasonable to assume that the transporters were functionally assembled and targeted to the oocyte cell surface beyond 48 h. Thus, these results raise the possibility that, at least in oocytes, CsA might affect the targeting of the creatine transporter to the cell surface. To rule out the possibility that the effect of CsA on creatine uptake was cell specific, we examined the effect of CsA on the endogenous creatine uptake in cultured C2C12 muscle cells. Creatine uptake in C2C12 cells almost doubled after the myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes by serum deprivation (results not shown). The increased creatine uptake in myotubes is probably due to an increase in the creatine transporter expression as a result of muscle cell differentiation. We did not observe any significant morphological difference between CsA-treated and control C2C12 myoblast (results not shown), which is in agreement with the previous report that CsA minimally affected C2C12 myoblast proliferation (10Abbott K.L. Friday B.B. Thaloor D. Murphy T.J. Palvath G.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2905-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Visual inspection of C2C12 cells treated with CsA for 24 h appeared slightly larger in size than the control myotubes, an effect that was more apparent at higher CsA concentration (results not shown). Moreover, less number of multinucleated differentiated myotubes were found when the differentiated cells were treated with 30 μm CsA in differentiation medium (results not shown), which is also consistent with the earlier observation by Abbott et al. (10Abbott K.L. Friday B.B. Thaloor D. Murphy T.J. Palvath G.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2905-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). At 10 μm concentration of CsA, however, visually the number and the appearance of C2C12 myotubes were virtually similar to those in the control plate (results not shown). Therefore, we used differentiating C2C12 cells and 10 μm CsA for most of our studies. The Na+-dependent creatine uptake in C2C12 nascent myotubes decreased when cells were treated with 10 μm CsA 48 h (Fig.3, compare 1 versus 2). In parallel experiments, CsA treatment also inhibited the Na+-dependent taurine uptake significantly (Fig. 3, compare 3 versus 4), while the Na+-dependent glutamate uptake remained mostly unaffected (Fig. 3, compare 5 versus 6) in C2C12 myoblasts. Since the transport of creatine, glutamate, and taurine via their respective Na+-dependent transporters are driven by the sodium electrochemical gradient of the cell, our observation rules out the possibility that the effect of CsA on creatine uptake was due to a general decrease in the driving force.Figure 1CsA inhibits creatine uptake in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A, dose dependence: a day after the oocytes were injected with hCRT-1 cRNA (∼5 ng/oocyte), CsA or ethanol was added directly to the medium bathing the oocytes, and the oocytes were incubated in the absence or presence of CsA for an additional ∼72 h at 18 °C. Subsequently, the oocytes were used for a 30-min uptake assay at room temperature as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as mean creatine uptake ± S.E. (n = 6–8 oocytes). Uninjected oocytes were used as negative control. *,p < .0001. B, time dependence: microinjected oocytes were treated with CsA (30 μm) or vehicle solvent (ethanol; control) for 24, 48, and 72 h. In all cases, CsA was added a 24 h after the oocytes were injected. The control and CsA-treated oocytes were subsequently used for a 30-min creatine uptake assay. Results are expressed as mean uptake ± S.E. (n = 6 oocytes). *, p < .005.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Effect of CsA treatment on creatine, glutamate, and taurine uptake in C2C12 nascent myotubes. Twenty-four hours after the C2C12 myoblasts were subjected to differentiation by serum deprivation, 10 μm CsA was added directly to the differentiation medium and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h at 37 °C. Ethanol-treated control (1, 3, and 5) and CsA-treated (2, 4, and6) cells were subsequently used for a 60-min uptake assay in NaCl-1 buffer containing 10 μm[14C]creatine (1 and 2), 5 μm [3H]taurine (3 and4), or 5 μm [3H]glutamate (5 and 6) as a substrate. Results (mean of duplicate measurement ± deviation) are expressed as % of control uptake.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CsA inhibited the endogenous creatine uptake in C2C12 cells both in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig.4). As shown in Fig. 4 A, treatment with various concentrations of CsA for 24 h resulted in decreased creatine uptake, and the decrease in uptake was higher as the CsA concentration was increased. The inhibitory effect of CsA also increased with time of treatment. At 1 μm CsA, the inhibition in uptake was ∼10% (n = 3;p < 0.04) at 24 h (Fig. 4A), which increased to ∼28% (n = 3; p < 0.05) at 96 h (results not shown). At 10 μm CsA, the uptake was inhibited by ∼40 and ∼65% at 24 and 48 h, respectively (Fig.4 B). Compared with the results obtained with oocytes expressing the hCRT-1 cRNA, a lower dose and a shorter incubation time were required for CsA to inhibit the endogenous creatine uptake in the C2C12 muscle cells. This discrepancy may be due to a difference in the amount and/or rate of diffusion of CsA into these two different cell types. FK506, another potent immunosuppressive drug that acts via its own receptor FKBP, did not mimic the effect of CsA even at a concentration of 3 μm, which is significantly higher than its immunosuppressive dose. These results, in general, are similar to the results obtained using the oocytes expressing the hCRT-1 cDNA. We further examined whether CsA inhibited the creatine uptake by altering the K m and/or theV max of creatine transport. To this end, we measured the rate of uptake as a function of various extracellular concentrations of [14C]creatine. In both CsA-treated or ethanol-treated (control) oocytes expressing the hCRT-1 cDNA, the rate of uptake increased hyperbolically as the external creatine concentration was increased (Fig. 5). Similar results were also obtained using the control and the CsA-treated C2C12 cells (results not shown). These results were further analyzed using the Michaelis-Menten equation and the results are summarized in TableI. As shown, CsA treatment did not affect the K m for creatine in both oocytes and C2C12 cells. Moreover, the observedK m (20–24 μm) value is very similar to the K m value we reported earlier for the recombinant hCRT-1 (18Dai W. Vinnakota S. Qian X. Kunze D. Sarkar H.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, CsA treatment resulted in reducing the V max for creatine uptake in CsA-treated C2C12 cells by ∼72% and in CsA-treated oocytes by ∼36%. Currently, we do not know why CsA reducedV max to different extents in cells and oocytes. One explanation is that the observed discrepancy might be simply due a difference in the cell type (mammalian versus amphibian). Nevertheless, these results suggest that theV max effect is probably due to a reduction of the amount of transporters in the cell surface (i.e. steady state levels at the plasma membrane).Table IEffect of CsA on Km and Vmax of creatine uptakeC2C12 cellsOocyteControlCsA-treatedControlCsA-treatedK m(μm)24.820.722.322.6% Decrease inV max7236Creatine concentration-dependent creatine uptake was measured in CsA-treated (10 μm, 2"

The exodomain has seven to nine Leu-rich repeats, which are generally thought to form a 1/3 donut-like structure and interact with human choriogonadotropin (hCG). The resulting hCG-exodomain complex adjusts the structure and its association with the endodomain, which results in signal generation in the endodomain. It is unclear whether the rigid 1/3 donut structure could provide the agility and versatility of this dynamic action. In addition, there is no clue as to where the endodomain contact point (the signal modulator) in the exodomain is. To address these issues, the exodomain was examined by Ala scan and multiple substitutions, while receptor peptides were used for photoaffinity labeling and affinity cross-linking. Our results show that the C-flanking sequence (hinge region), Thr250–Gln268, of the Leu-rich repeats (LRRs) specifically interacts with hCG, preferentially hCGα. This interaction is inhibited by exoloop 2 of the endodomain but not by exoloops 1 and 3, suggesting an intimate relationship between Thr250–Gln268, exoloop 2, and hCG. Taken together, our observations in this article suggest a new paradigm that the LRRs contact the front of hCG, while both flanking regions of the LRRs interact with the sides of hCG. This would trap hCG in the 1/3 donut structure of the LRRs and enhance the binding affinity. In addition, mutations of conserved Ser255 in the sequence can constitutively activate the receptor. This provides a clue for the signal modulator in the exodomain. In contrast, a phenyl or phenolic group is necessary at conserved Tyr253 for targeting the receptor to the surface.

There is ample evidence that the exodomain of the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LH/CG-R)1 alone is capable of binding hCG with high affinity. The truncated exodomain lacking the endodomain binds hCG with a high affinity similar to or slightly better than the wild type affinity (1Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Dufau M.L. J. Biol.

LHR peptides corresponding to three regions in the exodomain are capable of inhibiting hCG binding to the receptor (20Roche P.C. Ryan R.J. McCormick D.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A major feature in the structure of the LHR exodomain is the Leu-rich repeat (LRR) motif (21McFarland K. Sprengel R.

Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). LRRs are found in a large number of proteins (23Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). The existing crystal structures of a few LRR proteins show up to 15 LRRs, which form a rigid 2/3 donut structure (24Kobe B. Deisenhofer J.

Based on these LRR crystal structures, the glycoprotein hormone receptors have been modeled (26Jiang X. Dreno M. Buckler D. Cheng S. Ythier A. Wu H. Hendrickson W. Tayar N.

Recently, it has been shown that the putative LRRs in the gonadotropin receptors are indeed active and that part of them interact with hCG (33Song Y.S. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N.W. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 3426-3435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 34Song Y.S. Ji I. Beauchamp J. Isaacs N.W. Ji T.H. J. Biol.

However, it is unclear whether the rigid 1/3 donut structure of the LRRs alone interacts with hCG, adjusts its conformation, contacts with the endodomain, and activates the endodomain or if other regions of the exodomain are involved in the process. This agility and versatility may come from regions other than the LRRs. For example, we have shown that the N-terminal flanking region of the LRRs makes strong contact with both subunits of hCG (36Hong S. Phang T. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13835-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 37Phang T. Kundu G. Hong S. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol.

However, it is unknown whether the N-terminal flanking region of the LRRs is the only exodomain region outside of the LRRs to interact with hCG. In addition to the insufficient knowledge on the exodomain/hCG interaction, little is known about the contact sites between the exodomain and endodomain. There is evidence that exoloops 2 and 3 of the endodomain are involved in the interaction with unliganded exodomain and constrain the hormone binding at the exodomain (8Ryu K. Lee H. Kim S.

However, there is no clue to where the endodomain contact point is in the exodomain. In this article, the first evidence is presented that the hinge region interacts with hCG and that the hCG-exodomain complex makes contacts with exoloop 2 of the endodomain. The N-hydroxysuccinimide of 4-azidobenzoic acid (NHS-AB) was synthesized as described previously (39Ji I. Ji T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5465-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide esters of ethylene glycolbis(sulfosuccinimidylsuccinate) (SES) were purchased from Pierce. The hCG CR 127 and hCG subunits were supplied by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program. Denatured hCG was prepared by boiling hCG in 8m urea for 30 min. Receptor peptides were synthesized andN-acetylated and C-amidated by Biosynthesis (Lewisville, TX). They were purified on a Vydac C18 high performance liquid chromatography column using a solvent gradient from 100% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 20% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and 80% 1-propanol. Mutant LHR cDNAs were prepared in a pSELECT vector using the Altered Sites Mutagenesis System (Promega), sequenced, subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described previously (40Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20851-20854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and sequenced again to verify mutation sequences. This procedure does not involve polymerase chain reaction, and therefore, there are no polymerase chain reaction-associated unintended mutations. To produce truncated receptors, a codon was substituted with a stop codon. Mutant and truncated LHR constructs were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells by the calcium phosphate method. Stable cell lines were established in minimum essential medium containing 10% horse serum and 500 μg/ml of G-418. They were used for hormone binding and cAMP production. All assays were carried out in duplicate and repeated four to six times. Means and standard variations were calculated. Stable cells were assayed for 125I-hCG binding in the presence of a constant amount of 125I-hCG (39Ji I. Ji T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5465-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled hCG. The K dvalues were determined by Scatchard plots. For intracellular cAMP assay, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in the medium containing isobutylmethylxanthine (0.1 μg/ml) for 15 min. Increasing concentrations of hCG were then added, and the incubation was continued for 45 min at 37 °C. After removing the medium, the cells were rinsed once with fresh medium without isobutylmethylxanthine, lysed in 70% ethanol, freeze-thawed in liquid nitrogen, and scraped. After pelleting cell debris at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in 10 μl of the cAMP assay buffer, which was provided by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. cAMP concentrations were determined with an125I-cAMP assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instruction and validated for use in our laboratory. All assays for cAMP and binding to intact cells and solubilized receptors were repeated four to six times in duplicate to calculate means ± S.D. Transfected cells were washed twice with ice-cold 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (buffer A). Cells were scraped on ice and collected in buffer A containing protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 10 mm EDTA) and pelleted by centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 10 min. Cells from a 10 cm plate were resuspended in 0.6 ml of buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, and the above protease inhibitors (buffer B), incubated on ice for 15 min, and diluted with 5.4 ml of buffer A containing 20% glycerol plus the protease inhibitors (buffer C). The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant (500 μl) was mixed with 150,000 cpm of125I-hCG and 6.5 μl of 0.9% NaCl and 10 mmNa2HPO4 at pH 7.4 containing increasing concentrations of unlabeled hCG. after incubation at 4 °C for 12 h, the solution was thoroughly mixed with 250 μl of buffer A containing bovine γ-globulin (5 μg/ml) and 750 μl of buffer A containing 20% polyethylene glycol 8000. After incubation at 4 °C for 10 min, samples were pelleted at 1300 × g for 30 min and supernatants removed. Pellets were resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer A containing 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, centrifuged, and counted for radioactivity. NHS-AB was freshly dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to a concentration of 50 mm in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, to a concentration of 20 mm. This reagent solution was immediately used to derivatize receptor peptides. In the dark, 10 μl of NHS-AB was added to 30 μg of LHR246–269 in 40 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The mixture was incubated for 30 min for NHS-AB or 60 min for NHS-AB at 25 °C. The following were added to the derivatization mixture: 1 mCi of Na125I in 10 μl of 0.1 m NaOH and 7 μl of chloramine T (1 mg/ml) in 10 mm Na2HPO4 and 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS). After 20 s, 7 μl of sodium metabisulfite (2.5 mg/ml) in PBS was introduced to terminate radioiodination. Derivatized and radioiodinated AB-125I-LHR246–269 solution was mixed with 60 μl of 16% sucrose solution in PBS and fractionated on Sephadex Superfine G-10 column (0.6 × 15 cm) using PBS. Disposable glass tubes were siliconized under dimethyldichlorosilane vapor overnight and autoclaved. In each siliconized tube, 20 μl of PBS, hCG (70 ng in 10 μl of PBS), and 125I-LHR246–269 (100 ng in 10 μl of PBS) were mixed and incubated in 37 °C for 90 min. After incubation, 3 μl of 0.1 mm SES in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each tube and further incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by adding 3 μl of 5 mm Gly in PBS. The samples were boiled for 2 min in 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 8m urea. The solubilized samples were electrophoresed on 8–12% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Gels were dried on filter paper, then exposed to a molecular imaging screen (Bio-Rad) overnight. The imaging screen was scanned on a model GS-525 Molecular Imager System Scanner (Bio-Rad), and radioactive band intensity was analyzed using Image Analysis Systems Version 2.1 (Bio-Rad). Gels were exposed to X-Omat x-ray film at −75 °C for ∼4 days The following solutions were sequentially introduced to siliconized glass tubes: 20 μl of PBS, 10 μl of hCG (10 ng/μl) in PBS, and 10 μl of AB-125I-LHR246–269 (10 ng/μl) in PBS. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min in the dark, irradiated with Mineralight R-52 UV lamp for 3 min as described previously (41Ji I. Ji T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7167-7170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and solubilized in 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 8m urea. The samples were electrophoresed on 8–12% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Gels were dried on filter paper and processed as described above. Competitive inhibition experiments were carried out as described for the affinity cross-linking and photoaffinity labeling experiments, except that 10 μl instead of 20 μl of PBS was introduced to each tube, and the mixture was incubated with 10 μl of increasing concentrations of nonradioactive wild type or mutant LHR246–269. A human embryonic kidney 293 cell line stably expressing human LHR was incubated with 100,000 cpm of 125I-hCG in the presence of increasing concentrations of nonradioactive wild type or mutant LHR246–269 as described previously (42Ryu K.-S. Gilchrist R.L. Ji I. Kim S.-J. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7301-7304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After washing the cells several times, the radioactivity associated with the cells was counted to determine the K d value. LHR is encoded by 11 exons (22Koo Y.B. Ji I. Slaughter R.G. Ji T.H. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,43Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Xie X.Z. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11355-11359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the exodomain is primarily comprised of exons 1–10, whereas the endodomain is mainly encoded in exon 11. When exons 1–10 were expressed in mammalian cells after truncating exon 11, the exodomain fragment was trapped within the cells and could not be detected on the intact cell surface or in the culture medium (2Xie Y.B.

When the terminal region was further truncated by deleting both exons 10 and 11, the resulting exodomain fragment consisting of exons 1–9 was also trapped in cells and capable of hormone binding. The binding affinity was, however, significantly less as the K d value was ∼6-fold greater than that of the wild type receptor in detergent solution (Table I). This result suggests the presence of a potentially important site around the exon 9–10 boundary (36Hong S. Phang T. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol.

To screen important residues in the exon 9–10 junction of LHR, the junction sequence was aligned with the corresponding sequence of the FSH receptor and TSH receptor (Fig. 1).

We decided to Ala scan from Thr250 to Gln268 except Ala259 that was substituted with Gly. The resulting mutant receptors were stably expressed in cells and intact cells were assayed for125I-hCG binding and cAMP induction (Fig.2).

All of the latter were capable of binding hCG after solubilization in Nonidet P-40, indicating that Ala substitutions did not abolish the hCG binding activity and that the mutants were trapped in cells (36Hong S.

The K d values were generally higher than the wild type value except Cys257 → Ala and Phe260 → Ala, indicating lower affinities. The lower affinities do not appear to be due to the variations in the receptor concentration, because they are in the range of 22,000–57,000/cell, except for Thr252 → Ala and Phe260 → Ala. At these concentrations, the receptors show normal activities (9Ryu K. Gilchrist R.L. Tung C. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol.

It is interesting to note that all mutants in the second half of the sequence from Ala259 → Gly to Gln268→ Ala were expressed on the surface, whereas only four mutants from Thr250 to Cys258 were expressed on the surface. This result suggests that the first half, but not the second half, of the sequence may be important for receptor targeting to the cell surface. To further investigate the impact on surface expression, Tyr253 was substituted with an array of amino acids (Table II). The substitution of Phe did not impact the surface expression or the surface receptor concentration. In contrast, the His substitution significantly impaired the surface expression, and other substitutions blocked it. These results show that Tyr253 → Phe and a phenyl group at the Tyr253 position are permissible for receptor targeting and hormone binding. Therefore, the hydroxyl moiety of the Tyr's phenolic group does not appear to influence the targeting and hormone binding. The partial blockage of surface expression by the substitution of His suggests that an imidazole at the Tyr253 position is tolerable but not desirable. Substitutions of nonaromatic hydrophobic, hydrophilic, neutral, and acidic amino acids for Tyr253prevented surface expression of the receptor, although the concentration of the mutant receptors trapped in cells was significant and sometimes considerably higher than the total concentration of the wild type receptor. These results suggest that a phenolic or phenyl group is necessary at the Tyr253 position for efficient receptor transport to the surface membrane. To test this possibility and the essential role of Tyr253, the residue was deleted. The resulting Tyr253 deletion mutant was not expressed on the surface, supporting the hypothesis.Table IIMultiple substitutions for Tyr253Binding on cellBinding in solutioncAMP inductionK dReceptor/cellK dReceptor/cellEC50MaxpmpmpmfmolWild type430 ± 7040,000 ± 4,800810 ± 18045,000 ± 6,40093 ± 11140 ± 15Tyr253 → Phe460 ± 9033,900 ± 3,400820 ± 16042,800 ± 5,200155 ± 16151 ± 14Tyr253 → His470 ± 904,600 ± 600880 ± 17038,400 ± 5,100323 ± 298.5 ± 1Tyr253 → AlaNSNS930 ± 20052,100 ± 7,500NSNSTyr253 → ThrNSNS790 ± 15033,100 ± 4,100NSNSTyr253 → ValNSNS1,100 ± 20034,900 ± 4,500NSNSTyr253 → LeuNSNS950 ± 11041,000 ± 5,000NSNSTyr253 → GlnNSNS1,200 ± 22038,000 ± 4,800NSNSTyr253 → GluNSNS1,500 ± 30057,500 ± 9,000NSNSTyr253 → DelNSNS1,760 ± 32059,000 ± 9,100NSNSTyr253 was substituted with an array of amino acids.

In connection to the muscle growth-promoting activity of 1α,25(OH)2D3, various lines of evidence have shown that the hormone stimulates both the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes (28Bellido T.

Variations in cytosolic Ca2+ levels are also of importance in the control of the cell cycle (38Berridge M.J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In line with the participation of this mechanism, we recently obtained preliminary evidence indicating that in skeletal muscle cells tyrosine kinase phosphorylation of cellular proteins seems to play a role in 1α,25(OH)2D3-dependent modulation of non-genomic responses, such as fast increases in cytosolic Ca2+ and MAPK stimulation (39De Boland A.R. Vazquez G. Morelli S. Boland R. First International Meeting on Rapid Responses to Steroid Hormones, Mannheim, Germany, September 18–20. Mannheim University Press, Mannheim Germany1998: 90Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been recently reported that 1α,25(OH)2D3 rapidly stimulates MAP kinase phosphorylation in both promyelocytic NB4 leukemia cells (40Song X. Bishop J.E. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and enterocytes (41De Boland A.R. Norman A.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 470-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On these bases, in the present study we examined the participation of tyrosine kinase(s) in the mechanism by which 1α,25(OH)2D3 regulates cytoplasmic Ca2+ and exerts mitogenic effects in skeletal muscle cells and investigated hormone-dependent related changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation.RESULTSStimulation of chick embryonic skeletal muscle cells with 1α,25(OH)2D3 triggers a rapid (30 s) and sustained increment in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) that persists elevated as long as the cells are exposed to the hormone (Fig.1). We have previously shown that the rapid initial [Ca2+]i response to the sterol mainly results from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated mobilization of Ca2+ from a thapsigargin-sensitive store, whereas the plateau phase is entirely due to Ca2+ influx through VDCC and SOC channels (23Vazquez G. De Boland A.R. Boland R.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 239: 562-565Google Scholar, 24Vazquez G. De Boland A.R. Boland R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33954-33960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present study, to evaluate the participation of tyrosine kinase (TK) activity in the mechanism of muscle [Ca2+]i regulation by 1α,25(OH)2D3, we first examined the effect of TK inhibition on the hormone-generated variations in intracellular Ca2+. Pretreatment of myoblasts with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein (50–100 μm) and herbimycin (10–50 μm) completely prevented any subsequent response to 1α,25(OH)2D3 (Fig.2 A). The effects of both inhibitors on hormone-Ca2+ responses are likely to be due to suppression of TK activity. At the concentrations employed or higher (up to 370 μm), genistein has been previously shown not to alter cAMP-dependent kinase, protein kinase C (PKC), and phosphorylase kinase in other cell types (49Di Salvo J. Gifford D. Kokkinakis A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1988; 153: 388-394Google Scholar, 50O'Dell T.J. Kandel E.R. Grant G.N. Nature. 1991; 353: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 51Akiyama T.

Moreover, daidzein, an inactive analog of genistein, at concentrations as high as 100 μm did not block the increase in muscle [Ca2+]i caused by 1α,25(OH)2D3 (153 ± 10 and 162 ± 7 nm, for 1α,25(OH)2D3-treated cells in the absence and presence of daidzein, respectively, at the peak of the [Ca2+]i response; basal values were 98 ± 11 nm). Herbimycin inhibits protein-tyrosine kinases with higher selectivity than genistein (52Fukazawa H. Li P.M. Yamamoto C. Murakami Y. Mizuno A. Uehara Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1661-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 53Uehara Y. Fukazawa H. Murakami Y. Mizuno S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 163: 803-809Google Scholar). The addition of either inhibitor to the medium after the plateau phase of sterol-dependent changes in [Ca2+]ihad been reached did not affect further intracellular Ca2+levels (Fig. 2 B).Figure 1Changes in intracellular Ca2+levels ([Ca2+]i) induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3 in skeletal muscle cells. Cultured chick embryo skeletal muscle cells loaded with Fura-2 were exposed to 10−9m 1α,25(OH)2D3 (arrow) in Ca2+ (1.5 mm)-containing medium, and [Ca2+]i was determined, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A typical response to the hormone is seen with a fast rise in [Ca2+]i due to Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores and a sustained, long-lasting phase corresponding to the extracellular Ca2+ entry pathway.

In the presence of Ca2+ in the extracellular medium, 1 mm vanadate alone caused a more gradual increase in [Ca2+]i than the hormone, which reached a plateau level (1.5–2-fold above basal values) 3 min after its addition, whereas no changes were detected when a Ca2+-free medium was used (Fig.3 A). These observations suggest that in skeletal muscle cells, inhibition of tyrosine phosphatase activity promotes influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular millieu but not mobilization from endogenous stores. More important, the addition of vanadate to the sustained phase of the 1α,25(OH)2D3 [Ca2+]iresponse produced no modification in the level of Ca2+influx (Fig. 3 B). Conversely, adding the sterol to the medium after the vanadate response reached the steady state had no effect on such a response (data not shown). Besides its effects on tyrosine phosphatases, vanadate has been shown to inhibit the Ca2+-ATPase of plasma membrane (54Takahashi R. Watanabe H. Kakizawa H. Zhang X. Hayashi H. Ohno R. Jpn. Circ.

However, the possibility that the vanadate-induced increase in muscle cytosolic Ca2+ may be due to Ca2+-ATPase inhibition is unlikely under our experimental conditions as genistein pretreatment of cells markedly reduced the vanadate-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i (data not given).Figure 3Effect of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate on [Ca2+]i in skeletal muscle cells under basal conditions (A) and after 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment (B). A, cultured chick embryo skeletal muscle cells loaded with Fura-2 were exposed to 1 mmvanadate (arrow) in Ca2+-containing (1.5 mm, continuous trace) or Ca2+-free (<1 nm, dotted trace) medium, and [Ca2+]i was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown are representative time-trace curves from 4 (+Ca2+) and 3 (−Ca2+) independent [Ca2+]i recordings. B, the cells were stimulated with 10−9m1α,25(OH)2D3, and the hormone-dependent [Ca2+]i response was monitored until the plateau (Ca2+ entry) phase was reached. Then 1 mm vanadate was added, and the measurement proceeded for an additional period of 5 min. The amplitude (%) of Ca2+ entry changes after the addition of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor was compared with the initial condition (hormone-induced plateau, 100%).

As shown in Fig. 4, immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of cell lysates with a polyclonal antiserum reactive with phosphotyrosine residues revealed that the hormone causes a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of various cellular proteins. The effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 were concentration-dependent, with maximal stimulation achieved at 1 nm. Significant changes in phosphotyrosine-containing proteins of relative molecular masses of 42–44, 65, and 127 kDa were observed in response to the hormone. Proteins of 140 and 20 kDa were also tyrosine-phosphorylated but to a lesser extent. The 1α,25(OH)2D3-induced increment of protein phosphorylation could be suppressed by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (50–100 μm).MAPK or extracellular signal-regulated kinase consists of 42- and 44-kDa isoforms and requires both tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation for activation (55Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgiel T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that 1α,25(OH)2D3 phosphorylates MAP kinase in muscle cells, the membranes from the experiments of Fig. 4 were stripped and reprobed with anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibody, which recognizes both the 42- and 44-kDa species of active phosphorylated MAP kinase. As shown in Fig. 5 A, MAPK co-migrated with the tyrosine-phosphorylated bands at an estimated molecular mass of 42/44 kDa. Marked increases in phosphorylation could be detected after treatment with 1 and 10 nm1α,25(OH)2D3; unlike the experiments of Fig.4, in which the films were sobreexposed to visualize minor changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation, basal MAPK levels were not detected when the anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibody was used. Genistein (100 μm) blocked to a great extent the maximal response observed at a hormone concentration of 1 nm (Fig.5 B).Figure 51α,25(OH)2D3phosphorylates MAP kinase in skeletal muscle cells. Cultured chick embryo skeletal muscle cells were exposed for 1 min to 0.1–10 nm 1α,25(OH)2D3 in the absence or presence of genistein (50–100 μm). The cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine (anti P-Tyr) antibody and protein A-Sepharose.

Fig. 6shows that the hormone significantly increased MAPK tyrosine phosphorylation within 30 s, with highest stimulation reached at 1–2 min; at 5 and 10 min, the action of 1α,25(OH)2D3 decayed.

To further investigate whether 1α,25(OH)2D3 stimulates MAP kinase activity, cells were exposed to the hormone followed by immunoprecipitation of the MAPK 42/44 kDa species with anti-phospho-MAPK antibody and assay of immunocomplexes for kinase activity in the presence of myelin basic protein as substrate. 1α,25(OH)2D3 rapidly increased MAPK activity with kinetics roughly comparable with that of phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 7 A, maximal stimulation was achieved after 1 min of exposure to 1α,25(OH)2D3; the hormone effects on enzyme activity fell between 2 and 10 min to control levels. Similarly to MAP kinase phosphorylation, the 1α,25(OH)2D3-dependent increase in enzyme activity was completely abolished by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (Fig. 7 B).Figure 7Stimulation of chick skeletal muscle cell MAPK activity by 1α,25(OH)2D3.

The activity of HLA-DO is mediated through its interaction with the peptide editor HLA-DM. Here, our results demonstrate that although HLA-DO is absolutely dependent on its association with DM to egress the endoplasmic reticulum, the cytoplasmic portion of its β chain encodes a functional lysosomal sorting signal. By confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analysis, we show that reporter transmembrane molecules fused to the cytoplasmic tail of HLA-DOβ accumulated in Lamp-1+ vesicles of transfected HeLa cells. Mutagenesis of a leucine-leucine motif abrogated lysosomal accumulation and resulted in cell surface redistribution of reporter molecules. Finally, we show that mutation of the di-leucine sequence in DOβ did not alter its lysosomal sorting when associated with DM molecules. Taken together, these results demonstrate that lysosomal expression of the DO-DM complex is mediated primarily by the tyrosine-based motif of HLA-DM and suggest that the DOβ-encoded motif is involved in the fine-tuning of the intracellular sorting.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 259-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antigenic peptide-class II complexes are expressed on specialized antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and B lymphocytes. Following their synthesis, the α and β subunits of the class II molecule associate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) together with the invariant chain (Ii) (2Kvist S. Wiman K. Claesson L. Peterson P.A. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1982; 29: 61-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The latter folds in part through the groove of the class II molecule, stabilizing the αβ heterodimer and preventing the undesirable binding of ER polypeptides (3Roche P.A. Cresswell P. Nature. 1990; 345: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 4Romagnoli P. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 5Stumptner P.

Studies using mice with inactivated Ii genes suggested that Ii is necessary for efficient exit of newly synthesized class II molecules from the ER (7Bikoff E.K. Huang L.-Y.

However, it was later demonstrated that high levels of class II molecules reach the surface of Ii− dendritic cells (9Rovere P. Forquet F. Zimmermann V.S. Trucy J. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Davoust J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 417: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, transfected cells express a substantial amount of class II molecules at their plasma membrane even in the absence of Ii (10Sekaly R.-P. Tonnelle C. Strubin M. Mach B. Long E.O. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1490-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Such a phenotype probably results from the binding of endogenous peptides or polypeptides present in the ER (6Busch R. Cloutier I. Sekaly R.-P. Hammerling G.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Runnels H.A. Weber D.A. Moore J.C. Westerman L.E. Jensen P.E. Mol.

Romagnoli P. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2061-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Another function of Ii is to direct efficiently MHC class II molecules to the endocytic antigen-loading compartments (13Bakke O.

Two short leucine-based sequences located in the cytoplasmic tail of Ii are responsible for trafficking through the endocytic pathway (16Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 17Pieters J. Bakke O. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 831-846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar motifs in many proteins are specifically recognized at the cell surface and trans-Golgi by elements of the sorting machinery (reviewed in Ref. 18Heilker R. Spiess M. Crottet P. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Once the class II-Ii complex reaches the endosomal compartments, the invariant chain is progressively degraded by various proteinases depending on the cell type (19Nakagawa T.Y. Rudensky A.Y. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A residual class II-associated Ii peptide (CLIP) must be removed from the peptide-binding groove to allow the binding of an antigen and the subsequent export of the MHC molecule to the cell surface (20Ericson M.L. Sundstrom M. Sansom D.M. Charron D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26531-26538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jensen P.E. Weber D.A. Thayer W.P. Westerman L.E. Dao C.T. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Removal of the CLIP is catalyzed by the non-classical HLA-DM heterodimer (22Denzin L.K. Robbins N.F. Carboy-Newcomb C. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 595-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 23Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M.

This intracellular chaperone plays three critical roles in antigen presentation as it facilitates the withdrawal of the residual CLIP peptide and stabilizes the empty class II prior to peptide loading (25Denzin L.K.

This loading occurs in late endosomal vesicles and, in particular, in the MHC class II-rich compartments (29Neefjes J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, it was demonstrated that HLA-DM functions as a peptide editor limiting the repertoire of peptides bound to the class II molecule (23Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 30Kropshofer H. Vogt A.B. Moldenhauer G. Hammer J. Blum J.S. Hammerling G.J.

In this matter, HLA-DM favors the loading of high affinity peptides.The activity of HLA-DM is regulated by another non-classical class II molecule called HLA-DO. Experiments using purified complexes demonstrated the ability of DO to inhibit DM-mediated CLIP release (33Denzin L.K. Sant'Angelo D.B. Hammond C. Surman M.J. Cresswell P. Science. 1997; 278: 106-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,34Van Ham S.M. Tjin E.P.M. Lillemeir B.F. Gruneberg U. Van Meijgaarden K.E. Pastoors L. Verwoerd D. Tulp A. Canas B. Rahman D.

Furthermore, it was shown in transfected class II+cells that overexpression of HLA-DO alters the peptide repertoire bound to class II molecules and caused the accumulation of CLIP. Subsequent studies demonstrated that HLA-DO regulates the activity of HLA-DM by limiting the pH range and thus probably the endosomal compartments, where HLA-DM is active (35Liljedahl M. Winqvist O. Surh C.D. Wong P. Ngo K. Teyton L. Peterson P.A. Brunmark A. Rudensky A.Y. Fung-Leung W.P. Karlsson L.

Based on these results and on experiments using H-2Oα knock-out mice, it was proposed that H-2O and HLA-DO favor presentation of antigens internalized by membrane immunoglobulins. This would be achieved by the selective inhibition of H-2M and HLA-DM in endocytic compartments rich in proteins internalized by fluid-phase endocytosis (35Liljedahl M. Winqvist O. Surh C.D. Wong P.

However, the group of Hämmerling (37Kropshofer H. Vogt A.B. Thery C. Armandola E.A. Li B.C. Moldenhauer G. Amigorena S. Hammerling G.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) suggested that HLA-DO is not involved in the release of CLIP but rather edits the repertoire of class II-bound peptides by chaperoning empty DR molecules through its interaction with HLA-DM. In addition to the controversial DM-related functions of HLA-DO, its role in classical class II-negative thymic epithelial cells remains elusive (38Douek D.C. Altmann D.M. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).In HeLa cells and in murine B lymphocytes, under the experimental conditions tested so far, HLA-DO was shown to be totally dependent of its association with HLA-DM to egress the ER (39Liljedahl M. Kuwana T. Fung-Leung W.P. Jackson M. Peterson P.A. Karlsson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4817-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The complex then moves through the Golgi network and traffics to endocytic compartments. Although the cytoplasmic tail of HLA-DM contains a functional tyrosine-based motif needed for its own targeting to lysosomal compartments (40Marks M.S. Roche P.A. van Donselaar E. Woodruff L.

Immunology. 1998; 93: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the sorting signals responsible for the intracellular localization of the DO-DM complex have not yet been characterized. Indeed, we have recently proposed that the HLA-DOβ chain might also contain a sorting motif to the endocytic pathway (44Samaan A. Thibodeau J. Mahana W. Castellino F. Cazenave P.A. Kindt T.J. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In these experiments, a mixed isotypic pair between the classical DRα chain and a recombinant DR/DOβ chain specifically accumulated in lysosomal compartments of transfected HeLa cells. This phenotype was imparted by the DOβ chain since the wild-type DRα-DRβ heterodimer could only be detected at the cell surface. In the present report, we have used chimeric reporter molecules and site-directed mutagenesis to determine 1) the domain localization of the DOβ-encoded lysosomal sorting motif, 2) the exact nature of this sorting signal, and 3) its role in the trafficking of the DO-DM complex.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmidsRSV.5neo DRαTM (45Robadey C.

Long.pBS DRβ008 was generated by inserting the BamHI insert of 45.1 DRβ008 into pBluescript KS+ vector (Stratagene). pBS DOα.9 was generated by inserting the SalI-PstI fragment of RSV.5gptDN1 into pBluescript KS+ vector. This was then subcloned in RSV.5 neo by digesting withSalI/XbaI to generate RSV.5neoDOα. To construct pBS DOβ, a BamHI-fragment from 45.1 DOβ was inserted into pBluescript KS+ vector. Before cloning HLA-DOα/β gene into pBudCE4 vector (Invitrogen, CA), we integrated a β-lactamase gene, which allows for selection by resistance to ampicillin, by inserting a 1-kilobase pair fragment from pBluescript KS+ digested with BspHI/blunt-ended intoNheI/blunt-ended site of pBudCE4 (pBudCE4-A). The HLA-DOβ cDNA was then cloned into pBudCE4-A by digesting pBS DOβ withSalI-XbaI. The HLA-DOα cDNA was inserted in the same vector by cutting pBS DOα.9 with BamHI and cloning the fragment into the BglII site of the vector (pBudCE4-A DOα/β). The DOβ cDNA in 45.1 was excised withBamHI, and the 1.3-kilobase pair fragment was cloned in RSV.5neo plasmid to generate RSV.5neoDOβ.In order to generate the p305 DOβLL242-243AA, several subcloning steps were done to insert a unique HindIII restriction site in a 5′-position of the gene. The first step consisted in subcloning a 5′ portion of the RSV.5neoDOβ, which contained a HindIII site, in the RSV.3DOβLL242–243AA vector by aMluI/EcoRV digestion. From this construct, aHindIII fragment containing DOβLL242-243AA was then subcloned into p305 expression vector from which we had previously excised a XbaI stuffer to finally yield p305DOβLL242-243AA plasmid.DOβ Mutagenesis and Construction of the DR18/DOβ MoleculesIntroduction of mutations into the DOβ cytoplasmic tail cDNA sequence was performed by PCR overlap extension (50Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6795) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 5′ PCR product was generated from RSV.3 DR18/DOβ using the RSV LTR primer (5′ to the coding region) and a mutagenic primer which included the desired mutation as well as a unique restriction site used to identify clones harboring the mutation (DOβY227ABspE1b, 5′-CGT CCGGAC AGC TCC TTT CTG-3′; DOβT230LPstIb, 5′-C AGA CAT CTG CAG CCT CAC ATA-3′; DOβLL242–243AAXbaIb, 5′-TGA CTG AGG GGC CGC AAC AGC TCT AGA GAC-3′). The 3′ PCR product was generated using the complementary mutagenic primers (DOβY227ABspEIc, 5′-CAG AAA GGA GCT GTCCGG ACG-3′; DOβT230LPstIc, 5′-TAT GTG AGG CTG CAG ATG TCT G-3′; and DOβLL242–243AAXbaIc, 5′-GTC TCT AGA GCT GTTGCG GCC CCT CAG TCA-3′) and DRβ008 3′ (5′-ACT CGA TCT TTG AGA AAC ATT-3′) which hybridized to the non-coding 3′ end of the cDNA. The two overlapping PCR products were mixed, and a final PCR was performed using the flanking primers. This product was subsequently subcloned into SacI and HindIII sites of RSV.3 DOβ, thereby replacing the wild-type fragment with the PCR product containing the various mutations. The nucleotide sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing using T7 polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) before the mutations were introduced into RSV.3 DR18/DOβ (RSV.3 DR18/DOβT230L, RSV.3 DR18/DOβY227A, RSV.3 DR18/DOβLL242–243AA) by replacing the EcoRV-HindIII fragment with the equivalent fragment from mutated DOβ cDNA in RSV.3 described above. Underlined nucleotides in primer sequences correspond to mutations introduced in the PCR products.DR/DOβcyto and DR/DMβcyto Reporter MoleculesThe cytoplasmic tail of HLA-DRβ was replaced by that of either HLA-DOβ or HLA-DMβ. To construct RSV.3 DR/DOβcyto chimeric reporter molecule, we used the PCR overlap extension method. A first fragment was amplified from RSV.3 DRβ008 using the RSV-LTR primer and a mutagenic primer overlapping the end of the DRβ transmembrane and the N-terminal region of the HLA-DOβ cytoplasmic tail (oligonucleotide DRβ/DOβCyto222BssHIIb, 5′-ATA TCC TTT CTG CGC GCG GAA GTA GAT GAA C-3′). A second reaction was made on RSV.3 DR18/DOβ using a complementary fusion primer (DRβ/DOβCyto222BssHIIc, 5′-G TTC ATC TAC TTC CGC GCG CAG AAA GGA TAT-3′) and the DRβ008 3′ primer. Following the overlap reaction, the PCR product was subcloned into StuI and HindIII sites of RSV3 DRβ008. In order to introduce mutations in the cytoplasmic tail of the chimeric molecule, we used a similar strategy to the one described above but used RSV.3 DR18/DOβ T230L and RSV.3 DR18/DOβLL242–243AA plasmids as templates for the amplification of the DOβ cytoplasmic regions. Briefly, the DRβ portion was amplified from pBS DRβ008 with the reverse primer and DRβ/DOβCyto222BssHIIb primer which makes the junction between DRβ and DOβ cytoplasmic regions. The mutated DOβ cytoplasmic region was amplified from the RSV.3 DR18/DOβ mutant with complementary fusion primer DRβ/DOβCyto222BssHIIc and the DRβ008 3′ primer. The product of the overlapping reaction was digested with StyI to generate a fragment containing the mutated DR/DOβcyto fusion region and subcloned into StyI-digested pBS DRβ008 to replace the wild-type sequence. The resulting construction was sequenced, excised with BamHI, and subcloned into the SRα vector (51Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which allows for selection by resistance to puromycin (puroSRα was kindly provided by Dr. François Denis). To generate SRα puro DR/DOβcytoY227A, a different strategy was used. A first PCR product was made from RSV.3 DR18/DOβ using the RSV-LTR primer and the mutagenic primer (DOβY227ABspE1b, 5′-CGT CCGGAC AGC TCC TTT CTG-3′). The second PCR product was done using the complementary mutagenic primer (DOβY227ABspE1c, 5′-CAG AAA GGA GCT GTCCGG ACG-3′) and DRβ008 3′. The overlapping PCR product was subcloned into StyI of pBS DRβ008 to replace the wild-type sequence. The resulting construct was sequenced, excised withBamHI, and cloned into the SRα vector as above. In order to generate the triple mutant DR/DOβcytoLL242–243AA/T230L, we performed two successive overlap PCRs. The first overlap PCR was done as described above to generate a DR/DOβcytoLL242–243AA PCR fragment. By using the latter PCR product as a template, we subsequently introduced the third mutation at position T230L. The 5′ overlap fragment was amplified with the reverse primer and the DOβT230LPstIb primer. The 3′ fragment was obtained using DOβT230LPstIc primer and the universal primer. Following the overlap reaction, the PCR product was subcloned intoStyI of pBS DRβ008 to replace the wild-type sequence. The resulting construct was sequenced, excised with BamHI, and cloned into the SRα vector (SRα puro DR/DOβcytoAA/T230L).In order to make a fusion between the DRβ and DMβ cytoplasmic tails, we first cloned the HLA-DMβ cDNA from Raji cells by PCR. Total mRNA was extracted using TRIZOL Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10 μg was used for cDNA synthesis in the presence of the DMβ5′SalI (5′-CTG GAA GAG CTG GTC GAC GGG ACT G-3′) and the DMβ3′EcoRI (5′-GAA GTT GTA GAA TTC TGC CTC TAG-3′) oligonucleotides. The first strand cDNA was made using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Taq polymerase at 42 °C for 15 min in Taq polymerase buffer (BIO/CAN, Canada). Double-stranded cDNA was then amplified by PCR for 20 cycles, digested with SalI-EcoRI, and cloned in pBluescript KS+ (pBS 1-DMβ.1). The complete DNA coding sequence was verified by sequencing, and the predicted amino acids sequence corresponds to the published sequence (52Kelly A.P. Monaco J.J. Cho S. Trowsdale J. Nature. 1991; 353: 571-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).In order to mutate tyrosine 230 in the DMβ cytoplasmic region, a first PCR was performed on pBS 1-DMβ.1 using the reverse primer and a mutagenic primer (DMβY230AEco47IIIb, 5′-AGG AAG AGG AGTAGCGCT AGA GTG GCC AGC-3′). A second fragment was amplified from pBS 1-DMβ.1 using a complementary mutagenic primer (DMβY230AEco47IIIc, 5′-GCT GGC CAC TCT AGCGCT ACT CCT CTT CCT-3′) and the universal primer. The two overlapping PCR products were mixed, and a final PCR was completed using the flanking primers. This PCR product was subsequently digested with SacI and HindIII, cloned into pBS 1-DMβ.1, and sequenced (pBSDMβY230A).Fusion of the DMβ cytoplasmic tail to the DRβ transmembrane domain was performed by PCR. A first fragment was amplified from pBS DRβ008 using the reverse primer and a fusion primer (DRβ/DMβcytob, 5′-GA GTG GCC AGC TCT GAA GTA GAT GAA CAG-3′), which makes the junction between the DRβ and DMβ cytoplasmic regions. The DMβ cytoplasmic region was amplified from pBS 1-DMβ.1 with a complementary fusion primer (DRβ/DMβcytoc, 5′-CTG TTC ATC TAC TTC AGA GCT GGC CAC TC-3′) and the universal primer. The overlap product was digested withStyI-XbaI to generate a fragment containing the DR/DMβcyto fusion region and subcloned into pBS DRβ008. The resulting cDNA was sequenced, excised with BamHI, and cloned into the BamHI site of SRα puro vector (SRα puro DR/DMβcyto). In order to generate a DMβ cytoplasmic tail mutated at position Y230A and fused to the DRβ molecule, we used a similar strategy to the one described above but using pBS DMβY230A as template (instead of wild-type pBS 1-DMβ.1) for the amplification of the DMβ cytoplasmic region.AntibodiesL243 monoclonal antibody (IgG2a) binds a specific DRα conformational determinant (53Panina-Bordignon P.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent, St.-Bruno, Quebec, Canada), and appropriate selective agents (see below). HeLa cells were co-transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described (57Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6475) Google Scholar) using 2 μg of truncated DRα cDNA (DRαTM) along with 10 μg of the different β chain chimeras. Independently, duplicate transfections were done using Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Selective agents were added to a final concentration of 500 μg/ml G-418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 400 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), 50 units/ml hygromycin (Cederlane Laboratories, Ontario, Canada) or 100 μg/ml Zeocin™ (Cayla, Toulouse, France). Cells expressing the desired class II molecules were sorted using magnetic beads (Dynal Inc.) coated with L243 monoclonal antibody, except for HeLa DR/DMβcyto which was cloned by limiting dilutions, and for the HeLa DRαTM+DRβ, HeLa DR/DOβcyto T230L, HeLa DR/DOβcyto AA/T230L, HeLa DM.5/DOα+DOβ, HeLa DM.5/DOα+DOβAA cells which represent unsorted populations. The nature of the different reporter molecules expressed in transfected cells was confirmed by Western blot using antibodies specific for the different cytoplasmic tails (data not shown).Flow Cytometry AnalysisCell Surface StainingCells were harvested using trypsin, washed and incubated with FITC-conjugated L243 antibody or L243-bio in complete medium. After 45 min at 4 °C, cells were washed twice in PBS, and L243-bio-stained cells were incubated for another 45 min at 4 °C with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (SA-PE) in PBS. Cells were washed twice in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACS® caliber (Becton Dickinson). As negative control, cells were stained using only FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Cerderlane, Canada) or SA-PE (Coulter, Ontario, Canada).Intracellular StainingCells were harvested using trypsin, rinsed in PBS, and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After two washings in PBS, cells were treated with 50 mm NH4Cl for 15 min in 0.05% saponin (Sigma) in PBS containing 1% BSA (Bioshop, Canada). Intracellular staining was performed using L243-FITC. After 30 min at room temperature, cells were washed twice, fixed in 1% formaldehyde, and analyzed by flow cytometry. As negative control, untransfected HeLa cells were stained under the same conditions. In order to analyze by flow cytometry the total (surface and intracellular) versus surface expression of the various class II molecules, the profiles obtained for DR1 were first precisely superimposed, and the other samples of transfected cells were acquired under the same exact settings.

https://openalex.org/W2095246653,"Lymphoma proprotein convertase (LPC) is a subtilisin-like serine protease of the mammalian proprotein convertase family. It is synthesized as an inactive precursor protein, and propeptide cleavage occurs via intramolecular cleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast to other convertases like furin and proprotein convertase-1, propeptide cleavage occurs slowly. Also, both a glycosylated and an unglycosylated precursor are detected. Here we demonstrate that the unglycosylated precursor form of LPC is localized in the cytosol due to the absence of a signal peptide. Using a reducible cross-linker, we found that glycosylated pro-LPC is associated with the molecular chaperone BiP. In addition, we show that pro-LPC is prone to aggregation and forms large complexes linked via interchain disulfide bonds. BiP is associated mainly with non-aggregated pro-LPC and pro-LPC dimers and trimers, suggesting that BiP prevents aggregation. Overexpression of wild-type BiP or a dominant-negative BiP ATPase mutant resulted in reduced processing of pro-LPC. Taken together, these results suggest that binding of BiP to pro-LPC prevents aggregation, but results in slower maturation.

Activation requires the endoproteolytic cleavage of their propeptides, usually carboxyl-terminal of a basic motif composed of two or more basic residues. In 1990, the prototype of the mammalian enzyme family responsible for this activation step, furin, was discovered (1Van de Ven W.J. Voorberg J. Fontijn R. Pannekoek H. van den Ouweland A.M. van Duijnhoven H.L. Roebroek A.J. Siezen R.J. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1990; 14: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 2Roebroek A.J. Schalken J.A.

Since then, six additional members of this proprotein convertase (PC)1 family have been isolated: PC1 (also called PC3), PC2, PC4, PACE4, PC5 (also called PC6), and lymphoma proprotein convertase (LPC; also called PC7 or PC8) (reviewed in Refs. 3Van de Ven W.J.

Some members, like furin, PACE4, PC5, and LPC, exhibit a widespread tissue distribution, whereas the others have a more restricted expression pattern (6Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Day R. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). PC1 and PC2 are expressed in neuroendocrine cells, whereas expression of PC4 is restricted to germ cells. They all are multidomain enzymes composed of a conserved amino-terminal propeptide followed by a subtilisin-like catalytic and a middle domain. They diverge at the carboxyl terminus, although common elements like a cysteine-rich domain (present in furin, PACE4, and PC5) are found. Furin, LPC, and the PC6B isoform are type I transmembrane proteins, whereas the other convertases are soluble. The latest member of the family, LPC, was first discovered in the chromosome breakpoint region of a high-grade lymphoma carrying a t(11;14)(q23;q32) translocation (7Meerabux J. Yaspo M.L. Roebroek A.J. Van de Ven W.J. Lister T.A. Young B.D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 448-451PubMed Google Scholar). It is widely expressed, both during embryogenesis and adult life (8Constam D.B. Calfon M.

LPC is the least conserved family member, and phylogenetic analysis indicates that LPC is more related to kexin in yeast than to any other mammalian PC (12Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.

A key event in the maturation of PCs is the cleavage of the amino-terminal propeptide. This process has been found to be autocatalytic and intramolecular for furin (15Leduc R. Molloy S.S.

The requirement for sequences in the middle domain was illustrated recently in a patient with a multihormonal syndrome including severe childhood obesity. Two compound heterozygous mutations were found in the PC1 gene (25Jackson R.S. Creemers J.W. Ohagi S. Raffin-Sanson M.L. Sanders L. Montague C.T. Hutton J.C. O'Rahilly S. Nat.

In addition to a splice site mutation leading to a frameshift, a missense mutation (Gly → Arg) at the carboxyl terminus of the middle domain was found that prevented processing of pro-PC1 and led to retention in the ER. The only exception to this type of processing is PC2, which requires the presence of the molecular chaperone 7B2 for transport and activation, a process that takes place in the TGN (26Braks J.A.

The prosegments of both furin and LPC can act in trans as potent inhibitors of the enzymes themselves (33Zhong M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Benjannet S. Mowla S.J. Decroly E. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33913-33920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the case of furin, the cleaved propeptide remains associated with the enzyme during transport to the TGN, where a second internal cleavage of the propeptide is required for release and full activation of furin (34Anderson E.D. VanSlyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although this mechanism might apply to other PCs as well, LPC and PC4 lack such a second cleavage site marked by a cluster of basic residues. Activation of LPC must therefore follow an alternative pathway. This study was performed to obtain insight in the slow, autoproteolytic maturation of LPC in both transiently and stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We have analyzed the origin of the unglycosylated precursor form observed previously (10van de Loo J.-W. Creemers J.W. Bright N.A. Young B.D. Roebroek A.J. Van de Ven W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27116-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have used a cross-linking approach to identify proteins interacting with pro-LPC. Finally, we characterized the large aggregates of pro-LPC that are formed upon transient, but not stable, overexpression. The cloning of the 2.6-kilobase pair human LPC cDNA in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and the construction of the active-site serine mutant Lser (containing a S265A mutation) and the mutants LΔc and LΔtc have been described before (10van de Loo J.-W.

Mutant LΔc lacks the cytoplasmic tail of LPC, whereas mutant LΔtc also lacks the transmembrane anchor. Mutant LΔstc contains a stop codon six amino acids carboxyl-terminal of the end of the middle domain (VWSAVD-stop) and was constructed by cloning the following primer set in theAccI restriction site in LPC and the XbaI site in pcDNA3: 5′-AGACTAGCTCGAGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTAGACTCGAGCTAGT-3′ (antisense). Mutation of the second in-frame ATG codon to ATA (mutant Δatg2) was achieved using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the guidelines of the supplier, and the following mutagenic primers: 5′-GTTCCCTGGGTCATAGGCCTGGCAGGGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTCCCTGCCAGGCCTATGACCCAGGGAAC-3′ (antisense). Mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. The generation of the hamster BiP ATPase mutant (G37) has been described previously (35Hendershot L. Wei J. Gaut J. Melnick J. Aviel S.

The medium, serum, and supplements used for maintenance of cells were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Generation of the CHO-DHFR− cell line stably overexpressing LPC (CHO-LPC) has been described before (10van de Loo J.-W. Creemers J.W. Bright N.A. Young B.D. Roebroek A.J. Van de Ven W.J. J. Biol.

The cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium containing ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 250 μg/ml G418. CHO and COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. CHO and COS-1 cells were plated 1 day before transfection. Cells (8–10 × 105/10-cm2 culture plate) were transfected with 2 μg of DNA and 6 μl of Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used for experiments the next day. CHO-LPC cells were plated 1 day before the experiments. All experiments were performed at least twice. Cells (8–10 × 105/10-cm2culture plate) were starved for 1 h in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium and then labeled in the same medium containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and chased with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) for the times indicated in the figure legends. In the case of overnight labeling, 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum was added to the labeling medium, and starvation was omitted. Before lysis, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 10 min in 20 μm N-ethylmaleimide, a sulfhydryl-alkylating agent that blocks all free thiol groups. Lysis and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (10van de Loo J.-W. Creemers J.W. Bright N.A. Young B.D. Roebroek A.J. Van de Ven W.J. J. Biol.

For the experiments in Fig. 3 A, cells were lysed in 100 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% SDS and boiled for 5 min. Subsequently, the samples were diluted with 900 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% sodium deoxycholate and used for immunoprecipitation. In some cases, as indicated below, 10 mm DTT was added to the lysis buffer before boiling of the samples. Immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blots were incubated with 1:2000 dilutions of MP1 or anti-BiP polyclonal antibody, followed by incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako) and chemiluminescence detection (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells (8–10 × 105) were pulse-labeled for 20 min and subsequently snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. After quick thawing, the cytosol was gently washed out of the cells with 500 μl of PBS; and after one additional wash (discarded), the cells were lysed in 1 ml of the lysis buffer. The cell lysate contained all transmembrane proteins and about half of the soluble ER proteins (using glycosylated pro-LΔtc as marker protein for soluble ER proteins). The cytosol-containing extract was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was diluted 1:1 with the lysis buffer. Both fractions were used for immunoprecipitation as described above. Cross-linking with the reducible cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce) was performed essentially as described (36Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Cells (8–10 × 105/10-cm2 culture plate) were pulse-labeled for 2 h (transient transfections) or overnight (stable cell line) with [35S]methionine, unless indicated otherwise in the figure legends. Cells were placed on ice, washed with PBS, and incubated with N-ethylmaleimide as described above. Subsequently, cells were cross-linked in PBS containing 2 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (from a freshly made 20 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide) and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min on ice. The cross-linker was quenched with 20 mmglycine (final concentration), and the lysate was immunoprecipitated as described above. For the sequential immunoprecipitations carried out for Fig. 2, the Sepharose beads were boiled in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% SDS containing 10 mm DTT. The eluate was subsequently transferred to a clean tube; diluted in 900 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% sodium deoxycholate; and used for the second immunoprecipitation. Velocity sedimentation was performed based on a previously described protocol (37Simons J.F. Ferro-Novick S. Rose M.D. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cells (8–10 × 105) were lysed in 400 μl of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Complete medium, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and loaded on top of a 10–40% (w/v) linear sucrose gradient in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Gradients were centrifuged for 12 h at 45,000 rpm in an SW 55 rotor at 4 °C. 500-μl fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and either diluted 3-fold in PBS and used for immunoprecipitation or precipitated with 4 volumes of methanol and used for Western blotting. Pellets used for immunoprecipitation were resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% SDS; boiled for 5 min; and diluted with 900 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% sodium deoxycholate. Pellets used for Western blotting were resuspended in sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Parallel gradients containing 100 μg of bovine serum albumin or thyroglobulin were run as molecular markers. Aliquots of the fractions were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. In a previous study (10van de Loo J.-W. Creemers J.W. Bright N.A. Young B.D. Roebroek A.J. Van de Ven W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27116-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we noticed that biosynthesis of LPC occurred via an unusual pattern. At early time points, two bands of 92 and 102 kDa were observed, whereas at later time points, the 102-kDa protein disappeared with the concomitant increase of a 90–92-kDa band. The latter protein was shown to represent mature LPC, which lacks the propeptide of ∼100 amino acids. Deglycosylation experiments performed on samples from early time points revealed that both the 92- and 102-kDa bands represented pro-LPC, with the former one being unglycosylated. To elucidate the molecular basis of the unglycosylated form, we decided to analyze its subcellular localization. As shown in Fig. 1 (left panel), glycosylated pro-LPC was found exclusively in the crude membrane fraction, whereas the vast majority of unglycosylated LPC was found in the cytosol. This raised the question of whether the unglycosylated form had never been translocated into the lumen of the ER or if it had been retrotranslocated from the ER for ER-associated degradation in the cytosol (38Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2786) Google Scholar, 39Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3558) Google Scholar). We noticed that the ATG start codon does not contain a Kozak consensus sequence (CTGATGC in the LPC gene instead of G/A XXATGG) (38Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2786) Google Scholar). In contrast, the second methionine contains a favorable Kozak consensus sequence (GTCATGG). To determine if the second ATG codon might be utilized as a translation initiation codon, we substituted it for an isoleucine codon (ATA). This resulted in the total disappearance of the unglycosylated form (Fig. 1,right panel), showing that the unglycosylated pro-LPC detected in these transfections is the result of translation initiation at the second ATG codon. This methionine is located 35 amino acids carboxyl-terminal of the first methionine, two amino acids amino-terminal of the major signal peptide cleavage site, and five amino acids amino-terminal of the minor signal peptide cleavage site (11Munzer J.S. Basak A. Zhong M. Mamarbachi A. Hamelin J. Savaria D. Lazure C. Benjannet S. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19672-19681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Translation initiation at this ATG codon will result in the biosynthesis of a protein without a functional signal peptide. Therefore, it will not be translocated into the lumen of the ER or glycosylated. It will comigrate, however, with deglycosylated pro-LPC that has been translocated into the ER and whose signal peptide has been cleaved. Autoproteolytic cleavage of the propeptide of LPC is a slow process, with a half-life of >1 h. To obtain insight into the molecular basis for this slow maturation, we investigated potential interactions with molecular chaperones using chemical cross-linking. As shown in Fig. 2 (first panel), transiently transfected wild-type LPC and the active-site serine mutant Lser were cross-linked with a 78-kDa protein. The same result was achieved using a cell line stably expressing moderate amounts of LPC (Fig. 2,third panel), indicating that this interaction was not due to a high-level expression in transient transfections. The cross-linking with Lser showed that this interaction occurred in the ER since this mutant is autoprocessing-incompetent and therefore retained in the ER (10van de Loo J.-W. Creemers J.W. Bright N.A. Young B.D. Roebroek A.J. Van de Ven W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27116-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Based on its molecular mass, we speculated the identity of the protein to be BiP. BiP is a molecular chaperone that binds transiently to unfolded proteins and more stably to misfolded proteins (39Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3558) Google Scholar). Therefore, the experiment was repeated using an anti-BiP antibody (Fig. 2, second panel), which resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of a protein with the same electrophoretic mobility as pro-LPC, but not LPC. Final proof was obtained by sequential immunoprecipitations (Fig. 2, fourth panel). After the first immunoprecipitation with either anti-BiP or anti-LPC antibody, the samples were boiled under reducing conditions and immunoprecipitated with anti-LPC or anti-BiP antibody, respectively. Taken together, these results unequivocally demonstrate that BiP is noncovalently bound to pro-LPC. Subsequently, transient cotransfections of full-length LPC with the truncated mutant LΔc, which lacks the cytoplasmic domain of LPC, were performed (Fig. 3 A). The antibody KP1 is directed against Cys585–Ser604 in the cytoplasmic domain (10van de Loo J.-W. Creemers J.W. Bright N.A. Young B.D. Roebroek A.J. Van de Ven W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27116-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and therefore does not recognize LΔc. LΔc is, however, recognized by MP1, which is directed against Lys−2–Arg18 in the catalytic domain of LPC (10van de Loo J.-W. Creemers J.W. Bright N.A. Young B.D. Roebroek A.J. Van de Ven W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27116-27123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of cotransfected Lser and LΔc using MP1 (Fig. 3 A, fifth lane) showed the expected bands: pro-Lser (glycosylated and unglycosylated), pro-LΔc (glycosylated and unglycosylated), and processed LΔc. Lser was used in this experiment rather than LPC because processed LPC has only a slightly higher molecular mass than pro-LΔc, which might obfuscate the results. The use of Lser did not have any qualitative effect (compare with Fig. 3 B). When the immunoprecipitation was performed with KP1 (Fig. 3 A, sixth lane), which recognizes only pro-Lser, glycosylated pro-LΔc was found to coprecipitate. The observation that unglycosylated pro-LΔC and processed LΔc do not coprecipitate provides evidence that the coprecipitation of glycosylated pro-LΔc is not due to a post-lysis effect or direct binding of the antibody to pro-LΔc. This unexpected result suggests that pro-Lser and pro-LΔc form multimers or aggregates. To characterize the nature of the interactions, the cell extracts were boiled for 5 min in the presence or absence of 10 mm DTT before immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 3 A (last four lanes), heat denaturation of the sample was insufficient for dissociation of the complexes. The coimmunoprecipitated proteins were dissociated only when the samples were reduced. These data demonstrate that pro-LPC forms complexes linked via interchain disulfide bonds. Next, we investigated if coimmunoprecipitation was dependent on transmembrane anchorage of LPC or on the presence of the stalk domain, i.e. the region between the middle and transmembrane domains (Fig. 3 B). We also tried to obtain a first indication about the size of the complexes by transfecting three times less wild-type LPC than mutant cDNA. The fifth and sixth lanes confirm that the results obtained with Lser in Fig. 3 A are similar to those obtained with wild-type LPC. In addition, the sixth,eighth, and tenth lanes show more radiolabeled pro-LΔc, pro-LΔtc, and pro-LΔstc than pro-LPC. In other words, on average, >1 molecule is coimmunoprecipitated per molecule of pro-LPC, indicating the formation of complexes containing multiple LPC molecules. Finally, the last four lanes demonstrate that mutants missing both the stalk and transmembrane regions of LPC still form mixed-disulfide complexes with full-length LPC, suggesting that associations were mediated through the luminal domains of LPC. It should be noted that LΔstc displayed very limited processing even though it contained six amino acids in addition to the topologically equivalent minimal sequence required for maturation of furin (40Creemers J.W. Usac E.F. Bright N.A. van de Loo J.-W. Jansen E. Van de Ven W.J.M. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25284-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of this truncated mutant seemed to affect maturation of LPC as well since less of the 90–92-kDa form of LPC was observed. The coimmunoprecipitation experiments described above suggest the formation of aggregates. To obtain insight in the size of these aggregates, we analyzed cell extracts of both transiently and stably transfected CHO cells by velocity centrifugation on 10–40% sucrose gradients. Under steady-state conditions, the vast majority of LPC in the stably transfected cells (Fig. 4 A) was in the processed form, concentrated in the third fraction and, to a lesser extent, in fractions 2 and 4. Small amounts of pro-LPC were detected in fractions 3 and 4, with little or none in the bottom fractions. In parallel gradients, bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) was concentrated in fractions 2 and 3. This suggests that under these conditions, most of the pro-LPC and mature LPC (90–92 kDa) is in the monomeric form, although we cannot exclude that the extraction of the proteins from the cells has disrupted di- or multimeric forms, held together by weak interactions. In contrast, when the transiently transfected cells were examined in the same way (Fig. 4 B), only a small fraction of pro-LPC was detected in fractions 3 and"

The folylpolyglutamate products of this reaction are no longer substrates for cellular efflux mechanisms, so that folate cofactors accumulate in the cell to levels that drive metabolism. The folylpolyglutamates also are superior substrates for many folate-dependent enzymes (1Shane B. Vitam. Horm. 1989; 45: 263-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and the function of FPGS has been shown to be essential for the survival of dividing mammalian cells (2McBurney M.W. Whitmore G.F. Cell. 1974; 2: 173-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). FPGS is recognized to play a central role in the activity of cancer chemotherapeutic antifolates. Metabolism by FPGS increases their intracellular concentration, and their cytotoxicity is closely linked to this metabolism (3McGuire J.J. Hsieh P. Franco C.T. Piper J.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 2607-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). FPGS is expressed in mouse liver and kidney and all tumors and dividing cell lines (4Moran R.G. Colman P.D. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 326-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Sirotnak F.M. Johnson T.B. Samuels L.L. Galivan J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 4239-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); significant levels of mRNA for FPGS were not found in a scan of other mouse differentiated tissue (6Freemantle S.J. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25373-25379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, it was discovered that mouse liver and kidney express a different isozyme of FPGS than that found in normal and malignant dividing tissues (7Turner F. Andreassi J. Ferguson J. Titus S. Tse A. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar). We do not yet understand the physiological significance of these FPGS isoforms, but the mouse has evolved the tissue-specific expression of two subtly different enzyme species. The expression patterns from the two promoters have been well characterized in the mouse (7Turner F. Andreassi J. Ferguson J. Titus S. Tse A. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar, 8Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5587-5593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Two 5′ terminal exons, located 10 kb upstream from the body of the gene (8Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5587-5593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), are spliced to exon 2 in transcripts that are expressed only in a few differentiated tissues (7Turner F. Andreassi J. Ferguson J. Titus S. Tse A. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, any normal or neoplastic dividing tissues express transcripts that initiate at the downstream exon 1 (7Turner F. Andreassi J. Ferguson J. Titus S. Tse A. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, kidney contains both classes of transcripts. Mouse FPGS transcripts initiating at the upstream or downstream promoters have been shown to translate to isoforms of FPGS with different kinetic properties (7Turner F. Andreassi J. Ferguson J. Titus S. Tse A. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, a very tightly controlled mechanism has evolved to direct transcription from either the upstream or downstream promoters in the mouse, although the details of this mechanism are not yet clear. The human FPGS gene is located on chromosome 9 (9Chen L. Qi H. Korenberg J. Garrow T.A. Choi Y. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13077-13087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and was originally reported (10Taylor S.M. Freemantle S.J. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6030-6034PubMed Google Scholar) to have 15 exons spanning 11.2 kb of genomic DNA in an organization nearly identical to that found later for the downstream region of the mouse gene (11Roy K.

Gene. 2000; 242: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Others have reported that a complex set of transcriptional start sites exist in the vicinity of this downstream human promoter (9Chen L. Qi H. Korenberg J. Garrow T.A. Choi Y. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13077-13087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). An understanding of whether different FPGS isoforms are expressed in different human tissues is of paramount importance because of the ability of FPGS to activate drugs of potential therapeutic use in humans, particularly because the differences between mouse isoforms result in differences in substrate preference (7Turner F. Andreassi J. Ferguson J. Titus S. Tse A. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar). Such a difference in activation of cytotoxic drugs by different FPGS isozymes could potentially be used for targeting of drugs or modification of drug toxicity profiles (7Turner F. Andreassi J.

Others have suggested that human ALL cells, which are sensitive to methotrexate, and AML cells, which are refractory, express species of FPGS that differ in the kinetics of activation of methotrexate (13Longo G. Gorlick R. Tong W. Ercikan E. Bertino J. Blood. 1997; 90: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the work reported here, we sought to identify whether a mechanism similar to the one directing the expression of FPGS isozymes in different tissues of the mouse also exists in humans. We now report that the human FPGS gene contains two upstream exons similar to those of the mouse and that an alternative, functional human FPGS species can be produced from a transcript that includes only one of these exons. We found no molecular evidence for differences in primary sequence between the enzymes expressed in AML and ALL leukemias. When we evaluated the expression and functional significance of the multiple FPGS transcripts found in humans, a tissue-specific pattern of isozyme expression was not found, suggesting an evolutionary divergence in the control of FPGS expression between these two species. Human cell lines MOLT-3 (acute lymphocytic leukemia), K-562 (acute myelogenous leukemia), HL-60 (acute promyelocytic leukemia), and CEM (acute lymphocytic leukemia) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). AUXB1 cells were originally obtained from Dr. Gordon Whitmore of the Ontario Cancer Center. Poly(A)+ RNA from normal human liver pooled from two Caucasian males and from skeletal muscle from a pool of 10 males and females were purchased fromCLONTECH. The α modification of minimum Eagle's medium formulated with (α+) or without nucleosides (α−) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Poly(A)+ RNA from human liver (CLONTECH) was reverse transcribed with Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) or ThermoScript RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) using an antisense primer (a) (5′-ACTCCGTGCCAGGTACAGTTCCATG) in exon 2 (see Fig. 1 B) of the human FPGS gene. A polydeoxycytidylate tail was added with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, and PCR was performed using an internally nested antisense primer (b) (5′-GGTACAGTTCCATGGCTTCCAACTGTGTCTGAGGG) in exon 2 and a 5′ anchor primer. The resultant PCR products were amplified by an additional round of PCR using a second nested primer (c) (5′-AACTGTGTCTGAGGGTCAC) in exon 2 and the 5′ anchor primer. The cDNAs were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into Top10 One Shot cells (Invitrogen). Forty-five clones were manually sequenced using Sequenase 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To amplify exon A1b-specific clones, we applied a third nested primer (d) (5′-CTGGAAGGAGGCAGTTTTAGC) in exon A1b and the anchor primer to the nested PCR reaction mentioned above in one experiment, and we applied this primer pair directly to human liver cDNA reverse transcribed by primer a in exon 2 in a second experiment. A similar pattern of 5′-cDNA ends within exon A1b was noted in the two experiments. Lambda clones (λ21, λ22, λBL) were previously isolated from a human male placental genomic library (10Taylor S.M.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar) corresponding to mouse exons A1a/A1b sequence-linked to exons 2–4 was random primed with the RadPrime DNA labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.) and used to probe Southern blots of restriction endonuclease-cleaved λBL DNA. A λBL HindIII 4.0-kb fragment was subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). A Southern blot of this 4.0-kb subclone was subsequently probed with a γ-32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide (5′-GGAGGCAGTTTTAGCTGAGGAAGG) corresponding to human exon A1b (see Fig.1 A). The 1.1- and 1.8-kb NcoI fragments were subcloned into pGEM blue (Promega) to which NcoI linkers were added. Consensus binding sites for transcription factors were identified using the TFsearch v1.3 algorithm (Yutaka Akiyama, Kyoto University). A cDNA for a full-length cytosolic FPGS (pC-FPGS) (14Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9579-9584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) from human leukemia cells was treated with either EcoRI or HindIII to cut the 5′ multiple cloning site and BstEII, corresponding to a unique site in exon 2 of the FPGS gene. This cDNA was ligated to similarly restricted fragments for the various initial exons spliced to exon 2. These upstream fragments were generated as follows. 1) cDNA fragments initiated in the exon A1b sequence were generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR using random primed human liver RNA (CLONTECH) as a template and an editing mixture ofTaq and Vent polymerases. The sense primers included a HindIII site (italics) and either the upstream (5′-GTCTAAGCTTCAAGGGATGAAAGGTGCTGGGTCCCTGG) or downstream ATGs (bold) in exon A1b (5′-CCTTAAGCTTGGAACCATGGAGGGCCCATCTGGATATC) (see Fig. 1 A); the antisense primer (5′-ATGCCCCCTTTCTGCCATGC) was complementary to the exon 8 sequence. PCR products were cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) and verified by sequence analysis. The desired upstream HindIII and BstEII fragments were gel isolated. 2) The upstream fragments for exon 1c and 2a were constructed from 5′-RACE clones in pCRII. The exon 1c RACE clone was digested withHindIII and BstEII, and the exon 2a RACE clone was digested with EcoRI and BstEII. The exon 1, 1c, and 2a constructs initiated at nt 127, 315, and 1163, respectively (numbering is for the genomic DNA sequence relative to the upstream translational start site in exon 1). The exon A1b construct initiated at nt 67 relative to the upstream translational start site in exon A1b (see Fig. 1 B). Translation of functional enzyme from full-length cDNAs corresponding to the several FPGS transcripts in human liver was tested by transforming the constructs into FPGS-null AUXB1 cells. Expression constructs were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (7Turner F. Andreassi J. Ferguson J. Titus S. Tse A. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar, 14Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G. Moran R.G. J. Biol.

Selection in α+ or α− media with 1.2 mg/ml G418 was applied 48 h after transfection. In other experiments, cDNA constructs were transfected into AUXB1 cells plated at clonal densities (2 × 103 cells/100-mm dish), and the medium was changed to α+ with G418 to select only for stable transfectants. One isolated colony was picked from each dish and expanded. The phenotype of FPGS-expressing clones was tested by plating 120–150 cells/dish and then changing to selective media supplemented with either glycine or purine and thymidine. Colonies were fixed and stained after 10–14 days. 5′-RACE products corresponding to exons A1b, 1c, and 2a linked to exon 2 were cloned in pCRII and used to generate riboprobes and standard RNAs by in vitrotranscription. The exon A1b+2 probe contains the exon A1b sequence from the EcoRV site at nt 83 from the upstream ATG in exon A1b; all other nucleotide numbers in exons 1, 1c, 2a, and 2 are relative to the upstream ATG in exon 1 (see Fig. 1 B). The exon 1c+2 probe contains the sequence from the HinfI site at genomic nt 448–1469 in exon 2. The exon 2a+2 probe initiates at theAvaII site at nt 1314–1449 in exon 2. The exon 1+2 probe was transcribed from an EaeI/NcoI fragment (nt 104–1455) cloned into pGEM blue (Promega). RNA transcripts were generated from linearized cDNAs using [α-32P]UTP and either SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase. The full lengths of the undigested probes are as follows (in nt): exon 1+2, 194; exon A1b+2, 220; exon 1c+2, 222; and exon 2a+2, 214. The sense complement of each probe was transcribed in vitro and used as a standard for the mobility of a single molecular species that was a perfect match to the probe. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and poly(A)+ RNA was selected using an Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen). Ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) reactions containing deionized formamide, 1–2 × 105 cpm of probe, and 1–4 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were hybridized overnight, and 100 μg/ml RNase A was added for 30 min. The protected fragments were ethanol-precipitated and fractionated on a 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel. RPA conditions were as follows: exon 1+2 probe, hybridization at 50 °C and digestion in 300 mmsalt at 16 °C; exon A1b+2 probe, hybridization at 65 °C and digestion in 225 mm salt at 55 °C; exon 1c+2 probe, hybridization at 72 °C and digestion in 225 mm salt at 50 °C; exon 2a+2 probe, hybridization at 50 °C and digestion in 300 mm salt at 16 °C. The protected fragments of probe were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics), and data were corrected by the U content of each fragment to allow comparison of the molar proportions of expressed transcripts. Human liver, skeletal muscle, and CEM poly(A)+ RNAs (1 μg) were reverse transcribed with Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) and random hexamers. Genomic DNA was prepared from CEM cells by phenol-chloroform extraction. Primers from the human sequence homologous to mouse exon A1a (see Fig.2) were paired with primers in exons A1b and 2, using human liver, skeletal muscle, and CEM cDNA or human genomic DNA as templates and with additional antisense primers in exons 4 and 6 for human liver. In other experiments, sense primers from exon A1b were paired with antisense primers in exon 2, using human liver, skeletal muscle, and CEM cDNAs as templates to detect trace levels of transcripts containing exon A1b. Because mouse FPGS shows a tightly controlled, tissue-specific pattern of FPGS isozyme expression, we set out to define the distribution of FPGS transcripts in human tissues, initially focusing on liver. Using an antisense primer in exon 2, we reverse transcribed liver poly(A)+ RNA and amplified the resulting cDNA by PCR with an internally nested antisense primer specific to exon 2 (Fig. 1 B) and a 5′ anchor primer. These RACE products were ligated into pCRII, and 47 clones were sequenced (Table I). Among these clones, we detected a RACE product whose initial sequence was remarkably similar to that of mouse exon A1b (7Turner F. Andreassi J. Ferguson J. Titus S. Tse A. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar, 8Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5587-5593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). We previously demonstrated that the mouse exon A1b has mitochondrial and cytosolic translational start sites (7Turner F. Andreassi J. Ferguson J. Titus S. Tse A. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar) similar to what was reported for the human exon 1 (14Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9579-9584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mouse proteins initiating at the more downstream ATG in exon A1b encode cytosolic FPGS, whereas those initiating at the upstream ATG encode mitochondrial FPGS. Two triplets encoding methionine were conserved in the human exon A1b homolog at the identical position to the translational start codons encoded in mouse exon A1b (Fig. 1 A).Table IPercent of RACE clones containing alternative initial exons linked to exon 2Initial exonExperiment 1 1-aSequences of 24 clones were analyzed.Experiment 2 1-bSequences of 23 clones were analyzed.% of totalExon A1b114.3Exon 18425.5Exon 1b102.1Exon 1c14846.8Exon 2a01021.31-a Sequences of 24 clones were analyzed.1-b Sequences of 23 clones were analyzed. Open table in a new tab Two striking differences were noted from our experience with mouse liver FPGS gene expression. In contrast to the mouse, the human exon A1b homolog was infrequently represented in the RACE clones sequenced; 2 of 47 clones contained a human exon A1b homolog (Table I), whereas 10 of 11 mouse liver RACE clones contained exons A1a and A1b (7Turner F. Andreassi J. Ferguson J. Titus S. Tse A. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar). Secondly, human clones containing a sequence corresponding to mouse exon A1b did not extend into the sequence corresponding to mouse exon A1a (Fig. 1 B). We repeated the 5′ RACE on human liver poly(A)+ RNA using an antisense primer in exon A1b (Fig.1 B). For all 35 of the longest clone inserts sequenced, we again found only exon A1b and not the mouse exon A1a-homologous sequence. A search of the NCBI data base of expressed sequence tags for FPGS cDNAs found an exon A1b 5′ sequence extending to nt −102 (Fig. 1 A), but the adjacent sequence homologous to exon A1a was again not represented. Hence, RACE data suggested that upstream transcriptional initiation was infrequent in human hepatic tissue, and even then transcription began at a different start site than that used in the mouse. Several other 5′ termini were represented in the human liver FPGS RACE clones. As previously reported for human HepG2 hepatoma cells (9Chen L. Qi H. Korenberg J. Garrow T.A. Choi Y. Shane B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13077-13087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), these included transcripts containing the initial exons 1, 1b, and 1c and a new transcriptional start site, denoted exon 2a, all individually linked to exon 2 (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to the human A1b- and exon 1-containing RACE clones, which have translational start sites in-frame with exon 2, the exon 1b and 1c variants did not, suggesting that they either used a translational start site in exon 2 or did not allow translation of active enzyme. The initial sequence identified as exon 2a was contiguous with exon 2 in the genomic sequence (Fig.1 C) and could represent either an alternative transcriptional start site or unprocessed pre-mRNA, but it was similar to exon 1c in having stops in all three reading frames and no consensus translational start sites. Differences from the mouse FPGS gene (7Turner F. Andreassi J. Ferguson J. Titus S. Tse A. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar) were apparent; exon 1-containing human RACE products were common, even in liver, and transcripts without a clear translational start site were abundant in these RACE products. Because we had detected a sequence homologous with mouse exon A1b in FPGS transcripts from human liver (Fig. 1 A), we sought to place this alternative initial exon on the map of the human genomic locus. We had previously mapped the human FPGS gene using the overlapping λ clones diagrammed in Fig.2 A (10Taylor S.M. Freemantle S.J. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6030-6034PubMed Google Scholar). Because exons A1a and A1b were located 10 kb upstream of exon 1 in the mouse FPGS locus (8Roy K. Mitsugi K. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5587-5593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we looked for the human A1b sequence on λBL, which extended upstream of exon 1 by ∼15 kb. When we initially probed Southern blots of λBL with a mouse A1a/A1b-containing RACE clone, a 4.0-kb HindIII fragment hybridized, which was 6.5 kb upstream of human exon 1 (Fig.2 A). We subcloned the HindIII 4.0-kb fragment and probed a Southern blot of this subclone with an end-labeled 24-nt primer from the human A1b sequence; a 1.1-kb NcoI fragment hybridized (Fig. 2 B). Direct sequencing of the 1.1-kbNcoI fragment, an adjacent 1.8-kb NcoI fragment, and this region of the HindIII 4.0-kb fragment mapped the human A1b homolog (Fig. 2 A). Every 5′ RACE cDNA clone we sequenced that contained the human A1b homolog lacked sequence homologous to mouse exon A1a. However, when we inspected the human genomic DNA sequence upstream of exon A1b, surprisingly, there was a region of striking homology with mouse exon A1a (Fig. 2 C). This sequence was located 112 nt upstream of human exon A1b; the mouse intron between A1a and A1b was 124 nt. Several PCR primers in the human genomic region homologous to mouse exon A1a were designed (Fig. 2 C). Using these primers with antisense primers in exons A1b, 2, 4, or 6, we could not PCR-amplify any products containing A1a linked to downstream exons in cDNA reverse transcribed from human liver. Similar results were found in skeletal muscle and CEM RNA. However, the A1a/A1b primer pairs amplified the appropriate intervening human genomic DNA sequence (data not shown). We concluded that the human homolog to the mouse exon A1a does not exist in mRNA from CEM leukemic cells or from normal human liver or skeletal muscle. Mouse exon A1a contains only a 5′ untranslated sequence (7Turner F. Andreassi J. Ferguson J. Titus S. Tse A. Taylor S.M. Moran R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6074-6079PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, the proteins encoded by transcripts initiating at upstream exon(s) in the mouse and the human would not be expected to differ in length at the amino-terminal end. The omission of exon A1a in human FPGS transcripts suggests that there are major variations between the human and mouse upstream promoters, resulting in different transcriptional start sites. We sought to define the intracellular role of any proteins encoded by each of the several FPGS transcripts detected in human liver. The Chinese hamster ovary-derived cell line AUXB1 contains an inactivating point mutation in the FPGS gene 2S. A. Titus, J. K. Ferguson, and R. G. Moran, unpublished observations. and, therefore, cannot survive in the absence of thymidine, purines, and glycine (2McBurney M.W. Whitmore G.F. Cell. 1974; 2: 173-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). cDNAs containing human FPGS exons 1, A1b, 1c, or 2a individually linked to exons 2–15 were cloned into pcDNA3 and transfected into AUXB1 cells. Transfection of the exon 1 construct served as a positive control (14Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9579-9584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and transfection of pcDNA3 alone was the negative control. As seen in Fig.3, only the exon 1 and exon A1b constructs complemented the FPGS-null phenotype in the absence of nucleosides (α− medium). Constructs containing exon 1c linked to exons 2–15 did not complement the AUXB1 phenotype. In a separate but identically designed set of experiments, transfection of exon 2a constructs into AUXB1 cells also did not yield colony growth in α− medium (Fig. 3). These results ruled out the possibility of initiation of translation of active FPGS from a cryptic translational start site in exons 1c or 2a or translation of active enzyme from a methionine in exon 2. Similarly to human exon 1 and mouse exon A1b, human exon A1b also encodes an RNA transcript that contains two in-frame potential start methionines (Fig. 1 A). Freemantle et al. (14Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9579-9584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the species of human FPGS translated from the downstream start codon in human exon 1 (Fig. 2 A) complemented the thymidine and purine auxotrophy of AUXB1 cells but not the glycine requirement and that FPGS translated from the upstream codon complemented the glycine auxotrophy of these cells. These functions were equated to the cytosolic and mitochondrial components of folate metabolism, and the 42 codons between the two AUGs encode a mitochondrial leader sequence. We sought to determine whether human exon A1b also encodes cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of FPGS. AUXB1 cells were transfected with constructs initiating at either of the ATGs in exon A1b and continuing through exon 15. Several independent clones of cells stably transfected with the exon 1-, A1b-, and 1c-containing constructs were selected in α+ medium containing G418, mass-cultured in this non-selective medium, and used to determine the sub-cellular biochemical function of any species of FPGS produced by plating 200 cells in either α+ medium, α− medium, or α+ medium formulated without glycine. The resultant colony growth (TableII) demonstrated that constructs initiating with the exon 1c sequence supported neither mitochondrial nor cytosolic folate metabolism, whereas the constructs initiating at the first ATG in exons A1b and 1 supplied the glycine requirement of AUXB1, and those starting at the second ATG of both exons allow growth in the absence of nucleosides but not in the absence of glycine. Hence, we have established in vivo that the human exon A1b-initiated FPGS transcripts encode two functional forms of FPGS, as do those initiating with exon 1 (14Freemantle S.J. Taylor S.M. Krystal G.

Although many of the gp130-activated cytoplasmic signaling pathways have now been described, the mechanisms through which these pathways influence downstream factors that bind DNA and thus regulate transcription in response to the gp130 cytokines are not as well characterized. VIP is expressed in specific regions of the brain and the peripheral nervous system (33Gozes I. Shani Y. Rostene W.H.

Likewise, these cytokines induce an 8–10-fold increase in VIP mRNA levels in the neuroblastoma cell line NBFL (36Symes A.J. Rajan P. Corpus L. Fink J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8068-8075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). By analyzing successive deletions of the VIP promoter upstream of a luciferase reporter, we were able to map a 180-bp cytokine response element (CyRE) 1.15 kilobases upstream of the VIP transcription start site, which mediates the transcriptional response to CNTF in NBFL cells (37Symes A.J.

We have previously reported that there are functional STAT and AP-1 sites within the VIP CyRE (36Symes A.J. Rajan P. Corpus L. Fink J.S. J. Biol.

CNTF treatment of NBFL cells activates STAT and AP-1 proteins to bind two distinct sites within the CyRE (38Symes A.J. Lewis S.E. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1750-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Symes A.J. Gearan T. Eby J. Fink J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9648-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mutation of the STAT site within the wild-type CyRE reduces CNTF induction of CyRE transcription by ∼80% (38Symes A.J. Lewis S.E. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1750-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the AP-1 site alone reduces CNTF-mediated induction by ∼50% (40Symes A.J. Gearan T. Eby J. Fink J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9648-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting that both these sites are important to the CNTF induction of VIP transcription through the CyRE. However, our previous deletion studies of the VIP CyRE suggested that an additional region in the 3′-CyRE, distinct from the STAT and AP-1 sites, also contributes considerably to CNTF-mediated induction of CyRE-directed transcription. In this study, we examined the proteins binding to the 3′-region and characterized the sequences to which they bind to understand the combinatorial mechanisms through which CNTF induces VIP gene expression. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Mediatech (Herndon, VA); fetal bovine/horse serum was from Life Technologies, Inc.; and culture plates were from Costar (Corning, NY). Recombinant human CNTF was a gift from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (Tarrytown, NY). Oligonucleotides encoding the consensus sites for the transcription factors STAT, C/EBP, ETS, NFAT, AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, OCT-1, and nuclear factor-1 were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The remaining oligonucleotides were synthesized on a PE Applied Biosystems 394 synthesizer by the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in-house oligonucleotide facility. This included all PCR and mutagenic primers listed in Table I and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) probes G9 (GGG CAG GAT ATT CTT TTA CTG GAT CAG TCT GA), G10 (GGG CAT AGC AGG ATA TTC TTT TAC TGG), G11 (GGG TGG ATC AGT CTG ACT TTG AAC G), p28 (GGG TTT TAC TGG ATC AGT CTG ACT TTG AAC G), C/EBP (AGC TTG ATT AGG ACA TCG), acute phase response element (GGA CCA CAG TTG GGA TTT CCC AAC CTG ACC A), M6 (GGA CCA CAG TTG TGA TTT CAC AAC CTG ACC A), and CyB (GAA AAT ATG ATT AAG CAT AGA GCA GG).Table IPCR primers for site-directed mutagenesisPrimer5′ → 3′A1CCGGGTACCTAAAAAAGATTTCCTGGmA1CCGGGTACCTAAAAAAGAT G T A C T GGA4CACCTGCAGCGTTCAAAGTCAGACmG3CCG GGT ACC TAA AAA AGA T G T A C T GGT ATT AAG CCA CAG GAA CTC TGGa/s 1-aa/s, antisense. mG9CAG CTG CAG CGT TCA AAG TCA GAC TGA TC T TAG AAA AGA ATA TCC TGCa/s mS1CAG CTG CAG GTA TCA AAG TCA GAC TGA TCC AGT AAA Aa/s mS2CAG CTG CAG CGT AGT AAG TCA GAC TGA TCC AGT AAA Aa/s mS3CAG CTG CAG CGT TCA TTC TCA GAC TGA TCC AGT AAA Aa/s mS4CAG CTG CAG CGT TCA AAG ATT GAC TGA TCC AGT AAA Aa/s mS5CAG CTG CAG CGT TCA AAG TCA CTA TGA TCC AGT AAA Aa/s mS6CAG CTG CAG CGT TCA AAG TCA GAC ACT TCC AGT AAA Aa/s mS7CAG CTG CAG CGT TCA AAG TCA GAC TGA ATG AGT AAA Aa/s mS8CAG CTG CAG CGT TCA AAG TCA GAC TGA TCC TCA AAA Aa/s mS9CAG CTG CAG CGT TCA AAG TCA GAC TGA TCC AGT TTC Aa/s mS10CAG CTG CAG CGT TCA AAG TCA GAC TGA TCC AGT AAA TCG ATA T1-a a/s, antisense. Open table in a new tab NBFL cells were maintained and transfected as described previously (37Symes A.J. Rao M.S. Lewis S.E. Landis S.C. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 1.5 or 4.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and transfected overnight by calcium phosphate precipitation. Each well received 1 μg of luciferase reporter construct, 0.5 μg of RSV-β-galactosidase, and 2.5 μg of carrier DNA. CNTF was added in serum-free medium 6 h after the DNA precipitate was removed and for 40 h before cell harvesting. Samples were assayed for luciferase activity (41Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase activity (Galacto-Light Plus kit, Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to control for transfection efficiency. The details of Cy1luc, Cy1mG3luc, Cy1mG2luc (previously termed m2G2Cyluc), and VIP1330luc have been described (38Symes A.J. Lewis S.E. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Mol.

Biol. 1997; 7: 697-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The 3-bp substitution mutant VIPm1300luc was constructed using theCLONTECH Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit with the mutagenic primer 5′-GCA GGA TAT TCT TTT TGA GGA TCA GTC TGA C-3′ and the selection primer 5′-GAG CTC CCA TCG CGA TGG ATG CAT AG-3′. To construct a multimeric G9 site, the G9 EMSA probe was synthesized with 5′-GATC overhangs, phosphorylated, and ligated. The ligated fragments were digested with BamHI and BglII to digest fragments containing oligonucleotides ligated in the wrong orientation and then subcloned into BamHI-digested pSP73 plasmid (Promega). Fragments containing four copies of the G9 site in both the correct (4G9) and reverse (R4G9) orientations were excised byKpnI/PstI digest and inserted intoKpnI/PstI-digested ΔeRSVluc. Formation of 4(G9)luc and R4(G9)luc was confirmed by sequencing. All other luciferase plasmids were constructed by PCR site-directed mutagenesis (43Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) with primers containing either a 5′-KpnI or 3′-PstI digestion site (see Table I). Cy1mG9luc was prepared by PCR amplification of Cy1luc using primers A1 and mG9 (see Table I). A series of 3-bp substitution mutants were amplified from Cy1luc with primer A1 and one of primers mS1 to mS10 (see Table I). Cy1mG2luc was used as a template in PCR with mutant primers to construct the double mutants Cy1mG2mG3luc and Cy1mG2mG9luc (see Table I). Subsequently, Cy1mG2mG3luc was used as a template DNA to construct the triple mutant Cy1mG2mG3mG9luc (see Table I). In procedures where the template already contained an mG3 site, primer mA1 was used in place of primer A1 to maintain the mutation in G3. PCR products were gel-purified and ligated into KpnI/PstI-digested ΔeRSVluc. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm their identity. EMSAs were performed as described previously (38Symes A.J. Lewis S.E. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1750-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts were prepared from untreated NBFL cells and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with 0.5 ng of [α-32P]dCTP-labeled oligonucleotides. Binding reactions were electrophoresed on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 200 V. For the CNTF time course, NBFL cells were serum-starved overnight and then activated with CNTF for 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h prior to the extraction of nuclear proteins. When used, competitor oligonucleotides (5–200 ng) were incubated with the nuclear extracts for 10 min at room temperature prior to adding probe. We have previously characterized the STAT and AP-1 sites within the VIP CyRE and shown both sites to contribute to the CNTF-mediated induction of CyRE-dependent transcription (38Symes A.J. Lewis S.E. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1750-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Symes A.J. Gearan T. Eby J. Fink J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9648-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, our previous deletion studies on the VIP CyRE also revealed that a 28-bp region at the 3′-end of the CyRE, distinct from the STAT and AP-1 sites, contributes substantially to the transcriptional activity of the CyRE (38Symes A.J. Lewis S.E. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1750-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the exact sequences within the 3′-end of the VIP CyRE that mediate the actions of this 28-bp 3′-region, we compared murine and human genomic sequences (38Symes A.J. Lewis S.E. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1750-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the 180-bp CyRE is 84% homologous between mouse and human, the distal 28-bp 3′-sequence is only 53% conserved. However, one 4-bp motif (G9 site) is conserved between species, suggesting functional significance of this site. To investigate whether this 4-bp motif is important in mediating CNTF induction of CyRE transcription, we transfected NBFL neuroblastoma cells with a Cy1luc luciferase reporter plasmid mutated within these 4 bp (Cy1mG9luc) (TableI). CNTF induction of transcription driven by Cy1mG9luc was reduced to 28% of that mediated by Cy1luc (Fig. 1). These data suggest that this 4-bp motif may form part of a binding site for a protein complex that contributes to CNTF-induced transcription through the VIP CyRE. We wanted to investigate the relationship between the newly identified G9 site and the previously identified STAT and non-canonical AP-1 sites that contribute to CNTF-mediated induction of CyRE-driven transcription. To determine whether the 3′-G9 site acts independently of the STAT and AP-1 sites, we constructed a series of luciferase plasmids with individual, double, or triple substitution mutations at these sites within the wild-type Cy1luc plasmid. Cy1luc directed the highest level of transcription in unstimulated cells. CNTF induction of CyRE-mediated transcription was reduced in all of the mutant constructs. In the CyRE-luciferase construct with mutations in both STAT and AP-1 sites (Cy1mG2mG3luc), CNTF induced luciferase activity 9-fold (Fig. 2). This remaining CNTF inducibility mediated by a CyRE-luciferase plasmid without a functional AP-1 or STAT site supported the existence of additional functional sites such as the 3′-G9 site in the CyRE. CNTF induction of CyRE transcription was reduced to ∼17% of Cy1luc with single mutations in either the STAT or 3′-G9 site (Fig. 2). Mutations in both the STAT (G3) and 3′-G9 sites further reduced CNTF induction of transcription to 8% of that produced by the wild-type Cy1luc plasmid. Thus, the two sites each contribute to the CyRE-mediated CNTF response. Mutation of the AP-1 site (G2) reduced CNTF-induced transcription by 44%, and double mutants of the AP-1 site together with either the STAT or G9 site reduced CNTF induction of transcription by 90 and 84%, respectively. Introduction of mutations into all three sites (Cy1mG2mG3mG9luc) abrogated the response to CNTF. These data suggest that the STAT, AP-1, and 3′-G9 sites all independently contribute to CNTF induction of CyRE transcription. To investigate whether CNTF treatment of NBFL cells altered nuclear protein binding to the 3′-region of the CyRE, we performed EMSAs with four overlapping probes of the 3′-region of the CyRE (Fig.3 A). Three protein complexes of different mobility bound to different probes from the 3′-CyRE in nuclear extracts prepared from untreated NBFL cells (Fig.3 B). Complex A bound strongly to the G9 probe, complex B to the G10 probe, and complex C to the G11 probe (Fig. 3 B). CNTF treatment did not alter binding of any of these nuclear protein complexes, showing that these complexes are able to bind to the DNA sequences constitutively. We also investigated which complexes bound to a probe containing the entire distal 28 bp of the 3′-end (p28) and detected a single band with the same mobility as the G9-binding complex A, which did not change with CNTF treatment (Fig. 3 C and data not shown). The protein complex binding to p28 was competed by a 100-fold molar excess of G9, but not G10 or G11, suggesting that this complex was probably the G9-binding nuclear protein complex (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, nuclear protein binding to this region of DNA is complex; several protein complexes may be responsible for mediating the CNTF induction of CyRE-driven transcription at the 3′-end. To determine whether nuclear protein binding to the G9, G10, and G11 probes was specific and to identify whether similar proteins were bound to each of the probes, we performed EMSAs in the presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides. Binding of NBFL nuclear protein to each probe was specific, as its binding was competed by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig.4). The mG9 oligonucleotide failed to compete for binding to the G9 probe (Fig. 4 A) or to the p28 probe (Fig. 3 C), showing that this mutation markedly reduces the ability of complex A to bind. As this oligonucleotide is mutated in the same 4 bp as the Cy1mG9luc plasmid (Fig. 1), these data suggest that complex A binding to the G9 site may contribute to the CNTF induction of CyRE transcription. The G9 oligonucleotide competed for the protein complexes binding to the G10 and G11 probes; in contrast, G10 and G11 were unable to compete for the protein complexes binding to the G9 probe (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, complex A binding to the G9 probe appears to require sequence additional to that in either G10 or G11, despite the considerable overlap between the oligonucleotide probes. Our results implicate complex A binding to the G9 site as critical for the CNTF induction of CyRE-mediated transcription. In our initial attempts to identify the components of the G9-binding complex A, we used a variety of known transcription factor-binding sites to compete for binding of complex A to the G9 probe. None of the oligonucleotides shown or oligonucleotides containing CREB, SMAD, or NF-κB consensus sites competed for complex A binding (Fig. 4 D and data not shown). We also competed nuclear protein binding to the CyRE probes with an AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide, as there is an AP-1-like site within this region (ATCAGTCT). The AP-1 oligonucleotide failed to compete for binding of the nuclear protein complexes specific to the G9 or G10 probe. However, it did compete partially for complex C binding to the G11 probe (Fig. 4 C). Supershift analysis with antibodies raised against several different members of the AP-1 protein family (c-Fos, c-Jun, JunB, JunD, and activating transcription factor-2) did not identify any known AP-1 proteins contributing to complex C (data not shown). Thus, several unrelated protein complexes are able to bind to sites within the 3′-CyRE. Complex A may represent a novel constitutive factor required for CNTF-mediated transcription. To identify which specific bases within the G9 oligonucleotide are required for complex A binding, we synthesized oligonucleotides containing a series of sequential 2- and 3-bp mutations in the G9 probe. EMSAs performed with NBFL nuclear extracts binding to these mutant oligonucleotides showed that 2- or 3-bp mutations within a large 17-bp region reduced or eliminated complex A binding to the probe (Fig.5 A). This region includes and extends from the 4-bp mutation in mG9. The m3, m4, m5, and m6 oligonucleotides, with mutations in the sequence TTACTGGA, were unable to bind complex A or to compete for its binding to the wild-type G9 probe (Fig. 5 B). The m2 and m7 oligonucleotides bound complex A weakly and were able to compete for complex A binding to G9, but with less affinity than either the wild-type G9 or m1 oligonucleotide. Interestingly the m2, m3, m5, and m6 oligonucleotides all bound a larger complex, whereas m4 bound none. Reducing the length of the G9 oligonucleotide by 8 bp while retaining the central core recognition sequence also reduced binding of complex A. Thus, the binding site for complex A extends over 17 bp of the G9 oligonucleotide and requires adjacent sequence for high affinity binding. However, the core 8-bp sequence TTACTGGA is critical for complex A binding. To determine the exact sequence within the 3′-end of the CyRE necessary to mediate CNTF-induced transcription, we made a series of CyRE-luciferase constructs containing sequential 3-bp mutations along the most distal 28 bp of the 3′-CyRE, within the context of wild-type Cy1luc. A notable reduction in CNTF-mediated luciferase activity was observed in cells transfected with Cy1mS7luc, Cy1mS8luc, or Cy1mS9luc (Fig. 6 A). The 3-bp mutations in Cy1mS7luc and Cy1mS8luc each overlap the 4 bp mutated in Cy1mG9luc, confirming our original observation as to the importance of this site (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the 3-bp mutations in Cy1mS7luc, Cy1mS8luc, and Cy1mS9luc are located within the sequence TTTACTGGA required for complex A binding (Fig.5 A). A direct comparison of the transfection data with an EMSA using a G9 probe containing the same mutations as in Cy1mS7luc, Cy1mS8luc, and Cy1mS9luc (Fig. 6, A andB) demonstrated a correlation between loss of CNTF-induced transcriptional activity of th"

The binding of a C-type lectin-like domain to a ligand is often influenced by calcium. Recently, we have identified a site in the C-type lectin-like domain of tetranectin, involving Lys-148, Glu-150, and Asp-165, which mediates calcium-sensitive binding to plasminogen kringle 4. Here, we investigate the effect of conservative substitutions of these and a neighboring amino acid residue. Substitution of Thr-149 in tetranectin with a tyrosine residue considerably increases the affinity for plasminogen kringle 4, and, in addition, confers affinity for plasminogen kringle 2. As shown by isothermal titration calorimetry analysis, this new interaction is stronger than the binding of wild-type tetranectin to plasminogen kringle 4.

Furthermore, TN and Plg are colocalized at the invasive front of cutaneous melanoma lesions (5De Vries T.J. De Wit P.E. Clemmensen I. Verspaget H.W. Weidle U.H. Bröcker E.B. Ruiter D.J.

The plasma TN level is reduced in cancer patients (9Jensen B.A. Clemmensen I. Cancer. 1988; 62: 869-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and TN has been shown to be a useful prognostic marker in the diagnosis of certain types of cancer (10Høgdall C.K. APMIS Suppl. 1998; 86: 1-31PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of TN (amino acid residues 53–181) exhibits sequence and structural similarity with the C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs), including the two conserved binding sites for calcium ions (11Fuhlendorff J. Clemmensen I. Magnusson S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6757-6764Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Kastrup J.S. Nielsen B.B. Rasmussen H. Holtet T.L. Graversen J.H. Etzerodt M. Thøgersen H.C. Larsen I.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Trimerization of TN is mediated by a coiled-coil element, spanning at least amino acid residues 26 to 52 and adjoined to the N terminus of the CTLD domain (13Nielsen B.B. Kastrup J.S. Rasmussen H. Holtet T.L. Graversen J.H. Etzerodt M. Thøgersen H.C. Larsen I.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). TN binds complex sulfated carbohydrates (14Clemmensen I. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1989; 49: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These interactions are not mediated by the CTLD, but by lysine residues located in the N-terminal part of TN, comprising residues 1–25 (15Lorentsen R.H. Graversen J.H. Caterer N.R. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 83-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plg, the zymogen of plasmin, which is the main protease involved in fibrinolysis, consists of seven domains, an N-terminal peptide, five kringle domains, and a serine protease domain with trypsin-like specificity (16Sottrup-Jensen L. Claeys H. Zajdel M. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. Davidson J.F. Rowanm R.M. Samama M.M. Desnoyes P.C. Progress in Chemical Fibrinolysis and Thrombolysis. Raven Press, New York1978: 191-209Google Scholar). Plg and plasmin are involved in several additional physiological and pathological processes requiring highly regulated proteolytic activity, such as tissue remodeling, ovulation, inflammation, and invasive growth of metastases (17Ponting C.P. Marshall J.M. Cederholm-Williams S.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 3: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Angiostatin, a fragment of Plg comprising kringles 1 to 4, has been shown both in vivo and in vitro to be an endothelial cell-specific inhibitor of angiogenesis (18O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Cao Y. Moses M. Lane W.S. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A fragment of angiostatin containing kringles 1 to 3 has been shown to be more potent than full-length angiostatin in inhibition of basic fibroblast growth factor-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation both in vivo and in vitro. Isolated kringle 1, 2, or 3 also exhibited an effect, whereas kringle 4 showed no effect (19MacDonald N.J. Murad A.C. Fogler W.E. Lu Y. Sim B.K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 264: 469-477Google Scholar, 20Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Söhndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinás M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29461-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In contrast, kringle 4 was almost as potent an inhibitor of endothelial cell migration as angiostatin, whereas kringle 1 and a fragment containing kringle 1 to 3 showed a substantially lower activity. Kringle 2 and kringle 3 and a fragment containing both kringle 2 and 3 had intermediate effects on cell migration (21Ji W. Castellino F.J. Chang Y. Deford M.E. Gray H. Villarreal X. Kondri M.E. Marti D.N. Llinás M. Schaller J. Kramer R.A. Trail P.A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1731-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Also, kringle 5 of Plg has been shown to exert an inhibitory effect on neovascularization (22Cao Y. Chen A. An S.S.A. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Llinas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22924-22928Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the biological properties of angiostatin action remains unresolved. Kringle domains consist of approximately 80 amino acid residues and three conserved intradomain disulfide bridges. Many kringle domains bind small dipolar molecules through the so-called lysine-binding pocket, a surface-exposed hydrophobic cleft with positively and negatively charged amino acid residues located at each end. Many kringle domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, and several of these interactions are sensitive to lysine analogues. TN binds to Plg K4, and binding is sensitive to both lysine and calcium (2Clemmensen I. Petersen L.C. Kluft C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 23Graversen J.H. Lorentsen R.H. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29241-29246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). TN binding involves at least one amino acid residue, Arg-32, outside the lysine-binding pocket of Plg K4 (24Graversen J.H. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7414-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The binding of TN to Plg K4 is mediated by the CTLD of TN, and each TN trimer has three binding sites, one on each protomer (23Graversen J.H. Lorentsen R.H. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29241-29246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have identified the residues Lys-148, Glu-150, and Asp-165 to be of primary importance for this interaction (23Graversen J.H. Lorentsen R.H. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29241-29246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All three residues are located in the loop region of TN, which also mediates calcium binding. The residues Glu-150 and Asp-165 are directly involved in coordinating calcium (12Kastrup J.S. Nielsen B.B. Rasmussen H. Holtet T.L. Graversen J.H. Etzerodt M. Thøgersen H.C. Larsen I.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is possible to modulate the calcium sensitivity of the Plg K4-TN interaction by substituting calcium coordinating amino acid residues of TN, not directly involved in binding Plg K4 (23Graversen J.H. Lorentsen R.H. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29241-29246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). CTLDs, with essentially identical folds, are involved in binding a wide diversity of ligands mediated by this loop region (25Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In addition to carbohydrates, binding has been shown to lipids (26Sano H. Kuroki Y. Honma T. Ogasawara Y. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Akino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4783-4789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), ice (27Ewart K.V. Li Z. Yang D.S.C. Fletcher G.L. Hew C.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4080-4085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and proteins. Besides TN, examples of CTLDs involved in protein binding are natural killer cell receptor Ly49 A (28Natarajan K.

Helm B. Marsh P. Padlan E. Geha R.S. Gould H. Nature. 1989; 338: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The structure of a fragment of natural killer cell receptor Ly49 A in complex with the major histocompatibility complex class 1 molecule H-2Ddhas recently been reported (32Tormo J. Natarajan K. Margulies D.H. Mariuzza R.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Two hydrophilic binding sites for the ligand were identified in the Ly49 A CTLD loop region. In this study we report on the effect of conservative mutations in the Plg K4 binding site of TN. No hydrophobic or aromatic amino acid side chain of rTN, which would be assumed to interact with the hydrophobic cleft of the lysine-binding pocket of rPlg K4, has been identified as being of major importance for binding of rTN to rPlg K4. We therefore elected to study the effect of substituting the TN residue Thr-149, located between the binding site residues Lys-148 and Glu-150, with Phe or Tyr. Notably, the rTN T149Y derivative, found to bind rPlg K4 with substantial increased affinity, also exhibited a novel affinity for Plg K2. Polymerase chain reactions were conducted on cDNA encoding human plasminogen (a gift from Dr. T. E. Petersen, University of Aarhus). Polymerase chain reaction products were cleaved using BamHI and HindIII and subcloned into the vector pT7H6UB (33Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M. Gliemann J. Thøgersen H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To construct the plasmid encoding Plg kringle 1, the following primers were used, 5′-CGT CCT GGA TCC ATC GAG GGT AGG TCA GAG TGC AAG ACT GGG AAT GG-3′ and 5′-CGA CCG AAG CTT ATT CAC ACT CAA GAA TGT CGC-3′. The expression vector encodes a fusion protein containing a hexa-His sequence, human ubiquitin, an FXacleavage site followed by human Plg kringle 1, corresponding to amino acid residues Ser-82 to Glu-163 of human Plg. To construct the plasmid encoding Plg kringle 2 C169S, the following primers were used, 5′-GGT GGA TCC ATC GAG GGT AGG GGC GAG GAA TGT ATG CAT TCC AGT GGA GAA AAC-3′ and 5′-TTC AAG CTT GCA TGC TTA TGT TGT GCA GCG GGG GAT GTC-3′. The expression vector encodes a fusion protein containing a hexa-His sequence, human ubiquitin, an FXa cleavage site followed by a Gly and then human Plg kringle 2 corresponding to amino acid residues Glu-164 to Thr-245 of human Plg with the mutation C169S. To construct the plasmid encoding Plg kringle 3, the following primers were used, 5′-GGT GGA TCC ATC GAG GGT AGG ACC TAC CAG TGT CTG AGG GGA AC-3′ and 5′-TTC AAG CTT GCA TGC TTA GGA GTC ACA GGA CGG TAT CTT AC-3′. The expression vector encodes a fusion protein containing a hexa-His sequence, human ubiquitin, an FXa cleavage site followed by human Plg kringle 3 corresponding to amino acid residues Thr-253 to Ser-335 of human Plg. The mutation C299S was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (24Graversen J.H. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7414-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To construct the plasmid encoding Plg kringle 2–3, the following primers were used, 5′-GGT GGA TCC ATC GAG GGT AG GGC GAG GAA TGT ATG CAT TGC AGT-3′ and 5′-TTC AAG CTT GCA TGC TTA GGA GTC ACA GGA CGG TAT CTT AC-3′. The expression vector encodes a fusion protein containing a hexa-His sequence, human ubiquitin, an FXa cleavage site followed by a Gly and then human Plg kringle 2–3 corresponding to amino acid residues Glu-164 to Ser-335 of human Plg. The rPlg K4 and the rTN expression vector have previously been described (1Holtet T.L. Graversen J.H. Clemmensen I. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7414-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Single residue mutation in the rTN expression vector was carried out as described previously (23Graversen J.H. Lorentsen R.H. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29241-29246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Expression and in vitro refolding of plasminogen derivatives were performed as described for rPlg K4 (24Graversen J.H. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7414-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). rPlg K1 was purified as described for rPlg K4 (24Graversen J.H. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7414-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). rPlg K2 C169S was purified as rPlg K4, with the modification that the buffers used for affinity chromatography on lysine-Sepharose contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The derivatives H6Ubi-Plg K3 C299S and H6Ubi-Plg K2–3 were not subjected to FXacleavage, to avoid problems caused by a previously described internal cleavage site for FXa in Plg kringle 3 (34Söhndel S. Hu C.K. Marti D. Affolter M. Schaller J. Llinás M. Rickli E.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2357-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). H6Ubi-Plg K3 C299S and H6Ubi-Plg K2–3 were purified by ion-exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 25 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.0, buffer gradient ranging from 10 to 500 mm NaCl. Expression and purification of rTN derivatives were performed as described previously for rTN (15Lorentsen R.H. Graversen J.H. Caterer N.R. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 83-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plg was purified from pooled outdated blood bank plasma and fragmented by digestion with elastase (35Lerch P.G. Rickli E.E. Lergier W. Gillessen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Affinity chromatography on lysine-Sepharose yielded mini-Plg in the flow-trough, while fragments corresponding to kringle 4, kringle 1–3, and Lys- and Glu-Plg were eluted with 6-aminohexanoic acid (6-AHA). Mini-Plg was further purified on SP-Sepharose in 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, buffer gradient ranging from 10 to 1000 mm NaCl. Plg kringle 1–3 was purified from the mixture of fragments eluted from the lysine-Sepharose with 6-AHA by ion-exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose in 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, buffer using a gradient ranging from 10 to 1000 mm NaCl. Purified mini-Plg and kringle 1–3 were identified by N-terminal sequencing. Titrations were performed on an MCS ITC instrument from MicroCal Inc. (Northampton, MA) at 25 °C (36Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar). Titrations were performed with 21 injections of 13.011 μl of titrator into a cell with a volume of 1.3187 ml while stirring at 400 rpm. Protein samples were in a 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer, and all samples were degassed by stirring under vacuum prior to use. The concentrations of proteins used in the titrations of the protein-protein interactions were 0.00827 mm of rTN T149Y trimers in the chamber and 0.341 mm and 0.398 mm of rPlg K2 C169S and rPlg K4, respectively, in the syringe. After subtraction of a blank titration of titrator into the buffer, all binding isotherms were fitted using the Origin version 4.1 software package (MicroCal Inc.). The one-site model, which assumes independent and identical binding sites, was used. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding analysis was performed on a BIAcore 2000 instrument (BIAcore, Sweden). Proteins to be immobilized were dissolved in the following buffers, and the following amounts of protein were immobilized on a CM5 BIAcore sensorchip using the Amine Coupling kit (BIAcore, Sweden): rPlg K4, buffer 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, immobilized 0.0337 pmol/mm2; Plg, buffer 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, immobilized 0.0537 pmol/mm2; rPlg K2 C169S, buffer 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 4.5, immobilized 0.0358 pmol/mm2; H6Ubi-Plg K2–3, buffer 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 4.5, immobilized 0.064 pmol/mm2; H6Ubi-Plg K3 C299S, buffer 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 4.5, immobilized 0.157 pmol/mm2; kringle 1–3, buffer 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, immobilized 0.039 pmol/mm2; mini-Plg, buffer 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, immobilized 0.037 pmol/mm2. Chips were capped using 1 methanolamine (pH 8.5). All binding experiments and data analysis were performed as described previously (23Graversen J.H. Lorentsen R.H. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29241-29246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Similar expression level and essentially similar refolding efficiency as for wild-type rTN were observed for each single and double residue mutants of rTN. All kringle derivatives produced approximately the same expression levels as rPlg kringle 4, and all refolded in similar yields. With the exception of Plg kringle 1–3, all protein preparations, both of rTN and recombinant and non-recombinant kringle fragments, appeared essentially homogeneous as judged from non-reducing SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1), thereby indicating that the purified recombinant derivatives represented protein samples with unique disulfide bridge patterns. The Plg kringle 1–3 pool exhibited a composite band with the main fraction having Arg-68 as the N-terminal residue. On the basis of affinity for lysine analogues or rTN derivatives, or ability to refold into a product of unique disulfide topology (H6Ubi-Plg K3 C299S), all purified recombinant kringle derivatives were considered successfully refolded. TheA(1%)280 value for rPlg K2 C169S was determined by amino acid analysis to be 35 gl−1 cm−1. Based on SDS-PAGE staining intensities, theA(1%)280 value of 20 gl−1cm−1 determined for rTN was found justified for use with all rTN derivatives. All rTN derivatives exhibited the hypochromic effect, indicating correct refolding of the hydrophobic core (23Graversen J.H. Lorentsen R.H. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29241-29246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), further substantiating that correct refolding had indeed been achieved. Because rTN, and all the derivatives of it used in this study, are trimeric proteins with three binding sites for Plg K4 in each trimer, a simple kinetic analysis of the SPR data cannot be applied. As discussed previously (23Graversen J.H. Lorentsen R.H. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29241-29246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we assume a Langmuir relationship between the TN concentrations used, [L], in a given SPR experiment and the plateau responses, R pl, as described by the following equation: Rpl=Rmax[L][L]+KD,spr′Equation 1 where R max represents the maximal binding capacity of the chip and KD,spr′is the apparent dissociation constant. The dissociation constant determined by this method in the previous study for the interaction between rPlg K4 and rTN was two orders of magnitudes smaller than the corresponding dissociation constant in solution, as determined by ITC binding analysis (23Graversen J.H. Lorentsen R.H. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29241-29246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The explanation for this difference is probably the high local concentration of binding sites close to the chip surface when one trimer is bound. Consequently, we restricted the analysis to a relative comparison of plateau responses under identical experimental conditions for the different rTN derivatives (i.e. same protein concentration, same buffer and flow conditions, and using the same flow-cell). Representative sensorgrams from the SPR analysis, using an rTN trimer derivative concentration of 0.5 μm and the same buffer and flow conditions, and using the same flow-cell, are shown in Fig.2. A histogram showing the plateau response of all the rTN derivatives used is shown in Fig.3. Substitutions of TN Lys-148 with either Ala, Met, or Arg and substitutions of TN Asp-165 with either Ala, Glu, or Asn all eliminated the binding of rTN to Plg and rPlg K4. Loss of Plg and rPlg K4 binding was also found after substitution of TN Glu-150 with Ala or Gln. None of these derivatives bound rPlg K4-Sepharose (result not shown). The conservative substitution of TN Glu-150 with Asp decreased the response to rPlg K4 (R pl 424 ± 88 versus rTN 617 ± 8) and the derivative bound to rPlg K4-Sepharose (not shown). Substituting Thr-149 of rTN with Met or Arg decreased the response to rPlg K4 (R pl 456 ± 76 and 596 ± 77, respectively) and Plg (R pl130 ± 15 and 243 ± 13, respectively, versus rTN 374 ± 2) as judged from SPR analysis, and both derivatives bound to rPlg K4-Sepharose (not shown). Remarkably, substituting TN Thr-149 with Phe or Tyr led to an increase in the response of these TN derivatives toward rPlg K4 (R pl 765 ± 76 and 767 ± 45, respectively) and in particular toward Plg (R pl 821 ± 64 and 1464 ± 20, respectively), with rTN T149Y exhibiting the larger increase in response (Fig. 2).Figure 3Plateau response of the binding of rTN derivatives to Plg and rPlg K4.

Also, the maximal binding capacity (R max) of the rPlg K4 chip remained constant, whereas it increased substantially for the Plg chip, indicating that each Plg molecule may bind an additional rTN T149Y trimer at a binding site different from K4. To examine whether the higher response in binding the TN derivative rTN T149Y to Plg was due to binding to additional sites in Plg, we immobilized Plg kringle 1–3 and mini-Plg on a sensorchip. As can be seen from Fig.4, rTN T149Y bound to Plg kringle 1–3, whereas rTN did not. None of the proteins bound to mini-Plg. We then constructed four expression plasmids encoding each of the Plg kringles 1, 2, and 3 and the two-domain kringle 2 + 3, respectively. Cys-169 and Cys-299, which in Plg forms an inter-domain disulfide bridge between kringles 2 and 3, were substituted by Ser in the rPlg K2 and rPlg K3 constructs, respectively, to prevent refolding problems and aggregation, an approach that has also been applied earlier (37Marti D. Schaller J. Ochensberger B. Rickli E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The four kringle derivatives were then expressed, refolded, and immobilized on sensorchips, and binding analysis of rTN and rTN T149Y was performed. rTN T149Y bound to rPlg K2 C169S and H6Ubi-Plg K2–3, whereas rTN did not. None of the proteins bound to H6Ubi-Plg K3 C299S. Both rTN and rTN T149Y exhibited very low affinities toward rPlg K1. Binding of the other rTN derivatives toward rPlg K2 C169S was also tested, and rTN T149F was found to exhibit a low response toward rPlg K2 C169S (R pl rTN T149F 65 ± 4 and rTN T149Y 571 ± 15), whereas rTN, rTN T149M, and rTN T149R did not bind rPlg K2 C169S (R pl −15 ± 17,R pl −26 ± 11, and −18 ± 14, respectively). Fig. 2 (top) shows representative sensorgrams for the interaction of rPlg K2 C169S with some rTN derivatives, the rTN derivatives for which no sensorgrams are shown did not bind rPlg K2 C169S. The effect of introducing additional substitutions in the rTN T149Y derivative of residues found to be of primary importance for the binding of rTN to Plg, i.e. TN K148R, TN E150Q, and TN D165N, was a decrease in the response toward Plg and rPlg K4 as well as toward rPlg K2 C169S. rTN [K148R,T149Y] did not bind to Plg, to rPlg K4, nor to rPlg K2 C169S. rTN [T149Y,D165N] and rTN [T149Y, E150Q] did not bind to rPlg K4 but bound, albeit weakly, to Plg and rPlg K2 C169S, as judged from the SPR data. Neither rTN [K148R,T149Y], rTN [T149Y,D165N], nor rTN [T149Y, E150Q] bound to rPlg K4-Sepharose (result not shown). rTN T149Y was the only derivative able to bind rPlg K2-Sepharose (result not shown). The Ca2+ sensitivities of the interactions of rTN T149F and rTN T149Y with Plg were comparable to the sensitivity found for the interaction of rTN with Plg (Fig.5). The binding of rTN T149F and rTN T149Y to rPlg K2 C169S and rPlg K4 was also tested and found sensitive to calcium. Calcium concentration at half-maximal binding of rTN T149F to rPlg K2 C169S was approximately 400 μm and to rPlg K4 approximately 750 μm. The calcium concentrations at half-maximal binding of rTN T149Y to Plg K2 C169S and rPlg K4 were both approximately 1000 μm. The calcium concentration at half-maximal binding of rTN to rPlg K4 was approximately 250 μm (23Graversen J.H. Lorentsen R.H. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29241-29246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 6-AHA sensitivities of the interactions of rTN, rTN T149F, and rTN T149Y with Plg and rPlg K4 were also analyzed, as was the sensitivity of binding rTN T149F and rTN T149Y to rPlg K2 C169S (Fig.6). The interaction of rTN T149Y with rPlg K4 was more sensitive to 6-AHA than was the interaction with rPlg K2 C169S (6-AHA concentration at half-maximal binding of approximately 100 μm versus approximately 2000 μm), in accord with the lower affinity of 6-AHA for Plg K2 than for Plg K4 (37Marti D. Schaller J. Ochensberger B. Rickli E.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The sensitivity to 6-AHA of the interaction between rTN T149Y and Plg was intermediate between the sensitivity of the interactions with the individual kringle derivatives rPlg K2 C169S and rPlg K4 (6-AHA concentration at half-maximal binding of approximately 1000 μm), reflecting that rTN T149Y bound to both kringles in Plg. The sensitivity to 6-AHA for the interaction of rTN T149Y with rPlg K4 was slightly lower than that found for rTN, in accord with the increased affinity of rTN T149Y for rPlg K4. The binding of rTN T149Y to rPlg K4 and rPlg K2 C169S were analyzed further using ITC binding analysis. The binding parameters determined are shown in Table II, and Fig. 7 shows representative thermograms and binding isotherms obtained from the titrations. All interactions were found to be strongly enthalpy-driven. Substituting TN Thr-149 with Tyr was found to make the enthalpy of the interaction with rPlg K4 less favorable, but also to increase the entropy of the interaction, yielding a factor of 12.5 in net increase in apparent affinity. The stoichiometries of the interaction of rTN T149Y with rPlg K2 C169S and rPlg K4 both corresponded to the presence of three kringle binding sites in each rTN T149Y trimer. The dissociation constant for the binding of rTN T149Y to rPlg K2 C169S, determined using ITC, was found to be smaller than for the binding of rTN to rPlg K4. For this interaction we also observed a divergence between the apparent binding constants determined by ITC and by SPR analysis for the binding of rTN T149Y to rPlg K2 C169S, similar to that observed for binding rTN and rTN T149Y to rPlg K4.Table IIBinding parameters obtained from the ITC analysisrPlg K4rPlg K2 C169SrTN 2-aData taken from (23).rTN T149YrTN T149YStoichiometry3.2 ± 0.13.21 ± 0.033.12 ± 0.06K D′(μm)52.9 ± 3.14.22 ± 0.7713.3 ± 0.53ΔG ° (kJ/mol)−24.4 ± 0.1−30.7 ± 0.4−27.8 ± 0.1−TΔS ° (kJ/mol)89 ± 449.6 ± 0.951.6 ± 1.8ΔH (kJ/mol)−113 ± 4−80.3 ± 0.8−79.4 ± 1.8The stoichiometry refers to the estimated number of kringle binding sites on rTN trimers2-a Data taken from (23Graversen J.H.

Open table in a new tab The stoichiometry refers to the estimated number of kringle binding sites on rTN trimers Conservative substitutions of the three TN amino acid residues previously identified to be of importance for the binding of TN to Plg, namely Lys-148, Glu-150, and Asp-165 (23Graversen J.H.

A summary of the binding analysis of rTN derivatives to Plg, rPlg K2 C169S, and rPlg K4 is shown in Table III. Only the substitution of Glu-150 with Asp retained a minimal level of binding, whereas substitution of Lys-148 with Arg, Glu-150 with Gln, and Asp-165 with Glu or Asn all abolished binding.Table IIISummary of the SPR binding analysis of the rTN derivatives to Plg, rPlg K2 C169S, and rPlg K4rTN and derivativesPlgrPlg K2 C169SrPlg K4rTN++ 3-a−, no binding; +, weaker binding than the standard; ++, standard binding strength; +++, stronger binding than the standard.−++K148A−−−K148M−−−K148R−−−T149F+++++++T149M+−+T149R+−++T149Y++++++++E150A−−−E150D+−+E150Q−−−D165A−−−D165E−−−D165N−−−T149Y, K148R−−−T149Y, E150Q++−T149Y, D165N++−rTN is the standard with respect to binding to Plg and rPlg K4, whereas rTN T149Y is the standard with respect to binding to rPlg K2 C169S.3-a −, no binding; +, weaker binding than the standard; ++, standard binding strength; +++, stronger binding than the standard. Open table in a new tab rTN is the standard with respect to binding to Plg and rPlg K4, whereas rTN T149Y is the standard with respect to binding to rPlg K2 C169S. Remarkably, rTN T149Y binds with a higher affinity to rPlg K4 than does rTN. As determined by ITC, the dissociation constant in solution is 12.5 times smaller. SPR analysis also showed a change in binding affinity, although exact differences were not interpretable due to the trimeric nature of TN. This implies that the SPR analysis of this system should only be applied for comparative analysis.R max values determined for binding of rTN and rTN T149Y to rPlg K4 are practically identical, indicating that rTN T149Y, like rTN, only binds to one site in rPlg K4. rTN T149Y was found to bind two sites in Plg, and, by studying a collection of Plg fragments, we showed that the additional site is located in kringle 2. We determined the dissociation constant of this interaction using ITC analysis and found that binding of rTN T149Y to rPlg K2 C169S is stronger than the binding of rTN to rPlg K4. The interaction between rTN T149Y and Plg is sensitive to calcium, and substituting Lys-148, Glu-150, or Asp-165 in rTN T149Y all decreased the affinity, showing that the region of TN previously identified as binding to Plg (23Graversen J.H. Lorentsen R.H. Jacobsen C. Moestrup S.K. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29241-29246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) is involved. The interactions of rTN T149Y with Plg, rPlg K4, and rPlg K2 C169S are sensitive to 6-AHA, strongly indicating that rTN T149Y binds to the lysine binding pocket of both rPlg K4 and rPlg K2 C169S. The calcium sensitivities for the interactions of rTN T149F and rTN T149Y with Plg are similar to that found for the rTN-Plg interaction, showing that the binding sites in the TN derivatives are identical, and that the T149Y substitution does not affect calcium binding significantly. The interactions of rTN and rTN E150D with rPlg K4 exhibited similar calcium sensitivities, showing that Asp can substitute for Glu with respect to calcium binding, and only affects Plg binding. Structurally, kringle 2 and 4 of Plg are similar, with some differences in their lysine-binding pocket. Contrary to K4, K2 binds 5-aminopentanoic acid stronger than 6-AHA (38Marti D.N. Hu C.K. An S.S.A. von Haller P. Schaller J. Llinas M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11591-11604Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 39Wu T.P. Padmanabhan K. Tulinsky A. Mulichak A.M.

The sequence homology between kringle 2 and kringle 4 of Plg is relatively low, and Plg K4 shows higher sequence homology with many kringles from other proteins than with Plg K2. However, the hydrophobic cleft of the lysine binding pocket in Plg K2 is conserved relative to K4. The hydrophobic cleft is constituted by the aromatic amino acid residues Trp-62, Phe-64, and Trp-72 (40Marti D.N. Schaller J. Llinás M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15741-15755Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We propose that the Tyr residue in rTN T149Y interacts with the hydrophobic cleft. This interaction between aromatic residues could account for the increased entropy of interaction. Two amino acid residues are not conserved between the TN binding site previously described for Plg K4 (24Graversen J.H. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7414-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and Plg K2, namely, the residues corresponding to Arg-32 and Asp-57 in Plg K4, which in Plg K2 are Ala and Glu, respectively. The mutation R32A in rPlg K4 disrupts TN binding (24Graversen J.H. Sigurskjold B.W. Thøgersen H.C. Etzerodt M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7414-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), indicating that the contribution to the binding strength from Tyr at position 149 is sufficient to overcome this substitution. CTLDs bind to a wide range of ligands, and these interactions often involve the loop region of the CTLD, which is placed on a conserved structural scaffold (25Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In several studies it has been possible to engineer a new carbohydrate affinity into a CTLD, including a change in carbohydrate specificity (25Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). We have not yet been able to construct an rTN derivative that binds strongly and exclusively to Plg K2, although we have noted that rTN T149Y,E150Q and rTN T149Y,D165N, as observed by SPR analysis, exhibit low affinities for rPlg K2 C169S and no affinity to rPlg K4.
