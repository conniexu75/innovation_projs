https://openalex.org/W1934094702,"An international consortium of colorectal cancer researchers undertakes a large-scale data sharing project to achieve a consensus molecular classification of colorectal cancers. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a frequently lethal disease with heterogeneous outcomes and drug responses. To resolve inconsistencies among the reported gene expression–based CRC classifications and facilitate clinical translation, we formed an international consortium dedicated to large-scale data sharing and analytics across expert groups. We show marked interconnectivity between six independent classification systems coalescing into four consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) with distinguishing features: CMS1 (microsatellite instability immune, 14%), hypermutated, microsatellite unstable and strong immune activation; CMS2 (canonical, 37%), epithelial, marked WNT and MYC signaling activation; CMS3 (metabolic, 13%), epithelial and evident metabolic dysregulation; and CMS4 (mesenchymal, 23%), prominent transforming growth factor–β activation, stromal invasion and angiogenesis. Samples with mixed features (13%) possibly represent a transition phenotype or intratumoral heterogeneity. We consider the CMS groups the most robust classification system currently available for CRC—with clear biological interpretability—and the basis for future clinical stratification and subtype-based targeted interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2111902267,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies typically collapse data from many subjects, but brain functional organization varies between individuals. Here we establish that this individual variability is both robust and reliable, using data from the Human Connectome Project to demonstrate that functional connectivity profiles act as a 'fingerprint' that can accurately identify subjects from a large group. Identification was successful across scan sessions and even between task and rest conditions, indicating that an individual's connectivity profile is intrinsic, and can be used to distinguish that individual regardless of how the brain is engaged during imaging. Characteristic connectivity patterns were distributed throughout the brain, but the frontoparietal network emerged as most distinctive. Furthermore, we show that connectivity profiles predict levels of fluid intelligence: the same networks that were most discriminating of individuals were also most predictive of cognitive behavior. Results indicate the potential to draw inferences about single subjects on the basis of functional connectivity fMRI."

The inevitable process of aging affects all tissues of the body and determines the quality and length of life. Human aging is by far the most critical risk factor for the development of several diseases that appear to exclusively affect the elderly, due to mostly unknown reasons (Cummings, 2008Cummings J.

While aggressive familial early onset versions of fatal neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease can emerge in mid-life, the overwhelming majority of cases develop sporadically in old age, without known genetic causes. Neurons are a prime target for cellular aging. Unlike most other cell types, neurons are mainly born during embryogenesis and then face a demand for life-long performance. Progressive aging also leads to declines in neuronal plasticity and cognitive performances in the majority of healthy people, suggesting that neurons in the brain might decay over their lifetime (Burke and Barnes, 2006Burke S.N.

The aging brain.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2008; 3: 41-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transcriptional profiling of different tissues has revealed similar age-related changes across different tissues, including genes involved in stress response, inflammation, and Ca2+ homeostasis, whereas tissue-specific changes of the aging human cortex were detected in genes controlling synaptic functions (Adler et al., 2007Adler A.S.

To experimentally assess how progressive human age can cause persistent cellular alterations that eventually emerge as decreased functionality, vital human cells, particularly neurons from donors of a broad range of ages, would be highly desirable. However, due to the inaccessibility of live human brain tissue, most studies have been limited to animal models that, while yielding important insights, have also revealed limitations regarding transferability to human physiology and lifespan. Human patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based disease models have provided fascinating insights into disease-relevant mechanisms and pre-clinical drug evaluation directly in functional human neurons (Israel et al., 2012Israel M.A. Yuan S.H.

However, preservation of human age as a major pathogenic risk factor would seem unlikely, given that cells must transit the embryo-like iPSC state, which likely rejuvenates old somatic cells back into an embryonic state (Lapasset et al., 2011Lapasset L.

Furthermore, the numerous cell divisions required for the reprogramming process and differentiation may dilute any accumulated macromolecular damage. The direct transcription factor-based conversion of fibroblasts into induced neurons (iNs) represents an alternative avenue for generating human neurons in vitro (Pang et al., 2011Pang Z.P. Yang N. Vierbuchen T. Ostermeier A. Fuentes D.R. Yang T.Q. Citri A. Sebastiano V. Marro S. Südhof T.C. Wernig M.

Kokubu Y. Südhof T.C. Wernig M. Direct conversion of fibroblasts to functional neurons by defined factors.Nature. 2010; 463: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). Induction of only two transcription factors in combination with a cocktail of small molecular enhancers was shown to directly yield functional iNs from human fibroblasts with high efficiencies (Ladewig et al., 2012Ladewig J. Mertens J. Kesavan J. Doerr J. Poppe D. Glaue F. Herms S. Wernet P. Kögler G. Müller F.J. et al.Small molecules enable highly efficient neuronal conversion of human fibroblasts.Nat.

Small molecules enable neurogenin 2 to efficiently convert human fibroblasts into cholinergic neurons.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). As iNs circumvent the pluripotent state as well as any cell division, we hypothesize that direct conversion preserves the cellular signatures of aging and results in neurons that show age equivalence with their human donor. In this study, we set out to analyze primary cells from young and old human donors to identify the key factors relevant to human aging and to subsequently program these cells into iNs to generate an age-equivalent in vitro model for neuronal cell aging. Increasing evidence suggests that iPSC reprogramming of somatic cells into the embryo-like state largely resets their epigenetic state and either permanently deletes or temporarily conceals any memory of their age of origin. To test this paradigm in the context of human aging, we obtained skin fibroblasts from 19 individuals ranging in age from 0 to 89 years (Table S1) and reprogrammed 16 lines into iPSCs by overexpression of the four Yamanaka factors (Figure 1A) (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors.Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15051) Google Scholar). Clonally derived iPSCs showed typical morphologies of human pluripotent cells and nuclear expression of Nanog (Figure 1B); they were analyzed by G-banding to be karyotypically normal (Figure 1C). All iPSC lines possessed an expression profile typical of pluripotent stem cells, with Lin28A/B, MycN, Nanog, Tert, Oct4, Nodal, Dppa2/4, and Otx2 all being more than 1,000× upregulated as compared to fibroblasts (Figure 1D; Table S2). To investigate the extent to which iPSCs can retain the aging signatures of their donors, we performed high-throughput whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and compared the gene expression patterns of old and young fibroblasts and of derived iPSCs. The expression profiles of fibroblasts and iPSC samples were clearly distinguishable and clustered by overall expression similarity (Figure 1E). The independent clonal iPSC lines from the same donor typically, but not always, clustered together (Figure 1E). To identify putative aging genes, we performed differential expression analysis between cells derived from donors <40 years and cells from donors >40 years of age and found that, in fibroblasts, 78 genes were significantly differentially expressed, with a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p value (padj) of <0.05 (Figure 1F; Table S3) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing.J. R. Stat. Soc., B. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). In contrast, iPSCs showed fewer overall expression variations and only one gene was determined to be significantly differentially expressed (Figure 1G). When only retrovirus-based iPSCs were compared, no genes were found to be significantly differentially expressed (data not shown). These data thus confirm that the age-dependent gene expression signatures present in primary fibroblasts become largely erased during reprogramming into iPSCs. To generate neurons directly from fibroblasts, we optimized an Ascl1/Ngn2 (AN)-based and small molecule-enhanced iN protocol (Figure 2A) (Ladewig et al., 2012Ladewig J. Mertens J. Kesavan J. Doerr J. Poppe D. Glaue F. Herms S. Wernet P. Kögler G. Müller F.J. et al.Small molecules enable highly efficient neuronal conversion of human fibroblasts.Nat.

Small molecules enable neurogenin 2 to efficiently convert human fibroblasts into cholinergic neurons.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Fibroblast identity was verified and the cells were lentivirally transduced to express rtTA and a 2A-peptide-linked transcript coding for Ngn2 and Ascl1, resulting in transgenic, but silent and expandable, AN fibroblasts (Figures 2B and S1). For iN conversion, cells were transferred to conversion media containing small molecular inhibitors for TGFβ/SMAD and GSK3β signaling as well as enhancers of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) (Figure 2B). Under these conditions, fibroblasts underwent marked morphological changes, with typical neuronal morphologies appearing around week 2 of conversion and becoming more pronounced after 3 to 6 weeks. Neuronal cells stained positive for βIII-tubulin, phosphorylated human Tau (hTau), MAP2ab, and the mature neuronal marker NeuN, and most cells showed punctate staining for the glutamateric synaptic marker vGlut1 (Figure 2C). Non-neuronal cells showed typical fibroblast morphologies and Vimentin expression; cell division was not involved in the iN process (Figure S1). Following gentle relocation onto a layer of astrocytes during week 4 of conversion, iNs displayed pronounced human synapsin-I promoter-driven red fluorescent protein (RFP) fluorescence (LV-hSyn::RFP), mature neuronal morphologies, and punctate staining of synapsin-I at the intersections of neurites (Figure 2D). They also showed both evoked and spontaneous action potential firing (Figure 2E). We next applied this iN paradigm to our fibroblast cohort and found that cells from all ages efficiently converted into iNs that showed solid neuronal marker expression within 3 weeks (Figure 2F). Quantification revealed that, independent of donor age, typically over 50% of all DAPI-positive cells were positive for βIII-tubulin and hTau, around 40% expressed NeuN, and over 30% were consistently positive for MAP2ab (Figures 2G and S1). Equally, iNs generated from all tested donors (n = 13) displayed Na+/K+ channel-mediated inward/outward currents as well as multiple evoked action potentials with no apparent differences between iNs derived from young and old donors’ fibroblasts (Figure 2H). Quantification of neuronal subtype markers revealed that a consistent majority of the neurons adopted a glutamatergic fate and usually 15%–20% of the cells were gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-positive, whereas dopaminergic or serotoninergic markers were only sporadically observed (Figures 2I and S1). Using this iN protocol, functional iNs can be efficiently generated from fibroblasts of all ages with no apparent differences in their basic cellular and functional properties. To analyze the transcriptome of iNs via RNA-seq, neuronal RNA needs to be pure, with minimal fibroblast contamination that might confound analysis regarding cell aging. As live iNs express PSA-NCAM on the cell surface, we established a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based protocol for purification of neurons (Figures 3A and 3B ). Following sorting and plating on astrocytes, over 90% of human cells expressed βIII-tubulin, with over 95% of them also being hTau-positive (Figure 3C). Following prolonged culture, almost all human cells showed mature neuronal morphologies and marker expression (Figure 3D). We next performed RNA-seq analyses over the time course of conversion and observed dramatic gradual changes in gene expression (Figure 3E). Neuronal genes such as Dcx, NeuroD2, and Mapt, and voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels, synaptic proteins, and neurotransmitter receptors were strongly upregulated, whereas fibroblast genes such as dermokine (Dmkn), collagen, keratin, and cell-cycle genes such as Ccna2, Ccnb2, Nuf2, and Anln were dramatically downregulated (Figure S2; Table S4). Neighboring time points clustered together, indicating a gradual process of cell type conversion. Gene ontology (GO) term analysis of the 200 most strongly increased genes revealed highly significant enrichment of interacting factors that control neuron generation and function (Figures 3F and S2; Table S5). As expected, FACS-purified neurons showed marked enrichment of neuronal genes such as neuronal Ca2+ and K+ channels, glutamate receptors, synaptic proteins, and neuronal cytoskeletal markers as compared to their unsorted counterparts (Figures 3E and 3G), indicating efficient purification of iNs from remaining fibroblasts for RNA-seq. To explore our hypothesis that fibroblast-derived iNs retain information about their donor’s age, we performed RNA-seq analysis of iNs FACS-purified at 3 weeks of conversion (n = 22 samples from 18 donors). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on overall gene expression showed high similarity between all iN samples, and independently repeated iN conversions from the same fibroblasts reliably clustered together (Figure 4A). Strikingly, differential expression analysis between young (<40 years) and old (>40 years) fibroblasts and iNs revealed profound age-dependent gene expression in the iNs, with 202 genes significantly differentially expressed (FDR < 0.05; Figures 4B and 4C). In addition, linear correlation of normalized gene expression values with donor age confirmed that both fibroblasts and iNs showed a subset of genes progressively increasing or decreasing with age (Figure S3). Surprisingly, only seven of the differentially expressed genes overlapped between fibroblasts and iNs, as both cell types appeared to show cell-type-specific, age-dependent expression profiles (Figure 4D; Table S3). GO term and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that, in fibroblasts, genes involved in wound healing, stress response, and Ca2+ signaling—which are categories that have been previously been implicated in skin aging—were significantly altered (Figure 4E; Table S6) (Adler et al., 2007Adler A.S.

Enriched gene categories in aging iNs related to functional neuronal categories such as Ca2+ homeostasis, neuron projection, and regulation of synaptic plasticity (Figure 4F). Most interestingly, several genes from these categories, namely calcitonin (Calca), the cation channel Trpc6, the endothelin receptor Ednrb, and the catenin Ctnna1 also relate to the GO term “aging” (GO:0007568), which was also enriched in our aging iN system (Table S6). To further explore aging-related changes in gene expression, we performed RNA-seq analysis of 14 human prefrontal cortex samples from 0 up to 89 years of age and analyzed gene expression. First, we noticed that cortical samples consisted of RNA from multiple cell types as they contain large numbers of glial, neuronal, endothelial, and hematopoietic cell-derived transcripts, with neuron-derived RNA being only a minor fraction (Figure S4). We analyzed for differentially expressed aging genes and detected 49 highly significant (padj < 0.05) genes that overlapped between aging iNs and cortex, an overlap 7-fold higher than between iNs and fibroblasts. Further, cortical aging genes were enriched for several similar functional GO/KEGG categories like aging iNs, but also showed enrichment for genes involved in “learning and memory”, “Alzheimer’s disease”, “intracellular transport”, and other categories (Figure S4). Interestingly, we detected only three significant aging genes, LAMA3, PCDH10, and RANBP17, to be shared between aging fibroblasts, iNs, and the brain (Figure 5A). We reasoned that potential master regulators of aging might reveal themselves in this category. We became particularly interested in the nuclear pore-associated transport receptor RanBP17, which we found significantly downregulated in the elderly (Figure 5B). For validation of the RNA-seq data for RanBP17, we performed quantitative (q)PCR and western blotting, which both confirmed progressive reduction of RanBP17 with age (Figures 5B and S4). RanBP17 belongs to the importin-β family, which are involved in the transport of nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing cargo proteins through the nuclear pore complex by binding FG-repeat-containing nucleoporins (Koch et al., 2000Koch P. Bohlmann I. Schäfer M. Hansen-Hagge T.E. Kiyoi H. Wilda M. Hameister H. Bartram C.R. Janssen J.W.G. Identification of a novel putative Ran-binding protein and its close homologue.Biochem. Biophys.

Identification of RANBP16 and RANBP17 as novel interaction partners for the bHLH transcription factor E12.J. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 111: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In line with this, RanBP17 localized as a rim around the nucleus in both fibroblasts and neurons (Figure 5C). To further explore protein levels of RanBP17 in the aging human brain, we paraffin sectioned and immunostained ten of the cortex samples. All of them showed clear staining for βIII-tubulin in cortical neurons in the different layers (Figures 5D and 5E). Immunostaining for RanBP17 showed strong expression in layer II and III neurons of the young adult cortex, whereas it was often barely detectable above background in cortical neurons of old brains (Figures 5E and 5F). Quantification of neuronal RanBP17 immunofluorescence over background revealed significantly lower levels of RanBP17 in old brains compared to young (Figure 5G), and RanBP17 levels as determined by western blot analysis inversely correlated with age (Figures 5H and S4), thus confirming the decreasing expression RanBP17 protein with age in vivo. In addition, several independent “omics” studies showed RanBP17 consistently among the very top age-dependent genes in 519 samples of glioblastoma multiforme (Broad Institute TCGA Genome Data Analysis Center, 2014Broad Institute TCGA Genome Data Analysis CenterCorrelation between mRNA expression and clinical features.

Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, 2013https://doi.org/10.7908/C12B8W55Crossref Google Scholar; summarized in Figure S5). Based on these data, we reasoned that the decrease in RanBP17 might indicate a possible functional impairment of the nuclear pore in the aged. As the most prominent function of the nuclear pore is to maintain proper nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization (NCC), we established a reporter assay to measure NCC using lentiviral delivery of a dual reporter system (2Gi2R). This reporter consists of a fused double-GFP containing an NES sequence (2G:NES) and an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-linked double-RFP containing an NLS sequence (2R:NLS) (Figure 6A). Increased false localization of green fluorescence in the nucleus along with a simultaneous loss of nuclear red fluorescence (GFPnuc/RFPnuc), thus represents a measure for loss of NCC (Figure 6A). To test whether there is a detectable difference in NCC between cell populations, we measured GFPnuc/RFPnuc in nuclei of fibroblasts using automated region of interest (ROI) selection based on binarized DAPI images from confocal sections (Figure 6B). To first test the applicability of our NCC assay, we overexpressed the HIV-1 protein Vpr in young fibroblasts since Vpr is suspected of altering the integrity of the nuclear envelope (Blömer et al., 1997Blömer U. Naldini L. Kafri T. Trono D. Verma I.M. Gage F.H. Highly efficient and sustained gene transfer in adult neurons with a lentivirus vector.J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6641-6649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Guenzel et al., 2014Guenzel C.A. Hérate C. Benichou S. HIV-1 Vpr-a still “enigmatic multitasker”.Front Microbiol. 2014; 5: 127Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Vpr overexpression resulted in a marked increase in GFPnuc/RFPnuc ratios (Figure S6). Treatment of cells with the nuclear export inhibitor Leptomycin B resulted in a progressive increase in green fluorescence in the nucleus over time, paralleled by increasing GFPnuc/RFPnuc ratios, which were solely attributed to increasing mislocalization of 2G:NES over time (Figure S6). Most interestingly, fibroblasts derived from old donors showed relatively more GFP in the nucleus and more RFP in the cytoplasm (Figure 6C). Quantification revealed a significant impairment of NCC in old compared to young and middle-aged donor-derived cells (Figure 6D). Loss of NCC significantly correlated with donor age as well as with RanBP17 expression levels (Figures 6E and S6). Thus, using 2Gi2R as a sensitive NCC reporter, we were able to identify an age-dependent impairment of NCC in old donor-derived human fibroblasts. Further, as 3-week-old iNs showed aging transcriptome signatures, including decreased RanBP17 levels in the old, we asked whether mature and functional iNs from old donors possessed altered NCC. We transduced iNs with the 2Gi2R reporter and let them mature on astrocytes until week 6 (Figure 6F). Mature neurons showed complex morphologies and solid expression of the NCC reporter proteins (Figure 6G). Strikingly, iNs from the oldest donors showed significantly increased GFPnuc/RFPnuc ratios compared to both middle-aged (29 year–50 year) and young donor-derived iNs (Figure 6H). Strongly affected neurons showed obvious compartmentalization defects; the extent of the detected loss of neuronal NCC significantly correlated with donor age and RanBP17 expression (Figure S6). These data show that, in addition to transcriptomic changes after 3 weeks of conversion, mature human iNs show functional NCC impairment, thus implicating NCC as an important functional signature of old human neurons. To confirm age-related NCC impairment, we next applied fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) as a second assay to measure compartmentalization to our aging fibroblasts. For this, we performed live-cell analysis of a shuttling 2xGFP:NLS:NES probe in young and old fibroblasts. FLIP revealed significantly longer half-life times in old donor-derived cells, indicating less efficient shuttling of the 2xGFP:NLS:NES probe (Figure S6). This observation represents an additional experimental measure supporting observed NCC defects as detected using the 2Gi2R assay. To examine whether the age-dependent loss of RanBP17 plays an active role in the age-dependent loss of NCC, we generated lentiviruses carrying short hairpin (sh)RNAs against RanBP17 (iR#1 and iR#2; Figure 7A). Efficient knock down of RanBP17 was achieved with both constructs on protein and mRNA levels (Figures 7B and 7C), but cells transduced with iR#2 showed a stronger mRNA decrease and signs of toxicity after 5 days (data not shown). Moderate knock down using iR#1 resulted in a marked increase in GFPnuc/RFPnuc in different cell lines, suggesting a causative role for RanBP17 in the loss of NCC in old cells (Figure 7D). Interestingly, knock down of RanBP17 in young fibroblasts (1 year) changed the expression of 68% of the 78 identified fibroblast aging genes in the same direction, as was observed in progressive aging, further strengthening the idea that RanBP17 plays an upstream role for the cellular aging phenotypes (Figure 7E).

https://openalex.org/W2169769306,"The shortage of organs for transplantation is a major barrier to the treatment of organ failure. Although porcine organs are considered promising, their use has been checked by concerns about the transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) to humans. Here we describe the eradication of all PERVs in a porcine kidney epithelial cell line (PK15). We first determined the PK15 PERV copy number to be 62. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we disrupted all copies of the PERV pol gene and demonstrated a >1000-fold reduction in PERV transmission to human cells, using our engineered cells. Our study shows that CRISPR-Cas9 multiplexability can be as high as 62 and demonstrates the possibility that PERVs can be inactivated for clinical application of porcine-to-human xenotransplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2239158335,"Alanine, serine, cysteine-preferring transporter 2 (ASCT2; SLC1A5) mediates uptake of glutamine, a conditionally essential amino acid in rapidly proliferating tumour cells. Uptake of glutamine and subsequent glutaminolysis is critical for activation of the mTORC1 nutrient-sensing pathway, which regulates cell growth and protein translation in cancer cells. This is of particular interest in breast cancer, as glutamine dependence is increased in high-risk breast cancer subtypes. Pharmacological inhibitors of ASCT2-mediated transport significantly reduced glutamine uptake in human breast cancer cell lines, leading to the suppression of mTORC1 signalling, cell growth and cell cycle progression. Notably, these effects were subtype-dependent, with ASCT2 transport critical only for triple-negative (TN) basal-like breast cancer cell growth compared with minimal effects in luminal breast cancer cells. Both stable and inducible shRNA-mediated ASCT2 knockdown confirmed that inhibiting ASCT2 function was sufficient to prevent cellular proliferation and induce rapid cell death in TN basal-like breast cancer cells, but not in luminal cells. Using a bioluminescent orthotopic xenograft mouse model, ASCT2 expression was then shown to be necessary for both successful engraftment and growth of HCC1806 TN breast cancer cells in vivo. Lower tumoral expression of ASCT2 conferred a significant survival advantage in xenografted mice. These responses remained intact in primary breast cancers, where gene expression analysis showed high expression of ASCT2 and glutamine metabolism-related genes, including GLUL and GLS, in a cohort of 90 TN breast cancer patients, as well as correlations with the transcriptional regulators, MYC and ATF4. This study provides preclinical evidence for the feasibility of novel therapies exploiting ASCT2 transporter activity in breast cancer, particularly in the high-risk basal-like subgroup of TN breast cancer where there is not only high expression of ASCT2, but also a marked reliance on its activity for sustained cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2213750320,"The mammalian basal forebrain (BF) has important roles in controlling sleep and wakefulness, but the underlying neural circuit remains poorly understood. We examined the BF circuit by recording and optogenetically perturbing the activity of four genetically defined cell types across sleep-wake cycles and by comprehensively mapping their synaptic connections. Recordings from channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-tagged neurons revealed that three BF cell types, cholinergic, glutamatergic and parvalbumin-positive (PV+) GABAergic neurons, were more active during wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (wake/REM active) than during non-REM (NREM) sleep, and activation of each cell type rapidly induced wakefulness. By contrast, activation of somatostatin-positive (SOM+) GABAergic neurons promoted NREM sleep, although only some of them were NREM active. Synaptically, the wake-promoting neurons were organized hierarchically by glutamatergic→cholinergic→PV+ neuron excitatory connections, and they all received inhibition from SOM+ neurons. Together, these findings reveal the basic organization of the BF circuit for sleep-wake control."
https://openalex.org/W1951061860,"Master transcription factors interact with DNA to establish cell type identity and to regulate gene expression in mammalian cells. The genome-wide map of these transcription factor binding sites has been termed the cistrome. Here we show that the androgen receptor (AR) cistrome undergoes extensive reprogramming during prostate epithelial transformation in man. Using human prostate tissue, we observed a core set of AR binding sites that are consistently reprogrammed in tumors. FOXA1 and HOXB13 colocalized at the reprogrammed AR binding sites in human tumor tissue. Introduction of FOXA1 and HOXB13 into an immortalized prostate cell line reprogrammed the AR cistrome to resemble that of a prostate tumor, functionally linking these specific factors to AR cistrome reprogramming. These findings offer mechanistic insights into a key set of events that drive normal prostate epithelium toward transformation and establish the centrality of epigenetic reprogramming in human prostate tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1960633973,"Cancer-associated muscle weakness is a poorly understood phenomenon, and there is no effective treatment. Here we find that seven different mouse models of human osteolytic bone metastases-representing breast, lung and prostate cancers, as well as multiple myeloma-exhibited impaired muscle function, implicating a role for the tumor-bone microenvironment in cancer-associated muscle weakness. We found that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, released from the bone surface as a result of metastasis-induced bone destruction, upregulated NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), resulting in elevated oxidization of skeletal muscle proteins, including the ryanodine receptor and calcium (Ca(2+)) release channel (RyR1). The oxidized RyR1 channels leaked Ca(2+), resulting in lower intracellular signaling, which is required for proper muscle contraction. We found that inhibiting RyR1 leakage, TGF-β signaling, TGF-β release from bone or Nox4 activity improved muscle function in mice with MDA-MB-231 bone metastases. Humans with breast- or lung cancer-associated bone metastases also had oxidized skeletal muscle RyR1 that is not seen in normal muscle. Similarly, skeletal muscle weakness, increased Nox4 binding to RyR1 and oxidation of RyR1 were present in a mouse model of Camurati-Engelmann disease, a nonmalignant metabolic bone disorder associated with increased TGF-β activity. Thus, pathological TGF-β release from bone contributes to muscle weakness by decreasing Ca(2+)-induced muscle force production."
https://openalex.org/W1911750425,"The mechanisms by which intrinsically disordered proteins engage in rapid and highly selective binding is a subject of considerable interest and represents a central paradigm to nuclear pore complex (NPC) function, where nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) move through the NPC by binding disordered phenylalanine-glycine-rich nucleoporins (FG-Nups). Combining single-molecule fluorescence, molecular simulations, and nuclear magnetic resonance, we show that a rapidly fluctuating FG-Nup populates an ensemble of conformations that are prone to bind NTRs with near diffusion-limited on rates, as shown by stopped-flow kinetic measurements. This is achieved using multiple, minimalistic, low-affinity binding motifs that are in rapid exchange when engaging with the NTR, allowing the FG-Nup to maintain an unexpectedly high plasticity in its bound state. We propose that these exceptional physical characteristics enable a rapid and specific transport mechanism in the physiological context, a notion supported by single molecule in-cell assays on intact NPCs."
https://openalex.org/W2176412441,"Reactive astrocytes (RAs) have been reported to convert to multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) capable of neurosphere (NS) formation and multilineage differentiation in vitro. Using genetic tagging, we determined that subventricular zone (SVZ) NSCs give rise to NSs derived from the stroke-injured cortex. We demonstrate that these cells can be isolated from the cortex in two different models of stroke and from different stroke-lesioned cortical regions. Interestingly, SVZ NSCs give rise to a subpopulation of RAs in the cortex that contribute to astrogliosis and scar formation. Last, we show that these SVZ derived RAs can be converted to neurons in vivo by forced expression of Ascl1. Identifying the contribution of cells originating from the SVZ to injury repair has implications for neural regeneration strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2162079601,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) of childhood with a poor prognosis. Mutations in NF1, NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11 or CBL occur in 85% of patients, yet there are currently no risk stratification algorithms capable of predicting which patients will be refractory to conventional treatment and could therefore be candidates for experimental therapies. In addition, few molecular pathways aside from the RAS-MAPK pathway have been identified that could serve as the basis for such novel therapeutic strategies. We therefore sought to genomically characterize serial samples from patients at diagnosis through relapse and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia to expand knowledge of the mutational spectrum in JMML. We identified recurrent mutations in genes involved in signal transduction, splicing, Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and transcription. Notably, the number of somatic alterations present at diagnosis appears to be the major determinant of outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2181008927,"The elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) is likely to be essential for a preventative HIV-1 vaccine, but this has not yet been achieved by immunization. In contrast, some HIV-1-infected individuals naturally mount bNAb responses during chronic infection, suggesting that years of maturation may be required for neutralization breadth. Recent studies have shown that viral diversification precedes the emergence of bNAbs, but the significance of this observation is unknown. Here we delineate the key viral events that drove neutralization breadth within the CAP256-VRC26 family of 33 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from a superinfected individual. First, we identified minority viral variants, termed bNAb-initiating envelopes, that were distinct from both of the transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses and that efficiently engaged the bNAb precursor. Second, deep sequencing revealed a pool of diverse epitope variants (immunotypes) that were preferentially neutralized by broader members of the antibody lineage. In contrast, a 'dead-end' antibody sublineage unable to neutralize these immunotypes showed limited evolution and failed to develop breadth. Thus, early viral escape at key antibody-virus contact sites selects for antibody sublineages that can tolerate these changes, thereby providing a mechanism for the generation of neutralization breadth within a developing antibody lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2131599797,"Type VI secretion (T6S) influences the composition of microbial communities by catalyzing the delivery of toxins between adjacent bacterial cells. Here, we demonstrate that a T6S integral membrane toxin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Tse6, acts on target cells by degrading the universally essential dinucleotides NAD(+) and NADP(+). Structural analyses of Tse6 show that it resembles mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase proteins, such as diphtheria toxin, with the exception of a unique loop that both excludes proteinaceous ADP-ribose acceptors and contributes to hydrolysis. We find that entry of Tse6 into target cells requires its binding to an essential housekeeping protein, translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). These proteins participate in a larger assembly that additionally directs toxin export and provides chaperone activity. Visualization of this complex by electron microscopy defines the architecture of a toxin-loaded T6S apparatus and provides mechanistic insight into intercellular membrane protein delivery between bacteria."

Notably, medial prefrontal layer 5 neurons receive more long-distance inputs and more local inhibitory inputs than layer 5 neurons in barrel cortex. Information processing in neocortical circuits requires integrating inputs over a wide range of spatial scales, from local microcircuits to long-range cortical and subcortical connections. We used rabies virus–based trans-synaptic tracing to analyze the laminar distribution of local and long-range inputs to pyramidal neurons in the mouse barrel cortex and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In barrel cortex, we found substantial inputs from layer 3 (L3) to L6, prevalent translaminar inhibitory inputs, and long-range inputs to L2/3 or L5/6 preferentially from L2/3 or L5/6 of input cortical areas, respectively. These layer-specific input patterns were largely independent of NMDA receptor function in the recipient neurons. mPFC L5 received proportionally more long-range inputs and more local inhibitory inputs than barrel cortex L5. Our results provide new insight into the organization and development of neocortical networks and identify important differences in the circuit organization in sensory and association cortices."

Thus, DNP makes structural studies of proteins at endogenous levels in biological contexts possible, and such contexts can influence protein structure. Structural investigations of biomolecules are typically confined to in vitro systems under limited conditions. Although investigations yield invaluable insights, such experiments can never capture all aspects of complex biological environments. Proteins must fold into their active conformations in complex environments. This situation becomes perilous when considering proteins that must attain a particular conformation, but whose energetic folding landscapes are rather flat or have several local minima. In these cases, the environment can clearly influence the conformation by favoring one pathway over another. Such decisions can have striking biological consequences, as is the case for a variety of protein folding diseases (Dobson, 2001Dobson C.M. The structural basis of protein folding and its links with human disease.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The effect of environment becomes even more critical when considering the substantial fraction of the human proteome that encodes disordered proteins (Dunker et al., 2001Dunker A.K. Lawson J.D. Brown C.J. Williams R.M. Romero P. Oh J.S. Oldfield C.J. Campen A.M. Ratliff C.M. Hipps K.W. et al.Intrinsically disordered protein.J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2001; 19: 26-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar). Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are important components of the cellular signaling machinery, allowing the same polypeptide to undertake different interactions with different consequences (Wright and Dyson, 2015Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Intrinsically disordered proteins incellular signalling and regulation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 18-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Yet, structural characterization of these domains is notoriously difficult (Uversky, 2013Uversky V.N. A decade and a half of protein intrinsic disorder: biology still waits for physics.Protein Sci. 2013; 22: 693-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Yeast prions present both of these structural challenges as they have both environmentally sensitive protein folding landscapes as well as intrinsically disordered regions. Yeast prions have provided a paradigm shift in our understanding of heritable biological information. They allow specific biological traits to be encoded and inherited solely though self-templating protein conformations. When a protein switches to its prion conformation, its function changes. This altered function is passed from generation to generation by conformational self-templating and catalyzed division of the template to daughter cells. The most extensively studied yeast prion, [PSI+] (Cox, 1965Cox B.S. Ψ, A cytoplasmic suppressor of super-suppressor in yeast.Heredity. 1965; 20: 505-521Crossref Scopus (470) Google Scholar), is an amyloid conformer of the translation termination factor Sup35. In purified amyloid fibrils of the prion domain of Sup35, called NM, the N-terminal domain (N) adopts a beta-sheet-rich amyloid conformation while the adjacent middle domain (M) is intrinsically disordered (Frederick et al., 2014Frederick K.K.

However, this is unlikely to be the case in vivo: the M domain is known to interact with many other biomolecules, including protein remodeling factors that regulate prion inheritance.

Chem. 2012; 287: 542-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Finally, a host of genetic data suggests that protein-based inheritance is sensitive to the combination and stoichiometry of many other proteins, meaning that isolated study of prion structure can offer at best only partial insight into this paradigm shifting biology. Interest in prions is highlighted by the fact that similar structural transitions figure in the pathologies of a wide variety of human diseases.

A key strength of this technique is that it can be used to study non-crystalline, amorphous samples. Indeed, there have been a handful of high-profile in-cell NMR studies (Banci et al., 2013Banci L.

Biotechnol. 2011; 47: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that while protein structure can be perturbed, it is largely unchanged by the cellular context. However, these studies employed solution-state NMR to detect proteins at concentrations two or more orders of magnitude above endogenous levels inside cells, radically altering endogenous stoichiometries. Because solution-state NMR is limited by molecular tumbling times (that depend upon molecular size and solvent viscosity), the minority of the protein that might interact with cellular components would likely be undetectable. Moreover, because this population would comprise a small fraction of the total biomolecule, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to detect the resulting signal loss. Solid state NMR is not limited by molecular correlation times in this way. Instead, solid-state NMR is limited by its low sensitivity. Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) has the potential to alleviate this limitation by dramatically increasing the sensitivity of NMR spectroscopy, through the transfer of the large spin polarization that is associated with unpaired electrons to nearby nuclei (Abragam, 1983Abragam A. The Principles of Nuclear Magnetism. Clarendon Press, 1983Google Scholar, Slichter, 1990Slichter C.P. Principles of Magnetic Resonance. Springer Science and Business Media, 1990Crossref Google Scholar). Theoretically, DNP can reduce experimental times by more than five orders of magnitude; an experiment that would require decades without DNP can be collected in a day with DNP. However, just as for other structural biology techniques, DNP sensitivity enhancements are critically dependent on experimental conditions (Ni et al., 2013Ni Q.Z. Daviso E. Can T.V. Markhasin E.

Several groups have applied DNP to investigate membrane proteins that were overexpressed to high levels in bacteria and have directly examined both concentrated membrane fractions and whole cells (Jacso et al., 2012Jacso T.

We report conditions that enable high polarization transfer efficiencies in biologically complex environments. These are large enough to allow the characterization of a single protein at endogenous concentrations in its native environment. Structural methods to investigate either intrinsically disordered proteins or environmentally sensitive protein folding are limited. Here, we present a generalizable approach for investigation of both of these challenging structural puzzles that lie at the heart of both fundamental biological questions and human diseases. Moreover, we demonstrate that including the biological context can influence protein structure. We first confirmed the NM protein adopted its active conformation at endogenous concentrations in a native environment. Previous studies have employed extensive serial dilution and propagation in purified in vitro conditions (Frederick et al., 2014Frederick K.K. Debelouchina G.T. Kayatekin C. Dorminy T. Jacavone A.C.

Biol. 2014; 21: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To ensure that the exogenously added protein was faithfully templated by the prion conformers from the cell lysate, we probed its structural state using semi-denaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE) (Bagriantsev et al., 2006Bagriantsev S.N.

Screening for amyloid aggregation by semi-denaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis.J. Vis. Exp. 2008; 17: 838PubMed Google Scholar). NM did not form amyloid in lysates from cells that do not harbor the [PSI+] prion form of Sup35 (Figure 1B). In contrast, NM was templated into an amyloid form by both purified pre-formed fibers and lysates from cells that harbored the prion. We determined the concentration of templated, exogenously added NM was ∼1 μM by immunoblot (Figure 1C), in good agreement with previously reported endogenous Sup35 concentrations of 2.5–5 μM (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.-K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O’Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar). In this way, we prepared samples of isotopically labeled NM amyloids at endogenous levels in a complex biological environment. Having established that NM adopts an amyloid conformation in cellular lysates, we prepared recombinant, 1H, 13C-labeled NM and added it to cell lysates that had been grown in deuterated media with carbon isotopes in natural abundance. This created a spectroscopically active prion protein in an NMR silent cellular background. We prepared the sample for DNP magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR by addition of cryoprotectant (glycerol) and a stable biradical TOTAPOL (Song et al., 2006Song C. Hu K.-N. Joo C.-G. Swager T.M. Griffin R.G. TOTAPOL: a biradical polarizing agent for dynamic nuclear polarization experiments in aqueous media.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 11385-11390Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). We collected 1D 13C{1H} cross polarization (CP) spectra of the cellular lysates both with and without microwave-driven polarization transfer from electrons to nuclei (DNP). Experiments using DNP resulted in significant signal enhancements relative to conventional NMR. DNP signal enhancements (ε) at 211 MHz were between 50- and 115-fold (Figures 2 and S1). The carbonyl carbon enhancements were similar to the maximal enhancements obtained for the reference system proline (ε = 130) for this instrumental configuration. This establishes that DNP MAS NMR is well-suited to study complex biological mixtures.Figure S1Polarization Build-Up Curves for Different Chemical Groups for 1H 13C-Labeled NM in Deuterated Cellular Lysates Cryoprotected with d8-13C-Depleted Glycerol at 211 MHz, Related to Figure 2Show full captionA fit using a biexponential build-up function resulted in a fast build-up time of 3.8 s and a slow build up time of 13.3 s for the blue curve, which has a minor contribution from protonated Cα sites. A reviewer asked about potential TOTAPOL binding sites on the protein surface. This is unlikely to be a concern, especially because if there are specific binding sites for TOTAPOL that lead to signal quenching of prolines and lysines, we would expect this effect to be enhanced in the lysate samples, where the relative ratio of TOTAPOL of NM is several orders of magnitude higher than in the purified samples. Instead, we see an increased diversity of chemical shift values in the lysate samples for these residues relative to the purified samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A fit using a biexponential build-up function resulted in a fast build-up time of 3.8 s and a slow build up time of 13.3 s for the blue curve, which has a minor contribution from protonated Cα sites.

Instead, we see an increased diversity of chemical shift values in the lysate samples for these residues relative to the purified samples. DNP enhances the NMR signal of all 13C atoms in the sample. Interestingly, in samples with the uniformly 13C-labeled protein at endogenous concentrations, the 13C content from its natural abundance is an order of magnitude larger than that of added NM protein. However, because the natural abundance of 13C is 1.1%, only 0.01% of the 13C sites in the cell lysate were adjacent to another 13C site. Conversely, all the 13C sites in the exogenously added uniformly 13C-labeled NM had adjacent 13C sites. To isolate 13C signals from NM and filter out background 13C signals from the cell lysates, we collected one-bond 13C-13C dipolar recoupled correlation spectra using proton driven spin diffusion (PDSD) (Szeverenyi et al., 1982Szeverenyi N.M. Sullivan M.J. Maciel G.E. Observation of spin exchange by two-dimensional fourier transform 13C cross polarization-magic-angle spinning.J. Magn. Reson. (1969). 1982; 47: 462-475Crossref Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In this 2D experiment, on-diagonal peaks report on all 13C sites in the sample while off-diagonal peaks, or cross-peaks, report only on 13C sites that are directly bonded to another 13C site. To determine the contributions of cell lysates to the 13C-13C correlation spectra, we used signals from β1,3-glucan, a major cell wall component that is well-resolved from protein signals. As expected, the ratio of the cross-peak C1-C2 signal intensity relative to the diagonal C1 signal for β1,3-glucan was 2.5% ± 2% of that for yeast grown on uniformly 13C-enriched glucose. However, the ratio of the protein carbonyl carbon (C′)–carbon alpha (Cα) cross-peak signal intensity relative to the diagonal C′ signal intensity for the protein backbone region was 10-fold higher (21% ± 2%) for the natural abundance sample containing added 13C NM than the ratio for the β1,3-glucan region. The protein signal was an order of magnitude larger than the lysate background expected from natural abundance, establishing that the cross-peak signals in the 13C-13C correlation spectra report on the added NM and not on 13C in the cellular lysates. To completely eliminate any concerns about the contribution of natural abundance 13C from the cellular lysates, samples of prion-containing yeasts for structural investigations were grown with 13C-depleted (99.9% 12C) glucose as the carbon source, further reducing the 13C cross-peak intensity from the cellular lysates by two orders of magnitude. Thus, the combination of DNP with this isotopic labeling scheme provides the sensitivity and specificity to observe a protein at endogenous levels in a biologically complex native environment. To investigate the structural influence of cellular lysates on NM amyloid assembly, we compared spectra of NM fibers at endogenous levels in cellular lysates to spectra of purified lysate-templated NM fibers (Frederick et al., 2014Frederick K.K. Debelouchina G.T. Kayatekin C. Dorminy T. Jacavone A.C. Griffin R.G. Lindquist S. Distinct prion strains are defined by amyloid core structure and chaperone binding site dynamics.Chem.

We conducted these experiments at higher magnetic fields (700 MHz rather than 211 MHz) to achieve significant improvements in spectral resolution (Barnes et al., 2012Barnes A.B. Markhasin E.

For 10 μg of NM fibrils in unlabeled cellular lysates, we collected a one-bond 13C-13C DARR spectrum for 1 week. As expected, no cross-peaks for β1,3 glucan were present in spectra of cellular lysates grown in depleted 13C glucose. Inhomogeneous line broadening due to experimental temperatures required for DNP (83 K) potentially counteracts any gain in spectral resolution from higher magnetic fields. Thus, we compared spectra of purified NM fibers under DNP conditions to spectra of purified NM fibers at room temperature. In both samples, most of the resonances overlapped due to the number of sites and highly degenerate amino acid composition of this protein, a common feature of prion protei"

We therefore evaluated if SUDOSCAN, a new method developed to provide a quick, non-invasive and quantitative assessment of sudomotor function can reliably screen for DPN. 70 subjects (45 with type 1 diabetes and 25 healthy volunteers [HV]) underwent detailed assessments including clinical, neurophysiological and 5 standard cardiovascular reflex tests (CARTs). Using the American Academy of Neurology criteria subjects were classified into DPN and No-DPN groups. Based on CARTs subjects were also divided into CAN, subclinical-CAN and no-CAN. Sudomotor function was assessed with measurement of hand and foot Electrochemical Skin Conductance (ESC) and calculation of the CAN risk score. Foot ESC (μS) was significantly lower in subjects with DPN [n = 24; 53.5(25.1)] compared to the No-DPN [77.0(7.9)] and HV [77.1(14.3)] groups (ANCOVA p<0.001). Sensitivity and specificity of foot ESC for classifying DPN were 87.5% and 76.2%, respectively. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.85. Subjects with CAN had significantly lower foot [55.0(28.2)] and hand [53.5(19.6)] ESC compared to No-CAN [foot ESC, 72.1(12.2); hand ESC 64.9(14.4)] and HV groups (ANCOVA p<0.001 and 0.001, respectively). ROC analysis of CAN risk score to correctly classify CAN revealed a sensitivity of 65.0% and specificity of 80.0%. AUC was 0.75. Both foot and hand ESC demonstrated strong correlation with individual parameters and composite scores of nerve conduction and CAN. SUDOSCAN, a non-invasive and quick test, could be used as an objective screening test for DPN in busy diabetic clinics, insuring adherence to current recommendation of annual assessments for all diabetic patients that remains unfulfilled."

What are the circuit algorithms that allow the brain to extract such behaviorally vital visual cues? Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in Drosophila, we describe direction selective signals in the dendrites of T4 and T5 neurons, detectors of local motion. We demonstrate that this circuit performs selective amplification of local light inputs, an observation that constrains motion detection models and confirms a core prediction of the Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator (HRC). These neurons are also orientation selective, responding strongly to static features that are orthogonal to their preferred axis of motion, a tuning property not predicted by the HRC. This coincident extraction of orientation and direction sharpens directional tuning through surround inhibition and reveals a striking parallel between visual processing in flies and vertebrate cortex, suggesting a universal strategy for motion processing."
https://openalex.org/W1913776872,"Tumor cachexia is an important prognostic parameter in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Tumor cachexia is characterized by metabolic and inflammatory disturbances. These conditions might be reflected by body composition measurements (BCMs) ascertained by pre-operative computed tomography (CT). Thus, we aimed to identify the prognostically most relevant BCMs assessed by pre-operative CT in EOC patients.We evaluated muscle BCMs and well established markers of nutritional and inflammatory status, as well as clinical-pathological parameters in 140 consecutive patients with EOC. Furthermore, a multiplexed inflammatory marker panel of 25 cytokines was used to determine the relationship of BCMs with inflammatory markers and patient's outcome. All relevant parameters were evaluated in uni- and multivariate survival analysis.Muscle attenuation (MA)-a well established BCM parameter-is an independent prognostic factor for survival in multivariate analysis (HR 2.25; p = 0.028). Low MA-reflecting a state of cachexia-is also associated with residual tumor after cytoreductive surgery (p = 0.046) and with an unfavorable performance status (p = 0.015). Moreover, MA is associated with Eotaxin and IL-10 out of the 25 cytokine multiplex marker panel in multivariate linear regression analysis (p = 0.021 and p = 0.047, respectively).MA-ascertained by routine pre-operative CT-is an independent prognostic parameter in EOC patients. Low MA is associated with the inflammatory, as well as the nutritional component of cachexia. Therefore, the clinical value of pre-operative CT could be enhanced by the assessment of MA."
https://openalex.org/W2228056930,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), which is a poor prognosis malignancy that arises from the malignant transformation of cholangiocytes, is associated with chronic inflammation of the biliary epithelium. Thus far, the molecular mechanisms of the origin and neoplastic processes of CCA that are promoted by inflammation are still unclear and need to be fully elucidated. Here using small RNA sequencing to determine the microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in CCA, we found that let-7c, miR-99a and miR-125b, which are three miRNAs of the same cluster, were downregulated in CCA and targeted interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-6R and type 1 insulin-like growth factor, which are important cytokines and receptors of the IL-6/signal transducer and activator 3 (STAT3) pathway and have key roles in inflammation and CCA initiation. We also found that enforced expression of let-7c, miR-99a or miR-125b could reduce the activity of STAT3 and further suppress CCA tumorigenicity in vivo and inhibit the migration and invasion of CCA cells in vitro. Surprisingly, let-7c/miR-99a/miR-125b cluster also significantly decreased the ability of CCA cells for cancer stem cell-like mammosphere generation by downregulating CD133 and CD44, which suggests the pivotal roles of let-7c, miR-99a and miR-125b in CCA by regulating both inflammation and stem-like properties. Our findings showed potential links between miRNAs and inflammation, and provide a potential treatment strategy for developing an miRNA-based therapy via IL-6/STAT3 targeting for CCA."
https://openalex.org/W2238015399,"Recently, germline and somatic heterozygous mutations in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRB) have been associated with familial infantile myofibromatosis (IM), which is characterized by soft tissue tumors, and overgrowth syndrome, a disease that predisposes to cancer. These mutations have not been functionally characterized. In the present study, the activity of three PDGFRB mutants associated with familial IM (R561C, P660T and N666K) and one PDGFRB mutant found in patients with overgrowth syndrome (P584R) was tested in various models. The P660T mutant showed no difference with the wild-type receptor, suggesting that it might represent a polymorphic variant unrelated to the disease. By contrast, the three other mutants were constitutively active and able to transform NIH3T3 and Ba/F3 cells to different extents. In particular, the germline mutant identified in overgrowth syndrome, P584R, was a stronger oncogene than the germline R561C mutant associated with myofibromatosis. The distinct phenotypes associated with these two mutations could be related to this difference of potency. Importantly, all activated mutants were sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, nilotinib and ponatinib. In conclusion, the PDGFRB mutations previously identified in familial IM and overgrowth syndrome activate the receptor in the absence of ligand, supporting the hypothesis that these mutations cause the diseases. Moreover, imatinib seems to be a promising treatment for patients carrying these mutations. To our knowledge, these are the first confirmed gain-of-function point mutations of PDGFRB in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2261160019,"Acquisition parameters play a crucial role in Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), as they have a major impact on the values of scalar measures such as Fractional Anisotropy (FA) or Mean Diffusivity (MD) that are usually the focus of clinical studies based on white matter analysis. This paper presents an analysis on the impact of the variation of several acquisition parameters on these scalar measures with a novel double focus. First, a tractography-based approach is employed, motivated by the significant number of clinical studies that are carried out using this technique. Second, the consequences of simultaneous changes in multiple parameters are analyzed: number of gradient directions, b-value and voxel resolution. Results indicate that the FA is most affected by changes in the number of gradients and voxel resolution, while MD is specially influenced by variations in the b-value. Even if the choice of a tractography algorithm has an effect on the numerical values of the final scalar measures, the evolution of these measures when acquisition parameters are modified is parallel."
https://openalex.org/W1898500759,"Isernia La Pineta (south-central Italy, Molise) is one of the most important archaeological localities of the Middle Pleistocene in Western Europe. It is an extensive open-air site with abundant lithic industry and faunal remains distributed across four stratified archaeosurfaces that have been found in two sectors of the excavation (3c, 3a, 3s10 in sect. I; 3a in sect. II). The prehistoric attendance was close to a wet environment, with a series of small waterfalls and lakes associated to calcareous tufa deposits. An isolated human deciduous incisor (labelled IS42) was discovered in 2014 within the archaeological level 3 coll (overlying layer 3a) that, according to new 40Ar/39Ar measurements, is dated to about 583–561 ka, i.e. to the end of marine isotope stage (MIS) 15. Thus, the tooth is currently the oldest human fossil specimen in Italy; it is an important addition to the scanty European fossil record of the Middle Pleistocene, being associated with a lithic assemblage of local raw materials (flint and limestone) characterized by the absence of handaxes and reduction strategies primarily aimed at the production of small/medium-sized flakes. The faunal assemblage is dominated by ungulates often bearing cut marks. Combining chronology with the archaeological evidence, Isernia La Pineta exhibits a delay in the appearance of handaxes with respect to other European Palaeolithic sites of the Middle Pleistocene. Interestingly, this observation matches the persistence of archaic morphological features shown by the human calvarium from the Middle Pleistocene site of Ceprano, not far from Isernia (south-central Italy, Latium). In this perspective, our analysis is aimed to evaluate morphological features occurring in IS42."
https://openalex.org/W1711839986,"A mechanistic model for Botrytis cinerea on grapevine was developed. The model, which accounts for conidia production on various inoculum sources and for multiple infection pathways, considers two infection periods. During the first period (“inflorescences clearly visible” to “berries groat-sized”), the model calculates: i) infection severity on inflorescences and young clusters caused by conidia (SEV1). During the second period (“majority of berries touching” to “berries ripe for harvest”), the model calculates: ii) infection severity of ripening berries by conidia (SEV2); and iii) severity of berry-to-berry infection caused by mycelium (SEV3). The model was validated in 21 epidemics (vineyard × year combinations) between 2009 and 2014 in Italy and France. A discriminant function analysis (DFA) was used to: i) evaluate the ability of the model to predict mild, intermediate, and severe epidemics; and ii) assess how SEV1, SEV2, and SEV3 contribute to epidemics. The model correctly classified the severity of 17 of 21 epidemics. Results from DFA were also used to calculate the daily probabilities that an ongoing epidemic would be mild, intermediate, or severe. SEV1 was the most influential variable in discriminating between mild and intermediate epidemics, whereas SEV2 and SEV3 were relevant for discriminating between intermediate and severe epidemics. The model represents an improvement of previous B. cinerea models in viticulture and could be useful for making decisions about Botrytis bunch rot control."
https://openalex.org/W2211429706,"Because malignant cells have altered, usually accelerated, energy consumption, targeting metabolic signaling represents a prevailing strategy for tumor therapy. Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is a proximal signaling molecule of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which is required for metabolic activation. It is still lacking definitive evidence whether inactivation of PDK1 can overwhelm tumorigenesis in vivo. Herein we revealed that mammary-specific ablation of PDK1 could delay tumor initiation, progression and metastasis in a spontaneous mouse tumor model. We also demonstrated that inducible deletion of PDK1 could noticeably shrink the growing breast tumors. However, a small portion of PDK1-deficient tumorigenic cells eventually established tumor lesions, albeit at a relatively later phase, most likely owing to compensatory upregulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation. Consequently, simultaneous inhibition of PDK1 and Erk1/2 impeded the survival of breast cancer cells. Thus we identify PDK1 as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer, particularly in combination with an Erk1/2 inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1943388322,"Sensory inputs are often fluctuating and intermittent, yet animals reliably utilize them to direct behavior. Here we ask how natural stimulus fluctuations influence the dynamic neural encoding of odors. Using the locust olfactory system, we isolated two main causes of odor intermittency: chaotic odor plumes and active sampling behaviors. Despite their irregularity, chaotic odor plumes still drove dynamic neural response features including the synchronization, temporal patterning, and short-term plasticity of spiking in projection neurons, enabling classifier-based stimulus identification and activating downstream decoders (Kenyon cells). Locusts can also impose odor intermittency through active sampling movements with their unrestrained antennae. Odors triggered immediate, spatially targeted antennal scanning that, paradoxically, weakened individual neural responses. However, these frequent but weaker responses were highly informative about stimulus location. Thus, not only are odor-elicited dynamic neural responses compatible with natural stimulus fluctuations and important for stimulus identification, but locusts actively increase intermittency, possibly to improve stimulus localization."

https://openalex.org/W2339719201,"SPROUTY-2 (SPRY2) is a modulator of tyrosine kinase receptor signaling with receptor- and cell type-dependent inhibitory or enhancing effects. Studies on the action of SPRY2 in major cancers are conflicting and its role remains unclear. Here we have dissected SPRY2 action in human colon cancer. Global transcriptomic analyses show that SPRY2 downregulates genes encoding tight junction proteins such as claudin-7 and occludin and other cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion molecules in human SW480-ADH colon carcinoma cells. Moreover, SPRY2 represses LLGL2/HUGL2, PATJ1/INADL and ST14, main regulators of the polarized epithelial phenotype, and ESRP1, an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inhibitor. A key action of SPRY2 is the upregulation of the major EMT inducer ZEB1, as these effects are reversed by ZEB1 knock-down by means of RNA interference. Consistently, we found an inverse correlation between the expression level of claudin-7 and those of SPRY2 and ZEB1 in human colon tumors. Mechanistically, ZEB1 upregulation by SPRY2 results from the combined induction of ETS1 transcription factor and the repression of microRNAs (miR-200 family, miR-150) that target ZEB1 RNA. Moreover, SPRY2 increased AKT activation by epidermal growth factor, whereas AKT and also Src inhibition reduced the induction of ZEB1. Altogether, these data suggest that AKT and Src are implicated in SPRY2 action. Collectively, these results show a tumorigenic role of SPRY2 in colon cancer that is based on the dysregulation of tight junction and epithelial polarity master genes via upregulation of ZEB1. The dissection of the mechanism of action of SPRY2 in colon cancer cells is important to understand the upregulation of this gene in a subset of patients with this neoplasia that have poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2255576927,"We recently reported that ZBTB7A is a bona fide transcription repressor of key glycolytic genes and its downregulation in human cancer contributes to tumor metabolism. As reduced expression of ZBTB7A is found only in a subset of human cancers, we explored alternative mechanisms of its inactivation by mining human cancer genome databases. We discovered recurrent somatic mutations of ZBTB7A in multiple types of human cancers with a marked enrichment of mutations within the zinc finger domain. Functional characterization of the mutants demonstrated that mutations within the zinc finger region of ZBTB7A invariably resulted in loss of function. As a consequence, the glycolytic genes were markedly upregulated in cancer cells harboring ZBTB7A zinc finger mutation, leading to increased glycolysis and proliferation. Our study uncovers the loss-of-function mutation in ZBTB7A as a novel mechanism causing elevated glycolysis in human cancer, which carries important therapeutic implication."
https://openalex.org/W2133727672,"Chromatin architecture determines transcriptional accessibility to DNA and consequently gene expression levels in response to developmental and environmental stimuli. Recently, chromatin remodelers such as SWI/SNF complexes have been recognized as key regulators of chromatin architecture. To gain insight into the function of these complexes during root development, we have analyzed Arabidopsis knock-down lines for one sub-unit of SWI/SNF complexes: BAF60. Here, we show that BAF60 is a positive regulator of root development and cell cycle progression in the root meristem via its ability to down-regulate cytokinin production. By opposing both the deposition of active histone marks and the formation of a chromatin regulatory loop, BAF60 negatively regulates two crucial target genes for cytokinin biosynthesis (IPT3 and IPT7) and one cell cycle inhibitor (KRP7). Our results demonstrate that SWI/SNF complexes containing BAF60 are key factors governing the equilibrium between formation and dissociation of a chromatin loop controlling phytohormone production and cell cycle progression."

Although this protein shows a very high homology with PABPs from other eukaryotic organisms including mammals and other parasites, exist divergences along the sequence that convert them in potential diagnostic markers and/or therapeutics targets. Aptamers are oligonucleotide ligands that are selected in vitro by their affinity and specificity for the target as a consequence of the particular tertiary structure that they are able to acquire depending on their sequence. Development of high-affinity molecules with the ability to recognize specifically Leishmania proteins is essential for the progress of this kind of study.We have selected a ssDNA aptamer population against a recombinant 6xHIS-LiPABP protein (rLiPABP) that is able to recognize the target with a low Kd. Cloning, sequencing and in silico analysis of the aptamers obtained from the population yielded three aptamers (ApPABP#3, ApPABP#7 and ApPABP#11) that significantly bound to PABP with higher affinity than the naïve population. These aptamers were analyzed by ELONA and slot blot to establish affinity and specificity for rLiPABP. Results demonstrated that the three aptamers have high affinity and specificity for the target and that they are able to detect an endogenous LiPABP (eLiPABP) protein amount corresponding to 2500 L. infantum promastigotes in a significant manner. The functional analysis of the aptamers also revealed that ApPABP#11 disrupts the binding of both Myc-LiPABP and eLiPABP to poly (A) in vitro. On the other hand, these aptamers are able to bind and purify LiPABP from complex mixes.Results presented here demonstrate that aptamers represent new reagents for characterization of LiPABP and that they can affect LiPABP activity. At this respect, the use of these aptamers as therapeutic tool affecting the physiological role of PABP has to be analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W2206900728,"Purpose To investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of wearable antioxidant glasses containing extracts of medicinal plants in patients with mild dry eye disease (DED). Methods Fifty patients with mild DED were randomly assigned to wear either extracts of antioxidant medicinal plants containing (N = 25) or placebo glasses (N = 25). Patients wore the glasses for 15 min three times daily. The ocular surface disease index (OSDI) score, tear film break up time (BUT), and Schirmer’s test were evaluated and compared within the group and between the groups at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after treatment. Results OSDI score and tear film BUT were significantly improved in the treatment group at 4 and 8 weeks after wearing glasses (all P < 0.001). Compared to the placebo group, the OSDI scores were significantly lower in the treatment group at 8 weeks (P = 0.007). The results of the Schirmer’s test showed significant improvement in the treatment group at 4 weeks (P = 0.035), however there were no significant differences between the other groups or within the groups. No adverse events were reported during the study. Conclusions Antioxidant glasses containing extracts of medicinal plants were effective in improving in DED both subjectively and objectively. Wearing antioxidants glasses might be a safe and adjunctive therapeutic option for DED. Trial Registration ISRCTN registry 71217488"
https://openalex.org/W1898867566,"L-asparaginase (ASP) is a key element in the treatment of paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). However, hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) to ASP are major challenges in paediatric patients. Our aim was to investigate genetic variants that may influence the risk to Escherichia coli-derived ASP hypersensitivity. Sample and clinical data collection was carried out from 576 paediatric ALL patients who were treated according to protocols from the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster Study Group. A total of 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GRIA1 and GALNT10 genes were genotyped. Patients with GRIA1 rs4958351 AA/AG genotype showed significantly reduced risk to ASP hypersensitivity compared to patients with GG genotype in the T-cell ALL subgroup (OR = 0.05 (0.01-0.26); p = 4.70E-04), while no such association was found in pre-B-cell ALL. In the medium risk group two SNPs of GRIA1 (rs2055083 and rs707176) were associated significantly with the occurrence of ASP hypersensitivity (OR = 0.21 (0.09-0.53); p = 8.48E-04 and OR = 3.02 (1.36-6.73); p = 6.76E-03, respectively). Evaluating the genders separately, however, the association of rs707176 with ASP HSRs was confined only to females. Our results suggest that genetic variants of GRIA1 might influence the risk to ASP hypersensitivity, but subgroups of patients can differ significantly in this respect."
https://openalex.org/W2195983836,"The importance of transmission of occult HBV infection (OBI) via transfusion, organ transplantation and hemodialysis has been widely recognized. However, data regarding the transmission of OBI through close contact remain limited. In this study, serum samples were obtained from a child and his parents. The child had received the standard vaccination regimen at birth and produced protective antibody. Sera were tested for HBV serological markers. Nested PCR assays were used to detect HBV DNA and the amplicons were cloned and their sequences subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The results showed that both parents had occult infections while the child had an overt infection. Twelve, eleven and nine clones, from the father, mother and son, respectively, were sequenced. Serotypes adrq+, ayw1, ayw and ayr were found in the father and ayw1, adw2 and adwq+ in the mother; adrq+ was the only serotype in son. Genotype B, subgenotype C2 and a recombinant were identified in the father and genotype B, subgenotype C5 and three recombinants were found in the mother. Subgenotype C2 was the only genotype identified in the child. A phylogenetic tree showed that all of the child's sequences and most of the father's sequences clustered together. However, none of mother's sequences clustered with those of the child. The surface gene from the child and his father had the same amino acid substitution pattern (T118K, T123N and G145A). We concluded that the father was the source of the son's HBV infection, suggesting that occult HBV infection may be transmitted through close contact and manifest as an overt infection."
https://openalex.org/W2258228646,"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) products from different pharmaceutical companies vary in composition, in part because of the selected blood donors and production process. N-glycosylation of the Fc-portion of IgG varies between blood donors and may influence both the side-effects and therapeutic effectiveness of IVIg. At present, the variation in Fc N-glycosylation between IVIg products has not been defined. Utilizing mass spectrometry, we performed relative quantitation of the Fc N-glycosylation of IgG, assessing a total of 154 unique lot numbers of IVIg. Seven products showed comparable Fc N-glycosylation, with only one product differing from the others in all glycosylation features (galactosylation, sialylation, fucosylation and bisecting N-acetylglucosamine). However, the mean difference did not exceed 3%. Within product variation was present to a minor degree, but largely indistinguishable from analytical variation. In conclusion, we expect that the minor variation in Fc N-glycosylation between IVIg products has a small effect, if any, on the biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W2304833851,"Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) has received a significant amount of attention as a medicinal plant and oilseed crop. Gene expression studies provide a theoretical molecular biology foundation for improving new traits and developing new cultivars. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) has become a crucial approach for gene expression analysis. In addition, appropriate reference genes (RGs) are essential for accurate and rapid relative quantification analysis of gene expression. In this study, fifteen candidate RGs involved in multiple metabolic pathways of plants were finally selected and validated under different experimental treatments, at different seed development stages and in different cultivars and tissues for real-time PCR experiments. These genes were ABCS, 60SRPL10, RANBP1, UBCL, MFC, UBCE2, EIF5A, COA, EF1-β, EF1, GAPDH, ATPS, MBF1, GTPB and GST. The suitability evaluation was executed by the geNorm and NormFinder programs. Overall, EF1, UBCE2, EIF5A, ATPS and 60SRPL10 were the most stable genes, and MBF1, as well as MFC, were the most unstable genes by geNorm and NormFinder software in all experimental samples. To verify the validation of RGs selected by the two programs, the expression analysis of 7 CtFAD2 genes in safflower seeds at different developmental stages under cold stress was executed using different RGs in RT-qPCR experiments for normalization. The results showed similar expression patterns when the most stable RGs selected by geNorm or NormFinder software were used. However, the differences were detected using the most unstable reference genes. The most stable combination of genes selected in this study will help to achieve more accurate and reliable results in a wide variety of samples in safflower."
https://openalex.org/W2268015594,"China is transitioning towards concentrating tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic and treatment services in hospitals, while the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) system will retain important public health functions. Patient expenditure incurred through hospitalization may lead to barriers to TB care or interruption of treatment.We conducted a national survey of TB specialized hospitals to determine hospitalization fees and hospital bed utilization in 1999, 2004, and 2009. Hospitalization of TB patients increased 185.3% from 1999 to 2009. While the average hospitalization fees also increased, the proportion of those fees in relation to GDP per capita decreased. Hospitalization fees differed across the three regions (eastern, central, and western). Using a least standard difference (LSD) paired analysis, in 2004, the difference in hospitalization fees was significant when comparing eastern and central provinces (p<0.001) as well as to western provinces (p<0.001). In 2009, the difference remained statistically significant when comparing eastern province hospitalization fees with central provinces (p<0.001) and western provinces (p = 0.008). In 2004 and 2009, the cost associated with hospitalization as a proportion of GDP per capita was highest in the western region. The average in-patient stay decreased from 33 days in 1999 to 26 and 27 days in 2004 and 2009 respectively. Finally, hospital bed utilization in all three regions increased over this period.Our findings show that both the total number of in-patients and hospitalization fees increased from 1999 to 2009, though the proportion of hospitalization fees to GDP per capita decreased. As diagnostic services move to hospitals, regulatory and monitoring mechanisms should be established, and hospitals should make use of the experience garnered by the CDC system through continued strong collaborations. Infrastructure and social protection mechanisms in high burden areas, such as in the western region, should be strengthened."
https://openalex.org/W1932974022,"The present study aimed at comparing frontal beta power between long-term (LTM) and first-time meditators (FTM), before, during and after a meditation session. We hypothesized that LTM would present lower beta power than FTM due to lower effort of attention and awareness.Twenty one participants were recruited, eleven of whom were long-term meditators. The subjects were asked to rest for 4 minutes before and after open monitoring (OM) meditation (40 minutes).The two-way ANOVA revealed an interaction between the group and moment factors for the Fp1 (p<0.01), F7 (p = 0.01), F3 (p<0.01), Fz (p<0.01), F4 (p<0.01), F8 (p<0.01) electrodes.We found low power frontal beta activity for LTM during the task and this may be associated with the fact that OM is related to bottom-up pathways that are not present in FTM.We hypothesized that the frontal beta power pattern may be a biomarker for LTM. It may also be related to improving an attentive state and to the efficiency of cognitive functions, as well as to the long-term experience with meditation (i.e., life-time experience and frequency of practice)."
https://openalex.org/W2201586828,"Epilepsy, one of the most common conditions affecting the brain, is characterized by neuroplasticity and brain cell energy defects. In this work, we demonstrate the ability of the Escherichia coli protein toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) to counteract epileptiform phenomena in inbred DBA/2J mice, an animal model displaying genetic background with an high susceptibility to induced- and spontaneous seizures. Via modulation of the Rho GTPases, CNF1 regulates actin dynamics with a consequent increase in spine density and length in pyramidal neurons of rat visual cortex, and influences the mitochondrial homeostasis with remarkable changes in the mitochondrial network architecture. In addition, CNF1 improves cognitive performances and increases ATP brain content in mouse models of Rett syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. The results herein reported show that a single dose of CNF1 induces a remarkable amelioration of the seizure phenotype, with a significant augmentation in neuroplasticity markers and in cortex mitochondrial ATP content. This latter effect is accompanied by a decrease in the expression of mitochondrial fission proteins, suggesting a role of mitochondrial dynamics in the CNF1-induced beneficial effects on this epileptiform phenotype. Our results strongly support the crucial role of brain energy homeostasis in the pathogenesis of certain neurological diseases, and suggest that CNF1 could represent a putative new therapeutic tool for epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2213288163,"A replenishable source of insulin-producing cells has the potential to cure type 1 diabetes. Attempts to culture and expand pancreatic β-cells in vitro have resulted in their transition from insulin-producing epithelial cells to mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) with high proliferative capacity but devoid of any hormone production. The aim of this study was to determine whether the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), could induce a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) of the cultured cells. Islet-enriched pancreatic cells, allowed to dedifferentiate and expand in adherent cell culture, were transduced with an adenovirus containing KLF4 (Ad-Klf4). Cells were subsequently analysed for changes in cell morphology by light microscopy, and for the presence of epithelial and pancreatic markers by immunocytochemistry and quantitative RT/PCR. Infection with Ad-Klf4 resulted in morphological changes, down-regulation of mesenchymal markers, and re-expression of both epithelial and pancreatic cell markers including insulin and transcription factors specific to β-cells. This effect was further enhanced by culturing cells in suspension. However, the effects of Ad-KLf4 were transient and this was shown to be due to increased apoptosis in Klf4-expressing cells. Klf4 has been recently identified as a pioneer factor with the ability to modulate the structure of chromatin and enhance reprogramming/transdifferentiation. Our results show that Klf4 may have a role in the redifferentiation of expanded pancreatic cells in culture, but before this can be achieved the off-target effects that result in increased apoptosis would need to be overcome."
https://openalex.org/W1908723967,"Background Tesamorelin, a synthetic analog of human growth hormone-releasing factor, decreases visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with lipodystrophy. Objectives 1) To evaluate the utility of patient characteristics and validated disease-risk scores, namely indicator variables for the metabolic syndrome defined by the International Diabetes Federation (MetS-IDF) or the National Cholesterol Education Program (MetS-NCEP) and the Framingham Risk Score (FRS), as predictors of VAT reduction during tesamorelin therapy at 3 and 6 months, and 2) To explore the characteristics of patients who reached a threshold of VAT <140 cm2, a level associated with lower risk of adverse health outcomes, after 6 months of treatment with tesamorelin. Methods Data were analyzed from two Phase 3 studies in which HIV-infected patients with excess abdominal fat were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive tesamorelin 2 mg (n = 543) or placebo (n = 263) subcutaneously daily for 6 months, using ANOVA and ANCOVA models. Results Metabolic syndrome (MetS-IDF or MetS-NCEP) and FRS were significantly associated with VAT at baseline. Presence of metabolic syndrome ([MetS-NCEP), triglyceride levels >1.7 mmol/L, and white race had a significant impact on likelihood of response to tesamorelin after 6 months of therapy (interaction p-values 0.054, 0.063, and 0.025, respectively). No predictive factors were identified at 3 months. The odds of a VAT reduction to <140 cm2 for subjects treated with tesamorelin was 3.9 times greater than that of subjects randomized to placebo after controlling for study, gender, baseline body mass index (BMI) and baseline VAT (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.03; 7.44). Conclusions Individuals with baseline MetS-NCEP, elevated triglyceride levels, or white race were most likely to experience reductions in VAT after 6 months of tesamorelin treatment. The odds of response of VAT <140 cm2 was 3.9 times greater for tesamorelin-treated patients than that of patients receiving placebo."
https://openalex.org/W2209100139,"The wealth of field studies using stable isotopes to make inferences about animal diets require controlled validation experiments to make proper interpretations. Despite several pleas in the literature for such experiments, validation studies are still lagging behind, notably in consumers dwelling in chemosynthesis-based ecosystems. In this paper we present such a validation experiment for the incorporation of 13C and 15N in the blood plasma of a medium-sized shorebird, the red knot (Calidris canutus canutus), consuming a chemosymbiotic lucinid bivalve (Loripes lucinalis). Because this bivalve forms a symbiosis with chemoautotrophic sulphide-oxidizing bacteria living inside its gill, the bivalve is isotopically distinct from ‘normal’ bivalves whose food has a photosynthetic basis. Here we experimentally tested the hypothesis that isotope discrimination and incorporation dynamics are different when consuming such chemosynthesis-based prey. The experiment showed that neither the isotopic discrimination factor, nor isotopic turnover time, differed between birds consuming the chemosymbiotic lucinid and a control group consuming a photosynthesis-based bivalve. This was true for 13C as well as for 15N. However, in both groups the 15N discrimination factor was much higher than expected, which probably had to do with the birds losing body mass over the course of the experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2143457754,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease that causes reduced visual acuity and blindness. The new treatment options for AMD are not provided by the Brazilian public health system.To conduct a budget impact analysis of three scenarios for the introduction of AMD treatments: all the medications (verteporfin, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab-the reference scenario), ranibizumab alone, and bevacizumab alone.The basic assumption was that the Brazilian public health system would treat the entire target population with AMD aged > 70 years between 2008 and 2011. The size of the population of interest was estimated from official population projections and the prevalence of the disease was obtained from a systematic review. Medication prices were estimated by weighting their market values with correction factors to take account of the public procurement policy. The possibility of aliquoting bevacizumab was also considered. A panel of experts was consulted to estimate the market share of the different medications for the reference scenario. The incremental costs of the ranibizumab-alone and bevacizumab-alone scenarios compared to the reference scenario were calculated. Univariate sensitivity analyses were run to check the robustness of the model.In four years, the Brazilian public health system would have treated 1,136,349 individuals with AMD. The annual costs of treating one patient would have been US$476.65 for bevacizumab, US$11,469.39 for ranibizumab, and US$4,376.28 for verteporfin. The incremental cost of the ranibizumab-alone scenario would have been US$1,878,318,056.00 in four years, while the incremental cost for the bevacizumab-alone scenario would have been a reduction of US$4,978,326,359.00 (i.e., a cost saving) in the same period. The bevacizumab-alone option was found to represent a cost saving across sensitivity analyses.The introduction of bevacizumab for the treatment of AMD is recommended for the Brazilian Public Health System."
https://openalex.org/W2206804198,"The peptide hormone gastrin binds two ferric ions with high affinity, and iron binding is essential for the biological activity of non-amidated forms of the hormone. Since gastrins act as growth factors in gastrointestinal cancers, and as peptides labelled with Ga and In isotopes are increasingly used for cancer diagnosis, the ability of gastrins to bind other metal ions was investigated systematically by absorption spectroscopy. The coordination structures of the complexes were characterized by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. Changes in the absorption of gastrin in the presence of increasing concentrations of Ga3+ were fitted by a 2 site model with dissociation constants (Kd) of 3.3 x 10−7 and 1.1 x 10−6 M. Although the absorption of gastrin did not change upon the addition of In3+ ions, the changes in absorbance on Fe3+ ion binding in the presence of indium ions were fitted by a 2 site model with Kd values for In3+ of 6.5 x 10−15 and 1.7 x 10−7 M. Similar results were obtained with Ru3+ ions, although the Kd values for Ru3+ of 2.6 x 10−13 and 1.2 x 10−5 M were slightly larger than observed for In3+. The structures determined by EXAFS all had metal:gastrin stoichiometries of 2:1 but, while the metal ions in the Fe, Ga and In complexes were bridged by a carboxylate and an oxygen with a metal-metal separation of 3.0–3.3 Å, the Ru complex clearly demonstrated a short range Ru—Ru separation, which was significantly shorter, at 2.4 Å, indicative of a metal-metal bond. We conclude that gastrin selectively binds two In3+ or Ru3+ ions, and that the affinity of the first site for In3+ or Ru3+ ions is higher than for ferric ions. Some of the metal ion-gastrin complexes may be useful for cancer diagnosis and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1865302071,"Motivation Genome-scale metabolic networks can be modeled in a constraint-based fashion. Reaction stoichiometry combined with flux capacity constraints determine the space of allowable reaction rates. This space is often large and a central challenge in metabolic modeling is finding the biologically most relevant flux distributions. A widely used method is flux balance analysis (FBA), which optimizes a biologically relevant objective such as growth or ATP production. Although FBA has proven to be highly useful for predicting growth and byproduct secretion, it cannot predict the intracellular fluxes under all environmental conditions. Therefore, alternative strategies have been developed to select flux distributions that are in agreement with experimental “omics” data, or by incorporating experimental flux measurements. The latter, unfortunately can only be applied to a limited set of reactions and is currently not feasible at the genome-scale. On the other hand, it has been observed that micro-organisms favor a suboptimal growth rate, possibly in exchange for a more “flexible” metabolic network. Instead of dedicating the internal network state to an optimal growth rate in one condition, a suboptimal growth rate is used, that allows for an easier switch to other nutrient sources. A small decrease in growth rate is exchanged for a relatively large gain in metabolic capability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Results Here, we propose Maximum Metabolic Flexibility (MMF) a computational method that utilizes this observation to find the most probable intracellular flux distributions. By mapping measured flux data from central metabolism to the genome-scale models of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae we show that i) indeed, most of the measured fluxes agree with a high adaptability of the network, ii) this result can be used to further reduce the space of feasible solutions iii) this reduced space improves the quantitative predictions made by FBA and contains a significantly larger fraction of the measured fluxes compared to the flux space that was reduced by a uniform sampling approach and iv) MMF can be used to select reactions in the network that contribute most to the steady-state flux space. Constraining the selected reactions improves the quantitative predictions of FBA considerably more than adding an equal amount of flux constraints, selected using a more naïve approach. Our method can be applied to any cell type without requiring prior information. Availability MMF is freely available as a MATLAB plugin at: http://cs.ru.nl/~wmegchel/mmf."

All participants had received a primary MenCC vaccination nine years earlier.The number of circulating MenC-specific IgG memory B cells prior to booster was low and not predictive for MenC-specific IgG responses in serum or saliva post-booster, whereas the number of MenC-specific IgA memory B cells pre-booster positively correlated with MenC-specific IgA levels in saliva post-booster (R = 0.5, P<0.05). The booster induced a clear increase in the number of MenC-specific IgG and IgA memory B cells. The number of MenC-PS-specific IgG memory B cells at 1 month post-booster was highest in the 12-year-olds. The number of MenC-specific memory B cells at one month post-booster showed no correlation with the rate of MenC-specific antibody decay throughout the first year post-booster.Circulating MenC-specific IgA memory B cells correlate with IgA responses in saliva, whereas circulating MenC-specific IgG memory B cells are not predictive for MenC-specific IgG responses in serum or saliva.

https://openalex.org/W2215360662,"The dynamics of the Min-protein system help Escherichia coli regulate the process of cell division by identifying the center of the cell. While this system exhibits robust bipolar oscillations in wild-type cell shapes, recent experiments have shown that when the cells are mechanically deformed into wide, flattened out, irregular shapes, the spatial regularity of these oscillations breaks down. We employ widely used stochastic and deterministic models of the Min system to simulate cells with flattened shapes. The deterministic model predicts strong bipolar oscillations, in contradiction with the experimentally observed behavior, while the stochastic model, which is based on the same reaction-diffusion equations, predicts more spatially irregular oscillations. We further report simulations of flattened but more symmetric shapes, which suggest that the flattening and lateral expansion may contribute as much to the irregular oscillation behavior as the asymmetry of the cell shapes."
