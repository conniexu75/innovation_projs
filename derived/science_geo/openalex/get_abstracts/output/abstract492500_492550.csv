https://openalex.org/W1994875855,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a recently recognized group of lymphocytes that have important functions in protecting epithelial barriers against infections and in maintaining organ homeostasis. ILCs have been categorized into three distinct groups, transcriptional circuitry and effector functions of which strikingly resemble the various T helper cell subsets. Here, we identify a common, Id2-expressing progenitor to all interleukin 7 receptor-expressing, ""helper-like"" ILC lineages, the CHILP. Interestingly, the CHILP differentiated into ILC2 and ILC3 lineages, but not into conventional natural killer (cNK) cells that have been considered an ILC1 subset. Instead, the CHILP gave rise to a peculiar NKp46(+) IL-7Rα(+) ILC lineage that required T-bet for specification and was distinct of cNK cells or other ILC lineages. Such ILC1s coproduced high levels of IFN-γ and TNF and protected against infections with the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Our data significantly advance our understanding of ILC differentiation and presents evidence for a new ILC lineage that protects barrier surfaces against intracellular infections."

Inspired by recent work on double-network hydrogels, Ducrot et al. (p. 186 ; see the Perspective by Gong ) designed interpenetrated network elastomers that contained isotropically prestretched chains as the first network. Double- and triple-network structures yielded elastomers with very high strength and toughness in comparison with the corresponding single networks."
https://openalex.org/W1511851223,"Hidden states of matter with novel and unusual properties may be created if a system out of equilibrium can be induced to follow a trajectory to a state which is inaccessible or does not even exist under normal equilibrium conditions. Here we report on the discovery of a hidden (H) topologically protected electronic state in a layered dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2 crystal reached as a result of a quench caused by a single 35 fs laser pulse. The properties of the H state are markedly different from any other state of the system: it exhibits a large drop of electrical resistance, strongly modified single particle and collective mode spectra and a marked change of optical reflectivity. Particularly important and unusual, the H state is stable for an arbitrarily long time until a laser pulse, electrical current or thermal erase procedure is applied, causing it to revert to the thermodynamic ground state. Major observed events can be reproduced by a kinetic model describing the conversion of photo excited electrons and holes into an electronically ordered crystal, thus converting a Mott insulator to a conducting H state. Its long-time stability follows from the topological protection of the number of periods in the electronic crystal."
https://openalex.org/W1967359088,"TCR-pMHC interactions initiate adaptive immune responses, but the mechanism of how such interactions under force induce T cell signaling is unclear. We show that force prolongs lifetimes of single TCR-pMHC bonds for agonists (catch bonds) but shortens those for antagonists (slip bonds). Both magnitude and duration of force are important, as the highest Ca(2+) responses were induced by 10 pN via both pMHC catch bonds whose lifetime peaks at this force and anti-TCR slip bonds whose maximum lifetime occurs at 0 pN. High Ca(2+) levels require early and rapid accumulation of bond lifetimes, whereas short-lived bonds that slow early accumulation of lifetimes correspond to low Ca(2+) responses. Our data support a model in which force on the TCR induces signaling events depending on its magnitude, duration, frequency, and timing, such that agonists form catch bonds that trigger the T cell digitally, whereas antagonists form slip bonds that fail to activate."
https://openalex.org/W2076968934,"Maintenance of a constant cell volume in response to extracellular or intracellular osmotic changes is critical for cellular homeostasis. Activation of a ubiquitous volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) plays a key role in this process; however, its molecular identity in vertebrates remains unknown. Here, we used a cell-based fluorescence assay and performed a genome-wide RNAi screen to find components of VRAC. We identified SWELL1 (LRRC8A), a member of a four-transmembrane protein family with unknown function, as essential for hypotonicity-induced iodide influx. SWELL1 is localized to the plasma membrane, and its knockdown dramatically reduces endogenous VRAC currents and regulatory cell volume decrease in various cell types. Furthermore, point mutations in SWELL1 cause a significant change in VRAC anion selectivity, demonstrating that SWELL1 is an essential VRAC component. These findings enable further molecular characterization of the VRAC channel complex and genetic studies for understanding the function of VRAC in normal physiology and disease."

Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene represent the most common genetic lesions in cancer (Freed-Pastor and Prives, 2012Freed-Pastor W.A. Prives C. Mutant p53: one name, many proteins.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 1268-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Functional studies indicate that wild-type p53 possesses a series of antiproliferative activities that limit the proliferation and survival of premalignant cells. p53 exerts these activities, at least in part, through its ability to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner to regulate gene expression, and the vast majority of mutations that occur in human tumors disable this property of p53 and, consequently, its antiproliferative effects. p53 mutations typically occur within the DNA-binding region and involve either DNA contact residues or residues important for conformational structure, both resulting in loss of DNA binding (Joerger and Fersht, 2007Joerger A.C. Fersht A.R. Structural biology of the tumor suppressor p53 and cancer-associated mutants.Adv. Cancer Res. 2007; 97: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because p53 functions as a tetrameric transcription factor, mono-allelic p53 mutations can exert dominant-negative effects on a coexpressed wild-type p53 protein. p53 activates E3 ubiquitin ligases that feed back to trigger p53 destruction and its rapid turnover; however, p53 missense mutants defective in regulating gene expression lead to the stable accumulation of the variant proteins (Oren and Rotter, 2010Oren M. Rotter V. Mutant p53 gain-of-function in cancer.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2 (a001107)Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Interestingly, genetically engineered mice harboring common p53 point mutations develop more aggressive and metastatic tumors compared to those arising in their p53 heterozygous or null counterparts (Lang et al., 2004Lang G.A.

Accordingly, human tumors with mutant p53 are associated with poor patient prognosis (Soussi and Béroud, 2001Soussi T. Béroud C.

Recently, targeting mutant p53 function has been proposed as an antimetastatic measure. As p53 mutant proteins have to date proved undruggable (Levine and Oren, 2009Levine A.J. Oren M.

Such efforts have identified proteins involved in integrin recycling (Muller et al., 2009Muller P.A. Caswell P.T. Doyle B. Iwanicki M.P. Tan E.H. Karim S. Lukashchuk N. Gillespie D.A. Ludwig R.L.

So far, most studies have been performed in breast cancer, and the proposed mechanisms do not necessarily validate across cancer types. These observations underscore the importance of the cellular context in assessing mutant p53 action and highlight the potential complexity of the effector network. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one cancer type in which mutant p53 impacts disease progression. PDAC arises from indolent pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) that frequently go undetected and persist for many years. However, the conversion of PanINs to highly aggressive, frankly invasive and metastatic PDACs, in which p53 is mutated in 75% of cases, carries a dire prognosis because of late-stage detection, the presence of metastases, and ineffective treatment options (Li et al., 2004Li D. Xie K. Wolff R. Abbruzzese J.L. Pancreatic cancer.Lancet. 2004; 363: 1049-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). Even those patients with a surgically approachable pancreatic lesion develop recurrent and metastatic disease after local tumor resection (Hidalgo, 2010Hidalgo M. Pancreatic cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 362: 1605-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for mutant p53 in this process, mice harboring pancreatic cancers driven by oncogenic Kras and a mutant p53 allele show more metastases compared to identical mice harboring a p53 null allele (Morton et al., 2010Morton J.P. Timpson P. Karim S.A. Ridgway R.A. Athineos D. Doyle B. Jamieson N.B. Oien K.A. Lowy A.M. Brunton V.G. et al.Mutant p53 drives metastasis and overcomes growth arrest/senescence in pancreatic cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether mutant p53 is needed to sustain the metastatic phenotype and how it is regulated. Such information would produce insights into p53 action and validate mutant p53 as a therapeutic target. In this study, we combined several orthogonal approaches and models to systematically explore the molecular basis whereby mutant p53 promotes invasion and metastasis in PDAC and the clinical implications of its effects. These studies identified the platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRb) as necessary and sufficient to mediate the effects of mutant p53 on invasion and metastasis in both a murine model and human PDAC cells. Further, we identified elevated PDGFRb expression as an indicator of poor metastasis-free survival in human PDAC patients. Taken together, our data identify a key mediator of mutant p53 activity and suggest that PDGFRb inhibitors may act as antimetastatic agents in some patients with tumors expressing mutant p53. Genetically engineered mouse models of pancreatic cancer harboring a latent oncogenic Kras allele (lox-stop-lox KrasG12D), a latent mutant p53R172H, and a tissue-specific Cre recombinase (Pdx1-Cre), also known as KPC mice, develop highly metastatic pancreatic cancer that faithfully mimics the human disease (Hingorani et al., 2005Hingorani S.R. Wang L. Multani A.S. Combs C. Deramaudt T.B. Hruban R.H. Rustgi A.K. Chang S. Tuveson D.A. Trp53R172H and KrasG12D cooperate to promote chromosomal instability and widely metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in mice.Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 469-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). To understand the impact of p53 mutations on cell invasion and metastasis in this well-defined genetic system, we employed a murine KPC pancreatic cancer cell line that lost the remaining p53 wild-type allele during disease progression (Morton et al., 2010Morton J.P. Timpson P. Karim S.A. Ridgway R.A. Athineos D. Doyle B. Jamieson N.B. Oien K.A. Lowy A.M. Brunton V.G. et al.Mutant p53 drives metastasis and overcomes growth arrest/senescence in pancreatic cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The behavior of KPC cell lines stably expressing small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting (mutant) p53, or control shRNAs targeting Renilla (KPC+sh.Ctrl), were compared to one another and to a p53 null KPflC cell line (from a Pdx-Cre, LSL-KrasG12D/+, LSL-p53loxP/+) expressing the control shRNA (KPflC+sh.Ctrl). We confirmed that KPC+sh.Ctrl cells expressing mutant p53 efficiently migrated in scratch-wound assays. This motility depended on mutant p53, as mutant p53 knockdown in KPC+sh.p53 cells reduced motility similarly to p53−/− KPflC+sh.Ctrl cells (Figure 1A). Next, we examined the invasive capacity of KPC cells into collagen gels in an inverted invasion assay. The presence of mutant p53 in KPC+sh.Ctrl cells enhanced invasiveness, which was significantly abrogated upon p53 knockdown (Figure 1B). The ability of mutant p53 to drive cell invasion was also evident following enforced expression of p53R175H and p53R273H, two mutants frequently found in human PDAC, in KPflC cells. This result indicates that the differences in invasiveness of KPC and KPflC cells depend on mutant p53 and were not acquired during generation and selection of cell populations expressing shRNAs or through RNAi off-target effects. To test whether mutant p53 expression was required to sustain the metastatic potential of KPC cells, we orthotopically injected KPC+sh.Ctrl and KPC+sh.p53 cells into the pancreata of athymic mice and scored the number of metastases formed in both lung and liver, the most common sites of pancreatic cancer spread in patients. Although the primary tumor burden was independent of p53 status, tumors originating from KPC+sh.Ctrl cells expressing mutant p53 were significantly more metastatic than those in which mutant p53 was silenced, and metastases in the lung and liver were detected to a greater extent in mice that had been injected with cells expressing mutant p53 (Figure 1C). Together, these results demonstrate that mutant p53 can contribute to PDAC invasion and metastasis and that inhibiting its activity can have an antimetastatic effect. To gain insight into how mutant p53 mediates the invasive phenotype of PDAC, we performed genome-wide transcriptome profiling of KPC cells by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Four days following knockdown of mutant p53 in three independent clonal KPC populations, we observed a complex pattern of gene expression changes compared to three independent KPC+sh.Ctrl cell lines. We identified 441 genes either significantly up- or downregulated upon shRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous mutant p53 (Figure 2A; Figure S1A available online). Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that ∼20% of the affected genes fall into the functional class of “cellular movement,” supporting our experimental observations that mutant p53 can govern the invasive phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells (Figures 2B and S1C).Figure S1Knockdown of Mutant p53 in Pancreatic Cancer Cells Alters a Myriad of Genes and Pathways, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Heatmap of significantly changed genes (padj < 0.05) following mutant p53 depletion, as identified by RNA sequencing.

Data was analyzed through the use of ingenuity pathway analysis. To facilitate the identification of mediators of mutant p53 activity, we focused on genes whose expression was positively regulated by mutant p53, as such molecules might both mediate effects of mutant p53 and be targets for pharmacological inhibition. Therefore, we generated pools of 3–6 shRNAs targeting individual upregulated genes, and we screened them one-by-one to identify those that phenocopied the decreased invasion seen upon downregulation of mutant p53 (Table S1). We identified three genes whose knockdown abrogated invasion driven by mutant p53 (Figure 2C). SLC40A1 is a cell membrane protein that has been shown to mediate cellular iron efflux (Montalbetti et al., 2013Montalbetti N. Simonin A. Kovacs G.

Heuchel R.L. 3D pancreatic carcinoma spheroids induce a matrix-rich, chemoresistant phenotype offering a better model for drug testing.BMC Cancer. 2013; 13: 95Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar); and PDGFRb is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates PDGF-regulated proliferation, survival, and chemotaxis (Dai, 2010Dai Y. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors: a review of the recent patent literature.Expert Opin. Ther. Pat. 2010; 20: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Oncogenic properties of mutated or amplified PDGFRa have been extensively studied in several tumor types, whereas PDGFRb has been exclusively linked to tumor angiogenesis via paracrine effects (Pietras et al., 2003Pietras K. Sjöblom T. Rubin K. Heldin C.H. Ostman A. PDGF receptors as cancer drug targets.Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 439-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, Cao et al., 2004Cao R. Björndahl M.A. Religa P. Clasper S.

Dissing S. et al.PDGF-BB induces intratumoral lymphangiogenesis and promotes lymphatic metastasis.Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 333-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Based on our screening results, we hypothesized that PDGFRb may also have a cell-autonomous impact on cell invasion in pancreatic cancer. First, we verified by qRT-PCR and western blotting that PDGFRb mRNA and protein were reduced upon knockdown of mutant p53 (Figures 2D and 2E). Expression of mutant p53 correlated with high PDGFRb expression levels and also with the expression of key downstream mediators of the PDGFRb signaling cascade (Figure S1B). We next examined the effects of depleting each PDGFR isoform on the invasive potential of KPC cells in vitro (Figure 3A). Although knockdown of PDGFRa had no effect, depletion of PDGFRb decreased the ability of KPC cells to invade (Figure 3B). Conversely, overexpression of PDGFRb in p53−/− KPflC enhanced cell migration and invasion, similarly to cells overexpressing mutant forms of p53 (Figure S2A). Reduced levels of PDGFRb in KPC cells neither altered the rate of cell proliferation (Figure S2B) nor led to a competitive proliferative disadvantage over KPC cells expressing high PDGFRb levels (Figure S2C). When GFP-positive KPC+sh.PDGFRb cells were mixed with dsRED-positive KPC+sh.Ctrl cells and injected subcutaneously into athymic mice, the GFP:dsRED ratio of pre-injected cells was maintained in the established tumors, indicating that increased PDGFRb levels did not confer a selective advantage to tumor cell proliferation at the site of injection (Figure S2D). Thus, cell-autonomous activity of PDGFRb is not required for the proliferation and tumorigenic potential of p53 mutant murine cancer cells but specifically impacts their invasive potential.Figure S2PDGFRb Expression Levels Depend on p53 Status and Determine the Invasive Ability of Murine and Human Cancer Cells without Affecting Cell Proliferation, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Western blotting analysis of PDGFRb, p53, and actin from KPflC cells stably expressing a GFP-, p53R175H-, p53R273H-, or PDGFRb-cDNA vector (upper panel).

To determine if the mutant p53-PDGFRb signaling axis acts in human cancer cells, we analyzed PDGFRb expression levels in a panel of human pancreatic cancer cell lines. As in our model, PDGFRb mRNA levels were significantly higher in cells expressing mutant p53 compared to those in cell lines that maintained or lost the wild-type p53 allele (Figure 3C). Furthermore, knockdown of mutant p53 in Miapaca2, BXPC3, CFPAC, and A2.1 cell lines (carrying the 248W, 220C, 242R, and 155P alleles, respectively) decreased PDGFRb mRNA levels to varying degrees (Figure 3D). Knockdown of mutant p53 also decreased PDGFRb expression in several human colon (SW620, p53273H/P309S), lung (H1975, p53273H), and breast (MDA-MB-231, p53280K) cancer cell lines (Figure S2E). Thus, the ability of mutant p53 to induce PDGFRb levels is not strictly confined to a particular p53 allele or tumor type. We further analyzed the functional connection between mutant p53 and PDGFRb in promoting the invasiveness of human PDAC lines. Consistent with our studies in mouse PDAC lines, knockdown of either mutant p53 or PDGFRb reduced invasiveness of the A2.1 pancreatic cancer cell line (Figure 3E). Conversely, overexpression of PDGFRb in the human p53−/− ASPC pancreatic cancer cell line enhanced invasion compared to cells infected with a GFP control vector (Figure S2F). Collectively, these results confirm that upregulation of the PDGFRb receptor is important for the action of mutant p53 in PDAC and possibly other tumor types. Several pro-oncogenic properties of mutant p53 depend on its ability to physically interact with and inhibit the p53 family members, p63 and p73 (Li and Prives, 2007Li Y. Prives C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 39769-39776Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and because our KPC cells expressed p73, but not p63, as determined by RNA-seq (data not shown), we aimed to understand whether the physical interaction of mutant p53 with p73 might impair the ability of p73 to negatively regulate the expression of PDGFRb. First, we verified the interaction between p73 and mutant p53 proteins by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation (Figure 4A), and, consistent with previous reports, p73 binding to a “conformation” p53 mutant (R175H) appeared stronger than to a “DNA-binding” p53 mutant (R273H) (Gaiddon et al., 2001Gaiddon C.

Next, using a luciferase reporter driven from the PDGFRB promoter, we confirmed that overexpression of p73 in KPflC cells decreased transcriptional activity of PDGFRB and, conversely, that knockdown of endogenous p73 increased luciferase expression (Figures 4C and S3A). We also observed a similar increase in luciferase signal upon overexpression of two distinct forms of mutant p53 in KPflC cells (Figure 4C) as well as a significant decrease upon depletion of mutant p53 or overexpression of p73 in KPC cells (Figure S3C). Importantly, depletion of endogenous p73 in KPC cells expressing mutant p53 did not enhance the transcription of PDGFRB (Figure S3C), indicating that the repressing activity of p73 is regulated by its interaction with mutant p53. Hence, mutant p53 cancels the ability of p73 to repress PDGFRb transcription, leading to an increase in its expression.Figure S3Mutant p53 Drives PDGFRB Transcription by Opposing the Repressive Function of the p73/NF-Y Complex, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) qRT-PCR for p73 in KPC+sh.p73 (1 or 2) or +sh.Ctrl cells.

Identification of substitutions that are essential for airborne transmission of avian influenza viruses between ferrets and their associated phenotypes advances our fundamental understanding of virus transmission and will increase the value of future surveillance programs and public health risk assessments. Since the first detection in the late 1990s (Claas et al., 1998Claas E.C. Osterhaus A.D. van Beek R. De Jong J.C. Rimmelzwaan G.F. Senne D.A. Krauss S. Shortridge K.F. Webster R.G. Human influenza A H5N1 virus related to a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.Lancet. 1998; 351: 472-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/H5N1 viruses continue to circulate in poultry in Asia and the Middle East. Hundreds of millions of domestic birds have died as a result of infection and during culling activities to control the spread of the A/H5N1 virus. Occasional cross-species transmission events have been reported for several species of wild birds, pigs, felids, dogs, and mustelids. To date, 650 laboratory-confirmed cases of A/H5N1 virus infection in humans have been reported to the World Health Organization from 16 countries, of which ∼60% had fatal outcome. Sustained human-to-human transmission has not yet been described. However, the enzootic nature of A/H5N1 virus, its broad host range, the large number of infected hosts, and the observed accumulation of mammalian adaptive substitutions in the virus could potentially increase the risk of a future A/H5N1 virus pandemic. For 15 years, one of the key questions for pandemic preparedness has been whether the A/H5N1 virus might acquire the ability to transmit via aerosols or respiratory droplets (“airborne transmission”) among humans, a trait necessary for the virus to become pandemic. It was recently shown that a fully avian A/H5N1 virus can become airborne transmissible between ferrets (Herfst et al., 2012Herfst S. Schrauwen E.J. Linster M. Chutinimitkul S. de Wit E. Munster V.J.

Three other groups demonstrated that reassortant viruses between A/H5N1 and 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 viruses that contain the H5 hemagglutinin (HA) were also transmitted between ferrets or guinea pigs via the airborne route (Chen et al., 2012Chen L.M.

USA. 2009; 106: 3366-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, two substitutions were introduced in the receptor binding site (RBS) of HA that are known to switch receptor specificity from “avian” α2,3-linked sialic acids (α2,3-SA) to “human” α2,6-SA (Matrosovich et al., 2000Matrosovich M. Tuzikov A. Bovin N. Gambaryan A. Klimov A. Castrucci M.R. Donatelli I. Kawaoka Y.

Virol. 2000; 74: 8502-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), glutamine to leucine at position 222, and glycine to serine at position 224 (Q222L, G224S in H5 HA numbering). These three substitutions or other polymerase and RBS mutations with similar phenotypes were found in all pandemic influenza viruses of the last century and were therefore postulated to represent minimal requirements for adaptation of animal influenza viruses to humans to yield pandemic strains (Chutinimitkul et al., 2010aChutinimitkul S. van Riel D. Munster V.J. van den Brand J.M. Rimmelzwaan G.F. Kuiken T. Osterhaus A.D. Fouchier R.A. de Wit E.

Predicting ‘airborne’ influenza viruses: (trans-) mission impossible?.Curr. Opin. Virol. 2011; 1: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This “triple mutant” virus was passaged ten times in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets to yield mutant A/H5N1 viruses that were able to transmit via the airborne route between ferrets. In addition to the three substitutions introduced by reverse genetics, two substitutions in HA (H103Y and T156A) were consistently found in all transmitted A/H5N1 viruses. However, all airborne-transmitted viruses had accumulated additional substitutions. The transmissible virus with the lowest number of amino acid substitutions compared to the A/H5N1 wild-type virus had a total of nine substitutions. Here, we describe the identification of a minimal set of substitutions required for airborne transmission of influenza virus A/Indonesia/5/05 between ferrets and provide a detailed characterization of the phenotypic changes caused by each of these substitutions. We show that the substitutions acquired upon ferret passage of the triple mutant A/Indonesia/5/05 virus emerged rapidly, which is suggestive for strong natural selection. The identification of previously unrecognized substitutions and phenotypic traits responsible for influenza virus transmission is key to increasing our fundamental understanding of airborne spread of influenza virus and may ultimately increase prognostic capabilities and diagnostic value of surveillance studies necessary for pandemic preparedness. To define a minimal number of substitutions in A/Indonesia/5/05 that confer airborne transmission between ferrets, transmission experiments were performed as described previously (Munster et al., 2009Munster V.J. de Wit E. van den Brand J.M. Herfst S. Schrauwen E.J. Bestebroer T.M. van de Vijver D. Boucher C.A. Koopmans M. Rimmelzwaan G.F. et al.Pathogenesis and transmission of swine-origin 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus in ferrets.Science. 2009; 325: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). First, a recombinant virus was produced based on the consensus sequence of a previously identified virus that was airborne transmissible and that contained the lowest number of substitutions (n = 9) compared to the wild-type virus (PB2-E627K, PB1-H99Y, and PB1-I368V; HA-H103Y, HA-T156A, HA-Q222L, and HA-G224S; and NP-R99K and NP-S345N; Herfst et al., 2012Herfst S. Schrauwen E.J. Linster M. Chutinimitkul S. de Wit E. Munster V.J. Sorrell E.M. Bestebroer T.M. Burke D.F. Smith D.J. et al.Airborne transmission of influenza A/H5N1 virus between ferrets.Science. 2012; 336: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). This virus was transmitted to two out of two recipient ferrets, thus reproducing with a recombinant clonal virus our earlier results with a virus isolate (Figure 1A, V1). Next, we omitted either the two substitutions in nucleoprotein (NP) (V2) or the two substitutions in PB1 (V3). Whereas the recombinant virus missing two substitutions in NP was transmitted to two out of two animals, the virus missing two substitutions in PB1 was not transmitted (Figure 1A, V2 and V3). To investigate this further, the two substitutions in PB1 (H99Y and I368V) were tested individually. The virus harboring I368V in addition to the set of five substitutions consistently found in the airborne transmitted viruses (PB2-E627K, HA-H103Y, HA-T156A, HA-Q222L, HA-G224S) was not transmitted to recipient ferrets (Figure 1A, V4), whereas the addition of PB1-H99Y yielded a recombinant virus that was detected in three out of four exposed ferrets (Figure 1A, V5). Starting with virus V5 that had six substitutions compared to wild-type A/Indonesia/5/05 (HA-Q222L, HA-G224S, HA-H103Y, HA-T156A, PB2-E627K, and PB1-H99Y), all individual substitutions were omitted one by one (V7–V12). Viruses lacking either the receptor-binding substitution HA-G224S or HA-Q222L were detected in one and two out of four naive ferrets, respectively, upon exposure to inoculated ferrets (Figure 1B, V7 and V8). In contrast, when both HA-Q222L and HA-G224S were omitted, the virus was not transmitted between ferrets (Figure 1B, V6). Viruses lacking HA-T156A, HA-H103Y, PB1-H99Y, or PB2-E627K were not detected in recipient ferrets upon exposure either (Figure 1B, V9–V12). From this set of experiments, we conclude that PB2-E627K, PB1-H99Y, HA-H103Y, HA-T156A, and either HA-Q222L or HA-G224S in HA represent minimal sets of substitutions required for airborne transmission of A/Indonesia/5/05 between ferrets. Individual virus titers of nose and throat samples obtained from all donor-recipient pairs are shown in Figure S1 (available online). We next determined at which passage substitutions H99Y in PB1 and H103Y and T156A in HA emerged during the ten repeated passages of the triple mutant A/Indonesia/5/05. To this end, primers were designed to amplify virus genome fragments covering these amino acid positions, and RT-PCR was performed on RNA isolated from nasal turbinates, lungs, and nasal swabs or washes collected from the ferrets after each passage. Amplicons were sequenced using the Roche 454 GS Junior platform. PB1-99Y was already detected as a minor variant in the nasal turbinates in passage 1 and increased during subsequent passages to become the dominant variant in all tissues from passage 7 onward (Figure 2). HA-103Y was first detected in the nasal swabs of passage 2, was detected again in passages 5 and 6, and became the major variant from passage 7 onward. Of note, nasal washes instead of nasal turbinates were used to inoculate the ferrets from passage 6 onward, which may have contributed to rapid increase in the proportion of mutants containing HA-103Y after passage 7 (and perhaps also PB1-99Y). HA-156A was detected as a minor variant in passage 1 to rapidly become the dominant variant from passage 3 onward. Thus, the three substitutions that emerged during ferret passage and that contributed to aerosol transmissibility of A/H5N1 virus arose as early as after one or two passages and became dominant by passage 7. We next compared the full genome sequences of viruses described in Herfst et al., 2012Herfst S. Schrauwen E.J. Linster M. Chutinimitkul S. de Wit E. Munster V.J. Sorrell E.M. Bestebroer T.M. Burke D.F. Smith D.J. et al.Airborne transmission of influenza A/H5N1 virus between ferrets.Science. 2012; 336: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar present in passage 4, 8, and 10 nasal turbinates of ferrets inoculated with A/H5N1wild-type or A/H5N1HA Q222L, G224S PB2 E627K (Table S1). These samples were selected because they contained high copy numbers of viral RNA as determined by real-time PCR. Substitutions PB2-T23P, PA-T363P, PA-P211T, PA-L498F, NP-G462E, and NA-E239G emerged upon passage with both A/H5N1wild-type and A/H5N1HA Q222L, G224S PB2 E627K but did not become dominant variants. In contrast, T156A became a major variant upon passage of both viruses. Thus, whereas substitutions H99Y in PB1 and H103Y in HA emerged only upon passage of A/H5N1HA Q222L, G224S PB2 E627K, HA-T156A emergence was independent of PB2-E627K, HA-Q222L, and HA-G224S, which were introduced by reverse genetics. The latter three substitutions remained dominant (>96.2%) throughout all passages tested and were not detected throughout passage of A/H5N1wild-type (Table S1). To study the effect of airborne transmission on the viral intrahost nucleotide sequence variation, we compared the full virus genome sequences present in nasal wash samples of ferrets inoculated with A/H5N1HA Q222L, G224S PB2 E627K after ten passages in ferrets to nose swab samples of ferrets after two consecutive airborne transmission events (ferrets F5 and F6, Table S2). The number of nucleotide variations present in specimens from F5 (n = 12) and F6 (n = 16) was substantially less as compared to those in the passage 10 nasal wash sample (n = 28). Moreover, substitution PB1-99Y increased in frequency from 44.9% in passage 10 nasal wash to 100% and 73.3% in F5 and F6 after the two consecutive airborne transmission events. Similarly, HA-103Y increased from 87.6% to 100% and 100%, and HA-156A increased from 89.9% to 99% and 98.8%. These collective data are indicative of a strong selection bottleneck occurring on intrahost nucleotide sequence variation. To study the impact of the HA substitutions associated with airborne transmission on receptor preference, the attachment patterns of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) viruses harboring wild-type or mutant A/H5N1 HA proteins were first characterized using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections of ferret and human nasal turbinates, known to express “human-like” α2,6-SA receptors abundantly. PR8 virus with the wild-type H5 HA did not attach to nasal turbinate sections, whereas the same virus with a control human H3 HA showed abundant attachment, as expected (Figure 3A). Introduction of Q222L and G224S in wild-type H5 HA resulted in abundant virus attachment to the nasal turbinate sections, comparable to the H3 HA control, as shown previously (Chutinimitkul et al., 2010aChutinimitkul S. van Riel D. Munster V.J. van den Brand J.M. Rimmelzwaan G.F. Kuiken T. Osterhaus A.D. Fouchier R.A. de Wit E. In vitro assessment of attachment pattern and replication efficiency of H5N1 influenza A viruses with altered receptor specificity.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 6825-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Introduction of H103Y and T156A in either the wild-type H5 HA or HA Q222L, G224S did not result in obvious changes in these patterns of virus attachment. The attachment patterns of HAs to the ferret and human nasal turbinate tissue sections were indistinguishable. We used two solid-phase enzyme-linked receptor-binding assays to determine HA binding of virus immobilized on a 96-well plate to receptor analogs in solution: a direct binding assay and a binding inhibition assay (Matrosovich and Gambaryan, 2012Matrosovich M.N. Gambaryan A.S. Solid-phase assays of receptor-binding specificity.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 865: 71-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PR8 viruses that harbor wild-type or mutant H5 HAs were tested in direct binding assays with receptor analogs 3′-fetuin and 6′-fetuin (Figure 3B). Introduction of the Q222L and G224S in HAwild-type resulted in a switch in receptor binding specificity from α2,3-SA to α2,6-SA as expected, with no residual α2,3-SA binding. Introduction of H103Y and T156A in HAQ222L, G224S resulted in increased binding to α2,6-SA receptors but also low binding to α2,3-SA. Introduction of H103Y and T156A in HAwild-type resulted in increased binding to α2,3-SA and low binding to α2,6-SA. Thus, in both the context of HAwild-type and HAQ222L, G224S, substitutions H103Y and T156A resulted in increased binding avidity and limited dual receptor specificity. A direct binding assay performed with 3′-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine- and 6′-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine-containing synthetic sialylglycopolymers rather than 3′-fetuin and 6′-fetuin yielded similar results (Figure S2A). In a fetuin-binding inhibition assay, we compared binding of the viruses to a panel of sialylglycopolymers containing several different sialyloligosaccharide moieties (Figure S2B). In this assay, the wild-type and mutant H5 viruses in general bound less avidly as compared to the control avian H1N1 virus A/Duck/Bavaria/1/1977 and human H3N2 virus A/HongKong/1/1968. HAwild-type and HAH103Y, T156A bound stronger to various α2,3-SA analogs than to α2,6-SA, whereas HAQ222L, G224S and HAQ222L, G224S, H103Y, T156A showed the opposite binding preference (Figure S2B), thus yielding similar results as the direct binding assays. In a third approach, we assessed the binding of PR8 viruses expressing wild-type or mutant H5 HA in a HA assay using normal turkey red blood cells (TRBC) that contain both α2,3-SA and α2,6-SA or modified TRBC that contain either α2,3-SA or α2,6-SA alone or no SA (Figure 3C). As shown previously, introduction of Q222L and G224S in H5 HA resulted in a switch in receptor binding preference from α2,3-SA to α2,6-SA (Chutinimitkul et al., 2010aChutinimitkul S. van Riel D. Munster V.J. van den Brand J.M. Rimmelzwaan G.F. Kuiken T. Osterhaus A.D. Fouchier R.A. de Wit E. In vitro assessment of attachment pattern and replication efficiency of H5N1 influenza A viruses with altered receptor specificity.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 6825-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Additional introduction of the H103Y and T156A substitutions required for airborne transmission increased the HA titers to both α2,3-SA and α2,6-SA containing TRBC. Each of the individual receptor-binding site substitutions Q222L and G224S in the context of changes H103Y and T156A displayed binding to α2,6-SA containing TRBC, which is in agreement with the fact that single RBS substitutions were sufficient for airborne transmission (Figure 1B). Introduction of H103Y in HAwild-type, HAT156A, HAQ222L, G224S, and HAT156A, Q222L, G224S did not result in consistent changes in HA titers. In contrast, introduction of T156A in HAwild-type, HAH103Y, HAQ222L, G224S, and HAH103Y, Q222L, G224S resulted in dual receptor specificity as indicated by a consistent ≥2-fold increase in HA titers, irrespective of the HA used. Collectively, we conclude from these studies that H103Y had no discernable effect on receptor binding preference, whereas T156A increased overall virus binding to both α2,3-SA and α2,6-SA, thus resulting in dual receptor specificity. Upon virus attachment to SA receptors on the cell surface and internalization into endosomes, a low-pH-triggered conformational change of HA mediates fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes to release the virus genome in the cytoplasm (Shaw and Palese, 2013Shaw M.L. Palese P. Fields Virology.in: Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2013: 1151-1185Google Scholar). We measured the pH threshold required for fusion of wild-type and mutant HAs. Vero cells were transfected with HA-expression plasmids and exposed to trypsin to cleave and activate the HA, followed by acidification of the cell culture at a pH range of 5.2 to 6.0. Visual inspection of the cell cultures for the presence of syncytia (multinucleated cells) was used to determine the pH threshold required for fusion (Figure 4A). Fusion of HAwild-type was triggered at pH ≤ 5.6, similar to the threshold pH of the control H5 HA of A/Hongkong/156/97 (pH ≤ 5.8). HA of the control human H3N2 virus A/Netherlands/213/03 required a lower pH (≤5.2) for fusion to occur. These data are in agreement with the observation that avian influenza virus HAs generally trigger fusion at a higher pH than human virus HAs (Galloway et al., 2013Galloway S.E. Reed M.L. Russell C.J. Steinhauer D.A. Influenza HA subtypes demonstrate divergent phenotypes for cleavage activation and pH of fusion: implications for host range and adaptation.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003151Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The three substitutions that affect receptor binding (T156A, Q222L, G224S; see above) did not result in a reduction of the threshold pH for fusion as compared to HAwild-type. In contrast, upon introduction of H103Y in HAwild-type and HAT156A, Q222L, G224S, fusion was triggered only at pH 5.2 and lower. Moreover, HAH103Y, T156A, Q222L and HAH103Y, T156A, G224S also triggered fusion at relatively low pH (pH ≤ 5.2 and pH ≤ 5.4, respectively). As a second readout for fusion, we used a “cell content mixing assay,” in which two populations of Vero cells were transfected with HA and either a chloramphenicol-acetyl-transferase construct under control of the HIV-1 promoter (LTR-CAT) or an HIV-1 transactivator construct (pTat). Upon mixing of the two cell populations and after acidification of the cell culture at a pH range of 5.2 to 6.0, fusion was quantified by measuring CAT expression that is dependent on the expression of Tat. Also in this assay, introduction of H103Y in HAwild-type and HAT156A, Q222L, G224S resulted in a lower threshold pH for fusion, as indicated by the dotted lines in Figures 4B and 4C, respectively. The difference in pH required for fusion between HA with and without H103Y was similar to that observed for the reference A/H3N2 and A/H5N1 HAs (Figure 4D). The switch of influenza virus HA from a metastable nonfusogenic to a stable fusogenic conformation can also be triggered at neutral pH when the HA is exposed to increasing temperature. This conformational change of HA is biochemically indistinguishable from the change triggered by low pH (Carr et al., 1997Carr C.M. Chaudhry C. Kim P.S. Influenza hemagglutinin is spring-loaded by a metastable native conformation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 14306-14313Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and results in a loss in the ability to bind receptor. To further investigate HA stability, PR8 viruses harboring wild-type or mutant HAs were incubated at increasing temperatures, after which the ability of the viruses to agglutinate TRBCs was quantified. The PR8 virus with the H3 HA of A/Netherlands/213/03 retained HA activity even upon treatment for 30 min at 60°C. In contrast, PR8 with H5 HA of A/Indonesia/5/05 lost HA activity upon treatment at 56°C for 30 min. Irrespective of the presence or absence of substitutions affecting receptor binding (HAwild-type, HAT156A, HAQ222L, G224S, and HAT156A, Q222L, G224S were tested), H103Y resulted in increased temperature stability as measured in the HA assay (Figure 4E). Collectively, these data indicate that H103Y has a stabilizing effect on the HA of A/Indonesia/5/05—with respect to both low pH and high temperature treatment—irrespective of the presence or absence of substitutions that affect receptor binding. The influenza virus polymerase complex—consisting of the polymerase proteins PA, PB1, and PB2—transcribes the negative sense viral RNA ((−)vRNA) in mRNA and positive sense copy RNA ((+)cRNA), the latter of which is used as the template to yield newly synthesized (−)vRNA. To read out polymerase complex function, we used a (−)vRNA reporter construct consisting of the firefly luciferase open reading frame flanked by the noncoding regions of segment 8 of influenza A virus (de Wit et al., 2010de Wit E. Munster V.J. van Riel D. Beyer W.E. Rimmelzwaan G.F. Kuiken T. Osterhaus A.D. Fouchier R.A. Molecular determinants of adaptation of highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N7 viruses to efficient replication in the human host.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 1597-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Upon cotransfection of the reporter with expression plasmids encoding PB1, PB2, PA, and NP, the (−)vRNA reporter is transcribed and the firefly luciferase protein is expressed. A plasmid that constitutively expresses Renilla luciferase was cotransfected as an internal control to standardize transfection efficiency and sample processing. Substitution E627K in PB2 resulted in a 12-fold increase in firefly luciferase expression as compared to the wild-type PB2. Substitution H99Y in PB1 resulted in a 3-fold increase. The polymerase complex with both PB2-E627K and PB1-H99Y yielded a 25-fold increase in firefly luciferase expression as compared to the polymerase complex of the wild-type virus (Figure 5A). To study the levels of transcription of (−)vRNA, (+)cRNA, and mRNA during the course of a viral infection, we performed primer extension assays using total cellular RNA isolated upon virus inoculation of MDCK cells. Three hours after inoculation with A/H5N1wild-type, all three RNA species were detected (Figure 5B). Introduction of E627K in PB2 resulted in elevated levels of the viral RNAs, predominantly increasing the amount of (−)vRNA and (+)cRNA, while marginally changing mRNA. Substitution H99Y in PB1 resulted in slightly reduced levels of all detected RNA species as compared with A/H5N1wild-type. Upon inoculation with a virus containing both PB2-E627K and PB1-H99Y, the ratio between (−)vRNA, (+)cRNA, and mRNA was similar as observed for A/H5N1wild-type but with higher overall levels of all three RNA species. As a third test of polymerase function, we studied in vitro replication of the recombinant A/H5N1 viruses with and without polymerase substitutions by measuring plaque sizes upon inoculation of MDCK cells. At 48 hr after inoculation, cells were fixed and stained with an anti-NP antibody, and the number of pixels representing ∼100 to 500 plaques on digital images was quantified. As compared to A/H5N1wild-type, A/H5N1PB2 E627K and A/H5N1PB1 H99Y displayed a slight reduction in plaque size. However, combination of these two substitutions (A/H5N1PB2 E627K, PB1 H99Y) yielded plaques that were significantly larger than those observed for A/H5N1wild-type (Figure 5C). From these assays, we conclude that PB2-E627K and PB1-H99Y collectively resulted in increased levels of (−)vRNA, (+)cRNA, and mRNA transcription and increased virus replication in MDCK cells.

Sensory reflexes are particularly fast in flying insects such as flies, but the means by which they evade aerial predators is not known. Using high-speed videography and automated tracking of flies in combination with aerodynamic measurements on flapping robots, we show that flying flies react to looming stimuli with directed banked turns. The maneuver consists of a rapid body rotation followed immediately by an active counter-rotation and is enacted by remarkably subtle changes in wing motion. These evasive maneuvers of flies are substantially faster than steering maneuvers measured previously and indicate the existence of sensory-motor circuitry that can reorient the fly's flight path within a few wingbeats."

Because pneumococci can take up DNA from their environment by a process called competence, genes associated with antibiotic resistance can rapidly spread. Remarkably, competence is activated in response to several antibiotics. Here, we demonstrate that antibiotics targeting DNA replication cause an increase in the copy number of genes proximal to the origin of replication (oriC). As the genes required for competence initiation are located near oriC, competence is thereby activated. Transcriptome analyses show that antibiotics targeting DNA replication also upregulate origin-proximal gene expression in other bacteria. This mechanism is a direct, intrinsic consequence of replication fork stalling. Our data suggest that evolution has conserved the oriC-proximal location of important genes in bacteria to allow for a robust response to replication stress without the need for complex gene-regulatory pathways.

Small GTPases of the Ras family are central nodes in early signal transduction networks that actuate a plethora of cellular processes relevant to proliferation and survival. The high penetrance of activating Ras mutations in human malignancies highlights the oncogenic potential of Ras GTPases. They feature a highly conserved N-terminal guanine-nucleotide binding G-domain that is responsible for catalytic hydrolysis and effector binding (Scheffzek et al., 1997Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmüller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. The Ras-RasGAP complex: structural basis for GTPase activation and its loss in oncogenic Ras mutants.Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar) that becomes GTP loaded by guanine nucleotide exchange factors in response to upstream signals such as those from growth factor receptors situated in the PM. GTP-loaded Ras interacts specifically with effector proteins, thereby recruiting them to the PM. The resulting increase in effector concentration potentiates their phosphorylation, which in turn activates the effectors to propagate the signal (Zamir et al., 2013Zamir E. Vartak N. Bastiaens P.I.H. Oncogenic Signaling from the Plasma Membrane.in: Yarden Y. Tarcic G. Vesicle Trafficking in Cancer. Springer, New York2013: 57-74Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The level of Ras enrichment at the PM is therefore a critical parameter for Ras-mediated signaling that can be exploited to affect aberrant oncogenic signaling (Chandra et al., 2012Chandra A.

Enrichment of Ras proteins on the PM is partly attributed to aspecific hydrophobic interactions via permanent C-terminal farnesylation. How this enrichment can be attained in presence of the abundant and densely folded endomembrane (EM) surfaces (Shibata et al., 2010Shibata Y. Shemesh T. Prinz W.A. Palazzo A.F. Kozlov M.M. Rapoport T.A. Mechanisms determining the morphology of the peripheral ER.Cell. 2010; 143: 774-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) is unclear. In contrast to transmembrane proteins that are stably incorporated into membranes, the farnesyl tail of Ras proteins confers a much weaker membrane anchoring. Ras proteins thereby exhibit an exchange rate between membranes on a minute timescale (Leventis and Silvius, 1998Leventis R. Silvius J.R.

For H- and NRas, a dynamic acylation cycle consisting of S-palmitoylation at the Golgi and depalmitoylation at all membranes in the cell, counters the entropic tendency of the system to slowly re-equilibrate palmitoylated Ras to the extensive endomembrane surface area (Dekker et al., 2010Dekker F.J.

Membrane phosphatidylserine regulates surface charge and protein localization.Science. 2008; 319: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). However, it has been recently shown that the activity of the GDI-like solubilizing factor (GSF) PDEδ is also essential for the PM localization of farnesylated Ras proteins (Chandra et al., 2012Chandra A. Grecco H.E. Pisupati V. Perera D. Cassidy L. Skoulidis F. Ismail S.A. Hedberg C. Hanzal-Bayer M.

Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 148-158Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The paradox of a solubilizing activity contributing to PM enrichment points to the existence of a dynamic mechanism that maintains an out-of-equilibrium distribution of KRas at the PM. To explore the mechanisms that maintain KRas at the PM, we extract kinetic parameters such as protein mobility and affinities to subcellular membrane compartments from fluorescence microscopy experiments in live cells. The ranges of such parameters span orders of magnitude: cytosolic diffusion occurs at ∼10 μm2/s, membrane diffusion at ∼1 μm2/s (Colarusso and Spring, 2002Colarusso P. Spring K.R. Reticulated lipid probe fluorescence reveals MDCK cell apical membrane topography.Biophys.

Diffusion of green fluorescent protein in the aqueous-phase lumen of endoplasmic reticulum.Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2843-2851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and compartmental exchange rates can be even slower on the timescale of minutes to hours (Leventis and Silvius, 1998Leventis R. Silvius J.R. Lipid-binding characteristics of the polybasic carboxy-terminal sequence of K-ras4B.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7640-7648Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Disentangling these processes does not only pose a challenge to experimental design, but also to data-analysis via analytical models in simplified geometries. To overcome these limitations, we based our data fitting on cellular automaton (CA) 3D-reaction-diffusion simulations (Markus et al., 1999Markus M. Böhm D. Schmick M. Simulation of vessel morphogenesis using cellular automata.Math. Biosci. 1999; 156: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, Toffoli and Margolus, 1987Toffoli T. Margolus N. Cellular Automata Machines: A new environment for modelling. MIT press, Cambridge, MA1987Google Scholar, Von Neumann, 1966Von Neumann J. Theory of self-reproducing automata.in: Burks B.A.W. University of Illinois Press, Urbana1966Google Scholar) that are performed in measured cellular geometries. Besides measuring kinetic parameters by fitting data obtained from photoactivation fluorescence microscopy experiments, these in silico models serve a second purpose. The CA simulations were also used to incorporate the observations from different experimental approaches into a coherent picture of a dynamic cycle that counters thermodynamic equilibration of KRas to endomembranes. We thereby show that the RE collects solubilized KRas from endomembranes to redirect it back to the PM. Without competitive binding to endomembranes due to farnesyl-derived hydrophobicity, KRas partitioning would be exclusively between cytosol and the negatively charged PM and could result in a prominent enrichment at the PM by strong electrostatic interaction. We therefore quantified the localization of the nonfarnesylated KRasSAAX mutant with an intact polybasic stretch and found homogeneous cytosolic localization with no detectable membrane localization (Figure 1A). The fact that the polybasic stretch of KRas by itself is insufficient to enrich it at the PM suggests that only the combination of hydrophobic interaction via the farnesyl tail and electrostatic interaction enables enrichment at the PM. However, adding hydrophobic affinity comes at the price of competitive binding to endomembranes as their total surface area becomes a limiting factor for enrichment of KRas at the PM. The hydrophobicity conferred by farnesylation allows association of KRas to all cellular membranes. In the absence of energy-consuming processes that maintain an asymmetric partition of KRas, association rates of KRas to the PM as well as to endomembranes balance their respective dissociation rates at thermodynamic equilibrium. In this scenario, the ratios of association (kas) over dissociation (kdis) rate constants and the ratio of total membrane surface area S of plasma membrane (PM) over endomembranes (EM) determine the concentration of KRas at the PM:[KRasPM]/[KRasEM]=((kas,PM⋅SPM)/kdis,PM)⋅(kdis,EM/(kas,EM⋅SEM)). For solely farnesylated, uncharged Ras, the association and dissociation rate constants are identical for PM and endomembranes and therefore its partitioning will solely depend on the relative surface ratios of PM over endomembranes. To determine this surface ratio experimentally, the relative fluorescence intensity of mutant mCitrine-HRasC181S,C184S on endomembranes was compared to that in a lamellipodial PM region. This yielded an EM/PM ratio of 201 ± 60 (Figure 1B and Figure S1, available online, Supplemental Information), which compares well with the theoretical upper limit of 320-fold for a densely packed endomembrane system (Shibata et al., 2010Shibata Y. Shemesh T. Prinz W.A. Palazzo A.F. Kozlov M.M. Rapoport T.A. Mechanisms determining the morphology of the peripheral ER.Cell. 2010; 143: 774-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) (Supplemental Information). Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements of mCitrine-KRas in the cytoplasm yielded two discernable correlation times, revealing its interaction with endomembranes (Figure 1C). Fitting the autocorrelation of fluorescence fluctuations to a model with two diffusion coefficients resulted in 0.38 μm2/s and 24 μm2/s, consistent with diffusion on a membrane (Knight et al., 2010Knight J.D. Lerner M.G. Marcano-Velázquez J.G. Pastor R.W. Falke J.J. Single molecule diffusion of membrane-bound proteins: window into lipid contacts and bilayer dynamics.Biophys.

Phys. Lipids. 2013; 172–173: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and cytosolic diffusion (Dayel et al., 1999Dayel M.J. Hom E.F.Y. Verkman A.S. Diffusion of green fluorescent protein in the aqueous-phase lumen of endoplasmic reticulum.Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2843-2851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), respectively. This cytosolic fraction communicates the exchange and equilibration of KRas among endomembranes and the PM. From the fractional contribution of these diffusional processes in the cytoplasm, KRas partitioning between endomembranes and cytosol was estimated as ∼2:1 (Experimental Procedures). In contrast, the ratio of PM-bound KRas over cytosolic KRas was ∼10:1, as estimated by comparing the fluorescence intensity of mCitrine-KRas in the nucleus with that at the PM. Since the association rate constant of KRas to all membranes must be equal, a 10-fold PM enrichment can only occur if the dissociation rate constant of KRas from the PM is 200∗10/2 = 1,000-fold smaller than that from endomembranes. To address whether an exchange of KRas between PM and endomembranes occurs, a fluorescence loss after photoactivation (FLAP) experiment of photoactivatable PAGFP-KRas (Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. A photoactivatable GFP for selective photolabeling of proteins and cells.Science. 2002; 297: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar) was performed. To derive the residence time of KRas at the basal PM, photoactivation was restricted by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). The loss of fluorescence in the evanescent TIRF-field after photoactivation is not only determined by dissociation and diffusion, but also by fluorophore photophysics and the geometry of the cell. To extract parameter values for all these processes, we developed a CA-based numerical 3D-reaction-diffusion-simulation in realistic cell geometries. It reproduces the FLAP experiments in silico and is fast enough for iterative data fitting by minimizing the residuals between simulated and experimental FLAP curves (Figure 2A). A basic FLAP experiment with a single photoactivation pulse showed that the loss of fluorescence from the basal PM is dominated by rapid lateral diffusion and photobleaching, which hinders the detection of KRas dissociation from the PM. To observe this dissociation with high precision, we developed a multipulse photoactivation experiment, in which rapid lateral diffusion of PAGFP-KRas saturates the fluorescence of the whole PM during the initial phase of the time-lapse, while the slow off rate from the PM dominates the later phase (Figure 2A). This multipulse photoactivation and fluorescence recording pattern was directly fitted with the CA-based algorithm. We obtained a lateral diffusion coefficient of 1.00 ± 0.15 μm2/s, in agreement with previously reported values for peripheral membrane proteins (Knight et al., 2010Knight J.D. Lerner M.G. Marcano-Velázquez J.G. Pastor R.W. Falke J.J. Single molecule diffusion of membrane-bound proteins: window into lipid contacts and bilayer dynamics.Biophys.

Phys. Lipids. 2013; 172–173: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and found that KRas has a finite residence time of 7.4 min (koff = 0.135 ± 0.036 min−1; Figure 2B) at the PM. This residence time depends on the combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction. To investigate how electrostatics affects the dissociation of KRas from the PM (Figure 2B, Table S1), we introduced repulsive, negatively charged glutamates in the polybasic stretch. This mimics the electrostatic switch that occurs by serine phosphorylation in the polybasic stretch (Bivona et al., 2006Bivona T.G. Quatela S.E. Bodemann B.O. Ahearn I.M. Soskis M.J. Mor A. Miura J. Wiener H.H. Wright L. Saba S.G. et al.PKC regulates a farnesyl-electrostatic switch on K-Ras that promotes its association with Bcl-XL on mitochondria and induces apoptosis.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 481-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). KRas9K1E showed an increase in apparent off rates by 86% compared to wild-type KRas, which was further increased to 146% upon introduction of a second negative charge in the KRas9K2E mutant (Figure 2B). Introducing more than two glutamates in the HVR reduced the affinity for the PM to such a degree that no enrichment could be observed. These results underscore that even though electrostatic interaction alone is not sufficient to generate KRas enrichment at the PM, this interaction is essential to maintain KRas at the PM by enhancing its residence time. Increasing the positive charge of the polybasic stretch by cumulative introduction of lysines (Table S1) conversely strengthens this interaction (Figure 2B). However, one additional lysine (KRas10K) was sufficient to lower the apparent koff to an asymptotic value of 0.115 ± 0.020 min−1. This indicates that a polybasic stretch of 10 or more lysines confers a PM affinity that is strong enough for dissociation to be superseded in removing KRas from the PM by another process. To assess whether fission processes such as endocytosis contribute to this apparent koff, we blocked dynamin-mediated endocytosis with dynasore (Macia et al., 2006Macia E. Ehrlich M. Massol R. Boucrot E. Brunner C. Kirchhausen T. Dynasore, a cell-permeable inhibitor of dynamin.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 839-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar) and observed a 26% decrease in koff (Figure 2C) to a value of 0.098 ± 0.032 min−1. KRas13K that has four additional lysines showed an even lower apparent off rate of 0.081 ± 0.023 min−1 upon treatment with dynasore. Both values are an underestimation of the contribution of endocytosis to koff because dynamin-dependent endocytosis is not the only form of PM vesiculation (Grant and Donaldson, 2009Grant B.D.

However, the asymptotic off rate, which is reached upon extending the polybasic stretch, represents the cumulative rate constant of all PM-vesiculation processes that remove KRas from the PM. Subtracting this cumulative rate constant from the apparent koff of wild-type KRas results in the rate of dissociation from the PM as kdis,PM = 0.020 min−1 (∼40 min, red arrow in Figure 2C). This shows that endocytosis removes KRas from the PM at a five times faster rate than dissociation. The negative charge of vesicular membranes is diminished after endocytosis (McMahon and Gallop, 2005McMahon H.T. Gallop J.L.

Endocytosis has therefore the same effect as dissociation from the PM, namely to redistribute KRas across all endomembranes. If the rate of KRas internalization by PM vesiculation is independent of the KRas concentration at the PM (i.e., zero-order rate), such a redistribution can be countered by a much faster diffusional exploration of the cell that lets KRas re-encounter the high-affinity binding surface of the PM. However, photoactivation experiments with PAGFP-KRas13K, which has no measurable dissociation, cannot be fitted with models containing a zero-order koff (Figure S3). Thus, endocytosis effectively negates the high-affinity, electrostatic interaction at the PM and the combined rate constants of PM dissociation and endocytosis determine PM-cytosol partitioning of KRas.Figure S3Loss of KRas from the PM by Endocytosis Is a First-Order Rate Process, Related to Figure 2Show full captionThe average fluorescence intensity of the basal PM (red squares) of an MDCK cell expressing PAGFP-KRas13K is plotted against time.

This data were fitted with CA simulations based on two different kinetic models for endocytosis: first-order (blue line) or zero-order (green line). Upper plot shows the residuals of the fits. To resolve the global distribution of KRas in light of dissociation from the PM, endocytosis and competitive binding to endomembranes, we performed CA-based simulations of KRas in an in silico cell with a realistic representation of membrane surfaces (Experimental Procedures). The simulations were performed in a template 3D cell and used the kinetic parameters derived from the above experiments (Supplemental Information). The 200-fold higher surface area of endomembranes was simulated by a 13 times larger number of EM over PM voxels and an increased membrane density per voxel as represented by a 200/13 = 15 times larger kon,EM over kon,PM. From this simulation, we find that the experimentally determined dissociation rate, as well as its variation by orders of magnitude, cannot generate PM enrichment (Figure 2D). The PM over endomembrane partitioning is <1:1 for the experimentally determined values for membrane surface areas, dissociation rates, and endomembrane partitioning, even without endocytosis. This corresponds to the equilibrium condition where the rates of dissociation from membranes are balanced by the association rates (Figure 2D, blue markers). Figure 2E illustrates the effect of reducing the ratio of endomembrane-to-PM surface area, where the observed 10:1 KRas partitioning can only be achieved for an unrealistically low 1:1 ratio of surface areas. Thus, the symmetry breaking feature of the negatively charged inner leaflet of the PM is by itself insufficient to generate PM enrichment of KRas. Aspecific membrane affinity of the farnesyl tail automatically introduces competitive binding to the extensive endomembrane system and thereby negates the advantage of increased membrane affinity. siRNA-mediated knockdown of PDEδ results in the redistribution of KRas to all endomembranes (Figure 3A), which shows that the solubilizing activity of PDEδ is essential for enrichment of KRas at the PM (Chandra et al., 2012Chandra A. Grecco H.E. Pisupati V. Perera D. Cassidy L. Skoulidis F. Ismail S.A. Hedberg C. Hanzal-Bayer M.

In order to understand how KRas solubilization can contribute to PM enrichment, we investigated whether PDEδ extracts KRas directly from membranes or whether it passively sequesters a cytosolic fraction of KRas that is in equilibrium with membranes. Since only in the first mechanism PDEδ contributes to the apparent off rate, the dependence of the off rate of KRas on the expression levels of PDEδ was determined (Figure 3B, Supplemental Information). The analysis of TIRFM-FLAP curves using CA fitting showed no marked increase in the apparent koff for KRas upon ectopic expression of mCherry-PDEδ (Figure 3C). Since we showed that endocytosis is the major contributor to koff, we also analyzed the dependence of the off rate on PDEδ levels for a KRas mutant that lacks two positive charges (PAGFP-KRas2Q). Also in this case, ectopic expression of mCherry-PDEδ did not change the four times higher apparent koff (Figure 3C). On the other hand, the effective diffusion of KRas parameterized by Dint was dependent on PDEδ expression levels (Figure 3C), showing that PDEδ-mediated solubilization helps KRas explore the cellular geometry at cytosolic diffusion speed. These experiments show that binding of KRas to PDEδ is a passive sequestration in the cytoplasm of spontaneously dissociated KRas from any membrane. Using the experimental values of diffusion and KRas endomembrane partitioning in CA simulations, we investigated whether solubilizing KRas by PDEδ can increase the rate of KRas trapping at the PM, thereby reinstating enrichment (Figure 3D). Solubilization depletes KRas from endomembranes more strongly than from the PM, but no set of parameters can be found to achieve the experimentally observed PM enrichment of KRas. Because no such enrichment is possible at thermodynamic equilibrium, this means that KRas must be maintained at the PM by an energy driven mechanism that involves PDEδ. A candidate mechanism for PDEδ regulation is the interaction of the small GTPase Arl2 in the GTP-bound state with an allosteric site on PDEδ. This interaction increases the dissociation rate of the KRas-PDEδ complex approximately 10-fold and thereby can displace farnesylated Ras from PDEδ (Ismail et al., 2011Ismail S.A. Chen Y.-X. Rusinova A. Chandra A. Bierbaum M. Gremer L. Triola G. Waldmann H. Bastiaens P.I.H. Wittinghofer A. Arl2-GTP and Arl3-GTP regulate a GDI-like transport system for farnesylated cargo.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 942-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To first test whether Arl2 is essential for instating PM enrichment of KRas, it was knocked down by RNA-interference (Figures 4A and S4A). This resulted in a drastic loss of KRas enrichment on the PM for ectopically expressed (Figure 4A) as well as endogenous (Figure S4B) KRas. Instead, ectopically expressed KRas was soluble, showing that Arl2 is essential to unload KRas from PDEδ. The interaction of PDEδ with KRas is neither dep"

The intestinal brush border provides an elaborate example with tightly packed microvilli that function in nutrient absorption and host defense. Although the brush border is essential for physiological homeostasis, its assembly is poorly understood. We found that brush border assembly is driven by the formation of Ca2+-dependent adhesion links between adjacent microvilli. Intermicrovillar links are composed of protocadherin-24 and mucin-like protocadherin, which target to microvillar tips and interact to form a trans-heterophilic complex. The cytoplasmic domains of microvillar protocadherins interact with the scaffolding protein, harmonin, and myosin-7b, which promote localization to microvillar tips. Finally, a mouse model of Usher syndrome lacking harmonin exhibits microvillar protocadherin mislocalization and severe defects in brush border morphology. These data reveal an adhesion-based mechanism for brush border assembly and illuminate the basis of intestinal pathology in patients with Usher syndrome.PaperFlickeyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI1ODgwZTNkZGM3NWI3YjYxNjAwNmY1YWNkODNkZmU3MCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4MjEyMDAzfQ.euoNwnhVeSGMrEiyVxr8xTULe7XiB9PZnagnONK_9ohw5tT-HuGdQxo-or-kjsyY7Mx195mryfZ2WPvhwBEWPjtUfgE12MMpzbqwRSquD0nC6db3-CgfzI4KmKg2G58A6CIYoiMQhUYF-m6rN3G9yJbf2duuLEwWcL2FtT0wd7-sz61pD1hJIGaUXo0o12mnkFetmG_-HCEzlxyG5A19X-ifK2jmIm35z1xGyrNw1zriNU95nqNr0pNVeW6RONFOk7EonKRvzg23oujltKgf3p4FIL0zzZhcgLwTpbDNw5levgHDZL8oB871vUGWWYLqdDpVjjscbkzzZao5ZuEo-w(mp4, (25.13 MB) Download video"

Envelope stress-responsive pathways control key steps in LPS biogenesis and respond to defects in the LPS assembly. Accordingly, the LPS content in ΔlapB or Δ(lapA lapB) mutants was elevated, with an enrichment of LPS derivatives with truncations in the core region, some of which were pentaacylated and exhibited carbon chain polymorphism. Further, the levels of LpxC, the enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step of lipid A synthesis, were highly elevated in the Δ(lapA lapB) mutant. Δ(lapA lapB) mutant accumulated extragenic suppressors that mapped either to lpxC, waaC, and gmhA, or to the waaQ operon (LPS biosynthesis) and lpp (Braun's lipoprotein). Increased synthesis of either FabZ (3-R-hydroxymyristoyl acyl carrier protein dehydratase), slrA (novel RpoE-regulated non-coding sRNA), lipoprotein YceK, toxin HicA, or MurA (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase) suppressed some of the Δ(lapA lapB) defects. LapB contains six tetratricopeptide repeats and, at the C-terminal end, a rubredoxin-like domain that was found to be essential for its activity. In pull-down experiments, LapA and LapB co-purified with LPS, Lpt proteins, FtsH (protease), DnaK, and DnaJ (chaperones). A specific interaction was also observed between WaaC and LapB.

https://openalex.org/W2030009739,"Background The swimming crab, Portunus trituberculatus, is an important farmed species in China, has been attracting extensive studies, which require more and more genome background knowledge. To date, the sequencing of its whole genome is unavailable and transcriptomic information is also scarce for this species. In the present study, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcript dataset for major tissues of Portunus trituberculatus by the Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. Results Total RNA was isolated from eyestalk, gill, heart, hepatopancreas and muscle. Equal quantities of RNA from each tissue were pooled to construct a cDNA library. Using the Illumina paired-end sequencing technology, we generated a total of 120,137 transcripts with an average length of 1037 bp. Further assembly analysis showed that all contigs contributed to 87,100 unigenes, of these, 16,029 unigenes (18.40% of the total) can be matched in the GenBank non-redundant database. Potential genes and their functions were predicted by GO, KEGG pathway mapping and COG analysis. Based on our sequence analysis and published literature, many putative genes with fundamental roles in growth and muscle development, including actin, myosin, tropomyosin, troponin and other potentially important candidate genes were identified for the first time in this specie. Furthermore, 22,673 SSRs and 66,191 high-confidence SNPs were identified in this EST dataset. Conclusion The transcriptome provides an invaluable new data for a functional genomics resource and future biological research in Portunus trituberculatus. The data will also instruct future functional studies to manipulate or select for genes influencing growth that should find practical applications in aquaculture breeding programs. The molecular markers identified in this study will provide a material basis for future genetic linkage and quantitative trait loci analyses, and will be essential for accelerating aquaculture breeding programs with this species."

Here, we show that inhibition of Nnt results in decreased 1) mitochondrial H2O2 removal rates, 2) cellular NADPH levels, 3) TrxR and Trx activity in isolated mitochondria, and increased 4) mitochondrial Prx oxidation and 5) sensitivity to ROS production and oxidative cell death. These data implicate Nnt as the link between mitochondrial respiration and H2O2 catabolism via the Trx/Prx antioxidant pathway. All chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted. All animal experiments were performed with approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Mitochondria were isolated from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously through a Percoll density gradient centrifugation (14Drechsel D.A. Patel M.

Purity of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions was confirmed by Western blotting for actin, lamin B, and complex IV (see Fig. 1A). Protein levels were determined by the Bradford assay. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rat brains were homogenized in isolation buffer, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatant was removed and saved as the cytosolic fraction, and mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in desired assay buffer, and protein levels were determined by Bradford protein assay. N27 immortalized rat dopaminergic cells were a kind gift from Drs. Curt Freed and Kedar Prasad at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus (26Prasad K.N. Carvalho E. Kentroti S.

Dharmacon provided three predesigned gene-specific shRNA lentiviral particles, and all three were screened for transfection efficiency. The best lentiviral particle was used for the remainder of the experiments (GGAGTATCCACATTTCGCA). According to the manufacturer's instructions, RNA from transfected N27 cells was isolated using the RNeasy kit® (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was quantified through 260/280 wavelength measurement by a Nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Pure RNA was reverse transcribed using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real-time PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-time PCR system. Primers and probes for rat 18 S, Nnt, TrxR2, and TrxR1 were purchased from Applied Biosystems.

Cells were collected and lysed in 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, and protein levels were determined by Bradford protein assay. 500 μg of cell solution was used to initiate the reaction, and the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH was measured in a 1-ml cuvette spectophotometrically at 25 °C for 3 min. TrxR and Trx activity was measured in isolated pure rat brain mitochondria using an insulin reduction assay in the presence of Escherichia coli Trx or rat TrxR as described previously by Arnér et al. (31Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Measurement of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase.Curr. Protoc. Toxicol. 2001; (chapter 7, Unit 7 4)PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. 25 μg of isolated mitochondria were plated and exposed to respiration substrates, palmitoyl-CoA or water for 15 min. After incubation, mitochondria were lysed with 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100 added to the assay buffer without exogenously added NADPH. After a 1-h incubation, the number of reduced thiols was determined on a Versamax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). H2O2 removal rates were measured in 1 × 106 cells per sample or 100 μg of isolated pure rat brain or liver mitochondria (as determined by Bradford assay) using a 100 μm Clark-type electrode with an Apollo 4000 Free Radical Analyzer (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL). Measurements were conducted as described previously by Drechsel et al. (14Drechsel D.A. Patel M. Respiration-dependent H2O2 removal in brain mitochondria via the thioredoxin/peroxiredoxin system.J.

Briefly, respiration substrates and/or pharmacological inhibitors were added, and a stable H2O2 removal rate was measured. Next, mitochondria or cells were added to the chamber, and H2O2 removal rates were calculated based on the linear signal decay after the addition of mitochondria or cells compared with rates with respiration substrates or pharmacological inhibitors. Nnt activity was measured on Shimadzu UV-2401PC UV-visible recording spectrophotometer (Kyoto, Japan) as described previously by Rydström and Shimomura et al. (32Rydström J.

Briefly isolated mitochondria or N27 cells were suspended in an activity buffer, and 300 μm APAD and NADPH plus pharmacological inhibitors were added. Nnt activity was measured over a 3-min linear decay period with a dual wavelength of 375 nm and 400 nm (reference) in a 1-ml cuvette at 37 °C. The concentration of NADP+, NAD+, NADH, and NADPH in cells was measured using a HPLC system with spectrophotometer detection (Elite LaChrom System; Hitachi) following the method described previously (34Kalhorn T.F. Thummel K.E. Nelson S.D. Slattery J.T. Analysis of oxidized and reduced pyridine dinucleotides in rat liver by high-performance liquid chromatography.Anal.

The reduced forms were extracted by 0.25 m KOH (basic condition) and then passed through a Millipore ultrafree Eppendorf filtration system (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to eliminate proteins then 1 m KH2PO4 (one-fourth volume) was added to neutralize pH. The oxidized forms were extracted by 0.1 n perchloric acid (acidic condition) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to precipitate protein. The pyridine dinucleotides were then separated with a YMC-Pack ODS-A column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm, Waters, Milford, MA), and the mobile phase was 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.0) and 5% (v/v) methanol for the reduced forms and 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 5.0) and 5% (v/v) methanol for the oxidized forms. NADPH and NADH were measured by the absorbance at 340 nm and NADP+ and NAD+ at 254 nm. GSH assay was performed with an ESA 5600 CoulArray HPLC equipped with eight electrochemical cells as described previously by Liang and Patel (35Liang L.P. Patel M. Seizure-induced changes in mitochondrial redox status.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The potentials of the electrochemical cells were set, and analyte separation was conducted on a TOSOHAAS (Montgomeryville, PA) reverse-phase ODS 80-TM C-18 analytical column (4.6 mm × 250 cm; 5-μm particle size). A two-component gradient elution system was used with component A of the mobile phase composed of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 3.2, and component B composed of 50 mm NaH2PO4 and 40% methanol, pH 3.2. An aliquot (40 μl) of the supernatant was injected into the HPLC. Total protein levels were measured using standard SDS-PAGE Western blots with 15 μg of mitochondria, cytosol, or cell extract. Actin was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) and used at 1:10,000. Lamin B was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and complex IV was purchased from Mitosciences (Eugene, OR) and diluted to 1:1,000. Goat anti-rabbit secondary was purchased from Abcam and used at 1:10,000. Antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and bands were imaged on a Storm Optical Scanner (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The redox state of Prx3 was conducted as described previously by Cox et al. (36Cox, A. G., Winterbourn, C. C., Hampton, M. B., Measuring the redox state of cellular peroxiredoxins by immunoblotting. Methods Enzymol. 474, 51–66Google Scholar) and optimized in rat N27 cells. Prx3 primary antibody was purchased from Abcam, and secondary anti-mouse antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA) and used at 1:2,500 and 1:10,000, respectively. Bands were quantified using densitometry with NIH ImageJ software (Bethesda, MD). Oxygen consumption rates were determined using a Seahorse XF24 analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences, North Billerica, MA) and conducted as outlined previously in Cantu et al. (27Cantu D. Fulton R.E.

Tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (Invitrogen) was conducted as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Abcam) with a slight modification. 2.0 × 104 cells/well were seeded and allowed to grow overnight. Medium was removed and replaced with RPMI along with 20 μm carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone as a positive control. After 10 min of incubation, 1 μm tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester was added and incubated for 20 min. After incubation cells were washed three times with warmed PBS supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) BSA and immediately read on SynergyTM multi-mode microplate reader. All values were normalized to protein as determined by a Bradford assay. H2O2 levels were measured using the Amplex Red fluorescence assay (Invitrogen) (27Cantu D. Fulton R.E. Drechsel D.A. Patel M.

Cells were plated in 96-well plate at 2.0 × 104 cells/well. Medium and cell lysis (Tris/NaCl + 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) samples were collected, and lactate dehydrogenase levels was measured by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase enzyme activity as described by Bergmeyer et al.

Data were analyzed in GraphPad Prism software (version 5; San Diego, CA). One-way ANOVA was used to test differences between multiple groups with a Bonferroni post test. To determine statistical significance between two groups a two-tailed Student's t test was utilized. To implicate Nnt in mitochondrial H2O2 catabolism, we asked whether pharmacological inhibition of Nnt directly affected the rates of H2O2 removal in isolated mitochondria and whether this occurred in a respiration-dependent manner. A polarographic method using a Clark-type electrode was used to measure real-time H2O2 levels in isolated brain mitochondria. Isolated pure brain mitochondria (Fig. 1A) had Nnt inhibited with the pharmacological inhibitor palmitoyl-CoA (38Rydstrom J.

Manipulating the expression of an odorant receptor or the activity of the olfactory neurons altered olfactory neuron axonal pathfinding.

https://openalex.org/W2113778621,"Diverse cellular processes require microtubules to be organized into distinct structures, such as asters or bundles. Within these dynamic motifs, microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are frequently under load, but how force modulates these proteins' function is poorly understood. Here, we combine optical trapping with TIRF-based microscopy to measure the force dependence of microtubule interaction for three nonmotor MAPs (NuMA, PRC1, and EB1) required for cell division. We find that frictional forces increase nonlinearly with MAP velocity across microtubules and depend on filament polarity, with NuMA's friction being lower when moving toward minus ends, EB1's lower toward plus ends, and PRC1's exhibiting no directional preference. Mathematical models predict, and experiments confirm, that MAPs with asymmetric friction can move directionally within actively moving microtubule pairs they crosslink. Our findings reveal how nonmotor MAPs can generate frictional resistance in dynamic cytoskeletal networks via micromechanical adaptations whose anisotropy may be optimized for MAP localization and function within cellular structures."

https://openalex.org/W1965620479,"Ubiquitin ligase plays a fundamental role in regulating multiple cellular events in eukaryotes by fine-tuning the stability and activity of specific target proteins. We have previously shown that ubiquitin ligase ATL31 regulates plant growth in response to nutrient balance between carbon and nitrogen (C/N) in Arabidopsis. Subsequent study demonstrated that ATL31 targets 14-3-3 proteins for ubiquitination and modulates the protein abundance in response to C/N-nutrient status. However, the underlying mechanism for the targeting of ATL31 to 14-3-3 proteins remains unclear. Here, we show that ATL31 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. We identified Thr209, Ser247, Ser270, and Ser303 as putative 14-3-3 binding sites on ATL31 by motif analysis. Mutation of these Ser/Thr residues to Ala in ATL31 inhibited the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Additionally, we identified in vivo phosphorylation of Thr209 and Ser247 on ATL31 by MS analysis. A peptide competition assay showed that the application of synthetic phospho-Thr209 peptide, but not the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide, suppresses the interaction between ATL31 and 14-3-3 proteins. Moreover, Arabidopsis plants overexpressing mutated ATL31, which could not bind to 14-3-3 proteins, showed accumulation of 14-3-3 proteins and growth arrest in disrupted C/N-nutrient conditions similar to wild-type plants, although overexpression of intact ATL31 resulted in repression of 14-3-3 accumulation and tolerance to the conditions. Together, these results demonstrate that the physiological role of phosphorylation at 14-3-3 binding sites on ATL31 is to modulate the binding ability and stability of 14-3-3 proteins to control plant C/N-nutrient response.

The ability to sense and respond to nutrient levels is critical for the growth of all living systems. Plants, in particular, have developed sophisticated mechanisms to robustly monitor and appropriately respond to the dynamic changes of nutrient availability due to plant immobility. Among many nutrients, carbon and nitrogen are crucial for plants to perform their routine and fundamental cellular activities. Carbon and nitrogen are not only important energy sources and structural components but are also signaling molecules that regulate gene expression, metabolism, physiology, and growth and development (1Rolland F.

The typical plant C/N-nutrient response is observed in the early postgerminative growth of seedlings, at which stage the phase transition from heterotrophic to photo-autotrophic growth occurs in higher plants. Arabidopsis seedlings show purple anthocyanin pigmentation and stop postgerminative growth when grown on disrupted C/N-nutrient medium containing relatively high sugar and low nitrogen (e.g. 300 mm glucose and 0.3 mm nitrogen) (6Martin T.

The expression of photosynthetic genes, such as RBCS (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit) and CAB (chlorophyll a/b-binding protein), is down-regulated by excess sugar in the medium and also repressed in nitrogen-deficient conditions (6Martin T.

On the other hand, the expression of GS2 (glutamine synthase 2), which is involved in the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen in the glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase cycle, is affected by the amount of sugar and/or light/dark treatment (10Oliveira I.C.

ATL31 overexpression led to a carbon/nitrogen-insensitive phenotype of carbon/nitrogen insensitive 1-dominant (cni1-D) plants and resulted in expansion of green-colored cotyledon under high carbon/low nitrogen conditions, whereas the loss-of-function mutant of ATL31 showed a hypersensitive phenotype (9Sato T.

ATL31 is a member of the plant-specific ATL ubiquitin ligase family, which comprises proteins that contain a transmembrane-like hydrophobic region at the N terminus, a GLD region, a RING-H2 type zinc finger domain, and a non-conserved C-terminal region (11Serrano M.

Subsequent proteomic analyses identified 14-3-3 proteins as interactors of ATL31 (12Sato T. Maekawa S. Yasuda S. Domeki Y. Sueyoshi K. Fujiwara M. Fukao Y. Goto D.B. Yamaguchi J.

In particular, 14-3-3 proteins have been reported to regulate primary carbon and nitrogen metabolism by directly interacting with key enzymes (16Bachmann M. Huber J.L. Liao P.C. Gage D.A. Huber S.C.

Further analyses demonstrated that ATL31 directly ubiquitinates 14-3-3 proteins and regulates protein amounts in response to C/N-nutrient conditions, revealing a plant-specific regulatory mechanism of C/N-nutrient signaling via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (12Sato T. Maekawa S. Yasuda S. Domeki Y. Sueyoshi K. Fujiwara M. Fukao Y. Goto D.B. Yamaguchi J. Identification of 14-3-3 proteins as a target of ATL31 ubiquitin ligase, a regulator of the C/N response in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2011; 68: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-proteasome system is one of the most well characterized protein degradation pathways and plays a fundamental role in eukaryotic cellular functions. In this system, ubiquitin ligases function as key regulators to recognize target proteins for proteasomal degradation (19Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6880) Google Scholar, 20Vierstra R.D. The ubiquitin-26S proteasome system at the nexus of plant biology.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin ligase ATL is a plant-specific multigene family and widely conserved in basal and higher plants, including mosses, monocots, and dicots (21Aguilar-Hernández V. Aguilar-Henonin L. Guzman P. Diversity in the architecture of ATLs, a family of plant ubiquitin-ligases, leads to recognition and targeting of substrates in different cellular environments.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e23934Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis genome contains 91 members of the ATL proteins (22Guzmán P. The prolific ATL family of RING-H2 ubiquitin ligases.Plant Signal. Behav. 2012; 7: 1014-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, several ATL proteins have been reported to function in multiple environmental stress adaptation (22Guzmán P. The prolific ATL family of RING-H2 ubiquitin ligases.Plant Signal. Behav. 2012; 7: 1014-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). ATL2, ATL9, and ATL55/RING1 are involved in plant defense response, and ATL78 mediates adaptation to cold stress (23Serrano M. Guzmán P.

Moreover, IDF1 (IRT1 (iron-regulated transporter 1) degradation factor 1)/ATL14 was recently identified as an ubiquitin ligase regulating iron uptake by the direct ubiquitination of the iron transporter IRT1 (27Shin L.J. Lo J.C. Chen G.H. Callis J. Fu H. Yeh K.C. IRT1 degradation factor1, a ring E3 ubiquitin ligase, regulates the degradation of iron-regulated transporter1 in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2013; 25: 3039-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, less is understood about the molecular mechanism mediating target recognition by ATL proteins, including ATL31. The identification of the interaction domain of ATL31 and the signals mediating the interaction is required for further elucidation of the C/N-nutrient signaling mechanism. In this study, we investigated the detailed molecular basis of the interaction between ATL31 and 14-3-3 proteins and demonstrated the phosphorylation signal on specific Ser/Thr residues in the C-terminal region of ATL31 that mediate the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Moreover, analysis of the C/N-nutrient response with transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing mutated ATL31 that could not bind to 14-3-3 proteins indicated the physiological impact of these residues for correct growth regulation via 14-3-3 degradation in response to C/N-nutrient conditions. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) was used as the wild type and the genetic background for all transgenic lines. ATL31-overexpressing plants (35S-ATL31) were as described previously (9Sato T. Maekawa S. Yasuda S. Sonoda Y. Katoh E. Ichikawa T. Nakazawa M. Seki M. Shinozaki K. Matsui M. Goto D.B. Ikeda A.

Col-0 and all transgenic plants were grown under conditions as described previously (28Sako K. Maki Y. Kanai T. Kato E. Maekawa S. Yasuda S. Sato T. Watahiki M.K. Yamaguchi J.

Nicotiana benthamiana was grown under conditions of 16 h light/8 h dark at 22 °C. The coding sequences of ATL6, ATL11, ATL31, 14-3-3χ, 14-3-3υ, 14-3-3λ, 14-3-3ι, 14-3-3ϵ, and FLS2 (flagellin-sensing 2) were amplified from Col-0 cDNA. The substituted forms of ATL31 and 14-3-3λ were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. All primers used are listed in Table 1. Amplified fragments were cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO vector and then transferred into destination vectors using the Gateway system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen).

Bioeng. 2007; 104: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). The constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pMP90) by electroporation. Arabidopsis plants were transformed using the floral dip method (32Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Floral dip: a simplified method for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transformation of MM2d cells was performed as described previously (29Menges M.

Three independent T4 homozygous lines for 35S-ATL31–4A were selected for the carbon/nitrogen response assay. Yeast strain EGY48 was used for the two-hybrid assays. The truncated and substituted forms of ATL31, ATL6, and ATL11 were subcloned into pEG202gw destination vector as bait, and the full-length coding sequences of 14-3-3χ, 14-3-3υ, 14-3-3λ, 14-3-3ι, and 14-3-3ϵ as well as the truncated and substituted forms of 14-3-3λ were subcloned into pJG4–5gw destination vector as prey (Gateway-compatible versions of pEG202 and pJG4-5 vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Hironori Kaminaka, Tottori University). The pEG202 and pJG4-5 vectors were used as vector control. Yeast transformation was performed by the Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II Kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Handling of yeast cultures and β-galactosidase assays was performed as described in the Yeast Protocols Handbook (Clontech). Amounts of expressed 14-3-3 proteins were verified by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody (Wako). For the co-immunoprecipitation assay, the truncated and substituted forms of ATL31 were subcloned into pGWB11 destination vector (31Nakagawa T. Kurose T. Hino T. Tanaka K. Kawamukai M. Niwa Y.

For subcellular localization analysis, the full-length coding sequence of ATL31, which introduced C143S substitution (ATL31C143S), was subcloned into pMDC83 destination vector (34Curtis M.D. Grossniklaus U. A gateway cloning vector set for high-throughput functional analysis of genes in planta.Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar), and the full-length coding sequence of 14-3-3λ was subcloned into pB4GWmC destination vector. For the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay, ATL31C143S was subcloned into pB4GWnG destination vector, the full-length coding sequence of 14-3-3λ was subcloned into pB4GWcG destination vector, and the full-length coding sequence of FLS2 was subcloned into pB4GWmC destination vector (pB4 destination vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Shoji Mano, National Institute for Basic Biology). All constructs were introduced into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 (pMP90) by electroporation. Agrobacterium containing the above constructs was grown in 2× YT medium overnight at 28 °C with shaking. Cultured agrobacterium cells were collected and resuspended with infiltration buffer (10 mm MES, 10 mm MgCl2, and 450 μm acetosyringone, pH 5.6). To enhance transgene expression, agrobacterium expressing the p19 suppressor was resuspended together with all samples (35Voinnet O. Rivas S. Mestre P. Baulcombe D. An enhanced transient expression system in plants based on suppression of gene silencing by the p19 protein of tomato bushy stunt virus.Plant J. 2003; 33: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Agrobacterium suspensions were mixed at equal ratios, and the mixture was infiltrated into the leaves of 3–5-week-old N. benthamiana plants using a needleless syringe. N. benthamiana leaves and MM2d cells were ground in liquid nitrogen and lysed with extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with 10 μm MG132 and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science). After the removal of insoluble materials by centrifugation two times at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, protein concentrations were determined and normalized by a protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) was added to the extracts and gently shaken for 1 h at 4 °C with a rotary shaker. The beads were washed three times with extraction buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) and heated for 30 min at 55 °C. Portions of the extracts prior to immunoprecipitation were also boiled with SDS sample buffer. The proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), anti-Myc tag antibody (MBL), and anti-14-3-3 antibody (12Sato T. Maekawa S. Yasuda S. Domeki Y. Sueyoshi K.

Infiltrated N. benthamiana leaves were used for microscopic analysis at 2 days after infiltration. Fluorescent images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope equipped with a C-Apochromat (×40/1.2 numerical aperture water immersion) objective. Excitation/detection wavelengths were 488/505–550 nm for green fluorescent protein (GFP) and BiFC constructs and 561/575–615 nm for mCherry constructs. Image processing was carried out using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). ATL31C143S-FLAG-overexpressing MM2d cells were ground in liquid nitrogen and lysed with extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with 10 μm MG132, Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science), and PhosSTOP (Roche Applied Science). After the removal of insoluble materials by centrifugation two times at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, protein concentrations were determined and normalized by a protein assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) was added to the extracts and gently shaken for 1 h at 4 °C with a rotary shaker. The beads were washed three times with extraction buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 150 μg/ml 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) in extraction buffer. After precipitation by cold acetone, the proteins were resuspended with SDS sample buffer and heated to 55 °C for 30 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by mass spectrometry analysis. For mass spectrometry analysis, a specific band containing ATL31 was excised after staining with Flamingo stain solution (Bio-Rad). Peptides for LC-MS/MS analysis were then prepared by in-gel digestion using sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) (36Fujiwara M. Umemura K. Kawasaki T. Shimamoto K. Proteomics of Rac GTPase signaling reveals its predominant role in elicitor-induced defense response of cultured rice cells.Plant Physiol. 2006; 140: 734-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using a LTQ-orbitrap XL-HTC-PAL system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The MS/MS spectra were compared against TAIR10 (Arabidopsis Information Resource), and MS scores were calculated using the MASCOT server as described previously (37Fukao Y. Ferjani A. Fujiwara M.

Anti-ATL31 phospho-Thr209 antibody was generated by SCRUM Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) using a phosphorylated Thr209 peptide (CFPRSHpTTGHS). ATL31C143S-FLAG and ATL31C143S-T209A-FLAG were transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) as described above. The proteins were detected by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and anti-ATL31 phospho-Thr209 antibody. For glutathione S-transferase (GST)-KTA purification, the coding sequence of kinase targeted to ATL31 (KTA) was subcloned into pYU1274 destination vector (Gateway-compatible version of pGEX4T-1 kindly provided by Dr. Yoshihisa Ueno, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences). For His-14-3-3λ purification, the full-length coding sequence of 14-3-3λ was subcloned into pDEST-his destination vector (38Tsunoda Y. Sakai N. Kikuchi K. Katoh S. Akagi K. Miura-Ohnuma J. Tashiro Y.

https://openalex.org/W2062662373,"The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that coordinates the cellular response to several kinds of stress. p53 inactivation is an important step in tumor progression. Oligomerization of p53 is critical for its posttranslational modification and its ability to regulate the transcription of target genes necessary to inhibit tumor growth. Here we report that the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC2 interacts with p53. This interaction involves the CPH domain of HERC2 (a conserved domain within Cul7, PARC, and HERC2 proteins) and the last 43 amino acid residues of p53. Through this interaction, HERC2 regulates p53 activity. RNA interference experiments showed how HERC2 depletion reduces the transcriptional activity of p53 without affecting its stability. This regulation of p53 activity by HERC2 is independent of proteasome or MDM2 activity. Under these conditions, up-regulation of cell growth and increased focus formation were observed, showing the functional relevance of the HERC2-p53 interaction. This interaction was maintained after DNA damage caused by the chemotherapeutic drug bleomycin. In these stressed cells, p53 phosphorylation was not impaired by HERC2 knockdown. Interestingly, p53 mutations that affect its tetramerization domain disrupted the HERC2-p53 interaction, suggesting a role for HERC2 in p53 oligomerization. This regulatory role was shown using cross-linking assays. Thus, the inhibition of p53 activity after HERC2 depletion can be attributed to a reduction in p53 oligomerization. Ectopic expression of HERC2 (residues 2292–2923) confirmed these observations. Together, these results identify HERC2 as a novel regulator of p53 signaling.

Together, these results identify HERC2 as a novel regulator of p53 signaling. p53 plays a central role in coordinating cellular responses to stress by determining whether cells respond to various types and levels of stress with apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, senescence, DNA repair, cell metabolism, or autophagy. p53 functions as a transcription factor that activates and represses a wide range of genes. Although some effects of p53 may be independent of transcription, the p53-controlled transactivation of target genes is an essential feature of each stress response pathway. p53 is normally kept at low levels through ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation mediated by several E3 ubiquitin ligases. Activation of p53 in response to stress classically consists of three sequential steps: p53 stabilization, sequence-specific DNA binding, and recruitment of the general transcriptional machinery to activate the transcription of p53 target genes. During these steps, p53 activation is controlled by several posttranslational modifications, such as ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and acetylation, and by interactions with other proteins. Genetic studies suggest that p53 activation in vivo is even more complex, and an antirepression step involving the release of p53 from repression factors such as MDM2 and MDMX has been proposed to reconcile these models (1Bode A.M.

The proteins Cullin 7 (CUL7), Parkin-like cytoplasmic (PARC), and HECT- and RCC1-like domains 2 (HERC2) contain a common domain named CPH (a conserved domain within Cul7, PARC, and HERC2 proteins) (6Andrews P.

HERC proteins can be classified into two subgroups: large (HERC1–2) and small (HERC3–6 in humans and HERC3–5 in mice). Structurally, small HERC proteins contain little more than the two characteristic domains, whereas, functionally, they have been related to ubiquitination and ISGylation processes associated with membrane traffic and the immune response (15Cruz C.

In humans, a single-base mutation in the HERC2 gene has also been implicated in a syndrome similar to Angelman syndrome that causes neurodevelopmental delay (28Harlalka G.V. Baple E.L. Cross H.

Other mutations affecting members of the HERC family have been associated with sterility, growth retardation, and neurodegeneration (30Mashimo T. Hadjebi O. Amair-Pinedo F. Tsurumi T. Langa F.

More recently, HERC2 has also been implicated in cell cycle and DNA damage responses. Thus, it has been reported that HERC2 may function as an assembly factor for the RNF8-Ubc13 complex, which promotes Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination at sites of DNA damage in response to DNA double strand breaks (32Bekker-Jensen S. Rendtlew Danielsen J. Fugger K. Gromova I. Nerstedt A. Lukas C. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mailand N. HERC2 coordinates ubiquitin-dependent assembly of DNA repair factors on damaged chromosomes.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HERC2 interacts with claspin, a protein essential for G2/M checkpoint activation and replication fork stability, suggesting that HERC2 regulates the progression of DNA replication (33Izawa N. Wu W. Sato K. Nishikawa H. Kato A. Boku N. Itoh F. Ohta T. HERC2 Interacts with Claspin and regulates DNA origin firing and replication fork progression.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 5621-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HERC2 may also function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for degradation of the xeroderma pigmentosum A protein during circadian control of nucleotide excision repair and of the breast cancer suppressor BRCA1 during the cell cycle, respectively (34Kang T.H. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Circadian control of XPA and excision repair of cisplatin-DNA damage by cryptochrome and HERC2 ubiquitin ligase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

HERC2 is an E3 ligase that targets BRCA1 for degradation.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 6384-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that NEURL4 is also a substrate of HERC2, participating in the ubiquitin-dependent regulation of centrosome architecture (36Al-Hakim A.K. Bashkurov M. Gingras A.C. Durocher D. Pelletier L. Interaction proteomics identify NEURL4 and the HECT E3 ligase HERC2 as novel modulators of centrosome architecture.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2012; 11: 1-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Additionally, HERC2 can stimulate the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of other E3 ligases such as E6AP (37Kühnle S. Kogel U. Glockzin S. Marquardt A. Ciechanover A. Matentzoglu K. Scheffner M. Physical and functional interaction of the HECT ubiquitin-protein ligases E6AP and HERC2.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 19410-19416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All of these observations suggest a multifunctional role of HERC2 in cell biology. In this study, we report a new function for HERC2. We show that HERC2 binds to p53 and that the silencing of HERC2 alters p53 activity as a transcriptional factor, affecting the expression of genes regulated by p53 such as p21, p53R2, and p53AIPI. Under these conditions, we observed increased cellular growth and focus formation in clonogenic assays. The HERC2-p53 interaction is disrupted by p53 mutations in the tetramerization domain. Additionally, cross-linking experiments with glutaraldehyde indicated that HERC2 regulates the oligomerization of p53. These findings demonstrate that HERC2 is a key component in p53 regulation.

The Gateway system (Invitrogen) was used to generate HERC2 and HERC1 plasmids. cDNAs encoding the amino terminus (residues 1–199), the CPH domain (residues 2547–2640), and the carboxyl terminus (residues 4785–4834) of the human HERC2 protein and the amino terminus (residues 1–155) of the human HERC1 were amplified by PCR from human fetal brain or HeLa cDNA libraries using specific oligonucleotides. Amplified fragments were used to generate entry clones with pDONR221 and expression vectors with pDEST15 (GST fusion) or pDEST17 (His fusion) following standard Gateway protocols. The plasmids were sequenced. Fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria, purified, and used for pulldown experiments and to generate anti-HERC2 (named bvg3 and bvg4 antibodies against residues 1–199 and bvg1 and bvg2 antibodies against residues 4785–4834) and anti-HERC1 (bvg5 and bvg6 antibodies against residues 1–155) polyclonal antibodies, as described previously (15Cruz C.

HeLa, HEK-293, U2OS, and H1299 cells were cultured at 37 °C in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection of cells (plasmids and siRNAs) was carried out using calcium phosphate. Briefly, the day before transfection, the cells were seeded into 6-well plates at 30% confluence. On the day of transfection, cells were at 60% confluence. For a final volume of 100 μl, 50 μl of CaBES solution (500 mm CaCl2 and 100 mm BES (pH 6.95)) was mixed with 50 μl of MilliQ water containing 4 μg of plasmid DNA or siRNA to reach a final concentration of 100 nm. Then, 100 μl of BES solution (280 mm NaCl, 0.75 mm Na2HPO4, 0.75 mm NaH2P04, and 50 mm BES) at the appropriate pH was slowly added while aerating the mix. The final mix was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then added to the cells. Bleomycin or cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml or 15 μg/ml, respectively, at the indicated times. MG132 was added to the cells for 6 h to a final concentration of 10 μm. For the treatment with nutlin, the cells were incubated for 16 h to a final concentration of 10 μm. Cells were lysed and processed as described previously (41Casas-Terradellas E. Tato I. Bartrons R.

Protein levels were normalized and expressed as a percentage of controls. Cells lysed with CHAPS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, and 0.3% CHAPS) containing 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 100 μg/ml benzamidine were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g. Animal tissues were processed and analyzed as described previously (30Mashimo T. Hadjebi O. Amair-Pinedo F. Tsurumi T. Langa F. Serikawa T. Sotelo C. Guénet J.L. Rosa J.L.

For immunoprecipitation (IP), supernatants (input) were incubated with preimmune serum or with anti-HERC2 (bvg3 or bvg4), anti-HERC1 (410 or bvg6), or anti-p53 antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C and immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. In these experiments, HERC2 was detected with anti-HERC2 monoclonal antibody. For pulldowns, supernatants (input) were incubated with 5 μg of purified GST fusion proteins bound to a glutathione resin for 1 h at 4 °C. Pellets were washed three times with CHAPS buffer and analyzed by PAGE and immunoblot analysis. For direct interaction, His-p53 (wild-type, amino acids 1–393), deleted His-p53 (amino acids 1–320), and GST-CPH fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified using Talon or glutathione resins, similarly as described previously (15Cruz C. Ventura F. Bartrons R. Rosa J.L. HERC3 binding to and regulation by ubiquitin.FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 4 μg of purified His-p53 (1–393) or deleted His-p53 (1–320) bound to a resin was incubated with 2 μg of purified GST-CPH protein in 0.2 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm imidazole, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mg/ml BSA) for 1 h at 4 °C. Pellets were washed four times with binding buffer and analyzed by PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 50 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 100 μg/ml benzamidine and incubated on ice for 5 min for permeabilization. Total cell lysates were prepared by resuspending the lysate directly in sample buffer. After permeabilization, the cells were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and considered cytoplasmic fraction. Pellets were washed with buffer A and centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. This step was repeated three times. The final pellet (nuclear fraction) was resuspended in the initial volume half of buffer A. All fractions were sonicated before analysis by PAGE. U2OS or H1299 cells were transfected with the corresponding reporter. Luciferase activity was quantified using a luciferase assay system (Promega). Luciferase values were normalized using β-galactosidase activity measured using the Luminescent β-Galactosidase Detection Kit II (Clontech Laboratories). Luminescence levels are expressed as a percentage of controls. Total RNA was isolated from transfected cells using the Ultraspec RNA isolation system (Biotecx) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR was carried out using the ABI Prism 7900 HT fast real-time PCR system, and commercially available human TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems) were used to quantify gene expression of CDKN1A (p21) (Hs00355782_m1). The housekeeping gene GAPDH (HS99999905_m1) was used for normalization. PCR data were captured and analyzed using the Sequence Detector software (SDS version 2.3, Applied Biosystems). For proliferation assays, 24 h after siRNA transfection, cells were reseeded at 3000 cells/well in triplicate in 6-well dishes for 7 days in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 5% calf serum. The cells were stained with crystal violet (containing 2% ethanol) after dissolving the dye in 1% SDS. The absorbance at 550 nm was quantified and plotted proportional to cell number. For clonogenic assays, 500 cells were reseeded and grown until cells formed sufficiently large colonies (∼15 days). The colonies were stained with crystal violet and quantified using ImageJ software. Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and siRNAs and lysed in CHAPS buffer 72 h after transfection. After lysis, the cells were centrifuged, and the supernatant was recovered. Glutaraldehyde was added to the supernatant at the indicated concentrations and incubated on ice for 30 min, as described previously (38Itahana Y. Ke H.

https://openalex.org/W2007825238,"The production of reactive aldehydes including 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) is a key component of the pathogenesis in a spectrum of chronic inflammatory hepatic diseases including alcoholic liver disease (ALD). One consequence of ALD is increased oxidative stress and altered β-oxidation in hepatocytes. A major regulator of β-oxidation is 5' AMP protein kinase (AMPK). In an in vitro cellular model, we identified AMPK as a direct target of 4-HNE adduction resulting in inhibition of both H2O2 and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR)-induced downstream signaling. By employing biotin hydrazide capture, it was confirmed that 4-HNE treatment of cells resulted in carbonylation of AMPKα/β, which was not observed in untreated cells. Using a murine model of alcoholic liver disease, treatment with high concentrations of ethanol resulted in an increase in phosphorylated as well as carbonylated AMPKα. Despite increased AMPK phosphorylation, there was no significant change in phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase. Mass spectrometry identified Michael addition adducts of 4-HNE on Cys(130), Cys(174), Cys(227), and Cys(304) on recombinant AMPKα and Cys(225) on recombinant AMPKβ. Molecular modeling analysis of identified 4-HNE adducts on AMPKα suggest that inhibition of AMPK occurs by steric hindrance of the active site pocket and by inhibition of hydrogen peroxide induced oxidation. The observed inhibition of AMPK by 4-HNE provides a novel mechanism for altered β-oxidation in ALD, and these data demonstrate for the first time that AMPK is subject to regulation by reactive aldehydes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2081926343,"Axon Routing in the Olfactory System The olfactory system of mice entails a developmental program that wires neurons expressing similar olfactory receptors into glomeruli together. Although the adult olfactory system continues to produce and incorporate new neurons, it cannot withstand severe damage (see the Perspective by Cheetham and Belluscio ). Ma et al. (p. 194 ) and Tsai and Barnea (p. 197 ) examined the difference in responses between early development and adulthood. Manipulating the expression of an odorant receptor or the activity of the olfactory neurons altered olfactory neuron axonal pathfinding. The results suggest that the guidance systems used differ between early development and adulthood: Early axons find their own way, but later-in-life axons can only follow existing pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1986540754,"Tangling Evolutionary Trees Evolutionary rates tend to vary among taxa and may result in phylogenetic trees that do not reflect the true relationships among taxa, depending on the sequences input into the analysis. Examining vertebrate trees, Evans et al. (p. 200 ) demonstrate that differences in evolutionary rates, leading to phylogenetic distortions, are correlated with the mechanisms underlying germ cell formation. Evolutionary rate is faster in cases where germ cells are established by maternal molecules (“preformed”) relative to those that are induced during embryogenesis (“epigenesis”) in slowly evolving and, presumably, ancestral lineages. For example, frogs evolve more rapidly than salamanders, and teleosts more rapidly than ascipenseriform fishes. Thus, epigenesis constrains the ability of gene regulatory networks to change, with the repeated and convergent evolution of preformation eliminating this constraint."
https://openalex.org/W2147717944,"Thyrotropin (TSH) activation of the TSH receptor (TSHR), a 7-transmembrane-spanning receptor (7TMR), may have osteoprotective properties by direct effects on bone. TSHR activation by TSH phosphorylates protein kinases AKT1, p38α, and ERK1/2 in some cells. We found TSH-induced phosphorylation of these kinases in 2 cell lines engineered to express TSHRs, human embryonic kidney HEK-TSHR cells and human osteoblastic U2OS-TSHR cells. In U2OS-TSHR cells, TSH up-regulated pAKT1 (7.1±0.5-fold), p38α (2.9±0.4-fold), and pERK1/2 (3.1±0.2-fold), whereas small molecule TSHR agonist C2 had no or little effect on pAKT1 (1.8±0.08-fold), p38α (1.2±0.09-fold), and pERK1/2 (1.6±0.19-fold). Furthermore, TSH increased expression of osteoblast marker genes ALPL (8.2±4.6-fold), RANKL (21±5.9-fold), and osteopontin (OPN; 17±5.3-fold), whereas C2 had little effect (ALPL, 1.7±0.5-fold; RANKL, 1.3±0.6-fold; and OPN, 2.2±0.7-fold). β-Arrestin-1 and -2 can mediate activatory signals by 7TMRs. TSH stimulated translocation of β-arrestin-1 and -2 to TSHR, whereas C2 failed to translocate either β-arrestin. Down-regulation of β-arrestin-1 by siRNA inhibited TSH-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38α, and AKT1, whereas down-regulation of β-arrestin-2 increased phosphorylation of AKT1 in both cell types and of ERK1/2 in HEK-TSHR cells. Knockdown of β-arrestin-1 inhibited TSH-stimulated up-regulation of mRNAs for OPN by 87 ± 1.7% and RANKL by 73 ± 2.4%, and OPN secretion by 74 ± 10%. We conclude that TSH enhances osteoblast differentiation in U2OS cells that is, in part, caused by activatory signals mediated by β-arrestin-1."

https://openalex.org/W2094105411,"The terpene compounds represent the largest and most diverse class of plant secondary metabolites which are important in plant growth and development. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR; EC 1.1.1.34) is one of the key enzymes contributed to terpene biosynthesis. To better understand the basic characteristics and evolutionary history of the HMGR gene family in plants, a genome-wide analysis of HMGR genes from 20 representative species was carried out. A total of 56 HMGR genes in the 14 land plant genomes were identified, but no genes were found in all 6 algal genomes. The gene structure and protein architecture of all plant HMGR genes were highly conserved. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the plant HMGRs were derived from one ancestor gene and finally developed into four distinct groups, two in the monocot plants and two in dicot plants. Species-specific gene duplications, caused mainly by segmental duplication, led to the limited expansion of HMGR genes in Zea mays, Gossypium raimondii, Populus trichocarpa and Glycine max after the species diverged. The analysis of Ka/Ks ratios and expression profiles indicated that functional divergence after the gene duplications was restricted. The results suggested that the function and evolution of HMGR gene family were dramatically conserved throughout the plant kingdom."
https://openalex.org/W1980506976,"The guanosine 3',5'-bisdiphosphate (ppGpp) signaling system is shared by bacteria and plant chloroplasts, but its role in plants has remained unclear. Here we show that guanylate kinase (GK), a key enzyme in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis that catalyzes the conversion of GMP to GDP, is a target of regulation by ppGpp in chloroplasts of rice, pea, and Arabidopsis. Plants have two distinct types of GK that are localized to organelles (GKpm) or to the cytosol (GKc), with both enzymes being essential for growth and development. We found that the activity of rice GKpm in vitro was inhibited by ppGpp with a Ki of 2.8 μM relative to the substrate GMP, whereas the Km of this enzyme for GMP was 73 μM. The IC50 of ppGpp for GKpm was ∼10 μM. In contrast, the activity of rice GKc was insensitive to ppGpp, as was that of GK from bakers' yeast, which is also a cytosolic enzyme. These observations suggest that ppGpp plays a pivotal role in the regulation of GTP biosynthesis in chloroplasts through specific inhibition of GKpm activity, with the regulation of GTP biosynthesis in chloroplasts thus being independent of that in the cytosol. We also found that GKs of Escherichia coli and Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 are insensitive to ppGpp, in contrast to the ppGpp sensitivity of the Bacillus subtilis enzyme. Our biochemical characterization of GK enzymes has thus revealed a novel target of ppGpp in chloroplasts and has uncovered diversity among bacterial GKs with regard to regulation by ppGpp."

Tasty Sweet (susceptible) and Ambrozja (relatively resistant) cultivars infested with one of two hemipteran species, namely monophagous Sitobion avenae F. (grain aphid) or oligophagous Rhopalosiphum padi L. (bird cherry-oat aphid). Secondarily, aphid-elicited alternations in the antioxidative capacity towards DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical in insect-stressed plants were evaluated. Comprehensive comparison of expression profiles of the four sod genes showed that both insect species evoked significant upregulation of three genes sod2, sod3.4 and sod9). However, aphid infestation affected non-significant fluctuations in expression of sodB gene in seedlings of both maize genotypes. The highest levels of transcript accumulation occurred at 8 h (sod2 and sod3.4) or 24 h (sod9) post-infestation, and aphid-induced changes in the expression of sod genes were more dramatic in the Ambrozja cultivar than in the Tasty Sweet variety. Furthermore, bird cherry-oat aphid colonization had a more substantial impact on levels of DPPH radical scavenging activity in infested host seedlings than grain aphid colonization. Additionally, Ambrozja plants infested by either hemipteran species showed markedly lower antioxidative capacity compared with attacked Tasty Sweet plants."
https://openalex.org/W2005311884,"The HIV-1 Nef virulence factor interacts with multiple host cell-signaling proteins. Nef binds to the Src homology 3 domains of Src family kinases, resulting in kinase activation important for viral infectivity, replication, and MHC-I down-regulation. Itk and other Tec family kinases are also present in HIV target cells, and Itk has been linked to HIV-1 infectivity and replication. However, the molecular mechanism linking Itk to HIV-1 is unknown. In this study, we explored the interaction of Nef with Tec family kinases using a cell-based bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. In this approach, interaction of Nef with a partner kinase juxtaposes nonfluorescent YFP fragments fused to the C terminus of each protein, resulting in YFP complementation and a bright fluorescent signal. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation, we observed that Nef interacts with the Tec family members Bmx, Btk, and Itk but not Tec or Txk. Interaction with Nef occurs through the kinase Src homology 3 domains and localizes to the plasma membrane. Allelic variants of Nef from all major HIV-1 subtypes interacted strongly with Itk in this assay, demonstrating the highly conserved nature of this interaction. A selective small molecule inhibitor of Itk kinase activity (BMS-509744) potently blocked wild-type HIV-1 infectivity and replication, but not that of a Nef-defective mutant. Nef induced constitutive Itk activation in transfected cells that was sensitive to inhibitor treatment. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that Nef interacts with cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of the Tec family and suggest that Nef provides a mechanistic link between HIV-1 and Itk signaling in the viral life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2048152249,"Wolbachia are widespread endosymbiotic bacteria of arthropods and nematodes. Studies on such models suggest that Wolbachia's remarkable aptitude to infect offspring may rely on a re-infection of ovaries from somatic tissues instead of direct cellular segregation between oogonia and oocytes. In the terrestrial isopod Armadillidium vulgare, Wolbachia are vertically transmitted to the host offspring, even though ovary cells are cyclically renewed. Using Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we showed that the proportion of infected oocytes increased in the course of ovary and oocyte maturation, starting with 31.5% of infected oocytes only. At the end of ovary maturation, this proportion reached 87.6% for the most mature oocytes, which is close to the known transmission rate to offspring. This enrichment can be explained by a secondary acquisition of the bacteria by oocytes (Wolbachia can be seen as last minute passengers) and/or by a preferential selection of oocytes infected with Wolbachia (as priority travellers)."

https://openalex.org/W1994544014,"Genetic recombination is considered to be a very frequent phenomenon among enteroviruses (Family Picornaviridae, Genus Enterovirus). However, the recombination patterns may differ between enterovirus species and between types within species. Enterovirus C (EV-C) species contains 21 types. In the capsid coding P1 region, the types of EV-C species cluster further into three sub-groups (designated here as A–C). In this study, the recombination pattern of EV-C species sub-group B that contains types CVA-21, CVA-24, EV-C95, EV-C96 and EV-C99 was determined using partial 5′UTR and VP1 sequences of enterovirus strains isolated during poliovirus surveillance and previously published complete genome sequences. Several inter-typic recombination events were detected. Furthermore, the analyses suggested that inter-typic recombination events have occurred mainly within the distinct sub-groups of EV-C species. Only sporadic recombination events between EV-C species sub-group B and other EV-C sub-groups were detected. In addition, strict recombination barriers were inferred for CVA-21 genotype C and CVA-24 variant strains. These results suggest that the frequency of inter-typic recombinations, even within species, may depend on the phylogenetic position of the given viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1965265964,"Objective To assess in a high-resolution model of thin liver rat slices which viscoelastic parameter at three-dimensional multifrequency MR elastography has the best diagnostic performance for quantifying liver fibrosis. Materials and Methods The study was approved by the ethics committee for animal care of our institution. Eight normal rats and 42 rats with carbon tetrachloride induced liver fibrosis were used in the study. The rats were sacrificed, their livers were resected and three-dimensional MR elastography of 5±2 mm liver slices was performed at 7T with mechanical frequencies of 500, 600 and 700 Hz. The complex shear, storage and loss moduli, and the coefficient of the frequency power law were calculated. At histopathology, fibrosis and inflammation were assessed with METAVIR score, fibrosis was further quantified with morphometry. The diagnostic value of the viscoelastic parameters for assessing fibrosis severity was evaluated with simple and multiple linear regressions, receiver operating characteristic analysis and Obuchowski measures. Results At simple regression, the shear, storage and loss moduli were associated with the severity of fibrosis. At multiple regression, the storage modulus at 600 Hz was the only parameter associated with fibrosis severity (r = 0.86, p<0.0001). This parameter had an Obuchowski measure of 0.89+/−0.03. This measure was significantly larger than that of the loss modulus (0.78+/−0.04, p = 0.028), but not than that of the complex shear modulus (0.88+/−0.03, p = 0.84). Conclusion Our high resolution, three-dimensional multifrequency MR elastography study of thin liver slices shows that the storage modulus is the viscoelastic parameter that has the best association with the severity of liver fibrosis. However, its diagnostic performance does not differ significantly from that of the complex shear modulus."
https://openalex.org/W2088585910,"Recent evidence suggests that specific extracellular α-synuclein (α-syn) strains are implicated in the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology. It is plausible that deregulation in the normal processing of secreted α-syn may be a causative risk factor for PD. To date, the degradation mechanisms involved have received very little attention. Here, we sought to investigate factors that regulate extracellular α-syn levels. We show, for the first time, that cell-secreted α-syn forms are resistant to direct proteolysis by kallikrein-related peptidase 6 (KLK6), an extracellular enzyme known to cleave recombinant α-syn. This differential susceptibility appears to be partially due to the association of secreted α-syn with lipids. We further provide evidence that secreted α-syn can be cleaved by KLK6 indirectly through activation of a secreted metalloprotease, suggestive of the involvement of a proteolytic cascade in the catabolism of secreted α-syn. Our results clearly suggest that physiological modifications affect the biochemical behavior of secreted α-syn and provide novel insights into mechanisms and potential targets for therapeutic interventions.-Ximerakis, M., Pampalakis, G., Roumeliotis, T.

https://openalex.org/W2060410841,"Objective Formaldehyde is still widely employed as a universal crosslinking agent, preservative and disinfectant, despite its proven carcinogenicity in occupationally exposed workers. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to understand the possible impact of low-dose formaldehyde exposures in the general population. Due to the concomitant occurrence of multiple indoor and outdoor toxicants, we tested how formaldehyde, at micromolar concentrations, interferes with general DNA damage recognition and excision processes that remove some of the most frequently inflicted DNA lesions. Methodology/Principal Findings The overall mobility of the DNA damage sensors UV-DDB (ultraviolet-damaged DNA-binding) and XPC (xeroderma pigmentosum group C) was analyzed by assessing real-time protein dynamics in the nucleus of cultured human cells exposed to non-cytotoxic (<100 μM) formaldehyde concentrations. The DNA lesion-specific recruitment of these damage sensors was tested by monitoring their accumulation at local irradiation spots. DNA repair activity was determined in host-cell reactivation assays and, more directly, by measuring the excision of DNA lesions from chromosomes. Taken together, these assays demonstrated that formaldehyde obstructs the rapid nuclear trafficking of DNA damage sensors and, consequently, slows down their relocation to DNA damage sites thus delaying the excision repair of target lesions. A concentration-dependent effect relationship established a threshold concentration of as low as 25 micromolar for the inhibition of DNA excision repair. Conclusions/Significance A main implication of the retarded repair activity is that low-dose formaldehyde may exert an adjuvant role in carcinogenesis by impeding the excision of multiple mutagenic base lesions. In view of this generally disruptive effect on DNA repair, we propose that formaldehyde exposures in the general population should be further decreased to help reducing cancer risks."
https://openalex.org/W2047035998,"Background The European earwig (Forficula auricularia) is an established system for studies of sexual selection, social interactions and the evolution of parental care. Despite its scientific interest, little knowledge exists about the species at the genomic level, limiting the scope of molecular studies and expression analyses of genes of interest. To overcome these limitations, we sequenced and validated the transcriptome of the European earwig. Methodology and Principal Findings To obtain a comprehensive transcriptome, we sequenced mRNA from various tissues and developmental stages of female and male earwigs using Roche 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina HiSeq. The reads were de novo assembled independently and screened for possible microbial contamination and repeated elements. The remaining contigs were combined into a hybrid assembly and clustered to reduce redundancy. A comparison with the eukaryotic core gene dataset indicates that we sequenced a substantial part of the earwig transcriptome with a low level of fragmentation. In addition, a comparative analysis revealed that more than 8,800 contigs of the hybrid assembly show significant similarity to insect-specific proteins and those were assigned for Gene Ontology terms. Finally, we established a quantitative PCR test for expression stability using commonly used housekeeping genes and applied the method to five homologs of known sex-biased genes of the honeybee. The qPCR pilot study confirmed sex specific expression and also revealed significant expression differences between the brain and antenna tissue samples. Conclusions By employing two different sequencing approaches and including samples obtained from different tissues, developmental stages, and sexes, we were able to assemble a comprehensive transcriptome of F. auricularia. The transcriptome presented here offers new opportunities to study the molecular bases and evolution of parental care and sociality in arthropods."

Alcohol drinking has been identified as a major environmental risk-factor related to ESCC. The alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) family are major enzymes involved in the alcohol-metabolizing pathways, including alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) and ADH1C. Interestingly, ADH1B and ADH1C genes locate tandemly with ADH7 in a genomic segment as a gene cluster, and are all polymorphic. Several ESCC susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ADH1B-ADH1C-ADH7 cluster have been identified previously through a genome-wide association study (GWAS). In the study, we examined the association between five ADH1B-ADH1C-ADH7 cluster SNPs (rs1042026, rs17033, rs1614972, rs1789903 and rs17028973) and risk of developing ESCC. Genotypes were determined in two independent case-control sets from two regions of China. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by logistic regression.

https://openalex.org/W1980338109,"Dynamics of cropland soil organic carbon (SOC) in response to different management practices and environmental conditions across North China Plain (NCP) were studied using a modeling approach. We identified the key variables driving SOC changes at a high spatial resolution (10 km×10 km) and long time scale (90 years). The model used future climatic data from the FGOALS model based on four future greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration scenarios. Agricultural practices included different rates of nitrogen (N) fertilization, manure application, and stubble retention. We found that SOC change was significantly influenced by the management practices of stubble retention (linearly positive), manure application (linearly positive) and nitrogen fertilization (nonlinearly positive) – and the edaphic variable of initial SOC content (linearly negative). Temperature had weakly positive effects, while precipitation had negligible impacts on SOC dynamics under current irrigation management. The effects of increased N fertilization on SOC changes were most significant between the rates of 0 and 300 kg ha−1 yr−1. With a moderate rate of manure application (i.e., 2000 kg ha−1 yr−1), stubble retention (i.e., 50%), and an optimal rate of nitrogen fertilization (i.e., 300 kg ha−1 yr−1), more than 60% of the study area showed an increase in SOC, and the average SOC density across NCP was relatively steady during the study period. If the rates of manure application and stubble retention doubled (i.e., manure application rate of 4000 kg ha−1 yr−1 and stubble retention rate of 100%), soils across more than 90% of the study area would act as a net C sink, and the average SOC density kept increasing from 40 Mg ha−1 during 2010s to the current worldwide average of ∼55 Mg ha−1 during 2060s. The results can help target agricultural management practices for effectively mitigating climate change through soil C sequestration."

There is growing appreciation that G proteins are also present at endomembrane compartments, where they can potentially interact with a distinct set of signaling proteins. Here, we examine the cellular trafficking function of the G protein α subunit in yeast, Gpa1. Gpa1 contains a unique 109-amino acid insert within the α-helical domain that undergoes a variety of posttranslational modifications. Among these is monoubiquitination, catalyzed by the NEDD4 family ubiquitin ligase Rsp5.

Gα proteins are enzymatic switches that are part of a multicomponent signaling complex. The complex typically consists of a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor, a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gα), and an associated dimer consisting of β and γ subunits (Gβγ) (1Sprang S.R. G protein mechanisms: insights from structural analysis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Signaling is turned on and off based on receptor activation, which in turn dictates the nucleotide-bound state of the Gα protein. When Gα is GDP-bound, Gβγ is sequestered, and signaling pathways are off (1Sprang S.R. G protein mechanisms: insights from structural analysis.Annu. Rev.

Yeast as a model system for studying endocytosis.Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For Ste2 this process is mediated in part by endocytic adaptor proteins containing a ubiquitin binding domain (UBD) (21Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L.

Although structurally diverse, UBDs share the ability to bind non-covalently to ubiquitin-conjugated substrates and serve to transport monoubiquitinated proteins through the various stages of endocytosis (23Husnjak K. Dikic I. Ubiquitin-binding proteins: decoders of ubiquitin-mediated cellular functions.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 291-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Although the general process of monoubiquitination-mediated endocytosis is well understood, questions remain concerning the specific protein components that are important for trafficking of the G protein. The yeast model system, in which many ubiquitination and cellular trafficking components were originally identified, can facilitate understanding of the interconnections between G protein signaling, monoubiquitination, and trafficking (24Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Regulation of G protein initiated signal transduction in yeast: paradigms and principles.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Pheromone binds to Ste2, which is coupled to Gpa1 (Gα) and Ste4/Ste18 (Gβγ). When Gα is activated, Gβγ dissociates and stimulates a kinase cascade leading to activation of the yeast MAPK Fus3. A second branch of the pathway leads to activation of a Rho family GTPase, Cdc42 (24Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Regulation of G protein initiated signal transduction in yeast: paradigms and principles.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Together these processes result in cell cycle arrest, new gene transcription, and morphological changes that facilitate mating (24Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Regulation of G protein initiated signal transduction in yeast: paradigms and principles.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Pheromone pathway signaling is attenuated by the pheromone-dependent monoubiquitination and endocytosis of the G protein-coupled receptor Ste2 (16Hicke L. Riezman H. Ubiquitination of a yeast plasma membrane receptor signals its ligand-stimulated endocytosis.Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). As with the receptor, monoubiquitination leads to the endocytosis and eventual vacuolar degradation of Gpa1 (25Wang Y. Marotti Jr., L.A. Lee M.J. Dohlman H.G.

In contrast to Ste2, monoubiquitination of Gpa1 is not dependent on pheromone stimulation. Both proteins are monoubiquitinated by the same ubiquitin ligase, Rsp5 (26Torres M.P. Lee M.J. Ding F.

Although the Ras-like and α-helical domains are highly conserved across species, Gpa1 possesses a unique 109-amino acid insert (ubiquitination domain (UD)) within the α-helical domain. The UD contains the known sites of phosphorylation as well as the primary residue for both monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination (25Wang Y. Marotti Jr., L.A. Lee M.J. Dohlman H.G.

Given that the α-helical domain modulates the activity of some G proteins, we considered whether the UD could influence the activity as well as the cellular distribution of Gpa1. Here we show that the UD does not influence G protein catalytic activity or downstream MAPK signaling but is needed for proper trafficking of Gpa1 to the vacuole. Our screen of 39 gene deletion mutations revealed seven UBD-containing proteins that are required for Gpa1 trafficking. Four of these proteins are required for trafficking of Gpa1 but not Ste2, thus demonstrating that constitutive endocytosis of these proteins occurs by distinct mechanisms. Finally, we show that Gα endocytosis from the plasma membrane is required for sustained cellular morphogenesis and efficient mating. Standard procedures were followed for the growth, maintenance, and transformation of yeast and bacteria. Proteins for biochemical studies were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) RIPL cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) grown at 18 °C overnight after induction with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The yeast (S. cerevisiae) strain used in this study was BY4741 (MATa leu2Δ met15Δ his3-1 ura3Δ) and its derivatives. Cells were grown at 30 °C in yeast extract peptone medium or synthetic complete medium containing 2% (w/v) dextrose. The gpa1ΔUD mutant strain was generated by transformation of AflII-digested pRS406-GPA1_truncΔUD in wild type cells. In each case transformed cells were grown in synthetic complete medium that lacked the appropriate nutrient or yeast extract peptone medium with the appropriate drug. Both the native (scGpa1) and codon-optimized Gpa1 (coGpa1) were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pQlinkH (Addgene), which contains an N-terminal tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease-cleavable His6 tag, using the BamHI and NotI restriction sites. Efficient TEV protease cleavage required the use of Gpa1ΔN lacking the first 38 amino acids, which are predicted to be unstructured based on alignment with Gαi (32Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Structures of active conformations of Giα1 and the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis.Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). pQlinkH-GPA1ΔNΔUD was constructed by deleting the coding sequence corresponding to amino acids 128–236 from the pQlinkH-GPA1ΔN plasmid. The pRS406-STE2-GFP integrating vector was constructed by PCR amplification of ∼900 base pairs from the 3′ end of STE2 in-frame with GFP from the yeast GFP strain collection (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA from the above strain was amplified with flanking KpnI and SacI sites for introduction to pRS406. The pRS406-GPA1_truncΔUD integrating vector was constructed by PCR amplification of GPA1ΔUD from pRS406-GPA1ΔUD-GFP minus the first 81 base pairs of GPA1. The PCR product was flanked by XbaI and SacI sites for introduction to pRS406. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce a silent mutation at bp 181 to generate an AflII site for integration. Construction of the pRS406-GPA1-GFP, pRS406-GPA1ΔUD-GFP, pRS423-FUS1-lacZ, and pADM4-GPA1 vectors has been described previously (25Wang Y. Marotti Jr., L.A. Lee M.J. Dohlman H.G.

Generating the quantities of pure Gpa1 necessary to complete biophysical studies has been a barrier to progress both because of low initial protein expression and impurities, necessitating additional purification steps. We optimized the process using small-scale batch purification and TEV protease-cleavage to release protein from the nickel beads (Table 1). E. coli were lysed by homogenization (NanoDeBee) at 1000 p.s.i. in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 300 mm KCl and 250 μm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. After clarification by centrifugation, the lysate from 500 ml of cell culture was bound to 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose bead slurry (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for 20 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times at 4 °C with 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 300 mm KCl, then 3 times with Gpa1 buffer (25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 100 mm KCl) with 100 μm GDP and 500 μm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Gpa1 was cleaved from the beads by incubation at 4 °C overnight with 500 μg of TEV protease. The final product was judged >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. Protein was stored at 4 °C (never frozen) and used within 2 days. Although the use of TEV protease cleavage to release Gpa1 decreased the yield from the first purification step (about half of the Gpa1 remains on the beads), this loss in efficiency is mitigated by the increase in purity (does not require further dialysis or purification steps). Furthermore, we found that 46% of the codons in Gpa1 are rarely used in E. coli, which can significantly reduce the efficiency of expression (35Clarke 4th, T.F. Clark P.L. Rare codons cluster.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A codon-optimized Gpa1 yielded 18 mg/liter, an increase of 11-fold over the original method.TABLE 1Optimization of Gpa1 purificationConstructInductionPurificationPuritymg/lscGpa1+Column<25%1.6scGpa1+Batch∼50%10.4scGpa1+Batch with TEVNDNDscGpa1ΔN++Batch with TEV>90%4.6coGpa1ΔN++++Batch with TEV>90%18 Open table in a new tab Gpa1 was diluted to 5 μm in Gpa1 buffer with 50 μm GDP, 50 μm MgCl2, and 550 μm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Spectra were recorded from 190 to 260 nm on a Chirascan plus CD spectrometer at 25 °C using a 1-mm quartz cell. Buffer background was subtracted from the spectra. Gpa1ΔN was diluted to 2 μm in Gpa1 buffer with 50 μm GDP or GTPγS. Protein sample was mixed with 4-fluoro-7-aminosulfonylbenzoflurazan (ABD-F, Anaspec) on ice (final concentration, 2 mm). 20-μl aliquots of the sample were reacted for 3 min at either 42 °C or 70 °C and then transferred to ice to quench ABD-F labeling. Samples were prepared for mass spectrometry and analyzed as described by Isom et al. (36Isom D.G. Sridharan V. Baker R. Clement S.T. Smalley D.M. Dohlman H.G.

Data collected on a Nano-Acquity HPLC solvent delivery system (Waters Corp.) connected through an electrospray ionization source interfaced to an LTQ Orbitrap Velos ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp.). The fast quantitative cysteine reactivity method (37Isom D.G. Marguet P.R. Oas T.G. Hellinga H.W. A miniaturized technique for assessing protein thermodynamics and function using fast determination of quantitative cysteine reactivity.Proteins. 2011; 79: 1034-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was employed to measure Gpa1 thermal stability. Briefly, 2 μm protein was incubated with 1 mm ABD-F in Gpa1 buffer in the presence of 20 μm GDP or GTPγS and 2 mm MgCl2 at the desired temperature for 3 min. The reaction was quenched with 20 mm HCl (final concentration), and ABD-F fluorescence was measured on a PHERAstar plate reader (BMG Labtech, excitation at 400 nm and emission at 500 nm). The data were normalized and fit using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software; San Diego, CA) to determine the temperature at which half the protein was unfolded, representing the melting temperature (Tm). Purified Gpa1 was exchanged into Gpa1 buffer with 50 μm MgCl2 and 100 μm GDP. To initiate association, 1 μm 2′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-guanosine 5′-diphosphate (MANT-GDP) was added to 1 μm protein at room temperature. Gpa1 was determined to be fully loaded when the fluorescence intensity reached a maximum (∼250 s). Association was measured as a change in fluorescence intensity over time (excitation, 360 nm; emission, 440 nm) using a LS50B PerkinElmer Life Sciences Luminescence Spectrometer. MANT-GDP dissociation was initiated by the addition of 500 μm unlabeled GDP. Fluorescence data were fit in GraphPad Prism to a one-phase exponential association or decay curve. Purified Gpa1 (200 nm) was equilibrated to room temperature in Gpa1 buffer with 50 μm MgCl2. GTP at a final concentration of 200 nm was added, and GTP binding and hydrolysis were monitored by the change in intrinsic fluorescence of Gpa1 that occurs upon rearrangement of the tryptophan near the nucleotide binding region (excitation at 284 nm and emission at 340 nm) using a LS50B PerkinElmer Life Sciences Luminescence Spectrometer. Data were fit to exponential association or dissociation curves using GraphPad Prism. BY4741-derived mutants lacking specific ubiquitin binding domain-containing proteins (disrupted using the KanMX G418 resistance marker, from Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) were used for the screen. PEP4 was disrupted in the deletion mutant strains by single-step gene replacement with pep4::HIS3 using PCR-mediated gene disruption (38Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P.

GPA1-GFP was introduced in each strain by transformation of pRS406-GPA1-GFP after digestion with HindIII (25Wang Y. Marotti Jr., L.A. Lee M.J. Dohlman H.G.

Separately, STE2-GFP was introduced in the deletion mutants by transformation of pRS406-STE2-GFP (this study) after digestion with AfeI. Screen hits (deletion mutants that mislocalized Gpa1-GFP) were re-made in BY4741 and BY4741-derived strains by gene replacement with KanMX4 using PCR and pFA6KanMX as the template (39Wach A.

All deletions were verified by PCR and nucleotide sequence analysis and analyzed for Gpa1-GFP localization. Pheromone sensitivity was measured by a transcriptional reporter assay (33Hoffman G.A. Garrison T.R. Dohlman H.G. Analysis of RGS proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) as described earlier. Briefly, cells transformed with pRS423 FUS1-LacZ were stimulated with different concentrations of pheromone for 90 min. β-Galactosidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically (750 nm) using fluorescein di-β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate. Yeast cells either untreated or treated with 3 μm α-factor for 30 min were harvested in trichloroacetic acid (TCA, 5% final concentration), centrifuged, washed with 10 mm NaN3, and pellets were frozen at −80 °C. Cell extracts were prepared by glass bead lysis in TCA as previously described (40Lee M.J. Dohlman H.G.

Protein concentrations were determined by a Bradford colorimetric protein assay (Bio-Rad). 25 μg of protein (40 μg to evaluate Gpa1 ubiquitination) was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by immunoblotting with antibodies for phospho-p44/42 MAPK at 1:500 (9101L; Cell Signaling Technology), Fus3 at 1:500 (sc-6773; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), G6PDH at 1:50,000 (A9521, Sigma), and Gpa1 at 1:1,000 (41Dohlman H.G.

https://openalex.org/W2147390945,"Embedded in the plasma membrane of all bacteria, ATP binding cassette (ABC) importers facilitate the uptake of several vital nutrients and cofactors. The ABC transporter, MolBC-A, imports molybdate by passing substrate from the binding protein MolA to a membrane-spanning translocation pathway of MolB. To understand the mechanism of transport in the biological membrane as a whole, the effects of the lipid bilayer on transport needed to be addressed. Continuous wave-electron paramagnetic resonance and in vivo molybdate uptake studies were used to test the impact of the lipid environment on the mechanism and function of MolBC-A. Working with the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae, we found that MolBC-A functions as a low affinity molybdate transporter in its native environment. In periods of high extracellular molybdate concentration, H. influenzae makes use of parallel molybdate transport systems (MolBC-A and ModBC-A) to take up a greater amount of molybdate than a strain with ModBC-A alone. In addition, the movement of the translocation pathway in response to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis in a lipid environment is conserved when compared with in-detergent analysis. However, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy indicates that a lipid environment restricts the flexibility of the MolBC translocation pathway. By combining continuous wave-electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and substrate uptake studies, we reveal details of molybdate transport and the logistics of uptake systems that employ multiple transporters for the same substrate, offering insight into the mechanisms of nutrient uptake in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2142131902,"Recent progress in the understanding of seven-transmembrane receptor (7TMR) signalling has promoted the development of a new generation of pathway selective ligands. The angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1aR) is one of the most studied 7TMRs with respect to selective activation of the β-arrestin dependent signalling. Two complimentary global phosphoproteomics studies have analyzed the complex signalling induced by the AT1aR. Here we integrate the data sets from these studies and perform a joint analysis using a novel method for prediction of differential kinase activity from phosphoproteomics data. The method builds upon NetworKIN, which applies sophisticated linear motif analysis in combination with contextual network modelling to predict kinase-substrate associations with high accuracy and sensitivity. These predictions form the basis for subsequently nonparametric statistical analysis to identify likely activated kinases. This suggested that AT1aR-dependent signalling activates 48 of the 285 kinases detected in HEK293 cells. Of these, Aurora B, CLK3 and PKG1 have not previously been described in the pathway whereas others, such as PKA, PKB and PKC, are well known. In summary, we have developed a new method for kinase-centric analysis of phosphoproteomes to pinpoint differential kinase activity in large-scale data sets."

Bone structural parameters generated by hip structural analysis may represent a separate measure of bone strength, but have not been assessed in HIV.Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans from 254 HIV-infected adults randomised to simplify their existing dual nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy to coformulated tenofovir-emtricitabine or abacavir-lamivudine were analysed using DXA-derived hip structural analysis software. Hip structural parameters included femoral strength index, section modulus, cross-sectional area, and cross-sectional moment of inertia. We used one-way ANOVA to test the relationship between nucleoside analogue type at baseline and structural parameters, multivariable analysis to assess baseline covariates associated with femoral strength index, and t-tests to compare mean change in structural parameters over 96 weeks between randomised groups.Participants taking tenofovir at baseline had lower section modulus (-107.3 mm2, p = 0.001), lower cross-sectional area (-15.01 mm3, p = 0.001), and lower cross-sectional moment of inertia (-2,036.8 mm4, p = 0.007) than those receiving other nucleoside analogues. After adjustment for baseline risk factors, the association remained significant for section modulus (p = 0.008) and cross-sectional area (p = 0.002). Baseline covariates significantly associated with higher femoral strength index were higher spine T-score (p = 0.001), lower body fat mass (p<0.001), lower bone alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.025), and higher osteoprotegerin (p = 0.024). Hip structural parameters did not change significantly over 96 weeks and none was significantly affected by treatment simplification to tenofovir-emtricitabine or abacavir-lamivudine.In this population, tenofovir use was associated with reduced composite indices of bone strength as measured by hip structural analysis, but none of the structural parameters improved significantly over 96 weeks with tenofovir cessation.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00192634."

The N-terminal domains (NTD) of these SSBs (responsible for their tetramerization and DNA binding) are structurally well defined. However, their C-terminal domains (CTD) possess undefined structures. EcoSSB NTD consists of β1-β1′-β2-β3-α-β4-β451-β452-β5 secondary structure elements. MtuSSB NTD includes an additional β-strand (β6) forming a novel hook-like structure. Recently, we observed that MtuSSB complemented an E. coli Δssb strain. However, a chimeric SSB (mβ4-β5), wherein only the terminal part of NTD (β4-β5 region possessing L45 loop) of EcoSSB was substituted with that from MtuSSB, failed to function in E. coli in spite of its normal DNA binding and oligomerization properties. Here, we designed new chimeras by transplanting selected regions of MtuSSB into EcoSSB to understand the functional significance of the various secondary structure elements within SSB. All chimeric SSBs formed homotetramers and showed normal DNA binding. The mβ4-β6 construct obtained by substitution of the region downstream of β5 in mβ4-β5 SSB with the corresponding region (β6) of MtuSSB complemented the E. coli strain indicating a functional interaction between the L45 loop and the β6 strand of MtuSSB."
