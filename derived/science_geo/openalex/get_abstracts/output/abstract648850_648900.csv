https://openalex.org/W3010131837,"Outbreak to pandemic In response to global dispersion of severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), quarantine measures have been implemented around the world. To understand how travel and quarantine influence the dynamics of the spread of this novel human virus, Chinazzi et al. applied a global metapopulation disease transmission model to epidemiological data from China. They concluded that the travel quarantine introduced in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 only delayed epidemic progression by 3 to 5 days within China, but international travel restrictions did help to slow spread elsewhere in the world until mid-February. Their results suggest that early detection, hand washing, self-isolation, and household quarantine will likely be more effective than travel restrictions at mitigating this pandemic.

https://openalex.org/W3009682272,"Summary Using untargeted metabolomics (n = 1,162 subjects), the plasma metabolite (m/z = 265.1188) phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln) was discovered and then shown in an independent cohort (n = 4,000 subjects) to be associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and incident major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death). A gut microbiota-derived metabolite, PAGln, was shown to enhance platelet activation-related phenotypes and thrombosis potential in whole blood, isolated platelets, and animal models of arterial injury. Functional and genetic engineering studies with human commensals, coupled with microbial colonization of germ-free mice, showed the microbial porA gene facilitates dietary phenylalanine conversion into phenylacetic acid, with subsequent host generation of PAGln and phenylacetylglycine (PAGly) fostering platelet responsiveness and thrombosis potential. Both gain- and loss-of-function studies employing genetic and pharmacological tools reveal PAGln mediates cellular events through G-protein coupled receptors, including α2A, α2B, and β2-adrenergic receptors. PAGln thus represents a new CVD-promoting gut microbiota-dependent metabolite that signals via adrenergic receptors. Video Abstract Download : Download video (36MB)"
https://openalex.org/W3009157977,"Cognitive dysfunction and reactive microglia are hallmarks of traumatic brain injury (TBI), yet whether these cells contribute to cognitive deficits and secondary inflammatory pathology remains poorly understood. Here, we show that removal of microglia from the mouse brain has little effect on the outcome of TBI, but inducing the turnover of these cells through either pharmacologic or genetic approaches can yield a neuroprotective microglial phenotype that profoundly aids recovery. The beneficial effects of these repopulating microglia are critically dependent on interleukin-6 (IL-6) trans-signaling via the soluble IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and robustly support adult neurogenesis, specifically by augmenting the survival of newborn neurons that directly support cognitive function. We conclude that microglia in the mammalian brain can be manipulated to adopt a neuroprotective and pro-regenerative phenotype that can aid repair and alleviate the cognitive deficits arising from brain injury."
https://openalex.org/W3009673357,"Human brain organoids provide unique platforms for modeling development and diseases by recapitulating the architecture of the embryonic brain. However, current organoid methods are limited by interior hypoxia and cell death due to insufficient surface diffusion, preventing generation of architecture resembling late developmental stages. Here, we report the sliced neocortical organoid (SNO) system, which bypasses the diffusion limit to prevent cell death over long-term cultures. This method leads to sustained neurogenesis and formation of an expanded cortical plate that establishes distinct upper and deep cortical layers for neurons and astrocytes, resembling the third trimester embryonic human neocortex. Using the SNO system, we further identify a critical role of WNT/β-catenin signaling in regulating human cortical neuron subtype fate specification, which is disrupted by a psychiatric-disorder-associated genetic mutation in patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived SNOs. These results demonstrate the utility of SNOs for investigating previously inaccessible human-specific, late-stage cortical development and disease-relevant mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W3009266182,"In response to transcription-blocking DNA damage, cells orchestrate a multi-pronged reaction, involving transcription-coupled DNA repair, degradation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), and genome-wide transcription shutdown. Here, we provide insight into how these responses are connected by the finding that ubiquitylation of RNAPII itself, at a single lysine (RPB1 K1268), is the focal point for DNA-damage-response coordination. K1268 ubiquitylation affects DNA repair and signals RNAPII degradation, essential for surviving genotoxic insult. RNAPII degradation results in a shutdown of transcriptional initiation, in the absence of which cells display dramatic transcriptome alterations. Additionally, regulation of RNAPII stability is central to transcription recovery-persistent RNAPII depletion underlies the failure of this process in Cockayne syndrome B cells. These data expose regulation of global RNAPII levels as integral to the cellular DNA-damage response and open the intriguing possibility that RNAPII pool size generally affects cell-specific transcription programs in genome instability disorders and even normal cells."
https://openalex.org/W3009694030,"Forward genetic screens with genome-wide CRISPR libraries are powerful tools for resolving cellular circuits and signaling pathways. Applying this technology to organoids, however, has been hampered by technical limitations. Here we report improved accuracy and robustness for pooled-library CRISPR screens by capturing sgRNA integrations in single organoids, substantially reducing required cell numbers for genome-scale screening. We applied our approach to wild-type and APC mutant human intestinal organoids to identify genes involved in resistance to TGF-β-mediated growth restriction, a key process during colorectal cancer progression, and validated hits including multiple subunits of the tumor-suppressive SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Mutations within these genes require concurrent inactivation of APC to promote TGF-β resistance and attenuate TGF-β target gene transcription. Our approach can be applied to a variety of assays and organoid types to facilitate biological discovery in primary 3D tissue models."
https://openalex.org/W3010469101,"A safe and controlled manipulation of endocytosis in vivo may have disruptive therapeutic potential. Here, we demonstrate that the anti-emetic/anti-psychotic prochlorperazine can be repurposed to reversibly inhibit the in vivo endocytosis of membrane proteins targeted by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, as directly demonstrated by our human tumor ex vivo assay. Temporary endocytosis inhibition results in enhanced target availability and improved efficiency of natural killer cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a mediator of clinical responses induced by IgG1 antibodies, demonstrated here for cetuximab, trastuzumab, and avelumab. Extensive analysis of downstream signaling pathways ruled out on-target toxicities. By overcoming the heterogeneity of drug target availability that frequently characterizes poorly responsive or resistant tumors, clinical application of reversible endocytosis inhibition may considerably improve the clinical benefit of ADCC-mediating therapeutic antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W3010047128,"Pulmonary tuberculosis, a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), manifests with a persistent cough as both a primary symptom and mechanism of transmission. The cough reflex can be triggered by nociceptive neurons innervating the lungs, and some bacteria produce neuron-targeting molecules. However, how pulmonary Mtb infection causes cough remains undefined, and whether Mtb produces a neuron-activating, cough-inducing molecule is unknown. Here, we show that an Mtb organic extract activates nociceptive neurons in vitro and identify the Mtb glycolipid sulfolipid-1 (SL-1) as the nociceptive molecule. Mtb organic extracts from mutants lacking SL-1 synthesis cannot activate neurons in vitro or induce cough in a guinea pig model. Finally, Mtb-infected guinea pigs cough in a manner dependent on SL-1 synthesis. Thus, we demonstrate a heretofore unknown molecular mechanism for cough induction by a virulent human pathogen via its production of a complex lipid."
https://openalex.org/W3009598951,"Early life environmental exposure, particularly during perinatal period, can have a life-long impact on organismal development and physiology. The biological rationale for this phenomenon is to promote physiological adaptations to the anticipated environment based on early life experience. However, perinatal exposure to adverse environments can also be associated with adult-onset disorders. Multiple environmental stressors induce glucocorticoids, which prompted us to investigate their role in developmental programming. Here, we report that perinatal glucocorticoid exposure had long-term consequences and resulted in diminished CD8 T cell response in adulthood and impaired control of tumor growth and bacterial infection. We found that perinatal glucocorticoid exposure resulted in persistent alteration of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Consequently, the level of the hormone in adults was significantly reduced, resulting in decreased CD8 T cell function. Our study thus demonstrates that perinatal stress can have long-term consequences on CD8 T cell immunity by altering HPA axis activity."
https://openalex.org/W3009607274,"Summary Neuroblastoma (NB), derived from the neural crest (NC), is the most common pediatric extracranial solid tumor. Here, we establish a platform that allows the study of human NBs in mouse-human NC chimeras. Chimeric mice were produced by injecting human NC cells carrying NB relevant oncogenes in utero into gastrulating mouse embryos. The mice developed tumors composed of a heterogenous cell population that resembled that seen in primary NBs of patients but were significantly different from homogeneous tumors formed in xenotransplantation models. The human tumors emerged in immunocompetent hosts and were extensively infiltrated by mouse cytotoxic T cells, reflecting a vigorous host anti-tumor immune response. However, the tumors blunted the immune response by inducing infiltration of regulatory T cells and expression of immune-suppressive molecules similar to escape mechanisms seen in human cancer patients. Thus, this experimental platform allows the study of human tumor initiation, progression, manifestation, and tumor-immune-system interactions in an animal model system."
https://openalex.org/W3009562358,"Cancer is believed to arise from stem cells, but mechanisms that limit the acquisition of mutations and tumor development have not been well defined. We show that a +4 stem cell (SC) in the gastric antrum, marked by expression of Cck2r (a GPCR) and Delta-like ligand 1 (DLL1), is a label-retaining cell that undergoes predominant asymmetric cell division. This +4 antral SC is Notch1low/ Numb+ and repressed by signaling from gastrin-expressing endocrine (G) cells. Chemical carcinogenesis of the stomach is associated with loss of G cells, increased symmetric stem cell division, glandular fission, and more rapid stem cell lineage tracing, a process that can be suppressed by exogenous gastrin treatment. This hormonal suppression is associated with a marked reduction in gastric cancer mutational load, as revealed by exomic sequencing. Taken together, our results show that gastric tumorigenesis is associated with increased symmetric cell division that facilitates mutation and is suppressed by GPCR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3010334882,"Keel bone fractures in laying hens have been described with increasing prevalence from several countries over the last twenty years and are considered one of the greatest welfare problems to the layer industry. In Denmark we have observed fracture prevalence in the range of 53% to 100% in flocks from cage-free systems whereas flock prevalences in birds from enriched cages ranged between 50–98%. Previous research have speculated that the underlying reason for the development of keel bone fractures is trauma in relation to impact of the bird with furniture, other equipment etc. However, little evidence of this theory has been provided. Predisposing factors have also been suggested including genetics of the bird, lack of specific feedstuff components, high egg production, management factors and layer fatigue. This study has addressed the possible pathogenesis of these fractures by pathological characterization of fractures in birds from different production systems. More than 60 keel bones with fractures have been characterized histo-pathologically and by CT scan. This included an assessment of damage to muscles and soft tissues, the bone and the healing process including callus formation. This investigation has shown that high energy collisions cannot be responsible for the majority of fractures, located at the caudal tip of the keel bone, observed in laying birds as markers associated trauma were not observed in the majority of the cases just as few recognized healing processes were observed. These results suggest an alternative pathogenesis to trauma."
https://openalex.org/W3012167905,"Objectives To identify predictive factors for falls in patients with bilateral vestibulopathy (BV). Specific variables contributing to the general work-up of a vestibular patient were compared between BV patients experiencing falls and those who did not. Design Prospective multi-centric cohort study. Setting Department of Otorhinolaryngology & Head and Neck Surgery at two tertiary referral centers: Antwerp University Hospital and Maastricht University Medical Center. Participants In total, 119 BV patients were included. BV diagnosis was defined in accordance with the diagnostic BV criteria, established by the Bárány Society in 2017. Main outcome measures Patients were divided into fallers and non-fallers, depending on the experience of one or more falls in the preceding 12 months. Residual vestibular function on caloric testing, rotatory chair testing, video head impulse test (vHIT) and cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP) was evaluated as a predictive factor for falls. Furthermore, hearing function (speech perception in noise (SPIN)), sound localization performance, etiology, disease duration, sport practice, scores on the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and the Oscillopsia Severity Questionnaire (OSQ) were compared between fallers and non-fallers. Results Forty-five (39%) patients reported falls. In a sub-analysis in the patients recruited at UZA (n = 69), 20% experienced three or more falls and three patients (4%) suffered from severe fall-related injuries. The DHI score and the OSQ score were significantly higher in fallers. Residual vestibular function, SPIN, sound localization performance, etiology, disease duration, age and sport practice did not differ between fallers and non-fallers. Conclusions Falls and (severe) fall-related injuries are frequent among BV patients. A DHI score > 47 and an OSQ score > 27.5 might be indicative for BV patients at risk for falls, with a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 60%. Residual vestibular function captured by single vestibular tests (vHIT, calorics, rotatory chair, cVEMP) or by overall vestibular function defined as the number of impaired vestibular sensors are not suitable to distinguish fallers and non-fallers in a BV population."
https://openalex.org/W3012332752,"Bacterial microcompartments (MCPs) are protein-based organelles that encapsulate metabolic pathways. Metabolic engineers have recently sought to repurpose MCPs to encapsulate heterologous pathways to increase flux through pathways of interest. As MCP engineering becomes more common, standardized methods for analyzing changes to MCPs and interpreting results across studies will become increasingly important. In this study, we demonstrate that different imaging techniques yield variations in the apparent size of purified MCPs from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2, likely due to variations in sample preparation methods. We provide guidelines for preparing samples for MCP imaging and outline expected variations in apparent size and morphology between methods. With this report we aim to establish an aid for comparing results across studies."
https://openalex.org/W3009396518,"Voluntary movement initiation involves the modulations of large groups of neurons in the primary motor cortex (M1). Yet similar modulations occur during movement planning when no movement occurs. Here, we show that a sequential spatiotemporal pattern of excitability propagates across M1 prior to the movement initiation in one of two oppositely oriented directions along the rostro-caudal axis. Using spatiotemporal patterns of intracortical microstimulation, we find that reaction time increases significantly when stimulation is delivered against, but not with, the natural propagation direction. Functional connections among M1 units emerge at movement that are oriented along the same rostro-caudal axis but not during movement planning. Finally, we show that beta amplitude profiles can more accurately decode muscle activity when they conform to the natural propagating patterns. These findings provide the first causal evidence that large-scale, propagating patterns of cortical excitability are behaviorally relevant and may be a necessary component of movement initiation."
https://openalex.org/W3010743520,"Very poor reclaimed soil quality and weak microbial activity occur in the reclamation area of a coal gangue landfill in the Loess Hills. The fourth and fifth years after farmland soil was reclaimed were studied, and the changes in and carbon source utilization characteristics of rhizosphere (R) and non-rhizosphere (S) soil microorganisms under organic and inorganic (OF), inorganic (F), and organic (O) fertilizer application and a control treatment (CK) in soybean (S) and maize (M) rotation systems were compared and analysed in Guljiao Tunlan, Shanxi Province, China. Biolog-EcoPlate technology was used to analyse the mechanism of soil characteristic change from the perspective of soil microbial metabolism function to provide a theoretical basis for reclamation and ecological reconstruction in this area. The average well colour development (AWCD) absorption and Shannon-Wiener index values of soybean and maize rhizosphere microorganisms were higher than those of non-rhizosphere microorganisms, and the mean value of the fertilizer treatment was higher than that for CK. Principal component analysis shows the main carbon sources that impact the functional diversity of the soybean rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil communities are a-cyclodextrin, a-D-lactose, ß-methyl D-glucoside, and glucose-1-phosphate and L-phenylalanine, while those for the maize rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil communities are D-cellobiose, glucose-1-phosphate, ß-methyl D-glucoside, methyl pyruvate, D-galactosate gamma lactone, D-mannitol, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, D-galactosalonic acid, and L-serine. The comprehensive utilization score of the non-rhizosphere soil carbon source in the maize season increased with respect to that in the soybean season, and the maximum increase was 1.09 under the OF treatment. Redundancy analysis showed that the soil nutrient factors driving the changes in the metabolic function diversity index values of the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil microbial communities in the different crop seasons in the reclamation area differed, but they were all related to the soil organic matter and available phosphorus. This may explain why OF treatment is the most beneficial to soil fertility under the rotation system in mining reclamation areas."
https://openalex.org/W3009813702,"To gain better insight into the regulatory networks of anthocyanin biosynthesis, an integrated analysis of the metabolome and transcriptome in purple and green leaves of Tetrastigma hemsleyanum was conducted. Transcript and metabolite profiles were archived by RNA-sequencing data analysis and LC-ESI-MS/MS, respectively. There were 209 metabolites and 4211 transcripts that were differentially expressed between purple and green leaves. Correlation tests of anthocyanin contents and transcriptional changes showed 141 significant correlations (Pearson correlation coefficient >0.8) between 16 compounds and 14 transcripts involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. Some novel genes and metabolites were discovered as potential candidate targets for the improvement of anthocyanin content and superior cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W3010420672,"Probiotic bacteria have the ability to modulate host immune responses and have potent therapeutic functional effects against several diseases, including inflammatory diseases. However, beneficial effects of probiotics are strain specific and their interactions with host immune cells to modulate inflammatory response are largely unknown. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), which are the first line of defense against invading pathogens, and connects between commensals/probiotics and immune system; therefore, in this study, we used human IECs to assess the probiotic effects of three selected Lactobacillus strains in vitro. An HT-29 colonic epithelial cell and HT-29/blood mononuclear cells co-culture system were stimulated with Lactobacillus followed by Salmonella for different hours, after which the mRNA level of cytokines, β-defensin-2 and negative regulators for TLR signaling and protein levels of ZO-1 and IκB-α were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. L. brevis decreased Salmonella induced IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and IL-1β levels, whereas L. pentosus suppressed IL-6 and MCP-1 in HT-29 cells. Moreover, L. brevis was able to increase the mRNA levels of A20, Tollip, SIGIRR and IRAKM, while L. pentosus reduced the levels of A20, and IRAKM in response to Salmonella. In addition, decrease in protein level of TNF-α and increase in mRNA level of IL-10 was observed in L. brevis and L. pentosus treated HT-29 cells. Lactobacillus strains were differentially modulated ZO-1 and p-IκB-α in HT-29 cells treated with Salmonella. Overall, the results of this study indicate that Lactobacillus strains attenuate Salmonella induced inflammatory responses through beneficial modulation of TLR negative regulators and the NF-κB pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3010657306,"Background We performed an exclusive study to investigate the associations between a total of 23 lactate-related indices during the first 24h in an intensive care unit (ICU) and in-hospital mortality. Methods Nine static and 14 dynamic lactate indices, including changes in lactate concentrations (Δ Lac) and slope (linear regression coefficient), were calculated from individual critically ill patient data extracted from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database. Results Data from a total of 781 ICU patients were extracted, consisted of 523 survivors and 258 non-survivors. The in-hospital mortality rate for this cohort was 33.0%. A multivariate logistic regression model identified maximal lactate concentration at 24h after ICU admission (max lactate at T24) as a significant predictor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio = 1.431, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.278–1.604, p<0.001) after adjusting for predefined confounders (age, gender, sepsis, Elixhauser comorbidity score, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, vasopressors, ICU severity scores). Area under curve (AUC) for max lactate at T24 was larger (AUC = 0.776, 95% CI = 0.740–0.812) than other indices (p<0.001), comparable to an APACHE III score of 0.771. When combining max lactate at T24 with APACHE III, the AUC was increased to 0.815 (95% CI:0.783–0.847). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the cut-off value of 3.05 mmol/L were 64.3%, 77.4%, 58.5%, and 81.5%, respectively. Kaplan-Myer survival curves of the max lactate at T24 for 90-day survival after admission to ICU demonstrated a significant difference according to the cut-off value (p<0.001). Conclusions These data indicate that the maximal arterial lactate concentration at T24 is a robust predictor of in-hospital mortality as well as 90-day survival in unselected ICU patients with predictive ability as comparable with APACHE III score."
https://openalex.org/W3010116366,"In diffusion MRI, the Ensemble Average diffusion Propagator (EAP) provides relevant micro-structural information and meaningful descriptive maps of the white matter previously obscured by traditional techniques like Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). The direct estimation of the EAP, however, requires a dense sampling of the Cartesian q-space involving a huge amount of samples (diffusion gradients) for proper reconstruction. A collection of more efficient techniques have been proposed in the last decade based on parametric representations of the EAP, but they still imply acquiring a large number of diffusion gradients with different b-values (shells). Paradoxically, this has come together with an effort to find scalar measures gathering all the q-space micro-structural information probed in one single index or set of indices. Among them, the return-to-origin (RTOP), return-to-plane (RTPP), and return-to-axis (RTAP) probabilities have rapidly gained popularity. In this work, we propose the so-called “Apparent Measures Using Reduced Acquisitions” (AMURA) aimed at computing scalar indices that can mimic the sensitivity of state of the art EAP-based measures to micro-structural changes. AMURA drastically reduces both the number of samples needed and the computational complexity of the estimation of diffusion properties by assuming the diffusion anisotropy is roughly independent from the radial direction. This simplification allows us to compute closed-form expressions from single-shell information, so that AMURA remains compatible with standard acquisition protocols commonly used even in clinical practice. Additionally, the analytical form of AMURA-based measures, as opposed to the iterative, non-linear reconstruction ubiquitous to full EAP techniques, turns the newly introduced apparent RTOP, RTPP, and RTAP both robust and efficient to compute."

https://openalex.org/W3009735491,"The visual system exploits multiple signals, including monocular and binocular cues, to determine the motion of objects through depth. In the laboratory, sensitivity to different three-dimensional (3D) motion cues varies across observers and is often weak for binocular cues. However, laboratory assessments may reflect factors beyond inherent perceptual sensitivity. For example, the appearance of weak binocular sensitivity may relate to extensive prior experience with two-dimensional (2D) displays in which binocular cues are not informative. Here we evaluated the impact of experience on motion-in-depth (MID) sensitivity in a virtual reality (VR) environment. We tested a large cohort of observers who reported having no prior VR experience and found that binocular cue sensitivity was substantially weaker than monocular cue sensitivity. As expected, sensitivity was greater when monocular and binocular cues were presented together than in isolation. Surprisingly, the addition of motion parallax signals appeared to cause observers to rely almost exclusively on monocular cues. As observers gained experience in the VR task, sensitivity to monocular and binocular cues increased. Notably, most observers were unable to distinguish the direction of MID based on binocular cues above chance level when tested early in the experiment, whereas most showed statistically significant sensitivity to binocular cues when tested late in the experiment. This result suggests that observers may discount binocular cues when they are first encountered in a VR environment. Laboratory assessments may thus underestimate the sensitivity of inexperienced observers to MID, especially for binocular cues."
https://openalex.org/W3010214164,"Seasonal phenomena in plants are primarily affected by day length and temperature. The shoot transcriptomes of trees grown in the field and a controlled-environment chamber were compared to characterize genes that control annual rhythms and the effects of day length- and temperature-regulated genes in the gymnosperm Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don), which exhibits seasonally indeterminate growth. Annual transcriptome dynamics were clearly demonstrated by principal component analysis using microarray data obtained under field-grown conditions. Analysis of microarray data from trees grown in a controlled chamber identified 2,314 targets exhibiting significantly different expression patterns under short-day (SD) and long-day conditions, and 2,045 targets exhibited significantly different expression patterns at 15°C (LT; low temperature) versus 25°C. Interestingly, although growth was suppressed under both SD and LT conditions, approximately 80% of the SD- and LT-regulated targets differed, suggesting that each factor plays a unique role in the annual cycle. The top 1,000 up-regulated targets in the growth/dormant period in the field coincided with more than 50% of the SD- and LT-regulated targets, and gene co-expression network analysis of the annual transcriptome indicated a close relationship between the SD- and LT-regulated targets. These results indicate that the respective effects of day length and temperature interact to control annual transcriptome dynamics. Well-known upstream genes of signaling pathways responsive to environmental conditions, such as the core clock (LHY/CjLHYb and CCA1/CjLHYa) and PEBP family (MFT) genes, exhibited unique expression patterns in Japanese cedar compared with previous reports in other species, suggesting that these genes control differences in seasonal regulation mechanisms between species. The results of this study provide new insights into seasonal regulation of transcription in Japanese cedar."
https://openalex.org/W3011334929,"Predictions of habitat suitability for invasive plant species can guide risk assessments at regional and national scales and inform early detection and rapid-response strategies at local scales. We present a general approach to invasive species modeling and mapping that meets objectives at multiple scales. Our methodology is designed to balance trade-offs between developing highly customized models for few species versus fitting non-specific and generic models for numerous species. We developed a national library of environmental variables known to physiologically limit plant distributions and relied on human input based on natural history knowledge to further narrow the variable set for each species before developing habitat suitability models. To ensure efficiency, we used largely automated modeling approaches and human input only at key junctures. We explore and present uncertainty by using two alternative sources of background samples, including five statistical algorithms, and constructing model ensembles. We demonstrate the use and efficiency of the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling [SAHM 2.1.2], a package in VisTrails, which performs the majority of the modeling analyses. Our workflow includes solicitation of expert feedback on model outputs such as spatial prediction results and variable response curves, and iterative improvement based on new data availability and directed field validation of initial model results. We highlight the utility of the models for decision-making at regional and local scales with case studies of two plant species that invade natural areas: fountain grass (Pennisetum setaceum) and goutweed (Aegopodium podagraria). By balancing model automation with human intervention, we can efficiently provide land managers with mapped predicted distributions for multiple invasive species to inform decisions across spatial scales."
https://openalex.org/W3011979430,"Brucellosis is an important zoonotic disease that affects both humans and animals. To date, laboratory surveillance is still essentially based on the traditional MLVA-16 methodology and the associated epidemiological information is frequently scarce. Our goal was to contribute to the improvement of Brucella spp. surveillance through the implementation of a whole genome sequencing (WGS) approach. We created a curated ready-to-use species-specific wgMLST scheme enrolling a panel of 2656 targets (http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3575026) and used this schema to perform a retrospective analysis of the genetic relatedness among B. melitensis strains causing human infection in Portugal (a country where brucellosis is an endemic disease) from 2010 to 2018. The strains showed a phylogenetic clustering within genotype II (25 out of 36) and IV (4 out of 36), and shared clades with strains isolated from countries with which Portugal has intense food trading, tourism and similar eating habits, such as Spain, Italy and Greece. In addition, our results point to the identification of strong associations between B. melitensis strains, likely underlying missed “outbreaks” as 22 out of the 36 strains showed genetic linkage with others. In fact, the applied gene-by-gene approach grouped these strains into six genetic clusters each one containing putative epidemiological links. Nevertheless, more studies will be needed in order to define the appropriate range of cut-offs (probable non-static cut-offs) that best illustrate the association between genetic linkage and epidemiological information and may serve as alerts for the health authorities. The release of this freely available and scalable schema contributes to the required technological transition for laboratorial surveillance of brucellosis and will facilitate the assessment of ongoing and future outbreaks in order to prevent the transmission spread."
https://openalex.org/W3009390623,"We examined the role of brown adipose tissue (BAT) for fever and emotional stress-induced hyperthermia. Wild-type and uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) knockout mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide intraperitoneally or intravenously, or subjected to cage exchange, and body temperature monitored by telemetry. Both genotypes showed similar febrile responses to immune challenge and both displayed hyperthermia to emotional stress. Neither procedure resulted in the activation of BAT, such as the induction of UCP-1 or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) mRNA, or reduced BAT weight and triglyceride content. In contrast, in mice injected with a β3 agonist, UCP-1 and PGC-1α were strongly induced, and BAT weight and triglyceride content reduced. Both lipopolysaccharide and the β3 agonist, and emotional stress, induced UCP-3 mRNA in skeletal muscle. A β3 antagonist did not attenuate lipopolysaccharide-induced fever, but augmented body temperature decrease and inhibited BAT activation when mice were exposed to cold. An α1 /α2b antagonist or a 5HT1A agonist, which inhibit vasoconstriction, abolished lipopolysaccharide-induced fever, but had no effect on emotional stress-induced hyperthermia. These findings demonstrate that in mice, UCP-1-mediated BAT thermogenesis does not take part in inflammation-induced fever, which is dependent on peripheral vasoconstriction, nor in stress-induced hyperthermia. However, both phenomena may involve UCP-3-mediated muscle thermogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3009812191,"Bringing up a child with disabilities in a low-income setting is challenged by inadequate resources, limited psycho-social support and poverty. Not surprisingly, many caregivers experience fatigue, distress and isolation. To address and investigate these issues, action was taken to set up twenty self-help groups focusing on caregiver empowerment. A realist evaluation design was adopted to evaluate impacts associated with the self-help process and to identify mechanisms determining the outcomes. Monthly monitoring visits were conducted to the groups during a ten-month set-up period, at the end of which eleven active groups remained, nine having dissolved due to disputes, corruption and extreme environmental conditions. A facilitated intervention was delivered to the active groups (N = 154) over a six-month period. The members were guided to review and discuss topics such as economic empowerment, personal situation, peer support, community inclusion, access to health and education. Evaluation employed mixed methods using questionnaires (n = 75) and semi-structured interviews (n = 36) pre- and post-intervention. At baseline, the burden of caregiving was characterised by aloneness, challenges, stigma and discrimination. Post-intervention, caregiver agency was defined by togetherness, capacity-building, acceptance and well-being. Significant impacts associated with caregiver perceptions included increased social support, reduced severity of child's disability and decreased effects of extrinsic factors affecting the caregiver's role. Mechanisms of 'handling goods and money' and 'social ties and support' appeared to underpin the outcomes. Caregiver empowerment was associated with newly developed skills, social connectedness and resource mobilisation.

Nef interacts with interleukin-2–inducible T-cell kinase (Itk) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), two Tec-family kinases expressed in HIV-1 target cells (CD4 T cells and macrophages, respectively). Using a cell-based bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, here we demonstrate that Nef recruits both Itk and Btk to the cell membrane and induces constitutive kinase activation in transfected 293T cells. Nef homodimerization-defective mutants retained their interaction with both kinases but failed to induce activation, supporting a role for Nef homodimer formation in the activation mechanism. HIV-1 infection up-regulates endogenous Itk activity in SupT1 T cells and donor-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, HIV-1 strains expressing Nef variants with mutations in the dimerization interface replicated poorly and were significantly attenuated in Itk activation. We conclude that direct activation of Itk and Btk by Nef at the membrane in HIV-infected cells may override normal immune receptor control of Tec-family kinase activity to enhance the viral life cycle.

Nef, one of four accessory proteins encoded by HIV-1, promotes viral infectivity (1Basmaciogullari S. Pizzato M. The activity of Nef on HIV-1 infectivity.Front.

Nef is a relatively small, membrane-associated protein (27–34 kDa, depending on the subtype) and is conserved among the primate lentiviruses (6Foster J.L. Garcia J.V.

Nef has no known intrinsic biochemical or enzymatic activities, functioning instead through interactions with numerous host proteins involved in signal transduction, endocytic trafficking, and host cell survival. For example, Nef down-regulates cell-surface receptors essential for viral entry (CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5) (7Aiken C. Konner J. Landau N.R. Lenburg M.E. Trono D.

Nef hijacks multiple host-cell kinase signaling pathways to mimic T-cell and macrophage activation, resulting in enhanced HIV-1 replication and viral spread. In particular, Nef interacts with and activates nonreceptor tyrosine kinases of the Src and Tec families that are normally involved in immune receptor signaling. Among the Src-family members, Nef selectively interacts with Hck and Lyn through their SH3 domains, resulting in constitutive kinase activation (15Trible R.P. Emert-Sedlak L. Smithgall T.E.

Each complex crystallizes as a 2:2 dimer, with Nef forming the dimer interface through conserved residues in its αB helix. Subsequent solution studies using hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS have confirmed that the Nef αB helix is responsible for dimer formation in both complexes, despite important differences in their overall quaternary structures (23Moroco J.A.

These structural studies suggest that Nef homodimerization may activate Hck and other host-cell kinases through a mechanism that involves clustering of kinase domains for activation via trans-autophosphorylation. Previous studies have linked the Tec family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases to the HIV-1 life cycle through Nef. Tec-family kinases have essential roles in immune receptor signaling (24Andreotti A.H. Schwartzberg P.L. Joseph R.E. Berg L.J. T-cell signaling regulated by the Tec family kinase, Itk.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2 (20519342): a002287Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and the interleukin-2–inducible T-cell kinase (Itk) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) are both expressed in HIV-1 target cells (CD4+ T cells and macrophages, respectively). Readinger et al. (25Readinger J.A. Schiralli G.M. Jiang J.K. Thomas C.J. August A. Henderson A.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Selective targeting of ITK blocks multiple steps of HIV replication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Subsequent work demonstrated that Nef links HIV-1 infection to Itk activation. In this previous study, it was demonstrated that Nef interacts with both Itk and Btk at the cell membrane and that a selective inhibitor of Itk kinase activity blocked Nef-dependent enhancement of viral infectivity and replication (26Tarafdar S. Poe J.A. Smithgall T.E. The accessory factor Nef links HIV-1 to Tec/Btk kinases in an Src homology 3 domain-dependent manner.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 (24722985): 15718-1572810.1074/jbc.M114.572099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Like the Src-family kinases, interaction with Itk was shared by Nef proteins representative of all major subtypes of HIV-1, supporting the activation of this T-cell kinase as a conserved and essential function. However, the mechanisms regulating Nef-dependent activation of Tec-family kinases are unknown. In the present study, we unraveled the molecular mechanism by which HIV-1 Nef activates Itk and Btk and demonstrate that this pathway is essential for both kinase activation and HIV-1 replication in T cells. Using a cell-based fluorescence complementation assay, we show that HIV-1 Nef interacts with Itk and Btk at the cell membrane, resulting in constitutive kinase activity. Kinase activation, but not interaction with Nef, depends upon Nef homodimerization, suggesting that Nef directly activates Itk through a mechanism that bypasses the T-cell receptor and Lck, a Src-family member essential for Itk activation in response to antigen stimulation (27Courtney A.H. Lo W.L. Weiss A. TCR signaling: mechanisms of initiation and propagation.Trends Biochem.

HIV-1 infection also enhanced endogenous Itk activity in T cells in a manner dependent on Nef homodimer formation. HIV-1 expressing Nef mutants defective for homodimerization replicated poorly in a T-cell line and in donor PBMCs, demonstrating that Nef-dependent activation of Itk is essential for efficient viral replication. Our data support the idea that selective inhibitors of the Nef–Itk signaling pathway may provide a new approach to antiretroviral therapy. Previous work has shown that Nef interacts with both Itk and Btk at the plasma membrane of transfected cells and that an Itk kinase inhibitor blocks Nef-dependent viral replication (26Tarafdar S. Poe J.A. Smithgall T.E. The accessory factor Nef links HIV-1 to Tec/Btk kinases in an Src homology 3 domain-dependent manner.J. Biol.

However, whether Nef induces activation of Itk or other Tec-family kinases in the membrane compartment was not reported. To address this question directly, we combined bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) with antiphosphotyrosine immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy to visualize Nef·kinase complex formation and activation simultaneously. Itk or Btk and Nef were fused to complementary, nonfluorescent fragments of the Venus variant of YFP. The kinases were then expressed either alone or together with Nef in 293T cells, followed by immunostaining for Nef and kinase protein expression as well as protein-tyrosine phosphorylation with anti-pTyr antibodies. When expressed alone, both Itk (Fig. 1) and Btk (Fig. 2) showed a diffuse subcellular staining pattern with both the kinase and anti-pTyr antibodies. Co-expression with Nef resulted in a strong, membrane-localized BiFC signal with both kinases, indicative of interaction, as well as a strong anti-pTyr immunoreactivity that also localized to the membrane. Treatment of the cells with the Itk inhibitor BMS-509744 (28Lin T.A. McIntyre K.W. Das J. Liu C. O'Day K.D. Penhallow B. Hung C.Y. Whitney G.S. Shuster D.J. Yang X. Townsend R. Postelnek J.

A, Btk was expressed either alone or together with WT or myristoylation-defective Nef (G2A) as BiFC pairs in the absence or presence of the Btk inhibitor, ibrutinib (1 μm) in 293T cells. The cells were fixed and stained for confocal microscopy with anti-pTyr antibodies as a measure of kinase activity (red) and anti-V5 antibodies to verify Btk protein expression (blue). Nef interaction with Btk is observed as fluorescence complementation of the YFP variant, Venus (BiFC; green). B, single-cell image analysis was performed as per the legend to Fig. 1. The fluorescence intensity ratio (pTyr:Btk expression) for each cell is presented as a horizontal bar, with each median value indicated by the red bar. Student's t tests were performed on the groups indicated by horizontal lines above the plot; p < 0.0001 in each case (***).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To quantify the results, the anti-pTyr and kinase expression IF signal intensities were measured for a minimum of 100 cells from each condition, and the results are shown as pTyr/kinase–IF signal ratios (Figs. 1B and 2B). This analysis clearly shows that cell populations co-expressing Itk or Btk with Nef had significantly higher ratios compared with those expressing the kinase alone or the inhibitor-treated cells expressing the Nef·kinase complex. We next investigated whether Nef stimulated Itk and Btk autophosphorylation on their respective activation loop tyrosines (pTyr511 and pTyr551, respectively), an essential step in Tec-family kinase activation. For this experiment, 293T cells were transfected as before and stained with phosphospecific antibodies for the activation loop tyrosines of Itk and Btk in place of the anti-pTyr antibody (Figs. S1 and S2). For both Itk and Btk, co-expression with Nef led to significant increases in activation loop phosphorylation at the cell membrane that was suppressed by the addition of ibrutinib. In addition to HIV-1 Nef, we also included SIV Nef (mac239 isolate) in this experiment. As with HIV-1 Nef, SIV Nef also induced strong membrane-associated autophosphorylation of both Itk and Btk (Figs. S1 and S2). These observations suggest that Tec-family kinase activation is a broadly conserved property of primate lentiviruses. Active complexes of Itk and Btk with Nef were observed predominantly at the cell membrane, suggesting that membrane association of Nef may be required for kinase activation. Unlike Tec-family kinases, Nef is constitutively associated with the membrane because of myristoylation of a conserved glycine residue at position 2 near the N terminus. To test the role of Nef membrane association in Tec-family kinase activation, we co-expressed a myristoylation-defective Nef mutant (Gly2 to Ala; G2A) with Itk or Btk and monitored interaction as well as kinase expression and activation as before. The Nef-G2A mutant induced significantly lower Itk and Btk activation compared with WT Nef (Figs. 1A and 2A), suggesting that membrane localization is required for kinase activation. The BiFC signal also revealed that Nef-G2A·kinase complexes were present in the cytoplasm in addition to partial localization at the membrane. Although myristoylation is essential for Nef membrane localization and function, a basic patch in the N-terminal region of Nef also contributes to membrane targeting and may be partially responsible for retention at the membrane. The results presented above show that active complexes of Itk and Btk localize almost exclusively to the cell membrane and that membrane localization may contribute to kinase activation. These findings imply that Nef actively recruits Tec-family kinases to the membrane, potentially short-circuiting the mechanisms normally responsible for regulated kinase activation. Both Itk and Btk have N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domains that bind phosphorylated inositol lipids (30Mohamed A.J. Yu L. Bäckesjö C.M. Vargas L. Faryal R. Aints A. Christensson B. Berglöf A. Vihinen M. Nore B.F. Smith C.I. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk): function, regulation, and transformation with special emphasis on the PH domain.Immunol.

Under physiological conditions, antigen receptor stimulation leads to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation, triggering phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate formation in the membrane and subsequent recruitment of Itk and Btk via their PH domains. To assess the impact of Nef on Itk and Btk localization more directly, we used the plot profile tool of the ImageJ image-analysis software package. This tool allowed us to generate a two-dimensional graph of the fluorescence intensities of pixels along a line drawn across the cytoplasm of cells expressing each kinase alone or in the presence of WT Nef or the myristoylation-defective mutant (Nef-G2A). As shown in Fig. 3, cells expressing Itk alone showed localization to both the cytoplasm and the membrane. In the presence of Nef, however, the localization shifted almost exclusively to the membrane; this effect was not observed with the Nef-G2A mutant. Unlike Itk, Btk showed very little membrane localization on its own, whereas co-expression with Nef led to a dramatic shift to the membrane compartment that was also dependent on Nef myristoylation. The ability of Nef to induce translocation of Itk and Btk to the membrane, along with kinase activation, strongly suggests that Nef can short-circuit antigen receptor signaling in HIV-infected cells for the benefit of the virus (see “Discussion”). Previous structural studies have demonstrated that Nef forms homodimers when crystallized in the presence of the regulatory SH3 and SH2 domains of Src-family kinases (20Alvarado J.J. Tarafdar S. Yeh J.I. Smithgall T.E. Interaction with the Src homology (SH3-SH2) region of the Src-family kinase Hck structures the HIV-1 Nef dimer for kinase activation and effector recruitment.J. Biol.

In these structures, the Nef homodimer interface is formed by the αB helices present in each Nef monomer and involves the side chains of residues Leu112, Tyr115, and Phe121, which come together to form a hydrophobic core (modeled in Fig. 4A). These hydrophobic residues are highly conserved among HIV-1 Nef subtypes, indicating that homodimerization may be an essential feature of HIV-1 Nef that is critical to its functions including activation of Itk and Btk. To test this hypothesis, we generated a panel of mutants in which these conserved hydrophobic residues were replaced with either aspartate (L112D, Y115D, and the corresponding double mutant, LY/DD) or alanine (F121A). WT and mutant Nef proteins were then expressed in recombinant form in Escherichia coli followed by analytical size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4B). WT Nef eluted from the size-exclusion column primarily as a dimer, whereas the mutants exist primarily (Y115D) or exclusively (L112D, F121A, and LY/DD) in the monomeric form. We then assessed the impact of the mutations on Nef homodimer formation in cells using the BiFC assay. All four Nef mutants showed a significant reduction in the BiFC signal arising from homodimer formation without affecting Nef protein expression (Fig. 4, C and D). Together with the analytical gel filtration data, these results confirm the importance of these three amino acids in Nef homodimer formation, consistent with the crystal structures. Using these dimerization-defective mutants, we investigated whether Nef dimer formation is required for constitutive activation of Tec-family kinases at the cell membrane. Each of the mutants was co-expressed with Itk or Btk as BiFC pairs in 293T cells as before, and kinase activity was assessed by immunofluorescence imaging with anti-pTyr and anti-kinase antibodies followed by single-cell image analysis. All four dimerization-defective Nef mutants failed to activate Itk (Fig. 5) and Btk (Fig. 6), with pTyr:kinase expression ratios equivalent to those observed with the kinases alone. Based on the BiFC signal, all four Nef mutants remained associated with each kinase protein at the cell membrane. These observations suggest that the Nef mutants most likely form nonproductive 1:1 heterodimers with the kinases, whereas the WT Nef protein induces a 2:2 dimer complex with the kinase and promotes autophosphorylation in trans.Figure 6Dimerization-defective Nef mutants interact with Btk but fail to induce kinase activation. A, Btk was expressed either alone or together with WT Nef or Nef dimerization-defective mutants as BiFC pairs in 293T cells. The cells were fixed and stained for confocal microscopy with anti-pTyr antibodies as a measure of kinase activity (red) and anti-V5 antibodies to verify Btk protein expression (blue). Nef interaction with Btk is observed as Venus fluorescence (BiFC; green). B, single-cell image analysis was performed as per the legend to Fig. 2. The fluorescence intensity ratio (pTyr:Btk expression) for each cell is shown as a horizontal bar, with the median value indicated by the red bar. Student's t tests were performed on the groups indicated by horizontal lines above the plot; p < 0.0001 in each case.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Very similar results were obtained when cells were stained with phosphospecific antibodies against the Itk and Btk activation loop phosphotyrosines in place of the general anti-pTyr antibody (Figs. S3 and S4). Not only did the Nef mutants fail to activate the kinases, the Nef-LY/DD and F121A mutants suppressed the autophosphorylation of both Itk and Btk well below the levels observed when the kinases were expressed in the absence of Nef. This observation, coupled with the sustained interaction of the Nef mutants with each kinase at the membrane by BiFC, suggests that dimerization-defective Nef proteins may suppress spontaneous autophosphorylation of Itk and Btk via a dominant-negative mechanism.

Cells from MTH1 knockout (MTH1KO) mice display a 2-fold increased mutation rate. However, these mice grow old and a higher tumor burden compared with MTH1 wildtype (MTH1WT) mice is only observed in old MTH1KO mice, suggesting that MTH1 is dispensible in the short term under normal conditions (4Tsuzuki T.

This is thought to be due to the elevated reactive oxygen species load present in cancer cells compared with normal cells, which damages free nucleotides.

Interestingly, not all developed inhibitors of MTH1 have the same cellular effect and a growing body of evidence suggests that MTH1 has other cellular roles in addition to sanitizing the oxidized nucleotide pool (7Warpman Berglund U.

We recently reported that human MTH1, in addition to hydrolyzing oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates, also is a highly efficient catalyst of O6-methyl-dGTP hydrolysis (10Jemth A.S. Gustafsson R.

This prompted us to test other methylated nucleotides as MTH1 substrates and we here present N6-methyl-dATP and N6-methyl-ATP as novel substrates for MTH1. We show that human MTH1 effectively catalyzes the hydrolysis of N6-methyl-dATP to N6-methyl-dAMP and also catalyzes N6-methyl-ATP hydrolysis, albeit at a lower rate. This N6-methyl-dATP hydrolysis activity was present in all the animal MTH1 homologues we tested, ranging from zebrafish to humans. Furthermore, we demonstrate that N6-methyl-dATP present in the nucleotide pool is incorporated into DNA in vivo in an MTH1-dependent manner. Because N6-methylation of adenine has been described to affect gene expression in eukaryotic cells (11Wu T.P. Wang T. Seetin M.G. Lai Y. Zhu S. Lin K. Liu Y. Byrum S.D. Mackintosh S.G. Zhong M.

Das B. N6-methyladenosine modification in mRNA: machinery, function and implications for health and diseases.FEBS J. 2016; 283 (26645578): 1607-163010.1111/febs.13614Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we speculate that this novel MTH1 activity may help to safeguard against dysregulation of the cellular epigenome and epitranscriptome. This study expands the substrate collection of human MTH1 and emphasizes the importance of MTH1 in sanitizing the nucleotide pool by catalyzing the hydrolysis of both methylated and oxidized nucleotides. MutT homologue 1 adenosine deaminase-like protein isoform 1 MTH1 knockout MTH1 wildtype pyrophosphatase ultra performance HPLC Protein Data Bank. The results of HPLC and MS analysis of reaction products after MTH1 incubation with N6-methyl-dATP over differing lengths of time, show that MTH1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of N6-methyl-dATP to N6-methyl-dAMP and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) (Fig. 1A). The amount of formed N6-methyl-dAMP increases in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B and C), with the loss of PPi clearly observed by detection of the mass of N6-methyl-dAMP. N6-methyl-dATP was found to be stable over time under the reaction conditions used, with no detected hydrolysis observed in the absence of enzyme for up to at least 6 h. To further evaluate the activity of MTH1 with N6-methyl-dATP we determined the specific activities of MTH1 with 50 μm dATP, N6-methyl-dATP, ATP, and N6-methyl-ATP. We found the specific activity with N6-methyl-dATP to be ∼20-fold higher than the activity with nonmethylated dATP (Fig. 2). MTH1 also displays a low but measurable activity with N6-methyl-ATP, whereas no detectable activity with ATP was observed. The specific activity with N6-methyl-ATP is ∼11 times lower than the activity with N6-methyl-dATP showing that MTH1 clearly prefers deoxyribonucleotides over ribonucleotides as substrates. Hydrolysis of the selected nucleotides was tested at two different MTH1 concentrations, showing a clear dependence of substrate hydrolysis on MTH1 concentrationFigure 2MTH1 activity with N6-methyl-dATP and N6-methyl-ATP compared with dATP. Activity of 1 and 5 nm MTH1 was tested with 50 μm N6-methyl-dATP, dATP, ATP, and N6-methyl-ATP in MTH1 reaction buffer (pH 8.0) at 22 °C. Reaction time was 30 min and 0.2 units/ml of PPase was used to generate Pi from produced PPi. Pi was detected by addition of malachite green reagent followed by measurement of the absorbance at 630 nm. Controls with PPase only was included and background signal was subtracted from the assay data. A Pi standard curve was included on the plate enabling determination of the concentration of formed PPi. Graph shows mean ± S.D. from one experiment performed in quadruplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Substrate saturation curves of MTH1 were generated for dATP, N6-methyl-dATP, N6-methyl-ATP, dGTP, and O6-methyl-dGTP (Fig. 3, A and B) at close to physiological pH (pH 7.5), and kinetic parameters were determined (Table 1). Addition of the N6-methyl group to dATP increases the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) ∼17-fold. Similarly, methylation of dGTP at the O6 position increases the kcat/Km value considerably. It is difficult to estimate the effect of N6-methylation on kcat and Km values because these values cannot be determined for dATP due to no substrate saturation in the concentration range used. However, it is likely that the Km value of MTH1 for dATP is higher than 200 μm, which was the highest dATP concentration used and which was still located in the linear part of the saturation curve. Consequently, the Km value for dATP is likely to be at least 1 order of magnitude higher than the Km value for N6-methyl-dATP. The kcat value of MTH1 with N6-methyl-dATP (2.0 s−1) is 2.7-fold lower compared with the kcat value of MTH1 with O6-methyl-dGTP (5.4 s−1) but 2-fold higher than the kcat value for dGTP (1.0 s−1). The Km value of MTH1 is ∼2.5 times lower for O6-methyl-dGTP compared with that for N6-methyl-dATP. This results in a kcat/Km value for O6-methyl-dGTP that is ∼6-fold higher compared with N6-methyl-dATP. This may partly be attributable to the lower Km value of MTH1 for dGTP compared with dATP, which may reflect a higher affinity for guanine compared with adenine. No substrate saturation was obtained with N6-methyl-ATP in the concentration range used, meaning the determination of kcat and Km was not possible. However, the kcat/Km value was determined from the slope of the linear part of the saturation curve to be 4100 m−1 s−1. This value is more than 1 order of magnitude lower than the corresponding value for N6-methyl-dATP, strongly supporting a preference of MTH1 for deoxyribonucleotides over ribonucleotides. Altogether, the kinetic analysis demonstrates that methylation of both N6 of dATP and O6 of dGTP greatly improves them as MTH1 substrates and that this enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of these methylated substrates with high catalytic efficiency. This result shows that the active site of MTH1 has the capability to accommodate N6-methylated dATP and O6-methylated dGTP in addition to the previously described oxidatively modified adenosine and guanine nucleoside triphosphates (13Fujikawa K.

To understand if the high activity of human MTH1 with N6-methyl-dATP is unique to humans or is also present in NUDT1 homologues from other species, we tested the activity of NUDT1 enzymes from humans (hMTH1), dogs (clNUDT1), pigs (ssNUDT1), rats (rnNUDT1), mice (mmNUDT1), zebrafish (zfNUDT1), the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (atNUDT1), and Escherichia coli MutT. At 50 μm N6-methyl-dATP and at a pH close to physiological (pH 7.5) all tested NUDT1 enzymes apart from E. coli MutT and atNUDT1 displayed notable activity toward N6-methyl-dATP (Fig. 5). This suggests that N6-methyl-dATP activity has been conserved through the evolution of vertebrates and is likely to have been present in the last common ancestor of bony fish and more developed vertebrates present more than 350 million years ago (22Postlethwait J.H. The zebrafish genome in context: ohnologs gone missing.J. Exp. Zool. B Mol. Dev. Evol. 2007; 308 (17068775): 563-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To analyze the sequence similarity between the distantly related MutT homologues we performed an amino acid sequence alignment of hMTH1, E. coli MutT, zfMTH1, and atNUDT1 based on their crystal structures. The sequence alignment reveals a high sequence identity between hMTH1 and zfMTH1 (70.8%) despite these enzymes being from distantly related organisms (Fig. S2A). To determine the binding mode of N6-methyl-dATP in the active site of MTH1, co-crystals of the nucleotide with hMTH1 were grown. The structure was solved to 2.45 Å resolution (Table S1) and the overall structure is shown in Fig. 6A. The structure shows clear electron density for N6-methyl-dAMP (Fig. 6B), indicating that hydrolysis of N6-methyl-dATP to the monophosphate form occurred during co-crystallization. The protein crystallized with four monomers in the asymmetric unit (chains A, B, C, and D). In the existing crystal form, the D-chain appears less ordered with slightly poorer electron density compared with the other monomers. The structure contains several sulfate molecules that are a result of the LiSO4 present in the crystallization buffer. Comparison of our structure with apo hMTH1 (PDB ID 3ZR1) resulted in low root mean square deviation values of 0.28–0.32 Å for the main chain Cα-atoms, indicating that the overall structures are virtually identical, with no structural changes induced upon ligand binding. The nucleotide-binding pocket of hMTH1 is comprised of a large number of hydrophobic amino acids including Phe-27, Phe-72, Phe-74, Met-81, Trp-117, and Phe-139 (Fig. 6B). The purine ring system of N6-methyl-dAMP is positioned by π-stacking interactions involving Trp-117 and Phe-72 and two hydrogen bonds with residue Asp-119, which also makes a weak interaction (3 Å) with nearby Asp-120. Asn-33 interacts weakly with the adenine base and the deoxyribose moiety of N6-methyl-dAMP as indicated by the longer bond distances of 3.4–3.5 Å. The deoxyribose group is further positioned by a hydrogen bond (2.5 Å) with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Thr-8. There are no hydrogen bond interactions between the protein-binding pocket residues and phosphate group of the nucleotide (Fig. 6B). The two aspartate residues Asp-119 and Asp-120 in the hMTH1 active site have been shown to be important for MTH1 being able to bind the substrates 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-oxo-dATP (23Waz S. Nakamura T.

In contrast to these previously solved structures, where both Asp-119 and Asp-120 interact with the modified nucleotides through hydrogen bonds, only Asp-119 makes direct hydrogen bond interactions to the nucleotide base in the MTH1 structure with N6-methyl-dAMP, with no atom of the nucleotide base of N6-methyl-dAMP within hydrogen bonding distance of Asp-120 (Fig. 7A). When comparing the MTH1 structure in complex with N6-methyl-dAMP to the structures with 2-oxo-dATP (PBD ID 5GHJ), 8-oxo-dGMP (PDB ID 3ZR0), and O6-methyl-dGMP (PDB ID 5OTM) these bases are shifted closer (0.53, 0.96, and 0.35 Å, respectively) to Asn-33 relative to the nucleotide base of N6-methyl-dAMP (Fig. 7, A–D, Fig. S3). The lack in capability to form additional hydrogen bonds with Asp-120 and Asn-33 like the other modified nucleotides (Fig. 7, A–D) may explain the 2.5-fold higher Km value observed for N6-methyl-dATP compared with O6-methyl-dGTP (Table 1). The hydrophobic interaction between MTH1 and the N6-methyl group of N6-methyl-dAMP pulls the base closer toward the hydrophobic subpocket, as is also observed for O6-methyl-dGMP (10Jemth A.S. Gustafsson R. Bräutigam L. Henriksson L. Vallin K.S.A. Sarno A. Almlöf I. Homan E. Rasti A. Warpman Berglund U. Stenmark P. Helleday T.

This hydrophobic interaction causes identical binding modes of O6-methyl-dGMP and N6-methyl-dAMP, despite their dramatically different hydrogen-bonding patterns (Fig. S3) indicating that this interaction makes a major contribution to the affinity for these substrates. In the structures with 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-oxo-dATP (23Waz S. Nakamura T. Hirata K. Koga-Ogawa Y. Chirifu M. Arimori T. Tamada T. Ikemizu S. Nakabeppu Y. Yamagata Y.

The protonation states of Asp-119 and Asp-120 in the N6-methyl-dAMP complex cannot be definitively stated. However, Asp-119 is likely to be protonated to interact with the N6-methyl group of the ligand as well as a nearby nitrogen from the purine ring, whereas the protonation state of Asp-120 is more ambiguous. In the interaction between Asp-119 and Asp-120 the proton could potentially be provided by either amino acid (Fig. 7).Figure 7Schematic representation of the recognition of nucleotides by hMTH1.

https://openalex.org/W3009371342,"Medial vascular calcification (MVC) is a highly prevalent disease associated with a high risk of severe, potentially lethal, complications. While animal studies may not systematically be circumvented, in vitro systems have been proven useful to study disease physiopathology. In the context of MVC, the absence of a clinically relevant standardized in vitro method prevents the appropriate comparison and overall interpretation of results originating from different experiments. The aim of our study is to establish in vitro models mimicking in vivo vascular calcification and to select the best methods to unravel the mechanisms involved in MVC. Human aortic smooth muscle cells and rat aortic rings were cultured in different conditions. The influence of fetal calf serum (FCS), alkaline phosphatase, phosphate and calcium concentrations in the medium were evaluated. We identified culture conditions, including the herein reported Aorta Calcifying Medium (ACM), which allowed a reproducible and specific medial calcification of aortic explants. Studying cells and aortic explants cultured, the involvement of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) pathway, fibrosis and apoptosis processes in in vitro MVC were demonstrated. Expression of osteoblastic markers was also observed suggesting the occurrence of transdifferentiation of smooth muscle cells to osteoblasts in our models. The use of these models will help researchers in the field of vascular calcification to achieve reproducible results and allow result comparison in a more consistent way."
https://openalex.org/W3009652139,"The identification of Aspergillus species and azole resistance is highly important for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis (IA), which requires improvements in current fungal diagnostic methods. We aimed to develop multiplex real-time PCR to identify major Aspergillus section and azole resistance. BenA and cyp51A genes were used to design primers, probes, and control DNA for multiplex PCR. Qualitative and quantitative analysis was conducted for 71 Aspergillus and 47 non-Aspergillus isolates. Further, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) from hyphae or conidia were determined according to the culture time. Newly developed real-time PCR showed 100% specificity to each Aspergillus section (Fumigati, Nigri, Flavi, and Terrei), without cross-reaction between different sections. In quantitative analysis of sensitivity measurements, LOD and LOQ were 40 fg and 400 fg, respectively. Melting temperature analysis of the cyp51A promoter to identify azole resistance showed temperatures of 83.0 ± 0.3°C and 85.6 ± 0.6°C for susceptible A. fumigatus and resistant isolates with TR34 mutation, respectively. The minimum culture time and fungal colony size required for successful detection were 24 h and 0.4 cm in diameter, respectively. The developed multiplex real-time PCR can identify common Aspergillus sections quantitatively and detect presence of the TR34 mutation. Further, this method shows high sensitivity and specificity, allowing successful detection of early-stage fungal colonies within a day of incubation. These results can provide a template for rapid and accurate diagnosis of IA."
https://openalex.org/W3011641779,"Hunting can be used as a tool for wildlife management, through limitation of population densities and dissuading game from using sensitive areas. The success of these approaches requires in depth knowledge of prey movement. Indeed, movement decisions of game during hunting may affect the killing success of hunters as well as the subsequent location of surviving animals. We thus investigated red deer movement responses to drive hunts and their causal factors. We studied 34 hunting events in the National Estate of Chambord (France) and thereby provided a fine-scale characterization of the immediate and delayed movement responses of red deer to drive hunts. Red deer responded to drive hunts either by immediately fleeing the hunted area, or by initially remaining before ultimately fleeing after the hunters had departed. A few hours after the hunt, all individuals were located in distant areas (> 2 kilometres) from the hunted area. Immediate flight responses were less common when drive hunts occurred in areas with dense understorey. However, neither beater/dog densities nor site familiarity influenced the immediate flight decision. Following a drive hunt, red deer remained outside the hunted areas for periods twice as long compared to periods when no hunting occurred (34 hours vs. 17 hours). Such knowledge of game movement rates in response to drive hunts may help the development of informed management policy for hunted red deer populations."
https://openalex.org/W3011937189,"Introduction Given the relative recency of Domestic and Family Violence (DFV) management as a field of endeavour, it is not surprising that interventions for addressing DFV is still in its infancy in developing countries. In order to maximise the success of an intervention, it is important to know which aspects of the intervention are considered important and helpful by service providers and service users. This study, therefore, examined the acceptability of an antenatal-based psychosocial intervention targeting DFV in Nepal and explored suggestions for improving the program in future. Materials and methods Intervention participants and health care providers (HCPs) were interviewed using semi-structured interviews. Data were audio-recorded and thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Final codes and themes were identified using an iterative review process among the research team. Results Themes emerging from the data were grouped into domains including perceptions towards DFV, impact of the intervention on women’s lives and recommendations for improving the program. DFV was recognised as a significant problem requiring urgent attention for its prevention and control. Intervention participants expressed that they felt safe to share their feelings during the counselling session and got opportunity to learn new skills to cope with DFV. The majority of the participants recommended multiple counselling sessions and a continued provision of the service ensuring the intervention’s accessibility by a large number of women. Discussion This is the first study to document the perspectives of women and HCPs regarding an antenatal-based intervention targeting psychosocial consequences of DFV in Nepal. There was a clear consensus around the need to engage, support and empower victims of DFV and the intervention was well received by the participants. Ensuring good mental health and wellbeing among victims of DFV requires work across individual, organisational and community levels."
https://openalex.org/W3012463874,"After the generally unexpected outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, many explanations were proposed to account for the results. Three narratives that received a considerable amount of media attention were that sexist, racist, and/or nationalist attitudes influenced voting decisions. Some empirical work has supported each of these accounts. However, sexism, racism, and nationalism are interrelated, and most studies about the 2016 election have not examined these three factors in conjunction to determine the unique contribution of each. Thus, we investigated the extent to which each factor (assessed as sexism toward women, Modern Racism, and U.S. nationalism) was uniquely related to evaluations of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, voting intentions, and actual voting behavior. Participants completed online questionnaires before (N = 489) and after (N = 192) the 2016 U.S. election. More positive evaluation of Clinton and intentions to vote for Clinton were associated with lower levels of Modern Racism. More positive evaluation of Trump was associated with greater sexism toward women, Modern Racism, and U.S. nationalism. Intent to vote for Trump was associated with greater sexism toward women and Modern Racism. However, only Modern Racism significantly predicted voting behavior. Greater Modern Racism was associated with greater likelihood of voting for Trump and lower likelihood of voting for Clinton. When considered in conjunction, Modern Racism was the most consistent predictor across the different election outcome variables. Sexism toward women and U.S. nationalism were generally not significantly related to evaluations, intentions to vote, or voting behavior when accounting for Modern Racism. Thus, our data indicate that Modern Racism was correlated with vote choice in the 2016 election."

Here, we investigated the transcriptome of honeybees after exposure to 9.4 mg/L amitraz for 10 d, a subchronic dose. Overall, 279 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (237 upregulated, 42 downregulated). Several, including Pla2, LOC725381, LOC413324, LOC724386, LOC100577456, LOC551785, and P4504c3, were validated by quantitative PCR.

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses revealed that amitraz treatment affected the relaxin signaling pathway, platelet activation, and protein digestion and absorption."
https://openalex.org/W3011606827,"When questioning the veracity of an utterance, we perceive certain non-linguistic behaviours to indicate that a speaker is being deceptive. Recent work has highlighted that listeners’ associations between speech disfluency and dishonesty are detectable at the earliest stages of reference comprehension, suggesting that the manner of spoken delivery influences pragmatic judgements concurrently with the processing of lexical information. Here, we investigate the integration of a speaker’s gestures into judgements of deception, and ask if and when associations between nonverbal cues and deception emerge. Participants saw and heard a video of a potentially dishonest speaker describe treasure hidden behind an object, while also viewing images of both the named object and a distractor object. Their task was to click on the object behind which they believed the treasure to actually be hidden. Eye and mouse movements were recorded. Experiment 1 investigated listeners’ associations between visual cues and deception, using a variety of static and dynamic cues. Experiment 2 focused on adaptor gestures. We show that a speaker’s nonverbal behaviour can have a rapid and direct influence on listeners’ pragmatic judgements, supporting the idea that communication is fundamentally multimodal."
https://openalex.org/W3009194294,"Near-infrared transillumination is used in the diagnosis and the management of different eye diseases. In particular, it enables the visualization of melanin in the pigment epithelium of the iris. This technique is valuable in such conditions as pigment dispersion syndrome and Adie's tonic pupil. Thus, objective quantification of the amount of melanin shedded from the iris pigment epithelium may help in the management of these conditions. By combining aperture photometry with near-infrared iris transillumination this can be achieved. A total of 4 patients (7 eyes) were examined. Three patients were diagnosed with pigment dispersion syndrome in both eyes. One patient had Adie's tonic pupil in one eye. Near-infrared iris transillumination was performed by using a prototype apparatus. Aperture photometry measurements were carried out through specially developed software. The signal-to-noise ratio of the prototype apparatus was 52 dB (399:1). Each pixel within the near-infrared transillumination image corresponded with an area size of the iris of 85 μm x 83 μm. Measurements were taken from several points of the iris in all patients. The average aperture photometry value of transillumination defects was 1321.53 (ADU) ± 501.08 SD, while the average aperture photometry value of the papillary ruff was 90.83 (ADU) ± 53.4. On average transillumination defects transmit 14.55 times more near-infrared light than the papillary ruff. A prototype apparatus for the capture of near-infrared iris transillumination images and custom software enabling aperture photometry measurements of the obtained images has been developed for the purpose of this study. This study demonstrates a potential application of this technique in the diagnosis and management of patients with such conditions as pigment dispersion syndrome and Adie's tonic pupil."
https://openalex.org/W3009873405,"The objective of this study was to regulate the cytotoxicity of cisplatin (cisPt) minimizing its adverse effects. For this purpose, the lowest cisPt concentration needed to obtain a significant positive response in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) was explored. Two adjuvant agents as gold nanoparticles (AuNP) and chelating tricine were tested as enhancers in cisPt treatment. Effectiveness of all treatments was assessed by means of biochemical techniques, which offer quantitative data, as well as two microscopy–based techniques that provided qualitative cell imaging. The present work confirms the effectiveness of free cisplatin at very low concentrations. In order to enhance its effectiveness while the side effects were probably diminished, cisPt 3.5 μM was administered with AuNP 2.5 mM, showing an effectiveness practically equal to that observed with free cisPt. However, the second treatment investigated, based on cisPt 3.5 μM combined with tricine 50 mM, enhanced drug effectiveness, increasing the percentage of cells dying by apoptosis. This treatment was even better in terms of cell damage than free cisPt at 15 μM. Images obtained by TEM and cryo-SXT confirmed these results, since a notable number of apoptotic bodies were detected when cisPt was combined with tricine. Thus, tricine was clearly a better adjuvant for cisPt treatments."

We investigated the association between mode of delivery on birth experience in second birth among women with a first cesarean. Methods A population-based cohort study based on the Swedish Pregnancy Register with 808 women with a first cesarean and eligible for TOLAC in 2014–2017. Outcomes were mean birth experience measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) score from 1–10 and having a negative birth experience defined as VAS score ≤5. Linear and logistic regression analyses were performed with β-estimates and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Mean VAS score among women with an elective repeat cesarean (n = 251 (31%)), vaginal birth (n = 388 (48%)) or unplanned repeat cesarean (n = 169 (21%)) in second birth were 8.8 (standard deviation SD 1.4), 8.0 (SD 2.0) and 7.6 (SD 2.1), respectively. Compared to women having an elective repeat cesarean, women having an unplanned repeat cesarean delivery had five-fold higher odds of negative birth experience (adjusted OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.5–16.5). Women having a first elective cesarean and a subsequent unplanned repeat cesarean delivery had the highest odds of negative birth experience (crude OR 7.3, 95% CI 1.5–35.5). Conclusions Most women with a first cesarean scored their second birth experience as positive irrespective of mode of delivery. However, the odds of a negative birth experience increased among women having an unplanned repeat cesarean delivery, especially when the first cesarean delivery was elective."

Here, we explored the consequences of genetically encoded induction of the cell volume-regulating Ca2+-activated KCa3.1 channel (Kcnn4) for murine epidermal homeostasis. Doxycycline-treated mice harboring the KCa3.1+-transgene under the control of the reverse tetracycline-sensitive transactivator (rtTA) showed 800-fold channel overexpression above basal levels in the skin and solid KCa3.1-currents in keratinocytes. This overexpression resulted in epidermal spongiosis, progressive epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis, itch and ulcers. The condition was accompanied by production of the pro-proliferative and pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-β1 (60-fold), IL-6 (33-fold), and TNFα (26-fold) in the skin. Treatment of mice with the KCa3.1-selective blocker, Senicapoc, significantly suppressed spongiosis and hyperplasia, as well as induction of IL-β1 (-88%) and IL-6 (-90%). In conclusion, KCa3.1-induction in the epidermis caused expression of pro-proliferative cytokines leading to spongiosis, hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis. This skin condition resembles pathological features of eczematous dermatitis and identifies KCa3.1 as a regulator of epidermal homeostasis and spongiosis, and as a potential therapeutic target."

The neonatal baboon model may provide a unique opportunity to identify serologic markers associated with this disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate if Hyaluronic Acid (HA), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1), Amino-terminal Propeptide of Type-III Collagen (PIIINP) and Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) score associate with histological liver disease in neonatal baboons exposed to PN. Preterm baboons delivered via c-section at 67% gestation received PN for 14 days with or without Intralipid (PRT+IL, PRT-IL, respectively) or were sacrificed after birth (PRTCTR). Term baboons were sacrificed after birth (TERMCTR) or survived 14 days (TERM+14d). Serum HA, TIMP1, and PIIINP concentrations were measured by ELISA. A blinded pathologist assigned liver histological scores following necropsy. HA increased 9.1-fold, TIMP1 increased 2.2-fold, and ELF score increased 1.4-fold in PRT-IL compared to PRTCTR. ALT, AST, and GGT were within normal limits and did not vary between groups. A trend towards increased fibrosis was found in PRT-IL baboons. Microvesicular hepatocyte steatosis and Kupffer cell hypertrophy were elevated in PRT-IL vs PRTCTR. HA and TIMP1 were significantly elevated in preterm baboons with early histological findings of liver disease evidenced by hepatic steatosis, Kupffer cell hypertrophy and a trend towards fibrosis whereas traditional markers of liver disease remained normal. These novel markers could potentially be utilized for monitoring early hepatic injury in neonates."
