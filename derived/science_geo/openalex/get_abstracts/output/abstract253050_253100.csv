https://openalex.org/W2042112749,"The subjective sense of future time plays an essential role in human motivation. Gradually, time left becomes a better predictor than chronological age for a range of cognitive, emotional, and motivational variables. Socioemotional selectivity theory maintains that constraints on time horizons shift motivational priorities in such a way that the regulation of emotional states becomes more important than other types of goals. This motivational shift occurs with age but also appears in other contexts (for example, geographical relocations, illnesses, and war) that limit subjective future time."
https://openalex.org/W2009644747,"In the Drosophila germline, repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs) ensure genomic stability by silencing endogenous selfish genetic elements such as retrotransposons and repetitive sequences. Whereas small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) derive from both the sense and antisense strands of their double-stranded RNA precursors, rasiRNAs arise mainly from the antisense strand. rasiRNA production appears not to require Dicer-1, which makes microRNAs (miRNAs), or Dicer-2, which makes siRNAs, and rasiRNAs lack the 2′,3′ hydroxy termini characteristic of animal siRNA and miRNA. Unlike siRNAs and miRNAs, rasiRNAs function through the Piwi, rather than the Ago, Argonaute protein subfamily. Our data suggest that rasiRNAs protect the fly germline through a silencing mechanism distinct from both the miRNA and RNA interference pathways."

People with above-average income are relatively satisfied with their lives but are barely happier than others in moment-to-moment experience, tend to be more tense, and do not spend more time in particularly enjoyable activities. Moreover, the effect of income on life satisfaction seems to be transient. We argue that people exaggerate the contribution of income to happiness because they focus, in part, on conventional achievements when evaluating their life or the lives of others."
https://openalex.org/W2144032315,"Adipose tissue expression and circulating concentrations of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) correlate positively with adiposity. To ascertain the roles of MCP-1 overexpression in adipose, we generated transgenic mice by utilizing the adipocyte P2 (aP2) promoter (aP2-MCP-1 mice). These mice had higher plasma MCP-1 concentrations and increased macrophage accumulation in adipose tissues, as confirmed by immunochemical, flow cytometric, and gene expression analyses. Tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 mRNA levels in white adipose tissue and plasma non-esterified fatty acid levels were increased in transgenic mice. aP2-MCP-1 mice showed insulin resistance, suggesting that inflammatory changes in adipose tissues may be involved in the development of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance in aP2-MCP-1 mice was confirmed by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies showing that transgenic mice had lower rates of glucose disappearance and higher endogenous glucose production than wild-type mice. Consistent with this, insulin-induced phosphorylations of Akt were significantly decreased in both skeletal muscles and livers of aP2-MCP-1 mice. MCP-1 pretreatment of isolated skeletal muscle blunted insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, which was partially restored by treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126, suggesting that circulating MCP-1 may contribute to insulin resistance in aP2-MCP-1 mice. We concluded that both paracrine and endocrine effects of MCP-1 may contribute to the development of insulin resistance in aP2-MCP-1 mice.

Obesity correlates closely with insulin resistance (1Flier J.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 337-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 2Wellen K.E. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Clin.

Energy excess results in adipocyte hypertrophy, which in turn exerts deleterious effects on insulin sensitivity. Larger adipocytes are less insulin-sensitive as shown by impaired insulin stimulated glucose uptake. Moreover, diet-induced hypertrophy of adipocytes leads to changes in the profile of adipokines toward a deterioration of insulin sensitivity, particularly with decreased adiponectin levels (6Yamauchi T.

Recent studies have shown that obesity is associated not only with larger adipocytes but also with increasing numbers of infiltrating macrophages in adipose tissues (8Soukas A. Cohen P. Socci N.D.

These adipose tissue macrophages are currently considered to be a major cause of obesity-associated chronic low grade inflammation (2Wellen K.E. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Clin.

These inflammatory molecules may have local effects on white adipose tissue (WAT) physiology as well as potential systemic effects on other organs, which culminate in insulin resistance (12Kershaw E.E. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (3754) Google Scholar). The molecular signals that trigger the macrophage accumulation in obese WAT are, however, not yet known. How macrophage accumulation in adipose tissues causes systemic insulin resistance is currently unknown. Among inflammatory molecules up-regulated in adipose tissues of obese animals and humans, MCP-1 has been viewed as one of the likely candidate adipokines initiating macrophage infiltration of the adipose tissue and inducing systemic insulin resistance. MCP-1 is a member of the CC chemokine family and promotes migration of inflammatory cells by chemotaxis and integrin activation (18Ashida N. Arai H. Yamasaki M. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16555-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and it has been reported to recruit monocytes from the blood into atherosclerotic lesions, thereby promoting foam cell formation (19Boring L.

MCP-1 expression in adipose tissue and plasma MCP-1 levels have been found to correlate positively with the degree of obesity (9Weisberg S.P. McCann D. Desai M. Rosenbaum M. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1796-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (7562) Google Scholar, 10Xu H. Barnes G.T. Yang Q. Tan G. Yang D. Chou C.J. Sole J. Nichols A. Ross J.S.

In addition, increased expression of this chemokine in adipose tissue precedes the expression of other macrophage markers during the development of obesity (10Xu H. Barnes G.T. Yang Q. Tan G. Yang D. Chou C.J. Sole J. Nichols A. Ross J.S. Tartaglia L.A. Chen H. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (5240) Google Scholar). A recent report on mice lacking C-C motif chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2), a receptor for MCP-1, and other several chemokines suggested the MCP-1/CCR2 pathway to influence the development of obesity and insulin resistance via adipose macrophage accumulation and inflammation (23Weisberg S.P. Hunter D. Huber R. Lemieux J. Slaymaker S. Vaddi K. Charo I. Leibel R.L. Ferrante A.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that MCP-1 may serve as a signal that triggers inflammation by attracting macrophages into adipose tissues as well as an adipokine that causes insulin resistance by directly affecting insulin signaling in other organs. In this study, we assessed the effect of adipose overexpression of MCP-1 on the development of insulin resistance by generating transgenic (TG) mice under the adipocyte P2 (aP2) promoter. The TG mice showed increased macrophage accumulation in adipose tissues with higher plasma MCP-1 concentrations than littermate wild-type (WT) mice. The TG mice were insulin-resistant as shown by insulin tolerance test (ITT), hyperinsulinemic euglycemic studies, and insulin signal studies. Because the TG mice displayed increased gene expression of TNF-α and IL-6 as well as higher plasma concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), adipocyte dysfunction caused by macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue may contribute to the development of systemic insulin resistance. In addition, we demonstrated that MCP-1 directly attenuated insulin signaling in myotube cells and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in isolated skeletal muscle, suggesting that higher circulating MCP-1 may have a direct negative impact on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in aP2-MCP-1 mice. Thus, we conclude that both macrophage accumulation leading to adipocyte dysfunction (local effects on adipose tissues) and direct effects of circulating MCP-1 on insulin target organs (endocrine effects) contribute to the development of insulin resistance in aP2-MCP-1 mice. Reagents—Recombinant mouse CCL2/JE/MCP-1 protein was purchased from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). U0126 was purchased from Calbiochem. 2-Deoxy-d-[1-14C]glucose and l-[1-3H]glucose were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (αPY), rabbit polyclonal antibodies to insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, IRS-2, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 regulatory subunit were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to insulin receptor β (IRβ) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p44/42 MAPK, phosphor-p44/42 MAPK, Akt, and phospho-Akt (Ser-473) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Cell Culture, Differentiation, and in Vitro Assay—C2C12 mouse skeletal myoblast cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C and cultured to confluence. To induce differentiation, cells were switched to media containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2.5% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for the indicated time periods. For the Western blotting analyses, cells were serum-deprived for 10 h in media and treated with 10 nm MCP-1 for 5 min to detect the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. C2C12 cells were treated with 1-10 nm MCP-1 for 30 min before 10 nm insulin stimulation to test activation of insulin signaling. In some experiments cells were pretreated with U0126, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal protein kinase (MEK), for 30 min before MCP-1 addition. Generation of TG Mice Expressing MCP-1 in Adipose Tissues—A murine MCP-1 coding sequence cDNA for insertion was prepared by cloning reverse transcriptase-PCR products from mouse macrophage mRNA into a 2.1-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen). For overexpression in adipose tissues, transgene expression was targeted to adipose tissue using the mouse aP2 promoter (24Graves R.A. Tontonoz P. Platt K.A. Ross S.R. Spiegelman B.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 49: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) kindly provided by Dr. Bruce Spiegelman (Dana Farber Institute, Boston, MA). The transgene consisted of 5.4 kilobases of the aP2 gene promoter linked to rabbit β-globin, the 447 bp MCP-1 cDNA, and a polyadenylation sequence (Fig. 2A). The construct was inserted into a pUC19 vector (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.) and cloned. The purified AscI-AscI fragment was microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized DBF2 eggs. The recipient eggs were [C57BL/6 × DBA2] F2 hybrids. TG founder or F2 mice were identified by Southern blot analysis of tail DNAs using the cDNA probe to the BamHI/BamHI site in MCP-1 and PCR. The primers used for genotyping PCR were as follows: 5′ primer, 5′-CATCCTGCCTTTCTCTTTATGGTTAC-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-CTAGTTCACTGTCACACTGGTC-3′. From the 13 lines of TG mice obtained, we selected three lines showing graded expression of MCP-1 and designated them low (L), middle (M), and high (H). The founder and TG descendants were bred onto a C57BL/6 background for two generations. The F2 TG mice and their littermates were used in experiments. TG mice served as heterozygotes. Animal Care—ob/ob mice with a C57BL/6 background were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). C57BL/6 mice were purchased from CLEA Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Mice were housed under a 12-h light-dark cycle and given ad libitum access to normal chow MF consisting of 25% (w/w) protein, 53% carbohydrates, 6% fat, and 8% water (Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) or a high fat diet 32 consisting of 25.5% (w/w) protein, 2.9% fiber, 4.0% ash, 29.4% carbohydrates, 32% fat, and 6.2% water (CLEA Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan). All experiments in this study were performed on male mice. The animal care and procedures for the experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Tokyo. RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis—Mice were sacrificed after a 6-h fast and the epididymal fat pad (for epididymal WAT), subcutaneous fat (for subcutaneous WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT), liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and muscle were excised. Total RNA was prepared from tissues using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blot analysis was performed with 15 μg of total RNA according to the standard protocol. Total RNA was loaded onto a 1.3% agarose gel then transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+; Amersham Biosciences). MCP-1 coding sequence cDNA was used as the probe template. The corresponding bands were quantified by exposure of BAS 2000 to the filters and measurement with BAStation software (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from various tissues or C2C12 cells with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. After treatment with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) to remove genomic DNA, cDNA was synthesized with MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and TaqMan quantitative PCR (50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min) was then performed with the ABI Prism 7900 PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems) to amplify samples for MCP-1, F4/80, CD68, matrix metallopeptidase 12 (MMP12), glucose-6-phosphatase, TNF-α, IL-6, resistin, adiponectin, leptin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), CCR2, and cyclophilin cDNA. The primers used for cyclophilin were as described previously (25Suzuki R. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Komeda K. Kubota N. Eto K. Yamauchi T. Azuma K. Kaneto H. Taguchi T. Koga T. German M.S. Watada H.

The relative abundance of transcripts was normalized to constitutive expression of cyclophilin mRNA. Isolation of Adipocytes and Stromal-vascular Cells (26Takahashi M. Kamei Y. Ezaki O. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 288: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar)—Mice were anesthetized, and epididymal white fat pads were removed. The fat pads were rinsed in saline and cut into small pieces, then digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) with Krebs-Henseleit-HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 20 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin and 2 mmol/liter glucose at 37 °C in a shaking water bath for 45 min. Then digested tissues were filtered through mesh and fractionated by brief centrifugation (1000 rpm). Floating cells were adipocytes, and the pellet was nonadipocytes (stromal-vascular cells (SVCs)). Both cell types were rinsed three times with Krebs-Henseleit-HEPES buffer and used in RNA extraction or flow cytometry analysis. Flow Cytometry Analysis (9Weisberg S.P. McCann D. Desai M.

The SVCs were rinsed twice and resuspended in Pharmingen stain buffer (BD Biosciences). The cell number was calculated by hemocytometing, and the cells were incubated with FcBlock (BD Biosciences) for 10 min at 4 °C before the incubation with either anti-mouse CD11b antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor488 (Caltag Laboratories) or anti-mouse F4/80 antibodies conjugated with phycoerythrin (Caltag Laboratories) or each of the matching isotopes as controls for 30 min at 4 °C. After incubation with the antibodies, the cells were rinsed twice and resuspended in Pharmingen stain buffer. After labeling with TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen), the cells were analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Data acquisition and analysis were performed using CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences). Dead cells were gated out by a combination of forward scatter side scatter (FSC/SSC) and TO-PRO-3 dot plots. The numbers of macrophages in epididymal white adipose tissues were calculated by multiplying the number of SVCs by the percentage of CD11d and F4/80 double positive cells. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Tissues and cells were homogenized and lysed with ice-cold buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation, immunoprecipitation of liver and muscle proteins was performed as described previously (27Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Takahashi Y.

Samples were separated on polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond-P PVDF transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After incubating the membrane with antibodies, bands were detected by ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Histological and Immunohistochemical Analysis of WAT—An epididymal fat pad was removed from each animal, fixed in 10% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, and maintained at 4 °C for 2 days. Fixed specimens were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. The fat pad was then cut into 5-μm sections at 50-μm intervals and then mounted on silanized slides. After deparaffinization, the sections were stained with rat monoclonal F4/80 antibody (Serotec Ltd.) at a 1:1000 concentration followed by counter-staining with hematoxylin. The adipocyte area was manually traced and analyzed with Win ROOF software (Mitani Co. Ltd., Chiba, Japan). The area was measured in four high-power fields (275,000 μm2/field) from different sections, and the histogram was drawn by analyzing 6 mice per group according to methods described previously (4Kubota N.

The adipocyte area was measured in 400 or more cells per mouse on normal chow or in 180 or more cells per mouse on the high fat diet. The total number of nuclei and the number of F4/80 positive nuclei were counted in four different high-power fields from each of four different sections. The nuclei of more than 2000 cells per mouse on normal chow or more than 1000 cells per mouse on the high fat diet were counted. The ratio of F4/80 positive nuclei was calculated as the number of nuclei of F4/80-expressing cells divided by the total number of nuclei in sections of a sample. Measurement of 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG) Uptake—This assay was performed as described previously (28Murakami K. Tsunoda M. Ide T. Ohashi M. Mochizuki T. Metabolism. 1999; 48: 1450-1454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The soleus muscles of 9-week-old C57BL/6 mice were removed from the hindlimbs, ligated around each tendon using silk surgical thread, and attached across a plastic holder. The muscles were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm HEPES, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm sodium pyruvate (buffer A). For MCP-1 pretreatment, the muscles were incubated in buffer A containing 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 nm MCP-1 for 30 min at 37 °C before insulin treatment. The muscles were incubated with or without 10 nm insulin in buffer A containing 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 nm MCP-1 at 30 °C for 10 min. To determine 2-DG uptake, the muscles were transferred to buffer A containing 1 mm 2-DG (0.5 μCi/ml 2-deoxy-d-[1-14C]glucose) and 1 mm l-glucose (0.5 μCi/ml l-[1-3H]glucose) and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. For U0126 rescue experiments, 20 μm U0126 were added to all of the buffers. The buffers were continuously gassed with 95% O2, 5%CO2 in a shaking incubator. To terminate the reaction, the muscles were washed 3 times with chilled buffer A and then dissolved in 5 n NaOH. The samples were neutralized with 5 n HCl and dissolved in ACSII (Amersham Biosciences). 14C and 3H specific activities were counted by a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). The specific uptake of 2-DG was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific uptake of l-glucose from total uptake 2-DG uptake. Plasma MCP-1, Adiponectin, Leptin, and NEFA Measures—Mice were fasted for 6 h before plasma was obtained. Plasma MCP-1, adiponectin, and leptin levels were determined with a mouse JE/MCP-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (R&D Systems), mouse adiponectin ELISA kit (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), and mouse leptin ELISA kit (R&D Systems), respectively. Plasma NEFAs (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan) were assayed by enzymatic methods. Measurement of Tissue Triglyceride Contents—Liver and muscle tissues were homogenized, and their triglyceride contents were determined as described previously (6Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H.

The animals were intraperitoneally injected with 0.75 milliunits/g (body weight) human insulin (Humulin R; Lilly). Blood samples were drawn from the tail vein at the times indicated, and glucose was measured with an automatic blood glucose meter (Glutest Pro, Sanwa Chemical, Nagoya, Japan). Glucose Tolerance Test—Before the study the mice were fasted for 16 h starting at 19:00, and at the end of the fast they were orally loaded with glucose at 1.0 mg/g (body weight). Blood samples were collected at different times, and glucose was immediately measured with an automatic blood glucose meter. Whole blood was collected and centrifuged in heparinized tubes, and the plasma was stored at -20 °C. Insulin levels were determined with an insulin radioimmunoassay kit (BIOTRAK, Amersham Biosciences) using rat insulin as the standard. Tissue Sampling for Insulin Signaling Pathway Study—Mice were anesthetized after 24 h of starvation, and 5 units of human insulin (Humulin R, Lilly) were injected into the inferior vena cava. After 5 min, the liver and hindlimb muscles were removed, and the samples were then used for protein extraction as described above.

In brief, 4-5 days before the study, an infusion catheter was inserted into the right jugular vein under general anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital. Studies were performed on mice under conscious and unstressed conditions after a 6-h fast. A primed-continuous infusion of insulin (Humulin R; Lilly) was given (3.0 milliunits/kg/min for normal chow (NC) fed mice and 10.0 milliunits/kg/min for high fat (HF) diet-fed mice), and the blood glucose concentration, monitored every 5 min, was maintained at ∼120 mg/dl by administration of glucose (5 g of glucose/10 ml enriched to ∼20% with [6,6-2H2]glucose (Sigma)) for 120 min. Blood was sampled via tail-tip bleeds at 90, 105, and 120 min for determination of the rate of glucose disappearance (Rd). Rd was calculated according to non-steady-state equations (29Suzuki R.

The majority of melanomas that occur on skin with little evidence of chronic sun-induced damage (non-CSD melanoma) have mutations in the BRAF oncogene, whereas in melanomas on skin with marked CSD (CSD melanoma) these mutations are less frequent. In two independent Caucasian populations, we show that MC1R variants are strongly associated with BRAF mutations in non-CSD melanomas. In this tumor subtype, the risk for melanoma associated with MC1R is due to an increase in risk of developing melanomas with BRAF mutations."

We demonstrate that netrins stimulate proliferation, migration, and tube formation of human endothelial cells in vitro and that this stimulation is independent of known netrin receptors. Suppression of netrin1a messenger RNA in zebrafish inhibits vascular sprouting, implying a proangiogenic role for netrins during vertebrate development. We also show that netrins accelerate neovascularization in an in vivo model of ischemia and that they reverse neuropathy and vasculopathy in a diabetic murine model. We propose that the attractive vascular and neural guidance functions of netrins offer a unique therapeutic potential."

https://openalex.org/W2052191937,We found an extraordinary level of bacterial biodiversity in the tree leaf canopy of a tropical Atlantic forest by using culture-independent molecular methods. Our survey suggests that each tree species selects for a distinct microbial community. Analysis of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences revealed that about 97% of the bacteria were unknown species and that the phyllosphere of any one tree species carries at least 95 to 671 bacterial species. The tree canopies of tropical forests likely represent a large reservoir of unexplored microbial diversity.
https://openalex.org/W2137587206,"Abstract The amyloid β peptide (Aβ), composed of 40 or 42 amino acids, is a critical component in the etiology of the neurodegenerative Alzheimer disease. Aβ is prone to aggregate and forms amyloid fibrils progressively both in vitro and in vivo. To understand the process of amyloidogenesis, it is pivotal to examine the initial stages of the folding process. We examined the equilibrium folding properties, assembly states, and stabilities of the early folding stages of Aβ40 and Aβ42 prior to fibril formation. We found that Aβ40 and Aβ42 have different conformations and assembly states upon refolding from their unfolded ensembles. Aβ40 is predominantly an unstable and collapsed monomeric species, whereas Aβ42 populates a stable structured trimeric or tetrameric species at concentrations above ∼12.5 μm. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the free energies of Aβ40 monomer and Aβ42 trimer/tetramer are ∼1.1 and ∼15/∼22 kcal/mol, respectively. The early aggregation stages of Aβ40 and Aβ42 contain different solvent-exposed hydrophobic surfaces that are located at the sequences flanking its protease-resistant segment. The amyloidogenic folded structure of Aβ is important for the formation of spherical β oligomeric species. However, β oligomers are not an obligatory intermediate in the process of fibril formation because oligomerization is inhibited at concentrations of urea that have no effect on fibril formation. The distinct initial folding properties of Aβ40 and Aβ42 may play an important role in the higher aggregation potential and pathological significance of Aβ42."
https://openalex.org/W2163897029,"Exposure to pesticides has been suggested to increase the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the mechanisms responsible for this association are not clear. Here, we report that perinatal exposure of mice during gestation and lactation to low levels of dieldrin (0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg every 3 days) alters dopaminergic neurochemistry in their offspring and exacerbates MPTP toxicity. At 12 wk of age, protein and mRNA levels of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) were increased by perinatal dieldrin exposure in a dose-related manner. We then administered MPTP (2 x 10 mg/kg s.c) at 12 wk of age and observed a greater reduction of striatal dopamine in dieldrin-exposed offspring, which was associated with a greater DAT:VMAT2 ratio. Additionally, dieldrin exposure during development potentiated the increase in GFAP and alpha-synuclein levels induced by MPTP, indicating increased neurotoxicity. In all cases there were greater effects observed in the male offspring than the female, similar to that observed in human cases of PD. These data suggest that developmental exposure to dieldrin leads to persistent alterations of the developing dopaminergic system and that these alterations induce a ""silent"" state of dopamine dysfunction, thereby rendering dopamine neurons more vulnerable later in life."
https://openalex.org/W2167679198,"Normal blood microvessels are lined by pericytes, which contribute to microvessel development and stability through mechanisms that are poorly understood. Pericyte deficiency has been implicated in the pathogenesis of microvascular abnormalities associated with diabetes and tumors. However, the unambiguous identification of pericytes is still a problem because of cellular heterogeneity and few available molecular markers. Here we describe an approach to identify pericyte markers based on transcription profiling of pericyte-deficient brain microvessels isolated from platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-B)-/- and PDGF beta receptor (PDGFRbeta)-/- mouse mutants. The approach was validated by the identification of known pericyte markers among the most down-regulated genes in PDGF-B-/- and PDGFRbeta-/- microvessels. Of candidates for novel pericyte markers, we selected ATP-sensitive potassium-channel Kir6.1 (also known as Kcnj8) and sulfonylurea receptor 2, (SUR2, also known as Abcc9), both part of the same channel complex, as well as delta homologue 1 (DLK1) for in situ hybridization, which demonstrated their specific expression in brain pericytes of mouse embryos. We also show that Kir6.1 is highly expressed in pericytes in brain but undetectable in pericytes in skin and heart. The three new brain pericyte markers are signaling molecules implicated in ion transport and intercellular signaling, potentially opening new windows on pericyte function in brain microvessels."
https://openalex.org/W1991443329,"Inhibition of viruses at the stage of viral entry provides a route for therapeutic intervention. Because of difficulties in propagating hepatitis C virus (HCV) in cell culture, entry inhibitors have not yet been reported for this virus. However, with the development of retroviral particles pseudotyped with HCV envelope glycoproteins (HCVpp) and the recent progress in amplification of HCV in cell culture (HCVcc), studying HCV entry is now possible. In addition, these systems are essential for the identification and the characterization of molecules that block HCV entry. The lectin cyanovirin-N (CV-N) has initially been discovered based on its potent activity against human immunodeficiency virus. Because HCV envelope glycoproteins are highly glycosylated, we sought to determine whether CV-N has an antiviral activity against this virus. CV-N inhibited the infectivity of HCVcc and HCVpp at low nanomolar concentrations. This inhibition is attributed to the interaction of CV-N with HCV envelope glycoproteins. In addition, we showed that the carbohydrate binding property of CV-N is involved in the anti-HCV activity. Finally, CV-N bound to HCV envelope glycoproteins and blocked the interaction between the envelope protein E2 and CD81, a cell surface molecule involved in HCV entry. These data demonstrate that targeting the glycans of HCV envelope proteins is a promising approach in the development of antiviral therapies to combat a virus that is a major cause of chronic liver diseases.

More than 170 million people worldwide are chronically infected by hepatitis C virus (HCV) 4The abbreviations used are: HCV, hepatitis C virus; CV-N, cyanovirin-N; HCVpp, retroviral particles pseudotyped with HCV envelope glycoproteins; HCVcc, HCV produced in cell culture; Man, mannose; E1, envelope glycoprotein 1; E2, envelope glycoprotein 2; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; mAb, monoclonal antibody. (1Wasley A. Alter M.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This virus is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (2Major M.E. Rehermann B. Feinstone S.M. Hepatitis C viruses.in: Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001Google Scholar). In addition, chronic HCV infection has become the most common indication for liver transplantation. Current antiviral therapy is based on the use of polyethylene glycol-modified interferon-α in combination with ribavirin. However, this treatment is expensive, relatively toxic, and effective in only half of the treated patients (3Feld J.J. Hoofnagle J.H. Nature. 2005; 436: 967-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is as yet no vaccine against HCV. Therefore, more efficacious and better tolerated anti-HCV treatments are sorely needed to combat this major pathogen. HCV is an enveloped virus that belongs to the Hepacivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family (4Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Flaviviridae: The Viruses and Their Replication.in: Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa2001Google Scholar). Because of difficulties in propagating HCV in cell culture, many gaps remain in our understanding of the HCV life cycle. A major advance in the investigation of HCV entry was the development of pseudoparticles (HCVpp), consisting of native HCV envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 assembled onto retroviral core particles (5Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 6Hsu M. Zhang J. Flint M. Logvinoff C. Cheng-Mayer C. Rice C.M. McKeating J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

This system is potentially very powerful to identify and characterize molecules that block HCV entry. Furthermore, data obtained with HCVpp can also now be confirmed with the help of the recently developed cell culture system that allows efficient amplification of HCV (HCVcc) (8Wakita T.

During their biogenesis, the two envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 assemble as a noncovalent heterodimer, which is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (11Deleersnyder V. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Blight K. Xu J. Hahn Y.S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this compartment, four or five potential glycosylation sites on E1 and up to 11 sites on E2 are modified by N-linked glycosylation (12Goffard A. Dubuisson J. Biochimie.

Wakita (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience, Tokyo, Japan), was used to generate HCVcc as described previously (8Wakita T. Pietschmann T. Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Zhao Z. Murthy K. Habermann A. Krausslich H.G. Mizokami M. Bartenschlager R. Liang T.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). In brief, the pJFH1 plasmid was linearized and used as a template for in vitro transcription with the MEGAscript kit from Ambion. In vitro transcribed RNA was delivered to Huh-7 cells by electroporation, and viral stocks were obtained by harvesting cell culture supernatants at 3 to 4 days post-transfection. Secondary viral stocks were obtained by additional amplifications on naïve Huh-7 cells (34Rouillé Y. Helle F. Delgrange D. Roingeard P. Voisset C. Blanchard E. Belouzard S. McKeating J. Patel A. Maertens G. Wakita T. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 2832-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation Assay—HCVpp were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h in the presence or absence of CV-N (0.6 μg/ml). HCVpp were then lysed using 1% Triton X-100. CV-N was immunoprecipitated using the anti-CV-N polyclonal antibody. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100, eluted in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-E1 (A4) and anti-E2 (H47) mAbs. Protein Deglycosylation—HCVpp were concentrated on a 20% sucrose cushion and denatured in denaturation buffer (0.5% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) by boiling for 15 min at 95 °C. The protein samples were then divided into two equal portions: one for digestion with peptide N-glycosidase F and one for an undigested control. Digestion was carried out for 2 h at 37 °C in the buffer provided by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). CD81 Pulldown Assay—HCVpp were incubated for 2 h with increasing amounts of CV-N. HCVpp were then lysed by the addition of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100. HCV envelope glycoproteins were pulled down using a recombinant fusion protein containing the large extracellular loop of human CD81 fused to glutathione S-transferase (CD81-LEL) (35Higginbottom A. Quinn E.R. Kuo C.C. Flint M. Wilson L.H. Bianchi E. Nicosia A. Monk P.N. McKeating J.A. Levy S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3642-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) preadsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Precipitates were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100, eluted in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-E1 (A4) and anti-E2 (H47) mAbs. CV-N Inhibits HCVcc and HCVpp Infectivity—To determine the effect of CV-N on HCV infectivity, we first tested the capacity of HCVcc to infect Huh-7 cells in the presence of increasing amounts of CV-N. HCVcc infectivity was measured by analyzing the levels of expression of HCV glycoprotein E2. As shown in Fig. 1A, E2 expression decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of CV-N, indicating that CV-N inhibits HCVcc infectivity. Importantly, CV-N was active at low nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, adding CV-N at 3 h postinfection had no effect on HCVcc infectivity, indicating that CV-N blocks an early step of the HCV life cycle (Fig. 1A). To confirm the effect of CV-N on virus entry, we analyzed its antiviral effect on HCVpp. As shown in Fig. 1B, HCVpp infectivity was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of CV-N (EC50 = 1.6 ± 0.1 nm corresponding to 17.6 ng/ml). In addition, CV-N had only a slight effect on HCVpp infectivity when added at 3 h postinfection, confirming that it blocked the entry step (Fig. 1C). CV-N had no antiviral activity against particles pseudotyped with the envelope glycoprotein G of vesicular stomatitis virus at the highest concentration tested (Fig. 1D), confirming that the antiviral activity of HCVpp is specific for the presence of HCV envelope glycoproteins on the pseudotyped particles. It is worth noting that CV-N had similar antiviral activity on HCVpp generated with envelope glycoproteins from different genotypes (Fig. 2), indicating that the anti-HCV activity of CV-N is broad. It is important to note that no increase in cell mortality was observed in the presence of CV-N at the highest concentration tested. Because CV-N had a similar effect on both HCVcc and HCVpp entry, the antiviral activity of CV-N was further studied with the HCVpp system, which is a more convenient tool for the characterization of HCV entry. CV-N Interacts with E1E2 Heterodimers—The inhibitory effect of CV-N on HCVpp and HCVcc may potentially be attributed to CV-N interaction with either target cells or viral particles. To investigate whether CV-N inhibits HCVpp entry by affecting the cell, Huh-7 cells were incubated with CV-N prior to infection. However, preincubation of Huh-7 cells with CV-N (0.1 μg/ml) had only a minor effect on HCVpp entry (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the anti-HCV activity of CV-N is probably due to an effect on viral particles. The slight effect of CV-N added to the cells before infection might be due to the binding of CV-N to a cell surface molecule involved in HCV entry. To test whether the anti-HCV activity of CV-N is due to an effect on viral particles, CV-N and HCVpp were incubated before contact with target cells. In these conditions, CV-N should have more time to bind to HCVpp and hence have a stronger antiviral activity. In contrast, the antiviral activity of CV-N should not be modified in these conditions if CV-N does not interact with the particles. As shown in Fig. 3B, the anti-HCV activity of CV-N was greater when CV-N was preincubated with HCVpp, suggesting that CV-N interacts directly with HCVpp and thereby reduces their infectivity. We suspected that, because of its capacity to bind to N-linked glycans, the anti-HCV effect of this protein might be explained by an interaction between CV-N and HCV envelope glycoproteins. To determine whether CV-N interacts with E1E2 heterodimers, the presence of complexes involving CV-N and E1E2 was analyzed in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. After immunoprecipitation with an anti-CV-N antibody, the presence of E1E2 heterodimers in the immunoprecipitates was analyzed by Western blotting with specific mAbs. As shown in Fig. 4, HCV envelope glycoproteins were detected after immunoprecipitation with the anti-CV-N antibody, indicating that HCV envelope glycoproteins interact with CV-N. In contrast, neither E1 nor E2 was detected in the absence of CV-N. These results allowed us to demonstrate that CV-N specifically interacts with E1E2 heterodimers. CV-N Interacts with N-linked Glycans of HCV Envelope Glycoproteins—Because CV-N interacts with N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides Man-8 and Man-9 (21O'Keefe B.R. Shenoy S.R. Xie D. Zhang W.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and E1E2 heterodimers contain this type of glycan, we sought to determine whether such interactions can be responsible for the anti-HCV activity of CV-N. As a first approach, we treated HCVpp envelope glycoproteins with peptide N-glycosidase F to remove the glycans associated with HCV envelope glycoproteins. Interestingly, interaction between CV-N and HCV envelope proteins was abolished after this enzymatic deglycosylation (Fig. 5A), indicating that CV-N interacts with the N-linked glycans of HCV envelope glycoproteins. We also investigated the capacity of Man-9 to reduce the anti-HCV activity of CV-N. To this end, we analyzed whether the infectivity of HCVpp would be modified in the presence of CV-N (0.1 μg/ml) incubated with increasing amounts of Man-9. Interestingly, Man-9 restored HCVpp infectivity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). It is worth noting that, at the highest concentration tested, Man-9 alone had no effect on HCVpp infectivity (Fig. 5B). In addition, preincubation of CV-N with Man-9 also reduced the interaction between CV-N and HCV envelope glycoproteins in our coimmunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 5C). Unfortunately, our previously reported glycosylation mutants (13Goffard A. Callens N. Bartosch B. Wychowski C. Cosset F.L. Montpellier-Pala C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8400-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) did not allow us to identify the specific glycan(s) on HCV envelope glycoprotein that bind CV-N. This is probably due to the fact that CV-N binds to several glycans on HCV envelope glycoproteins. Altogether, our results indicate that the anti-HCV activity of CV-N is the result of its interaction with N-linked glycans associated with HCV envelope glycoproteins. CV-N Inhibits E2-CD81 Interaction—Because CV-N interacts with E1E2 heterodimers via their glycans, this compound might interfere with critical interactions between viral envelopes and cell-surface molecules that are required for virus entry into target cell. The best characterized molecule involved in HCV entry is CD81 (26Cocquerel L. Voisset C. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which has been shown to interact with HCV glycoprotein E2 (36Pileri P. Uematsu Y. Campagnoli S. Galli G. Falugi F. Petracca R. Weiner A.J. Houghton M. Rosa D. Grandi G. Abrignani S. Science. 1998; 282: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether CV-N is able to prevent the interaction of E1E2 heterodimers with this cellular protein. To this end, HCVpp were incubated for 2 h with increasing amounts of CV-N, and the interactions between E1E2 heterodimers and CD81 were analyzed in a pulldown assay using a glutathione S-transferase protein fused to the large extracellular loop of human CD81 (CD81-LEL). As shown in Fig. 6, CV-N reduced E1E2-CD81-LEL interaction in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that CV-N inhibits the binding of E1E2 to one of its potential receptors. It is worth noting that CV-N did not interact with CD81-LEL preadsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose beads (data not shown). These results indicate that CV-N interacts with E1E2 heterodimers and prevents the interaction between E2 and the large extracellular loop of CD81, suggesting that CV-N blocks HCV entry by inhibiting the contact between HCV envelope glycoproteins and CD81. Inhibition of viruses at the stage of viral entry provides a route for therapeutic intervention, as evidenced by the recent development of inhibitors of HIV entry (37Matthews T. Salgo M. Greenberg M. Chung J. DeMasi R. Bolognesi D. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Because of difficulties in propagating HCV in cell culture, entry inhibitors have not yet been reported for this virus. However, thanks to the recent development of HCVpp and HCVcc systems, studying HCV entry is now possible, and these systems are essential tools for the identification and characterization of molecules that block HCV entry. Here, we investigated the potential anti-HCV activity of CV-N. Our data show that CV-N interacts with N-linked glycans associated with HCV envelope glycoproteins, which leads to an inhibition of interaction between HCV glycoprotein E2 and CD81. Importantly, CV-N is active against HCV at low nanomolar concentrations and has a broad effect, because it is able to inhibit entry of various genotypes. This report is a proof-of-concept that HCV glycans are an interesting target for the development of new antiviral molecules that block HCV entry. Furthermore, CV-N is a new invaluable tool to further dissect the early steps of HCV entry into host cells. The binding of CV-N to N-linked glycans on HCV envelope glycoproteins inhibits E2-CD81 interaction. Because N-linked glycans might not be necessary for E2 binding to CD81 (38Heile J.M. Fong Y.L. Rosa D. Berger K. Saletti G. Campagnoli S. Bensi G. Capo S. Coates S. Crawford K. Dong C. Wininger M. Baker G. Cousens L. Chien D. Ng P. Archangel P. Grandi G. Houghton M. Abrignani S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6885-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), it is likely that the binding of CV-N to the glycans of HCV envelope glycoproteins masks the CD81 binding site on E2 by steric hindrance. This also suggests that one or several high-mannose glycans surround the CD81 binding site on E2. However, due to the absence of a three-dimensional structure for HCV envelope glycoproteins, we do not know the spatial relationship between HCV glycans and the CD81 binding site. Interestingly, the extracellular form of a truncated E2 glycoprotein is less efficient than its intracellular form to interact with CD81, and it has been proposed to be due to the processing of some oligomannoses into complex-type glycans (38Heile J.M. Fong Y.L. Rosa D. Berger K. Saletti G. Campagnoli S. Bensi G. Capo S. Coates S. Crawford K. Dong C. Wininger M. Baker G. Cousens L. Chien D. Ng P. Archangel P. Grandi G. Houghton M. Abrignani S. J.

Virol. 2000; 74: 702-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that these glycans are processed in the context of the E1E2 heterodimer. Indeed, the processing of E2 glycans is different when E1 and E2 do not assemble as a heterodimer (40Ciczora Y. Callens N. Montpellier C. Bartosch B. Cosset F.L. Op de Beeck A. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 2793-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that a slight increase in steric hindrance can already affect E2-CD81 interaction, indicating that small antiviral molecules targeting HCV glycans can potentially be designed. As for HIV, the development of resistance against drugs that target the glycans on HCV glycoproteins will probably result in mutations in some glycosylation sites (41Balzarini J. Van Laethem K.

Pannecouque C. O'Keefe B R. McMahon J. Stamatatos L. de Clercq E. Bolmstedt A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 7777-7784Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, most of the glycosylation sites are strongly conserved in HCV (12Goffard A. Dubuisson J. Biochimie. (Paris). 2003; 85: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 43Zhang M. Gaschen B. Blay W. Foley B. Haigwood N. Kuiken C. Korber B. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 1229-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and, contrary to HIV, shifts in terms of the relative position of the glycans are seldom observed for HCV glycans (43Zhang M. Gaschen B. Blay W. Foley B. Haigwood N. Kuiken C. Korber B. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 1229-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In addition, some HCV glycans have been shown to play a role in virus entry (13Goffard A. Callens N. Bartosch B. Wychowski C. Cosset F.L. Montpellier-Pala C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8400-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Therefore, adaptation of HCV to the selective pressure of CV-N will be more difficult than it is for HIV. In the case of HIV, CV-N has been shown to have considerable potential for development as a prophylactic topical microbicide to prevent sexual transmission (44Barrientos L.G. Gronenborn A.M. Mini. Rev. Med. Chem. 2005; 5: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, in the context of HCV infection, CV-N would need to reach the systemic circulation for the treatment of HCV-infected patients to have an antiviral activity. In the context of an experimental infection of mice with Ebola virus, CV-N has been shown to reach the systemic circulation and exhibit measurable activity (45Barrientos L.G. O'Keefe B.R. Bray M. Sanchez A. Gronenborn A.M. Boyd M.R. Antiviral Res. 2003; 58: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), suggesting that this drug can cross several physiological compartments after subcutaneous injection. CV-N might therefore be functional in inhibiting HCV in infected patients; however, further pharmacokinetic analyses in animal models are needed to determine the tissue distribution of CV-N. Inhibitors of virus entry, such as CV-N, will reinforce the arsenal against HCV. The recent resolution of the three-dimensional structure of various HCV components and the development of in vitro assays to assess the antiviral potency of molecules targeting these elements have made it possible to screen and develop specific small inhibitory molecules (46De Francesco R. Migliaccio G. Nature. 2005; 436: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Currently, the major targets of new antivirals are the HCV internal ribosome entry site, NS3 serine protease, and NS5B, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Although a small number of compounds have started to show promising results in early-phase clinical trials, preclinical evidence is accumulating, demonstrating that development of resistance will eventually limit the efficacy of these new drugs (47Pawlotsky J.M. Hepatology. 2006; 43: S207-S220Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This is due to the fact that HCV is a highly variable virus with rapid viral kinetics, large population sizes, and a quasispecies distribution (48Pawlotsky J.M. Clin. Liver Dis. 2003; 7: 45-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Therefore, combinations of multiple drugs with different targets will be required to treat chronic hepatitis C. Blocking virus entry by a compound, such as CV-N, offers a new opportunity to develop a highly active antiviral combination for the treatment of chronic HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2068261932,"In this study, we have identified the Forkhead transcription factor FoxM1 as a physiological regulator of estrogen receptor α (ERα) expression in breast carcinoma cells. Our survey of a panel of 16 different breast cell lines showed a good correlation (13/16) between FoxM1 expression and expression of ERα at both protein and mRNA levels. We have also demonstrated that ectopic expression of FoxM1 in two different estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and ZR-75–30, led to up-regulation of ERα expression at protein and transcript levels. Furthermore, treatment of MCF-7 cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126, which blocks ERK1/2-dependent activation of FoxM1, also repressed ERα expression. Consistent with this, silencing of FoxM1 expression in MCF-7 cells using small interfering RNA resulted in the almost complete abrogation of ERα expression. We also went on to show that FoxM1 can activate the transcriptional activity of human ERα promoter primarily through two closely located Forkhead response elements located at the proximal region of the ERα promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and biotinylated oligonucleotide pulldown assays have allowed us to confirm these Forkhead response elements as important for FoxM1 binding. Further co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that FoxO3a and FoxM1 interact in vivo. Together with the chromatin immunoprecipitation and biotinylated oligonucleotide pulldown data, the co-immunoprecipitation results also suggest the possibility that FoxM1 and FoxO3a cooperate to regulate ERα gene transcription.

Estrogen receptors play a major role in regulating the growth, survival, and differentiation of normal and malignant breast epithelial cells. In normal mammary epithelium, ERs are rarely expressed in a large proportion of cells or at high levels (4Khan S.A. Rogers M.A. Khurana K.K. Meguid M.M. Numann P.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 5Ricketts D. Turnbull L. Ryall G. Bakhshi R. Rawson N.S. Gazet J.C. Nolan C. Coombes R.C. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1817-1822PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 60–80% of all breast cancers overexpress ERα, and ∼70% of those respond to endocrine treatment, with further increased risk of breast cancer development in benign mammary tissue. These findings suggest that ERα plays a major role in breast cancer initiation and progression (4Khan S.A. Rogers M.A. Khurana K.K. Meguid M.M. Numann P.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). ERβ appears to have an opposing function to ERα in tumor growth (6Gustafsson J.A. Warner M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and low levels of ERα predict resistance to Tamoxifen therapy in breast cancer (7Hopp T.A. Weiss H.L. Parra I.S. Cui Y. Osborne C.K. Fuqua S.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 7490-7499Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). ERα functions as a classical transcription factor as well as a signal transducer. Estrogen binding activates ERα through phosphorylation, dissociates it from chaperonin proteins, and alters its conformation. Several kinases in the mitogenic signaling pathways can also phosphorylate and consequently activate ERα through a ligand-independent manner. Hormone-bound ERs dimerize and bind to estrogen response elements present in the promoter regions of target genes, including c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, TGF-α, retinoic acid receptor α1, and progesterone receptor A, etc., to activate gene transcription (8Hyder S.M.

ERα has also been shown to modulate gene transcription through alternative regulatory DNA sequences, such as AP-1, NF-κB, and Sp-1 binding sites (13Ali S. Coombes R.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Many of these ER-regulated genes, including IGFR1, cyclin D1, c-myc, and the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2, are important for cell proliferation and survival (14Altucci L. Addeo R. Cicatiello L.

Direct binding of ERα to a diversity of membrane/cytoplasmic signaling molecules have been observed, and they include the p85 regulatory subunit of class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Src tyrosine kinase, and the insulin-like growth factor 1 (13Ali S. Coombes R.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Activation of these pathways by estrogen through the ER initiates cell survival and proliferation signals via phosphorylation and activation of Akt and MAPK. Additionally, these signaling molecules are able to phosphorylate the ER and its co-regulators to augment nuclear ER signaling (13Ali S. Coombes R.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In summary, the genomic and non-genomic actions of ERα play a crucial role in breast epithelial cell proliferation and survival. Endocrine therapies aimed at blocking the action of estrogens have been the most effective and widely used methods for treating ERα-positive breast cancers. These therapeutic approaches involve blocking estrogen binding to ER using antiestrogens such as tamoxifen, inhibiting estrogen synthesis using aromatase inhibitors such as exemestane, and reducing ER protein levels using “pure” anti-estrogens such as fluvestrant (ICI 182,780 or Faslodex) (13Ali S. Coombes R.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a proportion of ERα-positive tumors do not respond to hormone treatment at all (de novo resistance), and the majority of those that initially respond eventually become resistant (acquired resistance). Most resistant tumors remain ERα-positive, indicating a continued role for ERα in breast cancer cell survival and proliferation (18Coombes R.C. Powles T.J. Berger U. Wilson P. McClelland R.A.

Coombes R.C. Br. J. Cancer. 1982; 45: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A recent study suggested that ERα transcription is regulated by FoxO3a (Forkhead box class O, 3a), a member of the Forkhead family of transcription factors (20Guo S. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8681-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). FoxO3a activity is negatively regulated by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway. Activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase by growth factors leads to phosphorylation and inactivation of FoxO3a by Akt (also termed PKB (protein kinase B)) (21Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z.

When activated, FoxO3a up-regulates p27Kip1, p130, and bim and down-regulates cyclin D1/2 and bcl-XL expression to mediate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (22Fernandez de Mattos S. Essafi A.

Because ERα expression is associated with breast cancer initiation and progression and FoxO3a activation with cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, it is implausible that FoxO3a would be the principal positive regulator of ERα transcription. Because all members of the Forkhead transcription factors share a similar DNA binding domain, we reasoned that other family member(s) could be the main physiological regulator(s) of ERα transcription. Forkhead box (Fox) M1 is a transcription factor ubiquitously expressed in proliferating cells and a key regulator of both G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (26Laoukili J. Kooistra M.R. Bras A.

In this study, we have examined the possibility that FoxM1 regulates ERα expression and explored the mechanism involved. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Cell Lines—The human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7, ZR-75–1, ZR-75–30, 734 B, MDA-MB-175, CAMA1, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-469, HMT 3552, HBL-100, SKBR-3, SKBR-7, BT-474, BT-549, T47-D, and CAL-51 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 10% CO2 at 37 °C. MCF-7 Tet-on FoxM1 cells were selected and maintained in the presence of 500 μg/ml of zeocin (Invitrogen). Plasmids—The FoxO3a expression vector pLPC-FoxO3a(wt) and pLPC-FoxO3a(A3) and the FoxM1 expression vector pcDNA3-FoxM1 have previously been described (22Fernandez de Mattos S. Essafi A. Soeiro I.

The psiRNA-FoxO3a expression vector was generated by cloning small synthetic oligonucleotides encoding two complementary sequences of 19 nucleotides, TCACTGCATAGTCGATTCA, into the Invivogen psiRNA plasmid (Autogen Bioclear, Wiltshire, UK). The pTER-FoxM1 siRNA expression vector was generated by cloning the two complementary hairpin sequences of CACGCAAGTAGTGGCCATC into the BglII and HindIII sites of the pTER vector provided by Dr. Marc van de Wetering (Department of Immunology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands) (34van de Wetering M.

The respective control RNA interference vectors were generated from nucleotide sequences with the middle 2 bases mutated (i.e. FoxM1-TCACTGCCCAGTCGATTCA and FoxO3a-TCACTGCACCGTCGATTCA). The pcDNA4-FoxM1 vector used for the establishment of MCF-7 Tet-on FoxM1 MCF-7 cells was generated by PCR amplification of the human FoxM1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number U83113) using a high-fidelity polymerase (Clontech) and subcloning into the HindIII/XbaI restriction sites of pcDNA4™4T/O (Invitrogen) mammalian expression plasmid. Western Blotting and Antibodies—Western blotting was performed on whole cell extracts prepared by lysing cells with a 2× packed cell volume of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors (“Complete” protease inhibitor mixture)), as instructed by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad Dc protein assay. 25 μg of protein was size-fractionated using SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Schliecher & Schuell). Antibodies recognizing FoxO3a phosphorylated at Thr-32 and total FoxO3a (06–951) were purchased from Upstate (Dundee, UK). Mouse monoclonal antibody against FoxO3a (F-1304) was purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against p27Kip1 (C-19), Bim (H-191), Cdc25b, Cdc25c (C-20), cyclin B1 (H-433), Plk (F-8), actin (I-19), FoxM1 (C-20), FoxM1 (H-300), and ERα (F-10) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), total MAPK, phospho-Akt (Ser-473), and total Akt were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Hitchin, UK). Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse, anti-goat, or anti-rabbit conjugates (DAKO, Ely, UK), as appropriate, and visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm sodium molibdate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and Complete Mini protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) for 15 min on ice. The cell lysates were precleared for 1 h with protein G-Sepharose, incubated with specific antibodies for 1 h, and then with 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose for 1 h. The beads were washed five times with 500 μl of lysis buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Promoter Assay—MCF-7 cells were cultured in 96-well plates until 60% confluent. The cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions for 24 h, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and then harvested for firefly/Renilla luciferase assays using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Southampton, UK). Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis of putative Forkhead binding sites of the ERα promoter was carried out using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK). The sequences for primers used for creating point mutations and deletions are essentially those described for the DNA pulldown assays plus franking regions to give oligonucleotides of 42 bases. Real-time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Superscript first strand synthesis system for RT-qPCR (Invitrogen), and the resulting first strand cDNA was used as the template in the real-time quantitative PCR analysis. All measurements were performed in triplicate. The mRNAs analyzed were FoxO3a, FoxM1, ERα, and GAPDH, which served as an internal control and was used to normalize for variances in input cDNA. The following gene-specific primer pairs were designed using the ABI Primer Express software: FoxO3a-sense, 5′-TCTACGAGTGGATGGTGCGTT-3′ and FoxO3a-antisense, 5′-CGACTATGCAGTGACAGGTTGTG-3′; FoxM1-sense, 5′-TGCAGCTAGGGATGTGAATCTTC-3′ and FoxM1-antisense, 5′-GGAGCCCAGTCCATCAGAACT-3′; ERα-sense, 5′-CAGATGGTCAGTGCCTTGTTGG-3′ and ERα-antisense, 5′-CCAAGAGCAAGTTAGGAGCAAACAG-3′; GAPDH-sense, 5′-TCCCATCACCATCTTCCA-3′ and GAPDH-antisense, 5′-CATCACGCCACAGTTTCC-3′. The specificity of each primer was determined using the NCBI BLAST software module. Detection of FoxO3a, FoxM1, and ERα transcription was performed with SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems, Brackley, UK) and an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, UK) using the relative standard curve method. Gene Silencing with Small Interfering RNAs—MCF-7 cells cultured in 100-mm plates were transfected with 15 μg of pTER-FoxM1siRNA or psi-FoxO3a plasmid using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were collected 72 h after transfection either for Western blot analysis or RT-qPCR. Immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm sodium molibdate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and Complete Mini protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) for 15 min on ice. The cell lysates were precleared for 1 h with protein G-Sepharose and incubated with specific antibodies for 1 h and then with 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose for 1 h. The beads were washed five times with 500 μl of lysis buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was performed as described previously (25Essafi A. Fernandez de Mattos S. Hassen Y.A. Soeiro I. Mufti G.J. Thomas N.S. Medema R.H. Lam E.W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2317-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) using MCF-7 cells grown to 70% confluence. DNA fragments were purified using the QIAquick Spin Kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). For PCR, one-twenty-fifth of the extracted DNA was used and amplified in 25 PCR cycles using specific primers. The following primers were used: B1-sense(–3215/–3193), 5′-AGGCACCACTGTCACCAACAAA-3′ and B1-antisense(–2887/–2865), 5′-AAGCCTCCATTGGGTGTCATGT-3′; B2-sense(–2755/–2731), 5′-CCACTGGGAAATGAGAGACCTCGT-3′ and B2-antisense(–2438/–2414), 5′-GGGCCAGTAAGGCATTTGATCCAC-3′; A1-sense(–1018/–994), 5′-TCCTAGCCCAAGTGAACCGAGAAG-3′ and A1-antisense(–637/–613), 5′-AGAGGAAGAAACTGAGGTCCTGGC-3′; A2-sense(–437/–417), 5′-GTAGTCCTCCCCAGGGTCAT-3′ and A2-antisense(–244/–224), 5′-CCTTTAGCAGATCCTCGTGC-3′; and A3-sense(–210/–190), 5′-GCCGTGAAACTCAGCCTCTA-3′ and A3-antisense(–46/–26), 5′-TACTGGTCTCCCGAGCTCAT-3′. Biotinylated Oligonucleotide Pulldown Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cells using the high-salt buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and Complete Mini protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) as described previously. After diluting with 2 volumes of low-salt lysis buffer without NaCl, 50 μg of the cell extracts were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with either 0.1 nmol of the 5′-biotinylated double-stranded wild-type or mutant oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) previously coupled to streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) in the presence or absence of an appropriate amount of competitor non-biotinylated oligonucleotides for 1 h at 4 °C and then for 10 min at 30 °C. The beads were washed six times with phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The sequences of oligonucleotides used for pulldown assays were as follows: S1S2-sense(–3174/–3138), 5′-CAATATTTATTTATATCCAGTATTTATTTTCAATAC-3′ and S1S2-mutsense, 5′-CAATATCTGTCTGTATCCAGTGTCTGTCTTCAATAC-3′; S4-sense(–2631/–2595), 5′-ATTTTTCACATGTTTACAGAAAGCAGTCAACTGAGC-3′ and S4-mutsense, 5′-GTCTTCCACACTTCTGCAGAAAGCAGTCAACTGAGC-3′; S5-sense, 5′-GTACTGTGGTCCAACATAAACACACAAGTCAGGCTGAG-3′ and S5-mutsense, 5′-GTACTGTGGTCCAACCTTCTGCACAAGTCAGGCTGAG-3′; S6S7-sense(–385/–313), 5′-GAGGAGGGGGAATCAAACAGAAAGAGAGACAAACAGAGATATATC-3′ and S6S7-mutsense, 5′-GAGGAGGGGGGGGCGGGCAGAGAGAGGGGCGGGCAGAGATATATC-3′; S8-sense(–130/–84), 5′-ATCGAGTTGTGCCTGGAGTGATGTTTAAGCCAATGTCAGGGCAAGG-3′ and S8-mutsense, 5′-ATCGAGTTGTGCCTGGAGTGGGGGCCGGGCCGGGGGCAGGGCAAGG-3′. FoxM1, but Not FoxO3a, Expression Correlates with ERα Expression at the Transcriptional Level in Breast Cancer Cell Lines—To explore the possibility that FoxM1 regulates ERα expression, we first analyzed the correlation between the levels of expression of FoxM1 or FoxO3a and ERα in a panel of 16 different breast cell lines by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, 13 of the 16 breast carcinoma cell lines showed good correlations between the levels of FoxM1 and ERα expression. In contrast, only 6 of the 16 cell lines demonstrated positive correlation between the levels of FoxO3a and ERα expression. We next examined the mRNA levels of ERα in these cells by RT-qPCR (Fig. 1B). The result showed that, although the expression level of FoxM1 protein correlated with that of ERα mRNA in 13 of the 16 cell lines, only 6 of the 16 cell lines analyzed showed significant correlations between FoxO3a and ERα mRNA. Because the activity of FoxO3a is negatively regulated by Akt phosphorylation, the phosphorylation status of Akt was also studied using specific antibodies against phosphorylated and total Akt. The result again failed to account for the lack of correlation between FoxO3a and ERα expression. These data suggest that FoxM1, rather than FoxO3a, is the physiological regulator of ERα transcription in breast cancer cells. Ectopic Expression of FoxM1, but Not FoxO3a, Results in Up-regulation of ERα Expression—To test the hypothesis that FoxM1, but not FoxO3a, regulates ERα expression, we transiently transfected the ERα-positive breast cancer cell line ZR-75–30 with different amounts of expression plasmids encoding for FoxM1 and a constitutively active FoxO3a(A3) and analyzed the expression levels of ERα and known FoxM1 and FoxO3a targets at 48 h after transfection by Western blotting. These results showed that ectopic expression of FoxM1 increased the expression levels of the FoxM1 targets Plk and Cdc25c (Fig. 2A). We also observed a moderate but significant increase in ERα expression in the ZR-75–30 cells overexpressing FoxM1 but not those overexpressing FoxO3a(A3). To further investigate whether FoxM1 was regulating the transcription of ERα, we analyzed these cells by RT-qPCR. These results showed an ∼2-fold increase in ERα transcription when FoxM1 was overexpressed, which was not observed when FoxO3a(A3) was overexpressed (Fig. 2A). Induction of FoxM1 Expression in an MCF-7 Tet-on System Results in an Increase in the Levels of ERα Expression/Transcription—To further confirm that FoxM1 regulates ERα expression, we generated an MCF-7 cell line (MCF-7 Tet-on FoxM1) stably transfected with the pTet-On (Clontech) and pcDNA4-FoxM1 plasmids in which the FoxM1 expression was inducible by the addition of doxycycline. As shown in Fig. 2B, treatment of this cell line with 2 μg/ml doxycycline increased the expression of FoxM1 with time, and this was accompanied by an increase in the expression of ERα and known FoxM1 targets such as Cdc25c and Plk. There was a modest down-regulation of FoxM1 expression at 24 h, and this was probably because of the negative cell proliferative effect of doxycycline. Nevertheless, this was accompanied by a similar decline in ERα, Cdc25c, and Plk expression, further confirming our hypothesis that FoxM1 regulates ERα expression. Notably, the level of FoxO3a expression remained constant up to 48 h and declined moderately at 72 h after doxycycline treatment, suggesting that the induction of ERα by FoxM1 is not mediated through modulating FoxO3a expression. It is notable that the level of ERα induction was lower in the ZR-75–1 cells compared with the MCF7 cells. The reason is unclear, but it is likely to be due to the fact that not all of the ZR-75–1 cells would be expressing FoxM1 at high levels during transient transfection, whereas the MCF7 (Tet-on FoxM1) is a clonal cell line in which all of the cells would express FOXM1 at high levels following induction. Moreover, the low level of ERα expression in the ZR-75–30 cells might also be the result of post-transcriptional regulation. To further address whether the regulation of ERα by FoxM1 was at the transcriptional level, we analyzed the ERα RNA level by RT-qPCR. The result showed an increase in FoxM1 transcription of 3.5- and 7.0-fold at 48 and 72 h after treatment with doxycycline, correlating with 2.5- and 4.7-fold increases in ERα transcript level. Similarly, the FoxO3a mRNA level remained constant throughout the time course. These results indicate that FoxM1 regulates ERα expression at the transcription level in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Inhibition of FoxM1 Activity Leads to Down-regulation of ERα Expression—We next studied whether inhibition of FoxM1 activity would lead to down-regulation of ERα expression. To this end, we treated MCF-7 cells with 10 μm U0126 and performed a time course experiment as indicated in Fig. 3A. Western blot analysis showed down-regulation of the known FoxM1 targets Cdc25c and Cyclin B1 as early as 1 h after treatment. This was accompanied by a mobility shift and decrease in FoxM1 levels. The faster migration species of FoxM1 observed after treatment with U0126 probably reflects the dephosphorylated and inactive form of this protein. We also observed a similar down-regulation of ERα expression but only at 3 h after treatment. This probably highlights the fact that the half-life of ERα protein is longer than those of Cdc25c and cyclin B1. The levels of expression of FoxO3a and the FoxO3a targets Bim and p27Kip1 were constant throughout the time course, indicating that there was no change in FoxO3a activity. These results provide further evidence that FoxM1 is a physiological regulator of ERα expression in breast cancer cells. To extend these observations, we next studied the effects of FoxM1 and FoxO3a silencing on the expression of ERα in MCF-7 cells. To this end, we transfected siRNA vectors targeting FoxM1 or FoxO3a into MCF-7 cells and analyzed the protein expression at 72 h post-transfection by Western blotting. The results showed that abolishing F"

Here we solved the x-ray structure of HypB from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. It shows that the G-domain has a different topology than the Ras-like proteins and belongs to the SIMIBI (after Signal Recognition Particle, MinD and BioD) class of NTP-binding proteins. We show that HypB undergoes nucleotide-dependent dimerization, which is apparently a common feature of SIMIBI class G-proteins. The nucleotides are located in the dimer interface and are contacted by both subunits. The active site features residues from both subunits arguing that hydrolysis also requires dimerization. Two metal-binding sites are found, one of which is dependent on the state of bound nucleotide. A totally conserved ENV/IGNLV/ICP motif in switch II relays the nucleotide binding with the metal ionbinding site.

Maturation of nickel-containing enzymes, like carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, urease, or hydrogenase, requires participation of numerous accessory proteins. Sequencing of several bacterial genomes combined with genetic and biochemical analysis revealed a set of such proteins for each metalloenzyme (1Ermler U. Grabarse W. Shima S. Goubeaud M. Thauer R.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 2Mulrooney S.B. Hausinger R.P. FEMS Microb. Rev. 2003; 27: 239-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Although the basic functions of nickel storage, GTP hydrolysis-dependent nickel mobilization, and nickel insertion have been demonstrated, the specific steps performed by these proteins in the assembly of the active site are not completely understood (3Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 279-286Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the case of hydrogenases, the generation of active enzyme that also involves nickel incorporation is achieved by the activities of six proteins designated HypA-F (4Lutz S. Jacobi A. Schlensog V. Böhm R. Sawers G. Böck A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In most organisms the corresponding genes are encoded in a single operon. However, genes for additional maturation proteins, also including a maturation endopeptidase, are normally organized in an operon that also houses the hydrogenase structural genes (5Maier T. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10089-10093Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Two of these auxiliary proteins, namely HypA and HypB, are required for the nickel insertion reaction as judged by the fact that the deficiency of hypA and hypB mutants in hydrogenase maturation could be complemented chemically by the addition of nickel to the medium in high concentrations or by the addition of the metal to maturation assays employing crude extracts (6Waugh R. Boxer D.H. Biochimie (Paris). 1986; 68: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Jacobi A. Rossmann R. Böck A. Arch.

The same mutations also reduce efficiency of urease maturation in Helicobacter pylori showing the more general importance of the two proteins (9Olson J.W. Mehta N.S. Maier R.J. Mol.

Because of its nickel binding capacity and its ability to form a dimeric complex with HypB, HypA is expected to be a nickel chelator rather than the deliverer to the hydrogenase active site. Instead, this central function is attributed to HypB, a G-nucleotide-binding protein, whose GTPase activity is reportedly essential for nickel insertion into hydrogenases (12Maier T. Lottspeich F. Böck A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As for most other small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis reaction is very slow (kcat = 0.17 min-1 and KM = 4 μm for HypB from Escherichia coli) (13Maier T. Jacobi A. Sauter M. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 630-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and no accelerating factor has been described so far. Based on metal-binding properties, HypB proteins can be divided into three different subgroups. The first group exhibits a mostly N-terminal polyhistidine stretch in addition to the G-domain. In Bradyrhizobium japonicum this stretch is capable of binding 16 nickel ions per dimer with a KD of 2.3 μm (14Fu C. Olson J.W. Maier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Deletion of the histidine-rich region results in a truncated protein that nevertheless is able to bind one nickel ion per monomer and still functions in mobilizing nickel in vivo (15Olson J.W. Fu C. Maier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Olson J.W. Maier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The second group, including HypB from E. coli, also shows an extended N-terminal region but contains no polyhistidine sequence. A study of metal-binding properties of HypB from E. coli showed that this protein binds two nickel ions per monomer. The first ion is bound by the conserved N-terminal CXX- CGC sequence with sub-picomolar affinity and high specificity, whereas the second metal-binding site, located in the G-domain (including residues Cys-166, His-167, and Cys-198), has lower specificity for nickel over zinc and a lower metal affinity (17Leach M.R. Sandal S. Sun H. Zamble D.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12229-12238Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The affinity of this site for zinc was determined to 1 μm and 10 times higher for nickel. In vivo mutational studies of this metal-binding site show that replacement of any of these residues to alanine completely blocks hydrogenase maturation in vivo (18Böck A. King P.W. Blokesch M. Posewitz M.C. Adv. Microbiol. 2006; 51 (in press)Google Scholar). The third HypB subgroup, mainly composed of HypB proteins from thermophilic organisms, lacks the N-terminal nickel-binding part and shows only a short stretch of 20 amino acids prior to the G-domain. In order to gain insight into the mode of action of HypB and to understand the relation between nickel incorporation and GTP binding/hydrolysis, we solved the crystal structure of HypB from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (HypB subgroup 3), which is a short version of the protein family and thus should represent the essential features of HypB function. Plasmid Constructs—The encoding DNA fragment of HypB from M. jannaschii was amplified by genomic PCR and cloned into the pGex 4T3 plasmid using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. The construct for expression of HypBΔN (residues 72-290) from E. coli was amplified by PCR using the pGex4T3-plasmid containing HypB (full length) as template and cloned into a modified pGex4T1 plasmid (EcoRI and XhoI) containing a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. HypBΔN(L242A,L246A) was generated using the Stratagene Quikchange protocol. Protein Expression and Purification—HypB from M. jannaschii was expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in E. coli strain Rosetta DE3. HypBΔN and HypBΔN(L242A,L246A) from E. coli were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in E. coli strain BL21DE3. The following protocol serves for all purified proteins. At A600 of 0.6 in TB-medium expression was induced by addition of 100 μm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, and cells were harvested after 4 h of incubation at 37 °C by centrifugation. The cells were lysed in standard buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) 2The abbreviations used are: β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate; ICPMS, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Se-Met, selenomethionine; SIMIBI, after signal recognition particle, MinD and BioD; TRAFAC, after translation factors; SRP, the signal recognition particle; SR, serum receptor; TXRF, total x-ray reflection fluorescence; PDB, Protein Data Bank; r.m.s.d, root mean square deviation; mol, molecule.) containing 0.15 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride using a microfluidizer. Cell lysate supernatant was applied to a GSH column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with standard buffer at 4 °C. Unspecifically bound protein was removed by washing with high salt buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 5 mm β-ME). Fusion protein was cleaved with 400 units of thrombin (bovine; Serva) or 0.5 mg of tobacco etch virus protease in protease buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-ME) on the column. After elution, HypB from M. jannaschii was incubated with 0.5 units/(mg of protein) alkaline phosphatase (bovine; Roche Diagnostics) in standard buffer containing 1 mm ZnCl2 and 200 mm (NH4)2SO4 to remove bound nucleotide. HypBΔN from E. coli was incubated with 0.5 units/(mg of protein) alkaline phosphatase in standard buffer only, because precipitation was observed in the presence of ZnCl2 or (NH4)2SO4. After 20 h the proteins were further purified by gel filtration on Superdex S-75 (Amersham Biosciences) with standard buffer to remove unbound nucleotide. Purified protein was concentrated to a final concentration between 40 and 70 mg/ml, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Overexpression of HypB from M. jannaschii for selenomethionine incorporation was performed in minimal medium containing 50 mg/liter selenomethionine. Purification was analogous to the purification of native HypB except for using 10 mm β-ME. Crystallography—Crystals of M. jannaschii HypB were obtained using the hanging drop/vapor diffusion method. 2 μl of 20 mg/ml protein solution containing 3 mm GTPγS were mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution (native: 150 mm maleic acid disodium salt, 42.5 mm HCl, 20% PEG3350; Se-Met: 175 mm maleic acid disodium salt, 52.5 mm HCl, 14% PEG3350). Crystals grew after 1-2 days to a dimension of 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.05 mm. For data collection, crystals were cryoprotected in a buffer containing 217.5 mm maleic acid disodium salt, 61.6 mm HCl, 31.9% PEG3350, 14.5% xylitol, 14.5% sucrose, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 mm β-ME. Native and Se-Met data sets were collected in Grenoble at ID14-1 and at SLS (X10SA), respectively. Data were processed with XDS (19Kabsch W. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3218) Google Scholar), and initial heavy atom sites for SAD phasing were identified with SHELXD (20Usón I. Sheldrick G.M Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Refinement of the initial sites and search for additional sites were performed using SOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). Phase determination, density modification, and automated model building with SOLVE/RESOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar, 23Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 59: 34-44PubMed Google Scholar) led to an interpretable density map and an initial model. The atomic model was further built using COOT (24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23040) Google Scholar), and refinement was carried out with Refmac5 (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The native model was obtained, using MOLREP (26Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4138) Google Scholar) and Refmac5. Because Se-Met crystals showed higher resolution, they were used for determination of anomalous signals of zinc and nickel. Data sets were collected at wavelengths of 1.488 and 1.281 Å for nickel and zinc, respectively. Anomalous maps were generated using MOLREP to obtain initial phases and CAD and FFT (CCP4-package) to calculate electron density. The occupancies of metal ions have been defined by adjusting the occupancies such that the B-factors approximate the mean B-factor of the surrounding atoms. Additionally, the occupancies were determined by alternate refinement of occupancies and B-factors with MLPHARE (CCP4 package). Overlays of structural models were performed using COOT or BRAGI (27Schomburg D. Reichelt J. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 161-165Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). All figures were created using Pymol (DeLano Scientific). Size Exclusion Chromatography—All analytical gel filtration experiments were performed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-ME. 300 μm protein was incubated with 300 μm GDP or GTPγS prior to application onto the Superdex 75 10/30 column. The column was pre-equilibrated with 500 μm GDP or 500 μm GTP in standard buffer. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Binding affinity of GDP or GTPγS to HypB was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. The binding energy upon titration of nucleotide (400 μm) to HypB (40 μm) was measured at 20 °C in standard buffer. All experiments were at least performed twice. The data obtained were fitted using the MicroCal-ITC implementation of ORIGIN 7. ICPMS and TXRF—For determination of bound metal ions, Se-Met-containing protein was used. Samples were dialyzed against buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm β-ME to reduce the salt concentration. ICPMS and TXRF were performed at the Institute for Analytical Sciences, Dortmund, Germany. Overall Structure—The crystal structure of HypB from M. jannaschii in the GTPγS-bound state was solved to 1.9 Å resolution (Table 1). The final refined structural model contains two HypB molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, consisting of 211 (mol A) and 209 (mol B) residues. At the N terminus, electron density for the first 10 amino acids of the 24.3-kDa polypeptide is not defined, because electrospray ionization-mass spectra show the presence of full-length HypB.TABLE 1Crystallographic data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionNative data setData sets for anomalous signalsSe-MetZincNickelSpace groupP212121P212121P212121P212121Cell dimensionsa, b, and c (Å)43.46, 68.11, 155.8443.12, 68.02, 156.0843.12, 68.02, 156.0843.19, 68.10, 156.50Wavelength (Å)0.97580.97851.2811.488Resolution, (Å)20.0-1.90 (2.0-1.9)20.0-2.10 (2.2-2.1)20-2.6 (2.8-2.6)20-2.4 (2.6-2.4)Rsym (%)6.2 (23.3)4.8 (8.4)4.8 (8.0)8.8 (29.8)I/σ(I)21.9 (7.9)20.5 (9.1)18.6 (13.2)10.1 (4.2)Completeness (%)99.6 (99.3)99.1 (94.4)99.4 (99.9)98.4 (97.4)No. of reflections observed242,599 (33,238)194,893 (13,225)aFriedel pairs are treated as different reflections.80,948 (15,945)aFriedel pairs are treated as different reflections.109,523 (22,753)aFriedel pairs are treated as different reflections.No. of reflections unique37,224 (5182)51,861 (6809)aFriedel pairs are treated as different reflections.27,106 (5419)aFriedel pairs are treated as different reflections.34,310 (7221)aFriedel pairs are treated as different reflections.PhasingSe sites12FOM after SOLVE0.38FOM after RESOLVE (centric/acentric)0.62/0.74RefinementRwork/Rfree (%)22.0/24.120.0/24.2No. of atomsProtein32453245GTPγS6464Magnesium22Zinc0.5 + 0.50.5 + 0.5 + 2Water174128r.m.s.d.Bond lengths (Å) (weight)0.007 (0.022)0.008 (0.022)Bond angles (°) (weight)1.105 (2.011)1.089 (2.011)a Friedel pairs are treated as different reflections. Open table in a new tab The overall structure of each monomer is globular, with dimensions of (40 Å)3, whereas the dimer has a more elongated shape (Fig. 1A). Dimer formation involves a buried surface of 2527 Å2. Each polypeptide consists of a seven-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked on both sides by 11 α-helices. By that, the outermost β-strand is β7, and β1 is found in the center of the β-sheet flanked by β5 and β4. Beginning with the extra long N-terminal helix α1, there is a strictly alternating pattern of β-strands and α-helices (Fig. 2B). The topology of HypB is different from that of Ras and other Ras-like proteins in the N-terminal part. The most prominent difference is the extra number of helices and the absence of the antiparallel β-strand β2inRas (Fig. 2B). By sequence comparison HypB was categorized as belonging to the SIMIBI class of GTP-binding proteins (28Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar), which exhibit a different topology as compared with the TRAFAC class. Although members of the TRAFAC class feature a six-stranded β-sheet containing one antiparallel strand, with an occasional nucleotide state-dependent extra (parallel) strand (29Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar), SIMIBI G-proteins exhibit a seven-stranded parallel β-sheet. The structural analysis of HypB fully supports this classification, which puts HypB into a close structural and functional (see below) neighborhood to the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor (SR).FIGURE 2A, sequence alignment of HypB proteins. The alignment was performed using all known HypB proteins (only six of which are shown), and residue numbers correspond to M. jannaschii HypB. Highly conserved G-nucleotide-binding motifs are indicated. The secondary structure motifs are shown as green arrows for β-strands and red boxes for α-helices. All amino acids contributing to dimerization are marked with blue bars. Amino acids involved in metal binding are marked with black and white arrows. Residues Leu-242 and Leu-246 of E. coli, mutated in dimerization-deficient protein, are marked with a blue asterisk. B, topology diagrams of HypB and Ras. Strands are shown as green arrows, and helices as red bars. The P-loop is shown as a blue line; the black arrow marks the N terminus of the structural models. C, magnesium coordination of Ras (PDB code 121P).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Calculations of the electrostatic surface of HypB using the adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann equation show that the protein surface is mainly negatively charged with a remarkable exception of helix α1 (Fig. 1B). This amphipathic helix has all positively charged amino acids located on the accessible surface. This pattern of positively charged residues prior to the G-domain is highly conserved in HypB proteins, indicating that it might be involved in interacting with as yet to be identified partner proteins or other negatively charged molecules. One GTPγS nucleotide is bound to each monomer (Fig. 1A). The affinity of HypB from M. jannaschii toward GDP and GTPγS was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (Fig. 1C) and for HypBΔN from E. coli (data not shown). The dissociation constants for guanosine di- and triphosphate are in the micromolar range, with 3.4 μm for GTPγS and 0.89 μm for GDP for HypB from M. jannaschii, and 2.02 and 2.2 μm, respectively, for HypBΔN from E. coli. These affinities are much lower than those found for most Ras proteins, consistent with observations for other SIMIBI class G-proteins, indicating that this type of proteins can in principle freely exchange nucleotide without the help of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Active Site- and Nucleotide-dependent Dimerization—The overall structure shows that two GTPγS molecules are tightly sandwiched in the dimer interface, in a parallel orientation. Because the nucleotide-binding sites are formed by both monomers, they appear to mediate dimer formation (Fig. 3, A and B). Binding from monomer A involves two of the consensus motifs of the superfamily: the P-loop (GXXXXGK(S/T)), which wraps around the β,γ-phosphates, and the NKXD motif that is involved in the guanine-specific recognition of the base. The P-loop Lys-46 contacts the β,γ-phosphate oxygens, and the Thr-47 side chain is a ligand of Mg2+. Almost all GTP-binding proteins of the SIMIBI and TRAFAC classes contain the canonical DXXG sequence followed by the catalytically important glutamine in most TRAFAC class G-proteins (28Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). HypB has an EXXG motif, also found in BioD-related proteins, which is part of the totally invariant ENXGNLXCP motif connecting switch II with zinc binding (see below). Glu-120 is a direct ligand of Mg2+, rather than a water-mediated one formed by Asp from DXXG. There is another direct ionic interaction with Asp-75 from helix α3. The magnesium coordination sphere of HypB is complemented by Thr-47 from the P-loop, the β,γ-phosphate oxygens, and a water-mediated contact to the α-phosphate, very similar to what has been described for BioD (30Huang W. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Gibson K.J. Flint D. Lorimer G. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 407-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This is different from the coordination sphere of Ras and Ras-like proteins, which possess only two direct ionic interactions coming from two phosphate oxygens, two hydroxyl side chains, and two water molecules as ligands (Fig. 2C). It is also different from the SIMIBI protein SRP, where Mg2+ is liganded by two phosphate oxygens, one threonine side chain (from P-loop), and three water molecules. The conserved glycine is close to the γ-phosphate and could potentially form a similar main chain hydrogen bond as the glycine from the DXXG motif. The α-phosphate is contacted by the guanidino group of a highly conserved Arg-78 not found in other SIMIBI and TRAFAC NTPases. A similar positioned arginine in SMC ATPases (ABC cassette) is essential for ATP hydrolysis (31Lammens A. Schele A. Hopfner K.P. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 12229-12238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Monomer B contributes to the binding of the base, the ribose, and the γ-phosphate with participating residues that are highly conserved (Fig. 3B). The guanine base is bound by the carbonyl group of Ala-174 of monomer B (helix α9). The lysine from the NKXD motif is stabilized by the main chain of Thr-145 (mol B), and the ribose is bound by the main chain of Val-175 and a water-mediated contact of Asp-148 from the other monomer. The Active Site—Both monomers contribute to the active site around the γ-phosphate and shield it from solvent. Apart from the canonical interaction with the P-loop and the magnesium ion (mol A), the γ-phosphate is additionally fixed by Asp-75 (mol A), and a water-mediated contact to Thr-150 (mol B). Monomer B also supplies an invariant lysine (Lys-153), which directly contacts the γ-phosphate and is itself bound by two water molecules, one of which is a ligand to Mg2+. Judging from the number of interactions, monomer B via Lys-153 is crucial for stabilizing the active site elements around the γ-phosphate. As is commonly found in GTP-binding proteins, there is a water molecule in a position opposite to the scissile Pβ-O-Pγ bond (3.6 Å) to act as nucleophile, and it is contacted by His-154 (mol B) and the invariant Asp-69 (mol A). Asp-69 in the second β-strand is highly conserved in all SIMIBI family proteins and is proposed to act as general base in nucleophile activation in the SRP-SR GTPase (32Egea P.F. Shan S. Napetschnig J. Savage D.F. Walter P. Stroud R. Nature. 2004; 427: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the Fe protein of nitrogenase (33Lanzilotta W.N. Fisher N. Seefeldt L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4157-4165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the DNA-binding protein Soj ATPase (homologue of ParA) (34Leonard T.A. Butler P.J. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) reactions. To investigate the oligomeric state of HypB in solution, we performed size exclusion chromatography with HypB from M. jannaschii and HypBΔN from E. coli in the presence of GDP, GTP, or in nucleotide-free buffer (Fig. 3C). The results indicate that HypBΔN from E. coli is a monomer in the absence of any nucleotide. In the presence of GTP this protein eluted with lower retention time, suggesting a higher molecular mass, most likely because of dimerization. In GDP-containing buffer HypBΔN elutes at a volume between monomer and dimer indicative of a fast equilibrium between the two states. Mutation of residues Leu-242 and Leu-246 to Ala, which contribute to dimerization in a hydrophobic patch (Fig. 3A, blue area), completely abolishes nucleotide-dependent dimerization (Fig. 3C, dashed lines). HypB from M. jannaschii eluted independent of the nucleotide state as one species at retention times similar to those of GDP-bound HypBΔN from E. coli. We thus assume that under the conditions used, HypB from M. jannaschii is in a fast monomer/dimer equilibrium. Metal Binding Properties—HypB is essential for nickel incorporation into hydrogenases. A recent determination of metal-binding properties of HypB showed that the E. coli protein harbors two metal-binding sites, one located at the N-terminal CXXCGC motif and a second site in the G-domain, including residues Cys-166, His-167, and Cys-198 (17Leach M.R. Sandal S. Sun H. Zamble D.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12229-12238Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Böck A. King P.W. Blokesch M. Posewitz M.C. Adv. Microbiol. 2006; 51 (in press)Google Scholar). HypB from M. jannaschii lacks the N-terminal sequences and thus the N-terminal nickel-binding site. Sequence alignments show that the second nickel- or zinc (as an analogue of nickel)-binding site, located in the G-domain is completely conserved among members of the HypB family (Fig. 2A, black arrows). Examination of the electron density map revealed two putative metal-binding sites per monomer. The first site consisting of His-100 and His-104 is exposed to solvent and points away from the dimer interface (Fig. 4A, blue). The second site includes residues Cys-95, His-96, and Cys-127, which coincide with the predicted metal-binding site of HypB from E. coli. These residues are located directly in the dimerization interface (Fig. 4A, brown). For a more direct determination of the binding site, anomalous data sets for nickel at 1.488 Å and zinc at 1.281 Å were collected. The Se-Met crystals already contained zinc, which remained bound to the protein during purification, and were not further soaked with zinc. Crystals for the nickel anomalous data set were soaked in 25 mm NiCl2. A high signal (35 σ) for zinc was found at the first site consisting of His-100 and His-104 (Fig. 4B, ZnC). Here the tetragonal coordination of zinc is completed by the same residues of a second HypB molecule of the adjacent asymmetric unit in the crystal. Free in solution, HypB is dimeric at most, and thus the zinc ion binding would, if it also exists in solution, be complemented by two water molecules. His-100 and -104 are not conserved over all HypB proteins (Fig. 2A, white arrows), indicating that nickel binding at this site is eventually not involved in the nickel delivery function of HypB. If this site is not a crystal packing artifact, its most probable function is nickel storage because of the fact that ba"
https://openalex.org/W2038812640,"We seeded tissue engineered human skin substitutes with endothelial cells (EC) differentiated in vitro from progenitors from umbilical cord blood (CB-EC) or adult peripheral blood (AB-EC), comparing the results to previous work using cultured human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) with or without Bcl-2 transduction. Vascularized skin substitutes were prepared by seeding Bcl-2-transduced or nontransduced HUVEC, CB-EC, or AB-EC on the deep surface of decellularized human dermis following keratinocyte coverage of the epidermal surface. These skin substitutes were transplanted onto C.B-17 SCID/beige mice receiving systemic rapamycin or vehicle control and were analyzed 21 d later. CB-EC and Bcl-2-HUVEC formed more human EC-lined vessels than AB-EC or control HUVEC; CB-EC, Bcl-2-HUVEC, and AB-EC but not control HUVEC promoted ingrowth of mouse EC-lined vessels. Bcl-2 transduction increased the number of human and mouse EC-lined vessels in grafts seeded with HUVEC but not with CB-EC or AB-EC. Both CB-EC and AB-EC-induced microvessels became invested by smooth muscle cell-specific alpha-actin-positive mural cells, indicative of maturation. Rapamycin inhibited ingrowth of mouse EC-lined vessels but did not inhibit formation of human EC-lined vessels. We conclude that EC differentiated from circulating progenitors can be utilized to vascularize human skin substitutes even in the setting of compromised host angiogenesis/vasculogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2075873641,"The clock gene period-4 (prd-4) in Neurospora was identified by a single allele displaying shortened circadian period and altered temperature compensation. Positional cloning followed by functional tests show that PRD-4 is an ortholog of mammalian checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2). Expression of prd-4 is regulated by the circadian clock and, reciprocally, PRD-4 physically interacts with the clock component FRQ, promoting its phosphorylation. DNA-damaging agents can reset the clock in a manner that depends on time of day, and this resetting is dependent on PRD-4. Thus, prd-4, the Neurospora Chk2, identifies a molecular link that feeds back conditionally from circadian output to input and the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2019861100,"The TRPV ion channels mediate responses to many sensory stimuli including heat, low pH, neuropeptides, and chemical ligands. All TRPV subfamily members contain an intracellular N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD), a prevalent protein interaction motif. The 1.6-Å crystal structure of the TRPV2-ARD, with six ankyrin repeats, reveals several atypical structural features. Repeats one through three display unusually long and flexible fingers with a large number of exposed aromatic residues, whereas repeats five and six have unusually long outer helices. Furthermore, a large counterclockwise twist observed in the stacking of repeats four and five breaks the regularity of the domain, altering the shape of surfaces available for interactions with proteins or other cellular ligands. Both solution studies and crystal packing interactions indicate that the TRPV2-ARD does not form homo-oligomers, suggesting that the ARD of TRPV ion channels may be used for interactions with regulatory factors rather than in promoting tetrameric assembly of the ion channels. The TRPV ion channels mediate responses to many sensory stimuli including heat, low pH, neuropeptides, and chemical ligands. All TRPV subfamily members contain an intracellular N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD), a prevalent protein interaction motif. The 1.6-Å crystal structure of the TRPV2-ARD, with six ankyrin repeats, reveals several atypical structural features. Repeats one through three display unusually long and flexible fingers with a large number of exposed aromatic residues, whereas repeats five and six have unusually long outer helices. Furthermore, a large counterclockwise twist observed in the stacking of repeats four and five breaks the regularity of the domain, altering the shape of surfaces available for interactions with proteins or other cellular ligands. Both solution studies and crystal packing interactions indicate that the TRPV2-ARD does not form homo-oligomers, suggesting that the ARD of TRPV ion channels may be used for interactions with regulatory factors rather than in promoting tetrameric assembly of the ion channels.

Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). TRP channels, like many voltage- and ligand-gated channels, have six membrane-spanning segments and are thought to function as tetramers. TRP channels also have large N- and C-terminal cytosolic regions containing putative protein interaction and regulatory motifs. The TRP channel family is divided into six subfamilies based on sequence identity and function, including the TRPV subfamily (named after the vanilloid receptor, TRPV1); there is little homology in the N- and C-terminal cytosolic regions between subfamilies. The six mammalian TRPV channels are important in sensory and pain perception and in calcium homeostasis. At the molecular level, TRPV1 and TRPV2 are both activated at noxious temperatures (>43 °C and >52 °C, respectively) (2Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D.

The more distant TRPV homologs TRPV5 and TRPV6 are regulated by intracellular Ca2+ levels and mediate trans-epithelial Ca2+ transport in the kidney and intestine (11Nijenhuis T. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Pfluegers. Arch. 2005; 451: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of TRPV channels contains ankyrin repeats, which are likely to be essential for channel function as their deletion in TRPV1 impairs activation (12Jung J. Lee S.Y. Hwang S.W.

Furthermore, the TRPV5 and TRPV6 ankyrin repeats were implicated in the tetrameric assembly of the channels (13Chang Q. Gyftogianni E. van de Graaf S.F. Hoefs S. Weidema F.A. Bindels R.J.

Ankyrin repeats are 33-residue sequence motifs often involved in protein-protein interactions and present in many eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins with functions that include signaling, cytoskeleton integrity, transcription, and cellular localization (15Mosavi L.K.

Determining the three-dimensional structures of TRPV channel domains is an important step in understanding the molecular basis of gating and regulatory mechanisms. We report the structure of N-terminal cytosolic ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of the TRPV2 ion channel. The TRPV2-ARD is monomeric in solution and its three-dimensional structure consist of six ankyrin repeat structural motifs, of which only four could be identified by sequence motif searches. Comparison with other ankyrin repeat structures highlights several unusual structural features of the TRPV2-ARD. The structure provides a context for data on the functional roles of the N-terminal regions in TRPV ion channel physiology. Cloning and Protein Expression—The TRPV2-ARD coding sequence (two constructs, residues 62–326 and 75–321) was amplified from the rat TRPV2 cDNA (provided by Michael Caterina) and inserted into the NdeI and NotI sites of pET21-C6H. pET21-C6H was generated by ligating a short double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-TCGACACTAGTGACGTCGCGGCCGCTCATCATCACCATCATCATTGA-3′ and 5′-GGCCTCAATGATGATGGTGATGATGAGCGGCCGCGACGTCACTAGTG-3′) in the SalI and NotI sites of pET21a (Novagen). The resulting coding sequences include a C-terminal AAAHHHHHH-tag. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) in LB medium and induced at A600 = 0.5 with 75 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at room temperature for 8–16 h. Selenomethionine (Se-Met)-substituted protein was expressed with feedback inhibition of methionine synthesis in BL21(DE3) grown in fully supplemented M9 minimal medium with Se-Met. Purification of TRPV2-ARD—Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Triton X-100) with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme and lysed by sonication. The cleared lysate was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), washed, and eluted using a step gradient (60, 100, and 250 mm imidazole). Fractions containing TRPV2-ARD were pooled, concentrated, and loaded on a Superdex 200 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm DTT. Fractions containing TRPV2-ARD were pooled, diluted to 75 mm NaCl, loaded on a Resource-Q column (GE Healthcare), and eluted using a linear NaCl gradient. Pure fractions of TRPV2-ARD (75–321) were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and concentrated to ∼5 mg/ml and TRPV2-ARD (62–326) dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT and concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml. Typical yield was 5–10 mg/liter of culture. Protein samples were judged adequate if >95% pure on Commassie-stained gels. Near 100% Se-Met incorporation was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Size Exclusion Chromatography and Light Scattering—Size exclusion analyses were performed using a Superdex 200 10/30 column (GE Healthcare), loading 100–500 μl of protein at concentrations ranging from 100 to 350 μm in the corresponding storage buffer. Size exclusion chromatography-multi-angle laser light scattering measurements were performed on the Superdex 200 10/30 column coupled to DAWN multi-angle light scattering and Optilab differential refractive index detectors (Wyatt Technologies). Data acquisition and analysis were performed using ASTRA 4.0 software (Wyatt Technologies). Crystallization of TRPV2-ARD—Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion with a 1:1 ratio of protein and reservoir solution in each drop. Crystal form I (native and Se-Met-substituted) grew at room temperature from 1.2 m lithium acetate, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5. Crystal form II grew at 4 °C from 1.2 m lithium acetate, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0. Crystal form III (62–326) grew at 4 °C from 9% PEG-8000, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.0, 5–7% xylitol. All crystals were flash-frozen after cryo-protection with 20% glycerol in the corresponding reservoir solution. Data Collection and Structure Determination—X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K. Native and Se-Met derivative data of TRPV2-ARD crystal form I were collected at the Advanced Photon Source Structural Biology Center ID-19 beamline with the SBC CCD2 detector and data on TRPV2-ARD crystal form III were collected at the Advanced Photon Source BM8 beamline using an ADSC Q315 CCD detector. Both were processed with HKL2000 (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38241) Google Scholar). Data on TRPV2-ARD crystal form II were collected on a MicroMax007 x-ray generator equipped with an R-AXIS IV++ detector and processed with CrystalClear (Rigaku/MSC Inc.). The TRPV2-ARD structure (crystal form I; 2.2 Å resolution) was determined using Se-Met single-wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing with SOLVE (18Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar) and DM (19Cowtan K. Main P. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The TRPV2-ARD crystal form II (to 1.6 Å) and III (to 3.1 Å) structures were determined by molecular replacement with the TRPV2-ARD crystal form I structure as a search model using MOLREP (20Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Structures were refined with TLS in REFMAC (21Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13708) Google Scholar). Data, phasing, and refinement statistics are provided in supplemental Table 1. Domain Boundary Determination—We identified the ARD boundaries of TRPV2 using sequence alignments, a sequence motif search algorithm (SMART (22Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar)) and secondary structure predictions ([email protected] (23Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar)). Additional pairs of α-helices are predicted to precede and link the ankyrin repeat sequence motifs. We therefore postulated that the ARD extended further toward the N terminus, from residues 75 to 321 (Fig. 1A). A similar prediction was recently published for TRPV6 (14Erler I. Hirnet D. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Niemeyer B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34456-34463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This N-terminal boundary coincides with the beginning of the high sequence identity region within the TRPV subfamily. Hence, a TRPV2-ARD protein construct spanning residues 75–321 was expressed in E. coli and purified (Fig. 1B). Solution Characterization of Oligomeric State—TRPV proteins are tetrameric ion channels (24Hoenderop J.G. Voets T. Hoefs S. Weidema F. Prenen J. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 25Kedei N. Szabo T. Lile J.D. Treanor J.J. Olah Z. Iadarola M.J. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and the ankyrin repeats of TRPV5 and TRPV6 have been shown to be important for channel tetramerization (13Chang Q. Gyftogianni E. van de Graaf S.F. Hoefs S. Weidema F.A. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54304-54311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Erler I. Hirnet D. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Niemeyer B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34456-34463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the oligomeric state of the isolated TRPV2-ARD. Both size exclusion chromatography and multi-angle laser light scattering (26Wyatt P. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1265) Google Scholar) indicate that the TRPV2-ARD is monodisperse and monomeric in solution at protein concentrations up to 350μm (size exclusion chromatography apparent molecular mass of 29 kDa and light scattering molecular mass of 27.3 kDa, versus calculated molecular mass = 28 628 Da for construct 75–321; Fig. 1B and data not shown). Overall Structure of TRPV2-ARD—We determined the structure of the TRPV2-ARD in three crystal forms (supplemental Table 1), and except where noted, the 1.6-Å TRPV2-ARD structure from crystal form II was used for analyses (Fig. 1C). The structure comprises six structural repeats consisting of a pair of anti-parallel α-helices with an intervening “finger” loop. All six repeats therefore resemble the ankyrin repeat structural motif, with two short anti-parallel helices followed by a finger loop projecting outward from the helical axes at a ∼90° angle, resulting in a characteristic L-shaped cross-section. The helical hairpins stack together such that the inner helices and fingers form a concave surface. This assembled structure has been likened to a cupped hand: the loops form the fingers, hence the name, and the exposed surface of the inner helices forms the palm. This concave palm surface is often a site of protein-protein interactions in other ankyrin repeat proteins (15Mosavi L.K. Cammett T.J. Desrosiers D.C. Peng Z.Y. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 16Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Conformational Differences of TRPV2-ARD in Three Different Crystal Forms—Within the three crystal forms of the TRPV2-ARD, five independent observations of the structure are available for comparison. The overall structures are similar, with pairwise root mean squared deviation values ranging from 0.31 to 2.0 Å for all Cα atoms, although several local conformational differences were observed. The most different conformations are superimposed in Fig. 1D, displaying marked differences within the long fingers 1–3 and the N terminus of outer helix 5, indicating additional flexibility afforded by this unusually long helix. The flexibility suggested by this conformational variability supports the idea that these three fingers may play important roles in interacting with other proteins. A number of bulky aromatic residues, Phe161, Tyr162, Phe198, Phe199, Phe207, Tyr208, and Phe209, are located on the concave face of fingers 2 and 3 (Fig. 1E). This extended patch of solvent-exposed aromatic residues forms a potential hydrophobic interacting surface. Comparison with Other Ankyrin Repeat Structures—A comparison of the TRPV2-ARD structure with canonical ankyrin repeats reveals that, although several consensus ankyrin repeat residues are highly conserved in the six repeats (Fig. 2A), the TRPV2-ARD has several unusual structural features. In a typical ankyrin repeat structure, such as that of the 12 C-terminal repeats of ankyrin, the repeats stack very regularly, with only a slight counterclockwise twist of ∼2–3° along the stacking axis (27Michaely P. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In contrast, the overall structure of the TRPV2-ARD can be seen as two adjacent stacks of repeats. Repeats 1–4 stack with an average twist of ∼2°, similar to ankyrin, but a large twist of ∼21° between repeats 4 and 5 leads to a distortion of the concave palm-finger surface often used for protein-protein interactions by ankyrin repeat-containing proteins (Fig. 2B). The length of the repeats is quite variable and generally longer than the 33 residues of canonical ankyrin repeats, 43, 47, 45, 36, 49, and 33 residues, respectively, in TRPV2 (note that the last repeat does not have an associated finger; Fig. 2A). Insertions within ankyrin repeat domains have been previously observed in other structures and are most often found in the finger region, although other insertion locations have also been observed (15Mosavi L.K. Cammett T.J. Desrosiers D.C. Peng Z.Y. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 16Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In TRPV2-ARD, insertions are found not only in fingers 1–3 but also in outer helices 5 and 6. Although the lengths of the inner helices are typical of a canonical ankyrin repeat, 7 residues on average (15Mosavi L.K. Cammett T.J. Desrosiers D.C. Peng Z.Y. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), outer helices 5 and 6 are significantly longer than the 9-residue average for ankyrin repeats (15Mosavi L.K. Cammett T.J. Desrosiers D.C. Peng Z.Y. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), with outer helix 5 exceptionally long at 21 residues (Fig. 2). Another atypical feature of TRPV2-ARD is that the fingers vary greatly in length and conformation and none of the five fingers have the β-hairpin hydrogen bonding pattern often seen in other ankyrin repeat proteins (27Michaely P. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). While the C-terminal fingers 4 and 5 are short and similar in size and shape to fingers of canonical ankyrin repeats, fingers 1–3 form long extended loops. In addition, finger 3 folds over on top of inner helices 3 and 4, thus creating a bulge in the concave surface of the domain. Sequence Conservation and Implications for Other TRPV Ion Channels—The aligned sequences of all six mammalian TRPV ion channels show a high level of similarity within the ARD (Fig. 3A). In fact, the N-terminal boundary of the ARD (residue ∼70 in TRPV2) also represents a boundary within the sequence alignment marking the beginning of the region of highest sequence similarity. We therefore believe that the six-repeat ARD will be conserved throughout the TRPV subfamily and that the domain boundaries identified in this study encompass the entire ARD of TRPV channels. TRPV5 and TRPV6 are more distantly related to the TRPV1–4 subgroup, and this divergence is reflected in the ARD, where many of the putative finger loops are shorter in TRPV5–6 than in TRPV1–4 (Fig. 3). Fig. 3B shows the distribution of conserved and variable residues within the TRPV family on the TRPV2-ARD structure. Conservation of sequence in the inner helices and the hydrophobic core of the palm supports our proposal that all TRPV channels have a six-repeat ARD. Also, the aromatic residues on the surface of fingers 2 and 3 are well conserved, particularly within the TRPV1–4 channels (Fig. 3). In contrast, the residues with the highest degree of sequence variability are located within the first ankyrin repeat, the solvent-exposed surface of the outer helices and the fingers of the ARD. The tip of finger 3, which seems very flexible according to our structural studies, also has particularly high sequence variability. Thus this finger is likely to adopt different conformations in the other TRPV channels and could be a major determinant of specificity in the regulatory interactions of TRPV channels. Implications for the Structure of Other TRPV Channels—Experimental evidence exists that repeat 1 of TRPV5 (residues 64–77) and repeat 3 of TRPV6 (residues 116–140) are important in tetrameric channel assembly (13Chang Q. Gyftogianni E. van de Graaf S.F. Hoefs S. Weidema F.A. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54304-54311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Erler I. Hirnet D. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Niemeyer B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34456-34463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although both our solution studies and the dissimilar packing interactions in different crystal forms indicate that TRPV2-ARD does not oligomerize, it is possible that the distantly related TRPV5- and TRPV6-ARDs tetramerize to promote channel assembly. Alternatively, the TRPV5- and TRPV6-ARD may interact with additional cellular factors to promote channel assembly. Another hypothesis is that these ARDs promote channel assembly by interacting with other regions within the TRPV5 and TRPV6 channels. Additional studies with the isolated TRPV5 and/or TRPV6-ARD could discriminate between these hypotheses. Implications for the Regulation of TRPV Channels—Functional and biochemical studies have implicated the N-terminal domain of TRPV channels in several regulatory mechanisms involving both phosphorylation events and the binding of regulatory proteins. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are common mechanisms by which ion channel function is regulated. Protein kinase A phosphorylates several residues within TRPV1, including Ser116 and Thr370, and thereby prevents desensitization of the channel (28Bhave G. Zhu W. Wang H. Brasier D.J. Oxford G.S. Gereau R.W. t. Neuron. 2002; 35: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 29Mohapatra D.P. Nau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13424-13432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and Src kinase phosphorylates Tyr200 in human TRPV1 (Tyr199 in rat (30Zhang X. Huang J. McNaughton P.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4211-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar)). Based on the TRPV2-ARD structure, TRPV1 S116 is predicted to be on inner helix 1 and Tyr199 on the concave face of finger 2, and either phosphorylation event could therefore regulate the binding of regulatory factors to the concave face of the TRPV1-ARD. Thr370 is just past the proposed C-terminal boundary of the TRPV1-ARD, likely in a linker region between the ARD and the following domain. Thus Thr370 phosphorylation could possibly regulate the spatial relationship of the two domains. A binding site for the SH3 domain of PACSIN3 was recently identified at residues 132–144 of TRPV4, which is a prolinerich region immediately preceding the predicted ARD (Fig. 3 (31Cuajungco M.P. Grimm C. Oshima K. D'Hoedt D. Nilius B. Mensenkamp A.R. Bindels R.J. Plomann M. Heller S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18753-18762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)). The TRPV1 N terminus, in particular residues 200–414, encompassing the last three ankyrin repeats and ∼50 additional residues preceding the channel domain, was found to associate with synaptotagmin IX and snapin, two components of SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein receptor)-dependent exocytosis in excitable cells (32Morenilla-Palao C. Planells-Cases R. Garcia-Sanz N. Ferrer-Montiel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25665-25672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid screens have also identified proteins that interact with the N terminus of TRPV2, including the recombinase gene activator and acyl-CoA binding domain protein 3 (ACBD3) (33Barnhill J.C.

The identification of the ARD boundaries can help design further mutagenesis or structural studies of the TRPV-ARD interactions with these identified ligands. The TRPV2-ARD structure reported here will therefore serve as a scaffold for future investigations of the molecular mechanisms regulating TRPV ion channels.

https://openalex.org/W2120259837,"This study was designed to examine whether NO regulates protein glutathiolation. Exposure to NO donors increased protein glutathiolation in COS-7 or rat aortic smooth muscle cells as detected by anti-protein glutathione (GSH) antibodies. This process was reversible and saturable. Stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh) increased protein glutathiolation in isolated rat aortic rings. This was prevented by inhibiting endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). In ACh-treated rings, proteins showing positive immunoreactivity with the anti-PSSG antibody (Ab) were identified by matrix assisted laser desorption-time-of-flight mass spectrometry to be actin, vimentin, and heat shock protein 70. Purified actin was more readily glutathiolated by S-nitrosoglutathione than by oxidized GSH as determined by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry, and nitrosylated actin was glutathiolated by reduced GSH. Relative to wild-type (WT) mice, increased protein glutathiolation was observed in hearts of mice with cardiac-specific expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Proteins immunoprecipitated from transgenic hearts revealed GSH-adducted peptides corresponding to adenine nucleotide translocator and the alpha-subunit of F1F0ATPase. These data suggest that exogenous NO or NO generated by eNOS or iNOS regulates protein adduction with GSH. This could be due to a direct reaction of proteins with S-nitrosoglutathione or denitrosylation of S-nitrosylated proteins by reduced GSH. Glutathiolation of cytoskeletal and mitochondrial proteins may be a significant feature of NO bioreactivity."

Progress usually reflects an interplay between theory, data, and tools. Six areas of innovation, principally data and tools, are now pushing at the frontiers of these sciences: longitudinal data, laboratory experimentation, improved statistical methods, geographic information tools, biosocial science, and international replication. These innovations are gaining power as they cross disciplinary boundaries, helping to attribute causality to observed relationships, to understand their nature, and thereby to improve the accuracy and usefulness of predictions."

Since PARP inhibitors sensitize tumor cells also to the methylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) and clinical trials are evaluating CPT-11 in combination with TMZ, we tested whether the PARP inhibitor GPI 15427 (10-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-2H-7-oxa-1,2-diaza-benzo[de]anthracen-3-one) increases the efficacy of CPT-11 + TMZ against colon cancer. Moreover, due to the ability of PARP inhibitors to avoid cell death consequent to PARP-1 overactivation, we evaluated whether oral administration of GPI 15427 provides protection from the dose-limiting intestinal toxicity of CPT-11. The results of colony formation assay indicated that GPI 15427 increased the antiproliferative effects (combination index <1) of TMZ + SN-38 (the active metabolite of CPT-11) against colon cancer cells. Accordingly, GPI 15427 (40 mg/kg/dayx5 days per os) in combination with TMZ (10 mg/kg/dayx5 days) + CPT-11 (4 mg/kg/dayx5 days) significantly reduced the growth of tumor xenografts. Oral administration of GPI 15427 (40 mg/kg/q2x3 days) prevented intestinal injury and diarrhea induced by CPT-11 (30 mg/kg/day x 3 days) reducing inflammation and PARP-1 overactivation, as evidenced by immunohistochemical staining of intestinal tissue with antipoly(ADP-ribose) antibody (Ab). In conclusion, the PARP inhibitor represents a novel strategy to enhance the antitumor efficacy and reduce toxicity of chemotherapy in colon cancer."

Such reform could be part of a more general redistribution of work. If a greater share of the population worked, then the average number of hours worked per week could be reduced. This could particularly help younger people and increase Europe's low birth rates. The challenges facing Germany, Europe's most populous country, are highlighted, but statistics are also given for five other European countries and, for comparison, the United States.

Interactions between HS and a variety of proteins, including growth factors and morphogens, are essential for embryonic development and for homeostasis in the adult.

The HS chains influence a multitude of processes in development and homeostasis, due to their ability to interact with a variety of proteins (1Bernfield M. Götte M. Park P.W. Reizes O.

Such interactions involve basic amino acid residues and are mediated by negatively charged carboxyl and sulfate groups along the HS chains. Biosynthesis of HS is initiated by the formation of a [4GlcAβ1-4GlcNAcα1]n precursor polysaccharide that is synthesized on a proteoglycan core protein. Subsequent enzymatic modification reactions involve partial replacement of N-acetyl by N-sulfate groups, C5-epimerization of GlcA to L-iduronic acid (IdoUA), and finally O-sulfation at various positions (reviewed in Ref. 4Esko J.D.

This notion applies to the family of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) that induce a variety of signaling events essential to development and homeostasis (for review, see Ref. 16Powers C.J. McLeskey S.W. Wellenstein A. Endocr.-Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). FGFs are polypeptides with a conserved core of ∼120 amino acid residues and more variable Nand C-terminal domains. The human FGF family consists of 22 species that are grouped in seven different subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis (for review, see Ref. 17Itoh N. Ornitz D.M.

The growth factors bind with variable selectivity to four different FGF receptors (FRs); in addition, FR1–3 present isoforms (b and c forms) due to alternative splicing of the IgIII domain in the extracellular ligand-binding part of the receptor. HS is required for binding of FGFs to their receptors (18Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 19Yayon A. Klagsbrun M.

We have used affinity chromatography based on immobilized FR ectodomains, soluble FGF1 or FGF2, and radiolabeled oligosaccharide libraries. The libraries were generated by chemo-enzymatic modification of size-defined, heparin-derived oligosaccharides and covered an extended sequence space. The results point to non-selective involvement of oligosaccharides in complexes between both growth factors and FR1c, FR2c, and FR3c, whereas FGF1 and FGF2 differ in their saccharide requirement for complex formation with FR4. Materials—Recombinant human FGF1 and FGF2 were produced in a bacterial expression system as described (32Zazo M. Lozano R.M. Ortega S. Varela J. Diza-Orejas R. Ramirez J.M. Gimenez-Gallego G.

Soluble FGF receptor-alkaline phosphatase (FR·AP) fusion proteins consisted of the three extracellular Ig-like loop domains of FR1, FR2, and FR3 (all IIIc splice variants) and the extracellular part of FR4 fused to the N terminus of human placental-AP (33Ornitz D.M.

Heparin from bovine lung was purified as described (34Lindahl U. Cifonelli J.A. Lindahl B. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2817-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HS from porcine intestinal mucosa was a kind gift by G. van Dedem (Diosynth, Oss, The Netherlands). HS from porcine liver was isolated as described (35Vanwildemeersch M. Olsson A.K. Gottfridsson E.

PD-10 desalting columns and DEAESephacel were from GE Healthcare Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). BioGel P-10 and empty 10-ml columns were purchased from Bio-Rad (Sundbyberg, Sweden), and a ProPac PA1 column was from Dionex (Surrey, UK). All other material was of best quality available. Preparation of Radiolabeled Oligosaccharides—Heparin and HS radiolabeled oligosaccharides were obtained as described (36Kreuger J. Prydz K. Pettersson R.F. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, heparin was subjected to partial deaminative cleavage with HNO2 (pH 1.5), and the products were reduced with NaB3H4 to obtain end-labeled oligosaccharides (specific activity ∼7.5 × 106 cpm/nmol). HS was isolated from tissues by a procedure involving proteolytic digestion followed by anionexchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel. N-Sulfated domains were excised from HS by N-deacetylation followed by deaminative cleavage (pH 3.9) and were then reduced with NaB3H4 and fractionated by sizing chromatography on a column (1 × 146 cm) of BioGel P-10. End-labeled oligosaccharides derived from liver and intestinal HS had specific radioactivities of ∼7.5 × 105 and ∼5.9 × 106 cpm/nmol, respectively. Oligosaccharide libraries with systematically varied O-sulfation patterns were generated as described (37Jemth P. Kreuger J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

Briefly, bovine lung heparin (see Fig. 1A) was 6-O-desulfated and partially 2-O-desulfated by treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide/methanol followed by re-N-sulfation. The product was partially depolymerized with HNO2 (pH 1.5) and reduced with NaB3H4 to obtain end-labeled oligosaccharides with a specific 3H activity of ∼7.5 × 106 cpm/nmol. Octaand decasaccharides recovered by sizing chromatography on BioGel P-10 were further separated by anion-exchange HPLC on a ProPac PA-1 column according to the number of 2-O-sulfate groups (i.e. 0–4 2-Osulfate groups in 8-mers, 0–5 in 10-mers). The ProPac PA-1 column was eluted with a linear gradient, total volume 150 ml, from 0 to 1.5 m NaCl in H2O adjusted to pH 3 with HCl, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions with a defined degree of 2-O-sulfation were subjected to enzymatic O-sulfation, almost exclusively in the 6-O-position (37Jemth P. Kreuger J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sturiale L.

Products were desalted on PD-10 columns and were analyzed, in some cases further fractionated, by anion-exchange HPLC (ProPac PA-1). Oligosaccharides devoid of 2-O-sulfate groups were obtained by partial deaminative cleavage of selectively 2-O-desulfated heparin (39Jaseja M. Rej R.N. Sauriol F. Perlin A.S. Can. J. Chem. 1989; 67: 1449-1457Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The products were reduced with NaB3H4, separated according to size, and recovered 10and 12-mer fractions were further fractionated with regard to 6-O-sulfation by anion-exchange HPLC on ProPac PA-1. Subfractions were pooled and desalted for subsequent affinity chromatography. Affinity Chromatography—FR·AP proteins were immobilized by incubating 50 pmol of each protein for 2 h at 4°C with 0.2 ml of anti-human placental AP-agarose beads equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl. The FR·AP suspension was transferred to 10-ml Bio-Rad columns (0.1 ml/column), washed with 100 volumes of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 2 m NaCl, and finally re-equilibrated with the initial buffer. 3H-radiolabeled oligosaccharides (2–20 × 103 cpm corresponding to 0.3–3 pmol), FGF (3–30 pmol of FGF1 or FGF2), or a combination of both (mixed just prior to application to the column), in 50 μl of equilibration buffer, were applied to the columns that were maintained for 30 min at 4 °C and subsequently eluted with a stepwise gradient ranging from 0.15 to 2 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Effluent fractions (0.2 ml) were collected and analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Control runs with labeled heparin oligosaccharides with and without FGFs on beads not substituted with FR·AP showed no binding under the conditions of the experiments. Heparin oligomers bound the FR1c–3c at very low ionic strength (i.e. 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4), as predicted by interaction data reported by others (40Powell A.K. Fernig D.G. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4724-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) but were completely eluted at 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl. Moreover, FGFs were applied to FR·AP columns in the absence of saccharides. Resultant effluent fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) followed by silver staining (43Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). In all affinity separations, the number of receptor molecules exceeded those of oligosaccharides by a factor of 10–100 to avoid saturation of the system. The molar ratio of oligosaccharides to growth factors was ∼1:10, as optimized in pilot runs. Effluent fractions from affinity chromatographies of oligosaccharide libraries were pooled as indicated, desalted on PD-10 columns, and further analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC on ProPac PA-1. Reapplication experiments were performed with a number of combinations of FGF and FR, in which bound and unbound pools were separately reapplied to the FR·AP columns and eluted as described above. Formation of FGF-Heparin-FR Ternary Complex—The ability of HS-related oligosaccharides to support formation of ternary complexes with FGFs and FRs was assessed by affinity chromatography of radiolabeled oligosaccharides on immobilized FR·AP in the presence of the growth factors. The FR·AP fusion proteins were immobilized through their AP domains, presumably in dimerized form due to AP dimer formation in solution (44Chang Z. Meyer K. Rapraeger A.C. Friedl A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In pilot experiments aimed at defining the experimental conditions conducive to FGF-saccharide-FR ternary complex formation, large [3H]heparin oligomers (>18-mers) (Fig. 1A) were applied to the receptor columns in the presence or absence of FGFs. In the absence of FGF, the oligosaccharides emerged quantitatively in the unbound pool (unretarded in 0.15 m NaCl) from each of the receptors FR2c (Fig. 1B), FR1c, or FR3c (data not shown). When added instead together with FGF1 or FGF2, the same oligosaccharides were retained on the three receptor columns (data not shown) and required 0.5-1.4 m NaCl for elution. Conversely, FGFs added in the absence of heparin oligomers were essentially quantitatively eluted with 0.2 m NaCl from the FR1c column, as demonstrated by SDSPAGE, whereas both FGF1 and FGF2 were observed in fractions up to 1.4 m NaCl in the presence of oligosaccharides (data not shown). These results provide evidence for the formation of ternary complexes in which the heparin oligosaccharides interact with both the FR and the FGF components. The addition of soluble FR·AP to receptor columns after sample application did not change subsequent oligosaccharide elution patterns, in accord with the notion that receptors were already dimerized on the affinity matrix. Dependence on Oligosaccharide Size—A variety of techniques, including crystallography as well as several binding and signaling assays, have been used to demonstrate that heparin oligosaccharides of different sizes mediate interactions between various FGFs and FRs (20Guimond S.

We therefore tested our assembly assay for oligosaccharide size requirements, in different combinations with FGFs and FRs. Size-defined, radiolabeled heparin oligomers (≥6-mer) were applied together with FGF1 or FGF2 to FR affinity columns. Two typical experiments are shown in Fig. 1B, in which heparin 10and 12-mer fractions showed a broad distribution of retarded components that emerged from 0.3 to 0.8 m NaCl and from 0.4 to 1.4 m NaCl for 10and 12-mer oligomers, respectively. Based on these pilot experiments, oligomers eluted with >0.2 m salt were all considered capable of complex formation, whereas complex stability was reflected by the actual elution position in the salt gradient. In the following, an arbitrary distinction between “moderate affinity binding” (>0.2–0.4 m NaCl) and “high affinity binding” (>0.4 m NaCl) will be applied. Heparin 8-mers were the shortest fragments capable of (largely moderate affinity) complex formation of FGF1 with FR1c, FR2c, or FR3c (Fig. 2A). Decasaccharides revealed a larger proportion of complex-bound species, as well as an increase in the proportion of high affinity binders. With 12-mers, no further increase in complex generation was obtained, although a slight increase in affinity was noted. FGF2, on the other hand, required smaller heparin oligomers than FGF1 for complex formation with each of the three receptors (Fig. 2A). An 8-mer induced maximal complex formation, only a slight increase in apparent affinity being observed with larger oligosaccharides (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Repeat analyses gave patterns very similar to those shown in Fig. 2A, with no significant deviations between different FRs (data not shown). Contrary to FR1c–3c, FR4 retained >18-mer heparin oligosaccharides even in the absence of FGF ligands, with an affinity reflected by elution at 0.4–0.6 m NaCl (data not shown). This property also applied to shorter oligosaccharides, essentially down to 10-mer size (Fig. 2B). Co-application with FGF1 promoted complex formation of even smaller heparin fragments (6and 8-mers) and also led to increased complex stability. Only minor changes were observed upon co-application of FGF2 when compared with control runs without FGF (Fig. 2B). When compared with FGF2, FGF1 thus was more prone to complex formation with heparin oligosaccharides and FR4, contrary to the effects seen with FR1c–3c (Fig. 2, A and B, and data not shown). Dependence on O-Sulfation—The oligosaccharides obtained by deaminative cleavage of unmodified heparin were predominantly N-sulfated and contained mostly 2-O-sulfated IdoUA and 6-O-sulfated GlcN residues. To assess the importance of different O-sulfate substituents, we generated endgroup 3H-labeled, size-defined oligosaccharide libraries that were designed to provide extensive sequence diversity with regard to O-sulfation. Oligosaccharides devoid of 6-O-sulfate groups were fractionated with regard to the extent of 2-O-sulfation, and each subclass was subjected to enzymatic 6-O-sulfation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each resulting library thus contained species with a fixed number of 2-O-sulfate but a variable number of 6-O-sulfate groups. Both the 2-O-sulfate and the 6-O-sulfate groups were variably distributed within the oligomers (37Jemth P. Kreuger J. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sturiale L. Giménez-Gallego G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30567-30573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The libraries were separately applied to the FR-columns, in different combinations with FGF1 and FGF2. 2-O-Sulfation—Oligosaccharides with two 2-O-sulfate groups (and variable 6-O-sulfation) generated small proportions of moderate affinity complexes with FGF1 and FR1c or FR2c. Three and four 2-O-sulfate groups lead to increased amounts of ternary complex, still of largely moderate affinity type, and also to some complex formation with FR3c (Fig. 3). Affinity separations with FGF2 showed generally higher yields of complexes and larger proportions of high affinity species. These binding patterns were underpinned in corresponding experiments with 10-mer libraries, with a tendency toward promotion of high affinity complexes. The relative but consistent preference for FGF2 over FGF1 in complex formation of oligosaccharide libraries with receptors FR1c–3c agrees well with the results obtained with fully sulfated heparin oligomers (Fig. 2A). Similar to the fully sulfated 10-mers derived from unmodified heparin (Fig. 2B), 10-mer libraries containing at least three 2-O-sulfate groups showed appreciable binding to FR4 even in the absence of FGFs (Fig. 3D). Again, the addition of FGF2 had only marginal effect. FGF1, on the other hand, greatly promoted complex formation of both 8and 10-mer libraries with FR4 (Fig. 3D). Although significant binding was observed already with mono-2-O-sulfated fragments, increased 2-O-sulfation led to augmented complex formation and to higher affinity interaction with FGF1 and FR4. 6-O-Sulfation—The impact of 6-O-sulfation on ternary complex formation was evaluated in two types of experiments. First, library oligosaccharides separated on FR columns in the presence of FGF1 or FGF2 were further analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC to assess 6-O-sulfate contents. Fig. 4 illustrates this approach with a library based on 10-mers containing three 2-O-sulfate groups. The unfractionated 10-mers were found to range from zero to four 6-O-sulfate groups (Fig. 4A, (3 + x), indicating numbers of 2-Oand 6-O-sulfate groups, respectively). Separation of this library on an FR1c column in the presence of FGF1 yielded ∼60% unbound fraction (Fig. 3A). Analysis of the unbound material by anion-exchange HPLC showed (3 + 0) components but no significant amounts of 6-Osulfated oligosaccharides (Fig. 4B). The bound fraction (∼40%), eluted within the >0.2–2.0 m range of the gradient (thus including both moderate affinity and high affinity species) contained virtually all 6-O-sulfated components ((3 + 2), (3 + 3), (3 + 4); (3 + 1) was difficult to evaluate due to low abundance in starting material) of the unfractionated library (Fig. 4C). A small proportion of (3 + 0) components found in the bound pool (Fig. 4C), was due to incomplete resolution during affinity chromatography (see the second approach below). Taken together, these results suggested that N-sulfated 10-mers with three 2-Osulfate groups could mediate binding of FGF1 to immobilized FR1c, only if they carried in addition a minimum of two (possibly only one) 6-O-sulfate residues. In a second approach, library oligosaccharides were first fractionated by anion-exchange HPLC followed by affinity chromatography of the separated fractions. The results obtained, illustrated in Fig. 5 for the 10-mer library carrying three 2-O-sulfate groups per molecule, confirm and extend the conclusions of separations performed in the reverse order (Fig. 4). Isolated (3 + 0) 10-mers, thus lacking 6-O-sulfate groups, were not retained by the FR1c column in the presence of FGF1, at 0.2 m NaCl concentration, whereas a small proportion of the (3 + 2) fraction bound with moderate affinity. Fragments with three or four 6-O-sulfate groups yielded larger proportions of ternary complex and increased stability of complexes, as predicted (Fig. 5). In this particular 10-mer library, penta O-sulfated components within the (3 + 2) subfraction represented the least sulfated species compatible with FGF1-FR1c complex formation. To investigate whether both 2-Oand 6-O-sulfate groups were required, fragments lacking either type of substituents were prepared (see “Experimental Procedures”) and tested for FGF1FR1c binding. An N-sulfated decamer containing four 2-O-or 6-O-sulfate groups thus showed minor binding, which was slightly increased by the addition of a fifth 2-O- or 6-O-sulfate group (Fig. 5). Taken together, these findings suggest that N-sulfated 10-mers containing four or five O-sulfate residues, irrespective of type, are capable of interacting with FGF1 and FR1c at higher than physiologic ionic strength. The experimental strategies illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5 were applied to various combinations of oligosaccharides, FGFs and FRs. In Fig. 6 are oligosaccharides classified as non-binding, moderately binding, and strongly binding, according to the criteria defined. FGF1 required 8or 10-mers with at least 5 O-sulfate groups for moderate binding to FR1c–3c and 10-mers with"

In a proteomics screening to identify novel survivin-binding partners, we found that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) directly associates with survivin in vitro and in co-immunoprecipitation experiments in vivo. This interaction is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal end of AIP, which contains three tetratricopeptide motifs, and involves the carboxyl terminus coiled coil in survivin with critical roles of Asp142 in AIP recognition. A survivin mutant lacking only Asp142 fails to bind AIP and exhibits accelerated degradation in vivo in a reaction reversed by a proteasome inhibitor. Acute knock-down of AIP by short interference RNA or competition of the survivin-AIP complex by peptidyl mimicry destabilizes survivin levels in cells, with enhanced apoptosis but no changes in cell cycle progression. Therefore, AIP regulates survivin stability, thus elevating a cellular anti-apoptotic threshold. The survivin-AIP complex may influence the cellular xenobiotic response to environmental toxin(s) and contribute to subcellular chaperone trafficking during cell death regulation.

The survivin-AIP complex may influence the cellular xenobiotic response to environmental toxin(s) and contribute to subcellular chaperone trafficking during cell death regulation. The IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) family comprises evolutionarily conserved members that act to buffer cell death stimuli by associating with caspases, the effector enzymes of apoptosis, and prevent their catalytic activation and/or activity (1Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Among IAP proteins, survivin is structurally and functionally unique, as has been implicated not only in preservation of cell viability but also in essential regulatory circuitries of cell division (2Altieri D.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8581-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), potentially by regulating chromosomal segregation (3Earnshaw W.C.

Cell. 2006; 17: 1483-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently, a third emerging function of survivin has been identified in the cellular stress response. This is centered on two potentially intersecting pathways: the association of survivin with the molecular chaperone Hsp90 (5Fortugno P. Beltrami E. Plescia J. Fontana J. Pradhan D. Marchisio P.C.

Although changes in survivin gene transcription have been invoked in the latter response (7Yang L. Cao Z. Li F. Post D.E. Van Meir E.G. Zhong H. Wood W.C. Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), other results have highlighted the role of rapid adaptive mechanisms regulating survivin protein expression, either through post-translational modifications that affect survivin stability, such as phosphorylation (8O'Connor D.S.

To further define the molecular partners that affect survivin stability/subcellular shuttling and thus regulate its multiple functions (2Altieri D.C.

Cell Culture and Reagents—Cervical carcinoma HeLa, breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7, and lymphoblastoid Raji cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in culture as recommended by the supplier. An antibody to AIP was purchased from NOVUS Biologicals (Littleton, CO). A rabbit polyclonal antibody to survivin was from NOVUS. Antibodies against XIAP and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α were obtained from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA), and Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA), respectively. Biotin-conjugated peptides duplicating a survivin-binding site for AIP or its scrambled sequence were synthesized, purified by high pressure liquid chromatography to >95% purity, and confirmed by mass spectrometry (Peptron, Daejeon, South Korea). Biotin-conjugated peptides were made cell-permeable by fusing the human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein basic domain cell-penetrating sequence YGRKKRRQRRR at the NH2 terminus of each peptide, as described (13Plescia J. Salz W. Xia F. Pennati M. Zaffaroni N. Daidone M.G. Meli M. Dohi T. Fortugno P. Nefedova Y. Gabrilovich D.I. Colombo G. Altieri D.C. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Amplification and cloning oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen. Molecular Cloning of AIP, Survivin, and Deletion Mutants— Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. After first strand cDNA synthesis using SuperScript (Invitrogen), an AIP transcript was amplified using primers 5′-AAAGAATTCGGAAGGAGGATGGCGGATATC-3′ and 5′-AAACTCGAGGTCAATGGGAGAAGATCCCCC-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and inserted in pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen) or pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences) vectors to generate pcDNA-AIP and pGEX-AIP, respectively. An amino-terminal fragment of AIP containing residues 1-169 was generated by inserting a stop codon at position 170 using a 3′ primer 5′-TTTTTCTCGAGTCAGGCCCATGGGTCCTGCTG-3′. A carboxyl-terminal fragment of AIP comprising residues 170-330 was amplified with 5′ primer 5′-AAAAAGAATTCATGACAGACGAAGAGAAGGCAAAG-3′. A wild type survivin cDNA (residues 1-142) has been described (6Dohi T. Beltrami E. Wall N.R. Plescia J. Altieri D.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The following primers were used to generate various survivin deletion mutants, 5′-AAAAACTCGAGCGGCCGCATCGT-3′ and 5′-AAAAACTCGAGCTAGATGGCACGGCGCACTTTC-3′ (survivin 1-135); 5′-AAAAACTCGAGCGGCCGCATCGT-3′ and 5′-AAAAACTCGAGTCACATGGCAGCCAGCTGCTCGATG-3′ (survivin 1-141), 5′-AAAAAAGGATCCACGCGGAACCAGATC-3′ and 5′-AAAAAGGATCCGAGCAGCTGGCTGCCATGGAT-3′ (survivin 136-142), 5′-AAAAACTCGAGCGGCCGCATCGT-3′ and 5′-AAAAACTCGAGTCACAGCTGCTCGATGGCACGGCG-3′ (survivin 88-138); 5′-AAAAACTCGAGCGGCCGCATCGT-3′ and 5′-AAAAACTCGAGTCAGGCAGCCAGCTGCTCGATGG-3′ (survivin 88-140); and 5′-AAAAACTCGAGCGGCCGCATCGT-3′ and 5′-AAAAACTCGAGTCACATGGCAGCCAGCTGCTCGATG-3′ (survivin 88-141). Amplified PCR products were validated by DNA sequencing and inserted in the EcoRI and XhoI cloning sites of pcDNA 3.0 or pGEX-4T vectors for expression in mammalian or prokaryotic cells, respectively. Plasmid DNA was prepared with a HiSpeed Plasmid Max kit (Qiagen) for mammalian cell transfection or transcription/translation in vitro. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus-RIL (Stratagene) strain with induction in 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h at 30 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 20 min, suspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, the soluble fractions were mixed with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 1 min, beads containing proteins were washed three times in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and further purified by chromatography over Econo-column (Bio-Rad) after overnight thrombin (Sigma) treatment to release the GST frame. The protein concentrations were measured using a protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) with BSA as standard. Identification of Novel Survivin-binding Protein(s)—HeLa cells were harvested by scraping and centrifugation followed by washing in ice-cold PBS. The cell pellet was suspended in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, plus protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) under continuous agitation for 30 min at 4 °C. After removal of the insoluble fraction, the cell extract was precleared with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h at 4°C. The lysate was mixed with control GST beads or GST beads coupled to recombinant survivin and washed with 20 bead volume of PBS, and bound proteins were eluted in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 1 m NaCl. The eluates were concentrated by precipitation with ProteoExtract protein precipitation kit (Calbiochem), and the pellets were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by silver staining (Genomine, Pohang, Kyungbuk, South Korea). Image analysis of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis gels was performed using the PDQuest software according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). The two-dimensional gel electrophoresis gel images obtained from GST or GST-survivin eluates were matched after normalization of total valid spot intensities. Spots detected exclusively in the eluate from GST-survivin were excised from the gel and enzymatically digested with sequence grade trypsin (Promega). After extraction from the gel, the peptides were analyzed using an Ettan matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight system (Amersham Biosciences), and candidate sequences were matched to the SWISS-PROT and NCBI databases using the search program ProFound (prowl.rockefeller.edu). In Vitro Pulldown, Capture Assay, and Immunoprecipitation—GST or GST-survivin equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 was incubated with aliquots of Raji cell extracts for 16 h at 4 °C in the presence of protease inhibitors. Bound proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and detected by Western blotting, as described (5Fortugno P. Beltrami E. Plescia J. Fontana J. Pradhan D. Marchisio P.C. Sessa W.C. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13791-13796Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Alternatively, 35S-labeled survivin or 35S-labeled AIP was generated using a TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences), mixed with GST, GST-AIP, or GST-survivin, and bound proteins were detected by autoradiography. In another series of experiments, Raji cell extracts were incubated with control IgG or an antibody to survivin, and the immune complexes were precipitated by the addition of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100. After washes, the pellets or supernatants were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting. Transfection Experiments—Two independent double-stranded (ds) RNA oligonucleotides targeting the AIP sequence CCAUGACAGACGAAGAGAA (AIP 1) or UGGUGGUCGAGGAGUACUA (AIP 2) were synthesized (Dharmacon). A control dsRNA oligonucleotide (VIII) ACUCUAUCUGCACGCUGAC matched for length and GC content was also synthesized. For gene silencing by small interfering RNA (siRNA), dsRNA oligonucleotides were mixed with oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in OPTI-MEM I (Invitrogen) medium, and the mixture was incubated with HeLa cells for 4 h at 37 °C,as described (14Beltrami E.

The cultures were supplemented with 10% serum and 1% antibiotics and further incubated for 48 or 72 h before analysis of AIP knock-down and modulation of survivin expression. For cycloheximide block experiments, MCF-7 cells were transfected at 60% confluency with 1 μg of pcDNA-HA-survivin or 2 μg of pcDNA-HA-survivin1-141 cDNA, by Lipofectamine. After 24 h, transfected cells were treated with 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, harvested after 0, 5, 10, and 20 h, and analyzed with an antibody to survivin by Western blotting as described (15Wall N.R. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Pommier Y. Altieri D.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 230-235PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—MCF-7 cells grown on glass slides were incubated in complete growth medium with increasing concentrations of cell-permeable AIP-directed or control scrambled peptide. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 22 °C, washed three times in PBS, pH 7.4, and permeablized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 min. After blocking in 3% BSA plus 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h at 22 °C, the slides were incubated with Streptavidin-Texas Red (Invitrogen) for 1 h, counterstained with 0.1 mg/ml 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole for 1 min, rinsed, mounted in 90% glycerol, and sealed with nail polish, as described (13Plescia J.

Cell Viability and Apoptosis Assays—Determination of cell viability in peptide-treated cells or after siRNA knock-down of AIP was carried out using an MTT assay in the presence of 1 mg/ml thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich) and quantified by absorbance at 595 nm, as described (13Plescia J. Salz W. Xia F. Pennati M. Zaffaroni N. Daidone M.G. Meli M. Dohi T. Fortugno P. Nefedova Y. Gabrilovich D.I. Colombo G. Altieri D.C.

For these experiments, MCF-7 cells were transfected with control or AIP-directed dsRNA oligonucleotide, treated after 48 h with 500 μm of the DNA-damaging agent etoposide or exposed to UVB irradiation (100 J/m2), and analyzed for cell viability after an additional 20 h of incubation, by an MTT assay. Alternatively, MCF-7 cell cultures were treated with 0.5 μm staurosporine (Sigma-Aldrich) or 100 μm etoposide (Bedford Laboratories, Bedford, OH) for 16 h, loaded with cell-permeable control scrambled peptide or AIP-directed peptide, and analyzed for cell viability after an additional 4 h of incubation, by an MTT assay. In other experiments, analysis of apoptosis after AIP knock-down was carried out in the presence or absence of UVB irradiation (100 J/m2) by simultaneous analysis of caspase-3 activity (DEVDase activity, green fluorescence) and DNA content (propidium iodide, red fluorescence) using the CaspaTag Caspase-3/7 in situ assay kit (Chemicon), as described previously (13Plescia J.

Peptide Binding Studies—Recombinant AIP was immobilized onto 96-well plates (2 μg/well) for 16 h at 4 °C. The wells were blocked with 30 mg/ml BSA and further incubated with 100 μm of biotin-labeled survivin-derived synthetic peptide duplicating the AIP-binding site or control scrambled sequence. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the wells were mixed with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C, and peptide binding was determined by the addition of 4-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at an absorbance of 405 nm (13Plescia J.

Statistical Analysis—The data were analyzed using an unpaired t test on a GraphPad software package for Windows (Prism). All of the statistical tests were two-sided. A p value of 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Identification of AIP as a Novel Survivin-interacting Protein— We used a proteomics screening to identify novel proteins that bind to survivin and may regulate its function(s). A protein spot with apparent molecular weight of ∼37,600, and a pI of 6.8 was specifically detected in eluates from GST-survivin beads, but not GST alone (Fig. 1A). This candidate survivin-interacting molecule was identified from peptide mass fingerprinting with 31% sequence coverage as the AIP (Fig. 1B), also designated ARA9 or XAP2 (16Kuzhandaivelu N. Cong Y.

Characterization of a Survivin-AIP Complex—In pulldown experiments, incubation of Raji cell extracts with GST-survivin resulted in strong association with AIP, by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). In contrast, GST did not bind AIP (Fig. 2A). In addition, 35S-labeled in vitro transcribed and translated AIP strongly associated with GST-survivin, whereas no interaction with GST was observed (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the association between AIP and survivin was direct, we performed in vitro pulldown experiments with isolated recombinant proteins. In these experiments, survivin and AIP reciprocally interacted, whereas no binding of either protein to GST was demonstrated (Fig. 2C). Finally, survivin immune complexes precipitated from Raji cell extracts contained the molecular chaperone Hsp90, in agreement with previous observations (5Fortugno P. Beltrami E. Plescia J. Fontana J. Pradhan D. Marchisio P.C. Sessa W.C. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13791-13796Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and AIP in vivo (Fig. 2D). In contrast, immune complexes precipitated with a control IgG did not contain Hsp90 or AIP (Fig. 2D). Structure-Function Analysis of the Survivin-AIP Complex— Several recombinant deletion mutants of AIP or survivin were generated and characterized in pulldown experiments. A schematic diagram of AIP (Fig. 3A) and survivin (Fig. 3B) and their respective functional domains is shown. Full-length AIP or AIP170-330 (AIP-C) comprising its three tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats (18Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11452-11456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) strongly associated with recombinant survivin in pulldown experiments (Fig. 3C). In contrast, AIP1-169 (AIP-N) containing the FKBP12 homology region or GST did not bind recombinant survivin (Fig. 3C). In reciprocal experiments, the carboxyl-terminal α-helical coiled-coil region of survivin (survivin88-142, SVV-C) strongly associated with 35S-labeled in vitro transcribed and translated AIP (Fig. 3D). In contrast, survivin1-87 (SVV-N) containing the baculovirus IAP repeat only very weakly associated with recombinant AIP, and GST showed no reactivity (Fig. 3D). To map more precisely the binding site for AIP, serial deletion mutants of the survivin carboxyl-terminal region were generated and analyzed in pulldown experiments. Survivin deletion mutants with sequential removal of the carboxyl terminus (SVV 88-138 and SVV 88-140) lost the ability to bind AIP, and even a survivin mutant (SVV 88-141) lacking only the last amino acid (Asp142) in the survivin sequence failed to associate with AIP (Fig. 3E). Consistent with these results, recombinant expression of the last seven amino acids in the survivin carboxyl terminus (SVV 136-142), thus comprising Asp142, was sufficient to restore binding to AIP in pulldown experiments (Fig. 3F). Coomassie Blue gel analysis revealed comparable input of the various recombinant survivin mutants used in these experiments (Fig. 3, E and F). To test whether Hsp90, which associates with both AIP (12Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2002; 141: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and survivin (5Fortugno P. Beltrami E. Plescia J. Fontana J. Pradhan D. Marchisio P.C. Sessa W.C. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13791-13796Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), modulates the survivin-AIP complex, we reconstituted this interaction in reticulocyte extracts. 35S-Labeled full-length survivin strongly bound recombinant AIP in pulldown experiments (Fig. 3G), in agreement with the data reported above. In contrast, a single amino acid survivin deletion mutant (SVV 1-141) lacking only Asp142 showed no significant binding to AIP, as compared with control incubations with GST (Fig. 3G). The addition of the Hsp90 ATPase pocket inhibitor 17-allylaminogeldanamycin did not significantly affect the interaction of wild type survivin or SVV 1-141 to AIP (Fig. 3G), thus indicating that Hsp90 expression or function does not modulate the survivin-AIP complex. Regulation of Survivin Stability by AIP—AIP contains an immunophilin homology domain (17Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8878-8884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 18Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11452-11456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and may exhibit chaperone-like activity (19Yano M. Terada K. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To begin to investigate the functional relevance of a survivin-AIP complex, we studied a potential role for AIP in regulating survivin stability. For these experiments, we transfected cells with HA-tagged full-length survivin (HA-survivin) or HA-survivin1-141, which is defective in AIP binding (Fig. 3, F and G). In cycloheximide block experiments, SVV 1-141 exhibited accelerated degradation as compared with full-length, wild type survivin (Fig. 4A). Densitometric quantification of protein bands revealed that deletion of the last survivin amino acid Asp142 resulted in a ∼5-h half-life, as opposed to the 10-h half-life of wild type survivin (Fig. 4B). We next asked whether AIP directly contributed to survivin stability. For these experiments, we used two independent siRNA sequences to knock down AIP expression in MCF-7 cells and monitored survivin levels. Transfection of MCF-7 cells with control siRNA did not affect survivin or AIP levels, by Western blotting (Fig. 4C). In contrast, acute knock-down of AIP resulted in significant reduction of survivin expression, whereas levels of another IAP family protein, XIAP, were not affected (Fig. 4C). Under these experimental conditions, the addition of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin restored survivin levels in AIP knock-down cells to those of control siRNA-transfected cultures (Fig. 4C). Modulation of Cell Viability by the Survivin-AIP Complex— Consistent with the data reported above (Fig. 4C), acute knock-down of AIP resulted in reduction of survivin levels in MCF-7 cells, whereas expression of β-actin was not affected (Fig. 5A). In addition, transfection with control or AIP-directed dsRNA oligonucleotides did not result in eukaryotic initiation factor 2α phosphorylation in these cells, thus ruling out activation of an interferon response (Fig. 5A). Under these experimental conditions, the loss of survivin after AIP knock-down was not associated with significant alterations in cell cycle progression as revealed by DNA content analysis, and mitotic transition, a cell cycle phase typically modulated by survivin, was not affected after control or siRNA knock-down of AIP (Fig. 5B). We next asked whether AIP knock-down and concomitant reduction in survivin levels sensitized cells to apoptosis. Exposure of cells transfected with control siRNA to a suboptimal dose of UVB resulted in a modest increase in effector caspase activity, by multiparametric flow cytometry (Fig. 5C), and approximately ∼40% decrease in cell viability using an MTT assay (Fig. 5D). In contrast, siRNA knock-down of AIP resulted in enhanced cell death with increased effector caspase activity, loss of plasma membrane integrity (Fig. 5C), and further reduction in long term cell viability, by MTT analysis (Fig. 5D). siRNA knock-down of AIP was also associated with further reduction in cell viability induced by the DNA-damaging agent etoposide as compared with control siRNA-treated cultures (Fig. 5D). To further test a role of AIP in regulating survivin stability and cytoprotection, we used the survivin carboxyl-terminal sequence SVV136-142, EQLAAMD, which recapitulates AIP binding (Fig. 3F), as an antagonist to disrupt the survivin-AIP complex in vivo. This survivin-derived synthetic peptide specifically bound recombinant AIP (Fig. 6A), and in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6A, inset), by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In contrast, a control peptide with the same sequence in scrambled order did not bind recombinant AIP (Fig. 6A, inset). Cell-permeable variants of biotinylated scrambled peptide or the survivin sequence SVV136-142 comparably accumulated inside MCF-7 cells, by fluorescence microscopy with streptavidin-Texas Red (Fig. 6B). Transduction of MCF-7 cultures with cell-permeable SVV136-142 resulted in the reduction of survivin levels, but not XIAP or β-actin, by Western blotting, suggestive of physical disruption of the survivin-AIP complex in vivo (Fig. 6C). In contrast, transduction of MCF-7 cells with a control scrambled peptide did not affect survivin or XIAP expression, as compared with untreated cultures (Fig. 6C). Under these experimental conditions, transduction of MCF-7 cells with cell-permeable SVV136-142 resulted in dose-dependent reduction in long term cell viability and enhanced cell death induced by staurosporine and etoposide, by MTT (Fig. 6D). In contrast, comparable concentrations of cell-permeable control scrambled peptide were ineffective (Fig. 6D).FIGURE 6Disruption of the survivin-AIP complex enhances cell death. A, peptide binding. A biotin-conjugated survivin peptide duplicating the AIP-binding site EQLAAMD or control scrambled sequence LEMADQA was incubated with recombinant AIP with detection of binding by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The data are the means ± S.D. of triplicate samples. Inset, concentration-dependent binding of control scrambled peptide (open circles) or survivin peptide (closed circles) to AIP. B, intracellular penetration. MCF-7 cells were incubated with biotin-conjugated, cell-permeable survivin or control scrambled peptide, stained with propidium iodide plus Streptavidin-Texas Red, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. C, regulation of survivin stability. MCF-7 cells transduced with control scrambled peptide or survivin peptide were analyzed by Western blotting. D, cell proliferation/cell viability. MCF-7 cells were treated with the cell death stimuli staurosporine (STS) or etoposide in the presence or absence of control scrambled peptide or survivin peptide (μm) and analyzed for cell viability by an MTT assay. ***, p = 0.0005; **, p = 0.0023-0.0028; *, p = 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we have used a proteomics screening to identify the AIP (16Kuzhandaivelu N.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11452-11456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) as a novel survivin-binding partner. Survivin associates with AIP directly in vitro and in vivo through a recognition largely mediated by the last carboxyl terminus residue in survivin, Asp142. Experiments with acute AIP knock-down by siRNA, competition of the survivin-AIP complex using synthetic peptidyl mimicry, and expression of a survivin mutant defective in AIP binding (SVV1-141) all pointed to a role for this interaction in promoting survivin stability in vivo and preserving an anti-apoptotic threshold in the cytosol. Contributing to its multifunctional role in cell division and cell viability (2Altieri D.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8581-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), survivin exhibits adaptive changes in protein stability and dynamic trafficking among multiple subcellular compartments (9Fortugno P. Wall N.R. Giodini A. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Padgett K.M. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 575-585PubMed Google Scholar), which include various aspects of the mitotic apparatus (10Vong Q.P. Cao K. Li H.Y. Iglesias P.A. Zheng Y. Science. 2005; 310: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the nucleus (20Rodriguez J.A. Span S.W. Ferreira C.G. Kruyt F.A. Giaccone G. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 275: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and a specialized mitochondrial pool specifically involved in apoptosis inhibition (6Dohi T. Beltrami E. Wall N.R. Plescia J. Altieri D.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In this context, AIP recognition provides a novel mechanism for regulation of survivin levels, potentially linked to the Hsp90 chaperone system. AIP, also known as ARA-9 or XAP-2, binds the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a ligand-activated member of the basic-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim family of transcription factors (12Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2002; 141: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This molecule is the main effector of the cellular response to environmental toxicants, especially 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, commonly referred to as TCDD or dioxin, and acts via induced transcription of phase I detoxification cytochrome P-450 genes (12Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2002; 141: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Despite its structural similarities with immunophilins, AIP is thought to stabilize the unliganded aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the cytosol via its carboxyl-terminal TPR motifs (11Bell D.R. Poland A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36407-36414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), thus preventing ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal destruction. In turn, this causes increase in overall cytosolic receptor levels (21LaPres J.J. Glover E. Dunham E.E. Bunger M.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6153-6159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and enhanced detoxification signaling potentially via inhibition of receptor nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling (22Petrulis J.R. Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37448-37453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A third component of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-AIP complex is Hsp90, which associates with AIP through the TPR motifs (23Meyer B.K. Perdew G.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8907-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and binds the aryl hydrocarbon receptor via its middle domain (23Meyer B.K. Perdew G.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8907-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A similar paradigm may apply to survivin, which binds independently to AIP (this study) and Hsp90 (5Fortugno P. Beltrami E. Plescia J. Fontana J. Pradhan D. Marchisio P.C. Sessa W.C. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13791-13796Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), with both interactions required to enhance its stability in the cytosol by preventing ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal destruction. Structurally, the last carboxyl terminus residue in survivin, Asp142, has been shown to play a critical role in AIP recognition. This is reminiscent of the binding requirements between the TPR motifs in the co-chaperone p60hop and the carboxyl-terminal domain of Hsp90, as determined by biochemical analysis and x-ray crystallography (24Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 25Brinker A. Scheufler C. von der Mulbe F. Fleckenstein B. Herrmann C. Jung G. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19265-19275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In addition to deletion experiments, blocking the carboxylate group at the survivin carboxyl terminus using an HA tag also suppressed the interaction with AIP (not shown), suggesting that an association between two carboxylate groups, one from Asp142 and the other from the peptide backbone, may provide most of the binding interface for the TPR-containing domain of AIP. The more functional consequences of the survivin-AIP complex were probed using two independent approaches: acute knock-down of AIP levels by siRNA and peptidyl mimicry of the interaction using a cell-permeable peptide modeled on the carboxyl-terminal survivin-AIP binding interface. Both approaches resulted in only a partial suppressive effect on either AIP expression or the integrity of the survivin-AIP complex. However, both strategies resulted in destabilization of survivin levels via proteasome-dependent destruction, reduced cell viability and enhanced apoptosis by suboptimal doses of cell death agonists, including UVB, etoposide, and staurosporine. This phenotype is consistent with several previous studies demonstrating that acute loss of survivin levels in tumor cells results in spontaneous or synergistic induction of apoptosis by cell death stimuli (2Altieri D.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8581-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), potentially by critically lowering an anti-apoptotic threshold in the cytosol. In addition, survivin cytoprotection has been consistently associated with its cytosolic pool (9Fortugno P. Wall N.R. Giodini A. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Padgett K.M. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 575-585PubMed Google Scholar), in dynamic equilibrium with a fraction of survivin compartmentalized in mitochondria and discharged in the cytosol in response to cell death stimuli (6Dohi T. Beltrami E. Wall N.R. Plescia J. Altieri D.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In this context, it is intriguing that AIP has been implicated not only in affecting nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (22Petrulis J.R. Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37448-37453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but also in more global chaperone mechanisms of mitochondrial import of preproteins via an interaction between its TPR motifs and the carboxyl-terminal region of the translocase of the outer membrane molecule, Tom20 (19Yano M. Terada K. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Whether AIP promotes survivin stability in the cytosol and enhances its mitochondrial import requires further investigation. However, the data presented here suggest that the survivin-AIP complex may be selectively involved in cytoprotection, which is typically mediated by mitochondrial survivin discharged in the cytosol (6Dohi T. Beltrami E. Wall N.R. Plescia J. Altieri D.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), rather than mitotic regulation that involves a distinct subcellular pool of the molecule (9Fortugno P. Wall N.R. Giodini A. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Padgett K.M. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 575-585PubMed Google Scholar). In sum, we have identified survivin as a novel component of a dynamic chaperone complex that controls cellular responses to environmental toxins via a direct recognition of AIP. This is consistent with an emerging role for survivin in preserving cell viability and potentially cell proliferation during the cellular stress response and fits well with the already documented interaction between survivin and Hsp90 (5Fortugno P. Beltrami E. Plescia J. Fontana J. Pradhan D. Marchisio P.C. Sessa W.C. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13791-13796Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) as an additional component of the AIP complex (11Bell D.R. Poland A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36407-36414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that signaling through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and its complex extends beyond detoxification mechanisms against environmental threats and may also involve modulation of endogenous intracellular signaling pathways linked to cell proliferation (26Kolluri S.K. Weiss C. Koff A. Gottlicher M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1742-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 27Puga A. Barnes S.J. Dalton T.P. Chang C.-Y. Knudsen E.S. Maier M.A. J. Biol.

De Luca L.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2835-2838PubMed Google Scholar), and differentiation/cell viability (29Zaher H. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Letterio J. Sheikh M.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. Roberts A.B. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Survivin, with its multifunctional roles (2Altieri D.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8581-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), appears ideally positioned to participate not only in the exogenous stress response mediated by this chaperone complex but also in potential endogenous pathways of cellular adaptation, which may require elevation of survivin levels via rapid changes in protein stability and dynamic shuttling among specialized subcellular compartments (9Fortugno P. Wall N.R. Giodini A. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Padgett K.M. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 575-585PubMed Google Scholar)."

The suppressive effect of hyaluronan was neutralized by a monoclonal antibody that specifically inhibits hyaluronan binding to its receptor CD44. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the PDGF β-receptor and CD44 can form a complex. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of hyaluronan on PDGF β-receptor activation was not seen in the presence of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate. Our observations suggest that hyaluronan suppresses PDGF β-receptor activation by recruiting a CD44-associated tyrosine phosphatase to the receptor.

Hyaluronan is the most common glycosaminoglycan present in the extracellular matrix of mammalian tissues, for example in epidermis and dermis. It is synthesized by both normal and malignant cells, such as fibroblasts (2Heldin P. Laurent T.C. Heldin C.-H. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 919-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and breast cancer cells (3Heldin P. de la Torre M. Ytterberg D. Bergh J. Oncol. Rep. 1996; 3: 1011-1016PubMed Google Scholar), and is involved in a variety of physiological events, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (4Toole B.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). The ability of hyaluronan to affect cell migration has been attributed partly to its physicochemical properties; hyaluronan molecules form continuous and porous biological meshworks that exhibit visco-elastic properties. This property makes tissues resilient and malleable, which is important to facilitate cell motility during development, tissue remodeling, and cancer. Furthermore, several studies have provided evidence that hyaluronan exerts signaling effects through interactions with certain cell surface receptors, such as CD44 and RHAMM (5Bourguignon L.Y. Singleton P.A. Diedrich F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29654-29669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). The predominant receptor for hyaluronan is the cell surface adhesion receptor CD44 that is expressed in most cell types transferring signals from the outside of the cell to the inside in response to hyaluronan binding (7Knudson W. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D604-D615Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8Hamada J. Sawamura Y. Van Meir E.G. Front.

CD44 exists in several isoforms because of alternative splicing of the gene, which can further undergo extensive post-translational modifications by glycosylation and addition of polysaccharide chains. This diversity in its structure accounts for its diverse biological functions and ability to interact with numerous other macromolecules in addition to hyaluronan, including collagen, fibronectin, growth factors, cytokines, and metalloproteinases (10Ponta H. Sherman L. Herrlich P.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar, 11Thorne R.F. Legg J.W. Isacke C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The most common form, CD44s (CD44 standard form), is expressed by a wide variety of cells, including hematopoietic cells and dermal fibroblasts. Studies have shown that CD44s facilitates lymphocyte homing and fibroblast migration during wound healing (12Jalkanen S. Bargatze R.F. de los Toyos J. Butcher E.C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 13Turley E.A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 14Greiling D. Clark R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 861-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Longer variant isoforms, termed CD44v, are found on endothelial cells, epithelial cells, activated lymphocytes, and some tumor cells. The cytoplasmic domain of CD44 interacts with ERM proteins and ankyrin and thus indirectly with the cytoskeleton (10Ponta H. Sherman L. Herrlich P.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). Notably, among the three hyaluronan-synthesizing enzymes (Has1, -2, and -3), the Has2 isoform seems to be most important in mediating cell migration. For example, Has2-/- mouse cardiac endothelial cells display reduced ability to migrate, a process that can be reversed by gene rescue or by the addition of exogenous hyaluronan (15Camenisch T.D. Spicer A.P. Brehm-Gibson T. Biesterfeldt J. Augustine M.L. Calabro Jr., A. Kubalak S. Klewer S.E. McDonald J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). In addition, studies on various tumor cells, such as mesotheliomas, colon carcinomas, and breast cancer, revealed that cells lacking Has2 expression migrated much slower compared with Has2-expressing cells (16Jacobson A. Rahmanian M. Rubin K. Heldin P. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 102: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Li Y. Heldin P. Br. J.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6139-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, not all types of cells respond to hyaluronan by increased locomotion; Chinese hamster ovary cells (19Brinck J. Heldin P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and low metastatic murine T cell lymphoma cells (20Kubens B.S. Nikolai G. Zanker K.S.

Growth factors also play a central role in cell migration during both normal and pathological conditions, including embryogenesis, wound healing, and tumor invasion. In this regard, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) 2The abbreviations used are: PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFRβ, PDGF β-receptor; HABP, hyaluronan-binding protein; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.-BB is a powerful stimulator of the migration of mesenchymal cells, such as fibroblasts (21Heldin C.H.

PDGF-BB mediates its cellular effects through binding to α- and β-tyrosine kinase receptors (PDGFRα and PDGFRβ, respectively), resulting in receptor dimerization and activation through autophosphorylation; this leads to recruitment of Src homology 2 domain signal transduction molecules to the receptor (24Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that PDGFRβ and other tyrosine receptor kinases can be dephosphorylated by a number of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which thereby affect downstream signaling of the receptors (25Persson C. Savenhed C. Bourdeau A. Tremblay M.L. Markova B. Bohmer F.D. Haj F.G. Neel B.G. Elson A. Heldin C.H. Ronnstrand L. Ostman A. Hellberg C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2190-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The effects of growth factors and matrix components on cells are interdependent, because growth factors affect the synthesis of extracellular molecules and their degrading enzymes, whereas the extracellular macromolecules modulate growth factor-mediated cellular functions. Previous studies have demonstrated a synergism between αvβ3 integrin and PDGF-BB in mediating endothelial cell migration (26Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 27Woodard A.S. Garcia-Cardena G. Leong M. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. Languino L.R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 469-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the possibility that hyaluronan affects PDGF-BB-induced cell migration of human dermal fibroblast cultures. Cell Culture—Biopsies were taken from elective breast reduction surgery, after the approval of the patient (Department of Plastic Surgery, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden), and transported to the laboratory in chilled phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2 (PBS) but containing antibiotics (100 IU penicillin/ml and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml; Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden). Following a quick wash in 70% ethanol, the biopsy was washed with PBS and minced to 1-2-mm3 pieces with a razor blade. Dermis and epidermis were separated, using fine forceps, after an overnight incubation in 2.5 mg of dispase per ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (grade II, 0.5 units/ml; Roche Applied Science) (DMEM; Invitrogen) at 4 °C. Fibroblasts from the dermal sheets were then cultured from explants in complete medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowest) and antibiotics). Skin fibroblasts (passages 6-10) from the explants were used for all experiments. Cell Migration Assay—Human dermal fibroblasts (8 × 104 cells per well in 6-well plates) were cultured in complete medium for 24 h; thereafter, the medium was replaced with starvation medium. Then a wound was made by scraping the confluent cell cultures, crosswise, with the tip of a 1-ml pipette. The floating cells were washed away with DMEM supplemented with 0.1% FCS (starvation medium). The wound closure was monitored by an inverted microscope (Nikon) at four different positions along the wound, immediately and after different time periods up to 24 h in untreated cultures and in cultures treated with various concentrations of PDGF-BB. To investigate the effect of hyaluronan on fibroblast migration induced by 1 ng/ml PDGF-BB, the cultures were preincubated for 2 h with hyaluronan (1-100 μg/ml, Mr 0.5-1.5 × 106; Genzyme Hylumed) in the absence or presence of rat monoclonal Hermes-1 antibodies (used as serum-free supernatants from the myeloma culture; generously provided by Professor Sirpa Jalkanen, Turku, Finland), which specifically inhibits the binding of hyaluronan to the CD44 receptor. The cell migration was quantified by NIH Image 1.63 software. The data were exported to Excel and statistically analyzed by Student's t test. Analysis of Hyaluronan Synthesis—Fibroblasts (8 × 104 cells/well in 6-well plates) were grown for 24 h in complete medium, followed by a 24-h starvation. The quiescent cells received fresh starvation medium supplemented with various concentrations of PDGF-BB, and at various time points the hyaluronan content in the conditioned media was quantified, essentially as described previously (16Jacobson A. Rahmanian M. Rubin K. Heldin P. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 102: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The assay is based on the formation of a complex between hyaluronan and the hyaluronan-binding protein (HABP) domain of aggrecan, the binding of which essentially is irreversible. The HABP was isolated from crude bovine cartilage extract by affinity chromatography on a hyaluronan-EAH-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) (28Tengblad A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 578: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A part of this HABP was biotinylated with biotin-aminocaproic acid sulfo-NHS (catalog number B1022, Sigma). The assay was carried out on MaxiSorp 96-well Nunc-Immuno Plates (catalog number 439454, Nunc) that were precoated overnight with 1 μg of HABP/ml in 50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.5, washed in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20, and blocked in PBS containing 1% BSA. The hyaluronan standards (0-100 ng/ml) and samples of conditioned media, at appropriate dilutions in blocking solution, were then added, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Following washing, 100 μl of biotinylated HABP (b-HABP; 1 μg/ml) was added, and samples were incubated for 1 h. After excess washing, the b-HABP specifically bound to the immobilized hyaluronan was determined by incubation for 1 h with streptavidinbiotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (catalog number RNP1015V, Amersham Biosciences), followed by the addition of 100 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution (catalog number T4444, Sigma) for 15 min. 50 μl of 2 m H2SO4 was then added, and the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm. The hyaluronan content was calculated by comparing with a standard curve made from known concentrations of hyaluronan, and the values were statistically analyzed by Student's t test. Generation and Purification of Hermes-1 Fab Fragments—Eight mg of Hermes-1 IgG was extensively dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate and 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, followed by concentration to ∼0.5 ml using an Aminco Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (Mr 10,000 cutoff, Millipore). Fab fragments were then generated using ImmunoPure Fab preparation kit (catalog number 44885, Pierce) by5hof digestion at 37 °C with immobilized papain followed by purification according to the manufacturer. In addition, an UltraLink immobilized protein G column (catalog number 53127, Pierce) was used to remove Fc fragments and undigested IgG from Hermes-1 Fab fragments. Cell Adhesion Assay—Glass coverslips in 12-well culture dishes were coated with 0.5 mg/ml hyaluronan or 0.5% BSA (negative control for general attachment), in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 137 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 0.65 mm MgSO4, and 1.2 mm CaCl2 overnight in a cold room. Dermal fibroblasts were incubated for 24 h in starvation medium, trypsinized, washed, and diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml with starvation medium. The cells were then incubated for 30 min in the cold room without or with Hermes-1 IgG, Hermes-1 Fab fragments, or Hermes-3 IgG (ammonium sulfate precipitate from serum-free myeloma culture medium; generously provided by Professor Sirpa Jalkanen, Turku, Finland). Cell samples of 1 × 105 cells per coverslip were allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were removed with two washings in the above-described Hepes buffer, and the number of adhered cells was measured by the hexose-aminidase assay (29Landegren U. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 67: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). PDGFRβ Precipitation, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Normal human dermal fibroblasts (precipitation, 2 × 105 cells/6-cm culture dish; co-immunoprecipitation, 4 × 105 cells/10-cm culture dish) were starved as described above, exposed to hyaluronan, Hermes-1, and/or pervanadate, before stimulation with PDGF-BB for 15 min as indicated. Cultures were washed once with cold PBS and lysed on ice for 15 min in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate), supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mg/ml Pefabloc, 10 μm leupeptin). Lysates were collected in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, homogenized with a 20-gauge needle on ice; subsequently insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. PDGFRβ, in the cleared lysates, was absorbed to 12 μl of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Sepharose (Sigma) for 2 h endover-end at 4 °C. For co-immunoprecipitation, the cleared lysates were incubated for 2 h with 2 μg of polyclonal antiserum against PDGFRβ (CTβ; a generous gift from Dr. Carina Hellberg, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden) or 5 μg of anti-CD44 IgG (Hermes-1, purified by ammonium sulfate) before the addition of 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) per sample. As controls, rabbit IgG (I-5006, Sigma) and rat IgG (I-4131, Sigma) were used. PDGFRβ bound to WGA beads, or immunoprecipitates collected on protein A-Sepharose beads, were spun down, washed twice with lysis buffer, and resuspended in 30 μl of sample buffer with dithiothreitol, and heated 5 min at 99 °C to release the proteins from the beads; they were then subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane. After separation by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond™-C Extra, Amersham Biosciences) for immunoblotting. Nonspecific binding sites on the membrane were blocked with 5% defatted milk in TBS-T buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20), at room temperature for 1 h or overnight at 4 °C, followed by two washes in TBS-T. The membranes were then incubated with a monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99, 1 μg/ml; catalog number SC-7020, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PDGFRβ antibody (CTβ, 2 μg/ml), or CD44 antibody (1 μg/ml; Hermes-1) in TBS-T buffer containing 1% BSA overnight at 4 °C. After five washes in TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase IgG (1:3000; Amersham Biosciences), anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase IgG (1:3000; Amersham Biosciences), or anti-rat horseradish peroxidase IgG (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog number SC-2006) for the detection of phosphorylated PDGFRβ, total PDGFRβ, and hyaluronan receptor CD44 immune complexes, respectively. Immunoreactive bands were then detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The membranes were stripped with Stripping buffer (catalog number 21059, Pierce), before re-blotting with other antibodies, as specified. The integral densities of specific bands were quantified by two-dimensional densitometry and analyzed by Excel. Immunofluorescence Staining—Fibroblasts (2 × 104 cells per well in 4-well Falcon culture slides) were incubated in complete medium for 24 h followed by 24 h of starvation. Some of the cultures were incubated for 2 h with 100 μg/ml hyaluronan before a 15-min stimulation with 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB. The cultures were then washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After three washes, nonspecific staining was blocked by incubation in 20% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. For double staining of PDGFRβ and CD44, permeabilized cells (0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min) were incubated for 1 h with 3 μg/ml rabbit PDGFRβ antiserum, washed, and incubated for an additional 1 h with 1 μg/ml rat anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies (Hermes-1). As controls, rabbit IgG and rat IgG were used. After washing, monolayers were incubated for 1 h in the dark with secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 594 F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG (1 μg/ml, red, catalog number A11072, Molecular Probes) to detect PDGFRβ or goat biotinylated anti-rat IgG (5 μg/ml; catalog number BA9400, Vector Laboratories) and streptavidin Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (1 μg/ml, green; catalog number S11223, Molecular Probes) to detect CD44. For double staining of hyaluronan and CD44, nonpermeabilized cells were incubated with b-HABP (2 μg/ml) and Hermes-1 antibodies separately, followed by incubation with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 (1 μg/ml, green) to detect hyaluronan and goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 568 (2 μg/ml, red; catalog number A11077, Molecular Probes) to detect CD44. As controls, cells were pretreated for 1 h at 37°C with 20 units/ml Streptomyces hyaluronidase to digest hyaluronan and incubated with rat IgG instead of Hermes-1 antibodies. All washings were performed in the presence of 10% ethanol to avoid loss of hyaluronan. Each double staining was followed by staining of nuclei using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml; catalog number 1.24653, Merck) for 5 min. The processed cells were mounted in Fluoromount G (catalog number 0100-01, Immunokemi) and photographed with a Leica Microsystems microscope. PDGF-BB Induces Migration and Stimulates Hyaluronan Production by Human Dermal Fibroblasts—Because both PDGF-BB and hyaluronan have been implicated in cell migration (4Toole B.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 22Yu J. Moon A. Kim H.R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we investigated the importance of these molecules for migration of human dermal fibroblasts. First, we examined the effects of different concentrations of PDGF-BB both on migration and hyaluronan synthesis. In a wounding experiment in confluent cultures of dermal fibroblasts, PDGF-BB was found to stimulate in a dose-dependent manner the wound closure over a 24-h period. Maximum effect was seen at 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB; at this concentration, the wound in the cell culture healed about 3-fold faster than in unstimulated cell cultures (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows that the wound closure was almost complete in PDGF-BB-stimulated cultures after 24 h. Notably, PDGF-BB-stimulated cells exhibited an elongated and polarized morphology with membrane sheets, i.e. membrane ruffles or lamellipodia, at the leading edge of migrating dermal fibroblasts. These membrane sheets were stained with specific antibodies for the hyaluronan receptor CD44, demonstrating an accumulation of CD44 preferentially at the leading edge of the migrating cells (Fig. 1C). The nonstimulated fibroblasts exhibited less polarization and membrane ruffle formation than PDGF-BB-stimulated cells, but yet expressed CD44 at the leading edge of migrating cells (Fig. 1C). A 24-h stimulation of fibroblasts with 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB also induced an approximate 3-fold increase of hyaluronan amount (1.1 μg/ml) relative to unstimulated cells; 1 ng/ml PDGF-BB resulted in a 1.8-fold increase (about 0.7 μg/ml) (Fig. 1D). One ng of PDGF-BB per ml was the lowest concentration that gave significant effects on cell migration, as well as on hyaluronan production; this concentration was therefore chosen to investigate if endogenously produced hyaluronan affected PDGF-BB-mediated fibroblast migration. Culturing of the dermal fibroblasts in the presence of Streptomyces hyaluronidase, which specifically degrades hyaluronan to tetrasaccharides, did not affect the PDGF-BB-induced cell migration (Fig. 1E). Thus, PDGF-BB-induced dermal fibroblast motility in vitro appeared not to be affected by endogenously produced high molecular weight hyaluronan. Binding of Hyaluronan to CD44 Suppresses PDGF-BB-induced Fibroblast Migration—Given the fact that the hyaluronan amount is high in skin (about 0.5 mg/ml), we investigated the effect of exogenously added hyaluronan on PDGF-BB-induced fibroblast migration. As shown in Fig. 2, the stimulation of cell motility induced by 1 ng/ml PDGF-BB was significantly inhibited by addition of exogenous hyaluronan at 25 μg/ml or higher concentrations of hyaluronan (Fig. 2A). Lower concentrations of exogenously added hyaluronan had no effect on growth factor-stimulated cells (data not shown). To investigate the role of CD44 for the inhibitory effect of hyaluronan on PDGF-BB-induced migration, Hermes-1 monoclonal antibodies that bind to CD44 and block the binding of hyaluronan (31Teder P. Bergh J. Heldin P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3908-3914PubMed Google Scholar) were used. First, we verified that Hermes-1 antibodies could inhibit attachment also of the dermal fibroblasts used in this study to a hyaluronan-coated substratum (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, Fab fragments of anti-CD44 Hermes-1 blocked cell attachment, whereas the nonhyaluronan blocking anti-CD44 Hermes-3 antibodies did not (Fig. 2B). Importantly, addition of Hermes-1 restored the hyaluronan-mediated suppression of PDGF-BB-induced motility of fibroblasts (Fig. 2C; p < 0.05). These results suggest that hyaluronan-CD44 complexes, formed when cells are surrounded with high amounts of hyaluronan, can function as negative modulators of PDGF-BB-mediated cell motility. PDGFRβ Activation Is Inhibited by CD44-Hyaluronan Complexes—To gain insights into the mechanism behind the inhibitory effect of the CD44-hyaluronan complex on PDGF-BB-mediated fibroblast migration, we examined the effect of exogenously added hyaluronan on PDGFRβ activation, in the absence or presence of Hermes-1 (Fig. 3). Interestingly, incubation of PDGF-BB-stimulated fibroblasts with increasing hyaluronan amounts led to a marked decrease of PDGFRβ phosphorylation, achieved at 50 μg/ml and higher concentrations of hyaluronan; densitometric analysis showed that this reduction in the phosphorylation of the PDGFRβ was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Importantly, the presence of Hermes-1 mAbs neutralized the inhibitory effect of hyaluronan on PDGF-BB-induced β-receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 3B; p < 0.05). The presence of Hermes-1 Fab fragments that inhibit the binding of hyaluronan to CD44 (Fig. 2B), but are unable to induce CD44 dimerization, also neutralized the inhibitory effect of hyaluronan on PDGF-BB-induced β-receptor phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 1). These findings suggest that hyaluronan-CD44 complexes inhibit PDGFRβ activation. The effect was specific for hyaluronan because equimolar concentrations of chondroitin sulfate did not inhibit PDGF-BB-induced receptor autophosphorylation (Fig. 3C). PDGFRβ Receptor Forms a Complex with CD44—The hyaluronan-mediated reduction of PDGF-BB-induced β-receptor phosphorylation and its restoration by blocking mAb Hermes-1 suggested a close proximity of PDGFRβ and CD44. Therefore, we examined the possibility that these molecules form a complex by performing co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Immunoprecipitation of PDGFRβ using the CTβ antiserum followed by immunoblotting of CD44 using the Hermes-1 antibody yielded a band of 90-105 kDa, i.e. the expected size of the standard isoform of CD44; no CD44 band was seen when a nonimmune serum was used for precipitation (Fig. 4A). The co-immunoprecipitation of PDGFRβ and CD44 was seen in unstimulated as well as in PDGF-BB-stimulated cells. Re-probing the blot with anti-PDGFRβ antibodies (CTβ) revealed the expected 190-kDa band, and re-probing with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (PY99) revealed that the receptor was phosphorylated and activated after, but not before, PDGF-BB stimulation. When the reverse experiment was done, i.e. immunoprecipitation of CD44 followed by blotting with PDGFRβ antiserum, a band of 190 kDa, i.e. the size of PDGFRβ, was seen with or without PDGF-BB stimulation (Fig. 4B). Re-probing of the blot with Hermes-1 and PY99 antibodies resulted in bands with molecular masses corresponding to CD44 and phosphorylated β-receptor, respectively. Replacement of Hermes-1 with Hermes-3 (another CD44-specific antibody) gave similar results (data not shown). These findings suggest that the PDGFRβ and CD44 form a complex in dermal fibroblasts, before as well as after stimulation with PDGF-BB. Notably, although the PDGFRβ, as expected, was tyrosine-phosphorylated after PDGF-BB stimulation, CD44 was not recognized by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, suggesting that CD44 is not a substrate for the PDGFRβ. We also investigated the localization of CD44 and PDGFRβ receptor in dermal fibroblasts using immunostainings. In unstimulated cells, both CD44 and PDGFRβ were detected diffusely all over the cell with a preference at ruffle structures, where a partial co-localization was observed (Fig. 5A). In PDGF-BB-stimulated cells, the fibroblasts exhibited more ruffles and filopodial extensions, and CD44 was preferentially localized at these ruffle structures, where also the PDGF β-receptors were localized (Fig. 5A). PDGF-BB stimulation induced internalization of β-receptors into endosomes already after 15 min, noticed as dot-like structures; notably, CD44 was not present in these structures, suggesting that CD44 is not internalized together with the PDGF β-receptor. Double staining for hyaluronan and CD44 in PDGF-BB-treated cultures revealed a parxtial co-localization of hyaluronan and CD44 at ruffle- and filopodia-like extensions of the plasma membrane (Fig. 5B). Exogenously added hyaluronan also co-localized partially with CD44 (Fig. 5B); the staining was lost after Streptomyces hyaluronidase digestion (data not shown). Protein-Tyrosine Phosphatase(s) Is Involved in the Hyaluronan-induced Inactivation of PDGFRβ—To investigate whether the hyaluronan-induced inhibition of PDGF β-receptor activation involved dephosphorylation of the receptor, we used the PTP inhibitor pervanadate in fibroblast cultures. As shown in Fig. 6, hyaluronan caused an approximate 40% reduction in the PDGF-BB-stimulated phosphorylation of the β-receptor. Incubation with pervanadate induced an increase in the phosphorylation of β-receptors, and interestingly, in the presence of pervanadate there was no difference between cells incubated with or without hyaluronan. These data suggest that the hyaluronan-CD44-mediated negative regulation of PDGFRβ activation in human dermal fibroblasts involves the recruitment of a PTP to the receptor. We show in this study that hyaluronan inhibits PDGF-BB-induced activation of PDGFRβ and cell motility. The monoclonal antibody Hermes-1, which blocks the binding of hyaluronan to CD44, restored PDGF β-receptor activation and motility, indicating that CD44 mediates the inhibiting effect on PDGFRβ. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PDGFRβ and CD44 form a complex and that the inhibitory effect of hyaluronan is neutralized by inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases. Our data suggest that hyaluronan-activated CD44 modulate PDGFRβ signaling by recruiting tyrosine phosphatase(s) to the receptor. Our finding that PDGFRβ and CD44 are associated into a complex adds to the examples of interactions between PDGFRβ and receptors for matrix molecules. Thus, PDGFRβ has been shown previously to interact with the integrin αvβ3 (26Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 27Woodard A.S. Garcia-Cardena G. Leong M. Madri J.A. Sessa W.C. Languino L.R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 469-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the interaction with αvβ3 enhances PDGF signaling, whereas the interaction with CD44 suppresses PDGF signaling. An important task for future studies will be to identify the molecular mechanisms whereby CD44 inhibits PDGFRβ. CD44 does not exhibit any intrinsic enzymatic activity, but from earlier studies it has been evident that CD44 interacts with other proteins, both in a hyaluronan-dependent and -independent manner and thereby modulates cellular responses (10Ponta H. Sherman L. Herrlich P.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). For example, fibroblast growth factor signaling is promoted by binding of fibroblast growth factors to heparan sulfate chains in the extracellular part of the CD44v3 isoform, whereby the ligand is presented to the signaling tyrosine kinase receptor (32Sherman L. Wainwright D. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1058-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). CD44 has also been shown to act as a co-receptor for the ErbB family of transmembrane tyrosine kinases (33Bourguignon L.Y. Zhu H. Zhou B. Diedrich F. Singleton P.A. Hung M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48679-48692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 34Wobus M. Rangwala R. Sheyn I. Hennigan R. Coila B. Lower E.E. Yassin R.S. Sherman L.S. Appl. Immunohistochem. Mol. Morphol. 2002; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and for the transforming growth factor-β type I serine/threonine kinase receptor (35Bourguignon L.Y. Singleton P.A. Zhu H. Zhou B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39703-39712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In these cases, CD44 interaction enhances growth factor signaling. We found that hyaluronan-activated CD44 inhibits PDGFβR tyrosine kinase activity and suppressed signaling. Because pervanadate neutralized the inhibitory effect, it is likely that hyaluronan binding to CD44 activates a PTP that acts on the autophosphorylated PDGFRβ. Although several PTPs have been shown to have phosphorylated PDGFRβ as substrate (25Persson C. Savenhed C. Bourdeau A. Tremblay M.L. Markova B. Bohmer F.D. Haj F.G. Neel B.G. Elson A. Heldin C.H. Ronnstrand L. Ostman A. Hellberg C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2190-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the PTP(s) involved in CD44-mediated PDGFRβ dephosphorylation has not been identified. Interestingly, the C termini of CD44 possess potential PDZ domain-binding sites (36Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar); it is an interesting possibility that CD44 interacts with PDZ domaincontaining protein phosphatases (37Saras J. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Gonez L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24082-24089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Bass M.D. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Notably, the PTP CD45, which dephosphorylates Lck and Fyn and other members in the Src family of tyrosine kinases, has been shown to have a negative regulatory role in CD44- and α5β1 integrinmediated cell adhesion (39Shenoi H. Seavitt J. Zheleznyak A. Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7120-7127PubMed Google Scholar, 40Li R. Wong N. Jabali M.D. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28767-28773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The concentrations of hyaluronan needed to obtain the negative effects on PDGFRβ activation were rather high, i.e. > 25 μg/ml. However, the concentration of hyaluronan in normal skin has been estimated to be 0.5 mg/ml, suggesting that the modulating effects of hyaluronan on PDGF signaling that we have demonstrated may have physiological relevance. The effect of hyaluronan on PDGF signaling may also be of relevance in pathophysiological situations, such as wound healing. During wound healing, fibroblasts from the surrounding connective tissue become activated by the action of cytokines and growth factors released by platelets and infiltrating macrophages, and migrate and infiltrate the wound provisional matrix that is composed of fibrin and fibronectin. Inside the wound, fibroblasts synthesize large amounts of hyaluronan (2Heldin P. Laurent T.C. Heldin C.-H. Biochem.

PDGF-BB stimulates hyaluronan synthesis and promotes the assembly of hyaluronan-containing pericellular matrices around mesenchymal cells (1Heldin P. Pertoft H. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The findings of the present study suggest that hyaluronan networks may suppress the activity of PDGF-BB and infiltration of fibroblasts into the provisional matrix before matrix remodeling occurs. Thus, the observations by us and others suggest that growth and motility of cells in tissues are regulated by growth factors and extracellular molecules together in a synergistic as well as antagonistic manner (30Eliceiri B.P.

https://openalex.org/W2142552813,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease affecting preterm neonates, is associated with significant childhood and adult health problems. Histopathologic features of BPD include impaired vascular and distal airway development. We previously showed that activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) by inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins (PHDs) is feasible and that it stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent angiogenesis in vitro. We tested the hypothesis that enhancement of angiogenesis by activation of HIFs improves lung growth and function in prematurely born neonates in vivo. Preterm baboons (125 day+14 day pro re nata O2 model, corresponding to 27 human gestational weeks) were treated for 14 days with intravenous (i.v.) FG-4095, a PHD inhibitor. Notably, 77% of diminished total alveolar surface area in untreated controls was recovered by FG-4095 treatment. Functional significance of the structural changes was indicated by improved oxygenation and lung compliance in FG-4095-treated newborns. Surfactant proteins B and C and saturated phosphatidylcholine were unchanged. Incidence of spontaneous ductus arteriosus closure was increased, likely contributing to lower ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow in FG-4095 group. These findings indicate that HIF stimulation by PHD inhibition ameliorates pathological and physiological consequences of BPD."
https://openalex.org/W2029383635,"It has recently been shown that serglycin is essential for maturation of mast cell secretory granules. However, serglycin is expressed also by other cell types, and in this study we addressed the role of serglycin in macrophages. Adherent cells were prepared from murine peritoneal cell populations and from spleens, and analyzed for proteoglycan synthesis by biosynthetic labeling with [35S]sulfate. Conditioned media from serglycin–/– peritoneal macrophages and adherent spleen cells displayed a 65–80% reduction of 35S-labeled proteoglycans, compared with corresponding material from serglycin+/+ cells, indicating that serglycin is the dominant secretory proteoglycan in macrophages of these origins. In contrast, the levels of intracellular proteoglycans were similar in serglycin+/+ and serglycin–/– cells, suggesting that serglycin is not stored intracellularly to a major extent in macrophages. This is in contrast to mast cells, in which serglycin is predominantly stored intracellularly. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the absence of serglycin did not cause any major morphological effects on peritoneal macrophages, in contrast to dramatic defects in intracellular storage vesicles in peritoneal mast cells. Several secretory products were not found to be affected by the lack of serglycin. However, the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation was markedly higher in serglycin–/– cultures than in those of serglycin+/+. The present report thus demonstrates that serglycin is the major proteoglycan secreted by peritoneal macrophages and suggests that the macrophage serglycin may have a role in regulating secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α.

Uyama T. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). PGs are composed of a protein core to which glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains are attached, and many of the functions of PGs have been ascribed to these chains (5Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Crown S.E. Lau E.K. Proudfoot A.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 385-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). However, several functions have been reported to reside in the protein cores of PGs, as shown e.g. for aggrecan (6Kiani C. Chen L. Wu Y.J. Yee A.J. Yang B.B. Cell Res. 2002; 12: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) and perlecan (7Makatsori E. Lamari F.N. Theocharis A.D. Anagnostides S. Hjerpe A. Tsegenidis T. Karamanos N.K. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 3303-3309PubMed Google Scholar). The GAG chains, either of chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS), heparan sulfate (HS), or heparin type, have been shown to interact with a series of molecules, and to regulate their activities (8Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 9Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). For example, PGs are known to interact with such diverse molecules as mast cell chymases (10Pejler G. Maccarana M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14451-14456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), antithrombin (11Princivalle M. Hasan S. Hosseini G. de Agostini A.I.

Life Sci. 1999; 56: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and fibroblast growth factor (14Vlodavsky I. Miao H.Q. Medalion B. Danagher P. Ron D. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). PGs in intracellular granules and vesicles are receiving increasing attention (2Kolset S.O. Prydz K. Pejler G. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Studies in which the gene coding for N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-2 (NDST-2), an important enzyme in HS/heparin biosynthesis, was targeted, showed that the lack of heparin in mast cells led to generation of storage granules without heparin and that the lack of heparin caused major defects in the storage of other granule constituents, such as proteases and histamine (15Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellen L. Nature. 1999; 400: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 16Humphries D.E. Wong G.W. Friend D.S. Gurish M.F. Qiu W.T. Huang C. Sharpe A.H. Stevens R.L. Nature. 1999; 400: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The heparin chains in mast cell secretory granules have commonly been thought to be attached to the serglycin (SG) core protein and, indeed, the recent targeting of the SG gene resulted in similar defects in mast cell granule storage as those observed after the knock-out of NDST-2 (17Abrink M. Grujic M. Pejler G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40897-40905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Together, these data provide strong support for an essential role of SG in mediating storage of mast cell secretory granule compounds. However, SG expression has been detected in a multitude of cells other than mast cells (reviewed in Ref. 2Kolset S.O. Prydz K. Pejler G. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), e.g. macrophages, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and neutrophils. In a recent report it was shown that CTLs from serglycin knock-out (SG–/–) mice displayed defects in the storage of granzyme B along with morphological defects of the lytic granule, although storage of several other granule constituents were not affected (18Grujic M. Braga T. Lukinius A. Eloranta M.L. Knight S.D. Pejler G. Abrink M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33411-33418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study we specifically addressed the role of SG in macrophages. Our results show that macrophage SG, in contrast to SG in mast cells and CTLs, is predominantly secreted, and that it may have a role in regulating the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Animals—Wild type, SG–/–, and NDST-2 knock-out (NDST-2–/–) mice on C57BL/6J genetic background were as described previously (15Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B.

Chem. 2004; 279: 40897-40905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In some experiments SG heterozygote (SG+/–) mice were also used. Age-matched littermates (8–12 weeks) of both genders were used in all experiments, but the same gender was used consistently within each experiment. Animals were maintained according to the guidelines established by the Swedish National Board for Laboratory Animals, and all experiments were approved by the local ethical committee. Isolation and Culture of Peritoneal Macrophages—Mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and resident peritoneal cells were isolated by washing the peritoneal cavities with cold PBS (one mouse yielded 2–3 × 106 viable peritoneal cells). Isolated cells were washed three times in PBS by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. The cells were seeded at either 1 × 106 cells/500 μl of culture medium in 24-well plates, 1 × 106 cells/ml culture medium in 6-well plates, or 8 × 106 cells/10 ml of culture medium in 9-cm Petri dishes, and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After incubation for 2 h, non-adherent cells were removed by washing with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS three times. Peritoneal macrophages were obtained at a purity of greater than 95% by this procedure (19Uhlin-Hansen L. Eskeland T. Kolset S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14916-14922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Uhlin-Hansen L. Wik T. Kjellen L. Berg E. Forsdahl F. Kolset S.O. Blood. 1993; 82: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adherent cells were cultured further in the serum-free medium specified above, unless otherwise stated. In some experiments, peritoneal cells were depleted from mast cells by density gradient centrifugation on metrizamide (21Sterk A.R. Ishizaka T. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 838-843PubMed Google Scholar), followed by culturing of mast cell-depleted peritoneal cells as well as mast cell-depleted peritoneal cells reconstituted with purified mast cells. Isolation and Culture of Spleen Cells—Spleens were aseptically removed and placed in Petri dishes containing 5 ml of cold PBS. The spleens were then cut in pieces and the spleen cells were recovered using the plunger of a 10-ml syringe. Red blood cells were lysed for 5 min at room temperature in a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3, and 0.1 mm Na2EDTA (pH 7.4). Cells were washed three times in PBS by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in the same culture medium as was used for peritoneal macrophages. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. One spleen yielded 6–9 × 107 viable cells. The cells were seeded at a concentration 4 × 106 cells/500 μl culture medium in 24-well plates or 1 × 107 cells/10 ml of culture medium in 9-cm Petri dishes and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After incubation for 2 h, non-adherent cells were removed by washing with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS three times followed by the addition of fresh culture medium. 35S Labeling of Macromolecules—For radiolabeling of macromolecules, adherent cells were cultured in sulfate-free RPMI 1640 culture medium (Invitrogen), with 2 mm l-glutamine added, and exposed to [35S]sulfate (50 μCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) for 24 h. PG Analyses—Conditioned media and cell fractions from peritoneal macrophages and adherent spleen cells were collected, and purified using DEAE Sephacel anion exchange chromatography (Amersham Biosciences), as previously described (17Abrink M. Grujic M. Pejler G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40897-40905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The fractions were analyzed for 35S radioactivity using liquid scintillation counting. Fractions containing radioactivity were pooled, and low molecular [35S]sulfate substances and free [35S]sulfate were removed using PD-10 desalting columns (Amersham Biosciences). After desalting, aliquots of the samples were analyzed for 35S radioactivity. Portions of the samples were further treated with papain, as previously described (17Abrink M. Grujic M. Pejler G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40897-40905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). After desalting, the samples were concentrated using a SpeedVac system. Samples of isolated [35S]sulfate-labeled GAGs from conditioned medium (∼10,000 cpm) and from cell fractions (∼7000 cpm) were mixed with 0.5 mg each of unlabeled internal standards of CS-A and pig mucosal heparin, and applied to a 1-ml DEAE Sephacel anion exchange column connected to a HPLC system, as previously described (17Abrink M. Grujic M. Pejler G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40897-40905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The samples were eluted using a linear LiCl gradient (50 mm to 2 m). Collected fractions were analyzed for 35S radioactivity and for uronic acid content using the carbazole reaction (22Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5205) Google Scholar) to detect the internal standards. GAGs released from the PG protein cores (∼10,000 cpm), using either NaOH (23Cheung W.F. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindhal U. Kjellen L. Biochemistry (Mosc). 1996; 35: 5250-5256Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or papain, were subjected to HNO2 (pH 1.5) or chondroitinase ABC (cABC) treatment, as previously described (24Svennevig K. Prydz K. Kolset S.O. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). cABC (from Proteus vulgaris) was purchased from Seikagaku Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). The amounts of HS and CS were calculated from the proportions of degradation products by gel chromatography on Superose 6 after HNO2 or cABC treatment, respectively. To analyze macromolecular properties of the macrophage PGs, aliquots of the [35S]PGs were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography, before and after treatment with NaOH or papain. Samples (∼7000 cpm) were analyzed by Superose 6 gel chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) using 1 m NaCl as mobile phase. The elution profiles were monitored by liquid scintillation counting of eluted fractions. Pulse-Chase Experiments—Peritoneal macrophages were cultured at a density of 5 × 105 cells/500 μl of sulfate-free RPMI 1640 culture medium, with 2 mm l-glutamine added, and exposed to 500 μCi/ml of [35S]sulfate for 30 min. The cells were then washed five times with culture medium to remove free [35S]sulfate. Thereafter the cells were chased for 30 min to 24 h in RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Conditioned media were collected, and loose cells were separated from the media by centrifugation at 350 × g for 3 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed in 1 m NaCl and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. All cell fractions and conditioned media were analyzed by Superose 6 gel chromatography using 1 m NaCl and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 as mobile phase. Some samples were subjected to NaOH treatment to release the GAGs from the PG protein cores. The elution profiles were monitored by liquid scintillation counting of eluted fractions. Lysozyme Analyses—Lysozyme activity was measured using a turbidimetric assay based on the ability of lysozyme to disrupt the cell wall of the bacterium Micrococcus lysodeikticus. Peritoneal macrophages were cultured in vitro in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Eschericha coli serotype 055:B5 (Sigma). Conditioned medium was harvested after 24 h incubation, and loose cells were separated from the medium by centrifugation at 350 × g for 3 min. Next, 50 μl of the medium was added to a mixture of 125 μl of PBS (pH 6.2) and 25 μl of a M. lysodeikticus suspension (20 mg/ml in PBS, pH 6.2) in microtiter plate wells and incubated at 37 °C with gentle agitation. Lysis of the bacteria leads to a decrease in absorbance at 595 nm, which was measured at different time points. Matrix Metalloproteinase Analyses—The possible presence of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities was investigated using gelatin zymography. Briefly, conditioned media were separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin (type A, from porcine skin, Sigma). After electrophoresis, gels were washed with 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and further incubated overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 5mm CaCl2, and 0.02% (w/v) Brij 35 (Sigma), followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Positive controls of MMP-2 (25Loennechen T. Mathisen B. Hansen J. Lindstad R.I. El Gewely S.A. Andersen K. Maelandsmo G.M. Winberg J.O. Biochem.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 3996-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were run with each gel. Cytokine Analyses—Peritoneal macrophages and adherent spleen cells were cultured in vitro in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml LPS. Conditioned media were collected after 1, 4, and 24 h incubation, and loose cells were separated from the media by centrifugation at 350 × g for 3 min. Macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α), interleukin-1α (IL-1α), and TNF-α levels in conditioned media were assessed by ELISA (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK), as described by the manufacturer. TNF-α levels were also determined in cell fractions from peritoneal macrophages. In some experiments cells were incubated in the presence of 20 nm of the TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) inhibitor TIMP-3 (Sigma). Cells were washed three times with PBS and further lysed in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate (Sigma), 0.1% (w/v) SDS and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatants were collected and subjected to TNF-α analysis. Transmission Electron Microscopy of Peritoneal Cells—Peritoneal cells from SG+/– and SG–/– mice were fixed for 6 h in 2% glutaraldehyde in a 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer supplemented with 0.1 m sucrose, followed by 1.5 h of postfixation in 1% osmium tetroxide dissolved in the same cacodylate buffer. After dehydration in ethanol, the cells were embedded in the epoxy resin Agar 100 (Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK). Ultrathin sections were placed on copper grids covered with a film of polyvinyl formal plastic (Formvar, Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK) and contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Electron micrographs were taken with a Hitachi electron microscope (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Statistical Analyses—Statistical significance was tested using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). When more than two groups were compared, a Tamhane's T2 post hoc test was performed for all groups. The significance level was set to 5%, and all analyses were performed using SPSS 12. PGs—Peritoneal macrophages and adherent spleen cells were obtained from SG+/+ and SG–/– mice. Both cell types were cultured in vitro and incubated with [35S]sulfate for 24 h to label PGs. It has previously been established that [35S]sulfate is incorporated almost exclusively into PGs in peritoneal macrophages (29Kolset S.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Labeled [35S]PGs were purified both from the conditioned media and the cell layers. Quantification of the labeled PGs recovered from the respective pools showed that most of the incorporated radioactivity of SG+/+ peritoneal macrophages and adherent spleen cells was in the medium fractions, indicating that a majority of the macrophage PGs are destined for secretion rather than to cell-associated compartments (Table 1, Experiment 1). The absence of SG did not cause any significant effect on the amount of PGs recovered from the cell layers, indicating that intracellular and cell surface-associated PGs in macrophages are mainly of non-SG nature, for example syndecan-1, syndecan-4, and versican (7Makatsori E. Lamari F.N. Theocharis A.D. Anagnostides S. Hjerpe A. Tsegenidis T. Karamanos N.K. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 3303-3309PubMed Google Scholar, 30Yeaman C. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, the absence of SG caused a major reduction (∼65–80%) in the amount of [35S]sulfate-labeled PGs recovered from conditioned media, both from peritoneal macrophages and adherent spleen cells (Table 1). The latter findings clearly suggest that SG constitutes the dominating PG species that is secreted by macrophages. The effect of the SG knock-out on the amount of secreted PGs was reproduced in independent experiments, although the total amount of incorporated radioactivity showed some variation between the different experiments (Table 1).TABLE 1Comparison of incorporation of [35S]sulfate into GAGs of in vitro cultured peritoneal macrophages and adherent spleen cells from SG+/+ and SG–/– miceSource of [35S]sulfate-labeled GAGsSG+/+SG-/-Ratio SG+/+/SG-/-cpm/106 cellsPeritoneal macrophagesExperiment 1aPapain-treated material.Medium fraction104,00023,0004.5Cell fraction9,0009,0001.0Experiment 2bNaOH-treated material.Medium fraction320,000110,0002.9Adherent spleen cellsExperiment 1aPapain-treated material.Medium fraction5,500 ± 1,200cAverage value of three individual mice ± S.D.1,400 ± 100cAverage value of three individual mice ± S.D.3.6Cell fraction600 ± 200cAverage value of three individual mice ± S.D.500 ± 150cAverage value of three individual mice ± S.D.1.2Experiment 2bNaOH-treated material.Medium fraction6,0002,0003.0a Papain-treated material.b NaOH-treated material.c Average value of three individual mice ± S.D. Open table in a new tab To address whether the absence of SG affects the type of GAG chains expressed, [35S]GAGs from peritoneal macrophages were subjected to HNO2 treatment to degrade HS and cABC to depolymerize CS, followed by gel chromatography on Superose 6 to quantify the degradation products produced by the respective treatments (Table 2). These analyses showed that ∼50% of the GAGs secreted by peritoneal macrophages from SG+/+ mice were HS, with the remainder being CS. In contrast, the HS content of the PGs secreted by SG–/– cells was lower, with only ∼25–40% of the GAGs being HS. Thus, there appears to be a preference of HS to attach to the SG core protein in murine macrophages.TABLE 2Comparison of amounts of HS and CS in conditioned media from in vitro cultured peritoneal macrophages from SG+/+ and SG–/– miceGAG typeSG+/+SG-/-%Experiment 1aPapain-treated material.HS5326CS4573Experiment 2bNaOH-treated material.HS5239CS5259a Papain-treated material.b NaOH-treated material. Open table in a new tab To analyze if the targeting of SG would affect the polyanionic properties of [35S]GAGs from peritoneal macrophages, medium and cell derived GAGs (after papain treatment) were analyzed by DEAE anion exchange chromatography together with internal standards of CS and heparin. As shown in Fig. 1, [35S]GAGs derived from conditioned medium of both SG+/+ and SG–/– macrophages eluted before the internal CS standard, indicating a relatively low anionic charge density, whereas the cell-derived [35S]GAGs were eluted later in the salt gradient. However, there was no difference in elution profiles between material from SG+/+ and SG–/– mice, suggesting that GAGs attached to the SG core protein had similar polyanionic properties as those attached to non-SG species. To analyze the macromolecular properties of the macrophage PGs, intact PGs were analyzed by Superose 6 chromatography. In addition, PGs were analyzed after liberating the GAG chains by treatment with NaOH. As shown in Fig. 2A, there were marked differences in the elution profiles of 35S-labeled PGs from SG+/+ and SG–/– mice. A major portion of the PGs secreted by SG+/+ macrophages eluted at Kav ∼0.3. The corresponding peak in the material from SG–/– cells was markedly lower; instead a major peak at Kav ∼0.75 was observed. After NaOH treatment essentially all of the material both from SG+/+ and SG–/– cells eluted with peaks at closely similar Kav values (∼0.75), indicating that the latter elution positions corresponded to free GAG chains and that the GAG chains attached to SG and to other PG species had approximately the same chain length (Fig. 2B). Hence, a major portion of the 35S-labeled material released by SG–/– cells corresponded to free GAG chains. Papain digestion of PGs derived from SG–/– cells also gave an essentially complete conversion of the intact PGs into material eluting at the position of free GAG chains, indicating that the non-SG species secreted by the macrophages were sensitive to protease treatment (Fig. 2C). In contrast, a major part of the PGs secreted by SG+/+ cells was resistant to papain, a property that previously has been ascribed also to SG purified from mast cells (31Yurt R.W. Leid Jr., R.W. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 518-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is evident from Fig. 2B that the liberated GAG chains from SG+/+ and SG–/– cells eluted at similar positions on the Superose 6 column, indicating that the GAGs attached to SG and to other PG species had approximately the same chain length. To follow synthesis and secretion of PGs, we performed pulsechase experiments. As depicted in Fig. 3, A and B, two cell-associated populations of 35S-labeled PGs were recovered both from SG+/– and SG–/– cells, with one PG population eluting at Kav ∼0.2 and one eluting at Kav ∼0.4. It is also apparent that the SG+/– cells contained proportionally higher levels of the Kav ∼0.4 PG than the SG–/– cells. This strongly suggests that SG is eluting at the Kav ∼0.4 position and that the Kav ∼0.2 peak mostly contains PGs of non-SG species. During the chase period it was further evident that the Kav ∼0.4 PG component was released to the medium to a much larger extent by cells from SG+/– mice (Fig. 3C) than by corresponding cells from SG–/– mice (Fig. 3D). Again, these results are in agreement with SG being a major secretory PG in peritoneal macrophages. Effect of the SG Knock-out on Secretion—Macrophages have previously been shown to secrete a multitude of compounds in response to inflammatory stimuli (32Nathan C.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 79: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar), and many of these products have been shown to interact with SG (33Kolset S.O. Mann D.M. Uhlin-Hansen L. Winberg J.O. Ruoslahti E. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1996; 59: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Further experiments were therefore performed to investigate if the absence of SG would affect secretion of such molecules. Peritoneal macrophages from SG+/+, SG+/–, and SG–/– mice were cultured in vitro in the absence or presence of LPS (1 μg/ml), a commonly used reagent to trigger cytokine release by macrophages (34Cavaillon J.M. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1994; 48: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 35Uhlin-Hansen L. Kolset S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2526-2531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conditioned media were recovered and subjected to further analyses. First, the level of secreted lysozyme was investigated. As shown in Fig. 4A, it is clear that the peritoneal macrophages secreted lysozyme and that the level of lysozyme was actually decreased after LPS stimulation (Fig. 4B), the latter being in agreement with previous reports (36Ohno N. Takada K. Kurasawa T. Liang A. Yadomae T. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1998; 397: 179-190PubMed Google Scholar, 37Warfel A.H. Zucker-Franklin D. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 651-655PubMed Google Scholar). However, the level of activity was not influenced by the absence of SG, indicating that lysozyme secretion is not SG-dependent. Conditioned media were also analyzed for the presence of MMPs, in particular MMP-2 and MMP-9, by gelatin zymography. Although MMP-9 was detected in the conditioned media, no consistent differences in levels or degree of activation of MMP-9 were seen between SG+/+ and SG–/– cultures (Fig. 4, C and D). In a series of expe"
https://openalex.org/W2074865940,"Intracellular cell signaling cascades of protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum are not clearly understood. We have reported previously (Kumar, A., Vaid, A., Syin, C., and Sharma, P. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 24255-24264) the identification and characterization of a protein kinase B-like enzyme in P. falciparum (PfPKB). PfPKB lacks the phosphoinositide-interacting pleckstrin homology domain present in mammalian protein kinase B. Therefore, the mechanism of PfPKB regulation was expected to be different from that of the host and had remained unknown. We have identified calmodulin (CaM) as the regulator of PfPKB activity. A CaM binding domain was mapped in the N-terminal region of PfPKB. CaM, in a calcium-dependent manner, interacts with this domain and activates PfPKB. CaM associates with PfPKB in the parasite and regulates its activity. Furthermore phospholipase C acts as an upstream regulator of this cascade as it facilitates the release of calcium from intracellular stores. This is one of the first multicomponent signaling pathways to be dissected in the malaria parasite."
https://openalex.org/W1998997668,"Lipid mediators such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) play a central role during atherogenesis as a consequence of inflammation. PGE2 is produced from phospholipids by a cascade of enzymatic reactions involving phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX), and prostaglandin E synthase (PGES). It is released by several cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Recent work has shown that the secretory PLA2-IIA (sPLA2-IIA), the most abundant isoform of secreted PLA2 in VSMCs, acts as a potent cytokine and activates VSMCs through a positive feedback loop. High mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1), also known as amphoterin, is a ubiquitous protein that plays various roles in the nucleus. HMGB1 is released by necrotic cells and by immune cells in response to various inflammatory mediators and acts as a potent proinflammatory cytokine. The present study investigates the role of HMGB1 in the activation of sPLA2-IIA expression and PGE2 production in VSMCs. Recombinant HMGB1 slightly activated the sPLA2-IIA, COX-2, and mPGES-1 genes but dramatically stimulated these genes in VSMCs that had been incubated with the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta for 24 h. This effect was accompanied by significantly increased PGE2 release. Induction of the three known receptors of HMGB1, namely RAGE, TLR-2, and TLR-4, by IL-1beta suggests that proinflammatory cytokines sensitize VSMCs to HMGB1. This provides new insights into the role of HMGB1 in VSMCs, suggesting it may be essential for the progression of atherosclerosis."

Whiteley H.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 242-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once an organism has ingested a parasporal Cry protein in B. thuringiensis, the protein is solubilized under alkaline conditions in the midgut and processed to an active toxin by digestive system proteases. The activated toxin then binds to a specific receptor on the membrane surface of epithelial gut cells, leading to permeable pore formation and finally the death of the insect (2Schnepf E.

Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 193-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Because of their nonpathogenicity toward vertebrate organisms and species-specific toxicities toward insects, Cry proteins have been applied world-wide as biopesticides, and some Cry protein genes are now used in transgenic crops to control insect pests (4Cannon R.J.C. Biol. Rev. 1996; 71: 561-636Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). On the other hand, these toxins are not only important tools for organic farming but have also made important contributions to the control of insect-mediated diseases, such as African river blindness. Recently, Cry proteins have also been shown to target nematodes, including the intestinal parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (5Wei J.Z. Hale K. Carta L. Platzer E. Wong C. Fang S.C. Aroian R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and to kill pathogenic protozoan parasites, including Trichomonas vaginalis (6Kondo S. Mizuki E. Akao T. Ohba M. Parasitol. Res. 2002; 88: 1090-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidating the molecular actions of antiparasitic Cry proteins may be useful for controlling parasites in medical fields.The genes for the B. thuringiensis Cry proteins appear to reside on plasmids, often as a part of composite structures that include a variety of transportable elements (3de Maagd R.A. Bravo A. Crickmore N. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 193-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 7Mahillon J. Rezsohazy R. Hallet B. Delcour J. Genetica (Dordr.). 1994; 93: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This high degree of genetic plasticity results in a remarkable diversity of B. thuringiensis strains and Cry proteins, and a growing number of these strains and toxin proteins are being isolated and cloned (2Schnepf E. Crickmore N. Van Rie J. Lereclus D. Baum J. Feitelson J. Zeigler D.R. Dean D.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 775-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Crickmore N. Zeigler D.R. Feitelson J. Schnepf E. Van Rie J. Lereclus D. Baum J. Dean D.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 807-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a number of B. thuringiensis strains producing insecticidal toxins have been identified, many other B. thuringiensis strains containing noninsecticidal inclusion proteins have also been ubiquitously discovered in natural environments and are rather more widely distributed than the insecticidal strains (9Ohba M. Aizawa K. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1986; 47: 12-20Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 10Meadows M.P. Ellis D.J. Butt J. Jarrett P. Burges H.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 1344-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Through a wide screening of noninsecticidal Cry protein cytotoxicities toward several human cell lines, we have identified novel B. thuringiensis toxins, the parasporins, that possess cytotoxic and nonhemolytic activities against a wide range of human cells (11Mizuki E. Ohba M. Akao T. Yamashita S. Saitoh H. Park Y.S. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1999; 86: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12Mizuki E. Park Y.S. Saitoh H. Yamashita S. Akao T. Higuchi K. Ohba M. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 2000; 7: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The parasporins are heterogeneous in their cytotoxicity spectra, because some are active on human cells, whereas others kill a few specific cells.A potent toxin was discovered in the noninsecticidal and nonhemolytic B. thuringiensis strain A1547, which produces agglutinative Cry proteins with cytocidal activity against MOLT-4 human leukemic T cells (13Kim H.S. Yamashita S. Akao T. Saitoh H. Higuchi K. Park Y.S. Mizuki E. Ohba M. J. Appl. Microbiol. 2000; 89: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we obtained the gene encoding the purified new toxin protein, which was named parasporin-2 (or Cry31Aa, as designated by the B. thuringiensis δ-endotoxin nomenclature committee) (14Katayama H. Yokota H. Akao T. Nakamura O. Ohba M. Mekada E. Mizuki E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and we examined the cytotoxic activities of a recombinant parasporin-2 against a variety of cultured human cells. Parasporin-2 was found to have strong cytocidal activities against various human cells with markedly divergent target specificities. For example, it was highly cytotoxic toward human hepatocyte cancer cells (HepG2 cells) and less cytotoxic toward normal hepatocyte cells (HC cells) (15Ito A. Sasaguri Y. Kitada S. Kusaka Y. Kuwano K. Masutomi K. Mizuki E. Akao T. Ohba M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21282-21286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In slices of liver and colon cancer tissues, it was surprisingly found that parasporin-2 preferentially killed the cancer cells, while leaving the normal cells unaffected (15Ito A. Sasaguri Y. Kitada S. Kusaka Y. Kuwano K. Masutomi K. Mizuki E. Akao T. Ohba M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21282-21286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Because parasporin-2 possesses highly selective cytotoxicity toward human cells, and especially has the potential to recognize and kill some classes of cancer cells, the possibility of its application to medical and biological fields has been anticipated (15Ito A. Sasaguri Y. Kitada S. Kusaka Y. Kuwano K. Masutomi K. Mizuki E. Akao T. Ohba M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21282-21286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the actions of parasporin-2 have hardly been characterized at the molecular and cellular levels. For instance, the active form of parasporin-2 and its exact mechanism for inducing cell death are currently unknown. Through our present analyses of its proteolytic activation and cytocidal effects, we show the following: (i) that parasporin-2 is highly activated through processing of both its N- and C-terminal propeptides; (ii) that it specifically binds to the plasma membrane of hepatocyte cancer cells; (iii) that it rapidly increases the membrane permeability; and (iv) that it dramatically alters the cytoskeleton and organelle morphologies. Thus, parasporin-2 is a cell-discriminating, membrane-targeting, and pore-inducing toxin that subsequently causes irreversible intracellular decay in cancer cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Materials—HepG2 and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM; Nissui) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Biological Industries), whereas HeLa cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Nissui) containing 10% FCS, under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The polyclonal antibody against parasporin-2 was raised in rabbits against the purified protein. The monoclonal antibodies against α-tubulin and cadherin were purchased from ICN Biomedicals and Sigma, respectively. The anti-GAPDH and anticytochrome c monoclonal antibodies were obtained from HyTest and Zymed Laboratories Inc., respectively. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PDI and actin were purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. and Sigma, respectively. Tom40 and cytochrome P450 reductase polyclonal antibodies were gifts from Dr. K. Mihara (Kyushu University) and Dr. T. Ogishima (Kyushu University), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from BIOSOURCE.Purification of Recombinant Parasporin-2—Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with the pET-37k plasmid, containing a gene for full-length parasporin-2 and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag, were cultured and lysed as described previously (15Ito A. Sasaguri Y. Kitada S. Kusaka Y. Kuwano K. Masutomi K. Mizuki E. Akao T. Ohba M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21282-21286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Following centrifugation, the material in the pellet was solubilized in 50 mm Na2CO3 at 37 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g. The resultant supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with an alkaline solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm Na2CO3) and eluted with 50 mm Na2CO3 and 500 mm imidazole. The purified protein was digested with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 30 min and then 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to stop the proteolysis. The protease-treated protein was applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the alkaline solution, and the protease-resistant 30-kDa parasporin-2 toxin was eluted with 500 mm NaCl. The 31-kDa toxin, a truncated protein lacking the N-terminal 51 residues, with an N-terminal initial methionine and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag was produced and purified as described previously (15Ito A. Sasaguri Y. Kitada S. Kusaka Y. Kuwano K. Masutomi K. Mizuki E. Akao T. Ohba M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21282-21286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—Proteinase K-treated parasporin-2 was mixed with a matrix solution of sinapinic acid as described previously (16Okumura S. Saitoh H. Ishikawa T. Wasano N. Yamashita S. Kusumoto K. Akao T. Mizuki E. Ohba M. Inouye K. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2005; 53: 6313-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the mixture was analyzed using an Autoflex mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). The spectrometer was calibrated using ubiquitin, myoglobin, trypsinogen, and bovine serum albumin as molecular weight standards.Determination of Cell Viability—Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well and cultured overnight, before parasporin-2 was added to each well. To determine the LD50 (LD50) of the toxin for each cell type, the viable cells were measured by the MTT assay using a Cell Titer 96™ nonradioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega) after intoxication at 37 °C for 24 h as described previously (15Ito A. Sasaguri Y. Kitada S. Kusaka Y. Kuwano K. Masutomi K. Mizuki E. Akao T. Ohba M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21282-21286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). When a kinetic analysis was performed for the cell death, we determined the cell viability by quantification of ATP, which indicates the presence of metabolically active cells, using a CellTiter-Glo™ luminescent cell viability assay kit (Promega). The chemiluminescence signals were captured with a cooled CCD camera system (Cool Saver; ATTO), and their intensities were quantified using image analysis software (CSAnalyzer; ATTO).Protein Efflux and PI Influx Measurements—Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well and cultured overnight. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), parasporin-2 was added to the cells in DMEM without FCS. For determination of LDH efflux from the cells, the medium was centrifuged to remove floating cells. Next, the resultant supernatant was mixed with the solution of the LDH cytotoxicity detection kit (Takara), and the optical densities at 490 nm were measured with a microplate reader model 550 (Bio-Rad). To inhibit the LDH efflux, 30 mm PEG (Wako) in DMEM was added to the cells followed by treatment with parasporin-2 for 8 h. The amounts of leaked LDH were determined and represented as percentages of the LDH activity obtained after treatment of the cells with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. For PI (Sigma) staining, cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were grown on 96-well plates overnight and washed twice with PBS, before PI (final concentration: 5 mg/ml) in DMEM was added together with parasporin-2. At the indicated times, the uptake of PI into the cells was measured with a FLA-5000 Phosphor-Imager (Fuji Film) with excitation at 510 nm and emission at 665 nm. 100% entry of PI was determined by treatment of the cells with 0.2% Triton X-100.Measurement of the Membrane Potential—HepG2 cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were grown overnight on Optilux 96-well clear-bottom plates (Falcon) precoated with collagen type I (Sigma). The cells were washed twice with a dye solution (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 1 mm bis(1,3-dibarbituric acid)-trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3)) (Dojin)), and then incubated in the dye solution at 37 °C for 30 min. The fluorescence intensities of the dye, which depended on the membrane potential, were monitored using a Flex Station (Molecular Devices) with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 520 nm. After the fluorescence intensity had stabilized, parasporin-2 was added. Maximal depolarization was obtained at the end of each experiment by adding valinomycin (final concentration, 10 μm). Single fluorescence traces were expressed as the ratio I(t)/Imax, i.e. fluorescence intensity relative to the maximal fluorescence intensity after the addition of valinomycin.Electron Microscopy—After MOLT-4 cells had been incubated with parasporin-2 at 37 °C for appropriate times, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultrathin sections were prepared as described previously (17Lee D. Katayama H. Akao T. Maeda M. Tanaka R. Yamashita S. Saitoh H. Mizuki E. Ohba M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and observed using an electron microscope (model H-7100; Hitachi).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on collagen I-coated chamber slides. The cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells/chamber and incubated overnight. After washing with PBS, parasporin-2 was added to the cells in DMEM without FCS, and the cells were incubated for appropriate times. Immunofluorescence experiments were performed as described previously (18Mitoma J. Ito A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed several times with PBS, and treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 2 min to permeabilize the membranes. Excess aldehyde was quenched by incubation with 1 mg/ml NaBH4 for 10 min. The intoxicated, fixed, and permeabilized cells were treated with an anti-parasporin-2 antibody as the primary antibody, and then labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) as a fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibody, in PBS containing 10 mm glycine and 10% bovine serum albumin. For double immunostaining, Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat antimouse IgG was also used as a secondary antibody.Immunohistochemistry of Tissue Samples—For immunohistochemical observation of parasporin-2 in liver and colon cancer tissues, cancer specimens were cut into small pieces and incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS and 100 nm parasporin-2 for 24 h in 37 °C at an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2, before being fixed in 10% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin (19Sasaguri Y. Komiya S. Sugama K. Suzuki K. Inoue A. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 611-621PubMed Google Scholar). After deparaffinization and rehydration, 5-mm sections were incubated in 3% H2O2 for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Next, the sections were rinsed and incubated with a polyclonal anti-parasporin-2 antibody for 1 h. After washing with PBS, secondary antibody/peroxidase-linked polymers were applied, and the sections were incubated with 100 ml of Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 20 mg of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, 65 mg of sodium azide, and 20 ml of 30% H2O2. After counterstaining with Meyer's hematoxylin, the sections were observed under a light microscope. The diagnosis of each cancer tissue specimen was re-evaluated and confirmed by three pathologists who examined formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin or appropriate immunohistochemical stains.RESULTSProparasporin-2 Is Cleaved to a 30-kDa Core Fragment by Proteinase K—Digestion of Cry protein precursors by digestive system proteases in the insect midgut or in vitro is essential for toxin activation. The protein inclusion of parasporin-2 can also be activated in vitro by proteolysis under alkaline conditions. We previously reported the possibility that parasporin-2 undergoes N-terminal processing, because of differences between the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the predicted protein from the nucleotide sequence of the gene and the protease-activated native toxin (15Ito A. Sasaguri Y. Kitada S. Kusaka Y. Kuwano K. Masutomi K. Mizuki E. Akao T. Ohba M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21282-21286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The protein sequence of the activated native toxin started with an aspartic acid that represented residue 52 of the full-length toxin (proparasporin-2). To examine the exact molecular form of the active toxin, recombinant proparasporin-2 and a truncated toxin lacking the N-terminal 51 residues, each with a His6 tag at the C terminus, were expressed in E. coli and purified on a nickel-chelating column. When the purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained, almost homogeneous polypeptides for proparasporin-2 (37 kDa) and the N-terminal truncate (31 kDa) were detected (Fig. 1A). After treating the recombinant parasporin-2 with proteinase K, the molecular sizes of the processed proteins were essentially the same as that of native parasporin-2 in the gel (Fig. 1B). The migration of the N-terminally truncated parasporin-2 was slower than the proteinase K-activated parasporin-2 (30 kDa) obtained from parasporal inclusion bodies of B. thuringiensis strain A1547 or the recombinant protein (Fig. 1B, compare lane 3 with lanes 2 and 6). The observed differences in the protein sizes were not because of the C-terminal His6 tag addition, because the N-terminally truncated parasporin-2 without a His6 tag was also larger than the mature 30-kDa toxin (Fig. 1C, upper panel). No His6 tag epitope was detected in the 30-kDa toxin using a monoclonal antibody against polyhistidine (Fig. 1C, lower panel). Therefore, the differences appear to result from cleavage at the C-terminal region. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of the molecular masses of the 30-kDa proteins obtained from native and recombinant sources revealed that the proteins were essentially the same size, specifically 27,869.9 and 27,873.3 Da for the native and recombinant proteins, respectively. The N-terminal protein sequence of the recombinant 30-kDa toxin was DVIRE, which was the same sequence obtained in our previous report using the activated native toxin (15Ito A. Sasaguri Y. Kitada S.

These mass values and protein sequences are consistent with the value of 27,855.5 Da calculated for the toxin sequence corresponding to amino acid residues 52-306. Thus, parasporin-2 is cleaved by proteinase K not only at the N terminus but also at the C terminus, and the resultant product is a 30-kDa core toxin, as illustrated in Fig. 1D.C-terminal Processing Enables Parasporin-2 to Convert to the Potent Toxin—To elucidate the effect of the C-terminal cleavage on the cytocidal activity, the N- and C-terminally processed parasporin-2 (30 kDa) was tested for its cytotoxicity toward various human cells. When the cytotoxicities of various concentrations of parasporin-2 against cultured cells were monitored using the MTT assay and the LD50 values at 24 h after administration were determined, the cytotoxicity was found to vary from cell type to cell type (Table 1). The toxin proteins were evenly cytotoxic toward MOLT-4, Jurkat, HL-60, and HepG2 cells, and the LD50 values against these cells were all around 20 ng/ml. HeLa cells were moderately susceptible to the 30-kDa form of parasporin-2. Next, the cytocidal activities for cell lines from other mammals were determined. The toxin was found to be inefficient toward monkey cells but toxic toward rodent cell lines (Table 2). It was of interest that the C-terminally truncated toxin killed Sawano and CACO-2 cells much more efficiently than the nontruncated 31-kDa parasporin-2. A marked difference between the cytocidal activities of the C-terminally processed and nonprocessed toxins was observed in kinetic analyses of their cytotoxicities. The 30-kDa toxin reduced HepG2 cell viability in a comparatively rapid manner, with LD50 times of 1.2 and 5 h for 0.1 mg/ml of the 30- and 31-kDa toxins, respectively, whereas the purified 37-kDa proparasporin-2 showed little toxicity toward the cells (Fig. 1E). The immediate intoxication appeared to be a general characteristic of the 30-kDa parasporin-2, because it was also observed for MOLT-4 cells (Fig. 1F). Because MOLT-4 cells suffered slower cytocidal effects than HepG2 cells, there may be a difference in the mode of the toxin action between these two cell types. Investigation for processing of the 31-kDa toxin by HepG2 cells revealed that the toxin was hardly cleaved, indicating that the 31-kDa form was not activated by cellular proteases and by itself (Fig. 1G). In any case, these results indicate that the C-terminal processing is involved in the efficient and rapid cytotoxicity of parasporin-2, in addition to its N-terminal cleavage. Subsequently, we used the highly toxic form to elucidate the cytocidal action of parasporin-2 in the experiments described below.TABLE 1Cytocidal activities of the 30-kDa and 31-kDa fragments of parasporin-2 toward various cultured human cellsCell nameCharacteristicsLD50 (μg/ml)aCell viabilities at 20 h of intoxication were determined based on the metabolically active cells using the MTT assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The LD50 (50% lethal dose) values were calculated from the cell viability data for each dose of toxin30 kDa31 kDabPreviously reported values are presented in this table (15)MOLT-4Leukemic T cells0.0220.044JurkatLeukemic T cells0.0180.015HL-60Leukemic T cells0.0190.066T cellNormal T cellsNDcND indicates not determined0.148HCNormal hepatocytes1.1>10HepG2Hepatocyte cancer0.0190.023HeLaUterine (cervical) cancer2.5>10SawanoUterine cancer0.0020.041TCSUterine (cervical) cancer7.8>10UtSMCNormal uterus2.59.28MRC-5Normal embryonic lung fibroblasts0.47.15A549Lung cancer0.34>10CACO-2Colon cancer0.0134.86a Cell viabilities at 20 h of intoxication were determined based on the metabolically active cells using the MTT assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The LD50 (50% lethal dose) values were calculated from the cell viability data for each dose of toxinb Previously reported values are presented in this table (15Ito A.

A number of balloon-like shapes suddenly emerged one after another on the cell periphery in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml of the toxin (Fig. 2A, panel b). One or several blebs surrounded each cell, gradually enlarged over a few minutes (Fig. 2B), and finally became detached from the cells (Fig. 2A, panel b, see arrowheads). The number of cells carrying blebs increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner for the range of toxin concentrations investigated (0.1-10 mg/ml; data not shown). NIH-3T3 cells showed similar morphological alterations to HepG2 cells after treatment with the toxin, whereas intoxicated MOLT-4 cells seemed to differ from the blebbing morphology, in that the cells simply swelled and contained some small vacuolated structures (Fig. 2A, panels f and g). Video documentation revealed the sequence of the morphological changes in MOLT-4 cells, which consisted of intracellular vacuolations, cell swelling, and finally cell bursting (data not shown). When the toxin-treated MOLT-4 cells were examined by TEM, many vacuolar structures were observed in the cytoplasmic space during the early stage of the toxin action (Fig. 2C, panel b), and the cytosolic volume was decreased with nuclear deformation at the late stage (Fig. 2C, panel c). Parasporin-2 hardly induced any morphological changes to HeLa cells (Fig. 2A, panel d) or COS-7 cells (data not shown), which showed low sensitivities to the toxin. Thus,"

The constituents of the DAPC must be targeted to the sarcolemma in order to properly function. Biglycan is an ECM molecule that associates with the DAPC. Here, we show that biglycan null mice exhibit a mild dystrophic phenotype and display a selective reduction in the localization of alpha-dystrobrevin-1 and -2, alpha- and beta1-syntrophin, and nNOS at the sarcolemma. Purified biglycan induces nNOS redistribution to the plasma membrane in cultured muscle cells. Biglycan protein injected into muscle becomes stably associated with the sarcolemma and ECM for at least 2 wk. This injected biglycan restores the sarcolemmal expression of alpha-dystrobrevin-1 and -2, and beta1- and beta2-syntrophin in biglycan null mice. We conclude that biglycan is important for the maintenance of muscle cell integrity and plays a direct role in regulating the expression and sarcolemmal localization of the intracellular signaling proteins dystrobrevin-1 and -2, alpha- and beta1-syntrophin and nNOS."

Chem. 2000; 275: 29923-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Four members designated syndecan-1–4, each encoded by distinct genes, comprise the syndecan family. Syndecans are expressed in a cell-, tissue-, and development-specific manner. For example, expression of syndecan-1, the founding member of the syndecans, is first detected at the 4-cell stage in mouse embryos, suggesting that its expression is zygotically activated (3Sutherland A.E. Sanderson R.D. Mayes M. Seibert M. Calarco P.G. Bernfield M. Damsky C.H. Development. 1991; 113: 339-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In adult tissue, syndecan-1 is the major HSPG expressed on the surface of stratified epithelial cells and plasma cells, and on the basolateral surface of simple epithelial cells (4Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Other cell types, such as fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells, also express syndecan-1 to a lesser degree. Syndecans bind and regulate a wide variety of soluble and insoluble ligands, such as growth factors, extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and chemokines, through their HS chains (1Bernfield M.

At the cell surface, syndecans frequently serve as coreceptors that catalyze the interaction between ligands and their respective signaling receptors. Cell surface syndecans bind ligands and increase ligand concentration in the pericellular vicinity of their respective signaling receptors. Cell surface syndecans can also regulate receptor-ligand interactions by affecting the stability, conformation or oligomerization state of both ligands and receptors through their HS chains (2Park P.W. Reizes O. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29923-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Further, syndecans can function as soluble HSPGs because their extracellular ectodomains replete with all their HS chains can be proteolytically cleaved and shed into the extracellular milieu by a process known as ectodomain shedding (1Bernfield M.

These results indicate that certain post-developmental functions of syndecans cannot be compensated by other HSPGs. How syndecans function specifically in post-developmental processes is not known. One of the potential underlying mechanisms is differential regulation of syndecan expression. Syndecan expression is regulated in a temporal and spatial manner, and these features may enable these HSPGs to function specifically in vivo. For instance, syndecan-1 expression in mesenchymal cells is induced at the transcriptional level by platelet derived growth factor (17Cizmeci-Smith G. Stahl R.C. Showalter L.J. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18740-18747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), angiotensin II (17Cizmeci-Smith G. Stahl R.C. Showalter L.J. Carey D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6435-6441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Syndecan-1 expression can also be up-regulated post-transcriptionally in stratifying keratinocytes (20Sanderson R.D. Hinkes M.T. Bernfield M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 390-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and in mesenchymal cells during kidney formation (21Vainio S. Jalkanen M. Bernfield M. Saxen L. Dev. Biol. 1992; 152: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and in resident peritoneal macrophages (22Yeaman C. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that regulation of expression is one of the fundamental mechanisms that allows syndecans to perform specific functions in a spatial and temporal manner in vivo. To better understand how syndecan expression is regulated, we investigated how syndecan-1 is regulated in epithelial cells. Syndecan-1 is the predominant HSPG of epithelial cells, but the regulation of its expression in epithelial cells has not been studied in detail. Our results showed that among several bioactive agents tested only forskolin and TGFβ significantly induced syndecan-1 expression on epithelial cells. Induction of syndecan-1 by TGFβ was inhibited by transfection of a dominant-negative construct of PKA and by specific inhibitors of PKA. Our results also showed that the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain is Ser-phosphorylated by PKA when epithelial cells are treated with TGFβ. Further, substitution of the invariant Ser286 with Gly in the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain abrogated its induction by TGFβ. These data support a regulatory mechanism in which TGFβ, PKA, and the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain coordinate to induce cell surface expression of syndecan-1 in epithelial cells.

Briefly, confluent or 1-day post-confluent NMuMG and C127 cells in 96-well plates and A549 cells in 24-well plates were washed once with their respective culture medium and various test samples diluted in culture medium were added to cells. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times as described in the figure legends. Cells were then washed once with ice-cold TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.5 mm EDTA and then incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin in TBS with 0.5 mm EDTA.

Trypsinates were spun down and acidified by adding NaOAc (pH 4.5) to a final concentration of 50 mm, and blotted onto Immobilon Ny+ membranes using a dot blotting apparatus. By acidifying the samples, only highly anionic molecules, such as syndecan-1, are retained by the cationic Immobilon Ny+ membrane while most proteins pass through the membrane during dot blotting. To obtain measurements in the linear range, various sample volumes were blotted onto Immobilon Ny+ membranes.

Cell surface levels of syndecan-4 were measured by FACS because trypsin digestion destroyed the antigenic epitope of the Ky8.2 anti-mouse syndecan-4 antibody. Briefly, NMuMG cells in 6-well plates were incubated with or without 10 ng/ml TGFβ2 for 2 days. Cells were detached by incubating with 5 mm EDTA in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C, washed, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 30 min on ice. Fixed cells were incubated with or without 20 μg/ml Ky8.2 anti-syndecan-4 antibodies in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS at room temperature for 2 h. Cells were washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rat IgG mouse antibodies. Cells were fixed again with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS and washed three times with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS. The fluorescence associated with cells was measured by a flow cytometer (EPICS-XL, Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Western Immunoblotting of Syndecan-1—NMuMG cells were incubated with or without 10 ng/ml of TGFβ2 for 2 days, and syndecan-1 was released from the cell surface by mild trypsin digestion as described above. Trypsinates were acidified by the addition of NaOAc (pH 4.5) and NaCl to final concentrations of 100 and 300 mm, respectively, and syndecan-1 was partially purified by DEAE ion-exchange chromatography. Samples containing ∼30 ng of partially-purified syndecan-1 were resuspended in digestion buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaOAc, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and digested with 20 milliunits/ml heparinase III and 30 milliunits/ml CS ABC lyase or with 30 milliunits/ml CS ABC lyase only for 3 h at 37°C. 30 ng of CS ABC lyase-digested and undigested syndecan-1 were fractionated by 6% SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted onto Immobilon Ny+ membranes. Syndecan-1 digested with heparinase III and CS ABC lyase was fractionated by 5–15% gradient SDS-PAGE, and Western-blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with the 281-2 anti-mouse syndecan-1 antibody. Transfection of the PKA Dominant-negative Construct—The PKA dominant-negative expression construct, MT-REVAB-neo, was kindly provided by Dr. Stanley McKnight (Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA). MT-REVAB-neo harbors a PKA cDNA insert with point mutations in both cAMP-binding sites (26Rogers K.V. Goldman P.S. Frizzell R.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8975-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Transcription of the dominant-negative construct is driven by the metallothionein promoter and expression can be increased by ≥10-fold by the addition of Zn2+ or Cd2+. However, we tested the effects of this mutant PKA construct without heavy metal stimulation because basal expression of MT-REVAB-neo was shown to be sufficient to significantly inhibit endogenous PKA activation in T84 intestinal epithelial cells (26Rogers K.V. Goldman P.S. Frizzell R.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8975-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and to avoid unforeseen effects of Zn2+ or Cd2+. To determine the effects of the PKA dominant-negative construct on TGFβ-induced syndecan-1 expression, NMuMG cells in 96-well plates were transfected with 4 μg of MT-REVAB-neo or pUC13 (mock transfection) by Lipofectamine. After 2 days, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml of TGFβ2 or incubated with fresh culture medium for 2 days at 37 °C, and cell surface levels of syndecan-1 were measured. Expression of Recombinant Syndecan Constructs—A cDNA construct encoding Leu17–Pro234 in the ectodomain of mouse syndecan-1 was subcloned into the His6 tag expression vector, pQE30 (Qiagen). Expression and purification were performed with the B-PER His6 fusion protein purification kit. Briefly, gene expression was induced by incubating transformed Escherichia coli (M15[pREP4]) in logarithmic growth with 1.25 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3 h. Cells were lysed with B-PER reagent, cell lysates were fractionated by Ni2+-chelated agarose chromatography, and bound proteins were eluted with B-PER elution buffer. A cDNA construct encoding Lys280–Ala311 of the cytoplasmic domain of mouse syndecan-1, and a construct encoding Arg170–Ala202 of the cytoplasmic domain of mouse syndecan-4 were subcloned into the GST fusion protein expression vector, pGEX2T. Expression was induced by incubating transformed E. coli (BL21) in broth containing 1.25 mm IPTG for 3 h. Induced E. coli cells were lysed by incubation in PBS containing 10 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.5 mm EDTA for 30 min at 37 °C. Recombinant syndecan proteins were purified from cell lysates by glutathione-Sepharose 4B chromatography. For some experiments, the GST tag was removed from the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-1 by thrombin cleavage. Co-immunoprecipitation—NMuMG cells treated with or without TGFβ2 were lysed in PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.5 mm EDTA. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min and 150 μl of the supernatant was preabsorbed with 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The preabsorbed cell lysate was then incubated with 3 μg of 281-2 anti-syndecan-1 or Ky8.2 anti-syndecan-4 antibody for 6 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Protein G-agarose beads (20 μl) were added to each sample and incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and resuspended in non-reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, Western-blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-PKA regulatory subunit antibodies. In some experiments, 281-2 immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence of an excess concentration (150 μg/ml) of recombinant syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain devoid of GST. To determine if the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain is Ser- or Thr-phosphorylated, cells treated with TGFβ2 in the presence or absence of KT5720 for 2 days were treated with 10 μg/ml TPCK-trypsin and lysed with PBS containing 650 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysates were diluted 5-fold with autoclaved de-ionized H2O, and immunoprecipitated with the anti-syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain antibody and protein A-agarose. The immunoprecipitated material was resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western immunoblotting with anti-phosphoserine, anti-phosphothreonine, or anti-syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain antibodies. In Vitro Phosphorylation of Recombinant Syndecan Proteins by PKA—In vitro phosphorylation of recombinant syndecan-1 and -4 cytoplasmic domains and syndecan-1 ectodomain by PKA was assessed using the PKA assay kit (Upstate). Briefly, syndecan-1 and -4 cytoplasmic domains (10 and 6 μg, respectively) or syndecan-1 ectodomain (6 μg) were incubated with or without 800 units of the PKA catalytic domain and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (∼3000 Ci/mmol) for 10 min at 30 °C in 60-μl reaction buffer provided with the kit. One-fifth of the reaction mixture was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Adenoviral Expression of Wild Type and Point-mutated Syndecan-1 Constructs—To generate the S286G syndecan-1 expression construct, a single nucleotide substitution was made in full-length mouse syndecan-1 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis using the sequential PCR protocol. For replacement of invariant Ser286 to Gly, we used 5′-GACGAAGGCGGCTACTCCTT-3′ and its complementary primer (substituted nucleotide is indicated in bold) in the first PCR reaction. PCR products in the second PCR reaction were subcloned into pcDNA3.1V5His. Adenoviruses bearing wild type (pAd/Sdc1-WT/V5) and S286G-mutated mouse syndecan-1 (pAd/Sdc1-S286G/V5) were prepared with a ViraPower Adenovirus Expression System according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, full-length cDNAs minus the stop codon of wild type and S286G syndecan-1 were amplified by PCR with Accuprime with corresponding templates described above, and the CDS was subcloned into the pENTER/S.D./D-TOPO vector in-frame with a pENTER Directional TOPO cloning kit. After verifying the correct sequence, the insert was transferred into pAd/CMV/V5-DEST vector by the Gateway system using LR clonase. To obtain virus particles, plasmids were linearized by PacI (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) digestion and transfected into 293A cells with Lipofectamine 2000. When most cells were detached (∼1–2 weeks), cells were harvested by gentle pipetting in culture media. Cells were lysed by freeze/thawing, centrifuged, and supernatants were collected as crude viral lysates. To amplify virus titers, 100 μl of crude viral lysates were added to fresh 293A cells and cultured for several days until all cells were detached. Virus-enriched supernatants were collected, and viral titers were determined by the plaque-forming assay with 293A cells. A431 cells in 96-well plates were transduced with adenovirus harboring wild type or mutant S286G syndecan-1 with an MOI of 15 in culture medium. The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium the next day, and after an additional 24 h of incubation, cells were incubated with or without TGFβ2 for 2 days. Cell surface syndecan-1 was quantified by mild trypsinization and dot immunoblotting as described above. Expression of Cell Surface Syndecan-1 Is Highly Regulated in NMuMG Epithelial Cells—We initially tested the ability of several bioactive agents to regulate the cell surface expression of syndecan-1 in NMuMG cells (Fig. 1A). NMuMG cells were incubated for 24 h with agents that induce syndecan-1 shedding (PMA, ceramide, EGF), calcium ionophores (ionomycin, A23187), a secondary messenger analogue (dbcGMP), an adenylate cyclase activator that stimulates cAMP generation (forskolin), an inducer of the Toll-like receptor 4-mediated innate host response (LPS), or molecules that have been shown to down-(TNFα) or up-regulate (TGFβ, FGF-2) syndecan-1 expression in endothelial cells and fibroblasts, respectively. Among these, only forskolin and TGFβ2 markedly increased cell surface levels of syndecan-1 by ∼3- and 5-fold, respectively, over control cells incubated with fresh culture medium. PMA, ceramide, EGF, dbcGMP, ionomycin, A23187, and LPS had marginal effects on cell surface levels of syndecan-1. Surprisingly, TNFα and FGF-2 also had little effect on syndecan-1 expression, despite the fact that these molecules have been shown to transcriptionally regulate syndecan-1 expression in other cell types. Because epithelial cells express both p55 and p75 TNFα receptors (27Varela L.M. Ip M.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4915-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and proliferate in response to FGF-2 (28Ornitz D.M. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16305-16311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these findings suggest that downstream signaling components that are essential in the regulation of syndecan-1 expression by TNFα and FGF-2 are lacking in epithelial cells.

E., Feng, J., Allen, P. B., Lefkowitz, R. J., Greengard, P., and Limbird, L. E. (2004) Science 304, 1940–1944). The present studies address whether arrestin plays a role in determining the route of α2AR-evoked ERK signaling activation, taking advantage of endogenous expression of the α2AAR subtype in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and the availability of MEFs without arrestin expression (derived from Arr2,3–/– mice). Our data demonstrate that the endogenous α2AAR evokes ERK phosphorylation through both a Src-dependent and a Src-independent pathway, both of which are G protein dependent and converge on the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway. Arrestin is essential to recruit Src to this process, as α2AAR-mediated ERK signaling in Arr2,3–/– MEFs does not involve Src. Stimulation of α2AAR enhances arrestin-Src interaction and promotes activation of Src. α2 agonists have similar potencies in stimulating Src-dependent and Src-independent ERK phosphorylation in wild-type and Arr2,3–/– cells, respectively. However, Src-independent α2AAR-mediated ERK stimulation has both a longer duration of activation and a more rapid translocation of pERK into the nucleus when compared with Src-dependent activation. These data not only affirm the role of arrestin as an escort for signaling molecules such as Src family kinases but also demonstrate the impact of arrestin-dependent modulation on both the temporal and spatial properties of ERK activation.

GPCRs activate the MAPK cascades through divergent pathways involving tyrosine kinases, small GTPases, and other effectors (1Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) by GPCRs can occur through G protein-dependent and G protein-independent pathways and that arrestin is the essential mediator of the latter pathway (1Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Arrestin is a family of proteins with multifunctions in GPCR regulation (2Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J.

In non-sensory systems, ubiquitously expressed arrestin 2 (β-arrestin 1) and 3 (β-arrestin 2) also serve as adaptors for linking GPCRs to endocytosis machinery by directly binding to both the heavy chain of clathrin (12Goodman Jr., O.B.

Depending on their association with arrestin post-endocytosis, GPCRs are classified into two families (3Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochem.

Class A receptors dissociate from arrestin after internalization and are rapidly recycled back to the cell surface. By contrast, class B receptors stay associated with arrestin after internalization and are eventually subjected to lysosomal degradation. In addition to its functions in mediating desensitization and internalization, arrestin has been implicated as scaffolding protein linking receptors to downstream signaling pathways including the ERK pathway (16Luttrell L.M.

The regulatory role of arrestin in ERK activation by these receptors, if any, has not been fully clarified to date. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the α2-adrenergic receptor (AR), a class A receptor, evokes phosphorylation of ERK1/2 through G protein-dependent pathways and this process does not require arrestin-mediated receptor endocytosis (22Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Wang Q. Zhao J. Brady A.E. Feng J. Allen P.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Greengard P. Limbird L.E. Science. 2004; 304: 1940-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, arrestin does regulate the time course of α2AR-mediated ERK activation, and the presence of arrestin accelerates the rate of ERK activation by the α2AR (26Wang Q. Zhao J. Brady A.E. Feng J. Allen P.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Greengard P. Limbird L.E. Science. 2004; 304: 1940-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To further explore the role of arrestin in the α2AR-mediated G protein-dependent activation of ERK, we analyzed ERK phosphorylation stimulated by endogenous α2AAR in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with or without (Arr2,3–/–) arrestin expression. Here we report that the α2AR mediates ERK activation through Src-dependent and Src-independent pathways. Even though arrestin is dispensable for α2AR-mediated ERK activation per se, it is required for Src kinase involvement in this process. Our data reveal that arrestin3 forms a complex with c-Src and agonist stimulation of the α2AR promotes both arrestin-Src interaction and Src phosphorylation at Tyr-416 (representing active Src). Our findings also reveal that the Src-independent activation of ERK signaling by the endogenous α2AAR in Arr2,3–/– MEFs is of longer duration and phospho-ERK (pERK) is more rapidly translocated into nuclei of Arr2,3–/– cells than in wild-type (WT) cells.

Cell Culture—MEFs and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C/5% CO2. Determination of Receptor Density—Endogenous α2AAR receptor density in MEFs was assayed using standard saturation binding protocols with 3H-Rauwolscine (PerkinElmer) as described in Ref. 28Edwards S.W. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16331-16336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and non-linear regression analysis using Graph-Pad Prism. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from WT and Arr2,3–/– MEFs using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription of the first strand was carried out using the Super-Script first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). PCR analysis was then performed to amplify α2A-, α2B-, and α2CAR using subtype-specific primers. Specific primers for amplifying the α2AAR were 5′-GGAGCCCGCGCCCGCCG-3′ and 5′-GCTGGGCACCGGGCAGCCGACC-3′. α2BAR-specific primers were 5′-TCAGTCCAGGACCAGAAGAA-3′ and 5′-CATGGGGTACCTTGCAGTG-3′. α2CAR-specific primers were 5′-ACGGCGTCTCGGTCCCCAG-3′ and 5′-TGGCAACTGGCAGGCCTCAC-3′. Amplification products using individual plasmid containing the coding region of each subtype as templates were loaded as controls. Measurement of ERK Activation—ERK activation (active/total) was measured as described previously (22Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Active (pERK) and total ERKs were detected by Western analysis using corresponding antibodies (Cell Signaling). For pertussis toxin treatment, 200 ng/ml was added to culture for 20 h before and during the time of stimulation of cells. For other inhibitor treatment, drugs in the amounts indicated in figure legends were added to culture for 1 h before and during the time of stimulation of cells. Immunofluorescence of pERK in MEFs—pERK in MEFs was detected by pERK antibody (Cell Signaling) using the immunostaining protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, MEFs cultured on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C followed by three washes in TBST (Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and 0.1% Triton X-100). After one wash in TBS buffer, cells were further fixed/permeabilized with 100% MeOH for 5 min at –20 °C. Following three washes with TBST, cells were blocked with 5% horse serum in TBST for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with pERK antibody (diluted 1:400 in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin) overnight at 4 °C. AlexaFluor-488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) was used as the secondary antibody at 1:1000 (diluted in TBST containing 3% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescent images were taken using a LSM510 confocal microscope (in the Vanderbilt University shared imaging facility). Co-immunoprecipitation of c-Src and Arrestin3—Direct interaction between c-Src and arrestin was assessed using co-immunoprecipitation strategy. CosM6 cells cotransfected with cDNA encoding α2AAR (29Guyer C.A. Horstman D.A. Wilson A.L. Clark J.D. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Limbird L.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 50589-50596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) protein (0.6, 1, and 6 μg/10-cm plate, respectively) were serum starved overnight and treated with or without 100 μm epinephrine for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1 μm propranolol (to block trace endogenous βAR) and 1 μm prazosin (to block trace endogenous α1AR, if any exists). Cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (pH 7.6) containing 15 mm Hepes, 5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm EDTA followed by 20 min of centrifugation at 18,000 × g at 4 °C. Pellets (representing the raw membrane fraction) were extracted by DβM/CHS buffer (4 mg/ml dodecyl β-maltoside, 0.8 mg/ml cholesteryl hemisuccinate, 20% glycerol, 25 mm glyglycine, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA) (31Wang Q. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50589-50596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and subjected to immunoprecipitation using rat anti-HA antibody and Protein G-agarose as described previously (31Wang Q. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50589-50596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Western analyses were performed following ECL Western blotting protocols (Amersham Biosciences) to detect p-Src, HA-Src, and GFP-arrestin using phospho-Src antibody (Tyr-416), HA.11 antibody, and GFP antibody, respectively. Endogenously Expressed α2AARs in MEFs Activate ERK through the Gi/o Family of G Proteins—To explore the function of arrestin on endogenous α2AR-mediated signaling, we evaluated MEFs, which express the α2AAR subtype (but not the α2BAR or α2CAR subtypes) endogenously, as revealed by reverse transcription PCR (Fig. 1A). Functional α2AR expression in these cells was documented by [3H]Rauwolscine binding (74.3 ± 10.7 fmol/mg protein detected at the KD for [3H]Rauwolscine; data not shown). Stimulation of endogenous α2AAR in MEFs with α2 agonists allows an assessment of α2AR activation of ERK in native cells (Fig. 1B). For the studies in Fig. 1B, we used the endogenous α2 agonist epinephrine in the presence of propranolol to block βAR and prazosin to block α1AR (see “Experimental Procedures”) to stimulate the α2AAR. ERK activation by the α2AAR in MEFs can also be evoked by clonidine, UK 14,304 (data not shown), and dexmedetomidine (Fig. 1D) and can be blocked by the α2 antagonist yohimbine (Fig. 1B). As discussed earlier, there is evidence for GPCR activation of ERK by G protein-dependent and -independent pathways (19Tohgo A. Choy E.W. Gesty-Palmer D. Pierce K.L. Laporte S. Oakley R.H. Caron M.G.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). ERK activation by α2ARs in MEFs is eliminated by pretreatment of MEFs by pertussis toxin (Fig. 1, B and C, PTx), demonstrating that endogenous α2AAR activation of ERK in MEFs is mediated by G proteins of the Gi/Go subtype, consistent with the properties of α2AAR activation of ERK in heterologous systems (33Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 34Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the G protein dependence of ERK activation by endogenous α2AAR in MEFs occurs both in WT cells, which express arrestins, and in cells derived from mice null for arrestin 2 and 3 (Arr2,3–/–). The data in Fig. 1, B and C, emphasize that arrestin-dependent receptor endocytosis is not a requirement for α2AAR-mediated ERK signaling, although arrestin-dependent endocytosis, followed by recycling, leads to an arrestin-dependent acceleration of α2AR activation of ERK (26Wang Q. Zhao J. Brady A.E. Feng J. Allen P.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Greengard P. Limbird L.E. Science. 2004; 304: 1940-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We asked whether arrestins would alter the potency of α2AR agonists in activating ERK as a result of the rapid regeneration of native α2AAR in arrestin-expressing cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, the EC50 of the α2AR agonist/partial agonist dexmedetomidine in activating ERK in Arr2,3–/– MEFs (4.0 × 10–8 m) is comparable with that in WT cells (0.84 × 10–8 m). In addition, the maximal activation of ERK by dexmedetomidine in Arr2,3–/– MEFs is similar to that in WT cells (Fig. 1D). A similar potency for ERK activation in WT versus Arr2,3–/– MEFs was also observed in response to the α2AR partial agonist UK 14,304 (data not shown). We chose partial agonists for these studies as they are most sensitive to revealing difference in coupling efficiency between receptors and effectors (36Kenakin T.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 81: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 37Tan C.M. Wilson M.H. MacMillan L.B. Kobilka B.K. Limbird L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12471-12476Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the presence of arrestins, although accelerating the rate of ERK activation in MEFs (Fig. 2, below, and Ref. 26Wang Q. Zhao J. Brady A.E. Feng J. Allen P.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Greengard P. Limbird L.E. Science. 2004; 304: 1940-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), does not significantly change the potency or the efficacy of α2 agonists in activating ERK. Lack of Arrestins Alters the Temporal Pattern of α2AAR-elicited ERK Activation—Although the data in Fig. 1, B–D, indicate that arrestins are not required for α2AAR activation in MEFs, we nonetheless wanted to explore whether arrestin had any regulatory impact on endogenous α2AAR-evoked, G protein-dependent ERK signaling. We noted, as shown in Fig. 2, that arrestin alters both the time of onset and the duration of α2AAR-evoked activation of ERK in MEFs. In WT cells, endogenous α2AAR-evoked ERK activation peaks at 2 min and then declines, due to desensitization of receptor-mediated signaling. Virtually no stimulation is detected after 20 min of treatment with α2AR agonists in WT MEFs that express arrestin (Fig. 2). In cells without arrestin expression, the time to peak stimulation appears to be delayed (Fig. 2B). In addition, the desensitization of α2AAR-evoked ERK signal is less rapid and occurs to a lesser extent; thus, ∼40% of ERK activity remains detectable after 20 min of treatment with the α2 agonist (Fig. 2). This extended ERK activation in Arr2,3–/– cells lasts for another 3 h in the presence of agonist before becoming fully desensitized (data not shown). The impaired desensitization of α2AAR signaling seen in Arr2,3–/– cells is consistent with the well appreciated roles of arrestins in the receptor desensitization process (38Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Enrichment of pERK in the Nucleus following Agonist Treatment Is Independent of Arrestin Expression—We examined the morphological distribution of pERK following α2 agonist activation of MEFs. Detection of pERK in WT MEFs first occurs in cytosol (see the 1-min time point in Fig. 3), but pERK becomes enriched in nuclei after agonist stimulation for 10 min (Fig. 3). In Arr2,3–/– MEFs, the α2AAR-evoked pERK signal is highly enriched in nuclei at all time points examined, including the earliest time point measured, i.e. 1 min (Fig. 3). Whether pERK is activated in the nucleus, without required cytosolic to nuclear transport, is not known, but cytosolic pERK was barely detectable at the earliest time points in our studies of Arr2,3–/– MEFs. Endogenous α2AAR-evoked ERK Activation Is Ras-Raf Dependent Both in the Presence and Absence of Arrestins—It has been reported that the α2AR activates ERK signaling through a Gβγ- and a Ras-Raf-dependent pathway (39Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Here we examined whether this is also true in cells without arrestin expression. As shown in Fig. 4, inhibitors of Ras (Ftase inhibitor I) and Raf (Raf inhibitor II) blocked ∼80% of ERK activation elicited by endogenous α2AAR in both WT and Arr2,3–/– cells, indicating that the α2AAR still activate ERK through the G protein-Ras-Raf pathway even without arrestin expression. It has been reported that Gβγ activation of Ras is sensitive to phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitors (40Touhara K. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9284-9287Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 41van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), suggesting that PI3K can serve as an intermediate linking GPCRs to ERK signaling. Therefore, we examined the effect of PI3K inhibitor treatment in ERK activation mediated by the endogenous α2AAR in MEFs. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 failed to alter α2AAR-evoked ERK activation in either WT or Arr2,3–/– MEFs (Fig. 4, A and B), although control studies confirmed that LY294002 was active, as it blocked serum-induced phosphorylation of Akt (a known downstream target of PI3K) in parallel experiments (Fig. 4, C and D). These data indicate that PI3K is not involved in this process. Lack of Arrestins Eliminates Sensitivity of α2AAR Activation of pERK to Src Family Kinase Inhibitors—Because arrestins have been reported to serve as a scaffold for the β2AR, MEK, ERK, and Src (16Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. la Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar), we explored whether activation of Src kinase is a critical link between α2AAR activation and ERK phosphorylation and whether arrestin is necessary for this role of Src, if it occurs. The overall involvement of a tyrosine kinase (or kinases) in α2AAR activation of ERK in WT cells is evident in Fig. 5, where we observed elimination of agonist-stimulated ERK phosphorylation in the presence of the general tyrosine inhibitor genistein. This involvement of tyrosine kinases is not due to transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase, because α2AAR activation was insensitive to inhibition by the EGF receptor kinase inhibitor, AG1478 (Fig. 5), whereas this agent completely eliminated effects of EGF on ERK phosphorylation in parallel control experiments (data not shown). For WT MEFs, the Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 eliminated the α2AAR activation of ERK (Fig. 5), suggesting that sensitivity to genistein may be accounted for by the role of Src family kinase in linking α2AAR activation to ERK phosphorylation. The involvement of Src kinase in α2AAR-mediated ERK activation is confirmed by the fact that expression of a kinase-inactive dominant negative Src (SrcK297R) (42Irby R.B. Yeatman T.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2669-2674PubMed Google Scholar) remarkably reduced ERK phosphorylation following α2AAR stimulation (Fig. 6). However, a different pathway appears to link the α2AAR to ERK phosphorylation in cells lacking arrestin expression, because stimulation of p-ERK accumulation in Arr2,3–/– MEFs is independent of either genistein or Src kinase inhibitors (Fig. 5). Thus, in the absence of arrestin expression, the α2AAR appears to engage an additional signaling pathway to phosphorylate ERK, a Src kinase-independent pathway.FIGURE 6Dominant negative c-Src inhibits α2AAR-evoked ERK signals in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells transiently transfected with vector alone or DN Src (K297R) were treated with α2 agonist (10–4 m epinephrine + 10–6 m propranolol + 10–6 m prazosin) for 5 min. Cell lysates were blotted for pERK and total ERK. A, representative blots detecting p-ERK and total ERK, respectively. B, summary of quantitative data from three independent experiments. Percent increase of ERK activity over basal (±S.E.) was plotted using GraphPad Prism®.*, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further examined α2AAR-mediated ERK activation in cells lacking expression of the Src family kinases using Src-null SYF cells derived from Src, Yes, and Fyn triple knock-out mouse embryos. Consistent with the above findings, the α2AAR activated ERK in SYF cells, affirming its ability to do so in a Src-null, thus Src-independent, environment (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, similar to findings in Arr2,3–/– MEFs, the α2AAR-evoked pERK signal in SYF cells is highly enriched in nuclei at the earliest time point of measurement (Fig. 7B). In contrast, when c-Src is reconstituted in SYF cells (i.e. SYF+c-Src cells), α2AAR-evoked pERK signal is mainly distributed in cytosol at this early 2-min time point (Fig. 7B). Agonist Stimulation of the α2AAR Enhances Arrestin3 Interaction with c-Src as Well as Src Activation—Our data suggest that arrestin may serve as a scaffold linking Src kinase to α2AAR-evoked ERK signaling pathways. Direct interaction between c-Src and arrestin has been reported previously (16Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. la Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 43Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Ahn S. Khan K.D. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11312-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Here we examined whether Src and arrestin interact under our experimental conditions and whether activation of α2AR has any impact on this interaction. As shown in Fig. 8, agonist occupancy of the α2AAR remarkably enriched the amount of arrestin3 in the HA-Src immunoisolated complex by 3.1-fold, indicating that activation of α2AAR enhances formation of the arrestin-Src complex. Moreover, the amount of active Src (detected by antibody against p-Tyr-416) in cells was increased following agonist stimulation, even though the amount of total Src (detected by the anti-HA antibody) is not changed (Fig. 8). These data strongly suggest that stimulation of α2AAR promotes arrestin-Src interaction and Src activation. Arrestin regulates GPCR-mediated signaling in a variety of ways. Arrestin binding to activated and phosphorylated receptors uncouples G proteins from these receptors, thus desensitizing G protein-dependent signaling (2Perry S.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 130-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Arrestin also is required for GPCR internalization (12Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, 13Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 2003; 375: 503-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Arrestin-dependent endocytosis and subsequent recycling enhances the initial rate of GPCR-mediated signaling, at least in some settings (26Wang Q. Zhao J. Brady A.E. Feng J. Allen P.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Greengard P. Limbird L.E. Science. 2004; 304: 1940-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, arrestin can serve as a scaffold to directly link receptors to downstream signaling effectors in a G protein-independent manner (20Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; : 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Our current studies demonstrated that in the process of G protein-dependent ERK activation by the α2AR, arrestin not only is critical for desensitization of this process (Fig. 2) but also is required for involvement of the Src family of tyrosine kinases in this event (Figs. 5 and 9). As shown schematically in Fig. 9, ERK stimulation by the α2AR requires the Gi/o subfamily of G proteins. With arrestin present, G proteins activate Src tyrosine kinase, which subsequently activates the Ras-Raf pathway and results in ERK phosphorylation. In this process, arrestin serves as a scaffold recruiting Src to the plasma membrane for activation by G proteins (Figs. 8 and 9), by analogy to its role in ERK activation by β2AR (16Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. la Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). In contrast to β2AR-mediated ERK activation, which appears to require arrestin-dependent endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits (44Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), α2AR-evoked ERK activation does not require endocytosis (22Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Wang Q. Zhao J. Brady A.E. Feng J. Allen P.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Greengard P. Limbird L.E. Science. 2004; 304: 1940-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, even without arrestin expression (in Arr2,3–/– MEFs), α2AR agonists are still able to evoke ERK phosphorylation and do so with a potency similar to that observed in WT cells (Fig. 1D). Arrestin-independent ERK activation occurs through a G protein-dependent but Src-independent pathway that requires Ras activation (Figs. 4, 5, and 9). Therefore, our data reveal that arrestin serves as a molecular switch determining the signal transduction route of ERK activation by the α2AR. Our data also demonstrate an important role of arrestin in modulating the temporal and spatial profiles of α2AR-mediated ERK activation. In cells without the arrestin-mediated desensitization process, the duration of the α2AR-evoked pERK signal is considerably extended (Fig. 2), lasting up to 5 h (data not shown). In Arr2,3–/– cells, α2AR-evoked phosphorylation of ERK is detected principally in the nucleus, without detectable prior phosphorylation in the cytosol (Figs. 3 and 9), indicating a role of arrestin in retaining ERK localization in the cytosol. The ERK signaling pathway is critical for multiple cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration, and the duration and subcellular localization of pERK are the major factors determining what cellular response active ERK signaling would trigger (45Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar, 46Colucci-D'Amato L. Perrone-Capano C. di Porzio U. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Therefore, the changes in duration and localization of α2AR-evoked pERK due to absence of arrestin observed in this study may result in significant alteration of α2AR-mediated cellular responses. For example, the sustained nuclear-localized pERK in the absence of arrestin may lead to transcription of certain responsive genes and subsequently activate cellular response pathways mediated by these genes. Our data also eliminate PI3K and transactivation of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase as contributors to α2AR-mediated ERK activation in native cells. Our present findings revealed that α2AAR-evoked ERK phosphorylation in MEFs is not altered by PI3K inhibitor LY290004 (Fig. 4), indicating that PI3K is not involved in the α2AAR-stimulated G protein-Ras-Raf signaling pathway. This is in contrast to previous findings that PI3K is employed by some GPCRs such as dopamine D2 and D3 receptors to activate ERK (24Beom S. Cheong D. Torres G. Caron M.G. Kim K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28304-28314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Similarly, although some GPCRs activate ERK by transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the EGF receptor (32Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), our findings revealed that α2AR activation of ERK signaling is not significantly altered by the EGF receptor inhibitor AG1478 in either WT or Arr2,3–/– MEFs (Fig. 5). Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence of the role of arrestin as a determinant of Src kinase-dependent versus Src kinase-independent activation of p42/44 ERK by endogenous α2AAR despite the absence of an obligatory role of arrestin in linking α2AAR to ERK activation. These findings add arrestin to the list of “molecular switches” in GPCR signaling. Furthermore, the data demonstrate a possible role for arrestin and Src kinase-dependent pathway of ERK activation in dictating the rate and extent of nuclear localization of pERK.

In diabetic humans and animal models, elevated levels of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) are observed in several tissues. Our study shows that activity of p38 is significantly elevated in livers of db/db or streptozocin-induced type 1 diabetic mice. Using cultured hepatoma cells, we find that activation of p38 enhances expression of hepatic gluconeogenic gene phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that activation of p38 stimulates phosphorylation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) at serine 21 and increases its transactivation activity in the context of PEPCK gene transcription. Our results indicate that C/EBPα mediates p38-stimulated PEPCK transcription in liver cells.

After a meal, part of the absorbed glucose is transported into the liver and converted to glycogen and other molecules for energy storage. During fasting, in addition to glycogenolysis, the hepatocytes synthesize glucose via gluconeogenesis using non-carbohydrate substrates. The precise and dynamic switch between hepatic glucose uptake and output is essential for maintaining blood glucose concentration in a normal range. In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, excessive hepatic gluconeogenesis contributes to hyperglycemia (1DeFronzo R.A. Simonson D. Ferrannini E.

Although new transcription factors and signaling pathways have recently been identified that regulate expression of hepatic gluconeogenic genes, the underlying molecular mechanisms that provoke inappropriate hepatic gluconeogenesis in diabetes are still poorly understood. Hepatic gluconeogenesis is tightly controlled by hormones that regulate expression of gluconeogenic enzymes such as PEPCK 2The abbreviations used are: PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PGC-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; MKK, MAP kinase kinase; G6Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase; ATF, activating ranscription factor; WT, wild type. and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). PEPCK is generally considered to be the first committed step in gluconeogenesis. The regulation of PEPCK is executed primarily at the transcriptional level because allosteric modification of PEPCK has not been described (4Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 5Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1705-1715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of PEPCK has been extensively studied, and a cluster of transcription factors or coactivators is involved in this regulatory process (5Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1705-1715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). One of these transcription factors is CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα), which is the founding member of the C/EBP family and which was first identified in crude nuclear extracts from rat liver (6Johnson P.F. Landschulz W.H. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). C/EBPα is preferentially expressed in the liver, adipose tissue, certain cells of the lung, and the mammary glands (7McKnight S.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 259-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). There is overwhelming evidence that C/EBPα is an important regulator of integrative processes that control glucose homeostasis (5Hanson R.W. J. Biol.

C/EBPα–/– mice die soon after birth because of hypoglycemia caused by impaired hepatic glycogen storage and low expression of gluconeogenic enzymes, including PEPCK and G6Pase (8Flodby P. Barlow C. Kylefjord H. Ahrlund-Richter L. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24753-24760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Our recent study revealed that despite the comparable levels of total C/EBPα protein in livers of wild type and db/db diabetic mice, knocking down C/EBPα decreases PEPCK and hepatic glucose production specifically in db/db mice (11Qiao L. Maclean P.S. You H. Schaack J. Shao J. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 3060-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the transactivation activity of C/EBPα may be altered in the livers of db/db diabetic mice. Inflammation has been proposed as a pathological mechanism for type 2 diabetes. Growing evidence supports this hypothesis and demonstrates that a variety of stresses or proinflammatory cytokines, especially cytokines from adipocytes, not only contribute to insulin resistance and diabetes but also play a critical role in the development of diabetic complications (12Wellen K.E.

The p38 family of proline-directed serine/threonine kinases has four members, each encoded by individual genes (14Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.-E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). p38α is the predominant isoform in liver (15Wang X.S. Diener K. Manthey C.L. Wang S.-W. Rosenzweig B. Bray J. Delaney J.

Early studies reported that p38 stimulates activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), which increases PEPCK promoter activation in liver and kidney cells (21Cheong J. Coligan J.E. Shuman J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22714-22718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Feifel E. Obexer P. Andratsch M. Euler S. Taylor L. Tang A. Wei Y. Schramek H. Curthoys N.P.

Chem. 2005; 280: 42731-42737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) reported that p38 mediates cAMP-stimulated PEPCK and G6Pase gene expression and gluconeogenesis. These data suggest that p38 not only is a component of the cAMP signaling cascade, but it also contributes to the excessive hepatic gluconeogenesis in diabetes. Here our study shows that p38 induces phosphorylation of C/EBPα on serine 21 in liver cells. Furthermore, serine phosphorylation enhances C/EBPα transactivation activity and increases PEPCK gene expression, suggesting that C/EBPα mediates p38-induced gluconeogenic enzyme expression. Materials—Anisomycin, insulin, dibutyryl cAMP were purchased from Sigma. Specific antisera to p38, phospho-p38, ERK, phospho-ERK, JNK, phospho-JNK, phospho-C/EBPα (Ser21), and β-actin were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Anti-C/EBPα antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Culture—FAO cells, derived from the H4IIE hepatoma cell line, possess a complete gluconeogenic enzyme system. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were also used for transient transfection study. The cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA). Glucose Production Assay—Glucose production from FAO cells was measured as previous described (24Shao J. Qiao L. Janssen R.C. Pagliassotti M. Friedman J.E. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) using a colorimetric glucose oxidase assay (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, 24 h after transfection the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then incubated for 6 h at 37°C, 5% CO2 in glucose production buffer (glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm sodium lactate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 15 mm HEPES, without phenol red). To estimate rates of gluconeogenesis after activation of p38, glucose concentrations in FAO cell culture medium were measured. The glucose assays were conducted in duplicate, and the intra-assay coefficient of variation was less than 5%. Nuclear Protein Isolation and Western Blot Analysis—Total cell lysate and nuclear protein extracts were isolated as described previously (24Shao J. Qiao L. Janssen R.C. Pagliassotti M. Friedman J.E. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For Western blot, 76 μg of total cell lysates or 30 μg of nuclear protein extract was separated by 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel, and the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) with a Mini Trans Blot cell from Bio-Rad. After blocking with 5% fat-free milk or bovine serum albumin, the membrane was blotted with 1:1000 dilution of antibody. After washing, the membrane was blotted with a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Peroxidase activity was visualized with ECL-Plus from Amersham Biosciences. The specific band density was determined using Kodak Image Station 2000R and 1D software (Kodak, New Haven, CT). RNA Extraction and Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from plated FAO cells with TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)12–18 primer (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed using the Mx3000P real time PCR system (Stratagene) and SYBR green dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Sequences of primers are: PEPCK, 5′-ACGCCATTAAGACCATCCAG-3′ and 5′-TCGATGCCTTCCCAGTAAAC-3′; and 18S, 5′-CGAAAGCATTTGCCAAGAAT-3′ and 5′-AGTCGGCATCGTTTATGGTC-3′. Amount of PCR product was calculated from standard curves established from each primer pair. Expression data were normalized to the amount of 18S PCR product. Plasmid Constructs—A luciferase reporter gene directed from the PEPCK promoter (pA3-PEPCK-Luc) was created as described previously (24Shao J. Qiao L. Janssen R.C. Pagliassotti M. Friedman J.E. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding MKK6(Glu) (constitutive activator of p38) and p38α were generously provided by Dr. Roger Davis (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). The plasmids expressing wild type C/EBPα, serine 21 to aspartate (pcDNA-C/EBPαS21D; mimics phosphorylation), and serine 21 to alanine (pcDNA-C/EBPαS21A; mimics dephosphorylation) were created previously (25Ross S.E. Radomska H.S. Wu B. Zhang P. Winnay J.N. Bajnok L. Wright W.S. Schaufele F. Tenen D.G. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assay—Reporter constructs and expression plasmids were transfected into cells by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). A pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid was cotransfected to control for transfection efficiency (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured (26Qiao L. Maclean P.S. Schaack J. Orlicky D.J. Darimont C. Pagliassotti M. Friedman J.E. Shao J. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1744-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The luciferase data were normalized relative to β-galactosidase luminescence and are expressed as relative luciferase activity. Experimental Animals—Male C57BL/6J and C57BL/6J-+/+Leprdb/db(db/db) mice (9–10 weeks old) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The mice were housed in a pathogen-free animal facility under a standard 12 h of light/12 h of dark cycle with free access to food and water. The experiments using mouse models were carried out under the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines with approval of the University of Kentucky Animal Care and Use Committee. Type 1 diabetic C57BL/6J mice were created with a single intraperitoneal injection of steptozotocin (180 mg/kg of body weight). Six days after the onset of diabetes, liver tissues were collected. The mice were fasted overnight before collection of the samples. Data Analysis—The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test or analysis of variance, followed by a contrast test with Tukey or Dunnett error protection. The differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Hyperactivation of p38 and Increased Phosphorylation of C/EBPα at Serine 21 in the Livers of db/db and STZ-induced Diabetic Mice—To study the roles of MAP kinase in the excessive hepatic glucose production associated with diabetes, activation of the three main MAP kinase pathways was studied in the livers of both type 1 and type 2 diabetic mouse models. Obese male db/db mice at 10 weeks of age were used as a model for type 2 diabetes, whereas administration of STZ, which destroys β-cells in the pancreas, was used to create a model for type 1 diabetes. Fasting blood glucose concentrations above 400 mg/dl were observed for both diabetic models (Table 1). To assess whether diabetes is associated with activation of MAP kinases, liver samples were collected from db/db mice and from mice 1 week after the onset of STZ-induced diabetes. Activation of p38 and ERK1/2 was measured by Western blot using anti-phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) or phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) specific antibody (Cell Signaling). JNK activities were measured using a JNK assay kit (Cell Signaling), and c-Jun fusion protein was used as substrate. The results showed that phosphorylation of p38 was significantly increased in livers of db/db and STZ-induced diabetic mice (Fig. 1A). The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was significantly higher only in livers of STZ-induced type 1 diabetic mice (Fig. 1A). Differences in ERK1/2 phosphorylation between db/db mice and their controls were not observed (p > 0.05; Fig. 1A). Consistent with a prior study (27Ozcan U. Cao Q. Yilmaz E. Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Ozdelen E. Tuncman G. Gorgun C. Glimcher L.H. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2004; 306: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar), JNK activity was significantly increased in the livers of db/db mice (p < 0.05; Fig. 1B). In addition, there was a trend toward increased JNK activity in the livers of STZ-induced diabetic mice (p = 0.115; Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data indicate that p38 is the only MAP kinase that is activated in the livers of both type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice.TABLE 1Body weight and fasting blood glucose concentrations of miceCon1/db/dbCon2/STZBody weight (g)20.58 ± 1.49/37.63 ± 2.30ap < 0.05 vs. corresponding control. n = 6 for each group.21.53 ± 0.81/19.85 ± 0.78Fasting blood glucose (mg/dl)164.8 ± 24.36/442.3 ± 35.6ap < 0.05 vs. corresponding control. n = 6 for each group.177.5 ± 18.7/460.5 ± 43.10ap < 0.05 vs. corresponding control. n = 6 for each group.a p < 0.05 vs. corresponding control. n = 6 for each group. Open table in a new tab C/EBPα is a key transcriptional regulator of PEPCK and G6Pase and thus hepatic gluconeogenesis (8Flodby P. Barlow C. Kylefjord H. Ahrlund-Richter L. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol.

We therefore conducted the following studies to verify whether C/EBPα is involved in the excessive hepatic gluconeogenesis in diabetes. The protein levels of C/EBPα in these diabetic mouse models were measured by Western blot. The results showed that the total C/EBPα protein levels in the livers were comparable between STZ-induced type 1 diabetic mice or db/db diabetic mice and their controls, respectively (p > 0.05; Fig. 1C, top panel), suggesting that diabetes does not influence transcription or translation of C/EBPα. Similar to most transcription factors, functional regulation of C/EBPα is another mechanism for controlling the transactivation activities. Several threonine and serine residues in C/EBPα are phosphorylated by protein kinase C or glycogen synthase kinase 3 (25Ross S.E. Radomska H.S. Wu B. Zhang P. Winnay J.N. Bajnok L. Wright W.S.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation of C/EBPα appears to increase or decrease its transactivation activity (25Ross S.E. Radomska H.S. Wu B. Zhang P. Winnay J.N. Bajnok L. Wright W.S. Schaufele F. Tenen D.G. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 28Mahoney C.W. Shuman J. McKnight S.L. Chen H.C. Huang K.P. J. Biol.

A recent study demonstrated that serine 21 residue of C/EBPα can be directly phosphorylated by ERK1/2 in adipocytes (25Ross S.E. Radomska H.S. Wu B. Zhang P. Winnay J.N. Bajnok L. Wright W.S. Schaufele F. Tenen D.G. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The above results indicate that some MAP kinase pathways are activated in the livers of diabetic mice. Thus, we measured the phosphorylation status of C/EBPα by Western blot using anti-phospho-C/EBPα (Thr222/226) or anti-phospho-C/EBPα (Ser21) antibody (Cell Signaling) and the nuclear extract protein samples. As shown in Fig. 1C, the phosphorylation of C/EBPα at serine 21 was significantly increased in both db/db and STZ-induced type 1 diabetic mice compared with their control, respectively (p < 0.05; Fig. 1C). In contrast, significant changes were not observed in phosphorylation of C/EBPα on threonine 222 and 226 in livers from these diabetic mice (data not shown). In following sections, phosphorylation of C/EBPα refers to serine 21 phosphorylation. Activation of p38 MAP Kinase Increases PEPCK Gene Expression—Studies have suggested that activation of p38 contributes to hyperglycemia by increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis (21Cheong J. Coligan J.E.

Chem. 2005; 280: 42731-42737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Our study revealed that there is a positive correlation between p38 phosphorylation and PEPCK mRNA levels in livers of db/db and STZ-induced diabetic mice (data not shown). Next we conducted the following in vitro studies to investigate whether activation of p38 increases PEPCK gene expression in FAO rat hepatoma cells, which are an established model for studying gluconeogenesis (24Shao J. Qiao L. Janssen R.C. Pagliassotti M. Friedman J.E. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G.

Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Activation of p38 was induced with anisomycin or the p38 upstream kinase MKK6. PEPCK mRNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR. Anisomycin is a reagent that activates both p38 and JNK pathways. Therefore, a p38- or JNK-specific inhibitor was used to establish specificity. The results showed that a 2-h treatment with anisomycin (1 μg/ml) increased PEPCK mRNA nearly 2-fold (p < 0.05; Fig. 2A). Although addition of the p38 inhibitor (SB203580) almost completely abolished the increase in anisomycin-induced PEPCK mRNA, the JNK inhibitor (SP600126) had no effect (Fig. 2A), indicating that induction of PEPCK was mediated specifically by p38. To confirm these results, we used a constitutively active MKK6, which selectively activates p38. As shown in Fig. 2B, ectopic expression of MKK6(Glu) and p38α increased PEPCK mRNA levels significantly compared with cells transfected with the empty vector pcDNA alone (p < 0.05; Fig. 2B). Although overexpression of p38α tended to increase expression of PEPCK mRNA, the differences were not statistically significant (data not shown). However, ectopic expression of MKK6(Glu) alone increased PEPCK mRNA (Fig. 2B, second column), indicating that activation of p38 rather than expression of p38 is important for regulating transcription of PEPCK. Consistent with the important role of PEPCK in gluconeogenesis, we also observed that FAO cells that are treated with anisomycin or that express MKK6(Glu) and p38α have elevated production of glucose (data not shown). Taken together, these studies further support the hypothesis that activation of p38 increases PEPCK gene expression and hepatic glucose production. p38 MAP Kinase Phosphorylates C/EBPα at Serine 21 in Liver Cells—To determine whether C/EBPα plays a role in the induction of PEPCK gene expression by p38, the following studies were conducted. Initially we studied the effects of p38 activation on C/EBPα gene expression and found that activation of p38 with anisomycin or with coexpression of MKK6(Glu) and p38α does not alter the C/EBPα gene expression in FAO cells (Fig. 3, A–C). We next studied the effects of p38 activation on C/EBPα phosphorylation in FAO cells. As showed in Fig. 3A, anisomycin robustly increased C/EBPα phosphorylation at the serine 21 site. Because anisomycin can activate both p38 and JNK, a specific inhibitor for either p38 or JNK was employed to distinguish which pathway is responsible for the C/EBPα phosphorylation. Although the addition of a p38-specific inhibitor (SB203580) completely abolished anisomycin-stimulated C/EBPα phosphorylation, the JNK inhibitor (SP600126) did not influence C/EBPα phosphorylation (Fig. 3A, last two lanes). These data suggest that activation of p38, but not JNK, increases C/EBPα phosphorylation. We also conducted a time course study to investigate the correlation between p38 activation and C/EBPα phosphorylation. As expected, anisomycin quickly activated p38, which was measured by Western blot using anti-phospho-p38 antibody (Fig. 3B). Importantly, phosphorylation of C/EBPα closely paralleled activation of p38 (Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation of p38 and C/EBPα was robustly induced after 10 min of anisomycin treatment and reached a peak at 30 min. Although overexpression of p38α alone did not increase C/EBPα phosphorylation (data not shown), in our transient transfection studies, overexpression of MKK6(Glu) and WT p38α robustly increased the phosphorylation of C/EBPα (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data provide strong support for the hypothesis that activation of p38 induces C/EBPα phosphorylation in hepatoma cells. It is known that insulin is a strong activator of ERK and other MAP kinases in liver cells (14Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.-E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). Thus, we treated FAO cells with insulin for the indicated times (Fig. 3D) and observed that although insulin treatment increased ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation, there was no effect on activation of p38. Phosphorylation of C/EBPα was also not altered by insulin treatment (Fig. 3D). Similar results were also observed in HepG2 and H4IIE cells (data not shown). These studies suggest that neither ERK1/2 nor JNK MAP kinase phosphorylates C/EBPα at serine 21 in these hepatocytes. Together, these results indicate that p38 MAP kinase stimulates C/EBPα phosphorylation at the serine 21 residue in FAO cells. Phosphorylation of C/EBPα Increases Transcriptional Activity and Increases PEPCK Gene Transcription—The preceding results demonstrate that activation of p38 increases C/EBPα phosphorylation and PEPCK gene expression in FAO cells. We next tested whether phosphorylation of C/EBPα enhances its transactivation activity and mediates p38-induced PEPCK gene expression. In the first study, plasmids encoding wild type C/EBPα (C/EBPαWT), C/EBPαWT in which serine 21 is mutated to aspartate (C/EBPαS21D; mimics phosphorylation), or alanine (C/EBPαS21A; mimics dephosphorylation) were transfected into FAO cells. Transfection and expression efficiency is illustrated in Fig. 4A (top panel). The 42-kDa isoform was predominantly expressed in cells transfected with these plasmids. As expected, overexpression of wild type C/EBPα significantly increased PEPCK mRNA levels (p < 0.05; Fig. 4A). Ectopic expression of C/EBPαS21A also increased PEPCK mRNA (p < 0.05; Fig. 4A), suggesting that the absence of serine 21 phosphorylation of expressed C/EBPα does not reduce its transactivation activity. This result is consistent with a previous observation in other types of cells (25Ross S.E. Radomska H.S. Wu B. Zhang P. Winnay J.N. Bajnok L. Wright W.S. Schaufele F. Tenen D.G. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of C/EBPαS21D increased the PEPCK mRNA level further (Fig. 4A). Because C/EBPα is a transcription factor mediating cAMP-induced PEPCK gene transcription (32Crosson S.M. Roesler W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and p38 is a component of the cAMP signaling cascade (23Cao W. Collins Q.F. Becker T.C. Robidoux J. Lupo Jr., E.G. Xiong Y. Daniel K.W. Floering L. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42731-42737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we treated transfected cells with dibutyryl cAMP to determine whether phosphorylation of C/EBPα increases cAMP-stimulated PEPCK transcription. The cAMP-induced PEPCK mRNA levels were significantly higher in cells expressing C/EBPαS21D than in cells transfected with plasmid encoding wild type C/EBPα (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that phosphorylation of C/EBPα at serine 21 increases basal and cAMP-induced PEPCK gene expression. Using a PEPCK promoter reporter gene assay, we studied the effects of p38 activation and C/EBPα phosphorylation on PEPCK promoter activity. We employed HepG2 cells, which are human hepatoma cells and are a well characterized model for studying regulation of PEPCK promoter activity (33Liu J.S. Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19095-19102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Vander Kooi B.T. Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Oeser J.K. Powell D.R. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11782-11793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although expression of p38α alone did not alter PEPCK promoter activity, activation of p38 by cotransfection with MKK6(Glu) increased PEPCK promoter activity slightly (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, coexpression of p38α and MKK6(Glu) increased the effect of C/EBPα by over 2-fold (Fig. 5A), suggesting that C/EBPα is involved in p38-induced PEPCK gene transcription. Furthermore, this synergistic effect of p38α, MKK6(Glu), and C/EBPα on PEPCK promoter-directed luciferase expression suggests that p38 MAP kinase may increase PEPCK promoter activity by inducing C/EBPα phosphorylation. To study the effects of C/EBPα phosphorylation on its transactivation activity, we cotransfected the PEPCK promoter-reporter gene with plasmids encoding WT or mutant C/EBPα into HepG2 cells. Although overexpression of wild type C/EBPα or C/EBPαS21A increased luciferase activity ∼6-fold (p < 0.001; Fig. 5B), luciferase activities were induced almost 12-fold in cells transfected expressing C/EBPαS21D, which mimics phosphorylation at serine 21 (p < 0.001; Fig. 5B). These studies strongly suggest that phosphorylation of C/EBPα at serine 21 increases C/EBPα transactivation activity and increases PEPCK gene transcription. Excessive hepatic glucose production is an important contributor to hyperglycemia in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Although hepatic insulin resistance is causal, the mechanisms underlying excessive hepatic glucose production remain poorly understood. In this study, we report that p38 is activated in the livers of both type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice. We demonstrate that activation of p38 induces C/EBPα phosphorylation at serine 21. Furthermore, phosphorylation of C/EBPα enhances its transactivation activity in the context of PEPCK gene transcription. Therefore, we propose that C/EBPα mediates p38-stimulated PEPCK transcription in liver cells. Development of diabetes and diabetic complications has been associated with stress and inflammation. For example, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly from adipose tissue of obese mice or humans, has been linked with the deterioration of insulin sensitivity (12Wellen K.E. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (3225) Google Scholar, 35Lyon C.J. Law R.E. Hsueh W.A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2195-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In addition, chronic hyperglycemia is a typical metabolic stress that promotes the development of diabetic complications (12Wellen K.E. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (3225) Google Scholar, 35Lyon C.J. Law R.E. Hsueh W.A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2195-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). A study from Arkan et al. (13Arkan M.C. Hevener A.L. Greten F.R. Maeda S. Li Z.W. Long J.M. Wynshaw-Boris A. Poli G. Olefsky J. Karin M. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar) provides evidence supporting the notion that inflammation underlies the metabolic disorders of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The study demonstrates that IκB kinase β acts locally in liver and systemically in myeloid cells, where NF-κB activation induces inflammatory mediators that cause insulin resistance. A recent study reported that endoplasmic reticulum stress activates JNK in the livers of ob/ob diabetic and high fat diet-induced obese mice (27Ozcan U. Cao Q. Yilmaz E. Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Ozdelen E. Tuncman G. Gorgun C. Glimcher L.H. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2004; 306: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). The study also indicated that hyperactivated JNK increases insulin receptor substrate 1 serine phosphorylation and protein degradation, which leads to insulin resistance (27Ozcan U. Cao Q. Yilmaz E. Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Ozdelen E. Tuncman G. Gorgun C. Glimcher L.H. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2004; 306: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies from Pagliassotti and co-workers (37Wei Y. Pagliassotti M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E926-E933Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 38Wang D. Wei Y. Schmoll D.

Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.-E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). The activation of p38 by hyperglycemia or elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines has been reported in a variety of tissues from diabetic human subjects and animal models (16Gum R.J. Gaede L.L.

Studies have indicated that p38 activation enhances expression of PEPCK in both hepatocytes and kidney cells (21Cheong J. Coligan J.E. Shuman J.D. J. Biol.

Our current study provides further evidence demonstrating that activated p38 enhances PEPCK expression and hepatic gluconeogenesis. Together, these results suggest that hyperactivated p38 in the livers of diabetic mice contributes to hyperglycemia by increasing hepatic glucose production. Available information suggests that several transcription factors or coactivators mediate p38-induced PEPCK gene expression. ATF2 and PGC-1α have been identified as mediators of p38 in liver or kidney cells (21Cheong J. Coligan J.E. Shuman J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22714-22718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Cao W. Collins Q.F. Becker T.C. Robidoux J. Lupo Jr., E.G. Xiong Y. Daniel K.W. Floering L.

Our study provides an additional mechanism by which p38 induces PEPCK gene transcription in liver cells, adding C/EBPα as a new mediator. Our study demonstrated that C/EBPα mediates p38-induced PEPCK gene transcription in a similar fashion as PGC-1α and ATF2. Therefore, hyperactivated p38 in the livers of diabetes enhances C/EBPα, PGC-1α, and ATF2 transactivation activity, which may communally enhance PEPCK gene expression and increase hepatic glucose production. The activation of these transcription factors or coactivator as well as PEPCK transcription also imply that p38 increases hepatic glucose production directly through regulation of gene transcription. Therefore, metabolic and inflammatory stress induces excessive hepatic glucose production not only by JNK-induced insulin resistance but also through a p38-enhanced gluconeogenic enzyme transcription. C/EBPα plays a pivotal role in regulating hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression and hepatic glucose production (5Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1705-1715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 8Flodby P. Barlow C. Kylefjord H. Ahrlund-Richter L. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6014-6022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether and how C/EBPα is involved in the development of excessive hepatic glucose production in diabetes. The C/EBPα protein levels are comparable in the liver between diabetic mice and their controls, suggesting that a functional alteration may be involved (11Qiao L. Maclean P.S. You H. Schaack J. Shao J. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 3060-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). C/EBPα transactivation activity can be regulated by covalent modifications such as phosphorylation or acetylation (25Ross S.E. Radomska H.S. Wu B. Zhang P. Winnay J.N. Bajnok L. Wright W.S.

Our current study demonstrated that p38 can induce C/EBPα phosphorylation at serine 21 and that the phosphorylation increases its transactivation activity in the context of PEPCK gene transcription. Therefore, we propose that C/EBPα contributes to the development of excessive hepatic glucose production by increasing transactivation activity. Interestingly, phosphorylation of serine 21 of C/EBPα does not alter the DNA binding affinity, it does change conformation of the C/EBPα protein (25Ross S.E. Radomska H.S. Wu B. Zhang P. Winnay J.N.

Whereas the TEM-1 and SHV-1 β-lactamases are almost structurally identical, BLIP binds TEM-1 ∼1000-fold tighter than SHV-1. Determining the underlying source of this affinity difference is important for understanding the molecular basis of β-lactamase inhibition and mechanisms of protein-protein interface specificity and affinity. Here we present the 1.6Å resolution crystal structure of SHV-1 ·BLIP. In addition, a point mutation was identified, SHV D104E, that increases SHV ·BLIP binding affinity from micromolar to nanomolar. Comparison of the SHV-1 ·BLIP structure with the published TEM-1 ·BLIP structure suggests that the increased volume of Glu-104 stabilizes a key binding loop in the interface. Solution of the 1.8Å SHV D104K ·BLIP crystal structure identifies a novel conformation in which this binding loop is removed from the interface. Using these structural data, we evaluated the ability of EGAD, a program developed for computational protein design, to calculate changes in the stability of mutant β-lactamase ·BLIP complexes. Changes in binding affinity were calculated within an error of 1.6 kcal/mol of the experimental values for 112 mutations at the TEM-1 ·BLIP interface and within an error of 2.2 kcal/mol for 24 mutations at the SHV-1 ·BLIP interface.

Class A β-lactamases are a major cause of β-lactam resistance in Gram-negative bacteria.

Its binding partners include Escherichia coli TEM-1, Klebsiella pneumoniae SHV-1, Serratia marcescens SME-1, Bacillus anthracis BlaI, and Proteus vulgaris K1, among others. BLIP is able to inhibit K1 with picomolar affinity and TEM-1, SME-1, and BlaI with nanomolar affinity. However, it inhibits SHV-1 with only micromolar affinity (1Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Johns K.

Whereas SHV-1 shares 67% sequence identity with TEM-1 (Fig. 1), and the crystal structures of the unbound β-lactamases overlay with an α-carbon r.m.s. deviation of 1.4 Å, BLIP exhibits a 1000-fold difference in affinity for the two (3Kuzin A.P.

This poses an interesting question of binding specificity and affinity. How does BLIP bind multiple targets, and what is the source of variation in binding affinity? Recent alanine scanning mutagenesis has provided insight into the origins of BLIP affinity and specificity for an array of β-lactamases, including TEM-1 and SHV-1 (2Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol.

However, interpretation of these data has been limited, because only the structure of the TEM-1 ·BLIP complex has been solved by x-ray crystallography (5Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M.

Alanine-scanning mutagenesis and comparison of unbound crystal structures suggested that class A β-lactamase residue 104 (Ambler numbering system) (6Ambler R.P. Coulson A.F. Frère J.M. Ghuysen J.M.

It has been hypothesized that the reduced volume of aspartate disrupts the interfacial salt bridge seen between Glu-104TEM-1 and Lys-74BLIP and moves the carboxylate group of Asp-104SHV-1 closer to Glu-73BLIP, introducing an electrostatic clash (2Zhang Z.

By contrast, we found that the analogous D104K mutation in SHV has little effect on binding affinity (582 nm for SHV D104K ·BLIP versus 1252 nm for SHV-1 ·BLIP), and the D104E mutation increases affinity to 1.1 nm (Table 1). To understand the basis of these affinity differences, we solved the structures of the SHV-1 ·BLIP and SHV D104K ·BLIP complexes to 1.6 and 1.8 Å, respectively (Table 2).TABLE 1Summary of β-lactamase·BLIP Kd determinations for β-lactamase position 104 mutantsMutationTEM-1·BLIP KdSHV-1·BLIP KdnmnmnmGlu-1040.32 ± 0.031.1 ± 0.1Asp-104ND1252 ± 52Lys-104140 ± 5aValue from Ref. 7.582 ± 42a Value from Ref. 7Petrosino J.

In turn, by understanding the physical forces involved in protein complex formation, the design of tight binding protein partners with desired specificities should become feasible. The TEM-1 ·BLIP interface has already been demonstrated to be an excellent system for dissecting and reengineering protein-protein interactions; both the Schreiber and Tidor groups (8Joughin B.A. Green D.F. Tidor B. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1363-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Selzer T. Albeck S. Schreiber G. Nat. Struct.

Genet. 2001; 45: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have examined the effects of electrostatic interactions on the stability of this complex. To further interpret the mutational data in the context of structure, we used EGAD, our protein design algorithm, to calculate changes in binding affinity for an extensive set of experimentally characterized TEM-1 ·BLIP and SHV-1 ·BLIP mutants (2Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42860-42866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 7Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol.

This energy function was previously shown to predict relative affinities for a large set of protein interface mutational data, including a reduced set of TEM-1 mutants, correctly (15Pokala N. Handel T. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 203-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The present calculations extend this work to a larger set of TEM-1 ·BLIP mutations as well as to the SHV-1 ·BLIP interface. The reasonable success of these predictions indicates that EGAD can be used to guide further mutational analysis of the β-lactamase ·BLIP complexes, including creation of tighter binding variants. Whereas the β-lactamase ·BLIP complexes were chosen as model systems, a combined approach of structural, computational, and mutagenic techniques is emerging as a powerful method for engineering protein variants with potential for medical and other scientific applications. Cloning and Protein Purification—The blaSHV gene cloned into pBC SK(-) phagemid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to construct the blaD104K and blaD104E variants of SHV-1 β-lactamase (16Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Bonomo R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Rice L.B. Carias L.L. Hujer A.M. Bonafede M. Hutton R. Hoyen C. Bonomo R.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The blaD104E mutation was created in pBC SK(-), whereas the blaD104K variant was subcloned into pET-24a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). Mutagenesis was then performed at position 104 using the QuikChange · site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). SHV-1 and SHV D104E were expressed in pBC SK(-)in E. coli DH10B cells grown overnight, without induction. SHV D104K was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells by induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 = 0.8 for 3 h at 37 °C. For all enzymes, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C and frozen overnight. β-Lactamase was liberated using stringent periplasmic fractionation with lysozyme and EDTA as previously described (18Lin S. Thomas M. Shlaes D.M. Rudin S.D. Knox J.R. V A. Bonomo R.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Preparative isoelectric focusing was performed with a Sephadex granulated gel and ampholines in the pH range of 3.5-10 (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with 20 mm diethanolamine buffer, pH 8.3. An additional HPLC purification step was performed on a Waters high pressure liquid chromatograph using a Sephadex Hi Load 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). This expression and purification scheme yielded ∼10 mg of pure protein/liter of culture for SHV-1 and SHV D104E and 1 mg for SHV D104K. TEM-1 cloned into pET24a(+) with a N-terminal OmpA secretion signal was provided by Stéphane Gagné (Université Laval). TEM-1 was expressed and purified as in Ref. 19Sosa-Peinado A. Mustafi D. Makinen M.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar. The BLIP construct was a generous gift from Susan Jensen (University of Alberta). The BLIP bli gene was cloned into pET26b (Novagen, Madison, WI), with the native S. clavuligeris signal sequence at the N terminus. BLIP was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells by inducing with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 = 0.5 for 3 h at 30°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 g/100 ml sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and incubated for 15 min. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 5 mm MgCl2. After centrifugation at 7,000 rpm for 10 min, the periplasmic fraction was retained, and a Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) was added. That fraction was subsequently clarified by additional centrifugation and loaded onto a HiPrep 16/10 Q-XL anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 1 mm EDTA. A 250-ml gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl was used to isolate BLIP, which elutes at ∼150 mm NaCl. Fractions were pooled and concentrated to a final volume of ∼2 ml and subsequently passed through a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 preparation grade gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 100 mm NaCl. After purification, BLIP was concentrated to 1 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C. This expression and purification scheme yielded roughly 0.5 mg of pure protein/liter of culture. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Solution—SHV-1 or SHV D104K was mixed 1:1 with BLIP in 20 mm BisTris, pH 7.25, 50 mm NaCl, concentrated to 8.7 mg/ml, and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm BisTris, pH 7.25, 50 mm NaCl. Crystals were grown at 19 °C in microbatch format under Al's oil (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) by mixing 1 μl of protein with 1 μl of well solution. The SHV-1 ·BLIP crystals were grown in a well solution of 60% ammonium sulfate, 50 mm cacodylate, pH 6.5; SHV D104K ·BLIP crystals were grown in a well solution of 8% polyethylene glycol 8000, 50 mm cacodylate, pH 6.5. For harvesting, a cryoprotectant solution containing well solution plus 25% glycerol for SHV-1 ·BLIP or well solution plus 30% xylitol for SHV D104K ·BLIP was added directly to the drop, and the crystals were immediately looped and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data sets were collected on Beamline 8.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (20MacDowell A.A. Celestre R.S. Howells M. McKinney W. Krupnick J. Cambie D.

Synchrotron Radiat. 2004; 11: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A preliminary 2.1 Å data set for SHV-1 ·BLIP was collected on an R-Axis IV++ at the University of California Berkeley (Rigaku/MSC, The Woodlands, TX). Data were indexed and reduced with HKL2000 (21Otwinowksi Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar) or ELVES (22Holton J. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1537-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) using MOSFLM (23Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar). For the 1.8 Å high resolution SHV-1 ·BLIP structure, molecular replacement was performed using a partially refined structure from the 2.1 Å data set. Initial maps for the SHV D104K ·BLIP structure were generated by molecular replacement with PHASER (24Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) using polyalanine models of SHV-1 (coordinates taken from Protein Data Bank entry 1SHV) and BLIP (coordinates taken from Protein Data Bank entry 1JTG) (3Kuzin A.P.

Uppsala Software Factory, Uppsala, Sweden1997Google Scholar). Refinement was carried out with Refmac (26Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using ARP to automatically place ordered waters, followed by TLS refinement (27Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Additional details of the data collection and refinement are provided in Table 2. Structural alignments and r.m.s. deviations were calculated with LSQMAN (28Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EACBM News-letter Protein Crystallogr. 1994; 31: 9-14Google Scholar). All molecular figures were created with PyMOL (29DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Inhibition Assays—All kinetic determinations were performed using nitrocefin (BD Biosciences) as the indicator substrate to measure hydrolysis rates of SHV-1, SHV D104K, SHV D104E, and TEM-1 β-lactamases with and without inhibitor. BLIP and lactamase were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 10 mm sodium phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Initially, 7 nm enzyme was used for all assays, but this was reduced to 4 nm for SHV D104E and 2nm for TEM-1 to obtain an accurate measurement of the low Kd values. Reactions were initiated with nitrocefin at the Km for the enzyme (25 μm for SHV-1, 15 μm for SHV D104K, 25 μm for SHV D104E, and 150 μm for TEM-1). Final reaction volumes were 1 ml. All measurements were performed in triplicate. Hydrolysis rates were determined at λ = 482 nm using the extinction coefficient, ϵ = 17,400 m-1 cm-1 for the hydrolyzed form of nitrocefin (30O'Callaghan C. Morris A. Kirby S. Shingler A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1972; 1: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar). BLIP inhibition curves were graphed using Origin · 7.5 SR software and fit to the following equation, Efree=[E0]−[E0]+[I0]+Kd∗−([E0]+[I0]+Kd∗)2−(4[E0][I0])2(Eq. 1) where Efree represents the remaining free enzyme concentration calculated based on activity, [E0] is initial enzyme concentration, [I0] is the concentration of BLIP, and Kd* is the apparent equilibrium constant (7Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Kd* was corrected for the presence of substrate using the following equation.Kd=Kd*(1+[S]/Km)(Eq. 2) Computational Calculation of Free Energies of Dissociation—EGAD_lib, 7A. Chowdry, K. A. Reynolds, M. S. Voorhies, M. S. Hanes, N. Pokala, and T. M. Handel, manuscript in preparation. a C++ implementation of the EGAD protein design energy function, was employed to calculate dissociation free energies of the complexes (15Pokala N. Handel T. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 203-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 31Pokala N. Handel T.M. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The function consists of an OPLS-AA derived force field (32Jorgensen W.L. Maxwell D.S. Tirado-Rives J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11225-11236Crossref Scopus (10145) Google Scholar) alongside a solvent-accessible surface area term and the generalized Born model to describe solvation. The force field terms include a linearized van der Waals (vdW) potential, a coulombic electrostatics term, and a torsional potential. Minimization was conducted using Monte Carlo simulated annealing followed by a heuristic quench step (15Pokala N. Handel T. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 203-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). An initial model for the bound state of the complex was created by rotamer optimization of the corresponding crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1JTG for TEM-1 ·BLIP, Protein Data Bank code 2G2U for SHV-1 ·BLIP, or Protein Data Bank code 2G2W for SHV D104K ·BLIP) (45Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26227) Google Scholar). The unbound state model was generated by separating the two chains in the complex by 25 Å, followed by rotamer optimization of each. For these complexes, calculations performed with the rotamer-optimized initial model were not significantly different from those using the Protein Data Bank structure directly. Typically, we use initial rotamer optimization in interface calculations as a precaution against improperly refined rotamers, although the high resolution of the β-lactamase ·BLIP structures makes this step less important. The free energy of dissociation is defined as the energy difference between the complex and free states.ΔGd=ΔGbound-ΔGfree(Eq. 3) The free energy used for comparison with experimental values is as follows.ΔΔGd,mut=η(ΔGd,mut-ΔGd,WT)(Eq. 4) Here η is a scaling factor used to normalize the predicted changes in binding affinity to have a slope of 1 when compared with the experimental energy changes (15Pokala N. Handel T. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 203-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For ΔΔGd, mut calculated with the TEM-1 ·BLIP backbone coordinates, η = 0.18; for both SHV-1 ·BLIP and SHV D104K ·BLIP, η = 0.30. The mutant free energies were calculated by rotamer optimization of the mutant structures, allowing only a reduced set of positions to move during optimization. This set was restricted to residues at the interface (residues that undergo a change in solvent-accessible surface area upon binding) and their neighbors. Structure of the SHV-1 ·BLIP Complex—The structure of the SHV-1 ·BLIP complex is globally similar to that of TEM-1 ·BLIP; alignment of the α-carbon atoms of TEM-1 and SHV-1 yields an r.m.s. deviation of 0.44 Å between the two β-lactamases and an r.m.s. deviation of 1.04 Å between the associated BLIPs (Fig. 2). Alignment of all α-carbon atoms yields an overall r.m.s. deviation of 0.61 Å for the two complexes. As in the TEM-1 complex, the concave β-sheet region of BLIP latches onto a protruding loop-helix region of SHV-1 (residues 99-112), and two loops of BLIP insert into the β-lactamase active site. Residues Asp-49 (at the end of the first loop) and Phe-142 (at the end of the second loop) form an approximate mimic of the β-lactamase substrate, penicillin G (5Strynadka N.C.J. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Comparison of the bound and unbound forms of SHV-1 reveals only minimal global changes in conformation upon binding, with the exception of the H10 helix (residues 218-230) (Fig. 3). In the SHV-1 ·BLIP structure, the H10 helix partially unravels at the N terminus, assuming a structure similar to the H10 helix as observed in both the bound and unbound forms of TEM-1. The H10 helix conformation in the crystal of unbound SHV-1 is possibly affected by proximal binding of a detergent molecule, Cymal-6 (3Kuzin A.P. Nukaga M. Nukaga Y. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5720-5727Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Previously, it was observed that the conformation of the H10 helix interacting with detergent in the SHV-1 unbound structure was similar to the conformational change seen when TEM-1 interacts with an allosteric cryptic site inhibitor (33Horn J.R. Shoichet B.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Conformational change of the H10 helix. The H10 helix of SHV-1 assumes an alternate conformation in the BLIP bound structure (shown in bright green). Here it is compared with the H10 helix of unbound SHV-1 in dark blue and of TEM-1 in orange. The conformation of the H10 helix is identical in both TEM-1 bound and unbound. The backbone coordinates of TEM-1 (in gray) bound to BLIP (in red) are shown for reference.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The question then remains, what features are responsible for the differential affinity of BLIP for TEM-1 versus SHV-1? There are eight SHV-1 residues within6Åof BLIP that differ in identity from TEM-1 (Fig. 1A). These include R98S, Q100N, D104E, A114T, S133T, T167P, R215K, and T235S (here the residue identity in SHV-1 is listed first). Comparison of the hydrogen bond, salt bridge, and vdW interactions of these residues in the TEM-1 ·BLIP and SHV-1 ·BLIP complexes provides some structural insight. EGAD was used to quantify the extent of vdW contact. Pairwise vdW energies were calculated between all interface residues, and those providing stabilizing interactions in excess of -1.0 kcal/mol are tabulated in supplemental Table 2. A combination of the REDUCE and BndList programs was used to detect hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (34Word J.M. Lovell S.C. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1735-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table 1). In a few cases, the SHV-1 residue type contributes new interactions: Arg-98SHV has improved vdW packing with Trp-150BLIP relative to Ser-98TEM, and Arg-215SHV forms two hydrogen bonds with Glu-31BLIP, whereas Lys-215TEM forms only one. For positions 133 and 235, there is little difference between the TEM-1 and SHV-1 residues; S133T makes few interfacial contacts in SHV-1 or TEM-1, and Thr-235SHV forms a hydrogen bond with Asp-49BLIP analogous to that formed by Ser-235TEM. However, for the remaining four residue differences, TEM-1 forms more extensive interactions across the interface. The backbone carbonyls of Gln-100SHV and Asn-100TEM both form a hydrogen bond with Arg-160BLIP, although Asn-100TEM is able to form more extensive vdW contacts with Trp-150BLIP and Arg-160BLIP (Fig. 1B). Thr-114TEM exhibits improved vdW interactions with Tyr-115BLIP in comparison with Ala-114SHV (Fig. 1C), and Pro-167TEM forms more extensive contacts with Trp-162BLIP; however, Thr-167SHV does provide increased vdW interactions with Phe-142BLIP (Fig. 1D). The reduced volume of Asp-104SHV eliminates the interfacial salt bridge between Glu-104TEM and Lys-74BLIP. A hydrogen bonding interaction between Glu-104TEM and the Tyr-143BLIP backbone is not formed with Asp-104SHV, favorable vdW packing interactions between Glu-104TEM and Phe-142BLIP are entirely eliminated in the SHV-1 ·BLIP interface, and the packing between Asp-104SHV and Tyr-143BLIP is significantly reduced relative to Glu-104TEM (Fig. 1E). These dramatic changes between position 104 in SHV-1 compared with TEM-1 suggest that it might be a particularly important hot spot in the interface. Mutagenesis of SHV Position 104—The substitution of aspartate in SHV-1 for glutamate in TEM-1 at position 104 shortens the side chain by a single carbon, yet a number of interactions across the β-lactamase ·BLIP interface are eliminated. The loss of the Glu-104TEM and Lys-74BLIP salt bridge results in the energetically unfavorable burial of unsatisfied charges at the interface. The extensive contacts removed between position 104 and the Phe-142 loop are consistent with previous mutational data indicating that Phe-142TEM is a hot spot at the TEM-1 ·BLIP interface, whereas Phe-142SHV appears to have a reduced role in the SHV-1 ·BLIP interface (2Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Bio"

Longitudinal studies in both developed and developing countries and better measurements of adolescent behavior are producing new insights. The physical and psychosocial changes that occur during puberty make manifest generational and early-childhood risks to development, in the form of individual differences in aspects such as growth, educational attainment, self-esteem, peer influences, and closeness to family. They also anticipate threats to adult health and well-being. Multidisciplinary approaches, especially links between the biological and the social sciences, as well as studies of socioeconomic and cultural diversity and determinants of positive outcomes, are needed to advance knowledge about this stage of development."

https://openalex.org/W2009775982,"Tat, the HIV transactivating protein, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of extracellular matrix (ECM) endopeptidases, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated dementia. However, the possibility that MMPs interact with viral proteins has remained unexplored. We therefore treated mixed human fetal neuronal cultures with recombinant Tat and select MMPs. Neurotoxicity was determined by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential and neuronal cell death. Previous studies have shown that Tat and MMP independently cause neurotoxicity. Surprisingly, we found the combination of Tat and MMP produced significant attenuation of neurotoxicity. To determine whether there was a physical interaction between Tat and MMP, we used protein electrophoresis and Western blot techniques, and found that MMP-1 can degrade Tat. This effect was blocked by MMP inhibitors. Furthermore, MMP-1 decreased Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV long terminal repeat region, and this functionality was restored when MMP-1 activity was inhibited. These results suggest that the decrease in Tat-induced neurotoxicity and HIV transactivation is due to Tat's enzymatic cleavage by MMP-1. The direct interaction of human MMPs with viral proteins has now been demonstrated, with resultant modulation of Tat-mediated neurotoxicity and transactivation. This study elucidates a unique viral-host interaction that may serve as an innate host defense mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2135326690,"Organophosphate pesticides (OPs), known inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), are used extensively throughout the world. Recent studies have focused on the ACHE/PON1 locus as a determinant of inherited susceptibility to environmental OP exposure. To explore the relationship of the corresponding gene-environment interactions with brain activity, we integrated neurophysiologic, neuropsychological, biochemical, and genetic methods. Importantly, we found that subthreshold OP exposure leads to discernible physiological consequences that are significantly influenced by inherited factors. Cortical EEG analyses by LORETA revealed significantly decreased theta activity in the hippocampus, parahippocampal regions, and the cingulate cortex, as well as increased beta activity in the prefrontal cortex of exposed individuals-areas known to play a role in cholinergic-associated cognitive functions. Through neuropsychological testing, we identified an appreciable deficit in the visual recall in exposed individuals. Other neuropsychological tests revealed no significant differences between exposed and non-exposed individuals, attesting to the specificity of our findings. Biochemical analyses of blood samples revealed increases in paraoxonase and arylesterase activities and reduced serum acetylcholinesterase activity in chronically exposed individuals. Notably, specific paraoxonase genotypes were found to be associated with these exposure-related changes in blood enzyme activities and abnormal EEG patterns. Thus, gene-environment interactions involving the ACHE/PON1 locus may be causally involved in determining the physiological response to OP exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2026167664,"An enhanced metabolic efficiency for accelerating the recovery of fat mass (or catch-up fat) is a characteristic feature of body weight regulation after weight loss or growth retardation and is the outcome of an “adipose-specific” suppression of thermogenesis, i.e., a feedback control system in which signals from the depleted adipose tissue fat stores exert a suppressive effect on thermogenesis. Using a previously described rat model of semistarvation-refeeding in which catch-up fat results from suppressed thermogenesis per se,we report here that the gene expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1) is elevated in skeletal muscle after 2 wk of semistarvation and remains elevated in parallel to the phase of suppressed thermogenesis favoring catch-up fat during refeeding. These elevations in the SCD1 transcript are skeletal muscle specific and are associated with elevations in microsomal Δ9 desaturase enzyme activity, in the Δ9 desaturation index, and in the relative content of SCD1-derived monounsaturates in several lipid fractions extracted from skeletal muscle. An elevated skeletal muscle SCD1, by desaturating the products of de novo lipogenesis and diverting them away from mitochondrial oxidation, would inhibit substrate cycling between de novo lipogenesis and lipid oxidation, thereby leading to a state of suppressed thermogenesis that regulates the body's fat stores.—Mainieri, D., Summermatter, S., Seydoux, J., Montani, J.

https://openalex.org/W2111065099,"Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is responsible for the severe visual loss in age-related macular degeneration. CNV formation is considered to be due to an imbalance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors that lead to neovascular growth from the choriocapillaris into the subretinal space. To define whether FasL overexpression in retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) can inhibit choroidal neovascularization through Fas-FasL-mediated apoptosis, we examined the role of this pathway in a mouse model of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization. FasL was expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium of transgenic mice. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunoblot, and immunohistochemistry confirmed that the transgene FasL was specifically expressed in RPE. The established laser model was used to induce choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in wild-type (WT) and transgenic mice. CNV formation was compared with respect to fluorescein angiographic leakage (at days 0 and 14 after laser injury) and histological appearance. The lesions were assessed on RPE-choroidal flatmounts after CD31-labeling and with confocal microscopy after perfusion with rhodamine-labeled concanavalin A (Con A). Apoptosis was quantified by TUNEL positivity and caspase activation. FasL mRNA and protein were highly expressed in the RPE of the transgenic mice before and after laser photocoagulation. In contrast, FasL was only weakly expressed in the RPE layer of WT C57BL/6J mice. While ruptures of Bruch's membrane and CNV formation were observed histologically two weeks after laser photocoagulation in transgenic as well as control eyes, the shape and size of CNV lesions were reduced in the transgenic mice. The area of leakage was decreased by 70% in FasL transgenic mice compared with WT mice (P<0.005). The number of TUNEL-positive cells was greater in FasL-overexpressing mice and correlated with the expression of activated caspases. Th expression of other antiangiogenic factors such as PEDF remained unchanged. The specific overexpression of FasL in RPE layer reduced CNV formation in our laser model. Our results strongly point to the FasL-Fas pathway as a potential therapeutic target in controlling pathological choroidal neovascularization."
https://openalex.org/W2036786576,"Given that thousands of genes exist in the mammalian genome, criteria are needed to prioritize their functional analysis and to decrease the likelihood of producing gene-targeted mice that lack overt phenotypes. Initial analysis efforts are likely to be fruitful if focused on genes encoding large proteins, since at least some large proteins serve as frameworks for intricate assembly of protein complexes, and their inactivation would render definitive, observable phenotypes. Here, we describe the functional characterization of the murine homologues of five human KIAA genes (KIAA1409, KIAA1440, KIAA1447, KIAA1768, and KIAA1276) that encode large proteins. Gene-targeted mice had phenotypic and developmental defects resulting from the functional deletion of three of these five genes. Mice with targeted disruption of KIAA1409 lacked the ability to drink, and those with targeted disruption of KIAA1447 displayed hind leg motor dysfunction. Disruption of KIAA1440 led to embryonic lethality at the blastocyst stage. The high success rate of our approach demonstrates the rationale for the genome-wide functional examination of large proteins in mice using reverse genetics."
https://openalex.org/W2002311750,"The importance of heparan- and chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycans in physiological and pathological processes led to the investigation of the regulation of beta1,3-glucuronosyltransferase I (GlcAT-I), responsible for the completion of glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage tetrasaccharide, a key step prior to polymerization of chondroitin- and heparan-sulfate chains. We have cloned and functionally characterized GlcAT-I 5'-flanking regulatory region. Mutation analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated the importance of Sp1 motif located at -65/-56 position in promoter activity. Furthermore, we found that elevation of intracellular calcium concentration by the calcium ionophore ionomycin stimulated GlcAT-I gene expression as well as glycosaminoglycan chain synthesis in HeLa cells. Bisanthracycline, an anti-Sp1 compound, inhibited GlcAT-I basal promoter activity and suppressed ionomycin induction, suggesting the importance of Sp1 in calcium induction of GlcAT-I gene expression. Nuclear protein extracts from ionomycin-induced cells exhibited an increased DNA binding of Sp1 factor to the consensus sequence at position -65/-56. Signaling pathway analysis and MEK inhibition studies revealed the important role of p42/p44 MAPK in the stimulation of GlcAT-I promoter activity by ionomycin. The present study identifies, for the first time, GlcAT-I as a target of calcium-dependent signaling pathway and evidences the critical role of Sp1 transcription factor in the activation of GlcAT-I expression."
https://openalex.org/W2023608158,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) acts intracellularly to counteract the angiotensin (ANG) II type 1 receptor (AT1-R)-mediated chronotropic effect of ANG II in hypothalamic neurons, an effect mediated by the thiol-protein oxidoreductase (TPOR) activity of the MIF molecule. Here we determined the in vivo actions of MIF in regulating the physiological actions of ANG II that are mediated via the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), an area that serves as a relay point in the central nervous system (CNS)-mediated effects of ANG II on cardiovascular functions and water intake. Intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of ANG II into normotensive rats selectively increased MIF protein levels in the PVN and produced significant pressor and drinking responses that were inhibited by PVN administration of the AT1-R antagonist losartan. Overexpression of MIF in PVN neurons via Ad-Syn-MIF gene transfer attenuated the pressor and drinking responses produced by icv-injected ANG II. Consistently, intracellular application of MIF or MIF-(50-65) (which harbors the TPOR activity of MIF) into PVN sympathetic regulatory neurons, blunted the electrophysiological actions of ANG II at these cells. These observations establish for the first time that MIF within the PVN, acting via TPOR, is an intracellular regulator of the central cardiovascular and dipsogenic effects of ANG II."

https://openalex.org/W2009439065,"The topology of association of the monotopic protein cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) with membranes has been examined using EPR spectroscopy of spin-labeled recombinant human COX-2. Twenty-four mutants, each containing a single free cysteine substituted for an amino acid in the COX-2 membrane binding domain were expressed using the baculovirus system and purified, then conjugated with a nitroxide spin label and reconstituted into liposomes. Determining the relative accessibility of the nitroxide-tagged amino acid side chains for the solubilized COX-2 mutants, or COX-2 reconstituted into liposomes to nonpolar (oxygen) and polar (NiEDDA or CrOx) paramagnetic reagents allowed us to map the topology of COX-2 interaction with the lipid bilayer. When spin-labeled COX-2 was reconstituted into liposomes, EPR power saturation curves showed that side chains for all but two of the 24 mutants tested had limited accessibility to both polar and nonpolar paramagnetic relaxation agents, indicating that COX-2 associates primarily with the interfacial membrane region near the glycerol backbone and phospholipid head groups. Two amino acids, Phe66 and Leu67, were readily accessible to the non-polar relaxation agent oxygen, and thus likely inserted into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. However these residues are co-linear with amino acids in the interfacial region, so their extension into the hydrophobic core must be relatively shallow. EPR and structural data suggest that membrane interaction of COX-2 is also aided by partitioning of 4 aromatic amino acids, Phe59, Phe66, Tyr76, and Phe84 to the interfacial region, and by the electrostatic interactions of two basic amino acids, Arg62 and Lys64, with the phospholipid head groups.

DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2460) Google Scholar). The COXs have been studied extensively because of their essential and regulatory role in prostaglandin synthesis and also because they are the site of action of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, Ibuprofen, Naproxin, Vioxx®, and Celebrex®. COX-1 and -2 are classified as integral membrane proteins because they can be solubilized only by treatment of membranes with detergent and not with chaotropic salts. These isozymes are localized to the luminal surfaces of the endoplasmic reticulum and the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope (2Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singer II Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that that COX-1 and -2 are homodimers (3Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Each monomer contains an epidermal growth factor domain at the N terminus followed by a membrane binding domain and a large globular catalytic domain (Fig. 6A). Membrane binding domains of both COX-1 and -2 contains four short, consecutive, amphipathic α-helices (A, B, C, and D) (Fig. 6A). Crystal structures of the cyclooxygenases indicate that basic, hydrophobic, and aromatic residues in the membrane binding domain are orientated away from the protein and form a surface on the enzyme that has been proposed to interact with the lipid bilayer. Constructs containing the COX signal sequences, as well as the epidermal growth factor and membrane binding domains linked to green fluorescent protein target these chimeras to the same subcellular membranes as native enzyme (4Li Y. Smith T. Grabski S. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29830-29837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) demonstrating that the membrane binding domain is responsible for membrane association. Labeling studies with the lipid soluble 3-trifluoro-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirin suggest that the membrane binding domain penetrates the hydrophobic core of the membrane (5Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9906-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), however the topology of membrane association of the cyclooxygenases has never been determined. One method to investigate the topology of membrane proteins is site-directed spin labeling and power saturation EPR spectroscopy (6Hubbel W.L. Altenbach C. White S.H. Membrane Protein Structure: Experimental Approaches. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 224-248Crossref Google Scholar). This technique uses mutated recombinant proteins that contain a single reactive amino acid, usually cysteine, which can be conjugated with a paramagnetic spin label. Once reconstituted into liposomes these spin labels act as EPR probes that report on the environment of the modified amino acid side chain. The relative accessibility of spin label to a nonpolar spin relaxation agent (oxygen) and to water soluble polar spin relaxants (NiEDDA or CrOx) can be used to determine whether the amino acids are within the lipid bilayer, or if they are solvent accessible. EPR spectroscopy to determine the paramagnetic spin relaxant accessibility of 24 single cysteine spin-labeled COX-2 mutants reconstituted into liposomes, has allowed us to map the topology of COX-2 interaction with membranes. Materials—1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine] (Sodium Salt) (DOPS) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Oleic acid (≥ 99%) was purchased from Fluka. All restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Ni-NTA was purchased from Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). Tween®-20 (10% solution) was obtained from Pierce. The nitroxide spin label (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate (MTSSL) was purchased from Reanal Fine Chemical (Budapest, Hungary). Arachidonic acid was obtained from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). DPPH (α,α′-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl) and CrOx (potassium tris(oxalato)chromate(III)) were purchased from Sigma. NiEDDA was prepared as follows: equimolar amounts of Ni(OH)2 (464 mg) and EDDA (881 mg) were mixed in 100 ml of 50% methanol in water. The mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature and an additional 24 h at 60 °C. The resulting solution was filtered, and the solvent evaporated to give 1.12 g of blue powder that by mass spectroscopic analysis showed a single peak (m/z 231) corresponding to the molecular ion of [NiEDDA-1H]-. Construction of His-tagged and Cysteine Mutants of PGHS-2—The construction of baculoviral vectors for His-tagged human COX-2 and their expression in Sf-21 cells has been described previously (7MirAfzali Z.

Two native cysteines in COX-2 that do not form disulfide bonds (positions 299 and 526) 3The membrane binding domain is the most dissimilar region between the cyclooxygenase isozymes.

Thus, the human COX-2 amino acid sequence numbering is used in this article rather than the conventional ovine COX-1 numbering system. were mutated to serines in the histidine-tagged version of the human COX-2 protein using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Using the His-tagged C299S/C526S COX-2 as a template, individual baculovirus for the triply substituted COX-2 proteins F59C, L60C, T61C, R62C, I63C, K64C, L65C, F66C, L67C, N72C, T73C, V74C, H75C, Y76C, I77C, L78C, G83C, F84C, W85C, N86C, V87C, V88C, N89C, and N90C were created. Expression of Recombinant PGHS Protein in SF21 Insect Cells—Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) insect cells were grown in HyQ-SFX-Insect serum-free insect cell media (HyClone Logan, Utah) in 1-liter cultures at 27 °C in 2.8-liter Fernbach flasks (Bellco Biotechnology Inc., Vineland, NJ) shaken at 120 rpm. When cells reached a density of 1.5-2.0 × 106 cells/ml, baculovirus were added at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0, and the infection was allowed to proceed for 72-96 h. Cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at -80 °C. Purification of His-tagged PGHS from Baculovirus-infected Sf21 Insect Cells—The COX-2 proteins were purified using nickel affinity chromatography from SF21 cells as described previously (7MirAfzali Z. Leipprandt J.R. McCracken J.L. DeWitt D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 443: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fractions with high specific cyclooxygenase activity were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon® Ultra centrifugal filter device with a 30,000 molecular weight cutoff (Millipore) to 4 mg/ml. Cyclooxygenase protein was 80-90% pure following this step and had specific activities of ∼25,000 units/mg for the C299S/C526S COX-2 enzyme, where 1 unit equals utilization of 1 nm O2/mg/min at 37° under standard polarimetric assay conditions (7MirAfzali Z. Leipprandt J.R. McCracken J.L. DeWitt D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 443: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The various mutants had 10-100% of the activity of the C299S/C526S COX-2 enzyme (Table 1).TABLE 1Relative cyclooxygenase activities of the triply substituted hCOX-2 cysteine mutantsHis-COX-2 mutantRelative activity before conjugation with MTSSLaCyclooxygenase activity determined by oxygen electrode as described previously on purified enzyme before and after conjugation with MTSSL.

Open table in a new tab Spin Labeling—Nickel affinity-purified COX-2 (4 mg/ml) containing a single free cysteine was incubated with a 20-fold molar excess of MTSSL overnight at 4 °C. Unreacted MTSSL was removed by 4 consecutive dialyses against 4 liter of 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 containing 50 mm KCl using a Slide-A-Lyzer® dialysis unit with a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff (Pierce). The spin-labeled protein was then concentrated to 15-20 mg/ml using an Amicon® ultra centrifugal filter device with 30,000 molecular weight cutoff (Millipore). Previous spin counting studies using the nitroxide labeled H75C mutant has demonstrated 95-100% efficiency of labeling by this procedure without a noticeable decrease in the specific activity of the COX-2 (7MirAfzali Z. Leipprandt J.R. McCracken J.L. DeWitt D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 443: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Preparation of Large Unilamellar Vesicles—Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared from a mixture of DOPC: DOPS (7:3 mol/mol) and oleic acid (9.2%, w/w) (7MirAfzali Z. Leipprandt J.R. McCracken J.L. DeWitt D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 443: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the phospholipids and oleic acid in chloroform were mixed and dried under a stream of nitrogen. The phospholipid film was redissolved in 0.5 ml of hexane, and the organic solvent was removed again under a stream of nitrogen. The resulting film was hydrated in a buffer of 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 containing 50 mm KCl for 1 h at a concentration of 38 mm, then vortexed thoroughly and extruded 20 times through a 0.1-μm pore diameter polycarbonate filter using a Mini-Extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). This process produces a transparent milky suspension. Incorporation of COX into the Preformed Liposomes—Purified COX (20-30 nmol, 20 mg/ml) in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 containing 50 mm KCl was added to the preformed liposomes at a protein:phospholipid molar ratios of 1:500 in a total volume of 0.5 ml and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C (7MirAfzali Z. Leipprandt J.R. McCracken J.L. DeWitt D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 443: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were next separated from free COX-2 by a density centrifugation. The liposome suspension was combined with 1 ml of 30% (w/v) Ficoll in 25 mm Tris-Cl and 50 mm KCl, pH 7.4 to give a final concentration of 20% (w/v) Ficoll and transferred to a 5-ml ultracentrifuge tube. 3 ml of 10% (w/v) Ficoll in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 containing 50 mm KCl was layered onto the 20% Ficoll liposome suspension, and the tube was filled with 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 containing 50 mm KCl. Gradients were centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 30 min at 20 °C in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor. Liposomes and proteoliposomes band together at the interface between the 0% Ficoll and 10% Ficoll layers and were removed with a needle. Unincorporated protein remains in the lower 30% Ficoll layer. Typically 50% of the protein is incorporated into the liposomes under these conditions, and recovery of total activity in the gradient was 95-100% (7MirAfzali Z. Leipprandt J.R. McCracken J.L. DeWitt D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 443: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Gold labeling of the proteoliposomes using anti-COX-2 antibody indicates that COX-2 is homogeneous and does not aggregate when reincorporated into the liposomes (7MirAfzali Z. Leipprandt J.R. McCracken J.L. DeWitt D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 443: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For measurements with soluble paramagnetic reagents, the proteoliposome samples were added to dried CrOx or NiEDDA to achieve a final concentration of 10 or 50 mm, respectively. CW EPR Power Saturation Measurements—Continuous wave (CW) EPR spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer at room temperature (23 ± 2 °C) equipped with a two loop one gap resonator (Medical Advances, Milwaukee, WI). Samples were loaded into a gas permeable TPX capillary (Jagmar Ltd., Krakow, Poland) with total volume of 4 μl. Power saturation experiments were carried out using 2 Gauss modulation amplitude and varying microwave power (0.1-36 milliwatt). The scan range of all spectra was 100 Gauss and the final spectra were obtained by signal averaging 8, 16, or 32 scans. The peak to peak amplitude of the first derivative mI = 0 resonance line (A) was measured and plotted against the square root of the incident microwave power (Fig. 1A). The data points were then fit to Equation 1,App(0)=IP1+(2-ϵ-1)PP1/2ϵ using Microcal Origin® software (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA) (Fig. 1B). Here, I is a scaling factor, P½ is the microwave power required to reduce the resonance amplitude to half of its unsaturated value, and ϵ is a measure of the homogeneity of the saturation of the resonance. In this fit, I, ϵ, and P½ are adjustable parameters and yield a characteristic P½. Values for P½ were then generated for each sample under three different conditions: 1) equilibrated with nitrogen; 2) equilibrated with 20% oxygen (air); and 3) equilibrated with nitrogen in the presence of 10 mm CrOx or 50 mm NiEDDA. The samples were purged with gas for at least 20 min before performing each measurement. The resonator remained connected to the gas during the measurements. From these values of P½, a collision parameter for O2 (π(oxygen)) was determined according to Equation 2.Π(oxygen)=ΔP1/2(O2)P1/2(DPPH)=[P1/2(O2)-P1/2(N2)]/ΔHppP1/2(DPPH)/ΔHpp(DPPH) ΔHpp is the peak-to-peak line width for the central resonance of the EPR spectra. A similar expression can be written for π(NiEDDA) or π(CrOx), the collision parameters for NiEDDA and CrOx. P½(DPPH) and ΔHpp(DPPH) were obtained for a crystal sample of DPPH (α,α′-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl). The contrast function Φ is a variable useful for identifying residues that are lipid imbedded or in loops (8Isas J.M. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is defined in Equation 3.Φ=lnΠ(O2)Π(NiEDDA) Site-directed spin labeling requires that a protein contain only a single reactive cysteine; therefore, a cysteine-less COX-2 template was prepared by mutating to serines the two cysteines (229 and 526) that do not form disulfide bonds (9Luong C. Miler A. Barnett J. Chow J. Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). This cysteine-less template retained 70% of both cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities compared with the native COX-2, so these mutations only minimally distort the structure of the enzyme. In contrast, serine substitution of the analogous cysteines in COX-1 significantly reduces cyclooxygenase activity (10Kennedy T.A. Smith C.J. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27357-27364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cysteine-less COX-2 template also contains six histidines distal to the signal cleavage site, a modification that does not affect the activity of the enzyme and enables rapid purification (11Smith T. Leipprandt J. DeWitt D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The membrane binding domain was originally described as containing four helices (designated A-D) (3Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). However structural studies have since indicated that helix D is primarily a structural component of the cyclooxygenase active site (Fig. 6A). Thus, the twenty-four single cysteine mutants constructed for these studies were from the helices A, B, and C (Table 1). The histidine-tagged mutant proteins were expressed in sf-21 cells using baculovirus constructs and purified using nickel affinity chromatography (11Smith T. Leipprandt J. DeWitt D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All of the single cysteine mutants retained significant cyclooxygenase activities (20-70% of the native) except for the W85C, which had 10% activity (Table 1). Conjugation of the cysteines with the spin label MTSSL did not further decrease cyclooxygenase activity. Previous studies with other proteins have demonstrated that conjugation with MTSSL rarely disrupts the native structure of cysteine-substituted proteins (12McHaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). To examine the interaction of the COX-2 protein with membranes we examined three parameters: 1) the relative accessibility of nitroxide side chains of the MTSSL-conjugated, liposome-reconstituted COX-2 to nonpolar (O2) and polar (NiEDDA) paramagnetic relaxation reagents using continuous wave power saturation EPR spectroscopy to determine the local environment of helix A, B, and C amino acids; 2) the relative accessibility of the nitroxide side chains of MTSSL-conjugated solubilized, and liposome-reconstituted COX-2 to the charged polar paramagnetic relaxation agent CrOx, using continuous power saturation EPR spectroscopy, to determine how membrane association changes the accessibility of these amino acid side chains; and 3) the line width (ΔH) and hyperfine splitting of EPR spectra of the solubilized MTSSL-conjugated COX-2 mutants in 30% sucrose to determine relative side chain mobility and helix main chain dynamics. For all experiments, each of the 24 cysteine-substituted proteins was purified, conjugated with MTSSL, and concentrated (20 mg/ml, 280 μm). For proteoliposome experiments, spin-labeled COX-2 was then incorporated into preformed liposomes, and the proteoliposomes were separated from unincorporated COX-2 using a Ficoll density gradient centrifugation (7MirAfzali Z. Leipprandt J.R. McCracken J.L. DeWitt D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 443: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and loaded into gas permeable TPX capillary tubes in a total volume of 4 μl. EPR spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer at room temperature (23 ± 2 °C) equipped with a two loop one gap resonator. For power saturations experiments, peak to peak amplitude of the first derivative mI = 0 resonance line (A) was measured and plotted against the square root of the incident microwave power (Fig. 1A). Values for P½ were then generated for the spin-labeled proteoliposome equilibrated with nitrogen, the spin-labeled proteoliposome equilibrated with 20% oxygen (air), or equilibrated with nitrogen in the presence of 50 mm NiEDDA or 10 mm CROX (Fig. 1B). Continuous Wave Power Saturation EPR Spectroscopy of the Nitroxide-labeled COX-2 Reconstituted into Liposomes: Accessibilities to Oxygen and NiEDDA—The solvent exposure of a nitroxide spin label attached to a cysteine residue in a protein can be measured by examining its collision frequency with another paramagnetic reagent such as oxygen or NiEDDA. The collision frequency of a nitroxide probe with paramagnetic relaxers depends on the product of the paramagnetic species translational diffusion coefficient and local concentration. Relative collision frequencies are determined by the method of continuous wave power saturation. The increase in P½ that occurs in the presence of NiEDDA, CrOx, or air is converted into a dimensionless accessibility parameter π, which is proportional to the collision frequency of the nitroxide with the respective paramagnetic reagent (13Altenbach C. Marti T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1088-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The accessibility to soluble NiEDDA and CrOx is high for protein surface residues and low for amino acids in the protein interior and in the lipid bilayer. In contrast, oxygen is poorly soluble in aqueous solutions, but its solubility and diffusion coefficient are high in the bilayer. Oxygen is also more accessible in the protein interior than NiEDDA. When used in conjunction with structural information, π values, and the derived contrast function Φ are useful in identifying membrane imbedded residues and to differentiate between surface residues and those imbedded within the protein interior (8Isas J.M. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The accessibility parameter values for COX-2 reconstituted into liposomes and measured in the presence of N2 and NiEDDA (π(NiEDDA)), and in equilibrium with O2 (π (O2)) (Table 2) were plotted as a function of sequence position for helices A, B, and C (Fig. 2). The nine amino acids in Helix A show a periodic change in accessibility to both oxygen and NiEDDA with accessibility maxima at positions L60R1, T61R1, and K64R1, and accessibility minima at F59R1 and R62R1 (Fig. 2A). This periodicity is roughly 3.6, as would be predicted for an alpha helix. The phases of accessibility for oxygen and NiEDDA are synchronous for amino acids 59-65. The low π values for both oxygen and NiEDDA indicate amino acids 59-65 do not enter the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer and are not solvent accessible either. One probable explanation for this limited accessibility to both paramagnetic reagents is that these 7 amino acids associate with the glycerol backbone and phospholipid head groups, and their close interaction at the membrane interface excludes both polar and nonpolar paramagnetic agents. Those amino acids with the lowest π values for oxygen and NiEDDA, F59R1, and R62R1, would be predicted to be the most closely associated within the interfacial region. The greater accessibility to oxygen compared with NiEDDA (Φ> 0) of two amino acids in helix A, F66R1 and L67R1, indicate these residues likely are inserted in the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer (Fig. 2A) (8Isas J.M. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, this insertion must be relatively shallow as these amino acids are co-linear with preceding amino acids 59-65 situated at the membrane interface.TABLE 2Collision parameters for the COX-2 membrane binding domain mutants reconstituted into liposomes as determined by continuous wave power saturation EPR spectroscopyMutantsP½ (N2)P½ (Air)P½ (50 mm NiEDDA)ΔHp-pII (Air)II (NiEDDA)Helix AF59C4.616.9312.614.640.050.17L60C4.7211.3214.113.480.190.27T61C5.3810.4215.593.920.130.26R62C4.298.078.804.500.080.10I63C4.529.2011.614.060.120.18K64C4.619.4812.253.770.130.20L65C4.789.3412.553.920.120.20F66C4.098.827.153.480.140.09L67C4.429.607.283.050.170.09Helix BN72C3.737.456.674.290.090.07T73C4.247.4311.753.850.080.20V74C5.777.9513.514.620.050.17H75C4.588.0310.122.860.120.19Y76C4.588.1813.334.620.090.19I77C5.388.5412.624.070.070.18L78C6.028.8513.143.630.080.20Helix CG83C3.996.0010.764.620.040.15F84C3.665.889.294.950.040.11W85C4.376.8811.375.170.040.14N86C3.766.9011.714.180.080.19V87C3.438.5512.133.080.170.28V88C5.648.1710.024.40.060.10N89C3.116.265.584.510.050.06N90C4.857.5711.284.070.070.16 Open table in a new tab To confirm that the limited accessibility of helix A side chains to soluble paramagnetic reagents is caused by membrane association and not the orientation of these residues within COX-2, we examined their accessibility to another aqueous paramagnetic agent, CrOx, comparing COX-2 in detergent micelles and COX-2 reconstituted into liposomes (Fig. 3). 4The π values determined using the CrOx and NiEDDA paramagnetic reagents are not directly comparable because different concentrations were used; 10 mm for CrOx and 50 mm NiEDDA. Also, NiEDDA is neutral and CrOx has a net negative charge, so the π values for CrOx are higher for basic amino acids. CrOx was used instead of NiEDDA to replicate the EPR experiments of Lin et al. (23Lin Y. Nielsen R. Murray D. Hubbell W.L. Mailer C. Robinson B.H. Gelb M.H. Science. 1998; 279: 1925-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) to estimate distances of individual amino acids in sPLA2 from membranes and thus orientate this enzyme with respect to the bilayer. However, hydrophobic surface-exposed residues on the solubilized COX-2 exhibited relatively low accessibility to CrOx, presumably because of detergent masking, making distance estimates impossible for COX-2. (The sPLA enzyme studied by Lin et al. (23Lin Y. Nielsen R. Murray D. Hubbell W.L. Mailer C. Robinson B.H. Gelb M.H. Science. 1998; 279: 1925-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) is soluble, and EPR analysis is possible in the absence of detergents.) Gross differences in CrOx accessibility exist between the detergent-solubilized and liposome-reconstituted COX-2 enzymes, demonstrating that interaction the liposome restricts accessibility to water soluble paramagnetic reagents. Accessibility to CrOx is significantly reduced in the liposome incorporated COX-2 compared with the solubilized COX-2 for all amino acids except L6"
https://openalex.org/W1977703157,"Metastasis tumor-associated 1 short form (MTA1s) is a naturally occurring, alternatively spliced variant of MTA1 that functions as a repressor of estrogen receptor (ER) α transcriptional functions, at least in part by binding and sequestering ERα in the cytoplasm. A unique C-terminal 33-amino acid region containing a nuclear receptor (NR)-box motif (-LRILL-) mediates binding of MTA1s with ERα and is indispensable in this interaction. Here, we elucidated the solution structure of this 33-amino acid region by NMR spectroscopy. We found a predominance of the α-helical region toward the N-terminal region, which includes the NR-box motif. In silico docking and comparison studies showed similarities between the NR-box motif of MTA1s and a similar motif of coregulators, both in structure and mode of ERα binding. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, the MTA1s peptide effectively repressed ERα transactivation function, as evidenced by the estrogen response element-luc assay and down-regulation of estrogen-induced genes. In mechanistic studies, we found that the antiestrogenic effects of the MTA1s peptide were due to its ability to compete with the coactivator recruitment to ERα. Furthermore, the peptide efficiently repressed estrogen-induced proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7 cells. In addition, the MTA1s peptide blocked the progression of tumors formed by MCF-7 cells overexpressing an ERα coactivator in a xenograft-based assay. In brief, the characterization of structure and antiestrogenic activity of MTA1s peptide highlight its therapeutic potential.

Protein-protein interactions play an important role in communicating signals in the cell, which involves the conductance and amplification of the message from a master hormonal signal. In this context, the proteins involved in the downstream convergence of the signals are equipped with specialized domains that help establish specific inter-protein interactions to achieve high signal transduction efficiency. In recent years, extensive research on proteins such as the nuclear receptor (NR) 5The abbreviations used are: NR, nuclear receptor; MTA1s, metastasis tumor-associated 1 short form; PELP1, proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein 1; E2, estrogen (17-β-estradiol); ERα, estrogen receptor α; TFE, trifluoroethanol; ERE, estrogen response element; PR, progesterone receptor; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; dqf-COSY, double-quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy; GST, glutathione S-transferase; AIB1 amplified in breast cancer-1.5The abbreviations used are: NR, nuclear receptor; MTA1s, metastasis tumor-associated 1 short form; PELP1, proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein 1; E2, estrogen (17-β-estradiol); ERα, estrogen receptor α; TFE, trifluoroethanol; ERE, estrogen response element; PR, progesterone receptor; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; dqf-COSY, double-quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy; GST, glutathione S-transferase; AIB1 amplified in breast cancer-1. family of hormone-induced transcription factors has identified their mode of action and their binding partners, providing novel insights into the significance of specialized protein-protein interactions in hormone action.The NR family is composed of ∼48 structurally related transcription factors, which require their cognate ligand for activity. Upon ligand binding, the NR homodimers or heterodimers selectively bind to the specific short stretches of DNA, referred to as hormone response elements, and stimulate transcription of the target genes responsible for vital biological processes such as cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar).NRs are composed of structurally and functionally similar molecular domains, which reflect their common mode of action. The N-terminal domain is referred to as “activation function 1” (AF1), which shows a higher degree of sequence variation. NRs also have a highly conserved central DNA-binding domain composed of two zinc finger motifs. The ligand-binding domain to which the hormones bind is localized in the C-terminal half of the protein and is referred to as “activation function 2” (AF2). The extensive structural characterization of the ligand-binding domain of several receptors, such as estrogen receptor (ER) (2Tenenbaum D.M. Wang Y. Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5998-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), progesterone receptor (PR) (2Tenenbaum D.M. Wang Y. Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5998-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), and androgen receptor (3Shaffer P.L. Jivan A. Dollins D.E. Claesseus F. Gewirth D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4758-4763Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), has improved our understanding of the binding of the hormone, the resulting conformational changes in the receptor, and the basis of acute specificity of hormone binding to its receptor.The DNA binding of ligand-activated NR represents the delivery of the signal to the genome, whereas further amplification of the signal is brought about by the ability of NRs to recruit a family of proteins broadly referred to as “coactivators.” One of the functions of coactivator proteins is to directly or indirectly remodel the local chromatin structure through covalent modification of histones (acetylation, phosphorylation, or methylation), resulting in the opening of chromatin, greater accessibility of the target gene promoter to transcription machinery, and ultimately, gene transcription (4Singh R.R. Kumar R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 96: 490-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Numerous families of NR coactivators have been identified. The best studied include p300/CBP (CREB-binding protein), p300/CBP-associated factor, members of the SRC family (5Lonard D.M. O'Malley B.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and proline, glutamic acid, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1) (6Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.-A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).Coactivator proteins have multiple signature motifs referred to as NR-boxes, which are short stretches of leucine-rich sequences with consensus sequence of LXXLL (where X denotes any amino acid residue). The binding of the cognate ligand to the ligand-binding domain of the NR results in a conformational change involving the rearrangement of the positions of helices H3, H4, H5, and H12, leading to the formation of a hydrophobic pocket. The NR-boxes bind to this hydrophobic pocket in a helical conformation with a high degree of affinity, thus leading to the recruitment of coactivators to the activated NR. The interaction of a NR with a specific coactivator is determined by the specificity of the binding interactions between the NR-box motif and the ligand-binding domain of the NR. In general, each coactivator has more than one NR-box, and the differences in spacing of the NR-boxes, combined with the variable flanking sequences, have been implicated in conferring the specificity of this interaction (7McInerney E.M.

Biol. 1999; 19: 8226-8239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Estrogen receptor α (ERα) belongs to a subfamily of NRs, namely steroid hormone receptors. It functions as an estrogen-activated transcription factor and is involved in the up-regulation of downstream target genes, most of which are involved in the control of cell cycle progression and growth of human breast epithelium. Excessive stimulation of the ER pathway in the cell due to increased hormonal secretion or increased activation of the receptor can lead to augmentation of cell proliferation and thus a higher risk of growth deregulation, possibly resulting in breast cancer (4Singh R.R. Kumar R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 96: 490-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this context, the mode of action of ERα, its potential deregulation in cancer, and its coregulatory protein are subjects of intense study.In a previous report from this laboratory, we identified and characterized a unique coregulatory protein of ERα, namely MTA1s, which is a naturally occurring splice variant of MTA1 (9Kumar R. Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Talukder A.H. Mandal M. Yang Z. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Sahin A. Hortobagyi G. Adam L. Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Nature. 2002; 418: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). MTA1s localizes in the cytoplasm, and its C-terminal stretch of 33 amino acids bears no resemblance to any of the previously reported protein sequences. Situated in the early portion of this 33-amino acid region is an NR-box motif bearing the sequence -LRILL-(Fig. 1A). MTA1s uses this motif to interact and bind with the AF2 domain of ERα, leading to its cytoplasmic sequestration, decrease in the genomic functions of ERα, and augmentation of the aggressive ER-negative phenotypes in cells like increased metastasis, invasiveness, and resistance to antiestrogen therapy. In the present investigation, we elucidated the NMR solution structure of this stretch of 33 amino acids of MTA1s. Then, in an in silico modeling study, we simulated the binding of the NR-box motif to the AF2 domain of ERα. We determined the effects of MTA1s peptide on ERα transactivation function, estrogen-stimulated proliferation, and tumorigenesis of breast cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Reagents—Human breast cancer cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For estrogen treatment experiments, the regular medium was replaced with medium containing 5% dextran-charcoal-stripped medium. The C-terminal 33-amino acid peptide of MTA1s was purchased from SynPep Corp. (Dublin, CA) and fully characterized by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography, amino acid sequencing, and mass spectrometry.Far-UV Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Far UV CD spectra of the peptide dissolved in different concentrations of trifluoroethanol (TFE) (30, 40, 50, and 70%) were recorded from 260 to 210 nm using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter using 0.1-cm quartz cuvettes. Each spectrum was an average of five scans.NMR Spectroscopy—Perdeuterated TFE was supplied by Cambridge Isotope Inc. NMR samples were prepared by dissolving 4 mg of MTA1s peptide in 550 μl of a 1:1 mixture of perdeuterated TFE and H2O or perdeuterated TFE and 99.96% D2O. Proton NMR spectra were recorded either on a Varian UnityPlus spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA) operating at 750 MHz or a Bruker Avance (Billerica, MA) spectrometer operating at 500 MHz equipped with 1H/13C/15N triple resonance probes with pulse-field gradients. All experiments were performed at 25 °C, and the water peak was suppressed using either WET (10Ogg R.J. Kingsley P.B. Taylor J.S. J. Magn. Res. Ser.

Two-dimensional Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy NOESY, total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), and double-quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy (dqf-COSY) spectra were collected with the states-time proportional phase increment method. Double-quantum-filtered two-dimensional correlation (13Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar) spectra were collected with 4096 points in the t2 dimension, 400 real t1 increments, 32 transients per free induction decay, and a 2-s recycle delay. The data were zero-filled to 1024 points in the t1 dimension and multiplied by a 20°-shifted sine bell function in both dimensions prior to Fourier transformation. Estimates of NH-CαH coupling constants (3JNH) were obtained from the peak separation of multiplets in the dqf-COSY spectrum. TOCSY spectra (14Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Res. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3098) Google Scholar) were recorded at mixing times of 30, 60, and 75 ms with 4096 data points in the t2 dimension and 320 t1 increments. NOESY spectra (15Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar) were collected with 4096 data points in the t2 dimension and 320 real t1 increments using the states-time proportional phase increment method of phase cycling. Thirty-two transients per free induction decay were collected, with a relaxation delay time of 3.5 s. Mixing times of 60, 180, 250, and 400 ms were used. All NOESY spectra were zero-filled to 2048 in the t1 dimension prior to Fourier transformation and apodized with a 90°-shifted sine bell function. A NOESY spectrum with a 400-min mixing time was used only for resonance assignments. All spectra were processed on an SGI workstation using Felix version 2000 (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA) and internally referenced to the residual CDH resonance of perdeuterated TFE (3.9 ppm).Structure Calculations—Inter-proton distances were estimated from NOESY cross-peak intensities using Felix. NOESY intensities were classified as strong, medium, weak, or very weak and were assigned distance ranges of 1.8-2.5, 1.8-3.5, 1.8-4.5, or 1.8-5.5 Å, respectively, to be used as distance restraints in molecular dynamics simulation with XPLOR 3.1 (16Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). This produced a total of 310 inter-proton distance constraints. A linear peptide chain of the sequence was generated using XPLOR and was subjected to 10 ps of unrestrained molecular dynamics in the absence of any Van der Waal repulsion to generate a family of 30 initial randomized structures. Each of these structures was subjected to 500 steps of restrained energy minimization using the steepest descent algorithm and subsequently subjected to restrained molecular dynamics. The restrained molecular dynamics protocol consisted of 10 ps of restrained molecular dynamics at 1000 K, during which the Van der Waals' force constant was gradually increased. Each structure was subjected to an additional 5 ps of molecular dynamics at the maximum Van der Waals' force constant and was followed by a cooling step to 300 K over 7 ps. Finally, each structure was subjected to 1000 steps of energy minimization. A final 20 structures with the lowest energies and the least NOE violations were retained for structural analysis. The progress of structure refinement was visually monitored using the molecular modeling program Insight II (2000) (Accelrys, Inc.).Glutathione S-Transferase Pulldown Assay—In vitro transcription and translation of proteins was performed using a T7-TnT kit (Promega), where 1 μg of cDNA in pcDNA 3.1 vector was translated in the presence of [35S]methionine (for full-length ERα) and unlabeled, cold methionine (for the PELP1 N-terminal 1- to 400-amino acid region) in a reaction volume of 50 μl. The reaction mixture was diluted to 1 ml with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40). An equal aliquot was used for each GST pulldown assay. Translation and product size were verified by subjecting 5% of the reaction mixture to and autoradiography. The GST pulldown assays were performed by incubating equal amounts of the GST-tagged C-terminal 33-amino acid region of MTA1s, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) with the in vitro-translated 35S-labeled protein whose binding was being tested. Bound proteins were isolated by incubating the mixture for 3 h at 4 °C, after which the proteins were washed five times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, eluted with 2× SDS buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The bound proteins were then visualized by fluorography.Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy Studies—We determined the cellular localization of proteins by indirect immunofluorescence. In brief, cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized in methanol at -20 °C for 4 min. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at ambient temperature, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with 546-Alexa (red) or 488-Alexa (green) from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The DNA dye Topro-3 (Molecular Probes) was used to co-stain the DNA (blue). Confocal scanning analysis was performed with an Olympus FV300 laser scanning confocal microscope in accordance with established methods, using sequential laser excitation to minimize the possibility of fluorescent emission bleed-through. Each image is a three-dimensional reconstructed image of stacks of serial Z sections at the same cellular level and magnification. Co-localization of two proteins is shown as yellow for red and green fluorescence.Liposomal Encapsulation of the Peptide—A liposomal formulation of a 33-amino acid peptide was prepared as follows. Ten milliliters of t-butanol was added to 10 mg MTA1s peptide. Ddimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (Aventi Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was added to t-butanol (125 mg of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine:25 ml of t-butanol). After lipid was dissolved, Tween 20 (187 μl) was added to the lipid solution. The peptide and lipid solutions were then combined and mixed. After freezing the solution was lyophilized for 24 h. The resulting white powder was dissolved by addition of saline, and the contents were shaken by hand for 5 min. This process was repeated in a separate sample with addition of no peptide and was considered as control liposome.Transfection and Promoter Assays—Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For reporter assays, the required plasmids were transiently transfected using the FuGENE 6 kit from Roche Applied Science as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cotransfected with β-galactosidase, and a luciferase assay was performed using the Luc assay kit (Promega).Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Reverse transcription-PCR was performed using the Access RT-PCR kit (Promega) and specific primers for c-myc, total PR, and actin; the sequence details are as follows: PR, CAAATGAAAGCCAAGCCCTA and TGCCTCTCGCCTAGTTGATT; c-myc, CTCCTGGCAAAAGGTCAGAG and AGCTTTTGCTCCTCTGCTTG; and actin, GGACTTCGAGCAAGAGATGG and ACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGAC.Cell Proliferation, Soft Agar, and Tumorigenesis Assays—For cell proliferation assays, cells were grown in phenol red-free medium supplemented with 5% dextran-charcoal-stripped serum for 48 h and then treated with estrogen. The proliferation rate of the cells was measured by counting them in a Beckman Coulter Counter as previously described (17Balasenthil S. Vadlamudi R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22119-22127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Soft-agar colony-growth assays were performed as previously described (18Vadlamudi R.K. Adam L.

In brief, 1 ml of 0.6% Difco agar in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% dextran-charcoal-stripped serum and insulin was layered onto tissue culture plates. Test cells (1 × 104) mixed with 1 ml of 0.36% Bacto agar solution in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were layered on top of the 0.6% Bacto agar layer. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 21 days. For tumorigenesis studies, 5 × 107 cells were implanted into the mammary fat pads of six nude mice as previously described (19Vadlamudi R.K.

Female athymic mice, 4-6 weeks of age (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD) were housed in sterile environmental condition. All animal procedures were performed in compliance with the Institute Animal Care and Use Committee and National Institutes of Health Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.RESULTSFar-UV CD Analysis of MTA1s Peptide—The 33-amino acid peptide had a high degree of hydrophobicity because of an abundance of hydrophobic amino acids (five leucines, three tryptophans, three isoleucines, one valine, and one methionine) and consequently had low solubility in the complete aqueous system. The presence of TFE at 30% or more in solution facilitated the dissolution of the peptide. To gain preliminary insight into the solution structure of the peptide, we initially performed a far-UV CD spectral analysis with different percentages of TFE in sterile Millipore water (Fig. 1B). The spectra showed the two characteristic peaks at 208 nm and 225-230 nm at all concentrations of TFE and showed the predominance of the α-helical structure. A noticeable increase in ellipticity between 225 and 230 nm was observed among the samples in 30%, 40%, and 50% TFE there were no further structural changes when the TFE concentration was increased beyond 50%.NMR Spectral Assignment—Solubility of the peptide in water was not sufficient to create a sample with the concentrations required for NMR studies. As the solubility could be increased with the addition of TFE, the NMR experiments were performed in a mix solvent of TFE and H2O. Because there was evidence of multiple conformations at lower TFE:H2O ratios, we collected a series of TOCSY spectra at TFE:H2O ratios of 30:70%, 50:50%, and 70:30% to determine the optimum solvent conditions for NMR studies. The multiple peaks present at lower TFE:H2O ratios disappeared at the 50:50% solvent ratio, and the spectra underwent no further substantial changes when the TFE:H2O ratio was increased to 70:30%. This observation was consistent with the CD data collected at increasing TFE: H2O ratios, and all NMR spectra were collected with samples made in TFE/H2O mixture (1:1) at ambient temperature and pH 4.7.Proton resonance assignment was accomplished using the standard sequential resonance assignment method outlined by Wuthrich (20Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, New York1986: 130-161Google Scholar); with it, we identified the proton spin systems of all amino acids using dqf-COSY and TOCSY spectra followed by the establishment of sequential NH-CαH, NH-CβH, and NH-NH correlations using NOESY spectra. The dqf-COSY spectrum produced 27 well resolved correlations of 31 possible NH-CαH cross-peaks in its fingerprint region (Fig. 1C). Three of the missing four correlations could be observed in the corresponding region of the TOCSY spectrum. By combining the spin-system information obtained from the scalar experiments with the through-space correlations in NOESY spectra, tryptophans 15 and 16 were used as the starting point in tracing the sequential connectivity patterns.NMR data strongly suggested the existence of the N-terminal helical region and the two turn structures toward the C terminus, but we found no evidence of a long-range interaction between the helical and C-terminal regions to suggest any stable tertiary fold in the molecule. In fact, the less orderly regions between the structured regions of the molecule rendered the C-terminal more flexible. CαH resonances of the residues in the C terminus also displayed significant chemical shift deviations from their standard random coil values, which suggested a regular helical geometry similar to the N terminus. However, there were not enough medium range NOE interactions that are typical of continuous helical structures.Structure Refinement—The three-dimensional structure calculation was performed with 310 inter-proton distances (174 inter-residue and 136 intra-residue) using the simulated annealing protocol within XPLOR 3.1. The overlay of the 12 structures is shown in Fig. 2A, and the stereo view of the energy-minimized mean structure of the 12 final structures is shown in Fig. 2B. Residues Met-1 through Ser-3 were largely unstructured in all final structures. As the mean structure shows, there was a stable helical region from Leu-4 through Leu-17 with a loosely defined helical segment from Leu-7 through Asp-9. The helical segment spanning the first three residues displays the characteristics of the 3-10 helix, whereas the remainder of the helix (Ile-10 through Leu-17) represents a regular α-helix. Because of the stable structure in the N-terminal region of the molecule, more than 60% of the extracted structural restraints came from the Ser-3 through Glu-18 segment. The smaller number of restraints per residue in the region immediately following the α-helix provides increased flexibility to the C-terminal region (Table 1).FIGURE 2Detailed solution structure of the MTA1s peptide derived by NMR spectroscopy and in silico docking studies of the peptide with AF2 domain of ERα.

Whitehouse C.A. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 292-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 2Dreyfus L.A. Burns D. Bacterial Protein Toxins. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2003: 257-270Google Scholar). The cytopathic effects associated with CDT intoxication are a direct result of chromosomal DNA damage inflicted by the CdtB subunit, a homolog of eukaryotic type I DNase (3Lara-Tejero M. Galan J.E. Science. 2000; 290: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 4Elwell C.A. Dreyfus L.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). CdtB-mediated chromosome strand breakage signals the induction of an ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated)- or ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related)-dependent mitotic checkpoint resulting in the sequestration of Cdc25, a block in the cell cycle at the G2/M boundary, cellular distension, and ultimately cell death by endoreduplication or apoptosis (2Dreyfus L.A. Burns D. Bacterial Protein Toxins. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2003: 257-270Google Scholar, 5de Rycke J. Oswald E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 141-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CDT holotoxin is a heterotrimer composed of CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC subunits. Although the catalyst for CDT-mediated apoptosis is ultimately attributed to the DNase activity of CdtB, all three subunits are required for cellular entry of CDT (6Lara-Tejero M. Galan J.E. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4358-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 7Elwell C. Chao K.L. Patel K. Dreyfus L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3418-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The CdtA and CdtC subunits are lectin-like domains that bind carbohydrate residues on the target cell surface, whereby CDT is subsequently internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis (8Cortes-Bratti X. Chaves-Olarte E. Lagergard T. Thelestam M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6903-6911Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Guerra L. Teter K. Lilley B.N. Stenerlow B. Holmes R.K. Ploegh H.L. Sandvig K. Thelestam M. Frisan T. Cell. Microbiol. 2005; 7: 921-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The Haemophilus ducreyi holotoxin structure (HdCDT) has demonstrated that CDT is an AB type toxin, with the catalytically active A subunit of the AB toxin corresponding to the CdtB subunit (10Nesic D. Hsu Y. Stebbins C.E. Nature. 2004; 429: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Inspection of this structure and of the structurally similar CDT holotoxin from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (AaCDT) (11Yamada T. Komoto J. Saiki K. Konishi K. Takusagawa F. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 362-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) revealed that one face of the CdtA-CdtC dimer binds the CdtB subunit. Mutagenesis studies of HdCDT suggest that another face of the dimer with a grooved ricin B-chain fold mediates cell surface binding (10Nesic D. Hsu Y. Stebbins C.E. Nature. 2004; 429: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Trafficking of CDT to the nucleus is thought to involve retrograde transport through the Golgi and the ultimate translocation of CdtB from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nuclear envelope by an apparent ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation)-independent step (9Guerra L. Teter K. Lilley B.N. Stenerlow B. Holmes R.K. Ploegh H.L. Sandvig K. Thelestam M. Frisan T. Cell. Microbiol. 2005; 7: 921-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). CdtB traverses the nuclear envelope by virtue of at least one nuclear localization sequence (NLS), which is recognized by unknown cognate nuclear localization factors (12McSweeney L.A. Dreyfus L.A. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although CdtB disassembly from the CDT holotoxin has not been established, direct deposition of the isolated EcCdtB subunit into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells by electroporation promotes cell cycle arrest at G2/M, demonstrating that free EcCdtB locates to the nucleus and retains toxicity (7Elwell C. Chao K.L. Patel K. Dreyfus L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3418-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Significantly, toxicity determined by this avenue is dependent on the integrity of two EcCdtB arginine residues (Arg191-Arg192) within the characterized NLS (12McSweeney L.A. Dreyfus L.A. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here, we report the first high-resolution structure of a free CdtB subunit. The nearly identical active site conformations in the free and holotoxin states of CdtB suggest that the much lower enzymatic activity of this subunit within assembled CDT is mediated by interactions with CdtC rather than intramolecular structural rearrangement within CdtB upon holotoxin disassembly (10Nesic D. Hsu Y. Stebbins C.E. Nature. 2004; 429: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In addition, NMR 15N relaxation studies identify two regions of dynamic disorder within the ensemble of solution conformers of free EcCdtB, suggesting that distinct structural transitions involving ordered and disordered states underlie CdtB functional activation (holotoxin disassembly) and binding to cognate nuclear localization factors. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—The cdtB gene used for these studies was derived from Escherichia coli strain 9142–88 (O128:H–) (13Pickett C.L. Cottle D.L. Pesci E.C. Bikah G. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1046-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned as described previously (14Aragon V. Chao K. Dreyfus L.A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3774-3780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three distinct CDT operons have been characterized from various E. coli strains and are designated CDT-I, CDT-II, and CDT-III (2Dreyfus L.A. Burns D. Bacterial Protein Toxins. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2003: 257-270Google Scholar). E. coli 9142-88 produces CDT-II, and thus the CdtB used in this work is designated EcCdtB-II, referred to herein as EcCdtB. Recombinant EcCdtB protein corresponding to the mature subunit (residues 1–251) plus an 11-residue N-terminal linker including six histidine residues was crystallized by microbatch techniques as described elsewhere (15Hontz J.H. Villar-Lecumberri M.T. Dreyfus L.A. Yoder M.D. Acta Crystallogr. 2006; F62: 192-195Google Scholar). The EcCdtB toxin preparation possessed identical toxicity and enzymatic activity as reported previously (7Elwell C. Chao K.L. Patel K. Dreyfus L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3418-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). X-ray data collected at Advanced Photon Source 22BM on a Mar300 charge-coupled device detector to 1.73 Å were processed by HKL2000 (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar), and phases were determined by molecular replacement as implemented in AMoRe (17Navazza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) using the H. ducreyi CdtB subunit from the holotoxin structure (hHdCdtB) as the search model (Protein Data Bank code 1SR4) (10Nesic D. Hsu Y. Stebbins C.E. Nature. 2004; 429: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The hHdCdtB phasing model included residues 28–81, 93–134, 144–163, 194–211, 225–233, 237–241, and 267–281. The remaining residues were added by iterative cycles of manual model building in O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and model refinement by simulated annealing and conjugate gradient minimization as implemented in CNS (Crystallography and NMR System) (19Brunger A.T.

Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12421) Google Scholar). Root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) between CdtB structures were calculated using SwissPdbViewer, version 3.7 (24Guex N. Peitsch M.C.

Multiple R1 and R2 spectra were used to estimate the precision of the peak intensities. Five pairs of 15N-{1H}NOE spectra were collected with and without 1H saturation to allow for estimation of experimental uncertainty. A 7-s recovery delay was used for all 15N relaxation experiments.

Open table in a new tab The EcCdtB structure belongs to the α + β structural class and consists of a β-sandwich with α-helices on the exterior (Fig. 2A). Although EcCdtB has low sequence identity with the DNase-I family of enzymes including bovine DNase I (19.4% identity), human HapI DNA repair endonuclease (17.3% identity), and E. coli EXO III (18.6% identity), the protein adopts a very similar fold. Differences between the DNase I and CdtB family folds include the number of strands in the β-sheets and the number of connecting helices. As shown in Fig. 2B, the CdtB fold is composed of 8- and 6-stranded β-sheets (10Nesic D. Hsu Y. Stebbins C.E. Nature. 2004; 429: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 11Yamada T. Komoto J. Saiki K. Konishi K. Takusagawa F. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 362-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas the canonical DNase I fold has two 6-stranded sheets (37Suck D. Lahm A. Oefner C. Nature. 1988; 332: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In the CdtB fold, two additional antiparallel β-strands (3 and 4) occur at the C-terminal end of β-sheet 1. The α-helix connecting β-strands 2 and 3 in the DNase I family fold is missing in the corresponding region connecting β-strands 2 and 3 in the CdtB family fold. Active Site of EcCdtB—The active site of EcCdtB contains two histidine residues (His136 and His243) that are essential for catalysis of DNA phosphodiester cleavage (Fig. 3) (3Lara-Tejero M. Galan J.E. Science. 2000; 290: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 4Elwell C.A. Dreyfus L.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Moreover, based on structural similarities to DNase I, catalytic enhancement attributed to a raising of the His243 pKa in EcCdtB is likely to be contributed by Asp211 through side chain carboxylate-imidazole hydrogen bonding (37Suck D. Lahm A. Oefner C. Nature. 1988; 332: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 38Weston S.A. Lahm A. Suck D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1237-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 39Jones S.J. Worrall A.F. Connolly B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The solvent structure surrounding these three conserved amino acids in EcCdtB and hHdCdtB shows striking structural conservation. The lower resolution of the A. actinomycetemcomitans CdtB subunit from the holotoxin structure (hAaCdtB) makes the comparison of solvent structure more difficult and is not included in Fig. 3. Three additional residues that make direct DNA substrate contacts in DNase I are located in structurally conserved positions in EcCdtB (Arg95, Arg120, and Asn176). All of these important catalytic and substrate binding residues, which are absolutely conserved in all known CDTs, have remarkably similar side chain positions in the assembled holotoxin (10Nesic D. Hsu Y. Stebbins C.E. Nature. 2004; 429: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 11Yamada T. Komoto J. Saiki K. Konishi K. Takusagawa F. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 362-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and free EcCdtB structures (Fig. 3). Comparison of Free EcCdtB with CdtB in Holotoxins—The 1.02-Å r.m.s.d. measured for 216 Cα atoms from aligned, non-gapped residues of free EcCdtB and the homologous hHdCdtB subunit (48% identity) crystal structures demonstrates that conformational rearrangements accompanying holotoxin assembly are not global (Fig. 4). If only residues within regular secondary structure elements are considered (111 residues), the r.m.s.d. between Cα atoms from the two CdtB proteins drops to 0.70 Å. Given the 97% CdtB sequence identity between H. ducreyi and A. actinomycetemcomitans CdtB subunits, it is not surprising that over the entire structure, the Cα r.m.s.d. from these holotoxin-associated proteins is somewhat lower (0.43 Å, see Fig. 4). Indeed, the backbone topology of all three subunits from these two CDT holotoxins is nearly identical (10Nesic D. Hsu Y. Stebbins C.E. Nature. 2004; 429: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 11Yamada T. Komoto J. Saiki K. Konishi K. Takusagawa F. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 362-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although the structures of CdtB in the free and assembled forms are very similar, the CdtB crystal structures show significant protein backbone variation between free (EcCdtB) and holotoxin (hHdCdtB and hAaCdtB) subunits in the loop region joining the two C-terminal β-sheet 2 strands β13 and β14 (residues Ile230–Pro245 of EcCdtB, Fig. 4). Close inspection of the free EcCdtB structural alignments with hHdCdtB and hAaCdtB revealed that most of this region of CdtB is in the subunit interface with CdtA and CdtC (supplemental Fig. 1). This interface is occupied largely by residues Leu263–His274 in hHdCdtB and hAaCdtB (corresponding to EcCdtB residues Tyr232–His243) and contains a three-residue α-helix (residues Leu263–Gln265) in both proteins that is not formed by the corresponding residues of the free EcCdtB subunit (Tyr232–Ala234). Although the r.m.s.d. between Cα atoms of hHdCdtB and hAaCdtb in this region are only 0.30 Å, the corresponding Cα r.m.s.d. between EcCdtB and hHdCdtB is 5.64 Å in the same region. NLS Regions—A tandem arginine sequence located in helix E of EcCdtB (Arg191-Arg192, Fig. 5), which is part of a larger monopartite or bipartite NLS (40Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar), is essential for nuclear translocation and CDT-mediated intoxication (12McSweeney L.A. Dreyfus L.A. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although a corresponding tandem arginine sequence within an NLS for HdC-dtB and AaCdtB has not been characterized experimentally, the expanded structural alignment in the vicinity of the EcCdtB NLS region with the holotoxin subunits shown in Fig. 5 reveals that the hHdCdtB and hAaCdtB Arg249-Arg250 side chain positions face out into solution in close proximity to the EcCdtB Arg191-Arg192 side chains, even though the locations of these arginine pairs in the backbone topology of the respective CdtB orthologs are quite different. Solution NMR Structural and 15N Relaxation Studies of Free EcCdtB—To identify potential ensemble variations in structure and backbone motions that could be related to CdtB-dependent CDT biological function, NMR solution studies of EcCdtB were carried out with an identical EcCdtB protein to that used for crystallographic studies (15Hontz J.H. Villar-Lecumberri M.T. Dreyfus L.A. Yoder M.D. Acta Crystallogr. 2006; F62: 192-195Google Scholar, 25Villar-Lecumberri M.T. Potter B.M. Wang Z. Dreyfus L. Laity J.H. J. Biomol. NMR 2006. 2006; 34Google Scholar). Although the quality of the NMR spectra were generally good for the uniformly 2H-, 15N-, and 13C-labeled EcCdtB protein, 29 residues concentrated primarily within the first 100 N-terminal residues of free EcCdtB were characterized by μs-ms time scale exchange broadening to the extent that the corresponding 1H-15N-HSQC resonances were unobservable (25Villar-Lecumberri M.T. Potter B.M. Wang Z. Dreyfus L. Laity J.H. J. Biomol. NMR 2006. 2006; 34Google Scholar). The comparison of backbone EcCdtB residue 1HN, 15N, 13Cα, and 13CO NMR chemical shift differences with those of the corresponding residues in small “random coil” peptides shown in Fig. 6A is a good indicator of protein secondary structure (26Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar, 27Braun D. Wider G. Wuthrich K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 8466-8469Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For the majority of the EcCdtB protein, the secondary structure predictions match those observed in the crystallographic model of the protein (Fig. 2). However, the 13Cα and 13CO chemical shift differences from random coil in the regions of EcCdtB encompassing helix A (E20-I31), β-strand 2 (Ile39–Gln43), and β-strand 5 (Gln81–Ser87) are not completely consistent with the observed secondary structural elements in the crystal structure, although these regions have large gaps in chemical shift information because of conformational exchange (Fig. 6A) (25Villar-Lecumberri M.T. Potter B.M. Wang Z. Dreyfus L. Laity J.H. J. Biomol. NMR 2006. 2006; 34Google Scholar). More significantly, the region of EcCdtB encompassing residues Leu186–Thr209 (Fig. 6A, blue bars) has backbone 1HN, 15N, 13Cα, and 13CO NMR chemical shifts remarkably similar to those of random coil. This disorder (blue region in Fig. 6C) is somewhat unexpected given the elements of regular secondary structure (helix E and β-strand 11) observed in the same region of the EcCdtB crystal structure (Fig. 2A). Similar trends were observed for residues Glu233–Asp242 of EcCdtB (red regions in Fig. 6, A and C), although, in general, the chemical differences from random coil in this region are larger than those in the other disordered region (residues Leu186–Thr209). Complementary 15N relaxation NMR spectra were recorded and analyzed for the free EcCdtB protein in solution (Fig. 6B). The majority of EcCdtB residues are characterized by fast internal ns-ps (15N-{1H}NOE) and slower “tumbling” ns (R2/R1) solution dynamic properties consistent with a 29-kDa protein. This 15N relaxation data fit well to an isotropic hydrodynamic model for EcCdtB, which produced a rotational correlation time of 13.6 ns using those regions of defined solution secondary structure predicted from the NMR chemical shift data shown in Fig. 6A. However, the disordered regions of EcCdtB evident from chemical shift comparisons (Leu186–Thr209 and Gly233–Asp242) were likewise characterized by fast internal and tumbling dynamic properties characteristic of disordered polypeptides (41Palmer III, A.G. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 3623-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Residues Ser74–Gln80 of EcCdtB, which connect β-strands 3 and 4 (green regions in Fig. 6, A–C) also had 15N relaxation properties consistent with a flexible loop. Model-free analysis (34Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 104: 4546-4549Crossref Scopus (3409) Google Scholar, 35Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 104: 4559-4570Crossref Scopus (1877) Google Scholar) of fast internal motions within well structured regions of CdtB reveal consistent small amplitude (mostly <100 ps) motions, in contrast to larger amplitude motions in the three regions described above characterized by higher ns-ps mobility (data not shown). We note that sufficient electron density for model determination was evident in all three regions with solution disorder (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Backbone ϕ and ψ dihedral angles from the solution structure were calculated for those residues of EcCdtB in ordered regions for which a reliable angle could be obtained using the TALOS method (42Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). A comparison of 100 such TALOS-derived ϕ and ψ dihedral angles with those extracted from the crystal structure shown in supplemental Fig. 2 suggests an EcCdtB ensemble average solution conformation very similar to that in the crystal state for the ordered regions of the protein. Analysis of Crystal Contacts and Correlation to Regions of Solution Disorder—Given the NMR results indicating solution disorder in the three regions of EcCdtB, crystal contacts were analyzed as a possible explanation for the structural order in the same regions of the corresponding crystallographic model. The EcCdtB crystals used for x-ray diffraction analysis have a relatively low solvent content of 34% (Table 1). Of the 253 residues in the final model, 110 (43%) make crystal contacts. Regions showing symmetry contacts are spread throughout the protein (Fig. 6D). The disordered regions at Ser74–Gln80 and Gly233–Asp242 in the solution state of the protein contain significant crystal contacts. In the Gly233–Asp242 region, all residues make crystal contacts with symmetry related molecules, with five of the 10 residues forming hydrogen bonds with symmetry-related molecules. In contrast, in the longest disordered region (Leu186–Thr209, blue in Fig. 6, A–C), crystal contacts are localized around the five-residue helix E. Although it has been established that CdtB is the catalytically active subunit of the CDT toxin and that CdtA and CdtC are necessary for cell surface binding and cellular entry (1Pickett C.L.
