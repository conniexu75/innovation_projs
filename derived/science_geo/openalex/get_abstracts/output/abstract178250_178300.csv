Activating mutations in one RAF gene, BRAF, have been found in a high proportion of melanomas and in a small fraction of other cancers1. Here we show that BRAF mutations in colorectal cancers occur only in tumours that do not carry mutations in a RAS gene known as KRAS, and that BRAF mutation is linked to the proficiency of these tumours in repairing mismatched bases in DNA. Our results not only provide genetic support for the idea that mutations in BRAF and KRAS exert equivalent effects in tumorigenesis2, but also emphasize the role of repair processes in establishing the mutation spectra that underpin human cancer."

Recently we reported evidence for the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) in phosphorylating Nrf2 and triggering its nuclear translocation in response to oxidative stress. We show here that phosphorylation of purified rat Nrf2 by the catalytic subunit of PKC was blocked by a synthetic peptide mimicking one of the potential PKC sites. Accordingly, Nrf2 bearing a Ser to Ala mutation at amino acid 40 (S40A) could not be phosphorylated by PKC. The S40A mutation did not affect in vitro binding of Nrf2/MafK to the ARE. However, it partially impaired Nrf2 activation of ARE-driven transcription in a reporter gene assay when Keap1 was overexpressed. In vitro transcribed/translated Keap1 could be coimmunoprecipitated with Nrf2. Phosphorylation of wild-type Nrf2 by PKC promoted its dissociation from Keap1, whereas the Nrf2-S40A mutant remained associated. These findings together with our prior studies suggest that the PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Nrf2 at Ser-40 is a critical signaling event leading to ARE-mediated cellular antioxidant response.

An important regulatory step leading to ARE activation is the oxidative stress-induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2, which normally appears to be sequestered in the cytoplasm by the cytoskeleton-binding Keap1 protein (12Itoh K.

However, the precise mechanism by which ARE-activating signals reach Nrf2 and cause dissociation of the putative inhibitory Nrf2-Keap1 complex remains unclear. Several protein kinase pathways have been implicated in transducing oxidative stress signals to gene expression mediated through the ARE. A number of reports have addressed a possible role for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) in ARE activation. The findings have however remained controversial: ERK1/2 has been found to regulate the ARE positively in certain hepatoma cells (15Yu R. Lei W. Mandlekar S. Weber M.J. Der C.J., Wu, J. Kong A.-N.T.

Similarly, p38 MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase has also been shown to affect ARE activity, either positively (17Zipper L.M. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

More recently, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and its downstream target Akt/PKB (protein kinase B) have been linked to activation of the ARE in hepatoma (18Kang K.W. Cho M.K. Lee C.H. Kim S.G. Mol.

However, none of the known cellular components involved in ARE regulation have been shown to be targets of any of these kinases. Recently, we reported several findings that indicate an important role for protein kinase C (PKC) in the ARE-mediated gene expression (23Huang H.-C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). 1) Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a potent PKC-activating phorbol ester, stimulates ARE-driven transcription, which is blocked by selective PKC inhibitors. 2) Nuclear translocation of Nrf2 is induced by PMA but arrested by PKC inhibitors. 3) Both Nrf2 nuclear translocation and activation of the ARE bytert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) treatment are suppressed by PKC inhibitors. 4) Nrf2 is phosphorylated in vitro by purified PKC or immunoprecipitated PKC from tBHQ-induced cells. 5) Nrf2 phosphorylation in HepG2 cells is enhanced by PMA and tBHQ but abolished by PKC inhibitors. Together these results suggest that one critical step in the signaling cascade toward ARE activation may be the phosphorylation of Nrf2 by PKC, which promotes the nuclear translocation of this transcription factor in response to oxidative stress. The present study is a continuation of our investigation into the involvement of PKC in regulating the ARE. We sought to identify the site of phosphorylation in Nrf2 by PKC and to characterize the mechanistic significance of Nrf2 phosphorylation. A high level expression plasmid of rat Nrf2 gene linked at its N terminus to a His6tag was obtained by cloning the rat Nrf2 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF037350) into the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen). S40A mutant (AGT → GCT) was obtained by the PCR mutagenesis method and cloned into the same expression plasmid. Nrf2 wild-type or S40A mutant expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h at 30 °C in Escherichia coli M15 cells. Cell pellets were suspended and sonicated in a buffer containing 100 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, 0.5% Tween 20, and 15% glycerol. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min, soluble lysates were loaded onto a Ni-NTA column. A 40 mm imidazole wash was followed by elution at 250 mm imidazole in the same buffer. Eluted fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. Purified His6-tagged rat Nrf2 wild-type and S40A mutant proteins were used as substrates in in vitro kinase assays with catalytic subunits of rat brain PKC (Calbiochem). 50-μl reactions were carried out at 30 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP and stopped at the indicated times by the addition of sample buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis. The level of [33P]ATP incorporation into Nrf2 was determined by autoradiography or by a PhosphorImager (Fujifilm FLA-2000). [γ-33P]ATP was omitted from kinase reactions whose products were subsequently used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) or in immunoprecipitation studies as described below. EMSAs were performed essentially as described previously (24Nguyen T. Huang H.-C. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15466-15473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the ratQR gene ARE was used as probe after end-labeling with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The sequence of the DNA probe was 5′-GATTTCAGTCTAGAGTCACAGTGACTTGGCAAAATCTGAGCCG-3′ (ARE core sequence highlighted in bold). Purified rat Nrf2 wild-type or S40A mutant protein was preincubated with rat MafK (unless otherwise indicated) for 20 min at 25 °C before the addition of DNA probe for another 20 min at 30 °C. MafK proteins were produced in vitro by the TnT coupled transcription/translation wheat germ extract system (Promega) (24Nguyen T. Huang H.-C. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15466-15473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). DNA-protein interactions were detected by electrophoresis on non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels in Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer, followed by autoradiography. For competition experiments, a 200-fold molar excess of either unlabeled probe or a random 43-base oligonucleotide was included in the preincubation mixture at 25 °C before the addition of the labeled probe. For supershift assay, an anti-Nrf2 antibody (sc-722X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added after the binding reaction for 4 h at 4 °C before electrophoresis. To determine the effect of PKC phosphorylation of Nrf2 on ARE binding, Nrf2 wild-type or S40A mutant protein was first incubated in kinase assay buffer for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence or absence of PKC, before an aliquot was taken for incubation with MafK and the labeled probe for EMSA. HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained as previously described (1Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14648-14653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection was performed as before on cells in 6-well plates at ∼70% confluency using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). 1 μg of an expression plasmid containing rat QR ARE linked to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene was co-transfected with 0.12 μg of pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) bearing wild-type or S40A mutant Nrf2 and, where indicated, with 60 ng of pcDNA3 plasmid containing rat Keap1 (GenBankTM accession number AF304364). Total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant at 2 μg by the addition of pcDNA3 vector to the DNA mixture. Cells were incubated for 18 h after overnight recovery from transfection and harvested in M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce). Cell lysates were assayed for CAT activity as described (23Huang H.-C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and the results were quantitated by a PhosphorImager. In vitrotranscription/translation of the pcDNA3 plasmids bearing Nrf2 and Keap1 was carried out using the TnT coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. The products were then incubated together for 15 min at 30 °C before immunoprecipitation by an anti-Nrf2 antibody in an immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of protein A-Trisacryl beads (Pierce). The mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h and washed extensively in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl. Precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Quantitation of band intensity was performed on a PhosphorImager. To determine the effect of PKC phosphorylation on Nrf2-Keap1 interaction, an equal amount of labeled Nrf2 wild-type or S40A mutant was incubated with PKC and Keap1 in kinase assay buffer for 30 min at 30 °C before immunoprecipitation. In prior studies we showed that Nrf2 is phosphorylated in HepG2 cells (23Huang H.-C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Nrf2 phosphorylation was activated by the phorbol ester PMA but was blocked by the PKC inhibitor staurosporine, suggesting that Nrf2 may be a PKC target. Accordingly, in vitro PKC assays revealed that purified rat Nrf2 was phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of rat brain PKC or by PKC immunoprecipitated from HepG2 lysates. To identify the specific site(s) of phosphorylation in Nrf2 by PKC, a serine/threonine kinase, synthetic peptides mimicking potential Nrf2 PKC sites were used as competitors for in vitro phosphorylation of Nrf2 by PKC. Rat Nrf2 is a 597-amino acid residue protein containing seven potential PKC phosphorylation sites according to the canonical pattern (S/T)X(R/K), where X is any residue. Six 8-residue peptides (36–43, 375–382, 414–421, 435–442, 585–592, 590–597) were synthesized corresponding to potential PKC target sites at Ser-40, Ser-378, Thr-417, Thr-418, Ser-439, Ser-589, and Thr-594, respectively (Fig. 1 A). All were readily soluble in 20% Me2SO except peptide 36–43, whose solubility was greatly improved when it was extended at both ends by one residue to a 10-mer (EVFDFSQRQK). In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (23Huang H.-C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) using commercially obtained catalytic subunits of rat brain PKC and purified rat Nrf2 as substrate. Although Nrf2 phosphorylation by PKC appeared unaffected or even enhanced by several of the peptides, it was reduced by more than 90% in the presence of 5 mm peptide 35–44 (Fig. 1 B). PKC activity against a standard substrate was not suppressed by this peptide (not shown), indicating that its effect was not on the enzyme itself. These findings suggest that Ser-40 of Nrf2 is an authentic site of phosphorylation by PKC. To confirm these peptidomimetic data a site-directed mutagenesis approach was utilized. Rat Nrf2 gene bearing a AGT → GCT (Ser to Ala) mutation at amino acid position 40 (nrf2-S40A) was cloned into a high level expression plasmid containing a His6-tag N-terminal to the insert. E. coli-expressed Nrf2-S40A protein was purified to near homogeneity by metal chelate affinity chromatography (Fig.2). The prominent band at ∼90 kDa was confirmed to be Nrf2 by Western blot using an antibody against Nrf2 (not shown). Nrf2-S40A was then used in parallel with wild-type Nrf2 as substrates in in vitro PKC assays. As shown in Fig. 3, the single amino acid change from Ser to Ala at position 40 completely abolished PKC phosphorylation of Nrf2. The lack of residual phosphorylation in this mutant indicates that Ser-40 is the only PKC site, consistent with the peptide competition data.Figure 3PKC phosphorylates Nrf2 at Ser-40. PKC activity was assayed as in Fig. 1 B using 2 μm purified wild-type Nrf2 or Nrf2-S40A mutant protein as substrate for the indicated times at 30 °C. Western blot using an anti-Nrf2 antibody was performed for an aliquot of the same samples as those shown in the autoradiogram above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It should be noted that Ser-40 is also one of four potential PKC sites in human Nrf2 (GenBankTM accession number Q16236), which is highly homologous to the rat Nrf2. It is likely that PKC phosphorylates human Nrf2 at the same site and that the phosphorylation of Nrf2 observed in human hepatoma HepG2 cells (23Huang H.-C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) is at least in part catalyzed by PKC on Ser-40. We and others have previously shown thatin vitro transcribed/translated Nrf2 binds with high affinity to the ARE as part of a heterodimeric complex with small Maf proteins (9Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar, 24Nguyen T. Huang H.-C. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To examine whether interaction of Nrf2 with the ARE is affected by the mutation abolishing PKC phosphorylation, in vitro EMSAs with E. coli-expressed His6-Nrf2-S40A and in vitro translated MafK were performed, using ARE sequence derived from the rat QR gene as probe. As expected, Nrf2 (wild-type or S40A) or MafK alone could not bind to the ARE. In the presence of MafK, however, both Nrf2-WT and Nrf2-S40A formed shifted complexes with the ARE probe. These complexes were supershifted upon incubation with an antibody against Nrf2 (Fig.4 A). The intensity and mobility of the wild-type and S40A mutant complexes are virtually indistinguishable. Furthermore, formation of both types of complexes was completely blocked by excess unlabeled QR ARE but not by random oligonucleotides (Fig. 4 B). Therefore the S40A mutation did not alter the specific high affinity interaction between Nrf2/MafK and the ARE. Indeed, PKC-phosphorylated Nrf2 bound to the ARE in a similar manner as non-phosphorylated wild-type Nrf2 or the S40A mutant defective for PKC phosphorylation (Fig.4 C). Thus the formation of ARE-binding transcriptional complex containing Nrf2 and small Maf proteins does not appear to be regulated by the phosphorylation of Nrf2 by PKC. To determine whether the Nrf2-S40A mutant has an effect on Nrf2 transactivation of the ARE, we conducted transient transfection experiments in HepG2 cells. Introduction of Nrf2-overexpressing plasmid into a number of hepatoma cell lines has previously been shown to result in dose-dependent activation of the ARE-mediated transcription (16Yu R. Chen C., Mo, Y.Y. Hebbar V. Owuor E.D. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39907-39913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 24Nguyen T. Huang H.-C. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15466-15473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). A ratQR ARE-linked CAT reporter gene was co-transfected with a high copy plasmid vector bearing wild-type Nrf2. An ∼12-fold activation of ARE-driven CAT activity was observed using 0.12 μg of Nrf2 plasmid DNA. Co-transfection with an equal amount of Nrf2-S40A resulted in comparable levels of activation (Fig.5). Because Keap1 has been shown to repress Nrf2 activity by sequestering it in the cytoplasm (12Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar), we asked if any functional defect of the Nrf2-S40A mutant might involve Keap1. As expected, co-transfection of Keap1 with wild-type Nrf2 decreased Nrf2-dependent ARE activation. Interestingly, overexpression of Keap1 resulted in a partial impairment of ARE activation by the Nrf2-S40A mutant that was not seen with endogenous levels of Keap1 in HepG2 cells. ARE activation by Nrf2-S40A was reduced to a level less than 50% of that achieved with wild-type Nrf2, from an ∼6-fold activation to 2.5-fold (Fig. 5). In these transfected cells, Nrf2 wild-type and S40A proteins were expressed to comparable levels as verified by Western blot using an anti-Nrf2 antibody (not shown). These findings indicate a role for Keap1 in the apparent transactivation defect exhibited by the Nrf2-S40A mutant. Studies from Itoh et al. (12Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar) have shown that Nrf2 interacts with Keap1 through a region of about 100 amino acid residues at its N terminus (named Neh2 domain). Because PKC phosphorylates Nrf2 at Ser-40, we explored whether the Keap1-dependent deficiency of the S40A mutant in ARE activation is attributable to its altered interaction with Keap1. We first tested if in vitro transcribed/translated Nrf2 and Keap1 proteins could associate with each other. Nrf2 and Keap1 were labeled in the presence of [35S]methionine during separate translation reactions. The products were then incubated together, followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Nrf2 antibody, and the precipitated products were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Keap1 could be quantitatively co-precipitated with Nrf2 by the anti-Nrf2 antibody (Fig.6 A). We then investigated the interaction between Keap1 and the Nrf2-S40A mutant. Similar amounts of Keap1 co-precipitated with both wild-type and S40A Nrf2 (Fig. 6 B). However, when immunoprecipitation was carried out after incubation of these components in the presence of PKC, the amount of Keap1 associated with wild-type Nrf2 was reduced by about 50%. By contrast, the S40A mutant interacted with Keap1 to a similar extent with or without PKC (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, the dissociation of Keap1 from wild-type Nrf2 was abolished when PKC was preincubated in the presence of 10 nm staurosporine, a potent inhibitor of PKC (not shown). We therefore conclude that phosphorylation of Nrf2 by PKC at Ser-40 plays a critical role in facilitating the release of Nrf2 from Keap1. Consequently, the impaired ability of the Nrf2-S40A mutant to activate ARE-mediated transcription is most likely due to a defect in the dissociation of Nrf2 from its cytoplasmic inhibitor Keap1. We recently reported that phosphorylation of Nrf2 by PKC induces nuclear translocation of this transcription factor and activation of the ARE in response to oxidative stress (23Huang H.-C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further characterized the molecular mechanisms of Nrf2 phosphorylation and its functional significance in ARE activation. Our data demonstrate that PKC phosphorylates Nrf2 at Ser-40 and facilitates its release from the cytoplasmic anchor Keap1. Together with our earlier findings, these results suggest a mechanistic model of ARE-mediated cellular antioxidant response involving the PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Nrf2 at Ser-40 as a specific trigger for the nuclear translocation of this transcription factor. Previous studies from Itoh et al. (12Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar) using cell-based overexpression systems demonstrated that Nrf2 is normally retained in the cytoplasm by its association with the cytoskeleton-binding protein Keap1. Electrophilic agents liberate Nrf2 from the Nrf2-Keap1 cytosolic complex, allowing it to traverse into the nucleus to activate ARE-driven gene expression. Deletion mapping experiments further indicated that Keap1 binds through the Neh2 domain of Nrf2, comprising ∼100 N-terminal amino acids (12Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). Our in vitro results here provide a mechanistic explanation for the importance of this domain in Nrf2-Keap1 interaction. A critical residue within this region appears to be Ser-40, whose phosphorylation by PKC upon oxidative stress promotes the dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1. It remains to be tested in intact cells whether Ser-40 phosphorylation is sufficient or whether other molecular events and components must also be involved for Nrf2 to disengage from its cytoplasmic inhibitor and translocate into the nucleus. It is also not known whether Keap1 itself is a PKC target. Rat Keap1 possesses five potential PKC sites, four within the KELCH and C-terminal regions, which have been identified as important for binding to Nrf2 (13Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, because we did not observe a reduction in the amount of Keap1 co-precipitated with the Nrf2-S40A mutant upon incubation with PKC, apparently no PKC-induced alterations occurred on Keap1 that would weaken the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction in vitro. The present findings suggest that the functional significance of PKC phosphorylation of Nrf2 is likely to involve specifically the nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling step. The defect exhibited by the Nrf2-S40A mutant in ARE-driven reporter gene assay appears to correlate with the amount of the available cytoplasmic inhibitor Keap1. Thus the repression of ARE-mediated gene expression by overexpression of Keap1 became more pronounced in the presence of Nrf2-S40A, presumably due to the dissociation defect of this mutant. However, the formation of ARE-binding complex with Nrf2/MafK in the gel shift assay was not affected by the state of PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Nrf2 or when the S40A mutant was used. Therefore PKC phosphorylation does not appear to play a role in either the association of Nrf2/MafK heterodimer with the ARE sequence or dimerization of Nrf2 with MafK. PKC has also been implicated in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated transcriptional regulation (26Chen Y.-H. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26261-26266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar,27Long W.P. Chen X. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12391-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although PKC action in that pathway appears to involve a nuclear event, it does not impact the DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor (26Chen Y.-H. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26261-26266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether the Nrf2 proteins present in the nucleus are predominantly of the phosphorylated form, even though phosphorylation by PKC does not seem to be required for high affinity binding of Nrf2 to the ARE. The simplest model based upon our results would suggest that phospho-Nrf2, after release from Keap1, is directly transported into the nucleus for binding to the ARE sequence. However, it is possible that yet unidentified protein phosphatases act before the binding of Nrf2 to its target sequence and promote the export of this transcription factor back into the cytoplasm as part of a regulatory cycle of phosphorylation-dependent nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling of Nrf2. In studies of other systems, oxidants have been shown to activate kinases and inactivate phosphatases in concert (28Meng T.C. Fukada T. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Our prior studies suggesting the involvement of PKC in ARE activation by Nrf2 were performed with pharmacological inhibitors of PKC such as staurosporine. In identifying a site-specific mutant (S40A) that abrogates PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Nrf2 and impairs its dissociation from Keap1, we have confirmed an essential role for PKC phosphorylation of Nrf2 in the signaling pathway leading to ARE activation. The present results support a direct role for PKC, rather than its downstream kinases, in the regulation of Nrf2 activity. An important question is whether PKC itself may be a sensor for oxidative stress. An early report showed that catechol and hydroquinone, which are potent inducers of the ARE, also activate PKC (29Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.-H. Gundimeda U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12233-12237Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). PKC possesses structural features that suggest it as an excellent target for direct redox-sensitive modifications (30Gopalakrishna R. Jaken S. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Indeed there have been several reports indicating oxidation of reactive cysteines in both its N-terminal regulatory and C-terminal catalytic domains that serves to regulate PKC activity (30Gopalakrishna R. Jaken S. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Although it is at present unclear what isoform(s) of PKC phosphorylates Nrf2, a likely candidate may be PKCδ, which has been implicated in a number of cellular processes involving oxidative stress (31Jain N.

Reports from several laboratories have indicated the involvement of other kinase pathways in ARE-mediated transcription (17Zipper L.M. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Transfection studies using wild-type and dominant-negative MAPK and Nrf2 have suggested a positive role for MAPK in ARE regulation in HepG2 cells (15Yu R. Lei W. Mandlekar S. Weber M.J.

However, inhibition of ERK in H4IIE cells resulted in increased expression of the GSTA2 gene, suggesting a negative role for ERK in ARE-mediated activity (18Kang K.W. Cho M.K. Lee C.H. Kim S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The exact role of the p38 kinase in ARE regulation is also confusing from existing literature, as several laboratories have reported a positive effect (17Zipper L.M. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 19Kang K.W. Ryu J.H. Kim S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1017-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Alam J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27694-27702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) whereas another showed that a p38 inhibitor caused the activation of ARE-dependent reporter gene (21Yu R. Mandlekar S. Lei W. Fahl W.E. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2322-2327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Recently, PI 3-kinase and its downstream Akt kinase have been shown by inhibitor studies to be positive regulators of ARE activity in H4IIE hepatoma (18Kang K.W. Cho M.K. Lee C.H. Kim S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells (22Lee J.-M. Hanson J.M. Chu W.A. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20011-20016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Further elucidation of the precise roles of these kinases will be facilitated by the identification of specific cellular targets known to be involved in ARE regulation. It should be noted that in IMR-32 cells, ARE-mediated transcription has been reported to be PKC-independent (33Lee J.-M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, the same experimental system was also shown to be oxidative stress-independent, in contrast to the many studies from hepatocytes where oxidative stress-induced ARE-mediated gene expression has been firmly established. Although the EMSA results indicate that Nrf2/MafK interaction with ARE is independent of PKC phosphorylation, it remains possible that binding of Nrf2 with a nuclear factor other than small Maf proteins to the ARE may be subjected to regulation by PKC. Our earlier studies have suggested that such alternative factors may exist, as nuclear extract from HepG2 and H4IIEC3 cells formed complexes with the ARE that are distinct from those formed by in vitrotranslated Nrf2/MafK proteins (24Nguyen T. Huang H.-C. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15466-15473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). There have been several reports of alternative Nrf2 partners binding to the ARE (34Montano M.M. Wittmann B.M. Bianco N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34306-34313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35Zhu M. Fahl W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). CBP (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein) has recently been shown to bind Nrf2 via two transactivation domains on Nrf2 in a cooperative manner to activate ARE transcription synergistically (36Katoh Y. Itoh K. Yoshida E. Miyagishi M. Fukamizu A. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). ATF4 has also been demonstrated to interact with Nrf2 in regulating ARE-driven heme oxygenase-1 gene expression (37He C.H. Gong P., Hu, B. Stewart D. Choi M.E. Choi A.M. Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It should be noted that although the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 has been shown to be a major mechanism for ARE activation in all cell types examined, Nrf2 also has a documented role in constitutive ARE-mediated gene expression. We have shown that Nrf2 is present in the nucleus without tBHQ stimulation, and its essential role in mediating the basal activity of the ARE has been reported in a cell-free system (24Nguyen T. Huang H.-C. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15466-15473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and in nrf2-null mice (11McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Chanas S.A. Henderson C.J. McLellan L.I. Wolf C.R. Cavin C. Hayes J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3299-3307PubMed Google Scholar). Future investigations should reveal molecular details that comprise the coordinated transcriptional activation of antioxidant enzymes, of which phosphorylation of Nrf2 at Ser-40 by PKC is but one of many critical regulatory steps.

https://openalex.org/W2036284918,"Mitochondrial aconitase is sensitive to oxidative inactivation and can aggregate and accumulate in many age-related disorders. Here we report that Lon protease, an ATP-stimulated mitochondrial matrix protein, selectively recognizes and degrades the oxidized, hydrophobic form of aconitase after mild oxidative modification, but that severe oxidation results in aconitase aggregation, which makes it a poor substrate for Lon. Similarly, a morpholino oligodeoxynucleotide directed against the lon gene markedly decreases the amount of Lon protein, Lon activity and aconitase degradation in WI-38 VA-13 human lung fibroblasts and causes accumulation of oxidatively modified aconitase. The ATP-stimulated Lon protease may be an essential defence against the stress of life in an oxygen environment. By recognizing minor oxidative changes to protein structure and rapidly degrading the mildly modified protein, Lon protease may prevent extensive oxidation, aggregation and accumulation of aconitase, which could otherwise compromise mitochondrial function and cellular viability. Aconitase is probably only one of many mitochondrial matrix proteins that are preferentially degraded by Lon protease after oxidative modification."
https://openalex.org/W2141150496,"Iron-responsive elements (IREs) are the RNA stem loops that control cellular iron homeostasis by regulating ferritin translation and transferrin receptor mRNA stability. We mapped a novel iron-responsive element (IRE-Type II) within the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP) transcript (+51 to +94 from the 5′-cap site). The APP mRNA IRE is located immediately upstream of an interleukin-1 responsive acute box domain (+101 to +146). APP 5′-UTR conferred translation was selectively down-regulated in response to intracellular iron chelation using three separate reporter assays (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, luciferase, and red fluorescent protein reflecting an inhibition of APP holoprotein translation in response to iron chelation. Iron influx reversed this inhibition. As an internal control to ensure specificity, a viral internal ribosome entry sequence was unresponsive to intracellular iron chelation with desferrioxamine. Using RNA mobility shift assays, the APP 5′-UTRs, encompassing the IRE, bind specifically to recombinant iron-regulatory proteins (IRP) and to IRP from neuroblastoma cell lysates. IRP binding to the APP 5′-UTR is reduced after treatment of cells with desferrioxamine and increased after interleukin-1 stimulation. IRP binding is abrogated when APP cRNA probe is mutated in the core IRE domain (Δ4 bases:Δ83AGAG86). Iron regulation of APP mRNA through the APP 5′-UTR points to a role for iron in the metabolism of APP and confirms that this RNA structure can be a target for the selection of small molecule drugs, such as desferrioxamine (Fe chelator) and clioquinol (Fe, Cu, and Zn chelator), which reduce Aβ peptide burden during Alzheimer's disease.

Also the iron storage protein ferritin is present in neuritic amyloid plaques (28Robinson S. Noone D.F. Kril J. Haliday G.M. Alzheimer's Res. 1995; 1: 191-193Google Scholar). Intracellular iron levels modulate the cleavage of APP and cause a higher secretion of APP ectodomain (APP(s)) into the conditioned medium of Chinese hamster ovary cells (29Bodovitz S. Falduto M.T. Frail D.E. Klein W.L. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 307-315Google Scholar). Iron may modulate the levels of cellular APP associated with protein processing by α-secretase, a metalloprotease that is a member of the ADAM family of metalloproteases (30Buxbaum J.D. Choi E.K. Luo Y. Lilliehook C. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.E. Wasco W. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1177-1181Google Scholar, 31Buxbaum J. Oishi M. Chen H.I. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Jaffe E.A. Gandy S.E. Geengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10075-10078Google Scholar).In this report we extend our previous observations that characterized how IL-1 controls APP translation to show the presence of a novel and functional iron-regulatory element within the 5′-UTR of APP mRNA (+51 to +94 from the 5′-cap site). This IRE, which we name IRE-Type II, is located immediately upstream of the IL-1 responsive acute box domain in the 5′-UTR of APP mRNA (+101 to +146), similar to the ferritin L- and H-mRNAs. The APP 5′-UTR was selectively responsive to intracellular iron levels in a pattern that reflects iron-dependent regulation of intracellular APP synthesis. To assess specificity to iron levels, two separate viral RNA sequences were shown to be unresponsive to intracellular iron chelation with desferrioxamine. Finally APP mRNAs specifically bound iron-regulatory proteins (IRP-1 and/or IRP-2) in the 5′-UTR whereas IRP binding no longer occurred when cRNA probes were mutated in the core IRE homology domain in the APP 5′-UTR translational control element.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAPP Protein SynthesisNeuroblastoma cells (SHSY-5Y) were exposed to 50 and 250 μm desferrioxamine and iron supplement as 100 and 500 μm ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) for 24 and 48 h. Metabolic labeling of neuroblastoma cells was performed for 30 min using 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine in methionine-free medium (Invitrogen), and pulse-labeled APP was immunoprecipitated from lysates as described previously (9Rogers J.T. Leiter L.M. McPhee J. Cahill C.M. Zhan S.S. Potter H. Nilsson L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6421-6431Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed using a Bio-Rad apparatus to electrophorese the proteins (20-μg uniform loading), which were run at 100 V and transferred at 200 V according to manufacturer's instructions. Prior to loading, protein content was determined by protein BCA assays (Pierce) and standardized to allow equal loading of each lane. APP(s)-specific R1753 antibody was a gift from Dr. Dennis Selkoe. Used at a 1:1,500 dilution, R1753 recognizes amino acids 596–611 in APP. Immunoprecipitations were performed using the C8 antibody, which recognizes APP amino acids 676–695. Blots were quantitated using NIH Image.APP mRNA LevelsNorthern blots were performed on iron-treated and desferrioxamine-treated neuroblastoma cells (SHSY-5Y and SKNSH) as described (9Rogers J.T. Leiter L.M. McPhee J. Cahill C.M. Zhan S.S. Potter H. Nilsson L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6421-6431Google Scholar). A 3-kb SmaI fragment of APP cDNA was random prime-labeled and hybridized to Northern blots loaded with 10 μg of total RNA per well. Random prime-labeled ferritin cDNA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNAs were used to standardize the northern blots for differences in sample loading.Construct PreparationThe pSV2(APP)CAT construct encoded the 90-ntSmaI-NruI fragment of the APP gene 5′-UTR inserted immediately in front of the CAT gene start codon. Briefly, the 3-kb SmaI fragment was cloned into the uniqueStuI site of the pSV2 CAT expression vector to generate pSV2(APP1)CAT. DNA from pSV2(APP1)CAT was then truncated of coding sequences by NruI and HindIII double digestion and ligation after dephosphorylation. The resulting construct encoded a CAT gene transcribed from the early T-antigen promoter with 90 nt (SmaI-NruI APP 5′-UTR fragment) inserted into the 5′-UTR of the CAT reporter gene at a unique StuI site.The luciferase expression construct designated as pGAL encodes the complete 146-nucleotide 5′-UTR of the APP gene inserted as a PCR-generated DNA cassette in between the HindIII andNcoI sites in front of the luciferase gene in the pGL-3 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfectants of pGAL transcribe a hybrid luciferase reporter that encodes the IL-1 responsive 90-nucleotide element described previously (9Rogers J.T. Leiter L.M. McPhee J. Cahill C.M. Zhan S.S. Potter H. Nilsson L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6421-6431Google Scholar) and additional upstream 55 nucleotides immediately downstream from the 5′-cap site of APP mRNA.The complete 1.2-kb APP 3′-UTR was cloned into a convenientXbaI site immediately downstream of the luciferase gene in the pGAL construct to generate pGALA. Hybrid APP-luciferase mRNAs expressed from pGALA transfectants transcribe the 146-nt APP 5′-UTR sequence element inserted upstream of the reporter gene start codon but also transcribes an additional 1.2 kb of APP 3′-UTR sequence downstream from the luciferase stop codon (11Mbella E.G. Bertrand S. Huez G. Octave J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4572-4579Google Scholar). Therefore the hybrid APP-luciferase mRNA expressed in pGALA transfectants exhibits the natural arrangement of APP gene 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions to provide an authentic representation of the non-coding regions of the precursor transcript.The dicistronic construct, pJR-1, was prepared from the pIRES2 vector backbone (Clontech), which contained an internal ribosome entry site element (IRES) followed by enhanced green fluorescent protein gene. A PCR-generated DNA cassette encoding 146 bp of APP 5′-UTR was first cloned into the multiple cloning site of pIRES2 between unique XhoI/EcoRI sites. The downstreamEcoRI/BamHI sites were then used to ligate in the luciferase reporter gene (Luc; Promega, Madison, WI) or the RFP reporter gene (dsREDN-1; Clontech).For RNA gel shift studies the pBS(APP) construct used for REMSA studies was prepared by inserting the 3-kb fragment of APP into the co-blunt-ended HincII site in pBS(sk+) vector (Stratagene) (see Fig. 6). Sense APP 5′-UTR cRNAs were transcribed using T3 polymerase with linearized NruI-digested pBS(APP) as template. For experimental controls, T7 polymerase transcribed antisense transcripts from SpeI-digested pBSAPP template. A labeled 28-nt sense H-ferritin IRE transcript was transcribed from the pTHfer construct, which was a generous gift of Dr. Kuhn (Epingles, Switzerland) (32Mullner E. Neupert B. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Google Scholar).TransfectionsNeuroblastoma cells (SY5Y) were transfected with 10 μg of DNA from the pGL-3, pGAL, and pGALA constructs and were co-transfected with 5 μg of DNA from a construct that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP). Luciferase and GFP reporter genes were expressed from an SV40 promoter. Transfections were performed in the presence of LipofectAMINE-2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Typically neuroblastoma cells were grown in flasks (100 mm2) for each treatment. Each flask was transfected (12 h) and subsequently passaged equally into 96-well plates for exposure to chelators for 48 h (n = 5) for each treatment.Desferrioxamine (50 mm stock in phosphate-buffered saline), clioquinol (50 mm stock in Me2SO), and EDTA were each diluted 1/5000 to 1/50,000 into 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without fetal calf serum) for 1 h at 37 °C to maximize solubility. Each individual concentration of chelators (100-μl volumes) was tested in triplicate or quadruplicate. After the treatment with each chelator for 36 h cell viability was established by a microscopic examination of each well. Cell viability was confirmed by relative expression of GFP in each 96-well by reading at 480/509-nm wavelength (GFP) using an automated Wallac 1420 multilabel counter. After obtaining a GFP readout the cells in each 96-well plate were lysed in 50 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) followed by luciferase assays using the Walac1420 counter.Stable SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma transfectants were prepared using a construct, pJR-1, which transcribes a single dicistronic reporter mRNA. In this configuration, the RFP gene is under the translational control of APP 5′-UTR sequences (90-nt IL-1-responsive and baseline translational enhancer element) and a downstream GFP gene that is controlled translationally by an intergenic 5′-UTR IRES. Stably transfected neuroblastoma cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of desferrioxamine (1–100 μm) for 48 h, and RFP and GFP expression was then monitored by reading fluorescence as GFP = 480/509-nm and RFP = 558/583-nm wavelength. Intracellular iron chelation suppressed RFP gene expression in neuroblastoma cells. GFP served as an internal control to register the lack of responsiveness of the downstream IRES to increasing levels of iron chelation.REMSAIn Vitro Transcription and Synthesis of RNA Probes of APP and H-ferritin 5′-Untranslated RegionsFerritin IRE transcripts were prepared from a pBluescript construct, pTHfer (32Mullner E. Neupert B. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Google Scholar), in which the human H-ferritin IRE region was encoded on the template DNA. The 56-base sense transcript encoding the canonical IRE (an experimental positive control) was prepared with T7 RNA polymerase fromBamHI-digested pTHfer DNA. The pDAPP was used as template for the synthesis of APP transcripts encoding putative IRE-Type II sequences. Template DNA was digested with NruI and transcribed with T3 to prepare [32P]UTP-labeled sense APP transcripts containing 90 nt of APP 5′-UTR with an extra 25-nt pBS vector sequence at the 5′-end. SpeI-digested pBSAPP was used as a template for the preparation of antisense APP cRNAs for use as an experimental specificity control in REMSAs (see Fig. 8).Figure 8Transcripts encoding the H-ferritin IRE cross-competed with 32P-labeled APP 5′-UTR cRNA probes for binding with neuroblastoma and hepatoma lysate proteins. Panel A, SH-SY5Y lysates. H-ferritin IRE (200× excess) prevented (100%) labeled APP cRNAs from binding to lysate IRP (comparelanes 1 and 3). A similar 200× excess of unlabeled APP cRNA 75% competed with labeled APP cRNA for formation of a specific RPC with SY5Y lysates (compare lanes 1 and5). As a control for specificity APP 3′-UTR sequences (200× molar excess) did not compete with labeled APP 5′-UTRcRNA probe for formation of a specific RNA-binding complex (RPC) in SH-SY5Y lysates (compare lanes 1 and 7). Lanes 2,4, 6, and 8, the32P-labeled APP 5′-UTR probe was reacted with 50 μg of lysate (saturated binding observed, equivalent to input probe).Panel B, HepG2 lysates. H-ferritin IRE (200× excess) prevented 100% labeled APP cRNAs from binding to lysate IRP (comparelanes 1 and 3). A similar 200× excess of unlabeled APP cRNA 100% competed with labeled APP cRNA for formation of a specific RPC in SY5Y lysates (compare lanes 1 and5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)cRNAs encoding APP and H-ferritin 5′-UTR sequences were transcribed into labeled APP 5′-UTR transcripts (115 nt) (see Fig. 6 C) and an H-ferritin IRE (pTFer) (32Mullner E. Neupert B. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Google Scholar). DNA was transcribed in a 10-μl reaction volume with 1 unit of T7 or T3 RNA polymerase (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 60 min in the presence of 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences), 2.5 mm each of rATP, rCTP, and rGTP (Amersham Biosciences), and 20 μm dithiothreitol. After preparation of labeled RNA probes the DNA template was digested with DNaseI prior to phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The labeled cRNA transcripts were size-separated by electrophoresis through 6% urea sequencing gels, and the full-length transcripts were eluted into 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μm dithiothreitol, 10 μg tRNA, and 5 units of RNasin prior to phenol/chloroform extraction and by ethanol precipitation. Labeled RNA probes had a specific activity of 1–4 × 1010 cpm/μg RNA (30–50% incorporation), were resuspended in 80 μl of H2O (treated with diethyl pyrocarbonate), and stored in aliquots at −80 °C.For RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (REMSA), cytoplasmic extracts or recombinant IRP-1 were incubated with radiolabeled transcript (2–10 × 104 cpm, 2.5–10 pg) for 30 min at 22 °C in a reaction volume of 10 μl made up with cytoplasmic extraction buffer (33Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Walker C.E. Staton J.M. Leedman P.J. Biotechniques. 1999; 27: 1032-1039Google Scholar). In some reactions mouse polyclonal serum to IRP-1 or mouse pre-immune serum were included to generate supershifting complexes. Subsequently, RNase T1 (0–1 units) was added to the mixture for 10 min at 22 °C, followed by heparin (0–10 μg/μl) (Sigma) for 10 min at 22 °C. RNA loading dye (0.1 volume of 9% glycerol, 10 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol; 5× TBE) was added to each sample. The RNA·protein complexes (RPC) were resolved at 4 °C for 15–20 min at 200 V in 0.5× TBE on a 1.5-mm 4–5% polyacrylamide mini-gel (Bio-Rad) (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 36:1 or 70:1) after pre-electrophoresis (200 V for 20 min; 0.5× TBE running buffer). After electrophoresis, gels were fixed in 10% isopropanol/7% acetic acid and vacuum-dried, and RNA-protein interactions were detected by use of a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).Competition between ferritin IRE and APP 5′-UTR transcripts were performed using 200-fold excess unlabeled transcript. In Fig. 8 the 115-nt 32P-labeled APP 5′-UTR cRNA probe was transcribed from NruI-digested pBSAPP DNA template (as above). We used a 200-fold excess of unlabeled cRNA probe and included tRNA to combat problems of input cRNA degradation. Competitor, at 200-fold excess, was used to test for specificity. Heparin and tRNA were included in reactions to ensure more specific detection of RNA-protein interactions.DISCUSSIONThis report shows the presence of a functional iron-regulatory element (IRE-Type II) in the 5′-UTR of the mRNA encoding the Alzheimer's APP. We showed previously that IL-1 stimulated 12-fold increase in the rate of astrocytic APP protein synthesis through APP 5′-UTR sequences (9Rogers J.T. Leiter L.M. McPhee J. Cahill C.M. Zhan S.S. Potter H. Nilsson L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6421-6431Google Scholar). In that same report, iron levels were also shown to regulate APP mRNA translation in astrocytic cells (9Rogers J.T. Leiter L.M. McPhee J. Cahill C.M. Zhan S.S. Potter H. Nilsson L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6421-6431Google Scholar), consistent with the current results in which intracellular iron levels significantly modulated APP synthesis in neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 1). APP(s) secretion reflected intracellular APP levels in response to desferrioxamine treatment (Fig. 1, panels A andB). However iron may decrease α-secretase cleavage rates, because 24- and 48-h stimulation with ferric ammonium citrate (500 μm) reduced APP(s) levels at the same time that intracellular APP levels were enhanced significantly.Sequences within the APP 5′-UTR conferred iron-dependent regulation to three separate reporter genes (CAT, luciferase, and RFP reporters; see Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). RNA gel-shift data confirmed that APP 5′-UTR sequences bound specifically to recombinant IRP-1. The interaction between lysate IRP and APP 5′-UTR sequences was reproduced using neuroblastoma lysates such that a 200-fold excess presence of H-ferritin IRE cross-competed the interaction as effectively as unlabeled homologous APP 5′-UTR transcript. The interaction was also supershifted using anti-IRP-1 antiserum. The finding that pre-immune serum no longer generated the supershifted complex (Fig. 6 D) provide an important selectively control to validate the antibodies raised against rIRP-1.We concluded that the RPC formed after the binding of IRP-1 to APP 5′-UTR sequences was highly specific, because the RPC was supershifted readily and cross-competed by unlabeled ferritin IRE sequences. Binding to recombinant IRP-1 and a lysate IRP was abrogated by the presence of a deletion mutation in the loop region homology domain-2. In Fig. 7there remains residual binding between the mutant APP 5′-UTR cRNA and recombinant IRP-1 (10-fold less than wild-type). We suggest the maintenance of residual binding was probably the result of interaction between the upstream IRE homology domain in the 146-nt APP 5′-UTR (+51 to +66) and rIRP-1. When using neuroblastoma lysate, other RNA-binding protein interactions to the APP 5′-UTR override the capacity to observe residual binding as seen in lane 3 of Fig. 7. These data lend further support to the model that APP 5′-UTR sequences interact specifically with an iron-regulatory protein in human neuroblastoma and hepatoma cells.The active element was designated as an IRE-Type II, because labeled cRNAs encoding the APP 5′-UTR showed a different modulated binding to IRPs relative to labeled H-ferritin IRE transcripts (Fig. 6). Desferrioxamine decreased the specific interaction between APP 5′-UTR cRNA probes and neuroblastoma lysate IRP whereas the interaction between hepatic IRP-1 and IRP-2 and the ferritin IRE is known to be increased significantly in response to intracellular iron chelation (39Toth I. Yuan L. Rogers J.T. Boyce H. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4467-4473Google Scholar). The RNA gel-shift data showed that the APP IRE-Type II exhibited modulated binding to IRP-1/IRP-2 similar to IRE-like sequences in the 5′-UTR of the mRNA encoding transferrin (Tf RNA) (41Cox L.A. Adrian G.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4738-4745Google Scholar). However Tf mRNA 5′-UTR sequences were shown to bind at higher affinity to lysates derived from cells exposed to iron chelation with desferrioxamine (41Cox L.A. Adrian G.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4738-4745Google Scholar).The finding that 5′-UTR sequences in both APP and ferritin mRNAs are baseline translation enhancers (Fig. 4) differs from the mechanisms governing translation of most eukaryotic mRNAs. For example, the transcript for FMR protein (fragile X mentalretardation protein) encodes 5′-UTR secondary structure that is sufficiently stable to suppress downstream FMR protein translation (42Feng Y. Zhang F. Lokey L.K. Chastain J.L. Lakkis L. Eberhart D. Warren S.T. Science. 1995; 268: 731-734Google Scholar). APP 5′-UTR RNA sequences are predicted to fold into an RNA stem loop with a Gibbs free energy value (ΔG = −54.9 kcal/mol (9Rogers J.T. Leiter L.M. McPhee J. Cahill C.M. Zhan S.S. Potter H.

https://openalex.org/W148236777,"There is a marked variation in whether people retain sufficient cognitive function to maintain their quality of life and independence in old age, even among those without dementia, so it would be valuable to identify the determinants of normal age-related cognitive change. We have retested non-demented 80-year-olds who were participants in the Scottish Mental Survey of 1932, and find that the variation in their non-pathological cognitive change from age 11 to 80 is related to their apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. This effect of the APOE epsilon 4 allele on normal cognitive ageing may be mediated by a mechanism that is at least partly independent of its predisposing effect towards Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W2039580832,"MOR1 is a member of the MAP215 family of microtubule-associated proteins and is required to establish interphase arrays of cortical microtubules in plant cells1. Here we show that MOR1 binds microtubules in vivo, localizing to both cortical microtubules and to areas of overlapping microtubules in the phragmoplast. Genetic complementation of the cytokinesis-defective gemini pollen 1-1 (gem1-1) mutation with MOR1 shows that MOR1 (which is synonymous with the protein GEM1) is essential in cytokinesis. Phenotypic analysis of gem1-1 and gem1-2, which contains a T-DNA insertion, confirm that MOR1/GEM1 is essential for regular patterns of cytokinesis. Both the gem1-1 and gem1-2 mutations cause the truncation of the MOR1/GEM1 protein. In addition, the carboxy-terminal domain of the protein, which is absent in both mutants, binds microtubules in vitro. Our data show that MOR1/GEM1 has an essential role in the cytokinetic phragmoplast."

ASIC1a and ASIC1b are alternative splice products of the ASIC1 gene. Here we show that both splice variants show steady-state inactivation when exposed to slightly decreased pH, limiting their operational range. Compared with ASIC1a, steady-state inactivation and pH activation of ASIC1b are shifted to more acidic values by 0.25 and 0.7 pH units, respectively, extending the dynamic range of ASIC1. Shifts of inactivation and activation are intimately linked; only two amino acids in the ectodomain, which are exchanged by alternative splicing, control both properties. Moreover, we show that extracellular, divalent cations like Ca2+ and Mg2+ as well as the polyvalent cation spermine shift the steady-state inactivation of ASIC1a and ASIC1b to more acidic values. This leads to a potentiation of the channel response and is due to a stabilization of the resting state. Our results indicate that ASIC1b is an effective sensor of transient H+ signals during slight acidosis and that, in addition to alternative splicing, interaction with di- and polyvalent cations extends the dynamic range of ASIC H+ sensors.

Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Members of this super gene family form Na+-selective ion channels (P Na/P K, 8–100) that can be blocked by amiloride (IC50, 0.2–20 μm). All family members show some common hallmarks including two hydrophobic domains, short intracellular N and C termini, and a large extracellular loop containing conserved cysteines. Channels of this gene family probably form tetramers (2Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 3Coscoy S.

Both subunits are Na+-selective (P Na/P K ≈ 10–15), and only ASIC1a has a low Ca2+ permeability (P Na/P Ca ≈ 15) (4Bässler E.L. Ngo-Anh T.J. Geisler H.S. Ruppersberg J.P. Gründer S. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 2326-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) has led to the proposal that ASIC1a mediates excitation during tissue acidosis, which accompanies inflammation and ischemia. However, complete desensitization of ASIC1 makes it difficult to imagine how this channel can sense H+ signals during inflammation and ischemia when the pH persistently falls. Here we show that both ASIC1a and ASIC1b undergo steady-state inactivation. The steady-state inactivation curve for ASIC1b is shifted by 0.25 pH units to more acidic values as compared with ASIC1a, showing that ASIC1b can operate at a more acidic resting pH. pH activation is shifted by 0.7 pH units. Differences in the sensitivity of activation and inactivation by protons are intimately linked, as both are controlled by only two amino acids in the ectodomain. These two amino acids are exchanged by alternative splicing. Moreover, we show that Ca2+, Mg2+, and spermine, when applied during the steady-state, shift the steady-state inactivation curves of both ASIC1a and ASIC1b. This leads to a potentiation of the current. Modulation by di- and polyvalent cations may be a means to adapt ASIC1 activity to changes in the extracellular concentration of these ions. Our results show that ASIC1b can replace ASIC1a as a sensor of transient proton signals during slight acidosis and that di- and polyvalent cations are modulators of ASIC activity. cDNAs for ASIC1a and ASIC1b have been described previously (4Bässler E.L. Ngo-Anh T.J. Geisler H.S. Ruppersberg J.P. Gründer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33782-33787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Chimeric molecules between ASIC1a and ASIC1b and point mutations were constructed by recombinant PCR using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). N-terminal sequences of ASIC1b were from ASIC1b-M3 (4Bässler E.L. Ngo-Anh T.J. Geisler H.S. Ruppersberg J.P. Gründer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33782-33787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). All PCR-derived fragments were entirely sequenced. Using mMessage mMachine (Ambion, Austin, Texas), capped cRNA was synthesized by SP6 RNA polymerase from ASIC1a, ASIC1b, and chimeric cDNA, which had been linearized by SapI. We injected 10 ng of ASIC1b wild type cRNA and 0.01–0.1 ng of the other cRNAs; currents ranged from 0.5–50 μA. cRNA was injected into stage V and VI oocytes of Xenopus laevis, and oocytes were kept in OR-2 medium (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.0 mm Na2HPO4, 5.0 mm HEPES, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 g/liter polyvinylpyrrolidone) for one to 7 days. The bath solution for the two-electrode voltage clamp contained 140 mm NaCl and 10 mm HEPES; concentration of divalent cations was 1.8 mm CaCl2 and 1.0 mm MgCl2 if not otherwise indicated. Where appropriate, HEPES was replaced by MES buffer. Holding potential was −60 or −70 mV. Solutions with low concentrations of divalent cations contained 0.1 mm flufenamic acid or niflumic acid to block the large conductance induced in oocytes by divalent-free extracellular solutions. For steady-state inactivation curves and Ca2+ dose-response curves, solution exchange was gravity driven. Whole cell currents were recorded with a TurboTec 01C amplifier (NPI Electronic Instruments, Tamm, Germany), and data were stored on hard disk. For H+dose-response curves and recovery measurements, we used an automated, pump-driven solution exchange system together with the oocyte testing carousel controlled by the interface OTC-20 (NPI Electronic Instruments). Complete solution exchange at whole oocytes with this system can be obtained within less than 1 s (16Madeja M. Musshoff U. Speckmann E.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1995; 63: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Currents were recorded and filtered at 20 Hz with a TurboTec 03X amplifier (NPI Electronic Instruments) digitized at 100 Hz using the AD/DA interface PCI 1200 (National Instruments, Austin, Texas) and stored on hard disk. Data acquisition and solution exchange were managed using the CellWorks 5.1.1 software (NPI Electronic Instruments). Amiloride, collagenase, flufenamic acid, and niflumic acid were purchased from Sigma. Data was analyzed using IgorPro software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Steady-state inactivation, dose-response curves for potentiation by divalent cations, and activation by H+ were fitted using the following equation, I=a+(Imax−a)/(1+(C50/[B])n)Equation 1 where I max is the maximal current, a is the residual current, [B] is the concentration of H+ or of the divalent cation, C50 is the concentration at which half-maximal response occurs, and n is the Hill coefficient. Time constants characterizing recovery from desensitization and steady-state inactivation were determined using a monoexponential fit. Statistical analysis was done with Student's t test. All values reported represent the mean ± S.D. from nindividual measurements. Currents from individual measurements were either normalized to the I max obtained from a fit to the logistic function (1Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) or to the maximal value obtained (pH activation curves, recovery from desensitization). The mean of these normalized data from different measurements was then used to do the fit reported in the figures. Error bars on graphs indicate the standard error (except Fig. 2). Using Xenopus oocytes, we first investigated the activation of ASIC1a and ASIC1b by protons. As shown in Fig.1 A, application of an acidic solution to ASIC1 expressing oocytes elicited transient, fast activating, and completely desensitizing inward currents. Current amplitude of ASIC1a and ASIC1b increased over a pH range of 1 unit, corresponding to a 10-fold increase in agonist concentration (Fig. 1). Thus, the sensitivity of ASIC1 to its agonist is comparable with that of other ligand-gated ion channels. ASIC1b has a lower apparent affinity for H+ (EC50, pH 5.84 ± 0.09,n = 8) than ASIC1a (EC50, pH 6.56 ± 0.06, n = 11). Both values for pH of half-maximal activation are in good agreement with values obtained from measurements with smaller cells like COS-7 (5Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 8Sutherland S.P. Benson C.J. Adelman J.P. McCleskey E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) showing that activation curves can be confidently determined with whole oocytes. The Hill coefficient was slightly higher for ASIC1a compared with ASIC1b (3.24 ± 0.44 and 2.52 ± 0.47, respectively). A Hill coefficient bigger than 1 suggests cooperative binding of H+ to more than one subunit. As can be seen in Fig. 1 B, the shift in the activation curve for ASIC1b leads to an efficient activation approximately at the pH at which the activation of ASIC1a starts to saturate. We then analyzed the steady-state inactivation of ASIC1a and ASIC1b. In this study, the term inactivation rather than desensitization will be used whenever there is no macroscopic activation observable. Oocytes were superfused for 2 min in an extracellular solution with a pH ranging from 7.8 to 6.7, and channels were then activated by a constant test pH of 6.0. The steady-state inactivation curves are plotted in Fig. 1 B together with the curves for activation. The steady-state inactivation curves of both splice variants were very steep, leading to complete inactivation in a range of 0.4 pH units corresponding to a 2.5-fold increase in agonist concentration. Correspondingly, Hill coefficients were large (10.90 ± 6.15 and 8.63 ± 4.31 for ASIC1a and ASIC1b, respectively) suggesting high cooperativity for inactivation. The inactivation curves were shifted to more acidic values for ASIC1b (IC50, pH 7.00 ± 0.04,n = 10) compared with ASIC1a (IC50, pH 7.24 ± 0.05, n = 12). Such a shift would lead to the start of inactivation of ASIC1b at a pH at which ASIC1a is already almost completely inactivated (Fig. 1), suggesting that ASIC1b replaces ASIC1a when the dynamic range of ASIC1a is saturated. To determine the structural elements in the primary structure of the protein controlling apparent H+ affinity of ASIC1, we constructed a series of chimeric molecules that exchanged parts of the N terminus of ASIC1a by the corresponding part of ASIC1b (Fig. 2). These chimeras exchange the cytoplasmic N terminus, the first transmembrane domain, and various parts of the extracellular loop. All of the chimeras were functional and showed current amplitudes comparable with wild type ASIC1a. First, we determined activation by H+ for the chimeras. The activation curves of all chimeras had the same overall shape as those of the wild type with similar Hill coefficients. Although the EC50 of most chimeras did not correspond exactly to the value of either splice variant, the chimeras can be clearly divided into two groups. As can be seen from Fig. 2, currents through the chimeric channels in which up to 98 amino acids were replaced showed an EC50 comparable with ASIC1a (values for chimeras C62–C98 ranged from 6.32 to 6.85, n = 6–10). A chimera in which the first 106 amino acids were replaced, however, showed a strong shift in the EC50 to a value even lower than for ASIC1b (5.42 ± 0.10, n = 9). The EC50 for all chimeras that contained larger stretches of ASIC1b resembled the EC50 of ASIC1b (values for chimeras C112–C148 ranged from 5.52 to 6.00, n = 6–9). This suggests that amino acids from 98 to 106 are critical for determining the apparent H+ affinity of ASIC1 activation. Next, we analyzed steady-state inactivation for the chimeras. Again, half-maximal, steady-state inactivation (IC50) of most chimeras did not correspond exactly to the value of either splice variant, but they can be divided into the same two groups (Fig. 2). Chimeras C62, C76, and C92 showed half-maximal, steady-state inactivation at a pH similar to that of the ASIC1a wild type (values for chimeras C62–C92 ranged from 7.17 to 7.35, n = 8–9), whereas chimera C98 showed a significant shift of half-maximal steady-state inactivation (7.02 ± 0.02, n = 8–9). However, the other chimeras showed a much stronger shift in steady-state inactivation to pH values similar to or more acidic than ASIC1b (values for chimeras C106–C148 ranged from 6.74–6.93,n = 3–6). This is in agreement with the conclusion that the region comprising amino acids 98 to 106 of ASIC1 contains a critical element controlling the apparent affinity of the channel to H+ for both activation and steady-state inactivation. In this region only four amino acids are different between ASIC1a and ASIC1b (Fig. 2). We substituted these four amino acids in ASIC1a individually by those found in ASIC1b and determined the pH of half-maximal activation as well as steady state inactivation of the substituted variants. Variants ASIC1a F100L and V103L had values similar to ASIC1a wild type (pH 6.60 ± 0.13 and 6.64 ± 0.08 for activation and pH 7.19 ± 0.07 and 7.23 ± 0.06 for steady state inactivation, respectively, n = 8; Fig.2). The other two variants (K105Y and N106P), however, showed a significant shift of both pH activation and steady state inactivation to values similar to ASIC1b wild type (pH 6.27 ± 0.15 and 5.93 ± 0.13 for activation and pH 7.05 ± 0.02 and 6.95 ± 0.04 for steady state inactivation, respectively, n= 8; Fig. 2). These results indicate that these two residues are critical for setting the apparent H+ affinity of ASIC1. Next, we investigated the interaction of ASIC1 with divalent cations. To have constant open channel properties, we used a protocol in which we varied the Ca2+ concentration only during the conditioning period at pH 7.4 and held it constant at 1.8 mm during low pH (6.0) activation. When we increased the Ca2+ concentration during the conditioning period at pH 7.4, we observed a significant increase in ASIC1a current amplitude when pH 6.0 solution was applied (Fig.3 A). Because we used different Ca2+ concentrations during the conditioning period and low pH activation, the potentiation by Ca2+ cannot be precisely quantified. With this reservation, we observed half-maximal potentiation around the physiological concentration of Ca2+(EC50, 2.10 ± 0.29 mm, n= 8; figure 3), suggesting that this interaction with Ca2+is of physiological relevance. We observed a similar potentiation of currents through ASIC1a by both Ba2+ and Mg2+(EC50, 2.90 ± 0.52 and 1.99 ± 0.69 mm, respectively, n = 7–8; figure 3). The Hill-coefficient for the potentiation by divalent cations was ∼2 (2.45, 2.50, and 2.01 for Ca2+, Ba2+, and Mg2+, respectively), suggesting that more than one ion is necessary to potentiate the current. Potentiation was voltage independent (data not shown) suggesting a binding site outside the membrane electric field. Under identical conditions, ASIC1b currents were only slightly potentiated by Ca2+ (Fig.3 B). We then addressed whether extracellular Ca2+ changes the affinity of the channel to H+. Low extracellular concentrations of divalent cations (0.1 mm Ca2+, 0 mmMg2+) during the conditioning period did not significantly shift the pH dose-response curve for ASIC1a and ASIC1b (EC50 = 6.53 ± 0.11, n = 11, and 5.86 ± 0.08, n = 7, respectively; Fig.4 A). For ASIC1a, at any given pH there was an increase in current amplitude with high concentrations of divalent cations compared with low concentrations (Fig.4 A, inset). Thus, Ca2+ potentiation is not due to a shift in the pH activation curve. We then decreased Ca2+ concentration during low pH activation (0.1 mm Ca2+) and held it constant (1.8 mm Ca2+, 1.0 mm Mg2+) in the conditioning period at pH 7.4. Under these conditions, we observed a shift in the pH activation curve to a lower agonist concentration for ASIC1a (EC50 = 6.83 ± 0.02,n = 8, p ≪ 0.01; Fig. 4 B) and to a lesser extent for ASIC1b (EC50 = 5.95 ± 0.12,n = 8, p = 0.05; Fig. 4 B). The shift of the activation curve during activation but not steady-state suggests fast on and off rates of Ca2+ at this modulating site. The observed shift of the activation curve would lead to an inhibition by Ca2+ during low pH activation, which has already been reported for ASIC3 (17Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 869-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). This inhibition by Ca2+ reveals a complex interaction of ASICs with divalent cations. Next, steady-state inactivation curves were determined with low concentrations of divalent cations (0.1 mmCa2+) between activation steps. For both splice variants, there was a significant shift of the steady-state inactivation curves by about 0.2 pH units to higher pH values (IC50, 7.48 ± 0.07 for ASIC1a, n = 12, and 7.22 ± 0.04 for ASIC1b, n = 10, p ≪ 0.01; Fig.4 C) compared with normal concentrations of divalent cations. This shift of the steady-state inactivation curves will lead to a significantly lower number of available ASIC1a channels at pH 7.4 and low concentrations of extracellular divalent cations. This accounts for the current potentiation by Ca2+ at this pH. Because the steady-state inactivation curve for ASIC1b is shifted to more acidic values compared with ASIC1a, this suggests that ASIC1b may be potentiated by Ca2+ at a more acidic conditioning pH. In fact, at a conditioning pH of 7.1 we observed a strong potentiation for ASIC1b also (Fig. 4 D). At this pH, current amplitude rose with increasing Ca2+ concentration. Half-maximal potentiation was reached at a Ca2+ concentration similar to ASIC1a (2.00 ± 0.68 mm, n = 9), suggesting: (i) a conserved binding site for Ca2+; and (ii) a physiologic relevance for Ca2+ potentiation of ASIC1b. Because Ca2+ potentiation of ASIC1b can be seen only at a slightly acidic resting pH, ASIC1b is a more effective sensor of transient H+ signals during slight acidosis. The shift in the steady-state inactivation curves by divalent cations can be explained either by a difference in the rate of recovery from desensitization and/or by a difference in the rate of steady-state inactivation. First, we determined time constants of recovery. We used a conditioning pH of 7.4. At this pH value we did not observe significant steady-state inactivation for ASIC1b with both low and normal concentrations of divalent cations (see Fig. 3); for ASIC1a we observed substantial inactivation at pH 7.4, but recovery at pH 7.7 was too fast (complete in less than 3 s) to be reliably determined. Time constants of recovery were similar for ASIC1a and ASIC1b under physiological concentrations of divalent cations (5.23 ± 2.37 s, n = 27, and 7.66 ± 1.87 s, n = 24, respectively; Fig.5 A). With low concentrations of divalent cations (0.3 mm Ca2+), we observed a significantly slower recovery from desensitization for both ASIC1a and ASIC1b (15.39 ± 14.14 s, n = 23, and 17.03 ± 3.96 s, n = 19, respectively,p < 0.01). The time constant of the onset of steady-state inactivation was determined by a varying period at pH 7.05 (ASIC1a) or 6.5 (ASIC1b) and normal concentrations of divalent cations or a varying period at pH 7.15 or 6.6 and low concentrations of divalent cations. These pH values were chosen to have maximal inactivation without significant activation (see Fig. 1 B). The number of available channels was then assessed by a short (3.5 s) test pulse of pH 6.0, after which channels were allowed to recover from inactivation for 100 s at pH 7.4 (Fig. 5 B). With low concentrations of divalent cations (0.3 mm Ca2+), we observed a significantly faster steady-state inactivation for ASIC1a and a slightly faster inactivation for ASIC1b (ASIC1a, 14.08 ± 3.99 s,n = 13, compared with 78.92 ± 54.48 s,n = 16, respectively, p ≪ 0.01; ASIC1b, 38.95 ± 8.63 s, n = 23, compared with 47.48 ± 18.88 s, n = 18, respectively,p = 0.06). Thus, Ca2+ seems to favor the resting state of the channel, thereby increasing the rate of recovery as well as slowing the rate of inactivation during steady-state. Both mechanisms work in concert to increase the number of available channels during steady-state, which explains the shift in the steady-state inactivation curves. The extracellular concentration of the polyvalent cation spermine can significantly vary, and it has been shown that spermine modulates different ion channels. Potentiation of ASIC1 currents by divalent cations led us to ask whether spermine also interacts with ASIC1. We determined steady-state inactivation in the presence of 0.25 mm spermine and 0.1 mm Ca2+ during the conditioning period. As can be seen in Fig.6, 0.25 mm spermine led to a significant shift of the steady-state inactivation curves of both ASIC1a and ASIC1b. This shift was in the order of 0.2 pH units (half-maximal inactivation at pH 7.25 ± 0.03 for ASIC1a and 7.04 ± 0.03 for ASIC1b, n = 9), showing that currents through both splice variants can be strongly potentiated by spermine and that interaction with spermine significantly extends the dynamic range of ASIC1. Our study has two key findings. 1) ASIC1b is an effective sensor of transient H+ signals under slight acidosis, extending the dynamic range of ASIC1. 2) We show that extracellular di- and polyvalent cations interact with ASIC1, leading to a potentiation of the current. Our results indicate that agonist sensitivity is the major difference between ASIC1a and 1b. We show that ASIC1b can still function at a resting pH down to 6.9, which is of special importance because ASIC1b is specifically expressed in sensory neurons (5Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). This property may, thus, enable ASIC1b to sense acidic transients even under conditions of slight acidosis, for example during inflammation. The finding that Ca2+ potentiation of ASIC1b is efficient only at a resting pH below 7.15 additionally shows that ASIC1b has its full operational capacity only at slightly acidic resting pH. ASIC1a is expressed in the dorsal root ganglion mainly in small diameter neurons (5Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar, 14Olson T.H. Riedl M.S. Vulchanova L. Ortiz-Gonzalez X.R. Elde R. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas ASIC1b is expressed in both small and large diameter neurons (5Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Whether both splice variants are co-expressed in some small-diameter neurons is at present unknown. Irrespective of differential expression, our results suggest that alternative splicing at the ASIC1gene increases the operational range of H+ receptors in sensory neurons. Alvarez de la Rosa et al. (15Alvarez De La Rosa D. Zhang P. Shao D. White F. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2326-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) recently reported an EC50 value for activation by H+ of ASIC1a expressed in Xenopus oocytes that is substantially higher (pH 5.3) than the value we obtained. ASIC1 activates within few msec (4Bässler E.L. Ngo-Anh T.J. Geisler H.S. Ruppersberg J.P. Gründer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33782-33787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and, therefore, fast solution exchange is essential for concerted activation of ASICs. This is especially relevant for large cells likeXenopus oocytes. One possible explanation for lower agonist affinity reported in their study is, thus, slow solution exchange in their experimental set-up. Our results point to an important role for extracellular Ca2+ in modulation of neuronal receptor channels. The Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR), a G-protein-coupled cell-surface receptor for divalent cations, is activated by Ca2+ over a concentration range of 0.5 mm to 10 mm (18Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar, 19Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ASIC1 has a Ca2+ sensitivity comparable with the CaR, which is specialized in the sensing of extracellular Ca2+. The CaR has a role in body homeostasis of Ca2+ but is also significantly expressed in different brain regions, suggesting that fluctuations of extracellular Ca2+ concentrations do occur in the brain. In a recent elegant study, Hofer et al. have shown that mobilization of Ca2+ in one cell will lead to extrusion of Ca2+ and concurrent activation of neighboring cells expressing the CaR (20Hofer A.M. Curci S. Doble M.A. Brown E.M. Soybel D.I. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This suggests that there is a form of intercellular communication using extracellular Ca2+. In addition to these local changes in Ca2+ concentration, experiments with Ca2+ selective microelectrodes have revealed more global changes in Ca2+ concentration in the brain during neuronal activity (21Benninger C. Kadis J. Prince D.A. Brain Res. 1980; 187: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 22Nicholson C. Bruggencate G.T. Steinberg R. Stockle H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1287-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 23Pumain R. Heinemann U. J. Neurophysiol. 1985; 53: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The extracellular Ca2+ concentration can decrease from a resting value around 1.2 mm to values as low as 0.08 mm in extreme conditions (22Nicholson C. Bruggencate G.T. Steinberg R. Stockle H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1287-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although Ca2+ concentrations usually decreased by only about one fourth of the resting concentration, local changes may well be higher. In the skin it has been shown that there is a standing gradient of extracellular Ca2+ (24Menon G.K. Grayson S. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 508-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and it has been proposed that tissue injury may cause a spread of high Ca2+ from the outer epidermis to the inner epidermis (25Cook S.P. Rodland K.D. McCleskey E.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9238-9244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which would then increase the number of available ASIC1. Chelation of divalent cations by metabolites like lactate may also contribute to variations in the extracellular concentration of divalent cations (17Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 869-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentration at which half-maximal potentiation of ASIC1 occurred (EC50, about 2 mm) matches well with the resting concentration of these ions. Therefore, small variations in the physiologic extracellular Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ concentration will have significant effects on channel activity. The inhibition of ASIC1 by Ca2+ during H+-activation and the potentiation in the steady-state endows this channel with the property to translate the time when Ca2+ concentration changes into two opposing effects. Changes in Ca2+ concentration both in the conditioning period and during low-pH activation have only a small net effect on channel activity (results not shown), adding to the possible responses of ASICs to changes in extracellular Ca2+ concentration. Natural polyamines, spermine, spermidine and putrescine, are synthesized and released upon brain trauma (26Fage D. Voltz C. Scatton B. Carter C. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 2170-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Paschen W. Widmann R. Weber C. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 135: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The concentration of spermine in secretory granules and nerve terminals from ox neurohypophyses has been calculated to be 0.26 and 0.52 mm, respectively (28Kroigaard M. Thams P. Thorn N.A. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 146: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Our results show that concentrations of spermine similar to these physiological values shift the steady-state inactivation curve of ASIC1, which would increase the number of available channels. Increasing the number of available channels would be especially relevant during tissue acidosis and may contribute to increased excitotoxicity during seizures and ischemia when the extracellular pH falls. A more detailed analysis will show whether spermine acts through the same or a different mechanism than divalent cations and what the apparent affinity is of ASIC1 for polyvalent cations. ASICs share the property of Ca2+ potentiation with P2X receptors (25Cook S.P. Rodland K.D. McCleskey E.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9238-9244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (29Mulle C. Lena C. Changeux J.P. Neuron. 1992; 8: 937-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and metabotropic glutamate receptors (30Kubo Y. Miyashita T. Murata Y. Science. 1998; 279: 1722-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). They also share the property of Mg2+potentiation with the NMDA receptor (31Paoletti P. Neyton J. Ascher P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1109-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This underlines the relevance of potentiation. Potentiation of P2X3 receptors by Ca2+ is especially interesting because P2X3 is an ion channel that is specifically expressed in small-diameter sensory neurons. P2X3 currents are potentiated by speeding recovery from desensitization, and potentiation has the special property of endowing P2X3, which shows a very slow (> 5 min) recovery, with a memory for Ca2+ transients (25Cook S.P. Rodland K.D. McCleskey E.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9238-9244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because recovery of ASIC1 is much faster and, additionally, the memory will vanish because of steady-state inactivation, the memory for Ca2+transients during steady-state will be short (several seconds) for ASIC1. The most likely explanation of the potentiation by Ca2+ and other di- and polyvalent cations is a direct competitive binding with H+to a common binding site. Alternatively, there may be a distinct binding site for di- and polyvalent cations, which would change the affinity at the H+ binding site. The H+ sensor or ligand binding domain of ASICs is unknown. It has been suggested that His-72 may be involved in activation of ASIC2a (32Baron A. Schaefer L. Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35361-35367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, this residue is not the ligand binding site of ASIC1 or ASIC3 (32Baron A. Schaefer L. Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35361-35367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that residues 105 and 106 of ASIC1a are critical in modulating the pKa of the H+ binding site. We propose that they are contained within a pocket creating an altered electrostatic environment thereby changing pKa of the H+ binding site. This does not necessarily imply that they are close to the H+ binding site in the primary structure of the channel. The similar EC50 of Ca2+ potentiation of ASIC1a and ASIC1b suggests a conserved binding site for Ca2+. Negatively charged amino acids are the best candidates to contribute to this Ca2+ binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis will show whether any of the numerous aspartates/glutamates in the extracellular loop of ASICs are involved in Ca2+ binding and if these residues constitute also the H+ sensor. The fact that steady-state inactivation occurs at a pH at which there is no macroscopic activation has been taken as evidence that the inactivated state can be reached without prior opening of the channel (7Benson C.J. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 15Alvarez De La Rosa D. Zhang P. Shao D. White F. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2326-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, models where the channel has to open before inactivation occurs cannot be ruled out. Our results (not shown) indicate that time constant of recovery from steady-state inactivation is not significantly different from time constant of recovery from desensitization suggesting that there is only one type of inactivated state and we favor a simple model where closed, open and inactivated states are linearly connected. In summary, our results show that ASIC1b is still active at more acidic resting pH than ASIC1a, suggesting that it is a sensor of transient H+ signals during slight acidosis. Moreover, we show that di- and polyvalent cations modulate gating of ASIC1, which may link ASIC activity to the extracellular concentrations of these ions. We thank M. Pusch, J. P. Ruppersberg, and T. Nicolson for comments on the manuscript, A. Rüsch for help with the data analysis, and S. N. Skachkov for suggesting spermine as an extracellular modulator of ASICs. We also thank H.-P. Zenner for generous support of this study."
https://openalex.org/W2086777267,"Recent studies have shown that phox homology (PX) domains act as phosphoinositide-binding motifs. The majority of PX domains studied show binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate (PtdIns(3)P), an association that allows the host protein to localize to membranes of the endocytic pathway. One issue, however, is whether PX domains may have alternative phosphoinositide binding specificities that could target their host protein to distinct subcellular compartments or allow their allosteric regulation by phosphoinositides other than PtdIns(3)P. It has been reported that the PX domain of sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) specifically binds phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>) (Zhong, Q., Lazar, C. S., Tronchere, H., Sato, T., Meerloo, T., Yeo, M., Songyang, Z., Emr, S. D., and Gill, G. N. (2002)<i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.</i> 99, 6767–6772). In the present study, we have shown that whereas SNX1 binds PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> in protein:lipid overlay assays, in liposomes-based assays, binding is observed to PtdIns(3)P and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>) but not to PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. To address the significance of PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> binding, we examined the subcellular localization of SNX1 under conditions in which plasma membrane PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> levels were significantly elevated. Under these conditions, we failed to observe association of SNX1 with this membrane. However, consistent with the binding to PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> being of more physiological significance was the observation that the association of SNX1 with an early endosomal compartment was dependent on a 3-phosphoinositide-binding PX domain and the presence of PtdIns(3)P on this compartment. Finally, we have shown that the PX domain-dependent/early endosomal association of SNX1 is important for its ability to regulate the targeting of internalized epidermal growth factor receptor for lysosomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2000718683,"Human neutrophil granulocytes die rapidly, and their survival is contingent upon rescue from programmed cell death by signals from the environment. Here we report that a novel signal for delaying neutrophil apoptosis is the classic acute phase reactant, C-reactive protein (CRP). However, this anti-apoptotic activity is expressed only when the cyclic pentameric structure of CRP is lost, resulting in formation of modified or monomeric CRP (mCRP), which may be formed in inflamed tissues. By contrast, native pentameric CRP and CRP peptides 77–82, 174–185, and 201–206 failed to affect neutrophil apoptosis. The apoptosis delaying action of mCRP was markedly attenuated by an antibody against the low affinity IgG immune complex receptor (CD16) but not by an anti-CD32 antibody. mCRP evoked a transient concurrent activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways, leading to inhibition of caspase-3 and consequently to delaying apoptosis. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of either ERK or Akt reversed the anti-apoptotic action of mCRP; however, they did not produce additive inhibition. Thus, mCRP, but not pentameric CRP or peptides derived from CRP, promotes neutrophil survival and may therefore contribute to amplification of the inflammatory response.

Migration of neutrophil granulocytes into tissues during inflammation is intimately linked to their activation for functional activity as well as cell survival. Mature human neutrophils have the shortest life span among leukocytes and die rapidly via apoptosisin vitro and, apparently, in vivo (1Savill J.S. Wyllie A.H. Henson J.E. Walport M.J. Henson P.M.

This constitutively expressed program may serve to render neutrophils functionally ineffective before their removal by scavenger macrophages (3Whyte M.K.B. Meagher L.C. Macdermot J. Haslett C. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5124-5134Google Scholar). However, the life span of mature neutrophils can be extended significantly within the inflammatory microenvironment by bacterial products (2Colotta F., Re, F. Polentarutti N. Sozzani S. Mantovani A.

The regulation of neutrophil apoptosis during the acute phase of inflammation is less well defined, yet it is critical to the optimal expression and resolution of inflammation.

Despite extensive studies spanning several decades, the exact role and mechanism of action of CRP as a modulator of inflammation has not been well defined, as both pro- and anti-inflammatory actions have been reported (8Kushner I.

These apparently contradictory results might be explained by formation of distinct species of CRP during inflammation. In general, the effects of native, pentameric CRP on neutrophils are largely inhibitory. CRP binds primarily to the low affinity IgG FcγRIIa (CD32) and to some extent to the high affinity IgG FcγRI (CD64) (16Bharadwaj D Stein M.P. Volzer M. Mold C. Du Clos T.W. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 585-590Google Scholar, 17Marnell L.L. Mold C. Volzer M.A. Burlingame R.W. Du Clos T.W. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2185-2193Google Scholar, 18Stein M.P. Edberg J.C. Kimberly R.P. Mangan E.K. Bharadwaj D. Mold C. Du Clos T.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 369-376Google Scholar). Neutrophils exposed to native CRP show depressed functional activities, including degranulation (19Filep J. Földes-Filep E. Life. Sci. 1989; 44: 517-524Google Scholar), generation of superoxide by the inducible respiratory burst (19Filep J. Földes-Filep E. Life. Sci. 1989; 44: 517-524Google Scholar), adherence to endothelial cells (15Zouki C. Beauchamp M. Baron C. Filep J.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 522-529Google Scholar), and migration into tissues (13Heuertz R.M. Webster R.O. Mol. Med. Today. 1997; : 539-545Google Scholar). Conformationally altered and/or proteolytic forms of CRP express several epitopes that are not present on native CRP (20Ying S-C. Gewurz H. Kinoshita C.M. Potempa L.A. Siegel J.N. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 221-228Google Scholar) and display properties distinct from those of native CRP (21Potempa L.A. Siegel J.N. Fiedel B.A. Potempa R.T. Gewurz H. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 531-541Google Scholar). Native, pentameric CRP can be dissociated into free subunits in vitro (21Potempa L.A. Siegel J.N. Fiedel B.A. Potempa R.T. Gewurz H. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 531-541Google Scholar). These subunits expressing several neoepitopes are referred to as modified or monomeric CRP (mCRP). mCRP antigens were detected in inflamed rabbit tissues (22Rees R.F. Gewurz H. Siegel J.N. Coon J. Potempa L.A. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1988; 48: 95-107Google Scholar) as well as in the wall of human normal blood vessels (23Diehl E.E. Haines G.K. Radosevich J.A. Potempa L.A. Am. J. Med. Sci. 2000; 319: 79-83Google Scholar). Unlike native CRP, mCRP binds to the low affinity IgG immune complex FcγRIIIb 2G. P. Schneider, R. M. Heuertz, L. A. Potempa, and R. O. Webster, personal communication. and enhances neutrophil adhesiveness to endothelial cells via up-regulation of the expression of CD11b/C18 on the neutrophil surface (24Zouki C. Haas B. Chan J.S.D. Potempa L.A. Filep J.G. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5355-5361Google Scholar). Exposure of CRP to membrane-bound serine proteases leads to cleavage of biologically active peptides, which mimic the actions of native CRP on neutrophil chemotaxis (25Shephard E.G. Anderson R. Rosen O. Myer M.S. Friedkin M. Strachan A.F. de Beer F.C. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1469-1476Google Scholar) and adhesion to endothelial cells (15Zouki C. Beauchamp M. Baron C. Filep J.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 522-529Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether CRP, mCRP, or peptides derived from CRP could prolong neutrophil life span via inhibition of apoptosis. High purity (>99%) human native CRP (Calbiochem) was stored in buffers containing CaCl2 to prevent the spontaneous formation of monomeric CRP from the native CRP pentamer. mCRP was prepared from native CRP by urea chelation (21Potempa L.A. Siegel J.N. Fiedel B.A. Potempa R.T. Gewurz H. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 531-541Google Scholar). By electron microscopy analysis, mCRP molecules in the absence of added salt associates into a diffuse matrix very distinct from the annular pentameric disk that is defined for native CRP (27Motie M. Brockmeister S. Potempa L.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4435-4441Google Scholar). The secondary structure of native CRP has been estimated using x-ray crystallography (28Shrive A.K. Cheetham G.M.T. Holden D. Myles D.A.A. Turnell W.G. Volanakis J.E. Pepys M.B. Bloomer A.C. Greenhough T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 346-354Google Scholar) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (29Dong A. Caughey W.S. DuClos T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6424-6430Google Scholar) as 50% β-sheet, 12% helix, 24% β-turn, and 14% unordered structure. A preliminary evaluation of mCRP secondary structure using circular dichroism and a self-consistent method (Selcon) for estimating structures (30Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Google Scholar) revealed mCRP to have 50–51% helix, 2–12% β-sheet, 20–23% β-turn, and 12–20% random structure. These data indicate that a significant secondary structural change occurs when mCRP is formed from CRP, changing from predominantly β-sheet structure to an α-helical structure. A recombinant form of mCRP (rmCRP) with both cysteine residues mutated to alanine residues (i.e. Cys36→ Ala; Cys97 → Ala) and with an added N-terminal formylmethionine residue was expressed in Escherichia coliand was isolated from inclusion bodies to >95% purity (26Potempa, L. A., Liao, H., and Crump, B. L. (February 23, 1999) U. S. Patent 5,874,238.Google Scholar). To enhance solubility, rmCRP was acylated with maleic anhydride or citraconic anhydride. Cysteine-mutated rmCRP was directly comparable with mCRP produced from the native CRP pentamer by urea chelation in the following ways. (a) SDS-PAGE analysis showed that both rmCRP and mCRP proteins displayed one predominant protein with an apparent molecular weight of 22,976, identical to that of a native CRP subunit. (b) Amino acid composition analysis (Analytical Biotechnology Services, Boston, MA) showed that rmCRP contained the same number of amino acid residues per mol of protein as mCRP with the exception of 11 alanine residues per mol of rmCRP compared with 9 per mol of mCRP, no cysteine residues in rmCRP versus 2 cysteine residues per mol of mCRP and 3 methionine residues per mol of rmCRP compared with 2 in mCRP, corroborating the changes engineered in rmCRP. (c) The N-terminal sequence analysis of rmCRP (pulsed liquid sequencer with an in-line phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analyzer, Analytical Biotechnology Services, Boston, MA) determined a sequence, MQTDMSRKAFVFPKE, that exactly corresponds to the sequence established for the CRP subunit (31Lei K.-J. Liu T. Zon G. Soravia E. Liu T.-Y. Goldman N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13377-13383Google Scholar, 32Woo P. Korenberg J.R. Whitehead A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13384-13388Google Scholar). (d) Monoclonal antibodies directed to the C-terminal octapeptide (residues 199–206) of the CRP subunit (clone 3H12 or 9C9) (20Ying S-C. Gewurz H. Kinoshita C.M. Potempa L.A. Siegel J.N. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 221-228Google Scholar) react with the same specificity and affinity to mCRP, rmCRP (33Shields M.J. Siegel J.N. Clark C.R. Hines K.K. Potempa L.A. Gewurz H. Anderson B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 141: 253-261Google Scholar), and acylated forms of rmCRP. Furthermore, preliminary experiments showed that, on a molar basis, mCRP and rmCRP and acylated forms of rmCRP produced similar delays in neutrophil apoptosis assessed by annexin V and acridine orange staining (see below). Therefore, because of the enhanced solubility and the similarity in biochemical characteristics, most results described in this report were obtained with maleic anhydride-acylated rmCRP. CRP peptides 77–82, 174–185, and 201–206 (purity >98%) were obtained from Sigma. The endotoxin levels of CRP, mCRP, rmCRP, and CRP peptide solutions were below the detection limit (0.125 enzyme units/ml, corresponding to ∼0.01 ng/ml Ec5) of the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (E-Toxate, Sigma). Neutrophils were isolated from venous blood of healthy volunteers (male and female, 22–48 years), who had not taken any drugs for at least 14 days before the experiments (15Zouki C. Beauchamp M. Baron C. Filep J.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 522-529Google Scholar). The protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Committee of the Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital. Neutrophils (5 × 106 cells/ml, purity >97%, viability >98%) were resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 10% autologous plasma, and incubated with native or modified CRP or peptides derived from CRP in 0.5 ml conical polypropylene tubes on a rotator (Adams Nutator) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. In additional experiments, neutrophils were preincubated with 50 μm PD98059, 2 μm wortmannin, 1 μm SB 203580, anti-CD16 Ab 3G8, anti-CD62 Ab FLI8.26 or the irrelevant Ab MOPC-21 (each at 2.5 μg/ml, Pharmingen) for 20 min before addition of mCRP. At the indicated times, cells were washed once in Hanks' balanced salt solution before use in the assays described below. Percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated by examining acridine orange-stained neutrophils (at least 300 cells/sample) for morphologic features characteristic for apoptosis (diminution of cell volume, fragmented or bright, homogeneously stained nuclei) on a Leitz fluorescence microscope (34Filep J.G. Baron C. Lachance S. Perreault C. Chan J.S.D. Blood. 1996; 87: 5136-5143Google Scholar). Standard cytospin preparations were stained with Wright-Giemsa dye for photographic demonstration of apoptotic morphologic features. Neutrophil apoptosis was quantitated as the percent of cells with hypodiploid DNA (35Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Google Scholar) and positive annexin V staining (36Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Google Scholar). Neutrophils (∼106) were suspended in 0.5 ml of hypotonic fluorochrome solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide in 0.1% sodium citrate plus 0.1% Triton X-100) immediately before analysis. Propidium iodide fluorescence of individual nuclei was measured using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). 10,000 events were acquired per sample. For specific annexin V binding, neutrophils (106) were incubated in 100 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) containing a saturating concentration of phycoerythrin-labeled annexin V for 15 min at 20 °C and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline before analysis by flow cytometry. Nonspecific binding was determined by using calcium-free binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). DNA cleavage was shown by quantification of fractional solubilized (low molecular weight) DNA by diphenylamine assay (37Park J.R. Robertson K. Hickstein D.D. Tsai S. Hockenbery D.M. Collins S.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 440-445Google Scholar) and gel electrophoresis (34Filep J.G. Baron C. Lachance S. Perreault C. Chan J.S.D. Blood. 1996; 87: 5136-5143Google Scholar). For the diphenylamine assay, data are reported as the percentage of soluble, low molecular weight DNA. For DNA electrophoresis, DNA was extracted from neutrophils, precipitated, and resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer containing 25 μg/ml RNase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), incubated for 5 min at 65 °C, and then subjected to electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose at 80 V for 70 min (34Filep J.G. Baron C. Lachance S. Perreault C. Chan J.S.D. Blood. 1996; 87: 5136-5143Google Scholar). After staining with ethidium bromide, DNA was visualized by UV examination for image analysis. Cell lysates, prepared from 107 neutrophils, were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 200 μl of assay buffer containing 28 μm N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AMC (BD Biosciences). Release of AMC from Ac-DEVD-AMC was measured using a CytoFluor microplate reader (PE Biosystems) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 460 nm, respectively. Cleavage of pro-caspase-3 was assessed by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody (Pharmingen) that recognizes both the 32-kDa unprocessed pro-caspase-3 and the 17-kDa subunit of the active caspase-3. Protein extracts were prepared by lysing 2 × 106 neutrophils in 100 μl of lysis buffer, and Western blot analysis of phosphorylated ERK 1/2, p38 MAPK, and Akt was performed using the Phospho Plus ERK 1/2, p38 MAPK, and Akt Ab kits (New England Biolabs) as described (38Zouki C. Zhang S.-L. Chan J.S.D. Filep J.G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 25-27Google Scholar). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made by analysis of variance using ranks (Kruskal-Wallis test) followed by Dunn's multiple contrast hypothesis test to identify differences between various treatments.p values < 0.05 were considered significant for all tests. Control (untreated) neutrophils developed prominent morphologic features of apoptosis including loss of membrane asymmetry (assessed by annexin V binding), diminution in cell volume, chromatin condensation, and internucleosomal cleavage of DNA, resulting in hypodiploid nuclei, within 24 h of culture. Modified CRP inhibited the development of apoptotic morphology at each of the time points studied (Figs.1 and 2). The concentration required to inhibit neutrophil apoptosis by 50% (EC50) was 6–8 μg/ml (0.26–0.35 μm) (Figs. 1 b, 2 c, and 2 e). The maximum inhibition that can be achieved with mCRP (50 μg/ml) was similar to that seen with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 μg/ml) (Fig.2 a). Although mCRP-treated cells generally retained a non-apoptotic morphologic appearance after 24–48 h in culture, nuclear condensation and decreased cell volume were evident in ∼70% of neutrophils by 72 h. By contrast, neither native CRP nor CRP peptide 201–206 affected significantly annexinV binding (Fig.1 b) and the percentage of cells with apoptotic morphology (data not shown). Likewise, CRP peptides 77–84 and 174–185 were also ineffective (data not shown). Thus, among the CRP proteins/peptides tested, only mCRP appears to delay apoptosis in neutrophils. Furthermore, the apoptosis-delaying action of mCRP can also be observed in an environment containing an excess of native CRP. For instance, 5 μg/ml mCRP reduced the percentage of annexin V-positive neutrophils from 49.4 ± 7.9% to 19.9 ± 4.0% or 20.8 ± 3.5% in the absence or presence of 50 μg/ml native CRP, respectively, after 24 h of culture (n = 3).Figure 2mCRP delays neutrophil apoptosis. a, morphologic features of neutrophils maintained in suspension culture.

The results are representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because DNA fragmentation is considered to be a hallmark of apoptosis, we performed a quantitative assay of DNA fragmentation. Neutrophils cultured for 24 h showed a dramatic increase in the amount of low molecular weight DNA from a control value of 2% (in freshly isolated neutrophils) to 32% (p < 0.01). Neutrophils cultured with mCRP showed marked decreases in the proportion of low molecular weight (soluble) DNA (Fig. 2 f). The effect of mCRP was concentration-dependent with an EC50 value of 10 μg/ml. Electrophoretic analysis confirmed the ability of mCRP to inhibit DNA fragmentation in neutrophils (Fig. 2 g). The effects of 20 and 100 μg/ml mCRP were comparable with those of 1 μg/ml LPS (Fig. 2 g). We used function-blocking antibodies (Abs) to CD16 and CD32 (FcγRIIa) as competitors to determine the IgG receptor subtype responsible for the apoptosis-delaying action of mCRP. mCRP-induced decreases in annexin V binding and percentage of neutrophils with apoptotic morphology were markedly attenuated in the presence of anti-CD16 Ab (Fig. 3). Neither the anti-CD32 Ab nor the irrelevant Ab MOPC-21 affected the mCRP inhibition (Fig. 3). None of the Abs by themselves affected neutrophil apoptosis (data not shown). To assess the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the apoptosis-delaying action of mCRP, we studied the activation of various MAP kinases known to regulate cell survival. Neutrophils incubated with mCRP induced a transient, time- and concentration-dependent increase in phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and Akt relative to unstimulated controls (Fig. 4, a and b). Phosphorylation of both ERK and Akt was rapid in onset, reaching a peak at around 2 min. The relative degree of ERK and Akt phosphorylation induced by formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (100 nm) is shown for comparison (Fig. 4 b). In vitro culture of neutrophils was associated with a sustained activation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 4 c). Enhanced p38 MAPK phosphorylation was detected as early as at 2 h of culture and was not blocked by either mCRP or LPS (Fig. 4 c). To assess the role of Akt, ERK, and p38 MAPK in mCRP-affected neutrophil apoptosis, we used the selective MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059, the PI 3-kinase (the upstream regulator of Akt activation) inhibitor wortmannin, and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580. Neither PD98059 nor wortmannin alone affected development of neutrophil apoptosis, whereas SB 203580 significantly inhibited the percentage of annexin V-positive cells (p < 0.01 compared with untreated control) and the percentage of neutrophils exhibiting hypodiploid nuclei (Fig. 4 d). By contrast, both PD98059 and wortmannin effectively attenuated the inhibitory actions of mCRP, albeit complete reversal was never observed. The effects of PD98059 and wortmannin were not additive (Fig. 4 d), indicating the mCRP effect is acting through a common downstream regulatory element. Combination of mCRP with SB 203580 did not result in a greater degree of inhibition of neutrophil apoptotic features than those observed with mCRP or SB 203580 alone (Fig. 4 d). Caspase-3 activity was barely detectable in freshly isolated neutrophils, whereas in vitro culture of neutrophils for 24 h induced significant increases in caspase-3 formation and activity (Fig.5). Cleavage of pro-caspase-3 was confirmed by Western blotting, which also demonstrated a pronounced increase in the 17-kDa active form of caspase-3 (Fig. 5 a). Cleavage of pro-caspase-3 as well as caspase-3 activity were effectively reduced by mCRP in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 5, a and b, respectively). PD98059 and wortmannin attenuated the caspase-3 inhibitory action of mCRP (Fig.5 c). However, complete reversal was not achieved, not even with the combination of PD98059 and wortmannin. Progression to apoptosis appears to be the normal default state for neutrophils, and cell survival is contingent upon rescue of cells from programmed cell death by signals from the environment. We describe in this report that a novel signal for delaying neutrophil apoptosis is the prototypical acute phase reactant CRP. However, this action is “hidden” in native CRP and is expressed only when the pentameric structure dissociates and undergoes a conformational rearrangement. A growing body of evidence indicates that distinct species of CRP are formed during inflammation. Pentameric native CRP is synthesized and secreted mainly by hepatocytes into the blood (8Kushner I. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 163: 373-383Google Scholar, 9Gabay C. Kushner I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 448-454Google Scholar). Pentameric CRP can be dissociated into free subunits through non-enzymatic chemical manipulations in vitro (21) and is apparently formed in vivo by a yet unidentified mechanism. Recent studies suggested that binding of native CRP to phosphorylcholine monolayers induces dissociation and rearrangement of the subunits of native CRP, leading to exposure of an intersubunit domain (39Wong H.-W. Sui S.-F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 75-79Google Scholar). Intersubunit contact residues of native CRP include residues 115–123, 40–42, and 197–202 (28Shrive A.K. Cheetham G.M.T. Holden D. Myles D.A.A. Turnell W.G. Volanakis J.E. Pepys M.B. Bloomer A.C. Greenhough T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 346-354Google Scholar), the latter sequence of which is a predominant epitope of mCRP (20Ying S-C. Gewurz H. Kinoshita C.M. Potempa L.A. Siegel J.N. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 221-228Google Scholar). The biochemical properties of the free subunits of CRP formed in vivo have not yet been described. Intriguingly, mCRP cross-reactive epitopes have been reported in vascular tissues (23Diehl E.E. Haines G.K. Radosevich J.A. Potempa L.A. Am. J. Med. Sci. 2000; 319: 79-83Google Scholar), inflamed rabbit liver and muscle (22Rees R.F. Gewurz H. Siegel J.N. Coon J. Potempa L.A. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1988; 48: 95-107Google Scholar), monocytes (40Kolb-Bachofen V. Puchta-Tendt N. Engenhofer C. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 122-127Google Scholar), and islet cells (41Fehsel K. Plewe D. Kolb-Bachofen V. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 254-262Google Scholar). In addition, the genetic message for CRP subunit is expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (40Kolb-Bachofen V. Puchta-Tendt N. Engenhofer C. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 122-127Google Scholar, 42Murphy T.M. Baum L.L. Beaman K.D. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 495-498Google Scholar), alveolar macrophages (43Dong Q. Wright J.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4815-4820Google Scholar), islet cells (41Fehsel K. Plewe D. Kolb-Bachofen V. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 254-262Google Scholar), and epithelial cells of the respiratory tract (44Gould J.N. Weisner J.N. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1747-1754Google Scholar). Hence, the mCRP used in the present studies may be similar, if not identical, to a naturally occurring isomeric form of CRP found in various tissues and cells throughout the body. CRP and/or mCRP may be cleaved at one or more of three tuftsin-like (Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg) regions in CRP and mCRP, resulting in the release of biologically active peptides (45Robey F.A. Ohura K. Futaki S. Fujii N. Yajima H. Goldman N.D. Jones K.D. Wahl S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7053-7057Google Scholar). Interestingly, mCRP is more susceptible to proteolysis than is the native CRP molecule (46Kinoshita C.M. Ying S.-C. Hugli T.E. Siegel N. Potempa L.A. Jiang H. Houghton R.A. Gewurz H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9840-9848Google Scholar). In these studies we show that mCRP, but not native CRP or peptides derived from CRP, delays neutrophil apoptosis, even in the excess of native CRP. The mCRP action was demonstrable at low microgram per ml concentrations. Consistent with the commitment of neutrophils to apoptotic death, mCRP delayed, rather than blocked, apoptosis, resulting in prolonged neu"

In most cells, caspase-11 is only expressed upon induction with pro-inflammatory stimuli. To understand how caspase-11 expression is transcriptionally regulated, we isolated the caspase-11 gene promoter by genome walking and investigated the mechanisms regulating caspase-11 gene expression in macrophages that are treated with LPS and interferon-γ. Transient transfections with caspase-11 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs and deletion/mutation analysis revealed an essential role for NF-κB binding in the up-regulation of caspase-11 in response to LPS. In the case of interferon-γ stimulation, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 binding to the caspase-11 promoter could be shown to be required for caspase-11 expression."

Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), a key enzyme involved in the transsulfuration pathway, which irreversibly converts homocysteine to cysteine, catalyzes the condensation of serine and homocysteine to cystathionine. Studies in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats have shown that CBS enzyme activity is elevated in the liver but not in the kidney, and this effect is reversed by insulin treatment. To determine whether these effects resulted from alterations at the level of gene transcription, CBS mRNA was measured in diabetic and insulin-treated diabetic rats. CBS mRNA levels were found to be markedly higher in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat livers; these were reduced by insulin administration. In H4IIE cells, a rat hepatoma cell culture model, glucocorticoids increased the cellular levels of CBS enzyme protein and CBS mRNA; insulin inhibited this stimulatory effect. Treatment with insulin also decreased CBS levels in HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line. Nuclear run-on experiments in the rat cells confirmed that stimulation of CBS gene expression by glucocorticoids and the inhibition by insulin occurred at the transcriptional level. Transient transfections of HepG2 cells with a CBS-1b promoter luciferase reporter construct showed that the promoter activity was decreased by 70% after insulin treatment. These results show that insulin has a direct role in regulating homocysteine metabolism. Altered insulin levels in diseases such as diabetes may influence homocysteine metabolism by regulating the hepatic transsulfuration pathway. Homocysteine metabolism is altered in diabetic patients.

Altered insulin levels in diseases such as diabetes may influence homocysteine metabolism by regulating the hepatic transsulfuration pathway. cystathionine β-synthase high pressure liquid chromatography phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS)1 (EC 4.2.1.22) catalyzes the first committed step in cysteine biosynthesis, the irreversible condensation of homocysteine with serine to form cystathionine (1Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9508-9513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homocysteine, a sulfur-containing nonprotein amino acid, is an intermediate in the metabolism of methionine. It is at a metabolic crossroads between its synthesis from methionine and its removal through the transsulfuration or remethylation pathways (2Finkelstein J.D Eur. J. Pediatr. 1998; 157 Suppl. 2: 40-44Crossref Google Scholar). Two pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes comprise the transsulfuration pathway: CBS, which catalyzes the condensation of serine and homocysteine to cystathionine, and cystathionine γ-lyase, which catalyzes the formation of cysteine, α-ketobutyrate, and ammonia (3Krebs H.A. Hems R. Tyler B. Biochem. J. 1986; 158: 341-353Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 4Kutzbach C. Stokstad E.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 250: 459-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The regulation of CBS gene expression is important in a number of physiological situations. Feeding rats a high protein diet or a high methionine diet increases CBS activity (5Yamamoto N. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 1995; 41: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is also known that flux through the transsulfuration pathway provides cysteine for glutathione synthesis, so that altered CBS levels may be of importance in oxidative stress (6Taoka S. Ohja S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The well known sparing effect of cysteine on methionine requirements is mediated, at least in part, via alterations in CBS activity. Our own recent work shows that glucagon administration to rats increases hepatic CBS enzyme activity and mRNA levels (7Jacobs R.L. Stead L.M. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43740-43747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). CBS enzyme deficiency, an autosomal recessively inherited disorder, is the leading cause of homocystinuria. Partial deficiency may lead to hyperhomocysteinemia, causing premature peripheral and cerebral occlusive arterial disease (8Brattstrom L. Israelsson B. Lindgarde F. Hultberg B. Metabolism. 1988; 37: 175-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Boers G.H. Smals A.G. Trijbels F.J. Fowler B. Bakkeren J.A. Schoonderwaldt H.C. Kleijer W.J. Kloppenborg P.W.

Elevation of plasma homocysteine levels is recognized as an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. The plasma concentration of homocysteine is known to be perturbed in diabetes, being increased when renal insufficiency is evident (10Hultberg B. Agardh E. Andersson A. Brattstrom L. Isaksson A.

Freychet P. Diabetes Metab. 1994; 20: 494-496PubMed Google Scholar). However, patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with no clinical signs of renal insufficiency, have lower than normal levels of homocysteine (14Bostom A. Brosnan J.T. Hall B. Nadeau M.R. Selhub J. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 116: 59-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Our previous work has shown that the plasma homocysteine level was also decreased in the streptozotocin-induced rat diabetic model with a concomitant increase in hepatic CBS enzyme activity; insulin administration reversed these effects (15Jacobs R.L. House J.D. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1967-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is characterized not only by insufficient circulating levels of insulin but also by elevated levels of counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon and glucocorticoids (15Jacobs R.L. House J.D. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1967-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 16Wilson D.E. Ann. Intern.

Moreover, cyclic AMP- elevating agents and glucocorticoids have been shown to increase the level of CBS enzyme activity in rat hepatoma cells (18Goss S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 82: 309-320Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the increase in the hepatic CBS activity in diabetic rat liver may be brought about by decreased insulin and/or by increased levels of counterregulatory hormones. The aim of this study was to examine the role of insulin and counterregulatory hormones on the expression of the CBS gene, using a diabetic rat liver model as well as rat and human hepatoma cell lines. All procedures were approved by Memorial University's Institutional Animal Care Committee and were in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250–350 g were fed laboratory chowad libitum and had free access to water. Diabetes was induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (100 mg/kg body weight; freshly dissolved in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 4.5)) through the tail vein, under light ether anesthesia; an equal volume of citrate buffer was administered to control rats. The streptozotocin-diabetic rats were treated subcutaneously with insulin (Novolin Ultralente human insulin; Lilly) for 5 days to allow the animals to recover from any nonspecific effects of streptozotocin. Thereafter, insulin was withdrawn, and the rats received saline injections for up to 5 days. At this point, insulin was readministered to untreated-diabetic rats for up to 5 days. Control rats received saline throughout the experiment. The insulin dose (∼40 units/day) was adjusted to maintain blood glucose close to normal values as measured with an Ames Glucometer II, using a drop of blood obtained by tail prick. On the day of the study, animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg). Blood samples were taken from the abdominal aorta into heparinized tubes and placed on ice for a few minutes until they were centrifuged at 2700 × g for 15 min for plasma separation. The liver was rapidly removed, freeze-clamped in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until used. Rat hepatoma H4IIE cells and human hepatoma HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The CBS-negative a23 Chinese hamster Don fibroblast cell line has been described previously (19Skovby F. Krassikoff N. Francke U. Hum. Genet. 1984; 65: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). H4IIE cells were grown in 75-cm2 culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Canadian Life Technologies, Burlington, Canada). HepG2 cells and a23 Chinese hamster Don fibroblast cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were grown to 70–75% confluence under 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. H4IIE cells were made quiescent by overnight culture in medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Before the addition of hormones, cells were provided with fresh medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 1 h. The medium was changed once more before stimulating with triamcinolone and/or insulin (Sigma). At the end of the incubation, media were aspirated, and cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell viability was monitored by trypan blue exclusion (20Freshney R.I. Culture of Animal Cells. 4th Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar). CBS enzyme activity in rat liver and in H4IIE cells was assayed using the method described by Milleret al. (21Miller J.W. Nadeau M.R. Smith J. Smith D. Selhub J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.95 mm S-adenosylmethionine, a positive allosteric regulator of the enzyme. The production of cystathionine was measured by HPLC (22Jones B.N. Gilligan J.P. J. Chromatogr. 1983; 266: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Homocysteine concentrations were determined using HPLC by the method of Vester and Rassmussen (23Vester B. Rasmussen K. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1991; 29: 549-554PubMed Google Scholar). This method measures total plasma homocysteine (both free and protein-bound forms). Plasma glucose was determined enzymatically (24Bergmeyer H.U. Bernt E. Schmidt F. Stork H. Bergmeyer H.U. 2nd Ed.

Protein concentration in the liver samples was determined by the Biuret method and by the method of Lowry (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

CBS enzyme activity in HepG2 cells was measured according to the method described by Kraus (26Kraus J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 388-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). H4IIE cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue), scraped off the plate, and sonicated for 10–15 s to shear DNA and reduce viscosity. Protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (27Smith, P. K., Krohn, R. I., Hermanson, G. T., Mallia, A. K., Gartner, F. H., Provenzano, M. D., Fujimoto, E.

The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (blocking buffer), incubated with anti-CBS (rat) polyclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution in blocking buffer), washed, and incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2000 dilution in blocking buffer). The membranes were then washed and detected by exposing the membranes to Kodak Biomax ML film, employing a chemiluminescent detection system (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Protein bands were quantitated by using ChemiImager™ 4000 (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). HepG2 cell lysate samples were electrophoresed on a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a semidry blotting technique. CBS-negative a23 Chinese Hamster Don fibroblast cell lysate was used as a negative control. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20. CBS was detected using specific anti-CBS antibody (1:2000 dilution in 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0), washed, and incubated with secondary anti-rabbit IgG, conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The second antibody was diluted to 1:30,000 in 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, and 0.2% Tween 20. The signal was visualized using the ECL Western blot system (Amersham Biosciences) and fluorography with X-Omat film. Total RNA was isolated by a rapid guanidinium isothiocyanate method as previously described (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Chem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). RNA was denatured in formamide (50%), formaldehyde (6.5%) sample buffer at 65 °C for 15 min; separated on formaldehyde (1.8%), agarose (0.8%); and transferred to nylon (S & S Nytran) membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). RNA was fixed by UV cross-linking. The membranes were prehybridized and then hybridized with a cDNA probe specific for rat CBS (2.3-kb EcoRI fragment of rat CBS cDNA (29Swaroop M. Bradley K. Ohura T.

The membranes were stripped and hybridized with a random primer radiolabeled β-actin cDNA probe (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) to control for equal loading of RNA and washed at high stringency (final wash, 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS at 53 °C). Autoradiography was carried out by exposure of the blot to Kodak XAR or Biomax film. Autoradiographs were scanned on ChemiImager™ 4000, and RNA levels were quantitated with Alpha Ease software (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). Total RNA was isolated from H4IIE cells after treatment with hormones as described. 2 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using a one-step reverse transcription kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada) and amplified by 30 cycles. An upstream primer (5′-GCCTTCAGGACATCCAGTGT-3′) and a downstream primer (5′-TCTTTCCGGGTCTGCTCACGGGC-3′) corresponding to the coding sequence of type 3 rat CBS cDNA (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Chem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) were used to amplify a 1644-bp PCR fragment. A 768-bp fragment of the rat β-actin was co-amplified using amplimer set primers (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). PCR products were separated on 0.8% agarose. Ethidium bromide-stained bands were visualized by UV illumination. The gel was immersed in 0.25 m HCl for 30 min, denatured in denaturing buffer (1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m NaOH) for 30 min, rinsed with distilled water, soaked in neutralization buffer (0.5m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1.5 m NaCl) with gentle agitation, incubated in 10× SSC, and transferred to S and S Nytran SuPer charge® nylon membrane. After transfer, the DNA was immobilized by UV cross-linking in a Hoefer UVC 500 UV cross-linker (AmershamBiosciences). The blots were simultaneously probed with32P-labeled CBS cDNA and radiolabeled β-actin cDNA probe (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). Autoradiography was carried out using Kodak XAR or Biomax film. The sequence and construction of the CBS-1b promoter luciferase reporter construct pCBS47 have been described previously (30Kraus J.P. Oliveriusova J. Sokolova J. Kraus E. Vlcek C. de Franchis R. Maclean K.N. Bao L. Bukovsk G. Patterson D. Paces V. Ansorge W. Kozich V. Genomics. 1998; 52: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The control luciferase reporter constructs pGL-Control (positive control), pGL3-basic (negative control containing no promoter), and pRL-CMV (internal transfection control) were all obtained from Promega. Cellular transfection was performed using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol for attached cells and typically used 0.5 μg of the test construct and 50 ng of the internal pRL-CMV per well in a 24-well tissue culture plate. After transfection, cells were harvested in situusing direct cell lysis buffer (Promega) and were subsequently assayed for both Renilla and firefly luciferase activities using a dual luciferase system (Promega) and a Moonlight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All promoter assay values were corrected for transfection efficiency by normalizing the firefly luciferase signal of the CBS-1b promoter construct to the Renilla luciferase values derived from the co-transfected, control vector pRL-CMV. All values are expressed as ratios of the test to the internal control reporter expression. Unless otherwise stated, the results shown are the average of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate, with the error bars representing S.E. Nuclear run-on assays were performed according to a previously described method (31Greenberg M.E. Barden T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 4.10Google Scholar). H4IIE cells were grown in 150-cm2 flasks, and, for each assay, nuclei were isolated from 5 × 107 cells. Nuclear suspensions (200 μl) were incubated with 2.5 mm each of CTP, ATP, and GTP and with 200 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The 32P-labeled RNA was isolated, after deoxyribonuclease I and proteinase K treatments, by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation; it was further purified by Micro Biospin 30 (Bio-Rad) chromatography. Equal amounts (107 cpm/ml) of labeled nuclear RNA were hybridized at 42 °C for 72 h to Nytran membranes previously bound with 5 μg of linearized plasmid DNAs. The immobilized plasmids used were CBS-pBluescript containing a 2.4-kb cDNA for rat liver CBS, β-actin-pBluescript (American Tissue Culture Collection), and pBluescript vector (for background control). After washing, the filters were subjected to autoradiography. Radioactive transcripts were quantified by densitometry. Data were normalized to transcription of the β-actin gene. Table I gives data on plasma homocysteine and glucose levels in diabetic rats. Plasma glucose levels were markedly higher in streptozotocin-injected rats, indicating profound diabetes. This returned to normal levels on insulin treatment. The animals were also ketotic. Mean blood pH in diabetic rats was 7.18 ± 0.12, and the sum of β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate was 5.5 ± 0.8 mm. This ketosis was corrected by insulin treatment. Table I shows that plasma homocysteine level in the diabetic rats was only about 40% of that found in control rats. Treatment of diabetic rats with insulin increased plasma homocysteine levels within 1 day of treatment but did not return them to the control level even after 5 days of treatment. To examine whether the lowering of homocysteine levels in the untreated diabetic rat could be attributed to an increase in CBS enzyme activity and, by extension, an increase in homocysteine catabolism through the transsulfuration pathway, we measured the activity of this enzyme in livers from control, diabetic, and insulin-treated diabetic rats. CBS activity was elevated in the diabetic rats; this was returned to control values by insulin treatment (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether this observed decrease in CBS enzyme activity is regulated at the level of transcription, we measured CBS mRNA in treated and untreated diabetic rat livers. CBS mRNA levels were higher in diabetic rat livers compared with control rat livers, and this was reversed by insulin treatment (Fig. 1 B). When normalized for β-actin mRNA, the level of CBS mRNA was doubled in diabetic rat liver. Insulin treatment decreased the level of CBS mRNA to control values within a day (Fig. 1 C).Table IEffect of diabetes and insulin treatment on plasma homocysteine and plasma glucose in ratsRatsPlasma homocysteinePlasma glucoseμmmmControl8.8 ± 1.7***7.6 ± 1.6*Diabetic3.2 ± 0.5*32.2 ± 5.6**Diabetic + 1 day insulin5.5 ± 0.8**9.3 ± 3.5*Diabetic + 3 days insulin5.9 ± 0.7**5.5 ± 1.4*Diabetic + 5 days insulin6.1 ± 2.2**5.9 ± 0.8*Values are expressed as mean ± S.D.

Values with differing numbers of asterisks within each column are significantly different, p < 0.05. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is marked not only by a decrease in insulin levels but also by an increase in the circulating levels of the so-called counterregulatory hormones, glucocorticoids and glucagon (16Wilson D.E. Ann. Intern. Med. 1983; 98: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1976; 25: 136-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate whether insulin and its counter-regulatory hormones exert a direct and specific effect on liver cells, we used hepatoma cell lines. The basal CBS enzyme activity is low in H4IIE cells (rat hepatoma). However, CBS activity was elevated in these cells when stimulated with glucocorticoids. Specifically, the CBS activity in H4IIE cells, stimulated with the glucocorticoid analogue triamcinolone, exhibited an ∼1.5-fold increase in CBS enzyme activity, which fell to normal levels when subjected to insulin treatment (Fig. 2 A). To examine whether this increase in enzyme activity in response to triamcinolone was due to an increased quantity of CBS protein, total cell lysate proteins were analyzed by Western blot. A significant increase in the level of CBS protein was evident in triamcinolone-stimulated H4IIE cells, and this was dependent on the concentration of triamcinolone. Fig. 2 B shows the increase in CBS enzyme protein expression in response to increasing concentrations of triamcinolone. The 63-kDa CBS protein was evident in cells stimulated with 50 nm of triamcinolone, increased in a dose-dependent manner, and reached a maximum at a triamcinolone concentration of 1 μm. H4IIE cells were therefore stimulated by a fixed concentration of triamcinolone (100 nm) in the presence of various doses of insulin (10 nm to 1 μm). Fig. 2 C shows that this glucocorticoid-mediated CBS expression was markedly inhibited by insulin at a concentration of 10 nm, and complete inhibition of CBS expression was seen at a concentration of 1 μm. To examine the effects of triamcinolone and insulin on CBS gene expression, total RNA was isolated from hormone-treated and control H4IIE cells. Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed and amplified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Ethidium bromide staining showed the expected 1642-bp CBS and 764-bp β-actin. Control cells expressed only low levels of CBS mRNA. To confirm that the products seen on ethidium bromide-stained gels were indeed CBS and β-actin, agarose gels were Southern blotted and probed with 32P random primer labeled CBS cDNA and β-actin cDNA (Fig.3 A). Southern blotting and densitometric analysis clearly showed that there was a 3–4-fold increase in CBS mRNA levels when H4IIE cells were stimulated with triamcinolone (1 μm) for 18 h. This stimulation of mRNA expression by glucocorticoids was completely inhibited by insulin (1 μm). Stimulation of these cells by CPT cAMP (200 μm) resulted in a modest increase in CBS mRNA (by about 75%). However, no additive effect was seen when cells were stimulated by a combination of triamcinolone and cAMP (Fig.3 B). Stimulation by glucagon showed no effect on CBS mRNA expression. Our results show that triamcinolone and insulin exert opposing effects on CBS enzyme activity, protein concentration and mRNA levels in H4IIE cells. Glucocorticoids are known to function primarily by changing the rate of transcription of target genes (32Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2852) Google Scholar). To determine whether glucocorticoids and insulin exerted direct control over the transcription of the CBS gene, nuclear run-on assays were performed on isolated nuclei from H4IIE cells that had been incubated with 1 μm triamcinolone in the presence and absence of insulin for 6 h. Labeled transcripts show that the relative transcription rates were increased in cells that had been stimulated with triamcinolone. When normalized to the β-actin transcription rate, there was an approximately 2.5-fold increase in the CBS transcription rate after triamcinolone stimulation. Insulin treatment reversed this increase, suggesting that the effect of both hormones is mainly exerted at the level of transcription (Fig.4, A and B).Figure 4Effect of hormones on CBS transcription rate in H4IIE cells. Nuclei from control, triamcinolone, and triamcinolone plus insulin-treated cells were isolated and used for run-on transcription assays. Autoradiograms of labeled transcripts representing CBS, β-actin, and pBluescript are shown. B, relative transcription rate when normalized to β-actin. Data presented are the average derived from two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next asked whether the effects of hormones on CBS enzyme activity and expression seen in rodent cells could be demonstrated in a human cell model. There was a strong basal expression of CBS in nonconfluent HepG2 cells. When these cells were subjected to insulin treatment, CBS enzyme activity was decreased by about 70%. Treatment with the counterregulatory hormone, glucagon, had no effect on CBS enzyme activity in these cells (Fig.5 A). These results were very similar to those obtained from the rat model. Western blotting analysis showed that this decrease in CBS activity is accompanied by decreased levels of CBS protein in insulin-treated cells compared with control. There was no change in the level of CBS protein in glucagon-treated cells (Fig. 5 B). To examine whether insulin exerted its effect by controlling the promoter elements that mediate CBS gene transcription, HepG2 cells were transfected with the CBS-1b promoter reporter construct pCBS47 fused to a luciferase reporter gene (30Kraus J.P. Oliveriusova J. Sokolova J. Kraus E. Vlcek C. de Franchis R. Maclean K.N. Bao L. Bukovsk G. Patterson D. Paces V. Ansorge W. Kozich V. Genomics. 1998; 52: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Treatment of the transfected cells with 0.1 μm insulin for 48 h resulted in a marked decrease in luciferase activity (Fig. 5 C), showing that the decreased CBS activity brought about by insulin is mediated through insulin-sensitive sequence(s) on the CBS gene regulatory region. Stimulation by glucagon treatment had no effect on C"

https://openalex.org/W2132803022,"Tom7 is a component of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) and assembles into a general import pore complex that translocates preproteins into mitochondria. We have identified the human Tom7 homolog and characterized its import and assembly into the mammalian TOM complex. Tom7 is imported into mitochondria in a nucleotide-independent manner and is anchored to the outer membrane with its C terminus facing the intermembrane space. Unlike studies in fungi, we found that human Tom7 assembles into an ∼120-kDa import intermediate in HeLa cell mitochondria. To detect subunits within this complex, we employed a novel supershift analysis whereby mitochondria containing newly imported Tom7 were incubated with antibodies specific for individual TOM components prior to separation by blue native electrophoresis. We found that the 120-kDa complex contains Tom40 and lacks receptor components. This intermediate can be chased to the stable ∼380-kDa mammalian TOM complex that additionally contains Tom22. Overexpression of Tom22 in HeLa cells results in the rapid assembly of Tom7 into the 380-kDa complex indicating that Tom22 is rate-limiting for TOM complex formation. These results indicate that the levels of Tom22 within mitochondria dictate the assembly of TOM complexes and hence may regulate its biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2117903988,"Insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes are characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia and are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis. In an effort to understand how this occurs, we have investigated whether these factors cause disregulation of cholesterol ester metabolism in J774.2 macrophages. Raising glucose levels alone was sufficient to increase uptake of acetylated low density lipoprotein but did not stimulate synthesis of cholesterol esters. In the presence of high glucose, both insulin and leptin increased the rate of cholesterol ester synthesis, although they did not further increase uptake of acetylated low density lipoprotein. However, in the presence of high glucose both insulin and leptin caused a significant increase in the activity of acyl-CoA: cholesterol O-acyltransferase (ACAT) combined with a significant reduction in the level of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Because ACAT is the main enzyme responsible for cholesterol ester synthesis and HSL contributes significantly to neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activity, this suggests that glucose primes the J774.2 cells so that in the presence of high insulin or leptin they will store cholesterol esters. This contrasts with 3T3-L1 adipocytes, where HSL activity and expression are increased by insulin in high glucose conditions. These findings may provide an explanation for the observation that in conditions characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperleptinemia, and hyperinsulinemia, triglyceride lipolysis in adipocytes is increased while hydrolysis of cholesterol esters in macrophages is decreased, contributing to foam cell formation.

Insulin resistance, type-2 diabetes, and obesity are characterized by hyperleptinemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia, suggesting these may be acting as proatherogenic factors (6Considine R.V.

Diabetes. 1988; 37: 667-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, there is good evidence that a range of growth factors and cytokines can act to promote atherogenesis (9Raines E.W. Ross R. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the importance of glucose levels is shown by the fact that there is a very strong positive correlation between glycated hemoglobin levels and mortality from cardiovascular disease, even in non-diabetic subjects (10Khaw K. Wareham N. Luben R. Bingham S. Oakes S. Welch A. Day N. Br. Med. J. 2001; 322: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased rate of atherogenesis in these groups is poorly understood, and little is known about the specific roles of leptin, insulin, and glucose in this process. The first lesion of atherosclerosis (fatty streak or type-1 lesion) is characterized by an accumulation in the intima of the vascular epithelia of lipid-laden macrophage foam cells (11Stary H.C. Chandler A.B. Glagov S. Guyton J.R. Insull W. Rosenfeld M.E. Schaffer S.A. Schwartz C.J. Wagner W.D. Wissler R.W. Circulation. 1994; 89: 2462-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 12Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18955) Google Scholar). Cholesterol cannot efflux from the cell when esterified, but the bulk (∼75%) of the lipid in foam cells is in the form of cholesteryl esters (CEs)1 (11Stary H.C. Chandler A.B. Glagov S. Guyton J.R. Insull W. Rosenfeld M.E. Schaffer S.A. Schwartz C.J. Wagner W.D. Wissler R.W. Circulation. 1994; 89: 2462-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 12Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18955) Google Scholar). Regulation of cellular CE levels is complex, but a cycle exists between free cholesterol and esterified cholesterol in the cell; the balance of this cycle is a major determinant of the level of the intracellular pool of CE in foam cells. In this cycle, CE synthesis is controlled by acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferases (ACATs), a family of intracellular enzymes responsible for catalyzing the intracellular formation of cholesteryl esters from cholesterol and long-chain fatty acyl coenzyme A (13Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 14Tabas I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To maintain low levels of free cholesterol within the cell, ACAT activity is up-regulated by LDL and exogenous free cholesterol (15Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4288) Google Scholar). The expression and activity of ACAT is increased in human monocytes during differentiation and foam cell formation (16Wang H.X. Germain S.J. Benfield P.P. Gillies P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and ACAT has been shown to play a crucial role in the accumulation of CE in foam cells (14Tabas I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, there have been no studies of the regulation of ACAT in macrophages by insulin, leptin, and glucose. The breakdown of CE to produce free cholesterol in macrophages is controlled by the neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (nCEH) (17Yeaman S.J. Smith G.M. Jepson C.A. Wood S.L. Emmison N. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1994; 34: 355-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Brown M.S., Ho, Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9344-9352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is now strong evidence that hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), the rate-limiting enzyme of triglyceride lipolysis in adipocytes, is the enzyme contributing the major part of nCEH activity in macrophage cell culture models such as the J774.2 cells (17Yeaman S.J. Smith G.M. Jepson C.A. Wood S.L. Emmison N. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1994; 34: 355-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Escary J. Choy H.A. Reue K. Schotz M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The exact contribution of HSL to nCEH activity in macrophages in vivois less clear, because although HSL is clearly detected in murine macrophages, deletion of the HSL gene caused little difference in nCEH activity in peritoneal macrophages (20Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for this is that there is a compensatory increase in other cholesterol esterases in macrophages in these animals. However, the importance of HSL as a nCEH is shown by the observation that nCEH activity is ablated in a wide range of tissues in the HSL knockout mice (20Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Further, the same group has recently demonstrated cholesterol esters can be eliminated from macrophage foam cells by overexpressing HSL (21Okazaki H. Osuga J.I. Tsukamoto K. Isoo N. Kitamine T. Tamura Y. Tomita S. Sekiya M. Yahagi N. Iizuka Y. Okhashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Shimano H. Kimura S. Nagai R. Yamada N. Ishibashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31893-31899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Together, the evidence indicates that regulation of HSL is likely to play an important role in determining CE levels in cells, and it is therefore important to understand the mechanisms affecting the activity of this enzyme. The effects of glucose, insulin, and leptin on the mechanisms regulating CE metabolism in macrophages have not been well studied. Indeed there are no reports of effects of these factors on LDL uptake or ACAT activity in macrophages, although the recent finding that increasing glucose concentrations cause an increase in the expression of the CD36 scavenger receptor indicates that hyperglycemia might have a direct role in stimulating LDL uptake (22Griffin E., Re, A. Hamel N., Fu., C. Bush H. McAffrey T. Asch A.S. Nature Medicine. 2001; 7: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, we have recently reported that insulin and leptin acutely stimulate HSL activity in J774.2 macrophages (23O'Rourke L. Yeaman S.J. Shepherd P.R. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 955-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), suggesting they may have a regulatory role in CE metabolism in these cells. Recent data also suggest chronic exposure of cells to glucose and insulin is also likely to have effects on HSL gene expression because insulin and glucose regulate lipolysis and HSL expression in adipocytes (24Botion L.M. Green A. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Smih F. Rouet P. Lucas S. Mairal A. Sengenes C. Lafontan M. Vaulont S. Casado M. Langin D.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2225-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore we have investigated whether glucose levels, in combination with high levels of insulin or leptin, might effect CE synthesis in macrophages and whether there are detectable effects on cholesterol uptake, ACAT activity, or HSL activity in these cells. 125I-Protein A, cholesterol [1-14C]oleate, [1-14C]oleic acid and [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA were obtained from AmershamBiosciences.

Experiments were performed on confluent J774.2 cells. After stimulation with leptin (10 nm) or insulin (1 μm) in 5 or 20 mm glucose, the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS (calcium- and magnesium-free) and lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris base (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanodate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 200 kallikrein-inactivating units of aprotinin. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C with HSL antibody for 2 h before incubation with protein A-agarose (HSL) for a further hour. For Western blotting, samples were subject to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride and immunoblotted with appropriate primary antibodies and bands visualized with 125I-protein A using a Fuji FLA2000 PhosphoImager. Bands were quantitated using the Fuji ImageQuant software. For acetylated LDL uptake experiments, cells were incubated in RPMI containing either 5 or 20 mmglucose, with or without the addition of 1 μm insulin or 10 nm leptin, for 24 h at 37 °C. For the last 4 h of the incubation, 10 μg/ml fluorescent DiI-labeled acLDL was added. Cells were washed three times in PBS before fluorescence was measured using a Fuji FLA 2000 fluorescent image analyzer. To measure nCEH activity in J774.2 lysates, cell monolayers were washed with PBS before being scraped into 200 μl of assay buffer (5 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 30% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 200 kallikrein-inactivating units of aprotinin). Cells were lysed with 4 rounds of freeze-thawing followed by centrifugation at 14000 rpm at 4 °C. Activity was assayed as described previously (28Khoo J.C. Steinberg D. Huang J.J. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2882-2890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure nCEH activity in anti-HSL immunoprecipitates, 50 μl of assay buffer was added to the beads, and activity was assayed. [14C]Oleic acid released from labeled cholesterol[14C]oleate was quantitated by scintillation counting. One unit of enzyme activity catalyzes the release of 1 μmol of oleate per minute. We found that activity in HSL immunoprecipitates correlates very well with activity in total cell lysates under all conditions investigated (data not shown). The ACAT assay was performed according to the method of Mazière et al. (29Mazière C. Mazière J.C. Mora L. Polonovski J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1987; 14: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Mazière C. Barbu V. Auclair M. Mazière J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, following serum starvation and treatment with insulin (1 μm) or leptin (10 nm) for 24 h in low or high glucose RPMI, J774.2 cells were washed twice in PBS and scraped into 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, followed by homogenization using a micropestle. The ACAT assay mixture contained 150 μg of protein, 0.1 μCi of [14C]oleoyl-CoA diluted with 0.1 mmunlabelled oleoyl-CoA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 80 μl. Incubations were performed for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped on ice. Radioactive cholesteryl esters were separated by thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates developed in hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:2) and analyzed using a Fuji FLA2000 PhosphoImager. Spots were quantitated using the Fuji ImageQuant software. [14C]choesteryl oleate was used as standard. Human lipoproteins were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation in a vertical rotor, as previously described (31Chung B.H. Segrest J.P. Ray M.J. Brunzele J.D. Hokansen J.E. Krauss R.M. Beaudree J.D. Cone J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 181-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). LDL was acetylated by the addition of saturated sodium acetate solution followed by acetic anhydride (32Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Prior to loading, cells were serum starved overnight. Cells were washed twice in PBS before the addition of RPMI containing either 5 or 20 mm glucose and either 1 μm insulin or 10 nm leptin, 100 μg/ml acetylated LDL, and 1 μCi/ml [14C]oleate–0.12% bovine serum albumin and incubation for 24 h. Cells were washed twice in PBS and harvested into 0.5 ml of PBS. 0.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) was added followed by vortexing for 10 s before centrifugation at 1800 ×g for 10 min at 10 °C. The lower organic phase was transferred to a glass vial, and the upper phase was washed with chloroform/methanol as before. Again the lower organic phase was transferred to the glass vial. Chloroform was removed by drying under nitrogen. Lipids were resuspended in isopropanol and separated by thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates developed in hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v/v). Radioactive bands were detected and quantitated using a Fuji FLA2000 PhosphoImager, and bands were quantitated using the Fuji ImageQuant software. Recovery efficiencies were determined using tritiated standards and were 89.4% for cholesterol ester, 93.4% for cholesterol, and 87.8% for triacylglycerol. We investigated the effects of leptin, insulin, and glucose on CE metabolism in macrophages. J774.2 macrophages were incubated with acetylated LDL and [14C]oleate, and the amount of label incorporated into CEs was determined following a 24-h incubation with insulin or leptin. These experiments were performed at both 5 and 20 mm glucose to determine whether glycemia affected CE formation. We find that increasing glucose levels in the media did not alter the formation of CE over the 24-h period (Fig.1). Further, in 5 mm glucose insulin does not affect CE formation in the macrophages, although in 20 mm glucose insulin does cause a clear increase in CE formation (Fig. 1 A). Similar observations are made in the case of leptin where 24 h of treatment of the macrophages with leptin in 5 mm glucose does not increase CE formation. In contrast, formation of CE is significantly increased in leptin-treated cells incubated at 20 mm glucose. The amount of CE in leptin-stimulated cells in 20 mm glucose is 60% greater than the level of formation seen in leptin-treated cells incubated in 5 mm glucose (Fig. 1 B). This indicates the increase in glucose levels acts to potentiate the effects of leptin and insulin on CE formation. To determine whether this change in the CE content of macrophages is due to increased uptake of modified LDL, DiI-labeled acLDL was used to measure uptake under the same conditions (Fig. 2). Incubation of macrophages in high glucose media results in more acLDL uptake compared with low glucose media, but there was no significant stimulation by insulin or leptin, suggesting the effect on the rate of CE synthesis described above required control of the enzymes that regulate cholesterol ester synthesis and degradation. We then investigated the effects of leptin, insulin, and glucose on ACAT activity to determine whether the increase in CE synthesis would correlate with an increase in ACAT activity. ACAT activity was determined by measuring [14C]oleoyl-CoA incorporation into CE. To verify that this represented true ACAT activity, assays were performed in the presence of 100 nm 447C88, a known ACAT inhibitor, and this was found to completely abolish activity (data not shown). As expected, ACAT activity was induced in J774.2 cells incubated for 24 h with acLDL both at low and high glucose levels (data not shown). To test the effects of glucose, leptin, and insulin, J774.2 macrophages were incubated for 24 h with insulin (1 μm) or leptin (10 nm) at 5 or 20 mm glucose. At 5 mmglucose, insulin increased ACAT activity ∼6-fold, whereas leptin did not affect ACAT activity (Fig. 3). Increasing glucose levels alone did not significantly affect ACAT activity, but both insulin and leptin significantly induced ACAT activity at 20 mm glucose (∼9-fold compared with basal levels at low glucose) (Fig. 3). We also investigated effects on neutral cholesterol esterase activity, focusing on nCEH activity associated with HSL because there is strong evidence that HSL acts as an nCEH in macrophages (19Escary J. Choy H.A. Reue K. Schotz M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Jepson C.A. Harrison J.A. Kraemer F.B. Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In J774.2 macrophages, HSL also accounts for a large percentage of the cellular neutral cholesterol esterase activity, as demonstrated by the fact that immunodepletion of HSL reduces nCEH activity in cell lysates by over 50% while reducing HSL protein levels by a similar amount (Fig.4). This indicates that changes in HSL expression or activity could contribute to alterations in the levels of CE in these cells. To test whether this was the case, J774.2 macrophages were exposed to insulin or leptin in the presence of 5 or 20 mm glucose for up to 24 h, and HSL activity and expression were determined. Changes in glucose alone had no effect on HSL activity (data not shown). Insulin treatment caused a small increase in HSL activity in cells maintained in 5 mm glucose (Fig.5 A), but in macrophages maintained in high glucose media insulin caused a significant decrease in HSL activity (Fig. 5 A). We also investigated the effect of leptin on HSL activity in macrophages. Stimulation with 10 nm leptin for 24 h resulted in a significant increase (40–50%) in HSL activity (Fig. 5 B) in macrophages in media containing 5 mm glucose. However, similar to our results with insulin, in J774.2 cells maintained in high glucose leptin causes a significant reduction in HSL activity (Fig.5 B) of ∼30% compared with the activity seen in high glucose.Figure 5Chronic effect of insulin, leptin, and glucose on nCEH activity associated with HSL in macrophages.J774.2 macrophages were incubated in media containing 1 μm insulin (A) or 10 nm leptin (B), 2% fetal calf serum, and either 5 (shaded bars) or 20 mm (black bars) glucose. HSL was immunoprecipitated, and neutral cholesterol esterase activity was determined. Data represents the mean ± S.E. of five independent determinations, each performed at least in duplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's paired t test. * and ** indicate differences of p <0.05 and p <0.01, respectively, compared with basal in the same glucose concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next performed Western blotting experiments to determine whether the changes in HSL activity correlate with changes in the level of HSL protein in cells. Changes in glucose levels alone did not affect HSL protein levels (Fig. 6 A). The effects of insulin on HSL expression in macrophages broadly followed the effects on HSL activity, with insulin having very little effect in low glucose media but causing a significant decrease in HSL expression in high glucose media (Fig. 6 B). Leptin treatment also changed HSL expression in the same way it changes HSL activity, reducing HSL expression in hyperglycemic conditions and increasing protein levels in normoglycemic conditions (Fig. 6 C). HSL activity has been most extensively studied in adipocytes, where it has been reported that insulin and high glucose increase triglyceride lipolysis (24Botion L.M. Green A. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and HSL expression (25Smih F. Rouet P. Lucas S. Mairal A. Sengenes C. Lafontan M. Vaulont S. Casado M. Langin D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This would suggest that, unlike macrophages, HSL activity and/or expression is increased under these conditions in adipocytes. Therefore we investigated the effect of insulin and high glucose on HSL expression and activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As predicted, insulin caused a sustained increase in HSL activity and expression in high glucose, and no effect was seen in low glucose (Fig. 7). The results of the current study demonstrate that under normoglycemic conditions neither insulin nor leptin promote cholesterol ester deposition in macrophages. However, we identify a novel mechanism by which increases in glucose levels become permissive for insulin and leptin to stimulate cholesterol ester synthesis. Such a mechanism has important implications because atherosclerotic heart disease is closely associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and type-II diabetes in humans and atherosclerosis is often evident before diabetes is diagnosed (1DeFronzo R.A. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1991; 14: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (4122) Google Scholar, 2Yip J. Facchini F.S. Reaven G.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

We have identified glucose-dependent effects on three of the major processes regulating cholesterol metabolism that are all likely to contribute to the increased rate of cholesterol ester accumulation. The first of these is increased uptake of modified LDL stimulated by high glucose. Two mechanisms have previously been identified by which glucose could increase acLDL uptake. In the first it has recently been shown (22Griffin E., Re, A. Hamel N., Fu., C. Bush H. McAffrey T. Asch A.S. Nature Medicine. 2001; 7: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) that glucose increases expression of the CD36 scavenger receptor. A second explanation may lie in the observation that CD36 can act as a receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) (35Ohgami N. Nagai R. Ikemoto M. Arai H. Kuniyasu A. Horiuch S. Nakayama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3195-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Incubation media containing 20 mm glucose would be expected to create more AGE than media containing 5 mm glucose, and therefore increased uptake into the cell by both CD36 and the scavenger receptor class A types I and II is likely. However, the increase in acLDL uptake induced by glucose alone does not correlate with an increase in cholesterol ester accumulation, so the increased uptake of acLDL alone is not sufficient to increase the rate of cholesterol ester accumulation. The second possible mechanism investigated involves changes in ACAT activity. Surprisingly, we find that insulin and leptin both stimulate ACAT activity. Insulin stimulates ACAT activity 5–6-fold in low glucose and causes a similar level of activation at high glucose, whereas the leptin effect is only 2-fold in low glucose but is similar to that of insulin in high glucose. We believe that the increased ACAT activity is likely because of increased ACAT expression, given the fact that this effect is observed after 24 h. Any such changes are likely to be in the ACAT1 form because this is most highly expressed in macrophages (16Wang H.X. Germain S.J. Benfield P.P. Gillies P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Uelmen P.J. Oka K. Sullivan M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26192-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and at least in liver this form is regulated by cholesterol levels (36Uelmen P.J. Oka K. Sullivan M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26192-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To date, the lack of suitable antibodies has prevented us from determining whether this is indeed the case in our system. However, our evidence indicates that the increase in ACAT activity, although likely to facilitate increased CE synthesis, is itself probably not sufficient to stimulate CE synthesis. This is shown by the finding that glucose alone increases acLDL uptake, which also stimulates ACAT activity and yet is not associated with an increase in CE synthesis under these conditions. The third mechanism that could be contributing to cholesterol ester deposition is the rate of cholesterol ester breakdown via nCEH; we find HSL is a major nCEH in the J774.2 cells. We have previously shown (23O'Rourke L. Yeaman S.J. Shepherd P.R. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 955-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) that following acute exposure leptin causes an increase, whereas insulin causes a decrease, in HSL activity in J774.2 macrophages in media containing 10 mm glucose. However, the previous study did not investigate the chronic regulation of HSL in macrophages by insulin, leptin, and glucose, the factors that characterize the obese and insulin-resistant states. There is evidence that the combination of insulin and glucose are important in chronically regulating HSL in other cell types. HSL activity is up-regulated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and pancreatic β-cells exposed to high glucose levels (25Smih F. Rouet P. Lucas S. Mairal A. Sengenes C. Lafontan M. Vaulont S. Casado M. Langin D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Winzell M.S. Svensson H. Arner P. Ahren B. Holm C. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2225-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas chronic exposure to insulin has previously been reported to increase HSL expression levels in adipocytes (37Kang E.S. Betts D. Fain J.N. Bahouth S.W. Myers L.K. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and to increase lipolysis in a glucose-dependent manner in adipocytes (24Botion L.M. Green A. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We extend the previous studies in adipocytes by showing the combined effects of insulin and glucose on lipolysis are most likely due to effects on HSL expression, because in high glucose media insulin caused a sustained increase in HSL activity and expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, whereas no effect was seen in low glucose. However, the regulation of HSL expression and activity in macrophages is clearly different from that in adipocytes and β-cells. Chronic exposure of cells to insulin, and in particular leptin, in low glucose slightly increased HSL expression and activity, which agrees with our previous findings (23O'Rourke L. Yeaman S.J. Shepherd P.R. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 955-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This would tend to protect macrophages from increases in lipid accumulation. In the case of leptin, this fits with the hypothesis that one of the physiological roles of leptin is to prevent lipid accumulation in peripheral cells (38Unger R.H. Zhou Y. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 2327-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Although increases in glucose concentrations had no direct effect on HSL expression, they did act to prime the cells such that addition of leptin or insulin caused a reduction in HSL expression and activity. Therefore, glucose acts synergistically with leptin or insulin to down-regulate HSL activity in macrophages. This effect is most likely an effect on expression rather than alterations in post-translation modification-induced changes in intrinsic activity because the changes in activity correlate closely with the changes in level of protein. The down-regulation would certainly act to promote CE accumulation in J774.2 macrophages where HSL accounts for so much of the nCEH activity. This is supported by the recent finding (21Okazaki H. Osuga J.I. Tsukamoto K. Isoo N. Kitamine T. Tamura Y. Tomita S. Sekiya M. Yahagi N. Iizuka Y. Okhashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Shimano H. Kimura S. Nagai R. Yamada N. Ishibashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31893-31899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that overexpression of HSL stimulates cholesterol ester clearance in human macrophages. We have recently found that HSL is expressed at readily detectable levels in human macrophages (data not shown), meaning that these findings are also likely to have relevance in cholesterol ester metabolism in humans. In summary, our findings demonstrate that a combination of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia or hyperleptinemia stimulate CE synthesis in J774.2 macrophages. We have also identified three mechanisms by which high glucose levels play a permissive role in this process: increased uptake of modified LDL, increased ACAT activity, and decreased nCEH activity associated with HSL. This contrasts with adipocytes where HSL is up-regulated in the presence of high glucose and insulin. These findings could explain why lipolysis is increased in adipocytes in the insulin-resistant state, and circulating free fatty acid levels rise while cholesterol ester hydrolysis in macrophages is apparently reduced. The finding that these effects of insulin and leptin were only observed in the presence of glucose concentrations corresponding to hyperglycemia in vivo is particularly interesting because this could explain why foam cell formation is particularly accelerated in insulin-resistant individuals and why death from ischemic heart disease correlates closely with blood glucose levels (10Khaw K. Wareham N. Luben R. Bingham S. Oakes S. Welch A. Day N. Br. Med. J. 2001; 322: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, this identifies a previously unrecognized mechanism that if present in human macrophages could contribute to the increased incidence of atherosclerosis in insulin resistant, obese, and diabetic subjects.

The Bcl-2 family of proteins plays a pivotal role in the regulation of mitochondrial integrity and response to apoptotic signals (1Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Histol. Histopathol. 1998; 13: 521-530PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins prevent the release of apoptogenic molecules from the intermembrane space of mitochondria, whereas pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family induce those events. In addition, the Bcl-2 family proteins have been reported to control the mitochondrial function such as the permeability transition pore opening through adenine nucleotide translocator or voltage-dependent anion channel, ADP/ATP exchange, or oxidative phosphorylation during apoptosis (1Green D.R.

Although the relative ratio of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members is known to affect the mitochondrial homeostasis, the molecular mechanism underlying the release of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins remains elusive. Bcl-2 family proteins contain up to four evolutionarily conserved domains called Bcl-2 homology (BH)1 domains 1 to 4 (15Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Histol. Histopathol. 1998; 13: 521-530PubMed Google Scholar,19Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4754) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL share all the conserved BH domains (BH1–4) and can interact with pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. In contrast, the pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family are divided into the BH1–3 multidomain and BH3-only subgroups. It has been shown that the pro-apoptotic BH1–3 proteins Bax and Bak have redundant function and are required for the induction of apoptosis in response to a variety of death signals (20Lindsten T.

The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL can inhibit BH1–3 protein activation, whereas the BH3-only proteins promote it. It has been suggested that BH3-only proteins induce the activation of BH1–3 proteins by direct binding to these multidomain pro-apoptotic molecules or indirect inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (38Green D.R. Evan G.I. Cancer Cells. 2002; 1: 19-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). BH3-only proteins such as Bad, Bid, Noxa, Puma, Bim, and Bmf have been shown to absolutely require Bax or Bak to induce mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death as demonstrated in Bax and Bak double knock-out cells (21Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Evidence has accumulated that the BH3-only proteins transduce diverse proximal apoptotic signals to the BH1–3 multidomain proteins by a variety of post-translational modifications or transcriptional regulation (38Green D.R.

For example, Bad is phosphorylated and inactivated by several survival protein kinases, whereas Bid is activated through proteolysis by caspase-8, Granzyme B, or lysosomal proteases. Noxa and Puma are induced by p53 in response to DNA damage, whereas Bmf is activated by release from the cytoskeleton compartment after anoikis stimulation. Bim is another BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 protein family whose expression is induced by growth factor withdrawal or T-cell receptor-CD3 stimulation (43Bouillet P. Metcalf D. Huang D.C.

We have reported previously that the survival protein kinase Akt inhibits Bax conformational change and its translocation to mitochondria (29Yamaguchi H. Wang H.-G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Akt has been shown recently to phosphorylate and inhibit Forkhead transcription factors that induce several pro-apoptotic proteins including Bim (46Shinjyo T. Kuribara R. Inukai T. Hosoi H.

These findings suggest that Bim might have a pivotal role in activation of the pro-apoptotic Bax protein, which is regulated by Akt. In this study, therefore, we investigated the possible involvement of Bim in Bax conformational change and its redistribution to the mitochondrial membranes. We show that BimEL triggers Bax conformational change and cytochromec release, which can be suppressed by Bcl-XL but is independent from its ability to heterodimerize with this anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein. Anti-Bax (N-20) polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Bim, HA, and FLAG polyclonal antibodies, anti-Bax (6A7) monoclonal antibody, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, and anti-FLAG M2-conjugated agarose were purchased from Sigma. Anti-HA monoclonal antibody was purchased from BAbCO. Anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody was obtained from BD PharMingen. Anti-COX IV monoclonal antibody was purchased from Molecular Probes. Cellular membrane-permeable Bak-BH3 peptide was described previously (33Yamaguchi H. Paranawithana S.R. Lee M.W. Huang Z. Bhalla K.N. Wang H.-G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 466-471PubMed Google Scholar). 293T and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. MDA-MB-468 and DU145 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. HeLa cells and MDA-MB-468 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus), respectively, according to the manufacturers' instructions. The BimEL cDNA was amplified by PCR from human fetal brain cDNA library and cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with EcoRI and XhoI sites. Bim deletion mutants and point mutations were generated by PCR with BimEL as template and cloned into pcDNA3 vector byEcoRI/XhoI. The FLAG-Bim expression plasmids were generated by subcloning Bim cDNAs from pcDNA3-Bim plasmids into the EcoRI/SalI-digested pFLAG-CMV2 vector. The pcDNA3-Bcl-XL mutant 1 (mt1) was generated by two-step PCR with pcDNA3-Bcl-XL as template to substitute Phe131 and Asp133 for alanines. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The Bim cDNAs were subcloned into a pET (Novagen) vector in frame with the N-terminal His6tag sequences. The recombinant His6-Bim proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) strain Escherichia coli and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), according to manufacturer's recommendation. The purified His6-BimEL fusion proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and stored at −80 °C. HeLa cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected with various combinations of Bim and Bcl-XL expression plasmids, together with 10 ng of pGL3 encoding luciferase under the control of β-actin promoter. After 24 h, cells were washed, harvested, and subjected to luciferase assay with luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (142.5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 m EGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) or Chaps lysis buffer (29Yamaguchi H. Wang H.-G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) supplemented with protease inhibitors (29Yamaguchi H. Wang H.-G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were normalized for protein content and subjected to immunoprecipitation by incubation of 500 μg of total proteins with 20 μl of anti-FLAG M2 beads or protein G-agarose preadsorbed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody in 500 μl of the same lysis buffer at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing three times with the same lysis buffer, the beads were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and the eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Active Bax was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-Bax 6A7 antibody, which recognizes only the conformationally changed Bax protein in Chaps lysis buffer (53Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in Chaps lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (29Yamaguchi H. Wang H.-G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and 500 μg of total protein was incubated with 2 μg of anti-Bax 6A7 monoclonal antibody in 500 μl of Chaps lysis buffer at 4 °C for 2 h. Then, 20 μl of protein G-agarose was added into the reactions and incubated at 4 °C for an additional 2 h, followed by extensive washing in the same lysis buffer and SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis with anti-Bax polyclonal antibody (33Yamaguchi H. Paranawithana S.R. Lee M.W. Huang Z. Bhalla K.N. Wang H.-G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 466-471PubMed Google Scholar). The subcellular fractionation experiments were performed as described previously (29Yamaguchi H. Wang H.-G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 33Yamaguchi H. Paranawithana S.R. Lee M.W. Huang Z. Bhalla K.N. Wang H.-G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 466-471PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were homogenized in isotonic mitochondrial buffer (210 mm sucrose, 70 mm mannitol, 10 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to discard nuclei and unbroken cells. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to pellet mitochondria-enriched heavy membrane fraction, and the supernatant was centrifuged further at 100,000 × g for 30 min to obtain cytosolic (S-100) fraction. Cells were lysed in isotonic mitochondrial buffer with a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 1,000 × gfor 10 min, the supernatant was centrifuged further at 10,000 ×g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended with isotonic mitochondrial buffer and centrifuged again at 1,000 ×g for 5 min to remove residual nuclei. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min to obtain purified mitochondria. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in mitochondria assay buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mmEGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mmKH2PO4, 5 mm succinate, pH 7.4), and the protein concentration was measured by BCA assay (Pierce). To obtain S-100 for in vitro assay, the cells were homogenized in mitochondria assay buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 10 min, followed by further centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant (S-100) was adjusted to 10 mg/ml total proteins and kept at −80 °C for future assays. The purified mitochondria (300–500 μg of total protein) were incubated with His6-BimEL recombinant proteins or Bak-BH3 peptide in 100 μl of mitochondria assay buffer or S-100 at 30 °C for the indicated times and subjected to the following assays. For cytochrome c release assay, the samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and 20 μl of the resulting supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis with anti-cytochrome c antibody. For detection of Bax conformational change, 10% Chaps, 5 m NaCl, and 1m Hepes, pH 7.5, were added to the samples to a final concentration of 1% Chaps, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm Hepes in a total volume of 200 μl. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Bax 6A7 antibody to determine the conformationally changed Bax protein. For alkali lysis assay, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min, and the pellets (mitochondria) were resuspended in 1 ml of freshly prepared 0.1 mNa2CO3, pH 11.5. After 30 min on ice incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis. The outer membrane fraction of mitochondria was prepared as described (54Lan L. Isenmann S. Wattenberg B.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified mitochondria from Du145 cells were resuspended in 10 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.4, and stirred on ice for 30 min. The resulting suspension was homogenized gently with a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged twice at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were centrifuged further at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain mitochondrial outer membrane (pellet) fraction. To elucidate the mechanisms by which Bim activates Bax, we first prepared Bim mutant expression plasmids by deletion of the C terminus hydrophobic region (ΔC), substitution of Leu152in BH3 domain for alanine (M1), or mutation of both (M1ΔC) in BimEL (Fig. 1 A) and expressed these Bim proteins in HeLa cells. The effects of these Bim mutants on cell viability was determined by luciferase assay (Fig. 1 B), Bax conformational change was examined by immunoprecipitation with anti-Bax 6A7 antibody (Fig. 1 C), and Bax translocation to mitochondria was detected by subcellular fractionation/immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 D). Overexpression of wild type BimEL exhibited the highest pro-apoptotic activity and most efficiently induced Bax conformational change and its translocation to mitochondria compared with the Bim mutants. The ΔC or M1 mutant also induced cell death and Bax activation, but their activities appeared to be a little weaker than that of the wild type BimEL protein. In contrast, the M1ΔC mutation completely abrogated the ability of BimEL to trigger apoptosis and to induce Bax conformational change and mitochondrial redistribution. These results indicate that the pro-apoptotic activity of the BH3-mutated BimEL protein requires its C-terminal hydrophobic region, although deletion of this hydrophobic domain alone does not much affect BimEL to induce apoptosis and Bax conformational change. It has been supposed that the hydrophobic region of BH3-only proteins may function as membrane targeting sequences (40Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 D, BimEL was localized in the mitochondria-enriched heavy membrane fraction as reported previously (48U M. Miyashita T. Shikama Y. Tadokoro K. Yamada M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 55O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). The BH3 mutant of BimEL (M1) was still localized predominantly on mitochondria compared with the ΔC mutant that resided in both cytosolic and heavy membrane fractions. However, the intracellular localization of M1ΔC was only found in the cytosol, indicating that both the C terminus hydrophobic region and the BH3 domain are required for the mitochondrial localization of BimEL, which may be critical for BimEL-mediated Bax activation and apoptosis. It has been reported that Bid, a member of the BH3-only subfamily, triggers Bax conformational change and subsequent oligomerization and insertion into mitochondrial membranes by direct binding of Bid to Bax (24Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 56Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Similar to Bid, BimS and BimAD have also been shown to be capable of interacting with Bax (49Marani M. Tenev T. Hancock D. Downward J. Lemoine N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3577-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Therefore, we confirmed Bax association with BimEL or Bcl-XL by co-immunoprecipitation in the presence of Nonidet P-40versus Chaps; it has been shown that Nonidet P-40 causes Bax conformational change whereas Chaps keeps Bax in its native conformation (53Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous reports (49Marani M. Tenev T. Hancock D. Downward J.

https://openalex.org/W2031890603,"Most of the currently available information on the transcriptional activities of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (xenoestrogens) through estrogen receptors α (ERα) and β (ERβ) has been derived from transactivation studies on synthetic estrogen-responsive reporters. Thus, the ability of the xenoestrogen-liganded ERs to regulate endogenous estrogen-responsive gene expression has not been well characterized. Here, we have evaluated the activities of xenoestrogens through ERα and ERβ on the vitellogenin A2 estrogen-response element (ERE) and the human pS2, lactoferrin, and complement 3 physiological target gene promoters. Using mammalian cell transient transfection assays, we found that the activities of xenoestrogens were mediated in a promoter-specific manner. For example, when bound to all ligands examined, ERα displayed high levels of transcription on the vitellogenin ERE and the lactoferrin promoter, but substantially lower activity on the complement 3 and pS2 promoters. However, one of the most important observations was that there were significant differences in the relative transcriptional activities of xenoestrogen-bound ERα and ERβ on different promoters, suggesting that ERα and ERβ make unique contributions to xenoestrogen action in target cells. When probing the molecular mechanism of the promoter-specific activities observed, we found that the transcriptional activity of the ERs correlated with the ability of each receptor to assume an active conformation on specific promoters. Taken together, the results indicate that the transcriptional activities of xenoestrogens are mediated in a promoter-specific manner and that estrogen-responsive promoters communicate differently with ERα and ERβ by influencing their structures in a distinct manner that leads to diversity in their transcriptional responses. Most of the currently available information on the transcriptional activities of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (xenoestrogens) through estrogen receptors α (ERα) and β (ERβ) has been derived from transactivation studies on synthetic estrogen-responsive reporters. Thus, the ability of the xenoestrogen-liganded ERs to regulate endogenous estrogen-responsive gene expression has not been well characterized. Here, we have evaluated the activities of xenoestrogens through ERα and ERβ on the vitellogenin A2 estrogen-response element (ERE) and the human pS2, lactoferrin, and complement 3 physiological target gene promoters. Using mammalian cell transient transfection assays, we found that the activities of xenoestrogens were mediated in a promoter-specific manner. For example, when bound to all ligands examined, ERα displayed high levels of transcription on the vitellogenin ERE and the lactoferrin promoter, but substantially lower activity on the complement 3 and pS2 promoters. However, one of the most important observations was that there were significant differences in the relative transcriptional activities of xenoestrogen-bound ERα and ERβ on different promoters, suggesting that ERα and ERβ make unique contributions to xenoestrogen action in target cells. When probing the molecular mechanism of the promoter-specific activities observed, we found that the transcriptional activity of the ERs correlated with the ability of each receptor to assume an active conformation on specific promoters. Taken together, the results indicate that the transcriptional activities of xenoestrogens are mediated in a promoter-specific manner and that estrogen-responsive promoters communicate differently with ERα and ERβ by influencing their structures in a distinct manner that leads to diversity in their transcriptional responses. The steroid hormone estrogen is a key regulator of the cellular processes involved in the growth and differentiation of a wide variety of target tissues of diverse functions. The predominant biological effects of estrogen are mediated through two intracellular receptors (ERα and ERβ) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen-response element; E2, 17β-estradiol; 3-TCB, 4-hydroxy-2′,4′,6′-trichlorobiphenyl; 4-CB, 4-hydroxy-2′,3′,4′,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl that belong to the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel T. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M.

The classical mechanism of ER action is similar to that of other nuclear receptors (3Hall J.M. Couse J.F. Korach K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36869-36872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). In the absence of hormone, the receptor is sequestered within the nuclei of target cells in an inactive state. The binding of ligand induces an activating conformational change within the ER and promotes homodimerization and high affinity binding to specific DNA response elements (EREs), which are cis-acting enhancers located within the regulatory regions of target genes. The DNA-bound receptors contact the general transcription apparatus either directly or indirectly via cofactor proteins (reviewed in Ref. 4McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). ER-coactivator interactions stabilize the formation of a transcription preinitiation complex and facilitate the necessary disruption of chromatin at the ERE. Depending on the cell and promoter context, the DNA-bound receptor exerts either a positive or negative effect on expression of the downstream target gene. In addition to the endogenous hormone estradiol, ER activity can be modulated by chemicals in the environment termed xenoestrogens, which include natural plant compounds (phytoestrogens) and industrial byproducts (industrial estrogens). In the past several decades, there has been increasing awareness and concern about the endocrine-disrupting effects of these chemicals and their impact on humans and wildlife (5Carson R. Silent Spring. Houghton Mifflin, Boston, MA1994Google Scholar, 6Colburn T. Dumanoski A. Meyers J.P. Our Stolen Future. Penguin Books Inc., New York, NY1996Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms of xenoestrogens are not well understood, it is clear that many of these chemicals function by binding ERs and blocking estrogen access (7McLachlan J.A. Environ. Health Perspect. 1993; 101: 386-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In addition to their potential antagonist activities, however, xenoestrogens can also induce activating conformational changes in ERs that enable the receptors to interact with coactivators and to activate target gene transcription (8Routledge E.J.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 469-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). An additional level of complexity in ER action was revealed by studies demonstrating that the transcriptional activity of estradiol-liganded ERα is significantly influenced by the nature of the target promoter (11Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 12Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielian P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The majority of known estrogen-responsive genes contain permutations of the consensus vitellogenin ERE (GGTCAcagTGACC) within their regulatory regions (reviewed in Ref. 13Klinge C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2905-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the nature of the ERE sequence can influence the ability of xenoestrogen-bound ERs to recruit coactivators and to activate target gene transcription (10Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Korach K.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 469-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, native estrogen-responsive promoters also contain binding sites for other transcription factors, which can impact on the activity of ERs (14Nunez A.M. Berry M. Imler J.L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar,15Liu Y. Yang N. Teng C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1836-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, although ERE reporter assays for xenoestrogen activity are informative with regard to the potential of environmental chemicals to activate ERs, they do not predict the activity of xenoestrogens on physiological target gene promoters. In this study, we hypothesized that the nature of the estrogen-responsive promoter would influence the activity of endocrine-disrupting chemicals through ERs, akin to the way in which selective estrogen receptor modulators manifest their gene-specific activities. Thus, we have used a panel of xenoestrogens and native estrogen-responsive promoters to investigate whether xenoestrogen ligands display promoter-specific activities through ERα and ERβ. This study provides the first systematic assessment of xenoestrogen activity through the two ER subtypes on physiological target promoters and furthermore reveals a regulatory role for different promoters in ER structure and function. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA) or Promega (Madison, WI). PCR reagents were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences or Promega. 17β-Estradiol (E2), genistein, and zearalenone were purchased from Sigma. Coumestrol was obtained from Acros Organics (Morris Plains, NJ). Bisphenol A was purchased from Aldrich. Nonylphenol was purchased from Schenectady International (Schenectady, NY). 4-Hydroxy-2′,4′,6′-trichlorobiphenyl (4-TCB) and 4-hydroxy-2′,3′,4′,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl (4-CB) were purchased from Ultra Scientific (North Kingstown, RI). The mammalian expression plasmids for ERα (pcDNA-hERα) and ERβ (pcDNA-hERβ) contain the cDNAs of human ERα and ERβ subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The reporter pS2-Luc (a gift from Dr. V. Giguere, McGill University) contains the estrogen-responsive pS2 gene promoter fused upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. The 3x-Vit-ERE-TATA-Luc reporter contains three copies of the vitellogenin ERE in the pGL2-TATA-Inr plasmid (a gift from Dr. D. P. McDonnell, Duke University Medical Center). C3-Luc contains the human complement 3 gene promoter (16Norris J.D. Fan D. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1605-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Lf-Luc was constructed as follows. The estrogen-responsive human lactoferrin gene promoter was PCR-amplified from the 2.6mL14-CAT plasmid (a gift from Dr. C. T. Teng) (17Liu Y. Teng C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21880-21885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pGL2-basic vector (Promega). The sequences of the oligonucleotides for PCR were 5′-gtggacctcgaggctttcacatcattagaattc and 3′-gtggacaagcttgtctgtggtcttgggagacc. pVP16-RIP140 contains the RIP140 coding sequence fused in-frame downstream of the VP16 activation domain in the pVP16 mammalian expression plasmid (Invitrogen). HepG2 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Cells were plated in 24-well plates (coated with 0.1% gelatin) 24 h prior to transfection. DNA was introduced into the cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In standard transfections, 500 ng of reporter (3x-Vit-ERE-TATA-Luc, pS2-Luc, Lf-Luc, or C3-Luc), 90 ng of receptor (either pcDNA-hERα or pcDNA-hERβ), and 10 ng of the pRL-CMV Renillaluciferase normalization vector (Promega) were used for each well, and all transfections were performed in triplicate. For two-hybrid analyses, 500 ng of pVP16 or pVP16-RIP140 were used for each well in addition to the components described above. Prior to transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 200 μl of phenol red-free minimal essential medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) were added to each well. Cells were incubated with the DNA/FuGENE 6 mixture for 6 h, and then receptor ligands in 200 μl of phenol red-free minimal essential medium were added to the cells and incubated for 20 h. Luciferase assays were performed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Each value was normalized to theRenilla luciferase control, and each data point generated is the average of triplicate determinations. All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times, and reproducible results were obtained in independent experiments. Transient transfection assays were performed to evaluate the transcriptional activities of xenoestrogen-bound ERα and ERβ on different estrogen-responsive promoters. We elected to use HepG2 (human hepatoma) cells for our studies because they require exogenous ERα or ERβ to activate ERE-mediated transcription, enabling an assessment of the transcriptional responses of each receptor in isolation (18Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5566-5578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were cotransfected with an ERα or ERβ expression plasmid together with a firefly luciferase reporter vector and the pRL-CMVRenilla luciferase normalization vector. The reporter constructs contained three copies of the vitellogenin ERE (Fig.1 A) or the estrogen-responsive promoters from the pS2, lactoferrin, and complement 3 genes (3x-Vit-ERE-TATA-Luc, pS2-Luc, Lf-Luc, and C3-Luc, respectively). The 3x-Vit-ERE-TATA-Luc reporter was used as a positive control because previous studies showed that both ERα and ERβ display high levels of activity on this promoter (18Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5566-5578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hall J.M. Chang C.-Y McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2010-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the vitellogenin ERE assay is currently a standard method for detecting xenoestrogen activity in cell culture systems (20Petit F., Le Goff P. Cravedi J.-P. Valotaire Y. Pakdel F. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 19: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 21Kuiper G.G.J.M. Lemmon J.G. Carlsson B. Corton J.C. Safe S.H. Saag P.T.V.D. Burg B.V.D. Gustafsson J.-A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4252-4263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pS2, lactoferrin, and C3 gene full regulatory sequences were used, permitting a comparison of ER transactivation on physiological ER target gene promoters. Representation of the data as -fold activation enabled us to evaluate the ER-dependent transcriptional response in isolation on the complex promoters. Using this system, the transcriptional responses of ERα and ERβ were examined over a range of concentrations of different ER ligands, including the endogenous ligand E2 and a series of known biologically active xenoestrogens (Fig. 1 B). To ensure that affinity did not influence the maximal response achieved for each ligand, each study was carried out at a ligand concentration that yielded saturating levels of reporter activity as determined by dose-response studies. With respect to ERα, E2 displayed the greatest efficacy (26.1-fold activation) on the 3x-Vit-ERE reporter (Fig. 2), whereas no transcriptional response was detected on the pGL2 parent vector containing no ERE sequences (data not shown). Significant activity was also observed on the lactoferrin promoter (11.5-fold), whereas substantially lower responses were observed on the C3 and pS2 promoters (4.8- and 2.3-fold, respectively). Similarly, the greatest efficacy was observed on the 3x-Vit-ERE and lactoferrin promoters for all of the xenoestrogens tested in the assay (Fig. 2). Notably, however, the relative activity of ERα on the four promoters was consistent for most of the ligands examined. In some instances, the potencies (EC50) were also influenced by the promoter context (Figs.3 and 4); for example, coumestrol-bound ERα displayed EC50 values of 0.8, 0.2, 7.4, and 1.7 nm on the 3x-Vit-ERE, C3, pS2, and lactoferrin promoters, respectively. Some differences between ligands were observed, as the industrial estrogens bisphenol A, nonylphenol, 3-TCB, and 4-CB were less potent in ERα activation in most circumstances than E2 or the phytoestrogens studied (Fig.4), likely due to their lower affinities for the receptor (21Kuiper G.G.J.M. Lemmon J.G. Carlsson B. Corton J.C. Safe S.H. Saag P.T.V.D. Burg B.V.D. Gustafsson J.-A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4252-4263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kuiper G.G.J.M. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Häggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar). Cumulatively, these studies demonstrate that the activities of E2 and xenoestrogens through ERα are mediated in a promoter-specific manner.Figure 3Promoter context influences the potency of estradiol and xenoestrogen ligands in transactivation of ER α.Dose-response curves were generated to study the effect of promoter context on the potency of estradiol and xenoestrogen ligands for ERα. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with an ERα expression vector together with the pRL-CMV normalization plasmid and the 3x-Vit-ERE-TATA-Luc, pS2-Luc, Lf-Luc, or C3-Luc reporter plasmid. Following transfection, full dose-response curves were generated by treating cells with vehicle (nh) or increasing concentrations (ranging from 10−11 to 10−5m) of E2, genistein (Gen), coumestrol (Coum), zearalenone (Zear), bisphenol A (BPA), nonylphenol (NP), 3-TCB, or 4-CB. After 20 h, cells were harvested, and luciferase assays were performed. Each value was normalized to the internal luciferase control, and triplicate determinations from a representative experiment were averaged to yield each data point. The average coefficient of variance for each value is <10%. Percent maximal ERα activity on each promoter was calculated by expressing each value as a percent of the maximal activity obtained (set at 100%). Results were highly reproducible in independent experiments for each condition examined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Potency of xenoestrogens in transcriptional activation of ER α and ER β is influenced by the promoter context. The transcriptional activities of estradiol- or xenoestrogen-activated ERα and ERβ were examined in HepG2 cells on the estrogen-responsive pS2, lactoferrin, and complement 3 promoters or on three copies of the vitellogenin A2 gene ERE. Full dose-response curves were generated by treatment with vehicle or increasing concentrations (ranging from 10−11 to 10−4m) of E2, genistein (Gen), coumestrol (Coum), zearalenone (Zear), bisphenol A (BPA), nonylphenol (NP), 3-TCB, or 4-CB. Data are represented as the EC50 value (nanomolar) under each of the conditions examined, and ligand potency is inversely related to the magnitude of the EC50 values. EC50 values (ligand concentration (nanomolar) of half-maximal activation) were determined using the Hill equation: E(y) =b + (vd n/(k n +d n)), where y is the response of interest, E(y) is the expected value of the response of interest, d is the dose level, b is the intercept term, k is the estimated EC50,v is the maximal response, and n is the Hill exponent (shape parameter). *, the EC50 values for zearalenone-liganded ERα on the lactoferrin promoter and 3-TCB-liganded ERα on the pS2 promoter are not shown, as accurate values could not be calculated from the dose-response data. **, the EC50 values for bisphenol A-liganded ERβ on the pS2 promoter and 3-TCB-liganded ERβ on the lactoferrin promoter are 1467 ± 129 nm and 8121 ± 1057 nm, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Transactivation by E2- or xenoestrogen-bound ERβ was next examined to assess any ER subtype-specific activities (Fig.5). Like ERα, E2 displayed the greatest efficacy (21-fold) on 3x-Vit-ERE. However, the relative activity of ERβ on the four promoters was distinct from that seen for ERα: specifically, for ERα, 3x-Vit-ERE > lactoferrin > C3 > pS2 (26.1-, 11.5-, 4.8-, and 2.3-fold activation, respectively); and for ERβ, vitellogenin ERE > C3 > lactoferrin > pS2 (21-, 16-, 9.2-, and 7.3-fold, respectively) (Figs. 2 and 5). Furthermore, although ERα displayed lower -fold activation on C3 compared with the lactoferrin promoter for all ligands examined (Fig. 2), the reverse was true for ERβ with the majority of the compounds (Fig. 5). Notably, the pS2 and C3 promoters were more responsive to ERβ than ERα (compare Figs. 2 and 5); this observation further illustrates promoter-specific differences in the transcriptional activities of the two receptors. The relative activities of ERβ on the vitellogenin ERE and C3 promoter were similar for E2 and most of the xenoestrogens studied; and for several of the ligands, the order of efficacy was vitellogenin ERE > C3 > pS2 = lactoferrin. Analysis of ERβ transcriptional activity also revealed promoter- and ER subtype-specific effects on ligand potency. Notably, the potencies of E2, genistein, coumestrol, zearalenone, bisphenol A, nonylphenol, and 3-TCB through ERβ were significantly influenced by the nature of the promoter utilized (Figs. 4 and6). Most striking were data from the lactoferrin promoter, on which nonylphenol displayed remarkably high potency and coumestrol displayed very low potency compared with the other promoters utilized. Notably, the EC50 values of each of the ligands examined were distinct when assayed on ERα and ERβ (Fig. 4). Unlike ERα, coumestrol displayed higher potency through ERβ than E2 in all promoter contexts, indicating a degree of ER specificity in ligand response. Further promoter-specific differences between the two ER subtypes were illustrated by the apparent biphasic character of 4-CB through ERβ on the lactoferrin promoter, whereas 4-CB displayed biphasic properties and was a very potent activator of ERα on the pS2 promoter (Figs. 3 and 6). All studies were repeated in Ishikawa (human endometrial carcinoma) and UCI107 (human ovarian carcinoma) cells, in which promoter- and ER subtype-specific effects were also observed on the potencies and efficacies of E2 and the seven xenoestrogens examined (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that ER-mediated transcriptional activation by xenoestrogens is dependent on the ligand and promoter context and that there are promoter-specific differences in the transcriptional activities of ERα and ERβ. The ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of the ERs is mediated by agonist-induced conformational changes in the AF-2 region that enable the receptors to interact with cellular coactivators (4McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism by which different estrogen-responsive promoters could differentially regulate transcriptional activation by the ER is through inducing distinct conformational changes in the receptor at the AF-2 coactivator-binding pocket. The AF-2 cofactor RIP140 binds the agonist-activated ERs and functions as a repressor of ligand-activated transcription by competing for coactivator binding (4McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). This property allows for the use of RIP140 as a probe to detect the transcriptionally active conformation of ERα in the absence of receptor activation. 2D. L. Swope and K. S. Korach (2001) Poster presented at the 83rd Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society, Denver, CO (June 20–23, 2001), Poster 582. In this study, to test the hypothesis that the specific promoter influences formation of an active receptor, the ability of the xenoestrogen-bound ERs to interact with the cofactor RIP140 was tested in different promoter contexts using a mammalian two-hybrid assay (Fig.7). Control experiments demonstrated that RIP140 completely suppressed the activity of agonist-activated ERα and ERβ, regardless of the nature of the ERE-containing promoter (data not shown). Thus, when RIP140 is fused to the VP16 activation domain, RIP140 suppresses ER activity while still enabling VP16 activity to be manifest when tethered to DNA by recognizing the activated form of the ER. Accordingly, when assayed on an ERE-containing promoter, transcriptional activity is proportional to the ER-RIP140 interaction without transcriptional interference from the ER component. Titration experiments were used to determine the concentration of VP16-RIP140 that yielded maximal interaction with the ERs in all promoter contexts, which was still in the linear range of transcription in each instance. To examine the effect of the promoter context on ER-RIP140 interactions, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with an ERα or ERβ expression plasmid together with pVP16-RIP140, the pRL-CMV normalization vector, and the 3x-Vit-ERE-TATA-Luc, pS2-Luc, Lf-Luc, or C3-Luc reporter. Control experiments performed in parallel revealed no effect of the empty pVP16 vector on ER transcriptional activity under any of the conditions examined (data not shown). When E2- or genistein-bound ERα was tested in the assay, the order of RIP140 binding efficacy on the four promoters was vitellogenin ERE > lactoferrin > C3 > pS2, whereas for E2- or genistein-bound ERβ, the order was vitellogenin ERE > C3 > pS2 = lactoferrin (Fig. 7). Importantly, these results correlate with the relative maximal transcriptional activities of ERα and ERβ on the four reporters (Figs. 2 and 5). A similar relationship between the efficacy and relative degree of RIP140 interaction on the different promoters was noted when other receptor agonists were tested in the assay (data not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that different estrogen-responsive promoters may influence the ability of the ER to form a transcriptionally active conformation, providing a mechanism for the promoter-specific activities observed. Furthermore, differences in the relative transcriptional activities of ERα and ERβ on distinct promoters may be due to receptor-specific effects of each promoter on the formation of an active receptor conformation. One of the most significant findings of this study was that xenoestrogens do not activate transcription from all estrogen-responsive promoters in an equivalent manner. Notably, when the activities of a series of receptor agonists (estradiol, phytoestrogens, and industrial estrogens) for ERα and ERβ were examined, significant diversity in ligand responsiveness was observed on the native pS2, lactoferrin, and complement 3 promoters. Interestingly, this is reminiscent of a different class of ER ligands, selective estrogen receptor modulators, which are also known to display promoter-specific biological activities. For example, the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen functions as an ERα agonist on the complement 3 gene promoter (16Norris J.D. Fan D. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1605-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), but as an antagonist of pS2 gene expression. 3J. M. Hall, D. P. McDonnell, and K. S. Korach, unpublished data. Importantly, as seen for tamoxifen, it is likely that the promoter-specific activities of xenoestrogens will result in differential estrogen-responsive gene expression. This provides a potential mechanism by which endocrine-disrupting chemicals could mimic the biological effects of estrogen in some contexts and antagonize hormone action in others as a means of mediating their diverse biological effects. Previous studies demonstrated that on target promoters, ERs can synergize with other steroid receptors and a host of DNA-binding proteins, including AP-1, Sp1, NF-1, OTF, and CP1 (24Schüle R. Muller M. Kaltschmidt C. Renkawitz R. Science. 1988; 242: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 25Pearce D. Matsui W. Miner J.N. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30081-30085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that in some instances, the promoter-specific ER activities observed could reflect cooperative interactions between ERs and other transcription factors. This would not be surprising given that the pS2, lactoferrin, and C3 promoters contain binding sites for diverse cellular regulatory proteins (14Nunez A.M. Berry M. Imler J.L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 15Liu Y. Yang N. Teng C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1836-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Norris J.D. Fan D. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1605-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). An additional factor is the contribution of the ERE sequence to the promoter-specific ER activity observed. Each of the native promoters examined contains an imperfect ERE, which diverges from the consensus vitellogenin element by at least 1 bp (Fig.8). Although originally it was considered that the ERE functioned simply as a means to tether the ER to DNA, a series of recent reports have indicated a functional role for imperfect ERE sequences (13Klinge C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2905-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 26Dana S.L. Hoener P.A. Wheeler D.A. Lawrence C.B. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1193-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Klinge C.M. Jernigan S.C. Smith S.L. Tyulmenkov V.V. Kulakosky P.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 174: 151-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Wood J.R. Likhite V.S. Loven M.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this regard, it was shown that receptor affinities for many of the imperfect EREs are similar, even though ER transcriptional activity depends on the nature of the response element. The observation that ER-ERE affinity does not correlate with transcriptional activity suggests that information encoded in the specific sequences is interpreted by the receptor in a manner that impacts on transcriptional activity. We recently demonstrated that the nature of the ERE sequence influences the transcriptional activities of estradiol- or xenoestrogen-bound ERα and ERβ. Interestingly, these studies also revealed that different DNA response elements induce distinct conformations in the ER coactivator pocket, leading to differential cofactor recruitment and gene response (10Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Korach K.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 469-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The observation that transcriptional activity on native estrogen-responsive promoters often correlates with cofactor recruitment on the corresponding ERE sequences3 further indicates that the response element sequence is an important determinant of ER promoter-specific transcriptional activity by xenoestrogen ligands. Complementary to these findings, the use of RIP140 as a probe for the active receptor conformation in this study demonstrated that estrogen-responsive promoters regulate ER transcriptional activity by influencing receptor structure. The future use of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to detect coactivator-binding preferences on physiological target promoters should provide additional insights into the mechanisms by which the ERs display their gene-specific activities. Our data also demonstrate that the transcriptional activities of ERα and ERβ are dependent on the nature of the bound ligand. Specifically, we found that different xenoestrogens range from full to partial receptor agonists on the various promoters studied. The potencies in transactivation of ERα and ERβ were significantly lower for the industrial estrogens, likely reflecting lesser affinity for the receptors (21Kuiper G.G.J.M. Lemmon J.G. Carlsson B. Corton J.C. Safe S.H. Saag P.T.V.D. Burg B.V.D. Gustafsson J.-A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4252-4263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this does not account for their differences in maximal ligand-dependent gene induction. Furthermore, although phytoestrogens also display significantly lower affinities for ERα and ERβ than estradiol (21Kuiper G.G.J.M. Lemmon J.G. Carlsson B. Corton J.C. Safe S.H. Saag P.T.V.D. Burg B.V.D. Gustafsson J.-A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4252-4263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that the potencies and efficacies of the phytoestrogens studied were often similar to or higher than those of estradiol. This was illustrated by coumestrol, which displayed higher potency through ERβ than estradiol in all promoter contexts examined. Thus, differing affinities cannot fully explain the ligand-dependent transcriptional activities observed. The idea that ligands play an active role in ER function was proposed by McDonnell and coworkers (29McDonnell D.P. Clemm D.L. Hermann T. Goldman M.E. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 659-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Gron H. Norris J.D. Gottlin E.B. Padilla K.M. Chang C.-Y. Ballas L.M. Hamilton P.T. McDonnell D.P. Proc.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5828-5840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating that different ligands induce distinct conformational changes in the ER, correlating with diversity in transcriptional responses. Our recent studies have also revealed that different xenoestrogen ligands for ERα and ERβ induce distinct conformations in the receptor coactivator-binding pockets, leading to differential cofactor recruitment and biological activity (10Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Korach K.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 469-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we propose that different endocrine-disrupting chemicals mediate their distinct activities through ERα and ERβ by means of their differing abilities to induce transcriptionally active conformations of the receptors and to recruit coactivator proteins. One interest of our laboratory has been defining the roles of ERα and ERβ in estrogen and xenoestrogen biology. We have previously shown that ERα and ERβ are not functionally equivalent and that each receptor plays a different role in ER action in vitro and in vivo (18Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5566-5578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hall J.M. Chang C.-Y McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2010-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32Couse J.F.

Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In this study, although the affinities of xenoestrogen ligands for ERα and ERβ were similar (21Kuiper G.G.J.M. Lemmon J.G. Carlsson B. Corton J.C. Safe S.H. Saag P.T.V.D. Burg B.V.D. Gustafsson J.-A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4252-4263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kuiper G.G.J.M. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Häggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar), the relative ligand-dependent transcriptional responses of the two receptors were distinct in most contexts examined. Notably, estradiol bound both receptors with similar affinity, but was less potent through ERβ on the vitellogenin ERE, as shown previously (18Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5566-5578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One potential explanation is that estradiol- or xenoestrogen-bound ERα and ERβ differ in their abilities to recruit coactivators, as was recently reported by independent laboratories (8Routledge E.J. White R. Parker M.G. Sumpter J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35986-35993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 9An J. Tzagarakis-Foster C. Scharschmidt T.C. Lomri N.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 469-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, these observations do not account for the apparent promoter-specific activities of the two ER subtypes. Because the DNA-binding domains of the two receptors are virtually identical (2Giguere V. Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Steroids. 1998; 63: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), it is possible that ERα and ERβ may interpret the information conveyed by the specific promoter in a different manner. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that different estrogen-responsive promoters differentially influence the ability of ERα and ERβ to assume transcriptionally active conformations. Notably, one factor lending to the divergent activities of ERα and ERβ may be the receptor-specific influence of the response element, as we have shown that different EREs can induce distinct conformational changes in the two ER subtypes, leading to differential coactivator recruitment (10Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Korach K.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 469-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations indicate that estrogen-responsive promoters communicate differently with the two receptors by regulating their structures in a distinct manner. An additional explanation for the promoter-specific activities of ERα and ERβ is differences in the manner by which the receptors influence the activity of other DNA-binding proteins on native estrogen-responsive promoters. In support of this hypothesis, estradiol-bound ERα has been shown to enhance AP-1 transcriptional activity, whereas ERβ is unable to activate transcription of AP-1-regulated genes when bound to ER agonists (34Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Scanlan T.S. Shiau A.K. Uht R.M. Webb P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Cumulatively, these observations indicate the possibility of distinct physiological roles for the two ERs in xenoestrogen biology via the regulation of unique subsets of genes. In closing, this series of studies has revealed that the biological activities of xenoestrogens through ERα and ERβ are mediated in a promoter-specific manner and that estrogen-responsive promoters communicate differently with ERα and ERβ by regulating their structures in a distinct manner that leads to diversity in their relative transcriptional responses. These findings may also suggest a need to reevaluate the current cell-based assays for endocrine-disrupting chemicals through the ERs to include assessments of xenoestrogen transcriptional activity on different physiological estrogen-responsive gene promoters, which might be more predictive ofin vivo activity.

https://openalex.org/W1990155055,"Among the various applications for reversible holographic storage media, a particularly interesting one is time-gated holographic imaging (TGHI). This technique could provide a noninvasive medical diagnosis tool, related to optical coherence tomography. In this technique, biological samples are illuminated within their transparency window with near-infrared light, and information about subsurface features is obtained by a detection method that distinguishes between reflected photons originating from a certain depth and those scattered from various depths. Such an application requires reversible holographic storage media with very high sensitivity in the near-infrared. Photorefractive materials, in particular certain amorphous organic systems, are in principle promising candidate media, but their sensitivity has so far been too low, mainly owing to their long response times in the near-infrared. Here we introduce an organic photorefractive material -- a composite based on the poly(arylene vinylene) copolymer TPD-PPV -- that exhibits favourable near-infrared characteristics. We show that pre-illumination of this material at a shorter wavelength before holographic recording improves the response time by a factor of 40. This process was found to be reversible. We demonstrate multiple holographic recording with this technique at video rate under practical conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2089952244,"Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the amino-terminal region of huntingtin. Mutant huntingtin is proteolytically cleaved by caspases, generating amino-terminal aggregates that are toxic for cells. The addition of calpains to total brain homogenates also leads to cleavage of wild-type huntingtin, indicating that proteolysis of mutant and wild-type huntingtin may play a role in HD. Here we report that endogenous wild-type huntingtin is promptly cleaved by calpains in primary neurons. Exposure of primary neurons to glutamate or 3-nitropropionic acid increases intracellular calcium concentration, leading to loss of intact full-length wild-type huntingtin. This cleavage could be prevented by calcium chelators and calpain inhibitors. Degradation of wild-type huntingtin by calcium-dependent proteases thus occurs in HD neurons, leading to loss of wild-type huntingtin neuroprotective activity."

Science. 1992; 258: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). PKC represents a family of 11 isozymes that have been categorized into three groups: group A or conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ), group B or novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, and θ), and group C or atypical PKCs (ζ and λ/ι) (2Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 3Basu A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 257-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). In addition, PKCμ resembles novel PKCs structurally but resembles atypical PKCs functionally (5Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas conventional PKCs require Ca2+ and diacylglycerol/phorbol esters for their activities, novel PKCs and atypical PKCs are Ca2+-independent. Atypical PKCs are also insensitive to diacylglycerol and phorbol esters. In the native conformation, the regulatory domain of PKC interacts with the catalytic domain through pseudosubstrate sequences and prevents access of substrates to the catalytic site (3Basu A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 257-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The binding of cofactors, such as phosphatidylserine, Ca2+, and diacylglycerol/phorbol esters, to the regulatory domain induces a conformational change in the enzyme, thereby exposing the substrate-binding site, and catalysis takes place. The proteolytic cleavage of PKC at the hinge region can also separate the regulatory domain from the catalytic domain. The catalytic fragment (PKM) thus generated does not require any activators or cofactors for activation. In the case of conventional PKCs, proteolytic activation can be achieved by Ca2+-activated proteases, calpains. It has been shown that novel PKC isozymes, including PKCδ, -θ, and -μ, are substrates for caspases (6Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R.

Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). All caspases exist as inactive proenzymes, which are proteolytically processed to the active heterodimeric form. To date, 14 caspases have been identified. Whereas caspase-8, -9, and -10 participate in the initiation phase of apoptosis, caspase-3, -6, and -7 are involved in the execution phase of apoptosis (10Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Activation of these executioner caspases results in the cleavage of critical cellular proteins, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), DNA-dependent protein kinase, and lamin B. Cleavage of novel PKC isozymes by caspases also generates catalytically active carboxyl-terminal fragments. Proteolytic activation of these novel PKC isozymes has been directly associated with cell death (6Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R.

Little is known about the regulation of PKCε activity by caspases and the functional significance of caspase-mediated processing of PKCε on cell death. In the present study, we report for the first time that PKCε is cleaved by caspase-7, proteolytic cleavage of PKCε by TNF results in its activation, and inhibition of PKCε activity abrogates its antiapoptotic activity. TNF was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and cell-permeable caspase inhibitors were obtained from Kamiya Biomedical Co. (Seattle, WA). Calpeptin was fromCalbiochem-Novabiochem. Annexin V conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 and PI were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Human recombinant caspase-7 and -8 and monoclonal antibody to PARP were from Pharmingen. Human recombinant caspase-2, -3, -6, and -9 and caspase substrates were from BioVision (Palo Alto, CA). MBP was purchased from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory Inc. (West Grove, PA). Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Millipore, and enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit was from Amersham Biosciences. MCF-7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine and kept in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol and selected using Geneticin (Invitrogen). Full-length PKCε was cloned from human muscle cDNA library by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3. Caspase cleavage sites were mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the manufacturer's protocol. Dominant-negative PKCε was generated by mutation of Lys437 to Arg (K437R). Sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. [35S]Met-labeled wild-type and mutant PKCε were synthesized by in vitro coupled transcription and translation with the T7 Quick TnT kit (Promega). Labeled proteins were incubated with human recombinant caspases in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 1 h. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography was performed with the dried gel. Equivalent amounts of total cellular extracts were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (11Basu A. Akkaraju G.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4245-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with or without TNF as indicated in the text. PKCε was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antibody to PKCε, and immunokinase assay was performed as described previously (20Basu A. Woolard M.D. Johnson C.L. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) using MBP as the substrate in the absence of any cofactors. The reaction mixture was separated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography was performed with the dried gel. Cells were treated with or without TNF for 12 h. At the end of the incubation, both detached cells and attached cells were collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then stained with annexin V-Alexa 488 conjugate and propidium iodide according to the manufacturer's protocol and analyzed using a flow cytometer (Coulter Epics). We have previously shown that both DNA-damaging agents and TNF could induce cleavage of PKCε (11Basu A. Akkaraju G.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4245-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 19Basu A. Mohanty S. Sun B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To examine whether proteolytic activation of PKCε is mediated by caspases, we examined the effects of several cell-permeable caspase inhibitors on TNF-induced processing of PKCε. Fig. 1 shows that treatment of MCF-7 cells with TNF resulted in a decrease in full-length PKCε with a concomitant increase in a fragment with an approximate molecular mass of 43 kDa. Because binding of TNF to its receptors induces activation of apical caspase-8, we examined the effect of z-IETD-fmk, a cell-permeable inhibitor of caspase-8, on TNF-induced processing of PKCε. As shown in Fig. 1, caspase-8 inhibitor blocked TNF-induced cleavage of PKCε. z-DEVD-fmk, an inhibitor of caspase-3 and -7, was as effective as z-IETD-fmk in preventing TNF-induced processing of PKCε, whereas z-LEHD-fmk, an inhibitor of caspase-9, exhibited a partial inhibition. In contrast, calpeptin, a cell-permeable inhibitor of calpains, had little effect on the proteolytic cleavage of PKCε, even at 50 μmconcentrations (data not shown). These results suggest that TNF-induced activation of caspases results in the processing of PKCε. To determine whether PKCε is in fact a substrate for caspases, we examined the effect of human recombinant caspases on the cleavage of 35S-labeled in vitro-translated PKCε. Fig. 2 shows that PKCε was cleaved by caspase-3, -7, and -9. Human recombinant caspase-8 had only a slight effect, but caspase-2 and -6 were unable to process PKCε (data not shown). Cleavage of PKCε by human recombinant caspases generated fragments with apparent molecular masses of 52, 43, and 35 kDa. Caspase inhibitors z-DEVD-fmk and z-LEHD-fmk were able to inhibit processing of PKCε by caspase-3/-7 and caspase-9, respectively (Fig.2). The cleavage pattern of PKCε generated by caspase-3, -7, and -9 was similar, suggesting that there may be overlapping specificity in anin vitro cleavage assay. However, the 52-kDa band was not detectable in the caspase-7-treated lane, presumably because it was further cleaved to 43-kDa and 9-kDa fragments. Because caspase-7 was most effective in processing PKCε, we examined the time course of PKCε cleavage by caspase-7. As shown in Fig.3, significant processing of PKCε took place by 30 min, and little full-length PKCε remained after incubation of PKCε with caspase-7 for 2 h.Figure 3Time course of processing of in vitro-translated PKC ε by human recombinant caspase-7.[35S]Met-labeled in vitro-translated PKCε was treated with human recombinant caspase-7 at 37 °C for the indicated periods of time and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

As shown in Fig.4, the intensity of the band near 43 kDa produced by the treatment of in vitro-translated PKCε with caspase-7 was much greater compared with that of the 52- and 35-kDa fragments. Mutation at the DDVD↓C (D451A) site abolished cleavage of PKCε to 52- and 35-kDa fragments, whereas mutation at the SSPD↓G (D383A) site prevented generation of fragments near 43 kDa. Cleavage of PKCε at the SSPD↓G site presumably produced two fragments of identical molecular mass around 43 kDa. During the TnT assay, sometimes we could detect some faint bands, including one near the 43-kDa region, even without any caspase treatment. This protein results from tRNA-dependent, ribosome-independent addition of [35S]methionine on proteins (21Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The important point is that the intensity of the 43-kDa band was similar in control and caspase-treated D383A mutant PKCε. Thus, it was not generated by the cleavage of PKCε by caspases. To determine the cleavage pattern of PKCε generated by TNF in intact cells, we overexpressed PKCε in MCF-7 cells and treated them with TNF for varying periods of time. We have used an antibody that recognizes the carboxyl-terminal domain of PKCε. Fig.5 shows that a 6-h exposure to TNF resulted in the generation of a fragment near 43 kDa and that the intensity of the 43-kDa band increased with time. Another band appeared above the 43-kDa fragment after treatment with TNF. The intensity of the band was maximum at 12 h and then rapidly decreased. This band likely represents a phosphorylated form of the 43-kDa fragment because mutation of Asp to Ala of nearby LSFD↓N (D370A) and LGLD↓E (D406A) sites did not prevent caspase-mediated processing of PKCε (data not shown). TNF also induced cleavage of PKCε to a 35-kDa fragment, and the intensity of the 35-kDa band increased when cells were treated with TNF for >12 h. In addition, the intensity of the 35-kDa fragment was much less compared with that of the 43-kDa fragment. A faint band with an approximate molecular mass of 50 kDa was also apparent after treatment of the cells with TNF for 24 h. This could represent the carboxyl-terminal fragment of PKCε processed by caspase-9 (Fig. 2). Thus, PKCε was cleaved primarily at the SSPD↓G site in intact cells in response to TNF. To determine whether mutation of PKCε at the DDVD↓C (D451A) or the SSPD↓G (D383A) site blocks corresponding cleavage of PKCε in intact cells, we introduced PKCε harboring a mutation at the D451A or D383A site in MCF-7 cells. As shown in Fig.6, the intensity of the 43-kDa band increased dramatically after treatment of PKCε-overexpressing MCF-7 cells with TNF. TNF also induced cleavage of PKCε to 43-kDa fragments in cells expressing the D451A mutant, but mutation at the D383A site prevented TNF-induced processing of PKCε to 43-kDa fragments. These results corroborate that PKCε is processed primarily at the SSPD↓G (D383A) site in intact cells. The same blot was probed with tubulin to control for loading differences. To determine whether TNF-induced processing of PKCε results in the activation of PKCε, we performed immunokinase assay using MBP as the substrate. As depicted in Fig. 7, proteolytic separation of the autoinhibitory regulatory domain from the catalytic domain is expected to result in the activation of PKCε in the absence of any cofactors. Fig. 8 Ashows that TNF caused a slight increase in MBP phosphorylation in vector-transfected MCF-7 cells. In contrast, MBP phosphorylation was almost undetectable in cells expressing DN-PKCε, even when cells were treated with TNF. TNF had a dramatic effect on MBP phosphorylation in PKCε-overexpressing cells (Fig. 8 B). We have used twice as much protein during immunoprecipitation of PKCε from vector-transfected and DN-PKCε-expressing cells (Fig. 8 A) compared with PKCε-overexpressing cells (Fig. 8 B) to allow detection of PKCε activation in vector-transfected cells and to permit comparison between vector-transfected cells and DN-PKCε-expressing cells.Figure 8Effect of TNF treatment on the activation of PKCε.MCF-7 cells transfected with an empty vector, wild-type PKCε, or dominant-negative PKCε were treated with 1 nmTNF for the indicated periods of time. PKCε was immunoprecipitated, and an immunokinase assay was performed using MBP as the substrate in the absence of any cofactors. We have used twice as much protein during immunoprecipitation in A (500 μg) as compared withB (250 μg). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography was performed with the dried gel. Equal amounts of total cellular extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis with PKCε antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the SSPD↓G site is localized at the hinge region of PKCε (Fig. 7), we examined whether processing at the SSPD↓G site was necessary for TNF-induced activation of PKCε. We compared the ability of TNF to activate PKCε in cells expressing wild-type or mutant PKCε using an immunokinase assay. Fig. 9 shows that mutation at the D451A site that retains the ability of TNF to generate the 43-kDa catalytic fragment of PKCε was not sufficient to prevent activation of PKCε by TNF. In contrast, mutation at the D383A site that prevents generation of the 43-kDa fragment abolished TNF-induced activation of PKCε. Thus, processing of PKCε by TNF at the D383A site results in its activation. We have previously shown that PKC activators protect cells against TNF-induced cytotoxicity (22Basu A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig.10 shows that when cells transfected with a vector containing neomycin resistance gene but without PKCε construct (Fig. 10, Neo) were treated with TNF, cells rounded up and detached from the tissue culture dish. Overexpression of PKCε prevented the morphological changes indicative of apoptosis when cells were treated with TNF for 12 h, although cells started to round up after exposure to TNF for 18 h. Introduction of either D383A mutant or DN-PKCε failed to prevent cell death by TNF, suggesting that activation of PKCε was necessary for the antiapoptotic activity of PKCε. To quantify cell death by apoptosis, we performed an annexin V binding assay (Fig. 11). When cells undergo apoptosis, phosphatidylserine is flipped from the inner to the outer leaflet of plasma membrane. During an early stage of apoptosis, annexin V binds to phosphatidylserine on the cell surface. Cells were co-stained with the cell-impermeable dye PI to distinguish apoptotic cells from necrotic cells. However, during late-stage apoptosis, annexin V can enter through the membrane, and therefore late-stage apoptosis cannot be distinguished from necrosis. Fig. 11 shows a representative dot blot analysis of annexin V conjugate-PI-stained cells. Cells stained with annexin V conjugate alone (bottom right quadrant) represent apoptotic cells, whereas cells co-stained with annexin V conjugate and PI (top right quadrant) represent late apoptotic and necrotic cells. Viable cells are shown at the bottom left quadrant (negative for both annexin V and PI). We have shown the mean ± S.E. of total percentage of cell death from two to three independent experiments at the top of each panel. A small percentage of cells undergo apoptosis even in the absence of any TNF treatment. TNF increased cell death to ∼15% in vector-transfected MCF-7 cells (Neo), but the effect of TNF was attenuated in cells overexpressing PKCε such that ∼5% cells underwent apoptosis. In contrast, introduction of mutant PKCε (D383A) caused an increase in apoptotic cell death to 25%. At present, it is not clear why blockage of PKCε cleavage not only inhibited the antiapoptotic effect of PKCε but also potentiated cell death by TNF. Overexpression of dominant-negative PKCε by itself increased cell death to ∼8%, and TNF further enhanced cell death to 16%. We have consistently found that when DN-PKCε-expressing cells are cultured for several passages, their ability to potentiate TNF-induced cell death decreases, presumably because cells that are resistant to apoptosis survive selectively over cells that are prone to apoptosis. Because MCF-7 cells lack functional caspase-3, they do not undergo DNA fragmentation (23Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also assessed cleavage of PARP or DNA-dependent protein kinase to monitor cells undergoing apoptosis. Fig. 12 shows that treatment of MCF-7 cells with TNF resulted in the cleavage of PARP, as evidenced by the appearance of the 85-kDa cleavage product of 116-kDa full-length PARP. Although PKCδ is cleaved during apoptosis, TNF had no effect on the processing of PKCδ in MCF-7 cells, which lack caspase-3. Overexpression of PKCε in MCF-7 cells prevented TNF-induced cleavage of PARP and DNA-dependent protein kinase. By contrast, introduction of D383A mutant PKCε in MCF-7 cells failed to prevent TNF-induced cleavage of PARP. These results suggest that activation of PKCε inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis. Protein kinase C plays an important role in regulating cell survival and cell death. Different PKC isozymes may exhibit distinct functions in cell death regulation. Proteolytic activation of novel PKCδ and -θ has been shown to be important for the induction of apoptosis (6Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W.

Results of our present study demonstrate that PKCε was also cleaved by caspases during apoptosis, but proteolytic cleavage of PKCε prevented its antiapoptotic signal. Several novel PKC isozymes, including PKCδ, -θ, and -μ, have been identified as substrates for caspase-3 (6Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W.

Although PKCε serves as a substrate for caspase-3 in an in vitro cleavage assay, it is processed in MCF-7 cells lacking functional caspase-3, suggesting that some caspase other than caspase-3 is responsible for the cleavage of PKCε. Caspase-3 and -7 share similar substrate specificities: they both recognize DEVD sequence and cleave PARP (24Garcia-Calvo M. Pertson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 25Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D.

However, PKCδ is not processed by apoptotic stimuli in MCF-7 cells, suggesting that there may be some specificity in intact cells (19Basu A. Mohanty S. Sun B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because both caspase-3 and -7 generated similar cleavage products, it is likely that caspase-7 is responsible for the cleavage of PKCε in MCF-7 cells. Human recombinant caspase-9 also generated cleavage products similar to those of caspase-3 and -7, in addition to two faint bands with approximate molecular masses of 50 and 38 kDa. Thus, caspase-9 may cleave PKCε at an additional site, and there may be overlapping specificity in an in vitro cleavage assay. It has been shown that PKCζ is processed at the same site by several caspases, including caspase-8, -3, -6, and -7 (13Smith L. Chen L. Reyland M.E. DeVries T.A. Talanian R.V. Omura S. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40620-40627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PKCε contains a DDVD↓C site that is recognized by group II caspases, including caspase-3, -7, and -2 (27Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M.

Both caspase-3 and –7, but not caspase-2, cleaved PKCε at the DDVD↓C site, although it was predominantly processed at the SSPD↓G site both in vitro and in intact cells. Because a cell-permeable inhibitor of caspase-3/-7 was more effective than the inhibitor of caspase-9 in preventing generation of the 43-kDa fragment, it is likely that caspase-7 also cleaves PKCε at the SSPD↓G site. This site was recognized irrespective of the cell type or apoptotic stimuli. For example, TNF induced processing of PKCε to 43-kDa fragments in several breast cancer cells (19Basu A. Mohanty S. Sun B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, treatment of HeLa cells with cisplatin, a DNA-damaging agent, also cleaved PKCε to generate a 43-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment (11Basu A. Akkaraju G.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4245-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Whereas caspase-3 recognized conventional caspase cleavage sites in PKCδ and -θ, it cleaved PKCμ at an unconventional CQND↓S site, even though PKCμ possessed DDND↓S and DHED↓S sites that could be recognized by caspase-3-like proteases (6Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 7Datta R.

Johannes F.-J. Kufe D. Datta R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18476-18481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). PKCζ was also cleaved primarily at an unconventional EETD↓G site by several caspases, whereas caspase-3 and -7 processed PKCζ at a conventional DGMD↓G site (13Smith L. Chen L. Reyland M.E. DeVries T.A. Talanian R.V. Omura S. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40620-40627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the hinge region of PKCs is more accessible to caspases. However, mutation or cleavage of the SSPD↓G site at the hinge region may expose other caspase cleavage sites. This may explain why cleavage of PKCε by caspase-7 was more pronounced in the D383A mutant compared with wild-type PKCε (Fig. 4). The primary cleavage site for all of the PKC isozymes was at the hinge region between the regulatory domain and the catalytic domain. Because the pseudosubstrate sequence at the regulatory domain interacts with the catalytic domain, caspase-mediated cleavage of PKCs separates the catalytic fragment from the autoinhibitory regulatory domain, resulting in activation of PKCs. Thus, in response to apoptotic stimuli, PKCs may be activated in the absence of any cofactors. Cleavage of PKCε by caspases at the hinge region (Ser-Ser-Pro-Asp383-Gly) would generate a carboxyl-terminal fragment containing the catalytic domain. In contrast, cleavage of PKCε at the Asp-Asp-Val-Asp451-Cys site would generate a carboxyl-terminal fragment lacking the ATP binding site. We have shown that treatment of MCF-7 cells with TNF results in PKCε activation and that mutation at the D383A site prevents TNF-induced activation of PKCε. In contrast, mutation at the D451A site did not affect TNF-induced activation of PKCε. Therefore, caspase-mediated processing of PKCε at the Ser-Ser-Pro-Asp383-Gly site results in its activation. PKC activators have been shown to block TNF-induced cell death. In the present study, we have shown that overexpression of PKCε in MCF-7 cells inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis, suggesting that PKCε acts as an antiapoptotic protein. This is consistent with our previous report that overexpression of PKCε in rat embryo fibroblasts delayed apoptosis induced by the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin (17Basu A. Cline J.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have also examined the functional significance of PKCε activation on TNF-induced cell death. In contrast to wild-type PKCε, introduction of DN-PKCε in MCF-7 cells by itself caused some cell death and failed to inhibit TNF-induced apoptosis. Blockage of the caspase cleavage site (D383A) of PKCε prevented antiapoptotic activity of PKCε, suggesting that activation of PKCε was necessary for the antiapoptotic function of PKCε. Thus, our results provide a direct link between activation of PKCε and its antiapoptotic function. We thank Maria Chahrour for critical reading of the manuscript."

In animals, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases are a major type of kinase that decode calcium signals. In plants and protists, calcium-dependent protein kinases contain a kinase catalytic domain fused with a calmodulin-like regulatory domain and are directly activated by cytosolic calcium (1Roberts D.M.

The Arabidopsis genome contains a large number of protein kinase genes (3Arabidopsis Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7164) Google Scholar). We have recently identified a novel family of 24 salt overly sensitive 2 (SOS2)1-like protein kinase genes (designated PKSes) fromArabidopsis (4Liu J. Ishitani M. Halfter U. Kim C.-S. Zhu J.-K. Proc.

Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The biochemical characteristics andin vivo roles of most of these kinases are still unknown at the present time. These PKSes are Ser/Thr protein kinases that comprise an N-terminal kinase catalytic domain similar to SNF1/AMPK and a unique C-terminal regulatory domain (4Liu J. Ishitani M. Halfter U. Kim C.-S.

Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The PKS kinases can be classified into the SnRK3 subgroup of plant SNF1-related protein kinases (6Kreis M. Walker J.C. Plant Protein Kinases. Academic Press, San Diego2000: 1-44Google Scholar). The founding member, SOS2, is known to function in salt tolerance in plants (4Liu J. Ishitani M. Halfter U. Kim C.-S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). We have also defined a novel family of SOS3-like EF-hand-type calcium sensors that may sense the calcium signal elicited by salt stress and other stimuli (5Guo Y. Halfer U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 7Liu J. Zhu J.-K. Science. 1998; 280: 1943-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 8Ishitani M. Liu J. Halfter U.

SOS3 interacts with and activates SOS2 via the autoinhibitory FISL motif within the regulatory domain of SOS2 (5Guo Y. Halfer U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K.

An up-regulation of the putative plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporterSOS1 gene by salt stress is partially controlled viaSOS2 and SOS3 (10Shi H. Ishitani M. Kim C.-S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6896-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Recently, both SOS3 and SOS2 have been shown to be required for the activation of Na+/H+ exchange activity of SOS1 (11Qiu Q.-S. Guo Y. Dietrich M.A. Schumaker K.S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8436-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Most PKS proteins, including PKS18, when expressed and isolated from bacteria, do not seem to exhibit substrate phosphorylation activity in the absence of specific SOS3-like calcium sensors. To determine the biochemical characteristics and in vivo roles of the novel kinases, we wanted to create constitutively active forms of these proteins. Here we isolated and characterized a novel Arabidopsis PKS gene, PKS18. PKS18 was expressed in leaves of mature plants. Substitution of a threonine residue with aspartic acid within the activation loop resulted in a highly activated PKS18 mutant (designated PKS18T/D), suggesting an important role of the activation loop phosphorylation in the regulation of PKS18 activity. This constitutively active PKS18 mutant was then utilized to determine cofactor preference, pH dependence, substrate specificity, and kinetic properties of the kinase in vitro. To investigate thein vivo function of PKS18, we generated transgenicArabidopsis plants ectopically expressing thePKS18T/D or dominant negative mutant by RNA interference (RNAi). PKS18T/D transgenic plants were hypersensitive to the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) in seed germination and seedling growth, whereas silencing the kinase gene via RNAi conferred ABA-insensitivity. Seeds of the Arabidopsiswild type plants (Columbia ecotype) were germinated, and seedlings were grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) (12Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53958) Google Scholar) agar plates under continuous light (13Wu S. Ding L. Zhu J-K. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 617-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ten-day-old seedlings were treated with NaCl, cold, and drought as described previously (10Shi H. Ishitani M. Kim C.-S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Total RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis were performed as described previously (15Zhu J.-K. Liu J. Xiong L. Plant Cell. 1998; 8: 1181-1191Crossref Scopus (551) Google Scholar). To analyze transgene expression, total RNA was isolated from 2-week-old seedlings grown on MS agar plates containing 0.3 μm ABA. Thirty micrograms of total RNA were used, and the blot was hybridized with a PKS18 gene-specific DNA probe. A cDNA containing the complete open reading frame (ORF) of PKS18 was obtained by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The PKS18-specific primers were 5′-CGGGATCCATGGATAAAAACGGCATAGTTTTGATGC-3′ (forward,BamHI site underlined) and 5′-GCGGTACCTTAATGTATCACTTCAATCTTCTCATTG-3′ (reverse,KpnI site underlined) (MWG-Biotech, High Point, NC). The PCR product was purified from the agarose gel, digested withBamHI and KpnI, and cloned into a modified pGEX-2T-CMS vector and sequenced from both strands. For analysis of thePKS18 gene expression in wild type plants and RNAi lines, the first strand cDNAs were synthesized from total RNA samples of wild type, pks18-1, pks18-3, pks18-5, and pks18-8RNAi plants. RT-PCR was performed by using the PKS18gene-specific primers as described above. PKS6 andPKS11 gene-specific primers were used in the control PCR reactions. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct Thr to Asp changes or a FISL motif deletion mutant of PKS18 (designated PKS18FD). The mutagenic primers were as follows: 5′-CAAGATGGCTTGCTTCACGACACATGTGGAACACCTGC-3′ (pPKS18T/D-forward), 5′-AAGCAGGTGTTCCACATGTGTCGTGAAGCAAGCCATCTTG-3′ (pPKS18T/D-reverse), 5′-ACCGATGTCTAAAGAAGAGAGATCAGAATCGAAGTTTAC-3′ (pPKS18FD-forward), and 5′-TCTCTTCTTTAGACATCGGTTTTACGGAAAAAGCTGCGTG-3′ (pPKS18FD-reverse). PCR reactions were carried out on the plasmid DNAs with an enzyme mix (1:1) of LA Tag (Takara Shuzo Ltd., Kyoto) and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The gel-purified PCR products were digested with DpnI and transformed into DH5α competent cells. The mutated sequences and fidelity of the rest of the DNA in these constructs were verified by sequencing. All GST fusion constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 codon plus cells (Stratagene). The transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml) until the OD600 reached 0.8. Recombinant protein expression was induced by 0.6 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in a phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. GST fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), and analyzed by 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gels. Peptide phosphorylation with a synthetic peptide p3 (ALARAASAAALARRR, Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) was assayed as the incorporation of radioactivity from [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Foster City, CA) into the peptide substrate. Kinase assay buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 2.5 mm MnCl2or 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 10 μm ATP, and 2 mmdithiothreitol. Forty microliters of kinase reaction were started by adding 150 μm p3 and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of 600 cpm/pmol), and reaction mixtures were immediately incubated at 30 °C with gentle shaking for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 1 μl of 0.5m EDTA, and the glutathione-Sepharose beads were pelleted. To measure peptide phosphorylation, 15 μl of the supernatant was spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman, Clifton, NJ). The P-81 paper was washed with phosphoric acid (1%, v/v), and the phosphorylated peptide was quantified by phosphoimaging using a PhosphorImager STORM 860 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To detect autophosphorylation, the remaining reaction mixture was separated by 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed to a Kodak x-ray film. For determination of the divalent cation requirement, kinase assays were performed in the kinase buffer with 0–20 mm of MnCl2 or MgCl2, while the concentrations of p3 (150 μm) and ATP (10 μm) were fixed. To determine the effect of pH on substrate phosphorylation activity, 20 mm BIS-TRIS propane titrated to the desired pH was used in place of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer. Peptides p1 (LRRASLG) and p2 (VRKRTLRRL) (Sigma) were also used to test the substrate specificity. Individual kinetic parameters were determined by varying the concentrations of p3 (0–300 μm) while holding ATP constant (10 μm). Alternatively, ATP concentrations were varied (0–30 μm) while keeping p3 constant (150 μm). To generate the overexpression construct of thePKS18T/D coding region, a PCR reaction was carried out using the primer sets 5′-GGGGTACCATGGATAAAAACGGCATAGTTTTGATGC-3′ (forward,KpnI site underlined) and 5′-CGAGCTCTTAATGTATCACTTCAATCTTCTCATTG-3′ (reverse,SstI site underlined) on the PKS18T/DcDNA template. The PCR product was purified from agarose gel, digested, and cloned into the binary vector, pBIB, under control of the superpromoter (16Narasimhulu S.B. Deng X. Sarria R. Gelvin S.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 873-886PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter is located upstream of thePKS18T/D coding region. To construct RNAi transgenic lines of PKS18, a gene-specific cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR using the following primer pair: 5′-CGGGATCCATTTAAATGAAGGCCTAAGCTCACGATCAC-3′ (forward,BamHI and SwaI sites underlined) and 5′-GGACTAGTGGCGCGCCTAAATCTCCCGAAAGTC-3′ (reverse,SpeI and AscI sites underlined). The cDNA fragment was first cloned into the pFGC1008 vector (ag.arizona.edu/chromatin/fgc1008.html) between the SwaI and AscI sites in the antisense orientation. The sense fragment was then inserted between the BamHI andSpeI sites. These constructs were introduced intoAgrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 and transformed intoArabidopsis wild type (Columbia ecotype) plants by floral infiltration (17Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dry seeds were planted on MS agar media containing hygromycin (40 mg/liter) and vancomycin (500 mg/liter), and the transgenic lines were selected. The transformed seedlings were transferred into soil to set seeds under normal growth conditions. Sterile seeds were then planted on MS agar plates, and the seeds were germinated and grown on the vertical plates at 22 °C and 16-hr light and 8-hr dark photoperiod. Seed germination and seedling growth of the wild type, T2 and T3 generation transgenic lines were tested on MS media for responses to various concentrations of ABA, NaCl, mannitol, sucrose, glucose, and different pH treatments. To observe ABA dose response, seeds of the transgenic and control lines were germinated and seedlings grown on MS plates containing 0, 0.15, 0.3, and 0.45 μm ABA. The kinetic parameters were calculated by nonlinear least squares analysis of the averaged initial velocity data fitting to the Henri-Michaelis-Menten equation:V 0 = V max A/(K m + A). In this equation,V 0 is the measured initial velocity;V max is the maximum velocity; A is the substrate concentration; and K m is the apparent Michaelis constant. The k cat values were calculated by dividing V max by the total enzyme concentration. A cDNA containing the ORF of PKS18 was amplified by RT-PCR and completely sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence ofPKS18 was identical to the computer annotation in the data base. The PKS18 cDNA contains an ORF of 1320 bp and encodes a polypeptide of 440 amino acid residues with an estimated molecular mass of 50.2 kDa. The PKS18 gene is located on chromosome 5 based on the Arabidopsis genomic sequence data base (www.arabidopsis.org). Blots of total RNA from different tissues of adult Arabidopsis plants were hybridized to a gene-specific DNA probe for PKS18. PKS18 was expressed in leaves of adult plants, but its expression was not detectable in any of the other tissues examined (Fig.1). We also tested potential regulation of the PKS gene by salt, cold, and drought in youngArabidopsis seedlings. PKS18 mRNA accumulation was not significantly affected by any of the treatments (data not shown). The GST-PKS18 fusion protein in which the bacterial GST was fused in-frame to the N-terminal end of PKS18, had little kinase activity when expressed and isolated from bacteria (data not shown). To determine its biochemical characteristics, we attempted to construct constitutively active forms of the kinase. We have recently found that SOS2 could be activated either by a Thr to Asp mutation in the putative activation loop or deletion of the regulatory domain (5Guo Y. Halfer U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Like SOS2, PKS18 contained an N-terminal SNF1-like kinase catalytic domain and a novel C-terminal regulatory domain (Fig.2 A). The deduced amino acid sequences of PKS18 and SOS2 were highly conserved throughout the entire length. Interestingly, PKS18 also contained a conserved putative activation loop in the catalytic domain and a FISL motif in the regulatory domain (Fig. 2 B). A residue, Thr169, in the activation loop of PKS18 is conserved (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). We hypothesized that the threonine residue could be one critical target site for activation by a putative upstream kinase(s). We therefore substituted the residue with aspartic acid by site-directed mutagenesis to construct an activation loop mutant of PKS18 (PKS18T/D). A FISL motif deletion mutant (PKS18FD) was also produced by removing the FISL motif between Tyr295 and Glu316. We expressed and purified the PKS18T/D and PKS18FD mutant proteins as well as the wild type protein (designated PKS18WT) from bacteria. SDS-PAGE analysis of these purified proteins showed a single band of ∼80 kDa in agreement with the calculated mass (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig. 3 B, both mutant proteins exhibited higher autophosphorylation activity compared with PKS18WT. SOS2 is known to phosphorylate a synthetic peptide p3 (AMARAASAAALARRR) in the presence of SOS3 (9Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). With the p3 as a substrate, PKS18T/D mutant was extremely active, with a 113-fold higher activity in p3 phosphorylation than PKS18WT (Fig. 3 C). PKS18FD also displayed a 2-fold increase in p3 phosphorylation compared with PKS18WT (Fig. 3 C). We subsequently used the active form of PKS18, PKS18T/D, to analyze some of the biochemical properties of this kinase. A divalent cation is required by kinases and other phosphotransferases for coordinating the phosphate groups of the nucleotide triphosphate substrate. These enzymes may also be activated or inactivated by binding of a cation to an additional site of interaction (18Sun G. Budde R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2139-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Both autophosphorylation and peptide substrate phosphorylation activities of PKS18T/D required the divalent cation Mg2+ or Mn2+ as a cofactor (Fig. 4,A and B). Interestingly, this kinase seemed to prefer Mn2+ to Mg2+ as a cofactor for either autophosphorylation or peptide phosphorylation. Mg2+ only weakly activated the kinase, and the activation required millimolar concentrations of Mg2+, but Mn2+ activated the kinase even in the micromolar range. The optimal concentrations were at ∼2.5 mm for Mn2+ and 5 mm for Mg2+. Mn2+ concentration at 5 mm or higher became inhibitory to peptide phosphorylation activity of the kinase. In contrast, Mg2+ concentration up to 20 mm did not inhibit the phosphorylation activity of the kinase (Fig. 4, A and B). P3 phosphorylation by the kinase was determined over the pH range of 6.5–9.5 (Fig. 5 A). The optimal pH for the kinase was observed to be ∼7.5, and this kinase seemed to be tolerant of slightly alkaline pH. In addition to p3, another serine-containing peptide p1 (LRRASLG) and a threonine-containing peptide p2 (VRKRTLRRL) could also be phosphorylated by SOS2 (9Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Kinase assays with these three peptides showed that PKS18T/D did phosphorylate both p1 and p3, with p3 giving higher activity than p1, but it did not have any significant activity with p2 (Fig. 5 B). To further evaluate its affinity toward the preferred peptide substrate p3 and ATP, we conducted a kinetic study for the kinase. The dependence of kinase activity of PKS18T/D on either p3 or ATP exhibited a typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig.6, A and B). The apparent K m values of PKS18T/D for p3 and ATP were determined to be 29 and 0.88 μm, respectively (data not shown). The ratio of k cat toK m is a good overall measure of substrate preference. The k cat/K mvalues of PKS18T/D for p1 and p3 were 0.76 and 2.2m−1 s−1, respectively (data not shown), indicating a preference of p3 over p1. In addition, the activity of PKS18T/D was slightly inhibited by high concentrations of ATP. At 25–100 μm concentrations of ATP, the activity was reduced by ∼5% compared with the peak activity at 10 μm ATP. At 1 mm ATP, the kinase still had ∼75% of the peak activity (data not shown).Figure 6Dependence of substrate phosphorylation of PKS18T/D on peptide substrate p3 and ATP. A, p3 dependence. ATP concentration in the kinase assay buffer was set constant at 10 μm. B, ATP dependence. P3 concentration in the kinase assay buffer was set constant at 150 μm. Phosphorylation of p3 by PKS18T/D was assayed at 30 °C in the presence of 2.5 mm MnCl2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results shown are the averages of three independent assays presented as saturation curves with specific activity versus p3 or ATP concentration as indicated. Theinsets are Eadie-Hosftee plots of the average values for each data set. Error bars indicate ± S.D. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) SOS2 kinase is known to function in plant salt tolerance (4Liu J. Ishitani M. Halfter U. Kim C.-S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). To attribute in planta functions to PKS18, we used both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches. The coding region of the PKS18T/D was fused to the superpromoter and used to transform Arabidopsis plants. Over 20 T2 and T3 homozygous lines were recovered, and lines with high transgene expression levels were selected for more detailed analyses. The expression levels of the kinase gene in thePKS18T/D transgenic plants were determined by Northern blot analysis using a gene-specific probe. The results (Fig.7 A) showed that all the transgenic lines tested (at 0.3 μm ABA) expressed the transgene at various levels. In contrast, there was littlePKS18 transcript expression in wild type seedlings under the same conditions. We tested the transgenic lines under various treatment conditions such as ABA, salt stress, high mannitol, sucrose or glucose, and extreme pHs. We found that the lines had a clear phenotypic change under ABA but not other treatments. To evaluate the effect ofPKS18T/D overexpression on the ABA sensitivity in transgenic plants, seeds of the PKS18T/Dtransgenic plants were germinated and seedlings were grown on MS media containing various concentrations of ABA. When ABA concentration was 0.3 μm or higher, both seed germination and seedling growth including root growth and cotyledon greening/expansion were severely inhibited (Fig. 8 Aand data not shown). In contrast, seeds of the nontransformed wild type plants germinated and seedlings grew normally, although at a slower rate than on ABA-free MS media. Quantitation of seed germination (Fig.8 B) showed that percentage of seedlings with green cotyledons in two transgenic lines, PKS18T/D-1 andPKS18T/D-9, were only 8 and 4%, respectively, at 0.3 μm ABA, whereas the percentage in wild type plants was 55% under the same conditions. Measurement of root length showed that root growth of these two transgenic lines on 0.3 μm ABA medium was less than 20% of that on ABA-free medium (Fig.8 C). In contrast, root growth of wild type plants was ∼70% of that on ABA-free medium. In a dose response assay, root growth of the transgenic seedlings was found to be hypersensitive to ABA at all concentrations tested (Fig. 8 D and data not shown). Furthermore, when young seedlings germinated on ABA-free MS plates were transferred to MS plates containing 60 or 100 μm ABA, root growth of thePKS18T/D transgenic lines was only ∼40% of that in the wild type plants (data not shown). These observations indicated that both germination and postgermination growth of thePKS18T/D transgenic plants were hypersensitive to ABA. To further search the in vivo role ofPKS18, we also generated dominant negative PKS18mutant lines (designated pks18) by RNAi. The expression ofPKS18 transcript was examined in 4 randomly chosen, independent pks18 RNAi lines including pks18-5and pks18-8. The results showed that PKS18 was silenced in all these pks18 RNAi lines to various extents (Fig. 7 B). Control RT-PCRs showed that expression of either the PKS6 or PKS11 gene that is closely related toPKS18 (data not shown) was not affected in thesepks18 RNAi lines (Fig. 7 B). There was no PCR product amplified from RNA samples without reverse transcription (data not shown), indicating an absence of contaminated DNA. Over 20 independent T2 and T3 pks18RNAi lines were tested for ABA responses, and 2 representative T3 homozygous lines (i.e. pks18-5 andpks18-8) were presented here. When seeds were planted on ABA-free MS agar media, seed germination of these RNAi lines was similar to that of the wild type. However, with supplementation of 0.3 μm ABA in the media, seed germination of thepks18 RNAi lines was earlier than the wild type (data not shown), and cotyledon greening/expansion and root growth were less inhibited as compared with the wild type (Fig.9 A). In these pks18RNAi lines, percentage of seedlings with green cotyledons was much higher than that in the wild type on 0.3 μm ABA medium (Fig. 9 B). Roots of these RNAi lines at 0.3 μmABA also grew significantly better than those of the wild type (Fig.9 C). ABA dose response of these RNAi lines was also examined. As compared with the wild type, roots of these transgenic lines grew better under all ABA concentrations tested (Fig.9 D, pks18-8 data not shown). Furthermore, root elongation of these pks18 RNAi seedlings after transfer from ABA-free MS media was faster than the wild type on MS plates containing either 60 or 100 μm ABA (data not shown). These results suggest that both germination and postgermination growth of thepks18 RNAi lines were less sensitive to ABA. PKS18 is a novel leaf-specific PKS protein. The PKSes are a novel subfamily of SNF1/AMPK protein kinases. Like most kinases including SOS2, PKS18 contains a putative activation loop in the catalytic domain. In most kinases, this activation loop is phosphorylated when the kinase is active. Phosphorylation of the activation loop stabilizes it in an open conformation that is permissive for substrate binding and catalysis (19Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that a threonine to aspartic acid mutation in the activation loop activated PKS18 (Fig. 3). SOS2 was also activated by substitution of a threonine residue with aspartic acid in its activation loop (5Guo Y. Halfer U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The yeast SNF1 kinase was activated by the phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in the activation loop of the catalytic subunit (20McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36460-36466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that PKS18 may be activated in vivo through activation loop phosphorylation at the threonine residue. Two residues, Ser744 and Ser748, in the activation loop of protein kinase D were phosphorylated during its activation (21Waldron R.T. Rey O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The use of site-specific antibodies identified a serine, Ser876, within the C-terminal region of human protein kinase D2 as a phosphorylation site (22Sturany S. Lint J.V. Muller F. Wilda M. Hameister H. Hocker M. Brey A. Gern U. Vandnhede J. Gress T. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3310-3318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). PKS18 contains a serine residue that is absolutely conserved in the activation loop of theArabidopsis PKSes (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). It remains to be determined whether PKS18 can also be activated by substitution of the serine residue with aspartic acid or glutamic acid. Protein kinases have diverse responses to divalent cations. In this study, we observed a preference of manganese over magnesium of PKS18T/D for both autophosphorylation and peptide phosphorylation activity (Fig.4). PKS18T/D was activated by micromolar amounts of Mn2+, the physiological concentrations in plant cells, indicating possible activity regulation of the kinase by Mn2+ in vivo. Activation of some kinases by Mn2+ has been considered to reflect its involvement in a kinase complex (23Su J.Y. Eriksob E. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14430-14437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). PKS18 may be cytosolic, as suggested by its amino acid sequence. The pH optimum of PKS18T/D activity (Fig. 5 A) was within the range of cytosolic pH vaules, and was similar to that of a spinach SNF1-like protein kinase (pH between 7.0 and 7.5 in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+) (24Toroser D. Plaut Z. Huber S.C. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). PKS18 phosphorylated two serine-containing peptides but not the threonine-containing peptide (Fig. 5 B). SOS2 did not phosphorylate commonly used protein substrates, such as myelin basic protein, histone H1, and casein, but did phosphorylate these peptide substrates (9Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the PKS isoforms have strict substrate selectivity. In this study, p3 (ALARAASAAALARRR) was found to be the preferred peptide substrate for PKS18T/D. A synthetic peptide, AMARA (AMARAASAAALARRR), which contains the (hydrophobic)-X-(basic)-X-X-Ser-X-X-X-(hydrophobic) residue, was found to be a minimal recognition motif (25Dale S. Wilson W.A. Edelman A.M. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) for a cauliflower AMPK/SNF1 homologue (26Ball K.L. Barker J. Halford N.G. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This peptide was also used in the purification of two SNF1-like protein kinases from spinach leaves (27Sugden C. Donaghy P.G. Halford N.G. Hardie D.G. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 257-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of the hydrophobic and basic residues may be a determinant for the specific substrate of the PKS. However, further systematic analysis of phosphorylation motifs using a series of variants of the p3 peptide is needed to define the importance of these residues for each PKS isoform. In this study, we found that PKS18T/D was slightly inhibited by high concentrations of ATP. ATP inhibition has been demonstrated in other kinases, such as the phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK) (28Tuininga J.E. Verhees C.H. Oost J.V.V. Kengen S.W.M. Stams A.J.M. Vos W.M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21023-21028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mammalian PFK has a separate ATP inhibition site (29Kemp R.G. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), whereas PFK from E. coli shows a mechanism-based, nonallosteric inhibition by ATP (30Zheng R.G. Kemp R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23640-23645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of ATP inhibition in PKS18 is still unclear. In addition, some protein kinases are known to utilize GTP as well as ATP as a phosphate donor (31Muranaka T. Banno H. Machida Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2958-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Whether PKS18 has distinct phosphate donor specificity is unclear. SOS2 plays a specific role in plant adaptation to high sodium and low potassium stresses (4Liu J. Ishitani M. Halfter U. Kim C.-S. Zhu J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Different members of the kinase subfamily could have distinct roles in plants. In this study, we investigated PKS18 function in vivo by both overexpression and loss-of-function approaches. Overexpression of PKS18 might affect the functions of other PKSes, and thus overexpression phenotypes need to be interpreted with caution. We therefore further confirmed PKS18 function by using RNAi to silence PKS18 gene expression. The ABA hypersensitive phenotype of the transgenic plants overexpressingPKS18T/D and ABA hyposensitive phenotype ofPKS18-silenced plants provide a strong case for the involvement of PKS18 in ABA signaling pathway in vivo (Figs.8 and 9). Our results demonstrate an important role of the SnRK3 protein kinase subgroup in plant ABA signaling pathway. A SnRK2 protein kinase, PKABA1, has been found to be involved in ABA signaling in wheat (32Andeberg R.J. Walker-Simmons M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10183-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). PKABA1 was transcriptionally up-regulated by ABA (32Andeberg R.J. Walker-Simmons M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10183-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and this kinase may suppress gibberellic acid induced gene expression during cereal grain germination (33Gomez-Cadenas A. Verhey S.D. Holappa L.D. Shen Q., Ho, D. Walker-Simmons M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1767-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Another Ser/Thr protein kinase gene (Esi47) from wheatgrass might also be involved in the same signaling pathway as that forPKABA1 (34Shen W. Gómez-Cadenas A. Routly E.L., Ho, T.-H.D. Simmonds J.A. Gulick P.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1429-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A guard cell-specific, ABA-activatedVicia faba Ser/Thr protein kinase, AAPK, has been shown to control the activity of plasma membrane anion channels (35Li J. Wang X.-Q. Waston M.B. Assmann S.M. Science. 2000; 287: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). TwoArabidopsis protein Ser/Thr phosphatase 2C-type genes,ABI1 and ABI2 (ABA-insensitive 1 and2), are known to function in controlling plant ABA sensitivity during seed germination and vegetative growth (36Koornneef M. Leon-Kloosterziel K. Schwartz S.H. Zeevaart J.A.D. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 36: 83-89Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 37Leung J. Giraudat J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 199-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 38McCourt P. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 219-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Some of the protein kinases in ABA signaling may interact with the ABI phosphatases. An Arabidopsis protein phosphatase is known to interact with a Ser/Thr receptor-like kinase (39Stone J.M. Collinge M.A. Smith R.D. Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These and our results strongly support the notion that protein phosphorylation plays an important role in ABA signaling pathway in plants. Recent studies have identified a number of transcription factors such as ABI5 and AREBs that are phosphorylated in response to ABA (40Finkelstein R.R. Lynch T.J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 41Uno Y. Furihata T. Abe H. Yoshida R. Shinozaki K. Yamaguchi- Shinozaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 4782-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The constitutive overexpression of the ABRE (ABA-responsive elements) binding factor, ABF3 or ABF4, in Arabidopsis resulted in ABA hypersensitivity phenotypes (43Kang J. Choi H., Im, M. Kim S.Y. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), although the gene knockout/silencing phenotype of either of them is not known yet. Whether the function of PKS18 in plant ABA signaling is mediated by phosphorylating and activating these transcription factors is not known. The involvement of a PKS protein in ABA signaling is not surprising as the PKS family of kinases are known to interact with the SOS3 subfamily of calcium sensors, and as such are involved in calcium signaling (5Guo Y. Halfer U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Although the calcium sensor(s) that interacts with PKS18 has yet to be identified, the presence of a FISL motif in PKS18 suggests that this kinase binds to one or more of the calcium sensors (5Guo Y. Halfer U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.-K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Ca2+ is a second messenger mediating cellular responses to ABA (37Leung J. Giraudat J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 199-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). ABA has been recently found to activate multiple Ca2+ fluxes in stomatal guard cells in Commelina communis (44MacRobbie E.A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12361-12368Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). ABA treatment might result in a strong and transient increase in cytosolic [Ca2+], which may be perceived by a specific calcium sensor(s). Therefore, we propose that PKS18 functions in mediating calcium signaling in response to ABA signals. Identification of PKS18 interacting partners and substrate proteins will help clarify the precise role of this kinase in ABA signaling pathway in plants. Additionally, it is possible that PKS18 may control plant responses to external ABA by regulating the phosphorylation state of an ABA transport system either in the plasma membrane or vacuole. We have recently demonstrated that SOS2 phosphorylates and regulates the activity of the plasmas membrane sodium/proton antiporter SOS1 (45Quintero F.J. Ohta M. Shi H. Zhu J.-K. Pardo J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9061-9066Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W1996267597,"Lipoproteins are present in a wide variety of bacteria and are anchored to membranes through lipids attached to the N-terminal cysteine. The Lol system of Escherichia colimediates the membrane-specific localization of lipoproteins. Aspartate at position 2 functions as a Lol avoidance signal and causes the retention of lipoproteins in the inner membrane, whereas lipoproteins having residues other than aspartate at position 2 are released from the inner membrane and localized to the outer membrane by the Lol system. Phospholipid:apolipoprotein transacylase, Lnt, catalyzes the last step of lipoprotein modification, converting apolipoprotein into mature lipoprotein. To reveal the importance of this aminoacylation for the Lol-dependent membrane localization, apolipoproteins were prepared by inhibiting lipoprotein maturation. Lnt was also purified and used to convert apolipoprotein into mature lipoproteinin vitro. The release of these lipoproteins was examined in proteoliposomes. We show here that the aminoacylation is essential for the Lol-dependent release of lipoproteins from membranes. Furthermore, lipoproteins with aspartate at position 2 were found to be aminoacylated both in vivo and in vitro, indicating that the lipoprotein-sorting signal does not affect lipid modification.

Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent modification reactions sequentially take place on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane: formation of a thioether linkage between the N-terminal cysteine residue of the mature region and diacylglycerol by phosphatidylglycerol:prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (Lgt), cleavage of the signal peptide by prolipoprotein signal peptidase (LspA), and aminoacylation of the N-terminal cysteine residue by Lnt (2Sankaran K. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19701-19706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mature lipoproteins thus formed have a lipid-modified cysteine at the N terminus. Globomycin (3Inukai M. Enokita R. Torikata A. Nakahara M. Iwado S. Arai M. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1978; 31: 410-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) inhibits LspA and causes the accumulation of diacylglyceryl prolipoproteins in the inner membrane (4Mizushima S. Bacterial Outer Membranes as Model Systems. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1987: 163-185Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, lipoproteins are anchored to the periplasmic side of either the inner or outer membrane through N-terminal lipids depending on the lipoprotein-sorting signal present at position 2 (5Yamaguchi K., Yu, F. Inouye M. Cell. 1988; 53: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Five Lol proteins are involved in the sorting and outer membrane localization of lipoproteins. LolCDE, an ABC (ATP bindingcassette) transporter in the inner membrane releases outer membrane-directed lipoproteins from the inner membrane in an ATP-dependent manner (6Yakushi T. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32576-32581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), leading to the formation of a water-soluble complex between one molecule each of lipoprotein and LolA (9Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 10Tajima T. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The LolA-lipoprotein complex crosses the periplasm and then interacts with the outer membrane receptor LolB, which is essential for the anchoring of lipoproteins to the outer membrane (11Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 12Tanaka K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6538-6542Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). On the other hand, aspartate at position 2 functions as a Lol avoidance signal, thereby causing the retention of lipoproteins in the inner membrane (13Masuda K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7390-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the lipoprotein-sorting signal is recognized at the release step involving LolCDE and LolA (14Yokota N. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30995-30999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,15Terada M. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47690-47694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, since Lnt, which catalyzes the last step of lipoprotein maturation, is not found in Gram-positive bacteria such asBacillus subtilis, despite the high conservation of the other two lipoprotein-processing enzymes, Lgt and LspA, it has been suggested that aspartate at position 2 might inhibit the last step of lipoprotein modification, aminoacylation of apolipoprotein, thereby leading to the generation of different species of lipoproteins that are specific to the inner membrane (16Seydel A. Gounon P. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 810-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although a study suggesting the aminoacylation of Staphylococcus aureus lipoproteins has been reported (17Navarre W.W. Daefler S. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 441-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), direct evidence for this was not presented. Moreover, it is uncertain whether or not aminoacylation of the N-terminal cysteine is important for the release of outer membrane-specific lipoproteins. Although it has been reported that apolipoprotein lacking an amino-linked acyl chain is localized to the outer membrane in a temperature-sensitive lnt mutant ofSalmonella typhimurium (18Gupta S.D. Gan K. Schmid M.B. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16551-16556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), such a conditional mutant may give ambiguous results as discussed under “Discussion.” To address these issues, apolipoproteins were prepared and subjected to in vitro aminoacylation with purified Lnt and phospholipids. We show here that the aminoacylation of the N-terminal cysteine residue is essential for the release of outer membrane-specific lipoproteins. Furthermore, we found that the inner membrane-specific lipoproteins also have an amino-linked acyl chain, indicating that inner membrane-specific and outer membrane-specific lipoproteins undergo the same lipid modification. Globomycin was a kind gift from Masatoshi Inukai, Sankyo Co. LolCDE (13Masuda K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7390-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and LolA (9Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) were purified as described. Anti-Pal antibodies were raised in rabbits as described (8Narita S. Tanaka K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Anti-His tag antibodies were purchased from Promega. Synthetic phosphatidylethanolamine, PG,1 cardiolipin, and PC were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. E. coli phospholipids were also from Avanti Polar Lipids and washed with acetone as reported (19Tokuda H. Shiozuka K. Mizushima S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). [2-palmitoyl-9, 10-3H]dipalmitoyl PC (3.7 TBq/mmol) and [1, 2-dipalmitoyl-1-14C]dipalmitoyl PC (4.1 GBq/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Tran35S-label (a mixture of 70% [35S]methionine and 20% [35S]cysteine, 1,000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from ICN Pharmaceuticals. Talon, a metal-chelating column, was from Clontech. Sucrose monocaprate and β-d-octylglucopyranoside were purchased from Dojindo Laboratories. To construct pTPH21 encoding Pal-His under the control of tacPO andlacI q, the pal gene of pTAN21 (14Yokota N. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30995-30999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers: 5′-gcagaattcAATAGTAAAGGAATCATTGAAATGCAACTG-3′ (lowercase letters represent the non-native sequence, theEcoRI site is underlined, and the initiation codon is bolded) and 5′-gctttcccggg ttaatgatgatgatgatgatgctcgagGTAAACCAGTACCGCACGACGGTTTTTG-3′ (lowercase letters represent the non-native sequence, theSmaI site is underlined, and the termination codon is bolded). The amplified DNA was digested with EcoRI andSmaI and then inserted into the same restriction site of pTTQ18 (Amersham Biosciences). To construct pTLH631 encoding Lnt-His under the control oftacPO and lacI q, the chromosomallnt gene was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers; 5′-gcatgaattcggaggtttaaatttATGGCTTTTGCCTCATTAATTGAACGCCAG-3′ (lowercase letters represent non-native sequence, the EcoRI site is underlined, and the initiation codon is bolded) and 5′-caattcaagctt aatgatgatgatgatgatgctcgagTTTACGTCGCTGACGCAGACTCATCAACAC-3′ (lowercase letters represent non-native sequence, theHindIII site is underlined, and the termination codon is bolded). The amplified DNA was digested with EcoRI andHindIII and then inserted into the same site of pTTQ18. To construct pTHPAL(D) encoding Pal(D)-His under the control oftacPO and lacI q, pTPH21 was digested withSalI and HindIII followed by Klenow enzyme to make the ends blunt and then followed by self-ligation. TheSphI site located outside of pal-his was lost with this treatment. The MfeI-SphI fragment of the resultant plasmid encompassing the signal cleavage region of proPal was replaced with a double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide to convert serine (TCT) at position 2 into aspartate (GAC). E. coli B is more sensitive to globomycin than other E. coli strains (20Hussain M. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3707-3712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus was used for large scale preparation of apolipoproteins. The strain harboring pTAN21, pTPH21, or pTHPAL(D) was grown on LB supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until the optical density at 660 nm reached 0.8. For the preparation of mature lipoproteins, 1 mm IPTG was added for induction for 1 h. For the preparation of apoPal-His or apoPal(D)-His, cells were treated with 5 μg/ml globomycin for 5 min and then induced with IPTG for 1 h. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), which contained 5 μg/ml globomycin for apolipoprotein preparation, and then disrupted by sonication. Total membrane fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 200,000 ×g for 15 min. The reported method (21Hussain M. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5177-5182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was slightly modified to prepare apolipoproteins. Lnt was inactivated for 30 min by treating membrane fractions with a large volume of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) at 75 °C (final concentration, 30 μg protein/ml). Both heated and unheated membranes were sequentially washed with acetone and diethylether and then solubilized with 2% octylglucoside in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Supernatants were obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min and then incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with 3 ml of Talon resin, which had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 2% octylglucoside. The resin was packed into a column and then washed with 30 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2% octylglucoside, 0.3 m NaCl, and 1 mm imidazole. Pal-His, apoPal-His, and apoPal(D)-His were eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2% octylglucoside, 0.3m NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole and then precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. After washing with acetone and diethylether, the purified proteins were suspended at 0.5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1.2% sucrose monocaprate, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mmATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Where indicated, apoPal-His was further purified on a MonoS column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and 2.0% sucrose monocaprate. Elution was performed with a linear pH gradient (5.0–5.9). E. coli MC4100 cells (22Casadaban M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar) harboring pTLH631 were grown at 37 °C on LB supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. When the optical density at 660 nm reached 0.8, the cells were induced with 1 mm IPTG for 1 h. The cells were converted into spheroplasts and then disrupted with a French pressure cell at 4,000 p.s.i. Membrane fractions were obtained by centrifugation and then solubilized with 1% sucrose monocaprate in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Lnt-His was purified with Talon resin as described for the preparation of Pal-His. Proteoliposomes were reconstituted as described (13Masuda K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7390-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The reconstitution mixture (100 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.2% sucrose monocaprate, 0.8 mg of E. coli phospholipids, 4 μg of LolCDE, and 0.1 μg of MonoS-purified apoPal-His with or without 1 μg of Lnt-His was kept on ice for 10 min and then diluted with 1 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgSO4, and 0.1 m NaCl followed by overnight dialysis against the same buffer. Reconstituted proteoliposomes were recovered by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in 100 μl of the dialysis buffer supplemented with 2 mm ATP. Release of mature Pal-His generated in proteoliposomes was examined at 30 °C for 20 min in the presence and absence of 20 μg/ml LolA, as reported (13Masuda K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7390-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The reported method (23Gupta S.D. Wu H.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 78: 37-42Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was slightly modified to examine the aminoacylation of apoPal-His by Lnt-His in the presence of various phospholipids as acyl chain donors. The reaction mixture contained the indicated amounts of apoPal-His, Lnt-His, and phospholipids in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin, 0.4 mNaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mmMgCl2. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h and terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid on ice. The precipitate was successively washed with acetone and diethylether. Aminoacylation was examined by SDS-PAGE. In some experiments, mature Pal-His was generated in the presence of radiolabeled phospholipids and then reconstituted into proteoliposomes for the release assay. Lpp and LppDK were purified from MC4100 and JE5505 (24Hirota Y. Suzuki H. Nishiyama Y. Yasuda S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1417-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) cells harboring pJY116 (25Yakushi T. Tajima T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2857-2862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. These lipoproteins were obtained as SDS-trichloroacetic acid soluble fractions (26Hirashima A., Wu, H.C. Venkateswaran P.C. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5654-5659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further purified by SDS-PAGE. The purified lipoproteins were dried under vacuum, suspended in 80% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroactetic acid, and then subjected to mass spectrometry. Matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry was performed with a Voyager DE-STR mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) operating in the linear mode with delayed extraction of ions, using 3, 5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid as the matrix. Two-point external calibration based on the average [M+H]+ and [M+2H]2+ ions of cytochrome C (Sigma) was performed. SDS-PAGE (20Hussain M. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3707-3712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), immunoblotting (27Yamada H. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18577-18581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and subcellular fractionation (11Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) were performed as described. Labeled lipoproteins were detected by fluorography with Enlightning (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To facilitate the purification of lipoprotein derivatives, a hexa-histidine tag was attached to the C terminus of Pal (Pal-His), an outer membrane-specific lipoprotein (28Chen R. Henning U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Pal and Pal-His were overexpressed in E. coli MC4100 cells. The addition of a His tag caused slower migration of Pal by ∼0.8 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A). The membrane localization of Pal and Pal-His was examined with uninduced cells since overproduction might prevent their correct localization. Both Pal and Pal-His expressed at a basal level were exclusively localized to the outer membrane together with OmpA, a non-lipidated outer membrane protein, whereas SecG (29Nishiyama K. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3409-3425Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) was found in the inner membrane (Fig.1 B). We later found that the overproduction of Pal and Pal-His affected neither growth nor their correct localization to the outer membrane (data not shown). Spheroplasts were prepared from induced cells, labeled with [35S]methionine, and then subjected to the LolA-dependent release assay (Fig.1 C). As reported previously (14Yokota N. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30995-30999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), some Pal molecules were released in the absence of LolA, and the addition of LolA caused the complete release of Pal. Pal released in the absence of LolA was shown previously to exist as an oligomer (14Yokota N. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30995-30999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The release of Pal-His was essentially the same as that of Pal (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that the attachment of a His tag to the C terminus of Pal does not affect the Lol-dependent release or localization to the outer membrane. Globomycin is a specific inhibitor of LspA (20Hussain M. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3707-3712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and causes the accumulation of diacylglyceryl prolipoprotein in the inner membrane. Subsequent heating at 75 °C inactivates Lnt but not LspA (21Hussain M. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5177-5182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby causing the accumulation of apolipoprotein (Fig. 2 A). Pal and Pal-His were overexpressed in the presence and absence of globomycin and then examined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Pal antibodies (Fig. 2 B). Mature Pal (lane 1) and Pal-His (lane 2) were the major products in the absence of globomycin. Globomycin caused the generation of slower migrating bands for both Pal- (lane 3) and Pal-His- (lane 4) overproducing cells, indicating that these bands represent diacylglyceryl derivatives of proPal and proPal-His. Two minor bands detected in lane 2 migrated to positions corresponding to Pal and diacylglyceryl proPal. However, since globomycin had no effect on the amounts of these bands (lane 4), it is not certain whether or not these bands represent Pal and diacylglyceryl proPal expressed from the chromosome of Pal-His-overproducing cells. Membranes prepared from Pal-His-overproducing cells grown in the presence of globomycin were heated at 75 °C (lane 5). This treatment caused a decrease in diacylglyceryl proPal-His (uppermost band) and the appearance of a new material, apoPal-His, which migrated between mature Pal and Pal-His. The heat-treated samples were partially purified with a metal-chelating column. The fastest migrating band corresponding to mature Pal did not bind to the column, and the eluate contained only mature Pal-His and apoPal-His as major materials (lane 6). So far as we examined, the SDS-PAGE shown in Fig.2 B gave the best separation of these three Pal materials. To confirm the generation of apoPal-His, the partially purified sample was blotted to membranes, and bands corresponding to mature Pal-His and apoPal-His were subjected to amino acid sequencing. With the blot corresponding to apoPal-His, a modified residue was found at the N terminus that was followed by the sequence SSNK, which coincided with the N-terminal second to fifth residues of Pal. In contrast, no signal was obtained with the blot corresponding to Pal-His. Partially purified apoPal-His fraction was reconstituted into proteoliposomes together with LolCDE and subjected to the LolA-dependent release assay. A small amount of Pal-His contaminating the apoPal-His fraction was released by the addition of LolA, whereas apoPal-His remained in proteoliposomes (data not shown). These results suggested that the aminoacylation of the N-terminal cysteine is essential for the release of Pal-His. His-tagged Lnt was overexpressed in MC4100 cells, and cellular proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 A). The band indicated by an asterisk corresponded to the molecular mass of Lnt-His and reacted with antibodies against the His tag (data not shown). In contrast, two other bands, indicated by arrows, seemed to be degradation products of Lnt lacking the C-terminal region since they were overproduced but did not react with the antibodies. Membrane fractions were prepared from Lnt-His-overproducing cells and solubilized with 1% sucrose monocaprate. Lnt-His was then purified to homogeneity with a metal-chelating column (Fig. 3 B). To examine the in vitro aminoacylation of apoPal-His, the apoPal-His fraction obtained with a metal-chelating column was further purified on a cation exchange column to remove contaminating Pal-His. The purified apoPal-His fraction containing a very small amount of Pal-His (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and3) was reconstituted into proteoliposomes with LolCDE and E. coli phospholipids in the presence and absence of Lnt-His. The reconstitution of Lnt caused the conversion of apoPal-His into a slightly slower migrating band (lanes 5,7, and 8), indicating the in vitrogeneration of mature Pal-His. The addition of LolA to proteoliposomes containing Lnt caused release of Pal-His (lane 8), whereas no release occurred with proteoliposomes containing no Lnt (lane 4). These results, taken together, indicate that the complete lipid modification of the outer membrane-specific lipoprotein is essential for the release reaction. As reported previously for Pal (7Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), the release of Pal-His from proteoliposomes was completely dependent on LolA (compare lanes 6 and 8). The LolA-independent release of Pal-His observed with spheroplasts did not occur. This may suggest that oligomeric Pal-His released in the absence of LolA reassociates with proteoliposomes, thereby causing absolute LolA-dependent release. It may also be possible that the LolA-independent release from proteoliposomes is not efficient enough to cause the oligomerization of Pal. In any event, the LolA-independent release from spheroplasts is also dependent on the outer membrane signals (14Yokota N. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol.

MonoS-purified apoPal-His was incubated in Triton X-100 with E. coli phospholipids in the presence and absence of Lnt-His. As observed in proteoliposomes (Fig.4), the addition of Lnt converted apoPal-His into a slower migrating Pal-His (Fig. 5, A andB, compare lanes 1 and 2). Synthetic phosphatidylethanolamine, PG, and cardiolipin, having various lengths of acyl chains, were also used as acyl chain donors (Fig.5 A, lanes 3 to 10). In all cases, mature Pal-His was formed. Furthermore, phosphatidylethanolamine possessing acyl chains of 6:0 to 22:6 was also found to be effective as an acyl chain donor (Fig. 5 B). These results, taken together, indicate that Lnt has a broad specificity as to the length and degree of saturation of fatty acyl chains. To examine the effects of lipoprotein sorting signals on the in vitroaminoacylation, we used phospholipids containing radiolabeled fatty acids as acyl chain donors. Only labeled PC, which is absent inE. coli, was commercially available. We therefore first examined the conversion of apoPal-His into mature Pal-His with non-labeled PC and found that Lnt efficiently catalyzed the acyl chain transfer from PC to apoPal-His (Fig.6 A). Most apoPal-His molecules disappeared in the presence of not only E. coliphospholipids but also PC with a concomitant increase in mature Pal-His. We then used [3H]- or [14C]-labeled dipalmitoyl PC for the in vitroaminoacylation of apoPal-His. After the aminoacylation reaction, the labeled lipoproteins were precipitated and then reconstituted into proteoliposomes together with LolCDE followed by the release assay in the presence and absence of LolA (Fig. 6 B). The3H label was exclusively present at the 2-palmitoyl moiety of PC, whereas the 14C label was present at both the 1- and 2-palmitoyl moieties. SDS-PAGE and fluorography revealed that the incorporation of the labeled acyl chain into apoPal-His was absolutely dependent on Lnt and occurred with both labels (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, both [3H]-labeled and [14C]-labeled Pal-His were released on the addition of LolA. As for apoPal-His, apoPal(D)-His having the inner membrane retention signal, aspartate at position 2, was prepared and subjected to in vitro aminoacylation in the presence of [14C]-labeled PC (Fig. 6 B). Lnt incorporated the 14C-label into apoPal(D)-His. However, [14C]-labeled Pal(D)-His remained in proteoliposomes even in the presence of LolA, indicating that the inner membrane retention signal does not inhibit the aminoacylation of lipoproteins but does inhibit the LolCDE- dependent release reaction. In vitro aminoacylation of apoPal-His was also performed with non-labeled dimyristoyl (14:0)-, dipalmitoyl (16:0)-, and dioleoyl (18:1)-PG to generate mature Pal-His having aminoacyl chains of different lengths. Mature Pal-His was then reconstituted into proteoliposomes with LolCDE and examined for LolA-dependent release. The three PGs were found to generate Pal-His, which could be released by the addition of LolA (data not shown), indicating that the release reaction catalyzed by LolCDE and LolA allows these three fatty acids to be aminoacyl chains of lipoproteins. To confirm that lipoproteins having aspartate at position 2 are aminoacylated in vivo, Lpp and its derivative possessing aspartate at position 2, LppDK (25Yakushi T. Tajima T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2857-2862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were purified fromE. coli cells and analyzed by mass spectrometry (Fig.7). The molecular masses corresponding to the main peaks observed with Lpp and LppDK were within the range of the expected molecular masses of the respective lipoproteins, which are modified with both diacylglycerol and amino-linked acyl chain. On the other hand, the observed molecular masses were significantly greater than those of apolipoproteins. Furthermore, the difference in molecular mass (30.0) observed between the main peaks of Lpp and LppDK could be explained by the difference in molecular weight between aspartate and serine (28.0). In addition to the main peak, another peak was detected with both Lpp and LppDK. The molecular mass corresponding to this second peak was smaller than that of the main peak by 235 to 239. The intensity of this second peak detected with LppDK was significantly lower than that of the main peak (Fig. 7 B). Although the second peak exhibited higher intensity on mass spectrometry of Lpp (Fig. 7 A), this peak was almost negligible with a different preparation of Lpp (data not shown), suggesting that the second peak is a degradation product of the main peak material. These results, taken together, indicate that lipid modification of the N-terminal cysteine is essentially the same between inner membrane-specific and outer membrane-specific lipoproteins. The three lipoprotein-processing enzymes, Lgt, LspA, and Lnt, are widely conserved in Gram-negative bacteria, whereas Lnt homologues have not been found in Gram-positive bacteria. These observations suggested the possibility that the last step of lipoprotein modification is required only for lipoproteins destined to the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Thus the inner membrane retention signal, aspartate at position 2, might function to inhibit the last step of lipoprotein modification, aminoacylation of apolipoprotein, thereby causing the retention of lipoproteins in the inner membrane. To address these issues, we prepared apolipoprotein and established the conditions for in vitro aminoacylation of it. We found that aminoacylation of the N-terminal cysteine is essential for the release of lipoproteins from the inner membrane. However, the results presented here also revealed that the inner membrane retention signal does not affect the mode of lipid modification of lipoproteins. It was therefore established that the inner membrane retention signal functions at the release step. We recently revealed that lipoproteins having the inner membrane retention signal do not compete with outer membrane-specific lipoproteins for the release reaction or stimulate the ATPase activity of LolCDE. These results indicate that aspartate at position 2 functions as an LolCDE avoidance signal, therefore causing the retention of lipoproteins in the inner membrane (13Masuda K. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7390-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Since the preparation of a large amount of apoPal-His without contaminating Pal-His was technically difficult, we could not perform similar experiments with apoPal-His. Therefore, it remains to be clarified whether aminoacylation is required for the recognition by LolCDE or the complex formation with LolA. Moreover, it remains unknown why aspartate at position 2 prevents the recognition of lipoproteins by LolCDE. At present, we can only speculate that the N-terminal structure of lipoproteins possessing aspartate at position 2 is significantly different from that of lipoproteins possessing other than aspartate at position 2. Gupta et al. (18Gupta S.D. Gan K. Schmid M.B. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16551-16556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the isolation of a temperature-sensitive lnt mutant of S. typhimurium. Since apoLpp generated at a non-permissive temperature was found to be covalently linked to peptidoglycan, as was mature Lpp, they concluded that apoLpp was localized to the outer membrane. However, we showed previously that Lpp mislocalized to the inner membrane also forms a covalent linkage with peptidoglycan (25Yakushi T. Tajima T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2857-2862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here strongly indicate that aminoacylation is essential for the in vivo outer membrane localization of lipoproteins. The in vitro aminoacylation with purified Lnt revealed that this enzyme exhibits broad specificity to acyl chain donors as to species of phospholipids and fatty acids. Lnt was able to transfer the acyl chain of PC, which is not present in E. coli. Moreover, Lnt transferred acyl chains of various lengths and degrees of saturation. However, since we did not examine the rate of the aminoacylation reaction, there may be preferred acyl chain donors. In vitro maturation of apoPal-His with the myristoyl, palmitoyl, or oleoyl moiety resulted in the formation of mature Pal-His, which can be released in a LolA-dependent manner. Considering the broad specificity of Lnt to acyl donors, any fatty acid present in E. coli phospholipids is expected to be transferred to lipoproteins. Therefore, LolCDE should not exhibit strict specificity to aminoacyl chains to efficiently release lipoproteins from the inner membrane. By means of the in vitro aminoacylation of apoPal-His, we are now able to produce lipoproteins modified with unusually short or long acyl chains or highly unsaturated ones. It seems to be interesting to examine whether or not such an unusual acyl chain has any effect on the recognition of lipoproteins by LolCDE, LolA, and LolB.

The tryptophan response allows measurement of PHF stability made by different tau isoforms and mutants. Unexpectedly, the stability of PHFs is quite low (denaturation half-points ∼1.0 m GdnHCl), implying that incipient aggregation should be reversible and that the observed high stability of Alzheimer PHFs is due to other factors. The stability increases with the number of repeats and with tau mutants promoting β-structure, arguing for a gain of toxic function in frontotemporal dementias. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was used to analyze the distances of Tyr310 to tryptophans in different positions.

Their main constituent is the protein tau in a highly phosphorylated form. Tau normally functions as a microtubule-associated protein that is involved in microtubule stabilization and neurite outgrowth (1Cleveland D.W. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 227-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 2Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 425-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In principle, tau is one of the most soluble proteins of the brain, and therefore one of the key issues in molecular Alzheimer's research is the question of how and why tau becomes insoluble and aggregates into PHFs. To study this, one has to measure tau aggregation in vitro, and one has to develop assays to detect the aggregation rapidly and quantitatively. Such assays could then be used to study the factors that lead to tau aggregation, and to search for reagents that inhibit aggregation and could therefore be used in prevention or therapy. Human tau is coded by a single gene located on chromosome 17. Early in development there is only one isoform, the smallest “fetal” isoform htau23 (352 residues). During neuritogenesis, six main isoforms are generated in the human central nervous system by alternative splicing, the largest being htau40 (441 residues, Fig. 1) (3Lee G. Cowan N. Kirschner M. Science. 1988; 239: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 4Goedert M. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 117: 287-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kosik K. Orecchio L. Binder L. Trojanowski J. Lee V. Lee G. Neuron. 1988; 1: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). One additional higher molecular form is generated in peripheral nerves (big tau). The six main isoforms in the central nervous system are distinguished by the presence or absence of two near-N-terminal inserts (coded by exons 2 and 3) and the second of four semi-conserved repeated motifs of 31–32 residues in the C-terminal half (coded by exon 10). One broadly distinguishes two major domains of tau, the C-terminal “assembly domain” and the N-terminal “projection domain.” The assembly domain binds to microtubules through the 3 or 4 repeated motifs (R1–R4) and the adjacent proline-rich sequences; the projection domain is not involved in microtubule binding, points away from the microtubule surface, and may serve other functions that are presently not well understood. The repeat domain plays a dual role; it is not only involved in microtubule stabilization but also forms the core of Alzheimer PHFs after pathological aggregation (3Lee G. Cowan N. Kirschner M. Science. 1988; 239: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 6Wischik C.M. Novak M. Edwards P.C. Klug A. Tichelaar W. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This process is usually very slow (days or weeks), corresponding to the highly soluble nature of tau, and the verification of a bona fide PHF-like structure requires extensive structural characterization (electron microscopy, x-ray scattering, CD, or Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy). Several principles have emerged over the past few years. The repeat domain is important for PHF aggregation (9Wille H. Drewes G. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 10Wilson D.M. Binder L.I. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar); aggregation is strongly favored by oxidation that leads to tau dimerization by disulfide cross-links at Cys322 (9Wille H. Drewes G. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 13Schweers O. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8463-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar); aggregation is also strongly enhanced in the presence of polyanions such as heparin, ribonucleic acids, or acidic peptides such as poly(Glu) (12Perez M. Valpuesta J.M. Medina M. Montejo de Garcini E. Avila J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 14Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Based on these principles, an assay of PHF aggregation in vitro has been developed that can be used in solution and in real time (16Friedhoff P. von Bergen M. Mandelkow E.M. Davies P. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15712-15717Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). It is based on the fact that the fluorophore thioflavine S added to the aggregation solution, strongly increases its fluorescence yield when PHFs are formed. This opened up the possibility of performing kinetic studies of PHF aggregation; for example, it was shown that the aggregation process follows a nucleation-elongation mechanism (17Friedhoff P. Schneider A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10223-10230Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 18King M.E. Ahuja V. Binder L.I. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14851-14859Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although the ThS assay works reproducibly, it is conceptually not ideal because it relies on an exogenous reagent that could possibly alter some features of the aggregation pathway. We have therefore searched for aggregation assays based on signals that are intrinsic to tau protein. In many cases, internal fluorophores provide signals when the fluorescence yield or excitation and emission spectra respond to the reaction process. For proteins, such intrinsic signals are essentially restricted to tyrosine and tryptophan residues. Recently some studies (19Garzon-Rodriguez W. Vega A. Sepulveda-Becerra M. Milton S. Johnson D.A.

Nguyen J.T. Kirschner D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) showed similar approaches for other amyloids. Tau contains 5 Tyr residues but no Trp. We therefore explored the response of the Tyr fluorescence to the aggregation of tau into PHFs, and we show here that it can indeed be used to monitor the process. However, a much clearer signal is obtained from Trp. Because wild-type tau contains no Trp, it has to be introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. We used its fluorescence as a reporter to obtain new insights into the conformation of tau in the soluble state and after incorporation into PHFs. We show that the Trp fluorescence can be used to determine the stability of PHFs, their solvent accessibility (a measure of the compactness of PHFs), and the proximity of Trp and Tyr residues, as seen by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Heparin (averageM r of 3000) and thioflavine S were obtained from Sigma. Human tau isoforms and constructs (see Fig. 1) were expressed inEscherichia coli as described (21Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Schröter C. Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Steiner B. Berling B. Meyer H.E. Mercken M. Vandermeeren A. Goedert M. Mandelkow E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1593-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The numbering of the amino acids is that of the isoform htau40 containing 441 residues (22Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). The protein was expressed and purified as described by making use of the heat stability and fast protein liquid chromatography Mono S (Amersham Biosciences) (23Gustke N. Trinczek B. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9511-9522Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Separation of the monomeric and dimeric protein of htau39-Y310W was performed by applying protein samples in PBS on a Superose 12 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) under control of the Smart-HPLC System (Amersham Biosciences) with a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The purity of the protein fractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay. The mutations of K18 (Q244W, L266W, ΔK280, ΔK280-Y310W, I297W, Y310W, I328W, and I360W), K19 (Y310W), htau40 (Y310W), and htau39 (Y310W) were created by site-directed mutagenesis, which was performed using the Quick Change kit (Stratagene, Germany) and the plasmid pNG2 (24Barghorn S. Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Ackmann M. Biernat J. von Bergen M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11714-11721Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Plasmids were sequenced on both strands. Aggregation was induced by incubating varying concentrations of tau isoforms or tau constructs (typically in the range of 50–100 μm) in volumes of 20–500 μl at 37 °C in PBS, pH 7.4, containing the anionic cofactor heparin. The ratio of heparin:protein was roughly 1:4 as described (17Friedhoff P. Schneider A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10223-10230Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 24Barghorn S. Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Ackmann M. Biernat J. von Bergen M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11714-11721Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Incubation time varied between minutes up to several days. The formation of aggregates was ascertained by thioflavine S fluorescence and electron microscopy. Fluorescence was measured with a Fluoroskan Ascent (Labsytems, Germany) with an excitation filter of 440 nm and an emission filter of 510 nm in a 384-well plate. Measurements were carried out at room temperature in PBS, pH 7.4, and 10 μm ThS unless otherwise stated. Background fluorescence and light scattering of the sample without ThS was subtracted when needed. Protein solutions were diluted to 1–10 μm, and proteins were placed on 600-mesh carbon-coated copper grids for 1 min, washed with 2 drops of H2O, and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 45 s. The specimens were examined in a Philips CM12 electron microscope at 100 kV. Microtubule assembly was monitored by light scattering at an angle of 90° and 350 nm wavelength on a Kontron spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments, Germany). 5 μm tau was mixed with 30 μm tubulin dimer at 4 °C. The reaction was started by raising the temperature to 37 °C with defined heating rates. Turbidity was measured in a quartz cuvette (10-mm path length). Three parameters were extracted from the curves: the maximum turbidity at steady state, the rate of assembly, and the lag time between the temperature jump and the start of the turbidity rise. Three experiments were performed and averaged. The preparation of samples for FTIR was performed as described (25von Bergen M. Barghorn S., Li, L. Marx A. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48165-48174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). FTIR experiments were performed on a Jasco FT-IR410 instrument (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany). Atmospheric water vapor was removed by flushing the spectrometer with nitrogen. Interferograms were mostly recorded between 1700 and 1600 cm−1 at a spectral resolution of 1 cm−1, and 128 spectra were averaged. They were acquired in the transition mode using CaF2 cells, separated by spacers of different thicknesses (usually 25 μm). After recording a reference spectrum of the instrument and of the D2O lot used, the protein solutions were applied, and the absorbance spectrum of the sample was measured. The water vapor background was subtracted from the D2O spectra and the sample spectra before subtracting the D2O spectra from the sample spectrum. To facilitate comparison the spectra were then normalized with respect to their maxima. All fluorescence experiments were performed on a Spex Fluoromax spectrophotometer (Polytec, Waldbronn, Germany), using 3 × 3-mm quartz microcuvettes from Hellma (Mühlheim, Germany) with 20 μl of sample volume. For tyrosine excitation spectra, scans ranged from 250 to 300 nm at a fixed emission wavelength of 310 nm, and for emission spectra, scans ranged from 290 to 450 nm at fixed excitation wavelength of 275 nm. For tryptophan excitation spectra, scans ranged from 210 to 310 nm at a fixed emission wavelength of 350 nm, and for emission spectra, scans ranged from 300 to 400 nm at fixed excitation wavelength of 290 nm. In all cases, the slit widths were 5 nm and integration time was 0.25 s, and photomultiplier voltage was 950 V. Preparations of samples for fluorescence spectroscopy were similar to those used for FTIR. Steady-state fluorescence quenching experiments were performed on either soluble or aggregated proteins. Aliquots of the stock quenching solutions (5m) were added into the cuvette containing 10 μm protein in PBS, pH 7.4. Quenching experiments were performed with excitation at 280 nm. Stock quenching solutions were freshly prepared at concentrations of 5 m. Quenching data were fitted to the Stern-Volmer equation,F o/F c = 1 +K SV[Q], where F oand F c are the fluorescence intensity in the absence and in the presence of quencher, [Q], at concentrationc, respectively, and K SV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant. For the disaggregation of PHFs, preformed PHFs were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at room temperature (table top centrifuge TL-100, Beckman) and resuspended in PBS. 10 μm of this PHF solution was diluted with GdnHCl (stock solution of 8m) to various concentrations, incubated at 37 °C overnight, and analyzed the next day. To circumvent inconsistencies due to variations in concentrations, the emission spectra were normalized to their maximum. The structure of tau is currently not known because it is not amenable for x-ray crystallographic or NMR analysis. Our earlier results, based on x-ray solution scattering, CD, and FTIR spectroscopy, have suggested that soluble tau has a mostly random coil structure and that aggregation into PHFs is accompanied by a shift in conformation to a substantial β-sheet content (25von Bergen M.

Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The sequences involved in the conformational transition are located within the repeat domain of tau (hexapeptide motifs PHF6* (Val275–Lys280) in the second repeat and PHF6 (Val306–Lys311) in the third repeat). In principle such changes could be monitored by fluorescence changes, notably that of tryptophan because of its sensitivity to the local environment. Unfortunately, tau contains very few aromatic amino acids. The longest isoform htau40 consists of three phenylalanines (Phe8, Phe346, and Phe379), five tyrosines (Tyr18, Tyr29, Tyr197, Tyr310, and Tyr394), and no tryptophan. None of these lie in alternatively spliced regions so that all tau isoforms have the same aromatic residues. In order to measure the impact of PHF formation on the fluorescence, we introduced tryptophans into different sites within the repeat domain (Fig. 1 C) because this is crucial for PHF assembly (6Wischik C.M.

In most cases we performed conservative exchanges at aliphatic (L266W, I297W, and I328W) or aromatic amino acids (Y310W and F346W), except for Q244W, with the aim of minimizing any perturbation in the protein structure (Fig. 1 C). Because of the prominent role of the hexapeptide motifs PHF6 and PHF6* in PHF assembly, we were especially interested in the impact of PHF formation on tryptophan in these sequences. The fluorescence spectra of the repeat domain construct K18 (containing the single tyrosine Tyr310 within the PHF6 hexapeptide motif but no tryptophan) and the spectra of mutated K18-Y310W are shown in Fig. 2. The tyrosine containing K18 exhibits only a small change in the fluorescence spectrum during PHF assembly, showing a slight red shift of ∼2–3 nm (Fig. 2,A and B). Although this effect is detectable, it is too small to serve as a reliable marker of PHF assembly. By contrast, the mutant K18-Y310W shows a clear shift upon PHF assembly, equivalent to a blue shift of ∼15 nm from 354 nm in the soluble state to 339 nm in the polymerized state. The positions of the excitation and emission maxima, 288 and 354 nm, indicate that the Trp residue is almost fully exposed to the solvent in the soluble state and not buried in the interior of the protein. The blue shift following PHF aggregation is explained by an increased hydrophobicity in the local environment (30Gasymov O.K. Abduragimov A.R. Yusifov T.N. Glasgow B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14754-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Ropson I.J. Dalessio P.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8594-8601Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); it suggests that Trp310 becomes buried in a hydrophobic pocket within the PHFs. Similar results to the repeat domain K18 were obtained with the full-length isoforms htau40 and htau39 (lacking R2). The unmodified proteins contain five Tyr residues (Tyr18, Tyr29, Tyr197, Tyr310, and Tyr394) whose fluorescence spectra are essentially the same as in K18 (data not shown, see Fig. 2, A and B). However, when a Trp is introduced at residue 310 it dominates the spectrum. In the soluble state, the excitation and emission maxima are 288 and 352 nm, indicating almost full solvent exposure. This means that Trp310 does not become embedded in other domains of the protein, even in the full-length protein. When htau40 is aggregated into PHFs, a blue shift down to 334 nm is observed (Fig.2 E). This shift is even more extensive than that of K18 and suggests effective burial of the tryptophan in a hydrophobic pocket inside the PHFs. A similar, although less extensive, blue shift is observed with the Y310W mutant of htau39 (from 352 nm in the soluble to 342 nm in the polymerized state, Fig. 2 F). In summary, these results are consistent with an open structure of the repeat domain in the soluble state and with its burial inside the PHFs during aggregation. All the other tryptophan single mutations show blue shifts from the soluble to the aggregated state whose magnitude depends on the site of mutation (see Fig. 7). Introducing mutants into the structural analysis of tau and PHFs requires evidence that the mutation does not alter the specific activities of the protein. We will illustrate this by data on PHF assembly, PHF morphology, analysis of the conformation of soluble and polymerized protein, and effects on MT assembly. In our earlier studies on PHF aggregation, we made use of the accelerating effect of polyanions and monitored aggregation by the fluorescence of the added dye thioflavine S (17Friedhoff P. Schneider A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10223-10230Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Thus, for the present study we checked whether the Trp mutants would behave similarly by the same criteria. Fig.3 illustrates that this is the case for PHF assembly, with only minor modifications. The repeat domain K18 aggregates with roughly similar kinetics, with or without the Y310W mutation; in both cases added polyanions (heparin) are needed to achieve efficient aggregation (Fig. 3 A). The result is noteworthy because residue 310 is part of the hexapeptide motif VQIVYK involved in the generation of β-structure during aggregation. Apparently the exchange of Tyr to Trp does not destroy the capacity of the motif to support aggregation, in contrast to Pro mutations (27von Bergen M. Friedhoff P. Biernat J. Heberle J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Next we checked the K18-ΔK280 mutant. This mutant was discovered in a search for FTDP-17 mutations (32Rizzu P. Van Swieten J.C. Joosse M. Hasegawa M. Stevens M. Tibben A. Niermeijer M.F. Hillebrand M. Ravid R.

Genet. 1999; 64: 414-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar); it is particularly interesting forin vitro studies because this mutation is highly efficient for PHF assembly (24Barghorn S. Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Ackmann M. Biernat J. von Bergen M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11714-11721Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) even without polyanions (25von Bergen M.

Here, too, we find that the Y310W mutation has little influence on the behavior of the protein. In either case it is able to aggregate into PHFs with similar kinetics without polyanions, although added heparin still has an accelerating effect (Fig. 3 B). By having shown that the Y310W mutation leaves the capacity for PHF formation intact, we tested whether the fluorescence of Trp310 could serve as an intrinsic reporter of aggregation. Fig. 3 C shows the wavelength of the emission maximum during the time course of aggregation. Soluble K18 and K19 begin at values of ∼354–356 nm and change gradually toward final values of ∼340–346 nm (filled circles and squares). The half-times, ∼10 h, are of comparable magnitude but longer than the values obtained with ThS fluorescence (∼5 h, see Fig. 3 A), indicating that these two fluorophores emphasize somewhat different aspects in the aggregation process. A likely interpretation is that the fluorescence of Trp310or ThS responds differently to intermediate steps in PHF formation (e.g. dimerization, nucleation, and annealing). In addition, the weighting of the assembly states is different. In the case of Trp310, all molecules contribute, resulting in an overlap of spectra with different emission maxima. In the case of ThS, the spectrum is dominated by molecules attached to aggregates, whereas the contribution of monomers, dimers, and low oligomers is thought to be negligible. Thus, it is possible that incipient aggregation is highlighted by ThS but not by the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp. The mixture of aggregation states is well illustrated by the curves of the K18-ΔK280 mutants (Fig. 3 C, open andfilled triangles) which start already midway on they axis, around 348 nm. This is due to the high tendency of this mutant to aggregate, so that oligomers and small aggregates become noticeable even at the earliest time points. Note that K19-Y310W reaches the same extent of polymerization as K18-ΔK280-Y310W in the presence of heparin regarding the emission maximum, whereas K18-Y310W in the presence of heparin behaves similar to K18-ΔK280-Y310W in the absence of heparin. This shows one advantage of the Trp fluorescence in comparison to the ThS fluorescence because the extent of the shift is defined as the ratio of the soluble to the aggregated protein (the exact values for the aggregated protein are taken from TableI, for which PHFs were pelleted and measured without contamination of soluble protein). The extent of polymerization for the proteins was calculated from the relative shift in the emission maximum (Fig. 3 C): K19-Y310W 93%, K18-Y310W 54%, K18-ΔK280-Y310W 56% in the absence of heparin, and 89% in the presence of heparin. Note that with the Trp fluorescence no centrifugation step was needed to determine the efficiency of polymerization.Table IParameters of intrinsic Trp fluorescence of different tau derivativesMutantsEmission maximum in soluble state (Ex at 290 nm)Emission maximum in PHF state (Ex at 290 nm)Midpoint of denaturation GdnHClSlope (K) of quenching by acrylamide, soluble stateSlope (K) of quenching by acrylamide, PHF statemK19-Y310W3533401.2N.D.N.D.K18-Y310W3553391.113.84.2K18-ΔK280-Y310W3483391.89.03.7K18-Q244W3543421.511.37.1K18-L266W3533411.313.68.0K18-I297W3523321.813.53.6K18-I328W3523401.611.05.0K18-F346W3523491.013.69.2K18-I360W3543521.012.011.2ht40-Y310W3523341.013.03.7ht39-Y310W3503420.516.58.1 Open table in a new tab Because proteins can often aggregate in different forms we ascertained that, in the conditions chosen here, the aggregation products were indeed PHFs or related structures. Fig. 4shows a panel of fibers assembled from different K18 mutants. They show the morphology and variability of PHFs assembled in vitro,i.e. widths between 10 and 20 nm, a twist which can be variable (between 50 and 200 nm), or even “straight fibers” similar to those that are also observed in Alzheimer's disease. In addition there are frequent short fiber stubs (100–200 nm) that may be breakdown products during specimen preparation. All of these features are typical of PHFs obtained from Alzheimer brain or reassembled from wild-type tau, indicating that the Trp mutations do not alter the building plan of the assembly reaction. The aggregation of tau into PHFs is accompanied by the formation of local β-structure around the hexapepti"

We have used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to measure the diffusional mobilities of chimeras consisting of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the C terminus of four tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes: malate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and succinyl-CoA synthetase. The GFP-enzyme chimeras were localized selectively in the mitochondrial matrix in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and COS7 cells. Laser photobleaching using a 0.7-μm diameter spot demonstrated restricted diffusion of the GFP-enzyme chimeras. Interestingly, all four chimeras had similar diffusional characteristics, ∼45% of each chimera was mobile and had a diffusion coefficient of 4 × 10−8 cm2/s. In contrast, unconjugated GFP in the mitochondrial matrix (targeted using COX8 leader sequence) diffused freely (nearly 100% mobility) with a greater diffusion coefficient of 20 × 10−8cm2/s. The mobility of the GFP-enzyme chimeras was insensitive to substrate source, ATP depletion, or inhibition of the adenine nucleotide translocase.

The tricarboxylic acid cycle processes two-carbon units from carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids in the form of acetyl-CoA to generate reducing equivalents (NADH and FADH2) for ATP production by the electron transport chain. Several lines of indirect evidence have suggested that enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle associate to form a functional complex, ormetabolon (5Srere P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 109-110Google Scholar). The metabolon has been proposed to facilitate substrate channeling from one enzyme to another, with consequent reduction in metabolite pool sizes, reduction in lag times, increase in metabolic rates, protection of intermediates, and reduction of diffusive barriers (6Welch G.R.

Numerical simulations provided evidence for a continuous surface channel that may facilitate electrostatic channeling of substrate between the active sites of three consecutive tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes (malate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and aconitase) (16Elcock A.H.

In yeast, disruption of the genes encoding mitochondrial citrate synthase (CIT1) and malate dehydrogenase give cells that cannot grow on acetate (a purely oxidative energy source) despite the existence of alternative enzymes (such as CIT3) to carry out the same functions (25Kispal G.

Last, the broadening of fluorine 19 resonances from fluorotryptophan-labeled mitochondrial citrate synthase in intact yeast cells has been interpreted in terms of reduced rotational mobility as a consequence of enzyme complexation (27Haggie P.M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3941-3945Google Scholar).There remains, however, controversy about the existence of a tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme metabolon because of potential dilution and other artifacts during isolations of complexes and the paucity of direct evidence of physical interactions among enzymes in intact cell systems. The purpose of this study was to test for physical associations of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes in mammalian cellsin vivo by measurement of the diffusional mobilities of GFP 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; CS, citrate synthase; MD, malate dehydrogenase; ICD, γ-isocitrate dehydrogenase; SCS, α-succinyl-CoA synthetase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CCCP, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone; diOC6(3), 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide. 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; CS, citrate synthase; MD, malate dehydrogenase; ICD, γ-isocitrate dehydrogenase; SCS, α-succinyl-CoA synthetase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CCCP, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone; diOC6(3), 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide.-labeled tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme chimeras. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was used to measure diffusion. We reasoned that enzymes present in a large, multienzyme complex should have reduced mobility compared with unconjugated GFP and that various unrelated enzymes may have similar diffusional characteristics. We previously applied photobleaching methods to quantify the rheological properties of the cytoplasm and aqueous compartment of intracellular organelles (reviewed in Ref. 28Verkman A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 27-33Google Scholar), including the diffusion of unconjugated GFP in the mitochondrial matrix (29Partikian A. Ölveczky B. Swaminathan R., Li., Y. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 821-829Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, it was found that unconjugated GFP diffused freely in the crowded mitochondrial matrix at a rate only ∼3 times slower than in saline. It was proposed that unhindered GFP diffusion might occur if mitochondrial enzymes were bound to the matrix-facing surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a relatively macromolecule-free aqueous space. We find here that the diffusion of four unrelated tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes was similar and independent of cell metabolic state, but significantly reduced compared with the diffusion of unconjugated GFP. The results provide in vivo biophysical evidence for physical association among tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes in living mammalian cells.RESULTSThe four enzymes studied here carry out different reactions and are located at different sites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle as shown in Fig. 1 A. Fig. 1 Bshows the tricarboxylic acid enzyme-GFP chimeras used for mammalian cell transfections, along with their putative subunit organizations and oligomeric sizes (without GFP). Unconjugated GFP was targeted to the mitochondrial matrix by fusion downstream from a COX8 leader sequence ((COX8)-GFP), which is partially cleaved after entering the matrix. GFP was fused downstream of MD and CS, which are homodimeric enzymes, and downstream of single subunits of the heteromeric enzymes ICD (γ-subunit) and SCS (α-subuit). Fig. 1 C shows a strict mitochondrial pattern of fluorescence in CHO cells after transient transfection with each of the five constructs. Similar staining was seen in transfected COS7 cells (not shown). Immunoblot analysis of transfected cells probed with anti-GFP antibody (Fig.1 D) showed predominant bands at the predicted molecular sizes for the respective subunits fused to GFP of (in kDa) ∼60 (MD-GFP), 75 (CS-GFP), 65 (γ-ICD-GFP), and 60 (α-SCS-GFP), indicating that the chimeras remained intact after transfection. Bands at 27 kDa and slightly larger size were seen for mitochondrial (COX8)-GFP, representing cleaved and non-cleaved moieties.Photobleaching with image detection was done to examine whether the mitochondrial matrix compartment is contiguous in the cell models studied here. Fig. 2 A shows a representative series of images for an MD-GFP-transfected CHO cell. A region of the cell of ∼5 μm in diameter was bleached (marked bywhite cross-hairs in the pre-bleach image) by a brief laser pulse, and serial images were collected to visualize the diffusion of unbleached MD-GFP into the darkened zone. Fluorescence recovery (increased fluorescence in bleached region) was not observed for MD-GFP and the other chimeras (and for unconjugated GFP), indicating that the mitochondrial matrix compartment is not contiguous over long distances. Similar results were found in transfected COS7 cells. In contrast, image photobleaching experiments on GFP-labeled endoplasmic reticulum show complete fluorescence recovery (35Dayel M.J. Hom E.F. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2843-2851Google Scholar), indicating a contiguous lumenal compartment.Figure 2Photobleaching of enzyme-GFP chimeras in transfected CHO cells.

Data are shown for a 2-s continuous acquisition, followed by a 4–14-s discontinuous acquisition (at 1 data point/s) to identify long term recovery processes. Compared with unconjugated GFP in which fluorescence recovered by >80% with a recovery half-time (t12) of ∼20 ms (see below, Fig.3 B, left), the fluorescence recovery of the enzyme-GFP chimeras was slowed (t12∼100 ms), and only a fraction of the bleached fluorescence (∼40%) showed recovery. Interestingly, the fluorescence recovery curves for the four unrelated enzyme-GFP chimeras were similar in terms of kinetics and extent of recovery. Similar results were found for transfected COS7 cells (Fig. 2 C).Figure 3Diffusion coefficients and percentages mobility of enzyme-GFP chimeras determined by quantitative spot photobleaching.

Chem. 2002; 277: 16419-16425Google Scholar), fluorescence recovery by diffusion-independent processes, such as “reversible photobleaching” involving triplet-state recovery, is generally observed and must be distinguished from diffusion-dependent “irreversible photobleaching.” Photobleaching of paraformaldehyde-fixed cells was used to distinguish between diffusion-independent and -dependent fluorescence recovery, since fixation immobilizes GFP. Fig. 3 A (fourright panels) shows a small, rapid fluorescence recovery (t12∼5 ms) after photobleaching fixed cells transfected with each of the GFP-enzyme chimeras. The insetsshow data on an expanded time scale. For comparison, fluorescence recovery from unfixed MD-GFP expressing live cells is also shown (left panel). The ∼5-ms fluorescence recovery process was confirmed to be diffusion-independent fluorescence recovery by its independence of spot size (0.7–2.0 μm, using 100× and 60× objectives), whereas diffusion-dependent recovery in unfixed cells was strongly spot size-dependent (not shown). Since diffusion-independent recovery was much faster than diffusion-dependent recovery for the enzyme-GFP chimeras under the experimental conditions here, quantitative analysis of diffusion could be done by exclusion of the first 15 ms of the fluorescence recovery.To determine the absolute diffusion coefficients (D) of the enzyme-GFP chimeras, comparative measurements were performed for the unconjugated (COX8)-GFP (Fig. 3 B,left). The diffusion of unconjugated GFP was substantially faster and more complete than the diffusion of the enzyme chimeras, and similar in CHO and COS7 cells. Values of D, computed from t12 by methods described previously (29Partikian A. Ölveczky B. Swaminathan R., Li., Y. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 821-829Google Scholar, 33Ölveczky B.P. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2722-2730Google Scholar) were (2.0 ± 0.2) × 10−7 cm2/s for CHO cells and (2.5 ± 0.3) × 10−7 cm2/s for COS7 cells (S.E., n = 5). Quantitative determination of percentage fluorescence recovery required a geometric correction for the size of the bleached volume relative to the total volume of the mitochondrial matrix; for example, the apparent percentage recovery can be no greater than 50% if half of the mitochondrial volume is bleached. To determine the geometric correction factor empirically, photobleaching measurements were done after staining the lipidic limiting membranes of mitochondria with the dye diOC6(3) (Fig. 3 B, right). We reasoned that the percentage recovery should be 100% if no geometric correction was needed, but <100% when a non-zero fraction of the projected mitochondrial area is bleached. Fig. 3 B(right) shows percentages recovery of 86 ± 3% and 85 ± 3% (n = 5–7) for diOC6(3)-labeled mitochondria in CHO and COS7 cells, respectively. Fig. 3 C summarizes diffusion coefficients (top) and corrected percentages recovery (bottom) for unconjugated GFP and for each of the enzyme-GFP chimeras. There was no significant difference in diffusion coefficients or percentages recovery of the four enzyme-GFP chimeras, but these values were much lower than for unconjugated GFP in the mitochondrial matrix.Control studies were done to investigate whether the fluorescence recovery depended on the amount of expressed enzyme-GFP protein and to estimate the amount and function of the expressed chimera compared with the native enzyme. Fig. 4 A(left) shows fluorescence recovery curves of CHO cells expressing different amounts of MD-GFP as indicated by the averaged relative brightnesses. Background-corrected fluorescence intensities varied by 17-fold from brightly to dimly fluorescent cells. Fig.4 A (right) shows no significant effect of the level of MD-GFP expression on deduced percentages recovery or diffusion coefficients. To estimate the function of expressed MD-GFP and CS-GFP relative to endogenous enzyme, functional assays were performed in homogenates of non-transfected versus transfected cells (Fig. 4 B). The MD activity of MD-GFP transfected cells was ∼25% higher than in non-transfected cells, and CS activity was increased by ∼35% in CS-GFP transfected cells. Given a measured transfection efficiency of ∼50% in these studies (by counting fluorescent versus total cells using a 60× oil objective), the average amount of MD and CD overexpression in transfected cells was ∼50 and ∼70%, respectively, of that present endogenously in non-transfected cells. Furthermore, the activity of endogenous CS in MD-GFP transfected cells and of MD in CS-GFP transfected cells was similar to that in non-transfected cells.Figure 4Control studies of enzyme-GFP expression.

Representative data for MD-GFP and CS-GFP are shown in Fig.5, A and B, respectively, and averaged diffusion coefficients and percentages mobility for all three GFPs are summarized in TableI. Substrate was varied from a glycolytic source (6 mm glucose, as in Figs. 2 and 3) to an oxidative source (6 mm pyruvate, first curves), as well as a mixed glycolytic/oxidative source (6 mm glucose + 1 mm pyruvate, second curves). There was no significant effect of substrate on diffusion coefficient or percentage recovery. Similar results were obtained for the diffusion of ICD and SCS (not shown). The inhibitors of metabolism 2-deoxyglucose (without other substrate, third curves) and iodoacetic acid (fourth curves) also had no significant effect on the diffusion of MD-GFP, CS-GFP, or unconjugated GFP in the mitochondrial matrix. Inhibition of the adenine nucleotide translocase with atractyoside also did not affect enzyme diffusional mobility (fifth curves). Collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential with the protonophore CCCP, or increasing mitochondrial calcium concentration with the ionophore A23187, resulted in rounding of mitochondria (Fig. 5 C, right) and apparent immobilization of the enzyme-GFP chimeras and unconjugated GFP (example shown in Fig. 5 C, left). Similarly, inhibition of the mitochondrial ATPase by oligomycin resulted in extensive mitochondrial fragmentation and rounding. Meaningful evaluation of GFP diffusion is not possible after mitochondrial calcium elevation or collapse of the pH/potential gradient, because the fragmented/rounded mitochondria are comparable in size or smaller than the laser spot diameter.Figure 5Effect of putative modulators of metabolism and mitochondrial function on the diffusion of MD-GFP (A) and CS-GFP (B) in CHO cells.Representative photobleaching recovery curves shown for bleach conditions as in Fig. 2 B.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONAs described in the Introduction, a substantial body of indirect evidence suggests that enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle assemble in multienzyme complexes to facilitate metabolism. The consequent channeling of substrate from active site to active site, by direct transfer or concentrating effects, is proposed to reduce metabolite pool sizes, reduce lag times, increase metabolic rates, protect labile intermediates, and overcome diffusive barriers (6Welch G.R. Easterby J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 193-197Google Scholar, 7Anderson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 308: 111-145Google Scholar, 8Hochachka P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For example, isolation of enzyme complexes (as described in Refs. 21Mitchell C.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 769-774Google Scholar and 22Grandier-Vazielle X. Bathany K. Chaignepain S. Camougrand N. Manon S. Schmitter J.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9758-9769Google Scholar) depends on the details of isolation conditions and may be affected by the greatly diluted state after mitochondrial disruption. The preservation of carbon 13 asymmetry despite conversion through symmetrical intermediates (23Sumegi B. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9106-9110Google Scholar, 24Sumegi B. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12725-12729Google Scholar) could be interpreted in terms of transient complexation of a tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme with the previous enzyme-substrate complex. The restricted rotational mobility of an enzyme (27Haggie P.M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3941-3945Google Scholar) can be interpreted in terms of enzyme binding to the mitochondrial inner membrane rather than complexation with other enzymes. The increased metabolic rate after genetic fusion of successive enzymes in a pathway (13Lindbladh C. Brodeur R.D. Lilius G. Bülow L. Mosbach K. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11684-11691Google Scholar, 14Lindbladh C. Rault M. Haggland C. Small W.C. Mosbach K. Bülow L. Evans C. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11692-11698Google Scholar, 15Shatalin K. Lebreton S. Rault-Leonardon M. Velot C. Srere P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 881-889Google Scholar) is not surprising and does not prove that complexation occurs in vivo. Finally, the rapid diffusion of unconjugated GFP in the mitochondrial matrix (29Partikian A. Ölveczky B. Swaminathan R., Li., Y. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 821-829Google Scholar) suggests that metabolite channeling may not be required to overcome diffusive barriers if metabolites, like the much larger GFP, are able to diffuse rapidly in the matrix. Thus, although enzyme complexation and metabolite channeling is an attractive hypothesis, the evidence for the existence of complexes in vivo is not conclusive.We used photobleaching recovery to measure the diffusional mobilities of four tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. Two of the enzymes (MD and CS) assemble as homodimers and the other two (ICD and SCS) as heterotetramers. These enzymes were chosen as having different sizes and structures, as well as different sites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (see Fig. 1 A). In addition, a practical consideration was that the C terminus GFP fusions for these enzyme subunits did not affect mitochondrial targeting or function; indeed, GFP fusions were unsuccessful for several other subunits of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. Transfection of mammalian cells with cDNAs encoding each of the four enzyme-GFP chimeras yielded mitochondria-specific staining. Control studies showed that enzyme-GFP diffusion was not dependent on the level of expression and that the amount of added enzyme by transfection was relatively small compared with the amount of endogenous enzyme.The photobleaching experiments indicated that each of the four tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes was present in two pools, an apparently immobile pool that did not diffuse measurably (in a 0.7 μm spot over at least 14 s) and a"

Necdin has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome, a human neurodevelopmental disorder associated with genomic imprinting. Here we demonstrate that ectopic expression of necdin induces a neuronal phenotype in neuroblastoma cells. Necdin was undetectable in mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells under undifferentiated and differentiated conditions. N1E-115 cells transfected with necdin cDNA showed morphological differentiation such as neurite outgrowth and expression of the synaptic marker proteins synaptotagmin and synaptophysin. In addition, Western blot analysis of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) family members Rb, p130, and p107 revealed that necdin cDNA transfectants contained an increased level of p130 and a reduced level of p107, a pattern seen in differentiated G0 cells. The transcription factors E2F1 and E2F4 physically interacted with necdin via their carboxyl-terminal transactivation domains, but only E2F1 abrogated necdin-induced growth arrest and neurite outgrowth of neuroblastoma cells. Overexpression of E2F1 in differentiated N1E-115 cells induced apoptosis, which was antagonized by co-expression of necdin. These results suggest that necdin promotes the differentiation and survival of neurons through its antagonistic interactions with E2F1.

Prader-Willi syndrome retinoblastoma protein bromodeoxyuridine terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling maltose-binding protein fetal bovine serum phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate Necdin is a 325-amino acid protein encoded in a cDNA sequence that has been isolated from a subtraction library of neurally differentiated mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 cells (1Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The necdin gene is expressed in most of the terminally differentiated neurons, although its expression levels vary among neuronal cell types, being the highest in the hypothalamus and brain stem (2Aizawa T. Maruyama K. Kondo H. Yoshikawa K. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 68: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 3Uetsuki T. Takagi K. Sugiura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 918-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The human necdin gene is mapped to chromosome 15q11.2-q12, a region deleted in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)1 (4Jay P. Rougeulle C. Massacrier A. Moncla A. Mattei M.G. Malzac P. Roeckel N. Taviaux S.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 213: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PWS is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with genomic imprinting, and its major symptoms such as feeding problems, gross obesity, and hypogonadism are consistent with a hypothalamic defect. Human and mouse necdin genes are maternally imprinted and transcribed only from the paternal allele (4Jay P. Rougeulle C. Massacrier A. Moncla A. Mattei M.G. Malzac P. Roeckel N. Taviaux S. Lefranc J.L. Cau P. Berta P. Lalande M. Muscatelli F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 5MacDonald H.R. Wevrick R. Hum. Mol.

Lancet. 1997; 350: 1520-1521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Necdin is not expressed in the cells prepared from PWS patients whose chromosome 15q11.2-q13 region in the paternal allele is deleted. Disruption of the paternal allele of mouse necdin gene results in early postnatal lethality (8Gerard M. Hernandez L. Wevrick R. Stewart C.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), reduction in specific hypothalamic neurons such as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone- and oxytocin-containing neurons, and behavioral alternations, which are reminiscent of human PWS (9Muscatelli F. Abrous D.N. Massacrier A. Boccaccio I. Moal M.L. Cau P. Cremer H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 3101-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that a defect in necdin expression is responsible, at least in part, for various clinical symptoms of PWS. However, little is known about the functional roles of necdin in neuronal differentiation and development. Accumulating evidence has suggested that necdin is a growth suppressor expressed in terminally differentiated cells. Ectopic expression of necdin suppresses the proliferation of several cell lines (10Hayashi Y. Matsuyama K. Takagi K. Sugiura H. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16242-16248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, necdin interacts with viral oncoproteins such as SV40 large T antigen, adenovirus E1A, and the transcription factor E2F1 (11Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These characteristics of necdin resemble those of the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb), a major growth suppressor protein that is mutated in many cancer cells. Rb is believed to play a pivotal role in terminal mitosis and subsequent differentiation during neurogenesis (13Lipinski M.M. Jacks T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7873-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to examine whether necdin also promotes neuronal differentiation through its growth inhibitory property. N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells show differentiated characteristics in response to forced expression of growth suppressors such as Rb and its family members p107 and p130 (14Kranenburg O. Scharnhorst V. Van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15Raschella G. Tanno B. Bonetto F. Negroni A. Claudio P.P. Baldi A. Amendola R. Calabretta B. Giordano A. Paggi M.G. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p73, a p53-related growth suppressor, induces differentiation of N1E-115 cells (16De Laurenzi V. Raschella G. Barcaroli D. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Ranalli M. Catani M.V. Tanno B. Costanzo A. Levrero M. Melino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15226-15231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have attempted to examine whether ectopic expression of necdin induces a neuronal phenotype in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells. We here demonstrate that necdin induces morphological and biochemical markers of neurons in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, we show that necdin and its binding partner E2F1 act antagonistically in the differentiation and apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells. The present gain-of-function study provides valuable information about the functional roles of necdin in the induction and maintenance of the terminally differentiated state of neurons. Mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells (a gift from Dr. H. Higashida, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan) were cloned by limited dilution to obtain the subclone N1E-115(sc2). The cloned cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells in 35-mm dishes, cultured in growth medium for 16 h, and transfected with expression vectors by the calcium phosphate method (17Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J.

Livingston, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) were transfected in combination with pRc-LacZ. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted equally by adding empty pRc/CMV. Cells were cultured in the medium containing 2.5% FBS for 72 h, fixed with 0.25% glutaraldehyde, stained for β-galactosidase activity in situ (18Nishimura I. Uetsuki T. Dani S.U. Ohsawa Y. Saito I. Okamura H. Uchiyama Y. Yoshikawa K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2387-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and observed using a phase-contrast microscope (IX70–22PH, Olympus). Morphologically differentiated cells were judged by the length of neurites with the length more than 2 times the cell body diameter. For Western blot analysis, N1E-115 cells were plated (4 × 105 cells) in 90-mm dishes, cultured overnight in the growth medium, and transfected with pcDNA6/TR carrying blasticidin-resistant gene (Invitrogen) and pRc-necdin (or pRc-necdinΔN) (4 μg each). Cells were cultured in the medium containing 5 μg/ml blasticidin S (Invitrogen) for 60 h, and cell lysates were prepared. Transfected N1E-115 cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 20 min and permeabilized with methanol at room temperature for 20 min. Fixed cells were incubated with the antibodies against β-galactosidase (55976, Cappel) and mouse monoclonal anti-synaptophysin antibody (Sigma) (1:1000) or anti-synaptotagmin (1:500) (a gift from Dr. M. Niinobe, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% normal goat serum at 4 °C overnight. The cells were then incubated at room temperature for 90 min with anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgGs conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Cappel) (1:500) and rhodamine (Cappel) (1:500), respectively. Fluorescent images were observed with a fluorescence microscope (BX60–34-FLAD1, Olympus), taken by CCD camera system (M-3204C, Olympus), and processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software. Cells were morphologically differentiated by culturing in the medium containing 2.5% FBS in the presence of 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) for 3 days. Me2SO-treated or cDNA-transfected N1E-115 cells were collected by centrifugation at 150 × g for 5 min, homogenized by vortexing at 4 °C for 3 min in CSK buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 6.8), 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min to obtain the supernatant. The cell lysates (20 μg of protein/lane) were separated by 7.5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting. The membrane was blocked with 4% nonfat milk in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies against necdin (NC243) (19Niinobe M. Koyama K. Yoshikawa K. Dev. Neurosci. 2000; 22: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (1:3,000), synaptophysin (1:200), synaptotagmin (1:500), and β-tubulin (65-095, ICN Biomedicals) (1:1,000). The following antibodies against cell cycle-related proteins were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: anti-Rb (sc-50) (1:500), anti-p107 antibody (sc-318) (1:500), anti-p130 (sc-317) (1:500), anti-E2F1 (sc-193) (1:500), anti-E2F4 (sc-866) (1:500), anti-cdc2 antibody (sc-54) (1:500), and anti-cyclin A1 antibody (sc-596-G) (1:200). The membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel), goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel), or bovine anti-goat IgG (sc-2350; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at room temperature for 1 h. Proteins were visualized using chemiluminescence method (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). cDNAs encoding various deletion mutants of E2F1 and E2F4 were generated from full-length mouse E2F1 or human E2F4 cDNA (pcDNA3-HA-E2F4) by polymerase chain reaction using synthetic oligonucleotide primers and inserted directionally in pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs) to produce maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins. MBP-E2F1 fusion proteins (∼500 ng) or MBP-E2F4 fusion proteins (1 μg) bound to amylose resin (20 μl of 50% slurry) were incubated with purified His-tagged necdin (50 ng) (12Taniura H. Matsumoto K. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16242-16248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). His-tagged necdin was eluted with 20 mm maltose and detected by Western blotting using the anti-necdin antibody (12Taniura H. Matsumoto K. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16242-16248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The Myc tag was added to E2F1 and E2F4 by subcloning their cDNAs into a 6×Myc tag plasmid (a gift from Dr. M. W. McBurney, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada). cDNAs encoding Myc-tagged E2F1 (amino acids 1–430) and its COOH-terminal deletion mutant E2F1ΔC (amino acids 1–337) were inserted into pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) to construct pRc-MycE2F1 and pRc-MycE2F1ΔC, respectively. cDNAs encoding Myc-tagged E2F4 (amino acids 1–417) and its COOH-terminal deletion mutant E2F4ΔC (amino acids 1–360) were also inserted into pRc/CMV to construct pRc-MycE2F4 and pRc-MycE2F4ΔC, respectively. Combinations of these expression vectors were transiently transfected into N1E-115 cells by the calcium phosphate method, and whole cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection. The cell extracts were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-Myc antibody (9E10) or anti-necdin antibody C2 in CSK buffer (12Taniura H. Matsumoto K. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol.

The complexes were precipitated with Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), eluted with SDS-PAGE buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-necdin antibody NC243 and anti-Myc antibody. N1E-115 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells in 35-mm dishes, cultured overnight in growth medium, and transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid containing the promoter sequence (−241 to +45) of mouse DNA polymerase α catalytic subunit (20Izumi M.

Hanaoka, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) in PGV-B (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan) (0.8 μg), E2F expression vector (0.4 μg of pRc-E2F1 or pcDNA3-HA-E2F4), necdin expression vector (0.2, 0.4, or 0.8 μg of pRc-necdin or pRc-necdinΔN) and pRc-LacZ (0.4 μg). The amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 4 μg by adding empty pRc/CMV. Cells were cultured for 48 h and harvested to measure luciferase activity with a luminometer (Lumat LB9501, Berthold) using a reagent kit (Toyo Ink). Transfection efficiency was normalized by β-galactosidase activity. N1E-115 cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells in 35-mm dishes and cultured in growth medium overnight. Cells were transfected with pRc-necdin, pRc-necdinΔN, pRc-E2F1, pcDNA3-HA-E2F4 (0.4 μg each), and pRc-LacZ (1.2 μg). Total amount of DNA was adjusted to 4 μg by adding empty pRc/CMV. Cells were cultured in the medium containing 2.5% FBS for 84 h and incubated in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 5 h. Cells were fixed and double-stained with anti-BrdUrd antibody (Roche Diagnostics) and the anti-β-galactosidase antibody (1:300). N1E-115 cells were grown on coverslips in 35-mm dishes and transfected with combinations of pRc-LacZ, pRc-E2F1, pcDNA3.1-E2F4, p3xFLAG-necdin, and p3xFLAG-necdinΔN (1.5 μg each) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). p3xFLAG-necdin and p3xFLAG-necdinΔN were constructed by inserting respective cDNAs into p3xFLAG-CMV-14 expression vector (Sigma). The cells were treated with Me2SO 24 h after transfection, fixed, and permeabilized as above. The cells were incubated with the anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (1:300) (Sigma) and the anti-E2F1 antibody (1:500) or the anti-E2F4 antibody (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature, and expressed proteins were visualized with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine B-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Nuclear morphology was examined by staining with 3.3 mm Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at room temperature and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Nuclear DNA fragmentation was analyzed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method (21Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9167) Google Scholar) combined with immunostaining for Flag-tagged necdin, E2F1, or E2F4. TUNEL reactivity and each expressed protein were visualized with Texas Red and FITC, respectively. We first examined whether ectopic expression of necdin induces morphological markers of differentiated neurons in N1E-115 cells. Some N1E-115 cells transfected with necdin cDNA showed morphological characteristics of neurons such as neurite outgrowth and flattened cell body, whereas cells expressing necdinΔN (amino acids 110–325), a mutant defective in binding to E2F1 (11Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), did not show these characteristics (Fig.1 A). Ectopic expression of necdin increased the number of neuron-like cells to 35% of total transfected cells, whereas 10 and 14% of cells transfected with the empty vector (control) and necdinΔN cDNA, respectively, showed morphological differentiation (Fig. 1 B). We analyzed the expression of the synaptic markers synaptophysin and synaptotagmin in necdin cDNA-transfected cells by immunocytochemistry. Both synaptophysin and synaptotagmin were induced in N1E-115 cells transfected with necdin cDNA, whereas cells transfected with the empty vector (control) or necdinΔN cDNA contained very small amounts of these proteins (Fig. 1 C). By Western blot analysis, necdin was undetected in undifferentiated and differentiated N1E-115 cells, whereas the levels of synaptophysin and synaptotagmin were gradually increased by Me2SO treatment (Fig.1 D). Necdin cDNA transfectants selected by blasticidin resistance contained increased levels of synaptotagmin and synaptophysin (Fig. 1 E), suggesting that necdin promotes synaptic differentiation. We analyzed the amounts of cell cycle-related proteins in Me2SO-treated N1E-115 cells by Western blotting (Fig. 2 A). The level of the hypophosphorylated form of Rb was higher than that of hyperphosphorylated Rb at 0 and 72 h, but the levels of hyperphosphorylated Rb remained almost consistent during the course of neuronal differentiation. We also examined the levels of other Rb family members p107 and p130, which are believed to be involved in the cell cycle control during neuronal differentiation (22Slack R.S. Skerjanc I.S. Lach B. Craig J. Jardine K. McBurney M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Callaghan D.A. Dong L. Callaghan S.M. Hou Y.X. Dagnino L. Slack R.S. Dev.

We found that the p107 level markedly decreased, whereas the p130 level markedly increased in response to Me2SO treatment. We also analyzed the levels of the transcription factors E2F1 and E2F4, both of which are binding partners of the Rb family proteins. The amount of E2F1 gradually decreased, whereas that of E2F4 remained almost consistent. We next examined the expression levels of these Rb family proteins in necdin cDNA transfectants (Fig. 2 B). The hypophosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated Rb levels in necdin cDNA-transfected cells were similar to or slightly higher than those of control or necdinΔN-transfected N1E-115 cells. In contrast, the p107 level was greatly reduced, whereas the p130 level increased in necdin cDNA transfectants. Expression of E2F-regulated proteins cdc2 and cyclin A1 was strikingly reduced in necdin cDNA transfectants, and the expression levels of these proteins in undifferentiated cells and cells transfected with the empty vector or necdinΔN cDNA remained high. The E2F1 and E2F4 levels in necdin cDNA transfectants were similar to those of differentiated N1E-115 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that necdin cDNA transfectants resemble differentiated N1E-115 cells in the expression pattern of cell cycle-regulatory proteins. We have previously demonstrated that necdin binds to E2F1 by yeast two-hybrid assay (11Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We examined in vitro binding ability of necdin with E2F1 and E2F4 by using their deletion mutants fused to MBP (Fig.3 A). Necdin bound to the COOH-terminal regions of both E2F1 and E2F4 (Fig. 3 B). By this assay, we were able to narrow the necdin binding regions to E2F1(amino acids 383–430) and E2F4 (amino acids 360–417), which encompass Rb binding region as schematized in Fig. 3 C. We then examined the interactions of necdin with E2F1 and E2F4 in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells by the co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig.4). Expression vectors encoding Myc-tagged E2F and necdin were co-transfected into N1E-115 cells. Major bands of expressed polypeptides were detected at the positions of their predicted sizes (necdin, ∼43 kDa; necdinΔN, ∼35 kDa; Myc-E2F1 and Myc-E2F4, ∼75 kDa; Myc-E2F1ΔC and Myc-E2F4ΔC; ∼65 kDa) (Fig.4 A). In N1E-115 cells, necdin was co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-E2F1 or Myc-E2F4, but not with Myc-E2F1ΔC or Myc-E2F4ΔC (Fig.4, B and C, upper panels). Conversely, MycE2F1 was co-immunoprecipitated with necdin, but not with necdinΔN (Fig. 4, B and C, lower panels). These results suggest that necdin binds to the COOH-terminal transactivation domains of E2F1 and E2F4 in N1E-115 cells.Figure 4Formation of complexes containing necdin and E2Fs in N1E-115 cells. A, expression of necdin, E2F1, E2F4, and their deletion mutants. Cells were transfected with expression vectors for necdin (Ndn) (amino acids 1–325), necdinΔN (NdnΔN) (amino acids 110–325), Myc-tagged E2F1 (MycE2F1) (amino acids 1–430), Myc-tagged E2F1ΔC (MycE2F1ΔC) (amino acids 1–337), Myc-tagged E2F4 (MycE2F4) (amino acids 1–417), and Myc-tagged E2F4ΔC (MycE2F4ΔC) (amino acids 1–360). Cell lysates (20 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted (IB) with anti-necdin (αNecdin) or anti-Myc (αMyc) antibody.B, detection of necdin-E2F1 complex in transfected N1E-115 cells. Whole cell extracts were prepared from cells transfected with combinations of indicated expression vectors. The extracts were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Myc antibody (αMyc) and immunoblotted with anti-necdin antibody (αNecdin) (upper panel) or conversely precipitated with anti-necdin antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody (lower panel). Arrowheads point to the molecular sizes of necdin (upper panel) or Myc-tagged E2F1 (lower panel). C, detection of necdin-E2F4 complex in transfected N1E-115 cells. The complexes containing necdin, necdinΔN, Myc-tagged E2F4, and Myc-tagged E2F4ΔC were immunoprecipitated as in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine functional interactions of necdin with E2Fs, we carried out E2F site-dependent transcription assay in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells using a luciferase reporter carrying a promoter region of mouse DNA polymerase α catalytic subunit (20Izumi M. Yokoi M. Nishikawa N.S. Miyazawa H. Sugino A. Yamagishi M. Yamaguchi M. Matsukage A. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). In this assay, E2F1 and E2F4 induced 15- and 4.5-fold activation, respectively. Co-expressed necdin reduced the E2F1-dependent activity to a maximum of ∼50% of the control value. On the other hand, necdin suppressed E2F4- dependent transcription by ∼30% at most. The E2F binding-defective mutant necdinΔN did not affect E2F-dependent transcription. We next examined whether necdin inhibits cell proliferation (S phase entry) in N1E-115 cells by BrdUrd incorporation assay (Fig.5 B). Combinations of expression vectors for necdin, necdinΔN, E2F1, and E2F4 were transfected into N1E-115 cells along with LacZ expression vector, and BrdUrd-positive cells among β-galactosidase-positive cells were counted. The population of BrdUrd-positive cells was 15% of necdin cDNA transfectants, whereas those among transfectants expressing E2F1 and E2F4 were 42 and 40%, respectively, which were slightly greater than the values of control and necdinΔN (both 34%). The necdin-induced growth suppression was abrogated by E2F1 (36%), but not by E2F4 (19%). Neither E2F1 nor E2F4 altered the population of BrdUrd-positive cells in necdinΔN cDNA transfectants. These results suggest that E2F1 and E2F4 exert different effects on necdin-induced growth suppression of N1E-115 cells. Several lines of evidence have suggested that E2F1 and E2F4 have distinct functions in cell cycle regulation and differentiation (25Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether necdin-induced morphological differentiation of N1E-115 cells is modulated by E2F1 or E2F4 (Fig.6 A). E2F1-transfected cells showed no apparent morphological changes, but co-transfected E2F1 suppressed necdin-induced neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, E2F4per se induced neurite outgrowth, and cells transfected with both necdin and E2F4 showed morphological changes similar to those transfected with necdin alone. We then quantified the modulatory effects of E2F1 and E2F4 on necdin-induced neurite outgrowth. E2F1 slightly increased the number of cells carrying extended neurites, but it antagonized the effect of necdin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, E2F4 alone induced neurite outgrowth, and further increased the number of cells carrying extended neurites in combination with necdin (Fig. 6 C). These results indicate that E2F1 and E2F4 exert opposite effects on necdin-induced morphological differentiation of N1E-115 cells. We have previously reported that ectopic expression of E2F1 induces apoptosis in postmitotic neurons, in which endogenous E2F1 levels were markedly down-regulated (26Azuma-Hara M. Taniura H. Uetsuki T. Niinobe M. Yoshikawa K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether necdin has modulatory effects on E2F1-induced apoptosis in differentiated N1E-115 cells. N1E-115 cells were transfected with each expression vector alone or two vectors in combination, and subsequently treated with Me2SO. Necdin was accumulated in the nucleus and exerted no apparent effects on the nuclear morphology (Fig.7 A). In contrast, E2F1 induced a severe shrinkage of the nucleus, in which DNA was fragmented as detected by TUNEL (Fig. 7, A and B). Co-expression of necdin prevented differentiated N1E-115 cells from E2F1-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, overexpressed E2F4, either alone or in combination with necdin, was distributed primarily in the cytoplasm and had no apparent effect on the nuclear morphology. Quantification of apoptotic and TUNEL-positive cells revealed that necdin suppressed E2F1-induced apoptosis almost completely, whereas the E2F1 binding-defective mutant necdinΔN had little or no anti-apoptotic effect (Fig. 7, C and D). These results indicate that necdin prevents differentiated neuroblastoma cells from E2F1-induced apoptosis. We have recently found that primary dorsal root ganglion neurons, which express high levels of necdin, fail to differentiate properly even in the presence of nerve growth factor when endogenous necdin is down-regulated by necdin antisense oligonucleotide (27Takazaki R. Nishimura I. Yoshikawa K. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells eventually undergo caspase-3-dependent apoptosis, suggesting that necdin is required for the terminal differentiation and survival of nerve growth factor-dependent sensory neurons. Because necdin is not expressed in neural stem cells or transformed cell lines derived from pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma, we speculated that ectopic expression of necdin induces a neuronal phenotype in these necdin-deficient cells. We initially transferred necdin cDNA into multipotent neural stem cells prepared from the neural tube and found that necdin-overexpressing stem cells failed to undergo neuronal differentiation. 2H. Taniura and K. Yoshikawa, unpublished observations. We thus used necdin-defective N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, which have been often used to examine the effects of exogenous genes encoding growth suppressor proteins such as Rb, p130, p107, p27KIP1, and p73 (14Kranenburg O. Scharnhorst V. Van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15Raschella G. Tanno B. Bonetto F. Negroni A. Claudio P.P. Baldi A. Amendola R.

Using this cell line as a gain-of-function model, we were able to demonstrate that necdin induces characteristics of differentiated neurons such as neurite outgrowth (Fig. 1, A and B), changes of expression levels of synaptic marker proteins (Fig. 1, C andE) and cell cycle regulatory proteins (Fig. 2 B), and cell cycle repression (Fig. 5 B). We infer that necdin requires some complementary factors expressed in the neuronal lineage-committed cells (or partially differentiated cells in a neuronal direction) but not in multipotent stem cells. Necdin is initially characterized as a nuclear protein (1Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 2Aizawa T. Maruyama K. Kondo H. Yoshikawa K. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 68: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and is partly associated with the nuclear matrix (28Taniura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Necdin binds to the typical nuclear proteins E2F and p53 (11Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 12Taniura H. Matsumoto K. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16242-16248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that necdin is distributed in the cytoplasm of differentiated neurons and skeletal muscles (19Niinobe M. Koyama K. Yoshikawa K. Dev. Neurosci. 2000; 22: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Taniguchi N. Taniura H. Niinobe M. Takayama C. Tominaga-Yoshino K. Ogura A. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31674-31681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similarly, E2F1 is primarily cytoplasmic in terminally differentiated skeletal muscles, whereas E2F4 is partitioned between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments (30Gill R.M. Hamel P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1187-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although p53 appears in the nucleus during neuronal differentiation, it is present mainly in the cytoplasm in mature differentiated neurons (31Eizenberg O. Faber-Elman A. Gottlieb E. Oren M. Rotter V. Schwartz M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5178-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that nuclear proteins involved in cell cycle regulation are sequestered in the cytoplasm after accomplishment of terminal differentiation. We infer that necdin-induced growth arrest is attributable, at least in part, to the sequestration of E2Fs from their target sites to suppress E2F-dependent transcription, and that the suppression of E2F1-responsive genes triggers the differentiation program in neuroblastoma cells. We have confirmed the previous finding that Me2SO-treated N1E-115 cells express reduced p107 and increased p130 levels (15Raschella G. Tanno B. Bonetto F. Negroni A. Claudio P.P. Baldi A. Amendola R. Calabretta B. Giordano A. Paggi M.G. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A similar expression pattern of these Rb family proteins was observed in necdin cDNA transfectants (Fig. 2 A). These are consistent with the idea that p130 is found in quiescent cells but not in growing cells, whereas p107 is inversely regulated (32Smith E.J. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6965-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Such changes in the expression pattern of Rb family proteins are observed during the course of neuronal differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells (30Gill R.M. Hamel P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1187-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33LeCouter J.E. Whyte P.F. Rudnicki M.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1433-1440PubMed Google Scholar) and neuronal progenitor cells (23Callaghan D.A. Dong L. Callaghan S.M. Hou Y.X. Dagnino L. Slack R.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that changes in the predominance of Rb family proteins from p107 to p130 are correlated with the transition from proliferative state of neuronal progenitor cells to the postmitotic state of differentiated neurons. In contrast to the striking changes in p107 and p130 levels during neuronal differentiation, only a small change in the ratio between hypophosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated Rb was observed in differentiated N1E-115 cells (Fig. 2 B). We observed that differentiated N1E-115 cells and necdin cDNA transfectants contained very low levels of cdc2 and cyclin A1, both of which are up-regulated by E2F (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that E2F is silenced in differentiated N1E-115 cells. Thus, the phosphorylation status of Rb may exert little or no influence on the mitotic quiescence in differentiated neuroblastoma cells expressing high levels of p130 and low levels of E2F1. The present study has shown that necdin interacts with E2F4 as well as E2F1 (11Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). E2F1 is thought to promote the exit from G0phase (34Wang Z.M. Yang H. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15583-15586Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and its overexpression induces apoptosis in quiescent cells (35Kowalik T.F. DeGregori J. Schwarz J.K. Nevins J.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2491-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and postmitotic neurons (26Azuma-Hara M. Taniura H. Uetsuki T. Niinobe M. Yoshikawa K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36Hou S.T. Callaghan D. Fournier M.C. Hill I. Kang L. Massie B. Morley P. Murray C. Rasquinha I. Slack R. MacManus J.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We found that E2F1 abrogated necdin-induced growth arrest and morphological differentiation of N1E-115 cells (Figs. 5 and 6). In addition, differentiated N1E-115 cells overexpressing E2F1 underwent apoptosis, which was antagonized by co-expression of necdin (Fig. 7). These findings suggest that necdin plays a role in the suppression of E2F1 that promotes dedifferentiation and apoptosis during neuronal differentiation. On the other hand, E2F4 failed to affect necdin-induced growth arrest of N1E-115 cells (Fig.5 B), but promoted their neuronal differentiation (Fig.6 C). It has previously been reported that E2F4 actively promotes neuronal differentiation of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells in a cell growth-independent manner (37Persengiev S.P. Kondova I.I. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6048-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, E2F4, unlike E2F1, may be a participant in differentiation of neuronal lineage-committed cells. We speculate that necdin and E2F4 have similar functions to promote neuronal differentiation, although the functional significance of the physical interactions between necdin and E2F4 remains to be elucidated. Neuronal lineage-committed cell lines derived from neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma show differentiated characteristics in response to a variety of chemical inducers. However, these cells re-enter the cell cycle upon removal of the inducers. Thus, growth arrest of differentiated neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma cells is believed to be reversible. On the contrary, postmitotic neurons, which are generated from neural stem cells, completely lose their ability to enter the cell cycle and survive in differentiated mature state. Because necdin is expressed in postmitotic neurons generated from neural stem cells, it is likely that necdin contributes to the blockade of cell cycle reentry of postmitotic neurons. This idea is also supported by the present findings that necdin suppresses the S phase entry (Fig. 5 B) and antagonizes E2F1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 7). These results suggest that necdin is a unique growth suppressor that blocks cell cycle reentry and promotes survival of postmitotic neurons. Further studies on the functions of necdin will provide insights into the mechanisms underlying terminal differentiation of postmitotic neurons. We thank Drs. H. Higashida, D. M. Livingston, M.

The starting point for the directed evolution was the glutaryl acylase from Pseudomonas SY-77. The gene fragment encoding the β-subunit was divided into five overlapping parts that were mutagenized separately using error-prone PCR. Mutants were selected in a leucine-deficient host using adipyl-leucine as the sole leucine source. In total, 24 out of 41 plate-selected mutants were found to have a significantly improved ratio of adipyl-7-ADCAversus glutaryl-7-ACA hydrolysis. Several mutations around the substrate-binding site were isolated, especially in two hot spot positions: residues Phe-375 and Asn-266. Five mutants were further characterized by determination of their Michaelis-Menten parameters. Strikingly, mutant SY-77N266H shows a nearly 10-fold improved catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) on adipyl-7-ADCA, resulting from a 50% increase in k cat and a 6-fold decrease in K m, without decreasing the catalytic efficiency on glutaryl-7-ACA. In contrast, the improved adipyl/glutaryl activity ratio of mutant SY-77F375L mainly is a consequence of a decreased catalytic efficiency toward glutaryl-7-ACA.

In contrast, the improved adipyl/glutaryl activity ratio of mutant SY-77F375L mainly is a consequence of a decreased catalytic efficiency toward glutaryl-7-ACA. These results are discussed in the light of a structural model of SY-77 glutaryl acylase. 7-aminocephalosporanic acid 7-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid adipyl-7-ADCA glutaryl-7-ACA error-prone PCR wild type minimal agar supplemented with adipyl-leucine minimal agar supplemented with glutaryl-leucine minimal agar supplemented withl-leucine minimal agar without leucine source hydrolysis rate of AD-7-ADCA/hydrolysis rate of GL-7-ACA Semisynthetic cephalosporins and penicillins are the most widely used antibiotics. All clinically important semisynthetic cephalosporins are made from 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA)1 or 7-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA). 7-ACA is derived from cephalosporin C (aminoadipyl-7-ACA), which is obtained by fermentation of the fungus Cephalosporium acremonium. Deacylation is performed either chemically or by a two-step enzymatic process using ad-amino acid oxidase and a glutaryl acylase. The latter enzyme can be found in several Pseudomonas andAcinetobacter species (1Aramori I. Fukagawa M. Tsumura M. Iwami M. Isogai T. Ono H. Ishitani Y. Kojo H. Kohsaka M. Ueda Y. Imanaka H. J.

Microbiol. 1993; 159: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 7-ADCA is produced from penicillin G made by Penicillium chrysogenum involving several polluting chemical steps followed by enzymatic deacylation by penicillin acylase (10Bruggink A. Roos E.C. de Vroom E. Organic Process Res. Dev. 1998; 2: 128-133Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar). A first step toward the introduction of a simplified, more environmentally friendly production of 7-ADCA was the development of a genetically modified P. chrysogenum that produces adipyl-7-ADCA (AD-7-ADCA) (11Crawford L. Stepan A.M. McAda P.C. Rambosek J.A. Conder M.J. Vinci V.A. Reeves C.D. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For the deacylation of this novel β-lactam, an adipyl acylase is needed. Since the presently identified acylases show little or no activity toward AD-7-ADCA, it is of interest to investigate whether a glutaryl acylase can be converted into an adipyl acylase. In the past few years, directed evolution has been successfully implemented in changing the substrate specificity of several enzymes (12Arnold F.H. Wintrode P.L. Miyazaki K. Gershenson A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 100-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 13Zhao H. Chockalingam K. Chen Z. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2002; 13: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), resulting in biocatalysts with novel activities. It has become clear that the success of a directed evolution experiment greatly depends on the availability of a good selective substrate, which unfortunately is absent for most bioconversions (12Arnold F.H. Wintrode P.L. Miyazaki K. Gershenson A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 100-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Artificial substrates that mimic one of the desired catalytic steps may be used for selection; however, it is not clear to what extent the resulting mutants will have lost activity on their natural substrate. Here we describe a strategy to evolve the glutaryl acylase ofPseudomonas SY-77 into an adipyl acylase with an improved activity toward AD-7-ADCA. The glutaryl acylase fromPseudomonas SY-77 has proven to be particularly suitable for developing an industrial process for deacylation (14Monti D. Carrea G. Riva S. Baldaro E. Frare G. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2000; 70: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The natural action of the enzyme seems to be directed at hydrolyzing diamino acids with a glutaryl side chain as judged from its high activity on glutaryl-7-A(D)CA. It appears that the enzyme also has a low activity on AD-7-ADCA but no activity on cephalosporin C (2Shibuya Y. Matsumoto K. Fujii T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1981; 45: 1561-1567Google Scholar). Since deacylation of β-lactam compounds cannot be used for a growth selection, we took advantage of the diamino hydrolyzing capability of the acylase by replacing the β-lactam moiety with leucine, a compound that can be selected for in a leucine-deficient Escherichia coli host strain (15Garcia J.L. Buesa J.M. J. Biotechnol. 1986; 3: 187-195Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this way, only enzymatic hydrolysis of adipyl-leucine allows for growth on minimal medium. To obtain the desired acylase variant, we have constructed five libraries of overlapping gene fragments of the β-subunit of SY-77 by error-prone PCR (epPCR) and used these libraries separately in the selection procedure. Transformants that prevailed in growth were further characterized and tested for their activity on GL-7-ACA and AD-7-ADCA. Mutants with an improved growth capability on the selection substrate also showed an improved activity toward the β-lactam substrate. Mutations were found to accumulate in the proximity of the substrate binding pocket. Frequent mutations were identified at positions Asn-266 and Phe-375. Crystallographic models have pointed at the role of Phe-375 in the determination of substrate specificity, whereas Asn-266 was not mentioned before. Strikingly, mutation N266H induces an 8-fold improved catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) on AD-7-ADCA. The results are discussed on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of SY-77 glutaryl acylase. The plasmid pMcSY-2 was constructed by the introduction of four silent mutations into pMcSY-77 (GenBankTM accession numberAF458663) (16Sio C.F. Riemens A.M. Laan van der J.M. Verhaert R.M.D. Quax W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4495-4504Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), resulting in four additional restriction sites in the gene encoding the SY-77 acylase. The plasmid pMcSY-2 and the leucine-deficient E. coli DH10B (Invitrogen) were used for the cloning of the libraries and the expression of the SY-77 acylase. The plasmid pMcSY-YH (16Sio C.F. Riemens A.M. Laan van der J.M. Verhaert R.M.D. Quax W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4495-4504Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control for the selection and screening procedure. This plasmid encodes a mutant acylase, carrying the mutation Y178H in the α-subunit, which has a 3 times better catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) than WT in the hydrolysis of AD-7-ADCA. Molecular DNA techniques were executed following standard protocols (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). The enzymes used for DNA manipulations were purchased from New England Biolabs and Invitrogen and applied according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Qiaprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). DNA was extracted from agarose gels using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Interesting multiple mutants found were separated in order to pinpoint the mutation responsible for the improved enzymatic activity. In case a suitable restriction site was available, this was used to separate the mutations. Otherwise, single mutants were made by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR. In both cases, the mutated parts of the genes were sequenced on both strands afterward. For the epPCR, the gene fragment encoding the β-subunit of the SY-77 acylase was divided into five partly overlapping regions using seven unique sites in the plasmid (Fig. 1). Each region was mutagenized by PCR amplification under error-prone conditions (18Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar). The concentration of Mg2+ and the annealing temperature that gave the highest PCR yield were used. Using these conditions, a pilot experiment on part I was performed in order to determine the mutation rate and distribution under different concentrations of Mn2+. The PCRs were performed in aliquots of 25 μl containing 1× PCR buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl), 2.5 or 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1–0.5 mmMnCl2, 0.2 mm dATP and dGTP, 1 mmdCTP and dTTP, 1 ng of pMcSY-2, 1.25 units of recombinantTaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and 0.3 μmeach primer. The following primers (from 5′ to 3′, including underlined restriction sites) were used: part I, tcgcatcgcccgggcgca and ctcgaagaccgggccatgga; part II, cgccggacttcgagatcta and gattggtgacccgcggca; part III, ccgctccagcgtccatggc and tgtagctggtgaactcgcgat; part IV, ggacgatctgccgcgggt and tcggctcgcgacacgcgtt; part V, gcggcgtgggattcgcgag and cagagcgcccggtaccgaaa. All PCRs were performed in a Mastercycler® gradient thermocycler (Eppendorf) using the following program: 3 min at 95 °C, 20 cycles of 45 s at 95 °C, 30 s at the annealing temperature, 45 s at 72 °C, and a final step of 10 min at 72 °C. PCR product and WT vector were subjected to a restriction reaction using the suitable enzymes followed by electrophoresis. After the product of the correct size was excised and purified, ligation was performed overnight at 4 °C using T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). 40 μl of ElectroMAX™ DH10B™ Cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with 1 μl of each mutant library, following the protocol of the manufacturer. A 0.1-cm cuvette was used in a Bio-Rad gene pulser unit, which was set at 1.8 kV, 25 microfarads, 200 ohms. A small aliquot of the transformation mixture was plated onto LB agar containing 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 0.4% glucose to determine the transformation efficiency. The rest of the transformation mixture was shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen in 10% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. Of each library, 20 clones were picked randomly for the analysis of the mutational efficiency. Cells were slowly thawed on ice and washed twice with 0.9% NaCl. They were starved by incubation in 0.9% NaCl for 2 h at 37 °C and plated onto selective minimal medium plates AD-Leu (M9; 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 0.1% glycerol, and as a sole leucine source 0.1 mg/ml adipyl-leucine; LGSS Transferbureau Nijmegen, The Netherlands). Approximately 5000 viableE. coli DH10B cells containing the mutant plasmids were spread onto each plate. Of each library, a total of 105transformants was plated. Cells were also plated onto control plates: GL-Leu (0.248 mg/ml glutaryl-leucine·2DCHA; Bachem), MLeu (0.04 mg/mll-leucine; Sigma), and Min (no leucine at all). As a “positive” and a “negative” control, E. coli DH10B cells producing SY-77Y178H and SY-77 WT, respectively, were used. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for at least 10 days. Every day new appearing colonies were marked. Colonies were selected on the basis of their date of appearance and size and streaked again on AD-Leu plates to ensure that unique colonies were obtained. Single colonies from these second plates were used to inoculate an overnight culture to determine acylase activity and to isolate plasmid DNA for sequence determination. 10 ml of LB containing 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 0.1% glycerol was inoculated with 0.1 ml of an overnight culture and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. Cells were harvested (20 min, 3500 rpm) and incubated for 45 min in one-fifth volume of BugBuster (Novagen) at 20 °C while vigorously shaking. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (30 min, 13,000 rpm), and cell-free extracts were stored at −20 °C. Enzyme activities were determined on GL-7-ACA and AD-7-ADCA using the fluorescamine assay (19Reyes F. Martinez M.J. Soliveri J. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1989; 41: 136-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) in a 96-well format. All pipetting steps were performed by a Multiprobe II (Canberra Packard). 8 μl of cell free extract was mixed with 92 μl of 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and preheated at 37 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of 100 μl of substrate in phosphate buffer, with a final concentration of 2 mm GL-7-ACA or 5 mmAD-7-ADCA. After 60- and 120-min incubation at 37 °C, an aliquot of 40 μl of reaction mixture was transferred to 140 μl of 0.5m acetate buffer, pH 4.5, after which 20 μl of 1 mg/ml fluorescamine in acetone was added. After a 60-min incubation at room temperature, the A 380 was measured. Reaction mixtures without substrate or cell-free extract were used to correct for absorption of the different reaction mixture components at 380 nm. Activities are given as the ratio between the hydrolysis of AD-7-ADCA and GL-7-ACA (AD/GL) to account for variations in acylase concentration in the cell-free extracts. The ratios were determined after 60 and 120 min of incubation. Values were accepted if they were consistent, and the average of these two ratios was used in further calculations. The mean and the S.D. of the ratio found in at least three independent measurements were calculated. Mutants with an AD/GL ratio of at least 150% of that of the WT SY-77 acylase were purified as described below. The kinetic parameters of these mutants were determined by measuring the initial rate of hydrolysis on a range of substrate concentrations with a fixed amount of enzyme using the Multiprobe II for all pipetting steps. 140 μl of 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, with substrate (0.06–2 mm GL-7-ACA or 0.2–10 mm AD-7-ADCA) was preheated at 37 °C. 40 μl of phosphate buffer containing an appropriate amount of purified enzyme was added, starting the reaction. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, 40 μl of 2.5 macetate buffer, pH 4.5, was added to stop the reaction. 20 μl of 1 mg/ml fluorescamine in acetone was added, and theA 380 was measured after a 60-min incubation at room temperature. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the experimental data from Eadie-Hofstee plots, and the mean and S.D. values of at least four independent measurements were calculated. Thek cat was calculated using the theoretical molecular mass of the mature enzyme, 75.9 kDa. Protein concentrations of the cell-free extracts and purified samples were determined using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) in a 96-well plate with bovine serum albumin as the reference protein. The cell-free extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). The 12.5% gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Identical samples were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with a polyclonal rabbit antibody againstPseudomonas SY-77 glutaryl acylase (Eurogentec S.A.) and subsequently with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. Bands corresponding to Pseudomonas SY-77 glutaryl acylase were colored with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Mutant and WT enzyme were purified by three chromatography steps on a Duoflow system (Bio-Rad) using columns from Amersham Biosciences.E. coli DH10B containing the plasmids encoding the desired enzymes were grown for 24 h at 30 °C in 300 ml of 2*YT medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 0.1% glycerol. Cell-free extract was made by sonication (10 min, output 4, 50% duty cycle on a Sonifier 250; Branson) and centrifugation (30 min at 14,000 rpm) and loaded onto a HiTrapQ column. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.8. After analysis on SDS-PAGE, the fractions containing the enzyme were loaded onto a HiTrap phenyl-Sepharose HP column. The protein was eluted with a gradient of 0.7–0 m(NH4)2SO4. The pooled fractions containing the enzyme were desalted on a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column and reloaded onto a HiTrapQ column. After rinsing with 220 mm NaCl, the protein was eluted with 330 mmNaCl. The pooled fractions were stored at −20 °C. Typical yields were 10 mg of more than 90% pure enzyme per liter of culture. The conditions for the construction of the libraries were optimized. The highest PCR yields were obtained using 2.5 mm Mg2+ and an annealing temperature of 60 °C for parts I, III, and V and 5 mm Mg2+ and 66 °C for parts II and IV. Part I was subsequently mutagenized in the presence of 0.1–0.5 mm Mn2+. A Mn2+ concentration of 0.5 mm resulted in the desired mutation frequency of 0.7%, corresponding to ∼3 base pair mutations/mutant. Since the relatively high GC content (67%) is equally distributed throughout the gene, we used 0.5 mm Mn2+ to mutagenize all parts. epPCR gave a band of the correct size on an agarose gel for all five parts. Although both vector and insert were isolated from an agarose gel, cloning of the epPCR fragments into pMcSY-2 resulted in a significant part of contamination of parts II, III, and V with WT sequences. Sequencing of at least 400 base pairs of 20 randomly picked clones from each bank revealed that all mutations were equally distributed throughout the gene (Fig. 2). The mutational frequency of the different libraries varied from 0.2% for parts III and V to 0.7% for part I, resulting in 1–3 base pair mutations per mutant. The mutational bias was comparable with experiments under similar error-prone conditions as described before (21Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 3: S136-S140Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), although X → C (X ≠ C) changes were lower than expected. Since the transformation efficiency was not uniform for all five parts and plating of an equal amount of mutants onto each plate was desired, different volumes of the original transformation mixture were plated. All five libraries appeared to contain at least 105transformants, which is enough to harbor every single mutant at least once (22Griffiths A.D. Tawfik D.S. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 338-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Transformation mixtures were plated onto minimal plates in the absence of leucine (Min) or in the presence of leucine (MLeu), adipyl-leucine (AD-Leu), or glutaryl-leucine (GL-Leu). On each plate 5000 mutant plasmid-bearing bacteria were plated. As a reference,E. coli DH10B cells producing SY-77 WT and SY-77Y178H were used. Plates were examined every day, and colonies were marked and closely watched during the next days. After 3–4 days, small colonies appeared on all plates, the ones on Min and AD-Leu plates being somewhat smaller than those on MLeu and GL-Leu plates. On the Min plates, the spots did not grow upon further incubation, whereas colonies on the MLeu and GL-Leu plates increased in size until the 10th day. On the AD-Leu plates, colonies of the positive mutant producing SY-77Y178H increased in size until the 6th day, whereas the wild type strain colonies grew slowly but steadily until the 10th day. Colonies of the libraries grew at different rates. On the 10th day, a range of small and large colonies was present on each plate containing leucine of any kind. The average size of the colonies on the AD-Leu plates from E. coli DH10B containing the library parts IV and V or the negative control pMcSY-2 was smaller than the average size of the colonies from the other mutant libraries and the bacteria bearing the positive mutant plasmid pMcSY-YH. The size and day of appearance were used as criteria to select colonies of every epPCR part. These colonies were again streaked onto AD-Leu plates to isolate single colonies. Colonies of cells producing SY-77 WT and SY-77Y178H were also plated onto this medium. Most colonies were selected from the plates of parts I and II. Of the 54 colonies picked, 50 grew on the second AD-Leu plate after 5 days. Plasmid DNA was isolated from overnight cultures of the putative mutants from the secondary plate and retransformed to E. coli DH10B. DNA sequence determination of these plasmids showed that eight plasmids had the wild type sequence. Furthermore, some mutants proved to have identical sequences, leaving 29 unique transformants with mutations throughout the whole gene. However, most mutations occurred in the first 200 amino acids of the β-subunit, which corresponds to the fact that most mutants were selected from the libraries of parts I and II, encoding the first 230 amino acids. A 24-h culture of every mutant was harvested, and cell-free extracts were made using BugBuster. Hydrolysis of both AD-7-ADCA and GL-7-ACA were measured in triplicate in a medium throughput robotic assay. Several precautions were taken in order to maintain the reliability of the assay. To compensate for differences in acylase concentration in the cell-free extracts, the ratio AD/GL was used to characterize the mutants. Furthermore, all measurements were done using the same amount of cell-free extract, even those with lower protein concentrations, since BugBuster appeared to affect the hydrolysis of the adipyl substrate more than the glutaryl substrate. In some cases, this led to very low A 380 values that did not differ significantly from the blank values. In all cases, the production of acylase was verified by blotting the cell-free extract (data not shown). Some bacteria proved to produce no acylase at all, whereas other bacteria produced about 3 times less acylase, resulting in such a low enzyme activity that the ratio was not determinable.

Open table in a new tab Mutants of the five epPCR libraries were selected on minimal medium with adipyl-leucine as the sole leucine source. DNA sequences of these selected mutants were determined. Furthermore, cell-free extracts were made using BugBuster (Novagen).

All selected transformants from part V appeared to have WT sequence. Multiple mutants were genetically separated, and both DNA sequence and AD/GL ratio were determined. The results from Table I strongly suggest that Asn-266 is an important residue for substrate specificity. 22 of the 36 selected and sequenced transformants from parts I and II contain a mutation at this position. The two single mutants N266H and N266S have an AD/GL ratio of 0.19 and 0.14, respectively. Multiple mutants that were found comprising these mutations show the same ratio, implying that the additional mutations do not affect the substrate specificity. Although much less frequently found, mutation F375L results in the best AD/GL ratio found in these epPCR libraries. It has a 5 times better ratio than the wild type enzyme and even a 2 times better ratio than our positive control SY-77Y178H (16Sio C.F. Riemens A.M. Laan van der J.M. Verhaert R.M.D. Quax W.J. Eur.

Other clones having an improved AD/GL ratio are the single mutants and SY-77A246V and SY-77M347L and the multiple mutants SY-77F229L/V237A, SY-77S223P/M271L, and SY-77M271V/Q291K/T374S. We genetically separated the multiple mutants and measured the AD/GL activity ratio of the resulting mutants in order to pinpoint the mutation that contributes most to the altered activity. The results as shown in Table I show that the single mutants SY-77F229Land SY-77M271L alone give the same activity ratio as their respective double mutants. This suggests that the second mutations have no effect on the activity of the mutants. Sepa"
https://openalex.org/W2010338458,"Abstract The CWH8 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown recently (Fernandez, F., Rush, J. S., Toke, D. A., Han, G., Quinn, J. E., Carman, G. M., Choi, J.-Y., Voelker, D. R., Aebi, M., and Waechter, C. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 41455–41464) to encode a dolichyl pyrophosphate (Dol-P-P) phosphatase associated with crude microsomal fractions. Mutations in CWH8 result in the accumulation of Dol-P-P, deficiency in lipid intermediate synthesis, defective protein N-glycosylation, and a reduced growth rate. A cDNA (DOLPP1, GenBankTMaccession number AB030189) from mouse brain encoding a homologue of the yeast CWH8 gene is now shown to complement the defects in growth and protein N-glycosylation, and to correct the accumulation of Dol-P-P in the cwh8Δ yeast mutant. Northern blot analyses demonstrate a wide distribution of theDOLPP1 mRNA in mouse tissues. Overexpression of Dolpp1p in yeast, COS, and Sf9 cells produces substantial increases in Dol-P-P phosphatase activity but not in dolichyl monophosphate or phosphatidic acid phosphatase activities in microsomal fractions. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence studies localize the enzyme encoded by DOLPP1 to the endoplasmic reticulum of COS cells. The results of protease sensitivity studies with microsomal vesicles from the lpp1Δ/dpp1Δ yeast mutant expressing DOLPP1 are consistent with Dolpp1p having a luminally oriented active site. The sequence of the DOLPP1cDNA predicts a polypeptide with 238 amino acids, and a new polypeptide corresponding to 27 kDa is observed when DOLPP1is expressed in yeast, COS, and Sf9 cells. This study is the first identification and characterization of a cDNA clone encoding an essential component of a mammalian lipid pyrophosphate phosphatase that is highly specific for Dol-P-P. The specificity, subcellular location, and topological orientation of the active site described in the current study strongly support a role for Dolpp1p in the recycling of Dol-P-P discharged during protein N-glycosylation reactions on the luminal leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2015871535,"Munc18b is a mammalian Sec1-related protein that is abundant in epithelial cells and regulates vesicle transport to the apical plasma membrane. We constructed a homology model of Munc18b in complex with syntaxin 3 based on the crystal structure of the neuronal Sec1·syntaxin 1A complex. In this model we identified all residues in the interface between the two proteins that contribute directly to the interaction and mutagenized residues in Munc18b to alter its binding to syntaxins 1A, 2, and 3. The syntaxin-binding properties of the mutants were tested using an in vitroassay and by a co-immunoprecipitation approach employing Munc18b expressed in CHO-K1 cells. Three Munc18b variants, W28S, S42K, and E59K, were generated that are defective in binding to all three syntaxins. A fourth mutant protein, S48D, shows abolishment of syntaxin 3 interaction but binds syntaxin 2 at normal and syntaxin 1A at mildly reduced efficiency. Over-expression of Munc18b S48D inhibited transport of influenza hemagglutinin to the apical surface of Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells, which express syntaxin 2 abundantly, but not of Caco-2 cells, in which syntaxin 3 is the major apical target SNARE (soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor) attachment protein receptors). This suggests that, although syntaxin 3 is the main target SNARE operating in exocytic transport to the apical plasma membrane in certain epithelial cell types, syntaxin 2 may play an important role in this trafficking route in others. Munc18b is a mammalian Sec1-related protein that is abundant in epithelial cells and regulates vesicle transport to the apical plasma membrane.

Intracellular membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells employs vesicular carriers that bud from one membrane compartment and fuse with another. This process is dependent on compartment-specific membrane-anchored proteins denoted collectively as SNAREs 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor) attachment protein receptor; t-SNARE, target SNARE; syn, syntaxin; GST, glutathione-S-tranferase; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; SFV, Semliki Forest virus; SM protein, Sec1/Munc18 protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; MDCK II, Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells; wt, wild-type (soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor) attachment protein receptors) (1Jahn R.

The SNARE proteins present on the transport vesicles (v-SNAREs; related to the neuronal synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane proteins) and the target membranes (t-SNAREs; homologues of the neuronal syntaxin (syn) and SNAP-25 proteins) are characterized by the presence of one or two “SNARE motifs,” sequences capable of forming coiled-coil helix bundles upon assembly of v- and t-SNAREs into membrane-bridging complexes (called trans-SNARE complexes). Assembly of such trans-SNARE complexes results in a close apposition of the vesicle and target membranes and is suggested to indirectly or directly cause fusion of the membrane bilayers (4Weber T.

A given SM protein typically interacts with more than one syntaxin. The function of the mammalian Munc18 proteins (see below) involves contacts with both the Habc and the H3 regions of syntaxins (16Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H.

In vitro binding studies and over-expression of SM proteins have provided evidence for an inhibitory role of the proteins in SNARE complex formation and membrane trafficking.

Loss-of-function mutations in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster SM proteins lead to specific blocks in vesicle transport, and synaptic transmission was reported to be entirely absent in mice lacking the neuronal Sec1/Munc18a gene (19Verhage M.

We recently showed that Munc18b, through its interaction with syntaxin 3, regulates biosynthetic transport to the apical plasma membrane in the epithelial Caco-2 cell line (34Riento K. Kauppi M.

In the present study we employed the three-dimensional structure of a complex between the neuronal Munc18a and syntaxin 1A (17Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) for molecular modeling of the Munc18b·syn3 complex. We used the model to identify residues in Munc18b that are essential for syntaxin interactions in general and ones that are predicted to contribute to the specificity of syntaxin binding. The residues were mutagenized, and the effects of the amino acid changes on Munc18b binding to different syntaxins were determinedin vitro and in transfected cells. We succeeded in generating a mutant Munc18b (S48D) that binds at normal efficiency to syn2 but fails to interact with syn3. This mutant was then expressed in two epithelial cell lines, Caco-2 and MDCK II, which have different relative expression levels of syn2 and syn3, to assess the role of the two syntaxins in the transport of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) to the apical cell surface. A homology model of MDCK II cell (dog) Munc18b (GenBankTMaccession no. L41609) in complex with rat syntaxin 3 (GenBankTM accession no.

Manual adjustment of the position of three gaps in the alignment was performed in non-interacting regions of the proteins. Loop regions were built with the BRAGI program (36Schomburg D. Reichelt J.

The human colon carcinoma cell line (Caco-2) was cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-K1) and Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line (MDCK, strain II) were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The porcine kidney cell line LLC-PK1 was cultured in Medium 199 (Sigma) with Earle's salt supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For immunofluorescence studies Caco-2 and MDCK II cells were grown on Costar Transwell polycarbonate filters. Fresh medium was changed to the filters every day, and the polarized cells were used 7 days after reaching confluency or 5 days after transfection in suspension and plating at 100% confluency. The rabbit antiserum against Munc18b and the affinity purified anti-syn3 antibody have been characterized (25Riento K. Galli T. Jansson S. Ehnholm C. Lehtonen E. Olkkonen V.M. J.

The polyclonal antiserum against influenza virus A H1N1 envelope glycoproteins was a gift from Dr. Ilkka Julkunen (National Public Health Institute, Helsinki, Finland). The amino-terminallymyc-tagged canine Munc18b cDNA in pBluescript SK(−) was mutagenized using the QuikChange system (Stratagene). The sequence changes were verified using a cycle-sequencing kit (BIGDYE) and an automated ABI377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Amino-terminallymyc-tagged wild-type and mutant Munc18b cDNAs were transferred as BamHI fragments from pBluescript SK(−) to pcDNA3.1(+)(Invitrogen) for transfection experiments. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient expression of full-length mouse syn2A or rat syn3A cDNAs in pBK-CMV (Stratagene) was achieved by transfection of trypsinized Caco-2 or MDCK II cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), followed by culture of the cells on polycarbonate filters for 5–6 days. cDNA fragments encoding the amino-terminal cytoplasmic domains of rat syntaxins 1A (GenBank™ accession no.

One μg/well of GST, GST-syn1A, GST-syn2, GST-syn3, or GST-syn4 in 50 mm NaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.6, was coated on MaxiSorb 96-well plates (Nunc) for 16 h at +4 °C. The binding of [35S]methionine labeled in vitro translated Munc18b to the immobilized GST-syntaxin fusion proteins was assayed essentially as in (34Riento K. Kauppi M. Keränen S. Olkkonen V.M. J.

CHO-K1 cells were grown on 3.5 cm dishes and transfected with Munc18b wild-type or mutant constructs for 24 h. The cells were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine (AmershamBiosciences, AG0080; 30 μCi/dish) in Met- and Cys-free cell culture medium containing 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 1 h. After PBS washes the cells were either lysed directly in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (10 mm Hepes, 1% Triton X-100, 140 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 25 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A) or chased for 2 h with excess unlabeled Met and Cys. The myc-Munc18b proteins were immunoprecipitated by using the 9E10 anti-mycmAb and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. CHO-K1 cells were grown on 3.5 cm dishes and, after 24 h transfection with myc-Munc18b wt or mutant constructs, lysed in the above IP buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-myc mAb. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-syn2, anti-syn3, or anti-Munc18b antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). The filter-grown cells were fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde, 250 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and permeabilized for 20 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The primary antibodies diluted in 5% fetal calf serum/PBS were incubated with the specimens overnight at 4 °C. The filters were washed with PBS on a shaker. The bound antibodies were detected with fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)- or tetramethylrhodamine-isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse F(ab′)2 (Immunotech, Marseille, France). After extensive washes with PBS the specimens were mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem), 50 μg/ml 1,4 diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane (Sigma), and investigated using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica SP1). Recombinant SFVs expressing wt Munc18b, the S48D mutant, or human CLN3 (the control virus) and influenza virus WSN/33 hemagglutinin from two independent 26 S promoters were constructed using the strategy of (42Suomalainen M.

After the infection period the filter units were returned into complete medium and incubated at +37 °C in the presence of cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) to chase the expressed HA to the cell surface. Caco-2 cells were infected for 5 h and then chased for 4 h. For MDCK II the times were 7 h and 2 h, respectively. Cells infected with recombinant SFVs as above were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as decribed above and inspected with a Leica SP1 confocal microscope. The distribution of HA on the basal-apical axis was quantified in single infected cells with the Quantify function of the Leica confocal software by determining the mean fluorescence intensity at four z planes, the apical and basal surfaces plus two intermediate planes at equal intervals. In the present study we generated, based on the published crystal structure of a complex of their neuronal homologues nSec1-Munc18a and syntaxin 1A (17Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), a homology model of the Munc18b·syntaxin 3 complex (Fig.1). The overall sequence identity between Munc18a and Munc18b is 63%, the identity of syn1a and syn3 being 65%. The model shows only minor differences to the structure of the Munc18a·syn1a complex. All backbone deviations above 1 Å, with the exception of His-328 in Munc18b, are located in areas distant from the binding interface between the two proteins. The quality of the model minimized with a di-electricity constant of 4r was the best according to PROCHECK and ERRAT results. Consequently this model was used for planning mutants and further structural analysis. The program CONTACTS (55Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Cryst. 1994; D50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) was used to identify all residues in the interface between Munc18b and syn3 in our model that are in close proximity to atoms of the binding partner (< 4 Å). Multiple sequence alignment of the syntaxin family was used to analyze the conservation of interacting residues (Fig.2). Their potential interaction partners in Munc18b were inspected in the structural model to see if they could be changed to amino acids, which would alter the binding of Munc18b to syntaxins, to (i) validate the model and (ii) to create Munc18b mutants with altered syntaxin-binding properties for functional studies. It is noteworthy here that the residues of Munc18b found to interact with syn3 are all fully conserved between mammalian species (rat, mouse, dog, human) (data not shown). To disable binding to all syntaxins, a highly conserved hydrophobic interaction with F36 in syn3 (Fig. 2) was removed in the mutant W28S. Glu-59 was changed to the oppositely charged lysine to create a repulsive interaction with Arg-114, which is also conserved in all syntaxins (Fig. 2). Additionally, we identified by sequence comparison those interacting residues that are not conserved in different syntaxins (Fig. 2). This information in combination with the structural model was used in efforts to disable Munc18b binding only to certain syntaxins. The variant S42K was intended to bind only syn2 and syn3 due to favorite interactions with Asn-233 in syn2 or Asn-231 in syn3, whereas the corresponding residue is arginine in syn1A, which is expected to prevent binding. The mutant S48D was predicted to interact only with syn2. S48D was expected to show reduced affinity for syn1A and syn3 because of a repulsion of the like charges of Asp-48 and Asp-231 in syn1A and Asp-230 in syn3. Syn2 binding should still be possible because of a more favorable interaction between Asn-48 in the mutant Munc18b and Asn-232 in the syntaxin. To analyze the interaction of the Munc18b mutant proteins with different plasma membrane syntaxins we used a previously published (34Riento K. Kauppi M. Keränen S. Olkkonen V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13476-13483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in vitro binding assay. This method was developed further to increase its sensitivity. In vitrotranslated [35S]methionine-labeled Munc18b or its variants were incubated on GST-syntaxin 1A, 2, 3, 4, or GST-coated 96-well plates, and the bound radioactivity was measured. Radioactivity bound to plain GST was used as background, which was subtracted from the GST-syntaxin-bound signal. The wild-type Munc18b showed most efficient binding to syn2, followed by syn3. Binding to syn1A was also clearly detectable, whereas no binding to syn4 was observed (Fig.3 A). The assay gave a linear response to the amount of radioactive Munc18b added in the concentration range tested. In a previous study (34Riento K. Kauppi M. Keränen S. Olkkonen V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13476-13483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) we reported a Munc18b double mutant K314L/R315L that did not show significant binding to syn3. We investigated further the binding of K314L/R315L to syntaxins. With the more sensitive assay modification presently in use, binding of the mutant to syn3 was detectable even though the binding efficiency was low. The K314L/R315L mutant also showed markedly reduced but detectable affinity to syn1A and syn2. The new Munc18b mutants W28S and E59K were designed to block all interactions with syntaxins 1A, 2, and 3. The behavior of these mutated proteins in the in vitro binding assay was as expected. Also, the binding of S42K to all syntaxins was inhibited even though the mutation was originally designed to prevent only the interaction with syn1A. The S48D mutant was designed to selectively bind syn2. In the in vitro assay S48D showed normal binding to syn2 and reduced affinity to syn1A. Remarkably, the binding to syn3 was completely abolished. Neither the wt Munc18b nor the mutants detectably bound syn4 (Fig. 3 B). The results of the in vitro binding assay were verified in terms of the syn2 and syn3 interactions by expressing the Munc18b variants in CHO-K1 cells, which were found to express both syn2 and syn3. First, the stability of the mutated proteins was tested by using a pulse-chase approach. The CHO cells were transiently transfected with myc-Munc18b constructs. After 24 h the cells were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine and lysed directly after pulse or after a 2 h chase. The myc-Munc18b in the lysates was immunoprecipitated with myc-antibody, and the precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The stability of the mutated proteins (K314L/R315L, W28S, S42K, S48D, and E59K) did not differ from that of the wt Munc18b. After the chase period no degradation or major loss of the labeled Munc18b was observed (Fig.4). For testing the Munc18b-syn2 and -syn3 interactions in vivothe CHO cells were transfected with wt or mutant myc-Munc18b constructs and immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody. The precipitates were analyzed with anti-Munc18b, anti-syn2, and anti-syn3 antibodies (Fig 5). The wt Munc18b was found to bind to both syn2 and syn3. In contrast, the S48D mutant bound only to syn2. Weak binding to syn2 was also observed with the K314L/R315L double mutant. The other mutants, W28S, S42K, and E59K, were found to bind neither of the syntaxins. The expression of the Munc18b variants was verified by Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates with anti-Munc18b antibody. All of the variants were present in similar amounts in the precipitated specimens. The results of these in vivo binding experiments were thus remarkably similar to the in vitro findings. Because Munc18b S48D failed to bind syn3 but bound syn2 with normal efficiency it was regarded as highly interesting. The structural basis of the selectivity of S48D for syn2 is depicted in Fig. 6. S48D shows reduced affinity for syn3 because of repulsion of the like charges of Asp-48 in the mutant Munc18b and Asp-230 in syn3. Syn2 binding is still possible because of a favorite interaction between Asp-48 in Munc18b and Asn-232 in syn2, which corresponds to Asp-230 in syn3. Other potential interaction partners for Ser/Asp-48 are Lys-126, which is conserved between the different syntaxins, and Val-122, which is replaced by threonine in syn1A. The threonine could form a hydrogen bond with the newly introduced Asp-48 in the Munc18b mutant,"

Nuclear receptors are ligand-modulated transcription factors that respond to steroids, retinoids, and thyroid hormones to control development and body physiology. Orphan nuclear receptors possess apparent DNA and ligand-binding domains but lack identified ligands (1Blumberg B. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 2Willy P.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. O'Malley B.W. Hormones and Signaling, Volume 1.

Each orphan has the potential to regulate a distinct signaling pathway. The promise of orphan receptors is that the identification of novel and perhaps unsuspected classes of ligands may offer insight into potentially new principles of development and physiology. In recent years, a number of orphan receptors have been adopted or matched with physiological ligands (3Kliewer S.A. Lehmann J.M. Willson T.M.

Consequently, new insights into cholesterol and bile acid metabolism and transport (4Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar) have been gained. Previously, we identified a Xenopus orphan nuclear receptor that represented a distinct branch of the nuclear receptor superfamily and named it benzoate “X” receptor (BXR) 1The abbreviations used are: BXR, benzoate X receptor; SXR, steroid and xenobiotic receptor; PXR, pregnane X receptor; 4-ABB, 4-amino-butylbenzoate; 4-HBB, 4-hydroxy-butylbenzoate; 3-HEB, 3-hydroxy ethyl benzoate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT, reverse transcription; ABC, ATB-binding cassette; PBP, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-binding protein; luc, luciferase; DBD, DNA-binding domain 1The abbreviations used are: BXR, benzoate X receptor; SXR, steroid and xenobiotic receptor; PXR, pregnane X receptor; 4-ABB, 4-amino-butylbenzoate; 4-HBB, 4-hydroxy-butylbenzoate; 3-HEB, 3-hydroxy ethyl benzoate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT, reverse transcription; ABC, ATB-binding cassette; PBP, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-binding protein; luc, luciferase; DBD, DNA-binding domain(5Blumberg B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)). The name reflects its activation by alkyl esters of amino and hydroxyl benzoic acids, one of which is found endogenously in theXenopus embryo (5Blumberg B. Kang H. Bolado Jr., J. Chen H. Craig A.G. Moreno T.A. Umesono K. Perlmann T., De Robertis E.M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The identification of BXR as a receptor for benzoate ligands illustrates the potential of uncovering previously unsuspected signaling pathways through orphan receptor characterization. Recently, a second Xenopus BXR cDNA was described (7Nishikawa J. Saito K. Sasaki M. Tomigahara Y. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This BXR shares only 88% nucleic acid sequence identity and 83% amino acid sequence identity (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 7Nishikawa J. Saito K. Sasaki M. Tomigahara Y. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with the BXR we characterized previously (5Blumberg B. Kang H. Bolado Jr., J. Chen H. Craig A.G. Moreno T.A. Umesono K. Perlmann T., De Robertis E.M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, the two receptors have been designated as BXRα and BXRβ (7Nishikawa J. Saito K. Sasaki M. Tomigahara Y. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). BXR is most closely related to the human steroid and xenobiotic receptor, SXR (8Blumberg B. Sabbagh W. Juguilon H. Bolado Jr., J. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) (also known as pregnane X receptor, PXR (9Kliewer S.A. Moore J.T. Wade L. Staudinger J.L.

SXR and its rodent ortholog PXR function as xenobiotic sensors in the liver and intestine. They mediate the breakdown and elimination of steroids, drugs, and xenobiotic compounds by activating the expression of degradative cytochrome P450 enzymes and members of the ABC family of organic molecule transporters. BXR and SXR/PXR have been assigned to the NR1I2 family by the Nuclear Receptor Nomenclature Committee (11Nuclear Receptor Nomenclature Committee Cell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). This indicates that these receptors are orthologous, i.e. the same gene from different species. During our characterization of SXR, we noted that none of the compounds that activated SXR was able to activate BXRα (8Blumberg B. Sabbagh W. Juguilon H. Bolado Jr., J. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). 2B. Blumberg, unpublished observations. 2B. Blumberg, unpublished observations. This led us to question whether BXR and SXR are functionally equivalent,i.e. do BXRs function as xenobiotic sensors? As described below, we found that neither BXRα nor BXRβ is activated by the types of xenobiotic compounds that activate SXR/PXR. In addition, BXRs are ubiquitously expressed at varying levels in different tissues rather than showing the high level expression only in the liver and intestine characteristic of SXR/PXR. We infer that BXRs are unlikely to be functioning as xenobiotic sensors and are therefore functionally distinct from their mammalian relatives. Lastly, we show that BXRβ is activated only by 4-hydroxyl benzoates as compared with BXRα, which can also be activated by other related compounds including amino benzoates, benzyl benzoate, chlorpyrifos, and trifluralin. Interestingly, several of the BXRα-selective activators function as antagonists for BXRβ, thus suggesting that the two BXRs are also pharmacologically distinct from each other. COS-7 cells were cultured in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. For transient transfection experiments, COS-7 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 5000 cells/well. 4–5 h after seeding, the cells were transfected with CMX-GAL4-xBXRα (5Blumberg B. Kang H. Bolado Jr., J. Chen H. Craig A.G. Moreno T.A. Umesono K. Perlmann T., De Robertis E.M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), CMX-GAL4-xBXRβ, or CMX-GAL4 (control) together with tk(MH100)4-luc reporter (12Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) and CMX-β-galactosidase transfection control plasmids using standard calcium phosphate precipitation methodology. 22–24 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2 or DMEM-ITLB (DMEM containing 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml holo-transferrin, 5 μg/ml selenium, 0.5% defined lipid mix (Invitrogen), 0.12% w/v delipidated bovine serum albumin (Sigma)) (13Buck J. Grün F. Derguini F. Chen Y. Kimura S. Noy N. Hammerling U. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Ligands were next added in DMEM-ITLB, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24–48 h. Ligands were typically purchased from Sigma, ChemService (West Chester, PA), or Roche Molecular Biochemicals and made freshly from powder in Me2SO as 0.1m stocks, diluted in Me2SO to appropriate concentrations and added to media with vigorous vortex mixing. The cells were incubated with ligands for 24–48 h and then lysed in situ. Extracts were prepared and assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activity as described (8Blumberg B. Sabbagh W. Juguilon H. Bolado Jr., J. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Reporter gene activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase transfection controls, and the results were expressed as normalized relative luciferase units per OD of β-galactosidase per minute to facilitate comparisons between plates. Fold induction was calculated relative to solvent controls. Each data point represents the average of triplicate experiments ± S.E. and was replicated in independent experiments. Tissues were obtained from adultXenopus laevis males and females, dissected into small pieces, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was isolated from the tissues using standard guanidine thiocyanate procedure (14Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16648) Google Scholar). Northern blots were performed using the ligand-binding domain of BXRα, BXRβ, or EF-1α according to standard methods (15Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). For RT-PCR analysis, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer-supplied protocol (Invitrogen). Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using the following primer sets: BXRa (5′-CTGTCCTGGTAGGGCAATGT-3′, 5′-AATGGGACTGAAGCAACGTC-3′), BXRb (5′-CAGCCGGTGAATTGTCTTCT-3′, 5′-AGTTGTGGGGCTTGATTTTG-3′), or EF1a (5′-CCTGAATCACCCAGGCCAGATTGGTG-3′, 5′-GAGGGTAGTCTGAGAAGCTCTCCACG-3′) using the SYBR green PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) in a DNA Engine Opticon continuous fluorescence detection system (MJ Research). All samples were quantitated by the comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method for relative quantitation of gene expression, normalized to EF-1α (16Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref Scopus (121088) Google Scholar). Xenopus BXRβ was isolated by RT-PCR based on the published sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF305201) (7Nishikawa J. Saito K. Sasaki M. Tomigahara Y. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 1 μg ofXenopus total RNA was primed with oligo(dT)12–18 and reverse-transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer-supplied protocol (Invitrogen). The cDNA was PCR-amplified usingPwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the specific primers (5′-TCCGTGCTCACCTGGTTCCGT-3′) and (5′-CCTATCCATGTAGGTATCCCAGAT-3′) that annealed in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of BXRβ. The amplified product was gel-purified, and the ligand-binding domain of BXRβ (amino acids 104–388) was amplified using nested primers (5′-TCGCCGGAATTCAGGAAAGAGCTGATCATGTCA-3′) and (5′-TGGCCAGGATCCCTATCACTCATTCAGGGATCC-3′). The resulting product was purified and ligated into pCMX-GAL4 to generate a GAL4-DBD-BXRβ-ligand-binding domain fusion protein. Similarly, GAL4 coactivator plasmids were generated by cloning the receptor interaction domains of human TIF2 (GenBank™ accession number NM006540, amino acids 563–790), human F-SRC-1 (GenBank™ accession number U59302, amino acids 600–800), or human ACTR (GenBank™ accession number AF036892, amino acids 600–788) into pCMX-GAL4. The GAL4-PBP construct was a gift from B. Forman (City of Hope Medical Center). To construct Herpesvirus VP16 activation domain fusion proteins, full-length BXRα and BXRβ were PCR-amplified and ligated in-frame into pCMX-VP16 vector. All constructs were sequenced to verify that no errors were introduced in the PCR. Recently, a second Xenopus BXR cDNA was described (7Nishikawa J. Saito K. Sasaki M. Tomigahara Y. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This BXR shares only 88% nucleic acid sequence identity and 83% amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 1A and Ref. 7Nishikawa J. Saito K. Sasaki M. Tomigahara Y. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with the BXR we characterized previously (5Blumberg B. Kang H. Bolado Jr., J. Chen H. Craig A.G. Moreno T.A. Umesono K. Perlmann T., De Robertis E.M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This is more than would be expected for the divergence between two duplicated genes in the pseudotetraploid X. laevis genome (17Hughes M.K. Hughes A.L. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 1360-1369PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the new receptor was called BXRβ (7Nishikawa J. Saito K. Sasaki M. Tomigahara Y. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the possible target tissues for BXR action, we examined the expression patterns of BXRα and BXRβ in adult frogs by Northern blot and quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis. Both genes encode ubiquitously expressed single transcripts of ∼3.2 kb (data not shown) and are found at very high levels in the ovary (Fig. 1 B). BXRα is expressed at high levels in the brain and skin with moderate levels in the testis, stomach, and intestines and lower levels in the lung, kidney, liver, and heart (Fig. 1 B). BXRβ is expressed at comparable levels to BXRα in the intestines, lung and kidney with slightly higher levels in the testis and heart and lower levels in the liver, skin and brain (Fig. 1 B). It is notable that these ubiquitous expression patterns for BXR differ considerably from those of its putative human ortholog, the steroid and xenobiotic receptor SXR (8Blumberg B. Sabbagh W. Juguilon H. Bolado Jr., J. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). SXR functions as a xenobiotic sensor and is expressed primarily in the liver and intestine, where it modulates the levels of cytochrome p450 enzymes and ABC family transporters (8Blumberg B. Sabbagh W. Juguilon H. Bolado Jr., J. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 9Kliewer S.A. Moore J.T. Wade L. Staudinger J.L.

Since BXRs are ubiquitously expressed, they do not show the tissue distribution expected for a xenobiotic sensor. Our previous work showed that alkyl esters of amino and hydroxyl benzoic acids specifically bind to and activate BXRα (5Blumberg B. Kang H. Bolado Jr., J. Chen H. Craig A.G. Moreno T.A. Umesono K. Perlmann T., De Robertis E.M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was surprising that BXRβ was reported to be activated only very weakly by 4-amino butyl benzoate (7Nishikawa J. Saito K. Sasaki M. Tomigahara Y. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which strongly activates BXRα (5Blumberg B. Kang H. Bolado Jr., J. Chen H. Craig A.G. Moreno T.A. Umesono K. Perlmann T., De Robertis E.M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We tested the activation profiles of these receptors to determine whether the two BXRs might exhibit different ligand specificity. BXRα and BXRβ were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, and then a panel of benzoates and related compounds was tested for their ability to activate transcription of a luciferase reporter gene (Fig.2). Activation of BXRα paralleled our published results (Fig. 2 A) in that both hydroxyl and amino benzoates were robust activators. In addition, we observed that benzyl benzoate, trifluralin, and chlorpyrifos also activated BXRα (Fig.2 A). In contrast, only 4-hydroxyl butyl benzoate was able to activate BXRβ (Fig. 2 B). It is particularly notable that 3-hydroxyl ethyl benzoate, which was identified as an endogenous embryonic activator of BXRα, could activate BXRα but was inactive on BXRβ (Fig. 2, A and B). BXRβ was considerably more active in response to ligand than was BXRα (Fig. 2,A and B). A similar trend was also observed in dose-response experiments (Fig. 2, C and D). BXRα was strongly activated by 10 μm 4-ABB, 4-HBB, chlorpyrifos, and trifluralin (Fig. 2 C). BXRβ was only activated by 4-HBB among the many compounds tested (Fig. 2,B and D). The activation of BXRβ was very robust with 50 μm of 4-HBB yielding between 50- and 100-fold activation of the reporter gene (Fig. 2, B andD). To confirm that BXRα and BXRβ show distinct pharmacological responses to ligand, we conducted co-activator recruitment studies to determine the ability and preferences of the various ligands to support the formation of specific active transcriptional complexes. This mammalian two-hybrid assay utilized VP16-BXRα and VP16-BXRβ together with fusions between the GAL4-DNA-binding domain and the receptor-interacting domain of the nuclear hormone receptor co-activators, TIF-2, ACTR, SRC-1, and PBP (18Dussault I. Lin M. Hollister K. Wang E.H. Synold T.W. Forman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33309-33312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) to investigate the ability of BXRα agonists to promote productive transcriptional interactions. VP16-BXRα was able to interact with all four co-activators in the presence of agonistic ligands (Fig. 3A). VP16-BXRα showed the strongest interaction with SRC-1 irrespective of the ligand tested (4-HBB, 12-fold; 4-ABB, 8-fold; chlorpyrifos and trifluralin 6-fold), although, a rank order of co-activator response could be identified (SRC-1 > TIF-2 > PBP = ACTR) (Fig.3 A). This is notably different from the rank order of potency of SXR for the same coactivators (SRC1 > PBP > TIF-2/GRIP > ACTR) (19Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Overall, the rank order of potency of compounds in the co-activator recruitment assay paralleled their potency in the activation assays (Fig. 2). Co-activator interaction with BXRβ was much more restricted in response to agonist (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with the dose-response experiments (Fig. 2 D), only 4-HBB possessed any strong ability to promote co-activator interaction. The response observed with SRC-1 was approximately equivalent to that seen with BXRα (10- versus 12-fold). The level of interaction with PBP was weaker (4-fold) although comparable with that seen with BXRα (Fig. 3 A). The activation responses with ACTR and TIF-2 were poor. The rank order was SRC-1 > PBP > ACTR = TIF-2. The data suggest that SRC-1 is a strong co-activator for both BXRα and BXRβ. BXRα is promiscuous both in its choice of ligand and in its choice of co-activator, whereas BXRβ is not promiscuous for either (Fig. 3). The observation that most BXRα activators could not activate BXRβ leads to two possible inferences. One is that the compounds specifically bind only to BXRα. In this case, we would not expect to discern any effect of these compounds on BXRβ activation. Alternatively, the compounds might bind to both receptors but only activate BXRα. In this scenario, the BXRα activators could act as antagonists for BXRβ. Accordingly, we conducted antagonism experiments using the BXRβ agonist 4-HBB and BXRα-specific agonists. Two types of experiments were employed. First, we tested the ability of BXRα-specific agonists to directly interfere with BXRβ-mediated activation. COS-7 cells were transfected with GAL4-BXRβ, and inhibitory dose-response curves were derived. Cells were treated with increasing doses of 4-ABB, chlorpyrifos, or trifluralin in the presence of a fixed series of agonist 4-HBB concentrations in the range of 1–50 μm. Transcriptional activation of BXRβ by 4-HBB alone gave a derived mean EC50 of 33 ± 3.2 μm (n= 4) (Table I). Titration with either chlorpyrifos or trifluralin resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of 4-HBB-mediated transcriptional activation of the reporter gene (Fig. 4A). In contrast, 4-ABB showed a small additive effect up to 10 μm and was inhibitory at 100 μm under these conditions (Fig. 4 A). Data were fitted by non-linear regression analysis, and inhibitory constants (K i) for BXRβ-mediated transcriptional activation were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (20Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12221) Google Scholar) and shown in Table I. Chlorpyrifos yielded a K i of 0.5 ± 0.2 μm (n = 13), trifluralin yielded aK i of 5.2 ± 0.8 μm(n = 8), and 4-ABB yielded a K i of >82 ± 9 μm (n = 15). By comparison with the EC50 value of 33 μm for 4-HBB on BXRβ, the data suggest that both chlorpyrifos and trifluralin can act as potent competitive antagonists of BXRβ activation, whereas 4-ABB demonstrates weaker antagonism on this receptor. 3-HEB did not antagonize the activation of BXRβ (data not shown).Table IBXRα agonists are BXRβ antagonistsCompoundEC50Kianμmμm4-HBB33 ± 3.2bEC50 for BXRβ activation by 4-HBB was determined from non-linear regression analysis of dose-response curves.44-ABB82 ± 915Chlorpyrifos0.5 ± 0.213Trifluralin5.2 ± 0.88aKi values were derived from inhibition curves at constant HBB concentrations in the range of 1–50 μm 4-HBB using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (20Cheng Y.

Values represent the mean ± S.E. calculated from the indicated number of inhibition curves (n).b EC50 for BXRβ activation by 4-HBB was determined from non-linear regression analysis of dose-response curves. Open table in a new tab aKi values were derived from inhibition curves at constant HBB concentrations in the range of 1–50 μm 4-HBB using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (20Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12221) Google Scholar). Values represent the mean ± S.E. calculated from the indicated number of inhibition curves (n). We next tested the ability of the BXRα-specific agonists to interfere with 4-HBB-mediated co-activator recruitment in the mammalian two-hybrid assay as described above. COS-7 cells were transfected with VP16-BXRβ, GAL-SRC1, and CMX-β-galactosidase and treated with 50 μm 4-HBB in combination with a dose series of 4-ABB, chlorpyrifos, trifluralin, or solvent controls. Fig. 4 Bshows that 4-ABB, chlorpyrifos, and trifluralin were each able to impair co-activator recruitment by 4-HBB. Therefore, we conclude that these BXRα-selective activators are able to act as antagonists for BXRβ, supporting the contention that BXRα and BXRβ are pharmacologically distinct from each other. The very different tissue distributions of BXRs and SXR/PXRs led us to suspect that these receptors might be functionally different. To test this hypothesis, we examined a panel of compounds for their ability to activate BXRα, BXRβ, and human SXR. We found that neither BXRα nor BXRβ was activated by any of the classic SXR/PXR activators (e.g. rifampicin, pregnenolone-16 α-carbonitrile, phenobarbitals, or clotrimazole) (Fig.5). The only xenobiotic compounds that activated BXRα, chlorpyrifos and trifluralin, have chemical structures similar to benzoates. We also evaluated other known SXR activators including steroids and bile acids for their ability to activate BXR. None of these SXR activators were able to activate BXRs (data not shown). We also note that two compounds reported previously to activate BXRβ, dexamethasone and methylprednisolone (7Nishikawa J. Saito K. Sasaki M. Tomigahara Y. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), do not activate either BXR in our experiments. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown at present but may relate either to the different experimental systems used or to the very low levels of activation originally observed (∼2-fold) (7Nishikawa J. Saito K. Sasaki M. Tomigahara Y. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Despite a flood of genomic and expressed sequence tag sequence information in recent years, there is still little information available that suggests a function for BXR or confirms its presence in animals other than X. laevis. The recent identification of BXRβ (7Nishikawa J. Saito K. Sasaki M. Tomigahara Y. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and its activation by 4-HBB (Figs. 2 and 3) suggests that both BXRs are receptors for endogenous hydroxyl benzoates or closely related compounds. This narrows the range of compounds expected to activate both BXRα and BXRβ to a relatively small group and suggests that a detailed focus on these structures will lead to the elucidation of endogenous ligands. It is particularly interesting that BXRα and BXRβ are pharmacologically distinct and that several potent BXRα activators are BXRβ antagonists. This means that treating early embryos with compounds such as 4-ABB would simultaneously activate BXRα while inhibiting the activity of BXRβ. This could explain why such treatments do not have obvious adverse effects on the embryos at subtoxic doses.2 To sort out the biology of the two receptor subtypes, it will be necessary to perform targeted loss-of-function experiments in early embryos using, for example, morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (21Heasman J. Kofron M. Wylie C. Dev. Biol. 2000; 222: 124-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 22Koide T. Downes M. Chandraratna R.A. Blumberg B. Umesono K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2111-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) coupled with phenotypic rescue experiments. The results presented in Fig. 2 show that both BXRs are robustly activated only by 4-hydroxyl benzoates, whereas BXRα is promiscuously activated by other benzoates and related compounds. This is notable because one of the endogenous benzoates found in Xenopusembryos, 3-HEB, is a BXRα−selective activator (5Blumberg B. Kang H. Bolado Jr., J. Chen H. Craig A.G. Moreno T.A. Umesono K. Perlmann T., De Robertis E.M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Although three endogenous benzoates remain to be identified inXenopus embryos, the total concentration of benzoate BXRα activators is 10 μm in the blastula stage embryo (5Blumberg B. Kang H. Bolado Jr., J. Chen H. Craig A.G. Moreno T.A. Umesono K. Perlmann T., De Robertis E.M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which is in the range required for receptor activation. In accord with our results, Moore et al. (23Moore L.B. Maglich J.M. McKee D.D. Wisely B. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Lambert M.H. Moore J.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) recently showed that BXRβ is robustly activated by 4-hydroxyl benzoates and noted, without comment, that BXRα is activated by amino benzoates, whereas BXRβ is not. In contrast to our findings, Nishikawa et al.(7Nishikawa J. Saito K. Sasaki M. Tomigahara Y. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) report only a 1.5-fold activation of BXRβ by 4-HBB. The reason for this difference is currently unknown but could result from different cell lines utilized in the different laboratories (COS-7versus HeLa). Alternatively, since bona fidetarget genes for BXR are unknown, the reporter construct used (7Nishikawa J. Saito K. Sasaki M. Tomigahara Y. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) might not be an effective target for BXRβ in vivo. We note that BXRα shows a strong preference for the sequence AGTTCAnnnnAGTTCA (5Blumberg B. Kang H. Bolado Jr., J. Chen H. Craig A.G. Moreno T.A. Umesono K. Perlmann T., De Robertis E.M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) as compared with the AGGTCAnnnnAGGTCA used by Nishikawa et al. (7Nishikawa J. Saito K. Sasaki M. Tomigahara Y. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (where n equals any nucleotide). BXRs are most closely related to the mammalian SXR/PXR gene family. Indeed, BXR was used as a probe to isolate human SXR (8Blumberg B. Sabbagh W. Juguilon H. Bolado Jr., J. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). BXR and SXR/PXR have been assigned to the NR1I2 family by the Nuclear Receptor Nomenclature Committee (11Nuclear Receptor Nomenclature Committee Cell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), indicating that these receptors are orthologous, i.e. they represent the same gene from different species. During our original characterization of BXR (5Blumberg B. Kang H. Bolado Jr., J. Chen H. Craig A.G. Moreno T.A. Umesono K. Perlmann T., De Robertis E.M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and SXR (8Blumberg B. Sabbagh W. Juguilon H. Bolado Jr., J. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), we noted that there was little overlap in the set of compounds that activated each receptor. This raised an important issue about the relationship between BXR and SXR/PXR because the latter are known to function as xenobiotic sensors. It is well known that human SXR and mouse PXR are pharmacologically distinct in that each has species-specific activators as well as compounds that activate across species (8, 9, 24; also reviewed in Refs. 1Blumberg B. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar and 25Xie W. Evans R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37739-37742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Therefore, one possibility is that BXRs are xenobiotic sensors but that the spectrum of compounds that activates them is species-specific. We conducted extensive ligand screening experiments and showed that neither BXR is activated by the broad spectrum of steroids and xenobiotic compounds that are known to activate SXR (Fig. 5). Moore andet al. (23Moore L.B. Maglich J.M. McKee D.D. Wisely B. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Lambert M.H. Moore J.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) have also tested a large number of steroids and xenobiotic compounds for BXR activation. In accord with our results, they show that BXRs are not activated by most steroids or xenobiotics (23Moore L.B. Maglich J.M. McKee D.D. Wisely B. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Lambert M.H. Moore J.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), which argues that BXRs do not function as broad specificity xenobiotic sensors. The only point of disagreement between our datasets is that they show 2.6-fold induction of BXRα by rifampicin, whereas it does not activate either BXR in our experiments. However, considering that activation of BXRα by bona fide ligands ranges from 180- to 1200-fold, it is difficult to ascertain whether the 2.6-fold induction by rifampicin represents ligand-dependent transactivation. We infer from our data and those of Moore et al. (23Moore L.B. Maglich J.M. McKee D.D. Wisely B. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Lambert M.H. Moore J.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) that BXRs are unlikely to function as xenobiotic sensors. SXR and PXR expression are enriched in the liver and intestine, where they activate the expression of cytochrome P450 genes and ABC family organic transporters to detoxify and eliminate xenobiotic compounds (25Xie W. Evans R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37739-37742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). On the other hand, BXRs are ubiquitously expressed with no particular enrichment in liver or intestine. No known bona fide BXR targets have been identified yet although it is believed that the Pit-1 gene contains a high affinity BXR target element (5Blumberg B. Kang H. Bolado Jr., J. Chen H. Craig A.G. Moreno T.A. Umesono K. Perlmann T., De Robertis E.M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Taken together with their lack of activation by the types of xenobiotic compounds that activate SXR/PXR, one is forced to conclude that these receptors are functionally distinct. It is highly unusual for orthologous nuclear receptors to exhibit such different expression patterns, hence one wonders whether the evolutionary pressure operating on members of this gene family is the same in different species. One possibility is that the BXRs are not really orthologous to SXR/PXR but rather represent a distinct family of receptors with an entirely different biology. For this model to be correct, one would expect to find BXR relatives in other vertebrates and SXR/PXR homologs inXenopus. We have not found sequences more closely related to BXR than SXR/PXR in the draft human and mouse genome sequences. Moreover, no sequences more closely related to SXR/PXR than BXR have appeared in the more than 200,000 Xenopus expressed sequence tags identified to date. We have not identified it in numerous screening experiments (data not shown). Thus, if BXR is not orthologous to SXR, it might be a receptor restricted to amphibians or lower vertebrates. This would make it the first such nuclear receptor identified. An alternative possibility is that BXR is orthologous to SXR in an evolutionary sense but has diverged functionally. This could be due to the different constraints on poikilothermic, aquatic animalsversus homoeothermic mammals. Xenopus is a carnivorous frog that likely has a very different diet from humans and rodents. Moore et al. (23Moore L.B. Maglich J.M. McKee D.D. Wisely B. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Lambert M.H. Moore J.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) recently identified SXR homologs from zebrafish, pig, dog, and monkey. They showed that the zebrafish gene was activated by several steroids and xenobiotic compounds (23Moore L.B. Maglich J.M. McKee D.D. Wisely B. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Lambert M.H. Moore J.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the BXRs are about equally similar to the zebrafish (46% identity) and the mammalian sequences (∼50% identity). Therefore, it appears that the functional divergence of BXRs from the SXR/PXR group of genes cannot be explained by the diet or aquatic nature of the organisms. Therefore, it will be very interesting to identify and characterize BXR and SXR homologs from other amphibians, reptiles, fishes, and lower chordates to determine at which point in evolution BXR localization and function diverged from SXR. Indeed, the question of whether BXR and SXR are true orthologs must await the identification of similar receptors from related species of fish and amphibians."

A picture of the ribosomal GTPase center has come from the facts that several ribosomal functions dependent on the GTP-binding factors are hampered by a single molecule of the antibiotic thiostrepton (reviewed in Ref. 1Cundliffe E.

Biol. 1990; 213: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that the function of L7/L12 is closely correlated with the 1070 RNA domain through L10. However, it is less easy to understand the molecular basis of functional correlation between L7/L12 and the 2660 RNA region. Hydroxyl radical probing has shown the close proximity of the sarcin/ricin loop to L11 bound to the 1070 region (20Holmberg L. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, current crystallographic and cryoelectron microscopic studies have clarified that the 1070 region and the sarcin/ricin loop are adjacent to each other in the ribosomal large subunit (21Ban N.

Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), there may be a dynamic network of RNA-protein, RNA-RNA, and protein-protein interactions involving L10·L7/L12, L11, and the 1070 and 2660 RNA regions in the GTPase center. Despite the highly conserved structures of the 1070 and 2660 RNA regions (26Gutell R.R. Gray M.W. Schnare M.N.

Wool I.G. Munishkin A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 275-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the GTPase center of eukaryotic ribosomes differs from the prokaryotic one in the following aspects. 1) The eukaryotic GTPase center functions only with eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF)-1α and eEF-2, not with the prokaryotic equivalents EF-Tu and EF-G (29Nathans D. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30Randi R. Ochoa S. J. Biol.

Hori K. Nomura T. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27578-27582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 3) Some ribotoxins, including ricin, which depurinates the A2660 base, are highly specific for eukaryotic ribosomes (33Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8735-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4) An anti-28 S human autoantibody strongly binds to the eukaryotic 1070 RNA domain, but not to the prokaryotic domain (34Uchiumi T. Traut R.R. Elkon K. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2054-2062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5) The antibiotic thiostrepton is specific only for the prokaryotic 1070 RNA region associated with the prokaryotic protein L11 (1Cundliffe E. Hardesty B. Kramer G. Structure, Function, and Genetics of Ribosomes. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., New York1986: 586-604Google Scholar). These characteristics of the eukaryotic GTPase center are apparently ascribed at least in part to eukaryotic ribosomal proteins and their interactions with the rRNA. The eukaryotic counterparts of prokaryotic L7/L12, L10, and L11 bound to the 1070 RNA region are believed to be P1/P2, P0, and eL12, respectively (35Wool I.G. Chan Y.-L. Glück A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 933-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Formation of a P0·P1/P2 complex has been demonstrated in various eukaryotic ribosomes: human (36Rich B.E. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4065-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), Artemia salina (37Uchiumi T. Wahba A.J. Traut R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We previously replacedE. coli L10·L7/L12 and L11 constituting the stalk of the 50 S subunits with rat P0·P1/P2 and eL12 and showed, by this replacement, the ribosome-acquired functional interactions with eEF-1α and eEF-2 instead of prokaryotic EF-Tu and EF-G (see Fig. 1) (31Uchiumi T. Honma S. Nomura T. Dabbs E.R. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3857-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This implies that the ribosomal proteins bound to the 1070 RNA domain are responsible for the kingdom-specific function of the GTPase center. This functional conversion is of interest in connection with the influence of the proteins on rRNA domains in the GTPase center. Here we show that the protein-dependent functional switch is accompanied by cooperative changes in some structural features of the 1070 and 2660 RNA regions of 23 S rRNA. From this study, we suggest an additional role of ribosomal proteins at the stalk region as modulators of the rRNA function in the GTPase center. The L11-deficient mutant strain AM68 of Escherichia coli (41Dabbs E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 734-737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. E. R. Dabbs (University of the Witwatersrand). The Q13 strain of E. coli was provided by Dr. A. Wada (Osaka Medical College). Ribosomes and the ribosomal subunits were prepared from both E. coli strains as described previously (31Uchiumi T. Honma S. Nomura T. Dabbs E.R. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3857-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The 50 S subunits deficient in L7/L12 protein (core I; see Fig. 1) were prepared from the Q13 50 S subunits according to Hamel et al. (12Hamel E. Koka M. Nakamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 805-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 50 S subunits deficient in L11 (core II) were from the AM68 strain. The 50 S particles deficient in both the L10·L7/L12 complex and L11 (core III) were prepared by extraction of core II in a solution containing 50% ethanol and 0.5 m NH4Cl at 0 °C as described previously (31Uchiumi T. Honma S. Nomura T. Dabbs E.R. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3857-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The 50 S core subunits and the released L7/L12 or L10·L7/L12 complex were recovered as described (12Hamel E. Koka M. Nakamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 805-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rat P0·P1/P2 protein complex and eL12 were prepared as described previously (38Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). E. coli L11 was purified as described previously (42Uchiumi T. Wada A. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29889-29893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment of rat protein binding to E. coli core samples, 20 pmol of 50 S core III subunits were incubated with 4 μg of P0·P1/P2 complex and 0.8 μg of eL12 in a solution (50 μl) containing 10 mmMgCl2, 75 mm NH4Cl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm potassium cacodylate, pH 7.2 (or 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), at 37 °C for 5 min. In some experiments, E. coli L10·L7/L12 and L11 were added instead of the rat proteins. Incorporation of rat proteins into the E. coli core particles was confirmed on native agarose/acrylamide composite gel (43Tokimatsu H. Strycharz W.A. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as described previously (31Uchiumi T. Honma S. Nomura T. Dabbs E.R. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3857-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Ribosome samples (20 pmol) in 50 μl of 10 mm MgCl2, 75 mm NH4Cl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm potassium cacodylate, pH 7.2, were mixed with 1 μl of dimethyl sulfate (DMS; 1:4 dilution in ethanol) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. A portion of rRNA extracted from each sample with phenol was analyzed by primer extraction and gel electrophoresis as described by Moazed and Noller (44Moazed D. Noller H.F. Cell. 1986; 47: 985-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The primers used were 5′-GCTTCGGTGCATGGTTTAGC-3′ for the 1070 domain and 5′-CTCGGGGCAAGTTTCGTGCT-3′ for the 2060 domain, complementary to residues 1139–1158 and 2758–2777 of 23 S rRNA, respectively. Lupus serum containing a high titer of anti-28 S antibody (34Uchiumi T. Traut R.R. Elkon K. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2054-2062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), specific for the GTPase-associated RNA domain, was provided by Dr. Keith Elkon (Cornell University Medical College). The IgG was purified with a protein A-agarose column (Bio-Rad). To remove the low titer of antibodies to ribosomal proteins present in the serum, the isolated IgG was applied to a column of Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) coupled with rat total ribosomal proteins (38Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The Fab fragments were prepared by papain digestion of the IgG (38Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The undigested IgG and the Fc fragment were removed with protein A-agarose. The DNA fragments containing residues 1030–1124 of E. coli 23 S rRNA and the corresponding region of rat 28 S rRNA were amplified by PCR (45Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Sharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13517) Google Scholar) and inserted into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pSPT18 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The RNA fragments were synthesized using the plasmid DNAs and SP6 RNA polymerase as described previously (46Uchiumi T. Sato N. Wada A. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 681-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The [32P]RNA fragments (10 pmol) in 10 μl of solution containing 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, and 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, were mixed with 1.0 μg of E. coli L10·L7/L12 complex or rat P0·P1/P2 and 0.3 μg of E. coli L11 or rat eL12 and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The samples were then mixed with 12 μg of anti-28 S Fab fragments and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The RNA·protein complexes were separated on native 6% polyacrylamide gel as described previously (38Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The type 1 ribotoxin pepocin, which is highly specific to eukaryotic ribosomes, was purified from pumpkin, Cucurbita pepo (47Yoshinari S. Yokota S. Sawamoto H. Koresawa S. Tamura M. Endo Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Another type 1 toxin, gypsophilin, which acts on prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic ribosomes, was purified from Gypsophila elegans (48Yoshinari S. Koresawa S. Yokota S. Sawamoto H. Tamura M. Endo Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Ribosome samples (10 pmol) were incubated with pepocin or gypsophilin in 50 μl of 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, at 37 °C for 20 min. Ribosomal RNA was extracted with phenol, and a portion of each sample was used as the template for primer extension as described above. Depurination at position 2660 by toxins was detected as a stop signal of primer extension by gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. Levels of sensitivity for toxins were estimated by the intensity of radioactivity of the stop signals. eEF-1α and eEF-2 were isolated from pig liver as described by Iwasaki and Kaziro (49Iwasaki K. Kaziro Y. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 657-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). E. coliEF-Tu (50Arai K. Kawakita M. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1974; 76: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and EF-G (51Kaziro Y. Inoue-Yokosawa N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1972; 72: 853-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) were prepared as described. The eEF-2-dependent GTPase activity of the hybrid ribosomes was assayed in 20 μl of solution containing 2.5 pmol of hybrid 50 S subunits, 7.5 pmol of 30 S subunits (optimum for the activity), 3 nmol of [γ-32P]GTP (40–50 cpm/pmol), 0.5 μg of eEF-2, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NH4Cl, 12.5 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, which was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The inorganic phosphate liberated was counted as described previously (32Uchiumi T. Hori K. Nomura T. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27578-27582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The eEF-1α/eEF-2-dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis was performed in 100 μl of solution containing 5 pmol of hybrid 50 S submits, 25 pmol of 30 S subunits (optimum for the activity), 10 μg of poly(U), 80 μg of E. coli tRNA pre-charged with 40 pmol of [14C]phenylalanine (400 cpm/pmol), 9 mmMgCl2, 80 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of eEF-2, and 4 μg of eEF-1α, which was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The prokaryotic EF-Tu/EF-G-dependent reaction was carried out under the same conditions, except that the reaction mixture contained 1 μg of EF-G and 4 μg of EF-Tu instead of eEF-1α and eEF-2. The polymerized radioactivity was counted as described by Möller et al. (13Möller W. Schrier P.I. Maassen J.A. Zantema A. Schop E. Reinalda H. Cremers A.F. Mellema J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 63: 553-573Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The L10·L7/L12 complex is selectively removed from the L11-deficient 50 S subunit (core II) (Fig.1), and then the rat protein counterparts P0·P1/P2 and eL12 are bound to the 50 S core particle (core III). This protein replacement causes conversion of ribosomal specificity for elongation factors from prokaryotic EF-Tu and EF-G to eEF-1α and eEF-2, and the hybrid ribosomes show poly(U)-dependent polyphenylalanine synthetic activity with the eukaryotic factors (31Uchiumi T. Honma S. Nomura T. Dabbs E.R. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3857-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To clarify whether rat P0·P1/P2 and eL12 are substituted for E. coli L10·L7/L12 and L11 at their binding sites on the domain around position 1070 of 23 S rRNA, we analyzed the RNA region by footprinting using DMS as a chemical probe (Fig.2). Upon removing L11 and more notably upon removing both L11 and L10·L7/L12, the reactivity of bases C1072, A1084, A1085, A1086, A1089, C1102, and A1103 with DMS was enhanced (Fig. 2 A,lanes 3 and 4). The reactivity of A1088 was markedly enhanced by deletion of only L11, whereas A1046 was reactive in the absence of both L10·L7/L12 and L11. Addition of either rat P0·P1/P2 (lane 5) or eL12 (lane 7) to the 50 S core III subunit protected the chemical modifications of all these bases, except A1046, A1088, and A1089. The modification of A1088 was protected only by eL12, whereas that of A1089 was protected by P0·P1/P2 and enhanced by eL12. A1070 was also enhanced by eL12. The rat proteins had no effect on modification of A1046. We also tested the effect of the protein replacement at the 1070 RNA region on chemical modifications around position 2660 of 23 S rRNA. No effect was detected by chemical probing in the region including residues 2640–2770 (data not shown). To examine the effect of the rat proteins on the 1070 domain of E. coli 23 S rRNA, we used an RNA probe, anti-28 S antibody from human autoimmune serum (34Uchiumi T. Traut R.R. Elkon K. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2054-2062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Chu J.L. Brot N. Weissbach H. Elkon K. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which recognizes a conformational epitope of the eukaryotic 1070 RNA domain (38Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has been also shown that the reactivity of anti-28 S antibody with E. coli 50 S subunits is very low compared with that with HeLa and rat 60 S subunits (34Uchiumi T. Traut R.R. Elkon K. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2054-2062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, the anti-28 S Fab fragment did not bind to an RNA fragment covering the 1070 region of E. coli 23 S rRNA upon gel retardation (Fig. 3 A,lane 2), although it bound strongly to the equivalent fragment of rat 28 S rRNA (38Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). By contrast, E. coliribosomal proteins L10·L7/L12 (lanes 3 and 4) and L11 (lanes 5 and 6) bound to the E. coli RNA fragment. This binding of E. coli proteins had no effect on anti-28 S antibody binding (lanes 4 and6). However, cross-binding of the rat P0·P1/P2 complex to the E. coli RNA (lane 7) resulted in accessibility of the RNA to the anti-28 S Fab fragment, as shown in a supershift (lane 8). Binding of rat eL12 (lane 9) also allowed the RNA weak access to the anti-28 S Fab fragment (lane 10). Anti-28 S antibody bound to the hybrid ribosomes containing rat P0·P1/P2 and eL12 and inhibited the GTPase activity dependent on eEF-2 (Fig. 3 B). Because anti-28 S antibody was prepared from polyclonal human IgG (see “Materials and Methods”), we performed an antibody absorption test to confirm that this inhibition was due to anti-28 S antibody, and not to some other antibody. The anti-28 S antibody sample was preincubated with the rat RNA fragment covering the 1070 region of 28 S rRNA to which anti-28 S antibody strongly bound (38Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3302-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). During this preincubation, the ribosomal GTPase activity was rescued from inhibition by the antibody (Fig.3 B). The results indicate that the inhibition of the activity results from binding of anti-28 S antibody to the 1070 RNA domain in the hybrid ribosome. We also examined whether the protein replacement at the 1070 RNA domain affects the 2660 region, the sarcin/ricin loop, of 23 S rRNA. As a probe of the structure and function of the 2660 region, we used the type 1 ribotoxin pepocin, which efficiently depurinates the A2660 base of mammalian ribosomes and is 0.0001-fold less effective inE. coli ribosomes (47Yoshinari S. Yokota S. Sawamoto H. Koresawa S. Tamura M. Endo Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We assayed the pepocin-dependent depurination of A2660 by primer extension (Fig. 4 A). Depurination was detected neither in the E. coli 50 S subunit (lane 2) nor in the naked 23 S rRNA (lane 7) under conditions including 0.3 μm pepocin, an amount more than adequate to depurinate base 2660 of rat 60 S subunits (data not shown). Pepocin had no effect on 50 S core III subunits deficient in L10·L7/L12 and L11 (lane 3). Addition of rat P0·P1/P2 alone (lane 4) and eL12 alone (lane 5) to core III had no effect on pepocin accessibility. However, addition of these rat proteins together to core III caused sensitivity to pepocin (lane 6), indicating that binding of both the rat proteins to the 1070 RNA domain makes the E. coli 2660 RNA domain accessible to pepocin. To demonstrate a contribution of the 2660 RNA domain to the function of the hybrid ribosomes, we tested the effects of pepocin treatment on the induced functions of the hybrid ribosomes. The activities of eEF-2-dependent GTPase (Fig. 4 B) and eEF-1α/eEF-2-dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis (Fig.4 C) of the hybrid ribosomes were inhibited by the toxin treatment (0.3–1.2 μm). The same pepocin treatment had no effect on the activities of E. coli ribosomes dependent on prokaryotic EF-Tu and EF-G. Therefore, the 2660 RNA region affected by the rat proteins is apparently functional with eukaryotic elongation factors in the hybrid ribosome. To examine the interaction of eEF-2 with the 1070 and 2660 RNA regions in the hybrid ribosomes, DMS footprinting analysis was performed (Fig. 5). Chemical modifications of bases around the 2660 (Fig. 5 A) and 1070 (Fig. 5 B) regions were analyzed by primer extension and gel analysis. Addition of eEF-2 and the non-cleavable GTP analog GMP-PNP to the hybrid ribosomes in which L10·L7/L12 and L11 were replaced with rat P0·P1/P2 and eL12 resulted in protection of bases G2659, A2660, and A2665 against the modification (Fig. 5 A,lane 3). No protection was detected when GTP was substituted for GMP-PNP (lane 2) and when the intact E. coliribosomes were used instead of the hybrid ribosomes (lanes 4–6). eEF-2/GMP-PNP protection was also observed at A1067 in the domain to which the rat proteins bound (Fig.5 B, lane 3), but not at the same base in the intact E. coli ribosomes (lane 5). The results are summarized in Fig. 5 C. Our results described above indicate a strong correlation between rat ribosomal proteins at the 1070 RNA domain and the functional state of the 2660 RNA region. These results pose the question of whether or not the E. coli counterparts L10·L7/L12 and L11 also influence the state of the 2660 RNA region in the 50 S subunit. To examine this point, we used another type 1 ribotoxin, gypsophilin, as a probe for the structure of the 2660 region in E. coli ribosomes. Unlike pepocin, gypsophilin is reactive with E. coli ribosomes at low concentrations; depurination of the A2660 base in 50 S subunits was detected at >1 nm toxin concentratio"
