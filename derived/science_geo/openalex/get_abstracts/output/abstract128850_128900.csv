https://openalex.org/W2105109101,"We investigated brain circuitry mediating cocaine- induced euphoria and craving using functional MRI (fMRI). During double-blind cocaine (0.6 mg/kg) and saline infusions in cocaine-dependent subjects, the entire brain was imaged for 5 min before and 13 min after infusion while subjects rated scales for rush, high, low, and craving. Cocaine induced focal signal increases in nucleus accumbens/subcallosal cortex (NAc/SCC), caudate, putamen, basal forebrain, thalamus, insula, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, cingulate, lateral prefrontal and temporal cortices, parietal cortex, striate/extrastriate cortices, ventral tegmentum, and pons and produced signal decreases in amygdala, temporal pole, and medial frontal cortex. Saline produced few positive or negative activations, which were localized to lateral prefrontal cortex and temporo-occipital cortex. Subjects who underwent repeat studies showed good replication of the regional fMRI activation pattern following cocaine and saline infusions, with activations on saline retest that might reflect expectancy. Brain regions that exhibited early and short duration signal maxima showed a higher correlation with rush ratings. These included the ventral tegmentum, pons, basal forebrain, caudate, cingulate, and most regions of lateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, regions that demonstrated early but sustained signal maxima were more correlated with craving than with rush ratings; such regions included the NAc/SCC, right parahippocampal gyrus, and some regions of lateral prefrontal cortex. Sustained negative signal change was noted in the amygdala, which correlated with craving ratings. Our data demonstrate the ability of fMRI to map dynamic patterns of brain activation following cocaine infusion in cocaine-dependent subjects and provide evidence of dynamically changing brain networks associated with cocaine-induced euphoria and cocaine-induced craving."

https://openalex.org/W2066015662,"To study the role of G protein-coupled, inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels in mediating neurotransmitter actions in hippocampal neurons, we have examined slices from transgenic mice lacking the GIRK2 gene. The outward currents evoked by agonists for GABAB receptors, 5HT1A receptors, and adenosine A1 receptors were essentially absent in mutant mice, while the inward current evoked by muscarinic receptor activation was unaltered. In contrast, the presynaptic inhibitory action of a number of presynaptic receptors on excitatory and inhibitory terminals was unaltered in mutant mice. These included GABAB, adenosine, muscarinic, metabotropic glutamate, and NPY receptors on excitatory synapses and GABAB and opioid receptors on inhibitory synapses. These findings suggest that a number of G protein-coupled receptors activate the same class of postsynaptic K+ channel, which contains GIRK2. In addition, the GIRK2 channels play no role in the inhibition mediated by presynaptic G protein-coupled receptors, suggesting that the same receptor can couple to different effector systems according to its subcellular location in the neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2021087194,"Semaphorins are a large family of secreted and transmembrane proteins, several of which are implicated in repulsive axon guidance. Neuropilin (neuropilin-1) was recently identified as a receptor for Collapsin-1/Semaphorin III/D (Sema III). We report the identification of a related protein, neuropilin-2, whose mRNA is expressed by developing neurons in a pattern largely, though not completely, nonoverlapping with that of neuropilin-1. Unlike neuropilin-1, which binds with high affinity to the three structurally related semaphorins Sema III, Sema E, and Sema IV, neuropilin-2 shows high affinity binding only to Sema E and Sema IV, not Sema III. These results identify neuropilins as a family of receptors (or components of receptors) for at least one semaphorin subfamily. They also suggest that the specificity of action of different members of this subfamily may be determined by the complement of neuropilins expressed by responsive cells."
https://openalex.org/W2021789384,"Irregular firing patterns are observed in most central neurons in vivo, but their origin is controversial. Here, we show that two types of inhibitory neurons in the cerebellar cortex fire spontaneously and regularly in the absence of synaptic input but generate an irregular firing pattern in the presence of tonic synaptic inhibition. Paired recordings between synaptically connected neurons revealed that single action potentials in inhibitory interneurons cause highly variable delays in action potential firing in their postsynaptic cells. Activity in single and multiple inhibitory interneurons also significantly reduces postsynaptic membrane time constant and input resistance. These findings suggest that the time window for synaptic integration is a dynamic variable modulated by the level of tonic inhibition, and that rate coding and temporal coding strategies may be used in parallel in the same cell type."

https://openalex.org/W2092109656,"Xestospongins (Xe's) A, C, D, araguspongine B, and demethylxestospongin B, a group of macrocyclic bis-1-oxaquinolizidines isolated from the Australian sponge, Xestospongia species, are shown to be potent blockers of IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum vesicles of rabbit cerebellum. XeC blocks IP3-induced Ca2+ release (IC50 = 358 nM) without interacting with the IP3-binding site, suggesting a mechanism that is independent of the IP3 effector site. Analysis of Pheochromocytoma cells and primary astrocytes loaded with Ca2+-sensitive dye reveals that XeC selectively blocks bradykinin- and carbamylcholine-induced Ca2+ efflux from endoplasmic reticulum stores. Xe's represent a new class of potent, membrane permeable IP3 receptor blockers exhibiting a high selectivity over ryanodine receptors. Xe's are a valuable tool for investigating the structure and function of IP3 receptors and Ca2+ signaling in neuronal and nonneuronal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2110258654,"Synapses are continually regulated by chemical modulators and by their own activity. We tested the specificity of regulation in two excitatory pathways of the neocortex: thalamocortical (TC) synapses, which mediate specific inputs, and intracortical (IC) synapses, which mediate the recombination of cortical information. Frequency-sensitive depression was much stronger in TC synapses than in IC synapses. The two synapse types were differentially sensitive to presynaptic neuromodulators: only IC synapses were suppressed by activation of GABAB receptors, only TC synapses were enhanced by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors suppressed both synapse types. Modulators also differentially altered the frequency sensitivity of the synapses. Our results suggest a mechanism by which the relative strength and dynamics of input and associational pathways of neocortex are regulated during changes in behavioral state."
https://openalex.org/W2000795527,"Single neurons were recorded in freely behaving rats during fear conditioning from areas of auditory cortex that project to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA). The latency and rate of conditioning and extinction were analyzed, and the results were compared to previous recordings from LA itself. Auditory cortex neurons took more trials to learn, and they responded more slowly than LA neurons within trials. Short-latency plasticity in LA, therefore, reflects inputs from the auditory thalamus rather than the auditory cortex. Unlike LA cells, some auditory cortex cells showed late conditioned responses that seemed to anticipate the unconditioned stimulus, while others showed extinction-resistant memory storage. Thus, rapid conditioning of fear responses to potentially dangerous stimuli depends on plasticity in the amygdala, while cortical areas may be particularly involved in higher cognitive (mnemonic and attentional) processing of fear experiences."
https://openalex.org/W2068599628,"The molecules of the collapsin/semaphorin gene family have been thought to play an essential role in axon guidance during development. Semaphorin III/D is a member of this family, has been shown to repel dorsal root ganglion (DRG) axons in vitro, and has been implicated in the patterning of sensory afferents in the spinal cord. Although semaphorin III/D mRNA is expressed in a wide variety of neural and nonneural tissues in vivo, the role played by semaphorin III/D in regions other than the spinal cord is not known. Here, we show that mice homozygous for a targeted mutation in semaphorin III/D show severe abnormality in peripheral nerve projection. This abnormality is seen in the trigeminal, facial, vagus, accessory, and glossopharyngeal nerves but not in the oculomotor nerve. These results suggest that semaphorin III/D functions as a selective repellent in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2130196728,"The acquisition of cell type-specific morphologies is a central feature of neuronal differentiation and has important consequences for nervous system function. To begin to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms, we have explored the role of Rho-related GTPases in the dendritic development of cortical neurons. Expression of dominant negative mutants of Rac or Cdc42, the Rho-inhibitory molecule C3 transferase, or the GTPase-activating protein RhoGAP p190 causes a marked reduction in the number of primary dendrites in nonpyramidal (multipolar) neurons and in the number of basal dendrites in neurons with pyramidal morphologies. Conversely, the expression of constitutively active mutants of Rho, Rac, or Cdc42 leads to an increase in the number of primary and basal dendrites. In cortical cultures, as in vivo, dendritic remodeling leads to an apparent transformation from pyramidal to nonpyramidal morphologies over time. Strikingly, this shift in favor of nonpyramidal morphologies is also inhibited by the expression of dominant negative mutants of Cdc42 and Rac and by RhoGAP p190. These observations indicate that Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 play a central role in dendritic development and suggest that differential activation of Rho-related GTPases may contribute to the generation of morphological diversity in the developing cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2023390598,"We examined the role of TrkB ligands in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) using function-blocking TrkB antiserum (Ab) and Trk-IgG fusion proteins. Incubation of hippocampal slices with TrkB Ab had no effect on basal synaptic transmission, short-term plasticity, or LTP induced by several trains of tetanic stimulation. The TrkB Ab-treated slices, however, showed significant deficits in LTP induced by either theta-burst stimulation (TBS) or ""pairing."" Slices exposed to the same number of inducing stimuli, delivered either as TBS or as a single 100 Hz epoch, only exhibited TrkB-sensitive LTP when TBS was used, indicating that the temporal pattern of stimulation determines the neurotrophin dependence. The late phase of LTP (2-3 hr) was also significantly impaired in slices pretreated with TrkB Ab or a TrkB-IgG. The application of a TrkB-IgG 30 min after LTP induction caused previously potentiated synaptic transmission to return to baseline levels, indicating that TrkB ligands are required to maintain LTP for up to 1 hr after induction. Taken together, these results indicate that both the temporal patterns of synaptic activity and the different temporal phases of synaptic enhancement are important in determining the neurotrophin dependence of plasticity in the hippocampus."

https://openalex.org/W2136115516,"In many neurons, responses to individual quanta of transmitter exhibit large variations in amplitude. The origin of this variability, although central to our understanding of synaptic transmission and plasticity, remains controversial. To examine the relationship between quantal amplitude and postsynaptic receptor number, we adopted a novel approach, combining patch-clamp recording of synaptic currents with quantitative immunogold localization of synaptic receptors. Here, we report that in cerebellar stellate cells, where variability in GABA miniature synaptic currents is particularly marked, the distribution of quantal amplitudes parallels that of synaptic GABA(A) receptor number. We also show that postsynaptic GABA(A) receptor density is uniform, allowing synaptic area to be used as a measure of relative receptor content. Flurazepam, which increases GABA(A) receptor affinity, prolongs the decay of all miniature currents but selectively increases the amplitude of large events. From this differential effect, we show that a quantum of GABA saturates postsynaptic receptors when <80 receptors are present but results in incomplete occupancy at larger synapses."

https://openalex.org/W2069873661,"Embryonic retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons must extend toward and grow through the optic disc to exit the eye into the optic nerve. In the embryonic mouse eye, we found that immunoreactivity for the axon guidance molecule netrin-1 was specifically on neuroepithelial cells at the disk surrounding exiting RGC axons, and RGC axons express the netrin receptor, DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer). In vitro, anti-DCC antibodies reduced RGC neurite outgrowth responses to netrin-1. In netrin-1- and DCC-deficient embryos, RGC axon pathfinding to the disc was unaffected; however, axons failed to exit into the optic nerve, resulting in optic nerve hypoplasia. Thus, netrin-1 through DCC appears to guide RGC axons locally at the optic disc rather than at long range, apparently reflecting the localization of netrin-1 protein to the vicinity of netrin-1-producing cells at the optic disc."

https://openalex.org/W2033212544,"The pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM), an incurable tumour causing the deregulated proliferation of terminally differentiated B cells, is unknown. Chromosomal translocations (14q1) affecting band 14q32 and unidentified partner chromosomes are common in this tumour, suggesting that they may cause the activation of novel oncogenes. By cloning the chromosomal breakpoints in an MM cell line, we show that the 14q+ translocation represents a t(6;14)x(p25;q32) and that this aberration is recurrent in MM, as it was found in two of eleven MM cell lines. The translocation juxtaposes the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) locus to MUM1 (multiple myeloma oncogene 1)/IRF4 gene, a member of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family known to be active in the control of B-cell proliferation and differentiation. As a result, the MUM1/IRF4 gene is overexpressed--an event that may contribute to tumorigenesis, a MUM1/IRF4 has oncogenic activity in vitro. These findings identify a novel genetic alteration associated with MM, with implications for the pathogenesis and diagnostics of this tumour."

https://openalex.org/W2063423731,"Long-term potentiation at CA3–CA1 hippocampal synapses exhibits an early phase and a late phase, which can be distinguished by their underlying molecular mechanisms. Unlike the early phase, the late phase is dependent on both cAMP and protein synthesis. Quantal analysis of unitary synaptic transmission between a single presynaptic CA3 neuron and a single postsynaptic CA1 neuron suggests that, under certain conditions, the early phase of LTP involves an increase in the probability of release of a single quantum of transmitter from a single presynaptic release site, with no change in the number of quanta that are released or in postsynaptic sensitivity to transmitter. Here, we show that the cAMP-induced late phase of LTP involves an increase in the number of quanta released in response to a single presynaptic action potential, possibly due to an increase in the number of sites of synaptic transmission between a single CA3 and a single CA1 neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2328215872,"The mechanism by which Bcl-2 oncogene expression inhibits radiation-induced apoptosis has been investigated in two mouse lymphoma cell lines: line LY-as is radiation sensitive, displays substantial radiaton-induced apoptosis, and expresses low levels of Bcl-2; line LY-ar is radiation-resistant, displays a low apoptosis propensity, and expresses 30-fold higher amount of Bcl-2 protein than does the sensitive line. We observed that upon incubation in cystine/methionine-free (C/M-) medium, radiation-induced apoptosis in the LY-ar cells was restored to levels comparable to that seen in the LY-as cells. lntracellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations in LY-ar cells incubated in C/M- medium plummeted to 50% of control values within 2 h. LY-ar cells treated with diethyl maleate (DEM) or diamide, agents that deplete cellular thiols, had increased susceptibility to radiation-induced apoptosis in a manner similar to C/M- medium. These results are consistent with the general idea that Bcl-2 expression blocks apoptosis through an antioxidant pathway that involves cellular thiols. That Bcl-2-expressing tumor cells can be sensitized by exogeneous agents that modify cellular thiols offers strategies for overcoming such resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2081913959,"Collapsin-1, a member of the semaphorin family, activates receptors on specific growth cones, thereby inhibiting their motility. Neuropilin, a previously cloned transmembrane protein, has recently been identified as a candidate receptor for collapsin-1. We have completed the cloning of chick collapsin-3 and -5 and show that collapsin-1, -2, -3, and -5 bind to overlapping but distinct axon tracts. We infer that in situ, there are distinct receptors with different affinities for collapsin-1, -2, -3, and -5. In contrast, these four collapsins all bind recombinant neuropilin with similar affinities. Strong binding to neuropilin is mediated by the carboxy third of the collapsins, while the semaphorin domain confers their unique binding patterns in situ. We propose that neuropilin is a common component of a semaphorin receptor complex, and that additional differentially expressed receptor components interact with the semaphorin domains to confer binding specificity."

https://openalex.org/W2052646014,"Functional mapping of neurotransmitter receptors requires rapid and localized application of transmitter. The usefulness of caged glutamate for this purpose has been limited, because photolysis by unfocused light above and below the target cell limits depth resolution. This problem is eliminated by using a double-caged glutamate that requires absorption of two photons for conversion to active glutamate, resulting in a substantial improvement in spatial resolution over conventional caged glutamate. This method was used to map the distribution of glutamate receptors on hippocampal pyramidal neurons. A higher density of AMPA receptors was found on distal apical dendrites than on basal or primary apical dendrites, suggesting that synaptic efficacy is locally heterogeneous. Such ""chemical two-photon uncaging"" offers a simple, general, and economical strategy for spatially localized photolysis of caged compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2037082175,"In Drosophila, motoneuron growth cones initially probe many potential muscle targets but later withdraw most of these contacts to form stereotypic synapses with only one or a few muscles. Prior to synapse formation, Fasciclin II (Fas II) is expressed at low levels on muscle. During synapse formation, Fas II concentrates at the synapse and disappears from the rest of the muscle. We previously showed that Fas II is required both pre- and postsynaptically for synaptic stabilization. Here, we show that the differential expression of target-derived Fas II has a profound influence on the patterning of synapse formation. A transient increase in muscle Fas II stabilizes growth cone contacts and leads to novel synapses that are functional and stable; targets that normally receive two inputs can now receive up to six inputs. Changing the relative levels of Fas II on neighboring muscles leads to dramatic shifts in target selection."
https://openalex.org/W2077515896,"The semaphorin family contains secreted and transmembrane signaling proteins that function in the nervous, immune, and cardiovascular systems. Chick collapsin-1 is a repellent for specific growth cones. Two other secreted members of the semaphorin family, collapsin-2 and -3, are structurally similar to collapsin-1 but have different biological activities. Semaphorins contain a 500 amino acid family signature semaphorin domain. We show in this study that (1) the semaphorin domain of collapsin-1 is both necessary and sufficient for biological activity, (2) the semaphorin domain contains a 70 amino acid region that specifies the biological activity of the three family members, and (3) the positively charged carboxy terminus potentiates activity without affecting specificity. We propose that semaphorins interact with their receptors through two independent binding sites: one that mediates the biological response and one that potentiates it."

https://openalex.org/W2074933917,"We have cloned a Kv2 potassium channel from squid optic lobe termed sqKv2. Multiple overlapping sqKv2 cDNA clones differed from one another at specific positions by purine transitions. To test whether the purine transitions were generated by RNA editing, we compared a 360 nucleotide genomic sequence with corresponding cDNA sequences (encoding S4–S6) isolated from individual animals and lying on a single gene and exon. cDNA sequences differed from genomic sequence at 17 positions, resulting in 28 unique sequences. There was invariantly an adenosine in the genomic sequence and a guanosine in the edited cDNA sequences. Two of the edits altered the rates of channel closure and slow inactivation. These results extend selective RNA editing to invertebrate taxa and represents a novel mechanism for the posttranscriptional modulation of voltage-gated ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W2076482220,"To clarify the role of muscle-derived neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) in the development of sensory neurons, we generated transgenic mice selectively overexpressing NT-3 in skeletal muscles under the control of a myogenin promoter (myo-NT-3 mice). The myo-NT-3 transgene was then bred into an NT-3 null mutant (-/-) line to generate myo-NT-3, NT-3(-/-) mice in which NT-3 was expressed in muscles, but not elsewhere. Transient overexpression of NT-3 in developing muscles increased the number of proprioceptive neurons as well as the density of both their central and peripheral projections, resulting in more Ia afferents in spinal cord and more spindles (end organs of Ia afferents) in muscles. NT-3 expression restricted to muscles was sufficient to secure the development of proprioceptive neurons and their central and peripheral projections in myo-NT-3, NT-3(-/-) mice. The loss of nonproprioceptive neurons observed in NT-3(-/-) mice was not reversed by the transgene, suggesting that these neurons are regulated by NT-3 from sources other than muscle. We conclude that target-derived rather than intraganglionic NT-3 is preeminent in supporting the development of proprioceptive neurons. The level of NT-3 in developing muscles may be the principal factor determining the number of proprioceptive neurons in dorsal root ganglions and spindles in skeletal muscles of adults."

https://openalex.org/W2053620695,"The early patterning of the vertebrate central nervous system involves the generation of progenitor cells with distinct fates at rostral and caudal levels of the neuraxis. We provide evidence that the assignment of early rostrocaudal differences in progenitor cell properties is established by spatial restrictions in the signaling properties of the paraxial mesoderm and epidermal ectoderm. Caudal level paraxial mesoderm secretes a factor, distinct from retinoic acid or fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), that can impose caudal fates on prospective anterior proencephalic progenitors. The caudalizing activity of the paraxial mesoderm can, however, be induced by FGF signaling. The distinct properties of cells at rostral and caudal levels of the neural plate appear to depend, in addition, on the early exclusion of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) from rostral level epidermal ectoderm. Thus, differences in the signaling properties of cell groups that flank the neural plate appear to contribute to the early rostrocaudal identity of neural cells, distinguishing progenitor cells at prospective anterior proencephalic regions from those at more caudal levels of the neuraxis."
https://openalex.org/W2332613132,"In this report we demonstrate that cells expressing the human papillomavirus type 16 E5 open reading frame (HPV16-E5) show a greatly enhanced transcription of the immediate early genes after EGF or PMA treatment compared to control cells. This enhancement is due to amplification of the signal transduction pathways in response to growth factors or phorbol esters. Upon short-time EGF treatment of the E5-expressing cells we observed an increase in the activation of EGF receptors, resulting in a stronger activation of MAP kinases ERK1/2 compared to control-transfected cells. We also observed that in E5-expressing cells, treatment with PMA results in an increase in membrane-associated PKC activity, and a superactivation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinases. This superactivation is PKC-dependent, since pretreatment of the cells with the PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220 inhibits MAP kinase activation and early gene transcription almost completely. Furthermore, treatment with genistein strongly reduces the PMA-mediated superactivation of ERK1/2 kinases, demonstrating a PKC-mediated, tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway in the superinduction of MAP kinase activation. Thus, HPV16-E5 effects superactivation of MAP kinases over at least two different pathways, a PKC-mediated, and another, receptor tyrosine-kinase mediated, PKC-independent one."

https://openalex.org/W2319769206,"A novel neuregulin isoform, termed γ-HRG, was cloned and characterized from the human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-175. As observed with other neuregulins, γ-HRG, is a product of alternative mRNA splicing of the neuregulin gene. γ-HRG contains the EGF-like and immunoglobulin-like domains that are commonly found in other family members, but lacks a transmembrane and cytoplasmic region. The new isoform possesses a unique N-terminal region that includes a hydrophobic domain that may function as a secretion signal. A purified recombinant version of γ-HRG competes for binding to soluble ErbB3- and ErbB4-IgG fusion proteins with affinities similar to those observed for rHRGβ1177 – 244. γ-HRG has a wide distribution in mesenchymal or neuronal tissues but in contrast to other neuregulins, it is not present in breast, lung, liver and small intestine. Expression of γ-HRG with its cognate receptors, ErbB3 and ErbB2 suggested that the growth of the MDA-MB-175 cell line might be a result of the autocrine stimulation of a growth factor signaling pathway. Treatment of MDA-MB-175 cells with an anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody that interferes with the ligand-dependent formation of ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimer complexes shows a strong growth inhibitory effect on this cell line. Moreover, incubation with a receptor-IgG fusion protein that neutralizes secreted γ-HRG, also inhibits cell growth. These data suggest that the secretion of γ-HRG by MDA-MB-175 cells leads to the formation of a constitutively active receptor complex and stimulates the growth of these cells in an autocrine manner."

https://openalex.org/W2329953535,"Mutations in the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Btk result in the B cell immunodeficiencies X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) in humans and X-linked immunodeficiency (xid) in mice. Genetic and biochemical evidence implicates Btk as a key component of several B cell signaling pathways. Activation of Btk by a point mutation (E41K) within the PH domain (Btk*) results in fibroblast transformation and is correlated with increased membrane localization of Btk. When wild type Btk is activated by coexpression with Lyn, the tyrosine phosphorylated pool of Btk is highly enriched in the membrane fraction. To determine whether membrane association is sufficient to activate Btk, we targeted Btk to the plasma membrane using a series of fusion proteins including GagBtk, CD16Btk and CD4Btk. Constitutive membrane association greatly enhanced the ability of Btk to transform Rat2 fibroblasts in the presence of high levels of Src activity. All membrane targeted forms of Btk were highly tyrosine phosphorylated. Transformation required membrane localization, Btk kinase activity, transphosphorylation by Src family kinases, and an intact SH2 domain but not the PH or SH3 domains. These data suggest that membrane localization is a critical early step in Btk activation."

https://openalex.org/W2333639788,"Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF)-1 has been characterized as an important growth regulatory and immunomodulatory transcription factor. To further characterize the potential targets of IRF-1 antiproliferative activity, IRF-1 was expressed under the control of the tetracycline-inducible system in murine NIH3T3 cells. Due to their ability to mimic IRF-1 transactivator function, the regulatory potential of IRF-1/RelA and IRF-2/RelA fusion proteins consisting of the DNA binding domains of IRF-1 or IRF-2 fused to the transactivation domain of NF-κB RelA(p65) was also examined. Cells inducibly expressing IRF-1 or IRF/RelA in response to doxycycline treatment displayed significantly reduced growth rates compared to control cells, and inhibition of cell growth correlated directly with the level of transgene expression. Interestingly, IRF-1 and IRF/RelA expression also induced a low level of apoptosis, as detected by microscopic analyses. Furthermore, expression of the interferon inducible, double stranded RNA dependent kinase PKR was increased following IRF-1 or IRF/RelA induction. Most strikingly, induction of IRF-1 and IRF/RelA expression resulted in a significant increase in STAT1 (p91) protein and increased ISGF3 DNA binding activity, suggesting that IRF-1 tumor suppressor activity may involve a novel mechanism which activates the JAK-STAT pathway through STAT1. WAF1 levels were also constitutively elevated in IRF-1 and IRF-1/RelA cells. These studies demonstrate that inducible expression of the transactivation function of IRF-1 or IRF/RelA mediates tumor suppressor activity by inducing cell growth arrest, apoptosis and the differential activation of growth regulatory genes such as PKR, STAT1 and WAF1."
https://openalex.org/W2321015982,"Butyrate, a physiologically occurring agent, has been reported to decrease constitutively high expressed p53 levels in transformed cells. To elucidate whether butyrate also inhibits DNA-damage-induced p53 response we investigated the effects of butyrate and the anticancer drug mitomycin C in normal C3H10T1/2 cells harbouring wild-type p53. In comparison with p53-deficient fibroblasts we examined p53 protein level, cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis. Butyrate induced G1 phase arrest, differentiation, and p53-independent increase in p21waf1/cip1 protein. Moreover, butyrate induced p53-independent apoptosis, which was, as well as p53-mediated apoptosis, associated with a dose-dependent increase in Bax and c-Myc protein. Pretreatment with butyrate repressed dose-dependently mitomycin-C-induced p53 accumulation and interfered with p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. Butyrate further partially inhibited p53-mediated apoptosis, but low doses of butyrate were more effective than higher concentrations. This was reflected in an enhanced decrease in c-Myc and Bax protein in response to mitomycin C with low concentrations of butyrate. Our data indicate that the differentiation stimulus of butyrate, in association with p21waf1/cip1 induction, and apoptosis, may explain anti-neoplastic effects of butyrate. Co-carcinogenic features of butyrate may result from inhibition of p53-mediated DNA damage response."
https://openalex.org/W2333591384,"The brk gene encodes a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that consists of single SH3, SH2 and catalytic domains. Although BRK shows strongest sequence similarity to members of the SRC family of PTKs, there are several key structural and regulatory differences that place it on its own amongst non-receptor PTKs. In this study we have isolated genomic DNA clones corresponding to the human brk locus and used these to determine the intron-exon structure of the brk gene. The genomic structure of brk consists of 8 exons, whose boundaries are distinct from other non-receptor PTK family members, again indicating a structural and functional divergence. Alternate splicing of the primary brk transcript generates a distinct mRNA which encodes a truncated protein consisting of an SH3 domain and a novel C-terminal proline rich sequence. Using an antiserum raised to the SH3 domain, we have demonstrated that the product of this alternate brk transcript is expressed in the human breast tumour cell line T-47D. We have previously reported that expression of a tumour derived brk cDNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human mammary epithelial cells supports anchorage independent growth, and in the latter potentiates the mitogenic response to epidermal growth factor. The protein encoded by the genomic sequence derived from normal human tissue is identical to that encoded by the tumour derived cDNA, and therefore the altered growth regulation is not associated with mutations within brk. In addition, we have identified a 5′ genomic region that has promoter activity. The brk gene has been assigned to chromosome 19q 13.3-13.4 using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH)."

Although the molecular mechanism of this cooperative transformation remains unknown, it is speculated that, similar to Bcl-2, Pim-1 contributes to transformation by inhibiting apoptosis. In this study, therefore, we examined the effect of Pim-1 expression on c-Myc-mediated apoptosis of Rat-1 fibroblasts triggered by serum deprivation. Our results showed that, rather than inhibiting apoptosis, Pim-1 expression stimulated c-Myc-mediated apoptosis in Rat-1 fibroblasts. Pim-1 stimulated c-Myc-mediated apoptosis through an enhancement of the c-Myc-mediated activation of caspase-3 (CPP32)-like proteases, since the suppression of this activity by a specific caspase inhibitor abolished the apoptosis stimulation by Pim-1. A kinase-defective Pim-1 mutant failed to stimulate c-Myc-mediated apoptosis, and Pim-1 expression alone in the absence of c-Myc overexpression did not induce apoptosis of serum-deprived Rat-1 cells, indicating that the kinase activity of Pim-1 and the activated c-Myc signaling pathway were required for apoptosis stimulation by Pim-1. Together, these results suggest that Pim-1 oncoprotein stimulates as a serine/threonine kinase the death signaling elicited by c-Myc at a step upstream of caspase-3-like protease activation in Rat-1 fibroblasts. Our results also suggest that Pim-1 kinase might function cooperatively with c-Myc through the phosphorylation of a factor(s) which regulates the common signaling pathway involved in c-Myc-mediated apoptosis and transformation."
