https://openalex.org/W2001310992,A substance isolated from human urine by anion exchange absorption and paper chromatography was found to correspond in its ultraviolet absorption spectrum and chromatographic mobilities with a uridine isomer (5-ribosyluracil) recently described as a component of yeast ribonucleic acid.

https://openalex.org/W1968486205,IT has been found1 that the intragastric administration of optimal quantities of 3-methylcholanthrene induces mammary cancer with great rapidity in females of a susceptible strain of rats under standardized conditions ; all the animals have invariably developed multiple mammary cancers within two months. Sex hormones are of critical significance2 in the induction of mammary cancer by aromatic hydrocarbons. The effects of hyperthyroidism and of thyroidectomy were investigated in the present work.

https://openalex.org/W2328116556,"DURING anæsthesia, and in respiratory research, there is a need to analyse mixtures of permanent gases and organic vapours on a routine basis. Physical methods are being increasingly used for this type of work, but the equipment required tends to become complex when the analysis of several components is desired. Chromatographic analysis is discontinuous in nature, but, provided that this can be tolerated, the use of gas chromatography offers several advantages of which simplicity and versatility are the most important."

https://openalex.org/W1980087480,"NONULOSAMINIC ACID1, a group of simple and substituted 9-carbon sugars containing nitrogen, was thought restricted to mammals until it was found in the supernates of Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii cultures, but not in the supernates of Salmonella, Shigella, Pneumococcus or Bacillus cultures2. Nonulosaminic acid has now been found in the cells of E. coli 3, Neisseria meningitidis, Salmonella dahlem, and S. djkarta 4."

The device is used to demonstrate the perception of apparent or ""induced"" motion. Two methods are successful: (i) toad and food moving together at a constant velocity in a stationary environment; (ii) toad and food stationary with the environment moving. The phenomena are similar to those found in human beings."

The median menopausal age of 33 women questioned within 5 years of their menopause was 48.6 years, and their mean menopausal age was 49.2 years. It is suggested that this may be an effect of malnutrition or of climatic factors."

https://openalex.org/W2028352531,"DEMONSTRATION of circulating thyroglobulin antibodies by the gel diffusion-precipitation technique is a simple procedure which can be used for routine laboratory diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis1. Witebsky and Rose2, Roitt and Doniach1 and Owen and Smart3 have also applied Boyden's tannic acid haemagglutination technique for detection of thyroid antibodies and have demonstrated its greater sensitivity over the precipitation technique. The tannic acid haemagglutination technique is however in our experience, less easy to adapt as a routine procedure because it is complex in its performance and requires minute attention to detail to produce consistent results. A recent report by Bozicevich et al. on the successful use of bentonite particles, coated with human γ-globulin, in the detection of the rheumatoid serum factor prompted us to try this substance sensitized with thyroid antigen in the detection of thyroid antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2064652082,"ALTHOUGH the 5-hydroxytryptamine content of human cerebrospinal fluid has been reported by Sachs1 to increase after various head injuries or cerebral tumours, there appears to be no other reference in the literature to conditions resulting in an alteration in the content. While studying tuberculous meningitis in children, the opportunity arose for the cerebrospinal fluid to be tested for various amines including 5-hydroxytryptamine."
https://openalex.org/W2057358180,THE finding by Fraenkel and Friedman1 that carnitine (4-trimethyl amino 3 hydroxy butyric acid) is an essential growth factor for certain organisms (vitamin BT) and its availability by synthesis have renewed interest in the problem of its biochemical function.
https://openalex.org/W2057733468,"RECENT biochemical studies on succinic dehydrogenase in livers of rats fed with the liver carcinogen p-dimethylaminoazobenzene (DAB) for periods of up to 150 days have confirmed the well-established phenomenon that the level of this enzyme generally falls as feeding progresses (Table 1). Samples of tissue from each liver lobe were taken for histological and histochemical investigations, and the remainder was homogenized. Succinic dehydrogenase was estimated to within an accuracy of ± 10 per cent by the anaerobic methylene blue technique, basing the QMB values on dry weight. For histochemical purposes the tissue was frozen1, stored for not longer than a week, and cut at − 20° C. in a refrigerated microtome. Succinic dehydrogenase was detected higtochemically by incubating frozen sections in a neotetrazolium-succinate buffer system2; in addition, the periodic acid–Schiff method3 was used to stain glycogen, while phospholipid was stained by the acid haematin method4."

https://openalex.org/W2049955721,"IT was shown in a recent paper1 that the zinc content of whole blood in cases of very different cancers was subnormal (a mean decrease of about 20 per cent being found). Various metalloproteins are known which contain zinc as an essential part2. It seems wise to devote careful attention to carbonic anhydrase, a substance present in relatively large amounts in red blood corpuscles and described in detail by Keilin and Mann3."

https://openalex.org/W2009934567,"STUDIES in blood serum mucoproteins have stressed the importance of the alterations of this fraction in various pathological and physiological conditions1 as well as in the administration of certain drugs2. However, only very scant information on the biosynthesis and function of seromucoid is at present available1. It seemed to us that a method for the determination of histomucoid3 would be a practical tool for the study of seromucoid biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2077320698,"A METHOD has been developed for measuring small rapid volume changes occurring in a muscle during a single twitch. In order to achieve the necessary sensitivity and speed of response, a capacitance transducer has been developed which uses a commercially available detector-amplifier circuit (the ‘Dynagage’, from Photocon Products). The changes are displayed on a cathode-ray oscilloscope. Single gastrocnemius and sartorius muscles from Rana pipiens are used."

We observed that in the fifteen animals studied the duration of paralysis of respiratory and other muscle groups became steadily shorter. The work was all done on the intact animal in a warm room. Nitrous oxide in 3 : 1 mixture with oxygen was the sole anaesthetic agent used—thus, in the preliminary stages no drug was involved which was likely to influence the duration of neuromuscular block. D-tubocurarine was administered intravenously in doses of 0.6 mgm./kgm., and during the period of respiratory paralysis artificial respiration was maintained through an endotracheal tube at a rate of 20–25 per min., a soda lime canister being included in the circuit for the absorption of carbon dioxide. In this way adequate oxygenation was maintained throughout all experiments."
