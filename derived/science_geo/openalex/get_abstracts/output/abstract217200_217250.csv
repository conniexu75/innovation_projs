In small ruminants the rate per unit contents is faster than in large ones, due to faster turnover. The cellulolytic bacteria of several ruminants are similar but differ in nutritional requirements."

https://openalex.org/W1982468523,"Local licking rates of eight albino rats, when the rats were given tap water at the end of a short runway after 23 hours of water deprivation, averaged a little over seven licks per second. Small variations within sessions were found, rates being slightly but consistently higher at the beginning than later on in sessions. Inter-session and individual differences were also observed, but were only of theorder of one lick per second. Within practical limits, it appears that licking rates of rats are constant."

Recently, we have succeeded in passing some strains of the viruses of trachoma and inclusion blennorrhœa by this route. Most suitable for the purpose are 5-week-old animals from a closed colony originating from the BSVS strain1. The passages were initiated with infected yolk sac. Cortisone (0.5 mgm. subcutaneously daily, beginning 24 hr. before virus) did not apparently facilitate infection."

https://openalex.org/W2411421662,"FROM the X-ray analysis of horse hæmoglobin by Perutz and his collaborators1,2 and Ingram's examination of the peptides formed by tryptic digestion of human hæmoglobin3, it can be concluded that human hæmoglobin is composed of two identical half-molecules, each containing approximately 280 amino-acids. Rhinesmith, Schroeder and Pauling4 showed that normal adult hæmoglobin (A) consisted of four polypeptide chains of only two types. One of these types—afterwards named α-chain—had a terminal valyl–leucyl residue. The β-chains were identified by Rhinesmith, Schroeder and Martin5 as carrying a terminal valyl–histidyl–leucyl residue. A third type of chain, later named γ-chain, was observed in human fœtal hæmoglobin (F) by Schroeder and Matsuda6. It carried a terminal glycyl residue. The other hæmoglobin F chain, already known to carry a terminal valyl residue6–8, was shown by Hunt9 to be identical with the α-chain of hæmoglobin A."

https://openalex.org/W2022854479,"A ‘NEW’ antibody, anti-M1, has been found as a component in six out of twenty available human anti-M sera : in one of them practically all the antibody was anti-M1. No anti-M1 could be detected in anti-M sera from eight rabbits and from one horse, nor in an extract of the seeds of Iberis amara (which contains anti-M) : nor could it be found in a wide range of other antisera. We are calling the antibody anti-M1, because in several ways it behaves like anti-A1 of the ABO system and anti-P1 of the P system."

https://openalex.org/W1984999905,"Mosinger, Placer and Koldovsky1, in a recent communication, have shown that insulin administered orally to suckling rats 2 and 8 days old causes a large drop in blood-sugar levels, but does not do so in 21- and 30-day old rats. Previously I had found that the gut of the 8-day old mouse is permeable to insulin but that this permeability declines thereafter. This work was quoted by Halliday2 and, although Mosinger et al. refer to that paper, they do not mention my findings."
https://openalex.org/W2067062628,"NUTRITIONAL requirements for carbohydrates in insects have been widely studied1, but not enough in the leaf-eating forms. This is mainly due to the fact that there are difficulties which must be solved before the determination of their nutritional requirements, namely, in devising a suitable test diet. In the silkworm, Bombyx mori, the nutritive value of the mulberry leaves has hitherto been discussed on the basis of the analytical data of leaf components as well as of the rearing experiments of larvæ. Though many efforts have been made to formulate a chemically defined diet for this insect, no suitable one has so far been made available. I have recently tried to determine the nutritive values of carbohydrates for the silkworm by means of oral administration of them."

The centrifuged cells were resuspended in Melnick9s growth medium, diluted to 100 ml for each pair of kidneys, and seeded at 1 ml per tube. The cultures were maintained for 7 days or longer in the medium modified by replacing the serum with tryptose."

https://openalex.org/W2057065534,The electrical output of the receptor membrane of the nonmyelinated ending of Pacinian corpuscles is a function of the electrical gradients across the receptor membrane. The generator potential of the receptor membrane in response to equal mechanical stimuli varies linearly with the intensity of polarizing currents passed through the membrane. The production of a generator potential leaves a refractory state in the receptor membrane which is independent of the amount of charge transferred across the membrane but is dependent on a factor related to the strength of the stimulus which produced the response.

Therefore, a study of the heart and aorta was undertaken."

https://openalex.org/W2089624150,"STRONG evidence was produced1,2 in 1958 that facial eczema of sheep in New Zealand is caused by ingestion of spores of a fungus identified as Sporidesmium bakeri. Lately I carried out experimental work in New Zealand during January–March, 1959, which involved inter alia the isolation of Sporidesmium spores from pasture. On return to Australia a search made of pastures in southern Victoria disclosed the presence of a fungus which appeared superficially identical to the New Zealand Sporidesmium. A culture was forwarded to the Commonwealth Mycological Institute, who report that it is indeed Sporidesmium bakeri."

It would indeed be interesting to obtain similar information on published works in other fields of knowledge."

Consequently a and b are constants in the expression : E = a + bD
−2 The ways in which the total nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid-content have been calculated4–8 demonstrate that the nuclei have been imagined as being homogeneously absorbing objects, that is, objects in which the absorbing particles are randomly distributed, non-interacting and retaining their shape and number. But according to the equation the mass (=deoxyribonucleic acid-content) must remain constant, no synthesis can therefore take place, and this is contradictory to experimental facts. We can therefore conclude that in spite of the finding that the equation describes the data well, it does not mean that the nuclei are homogeneously absorbing objects. A non-random distribution of the Feulgen-stain was observed by DeSmul and LeComte9, and reconstructions of serially cut human and rodent somatic nuclei in this laboratory10 have shown that the Feulgen-stained material and the nucleoli are distributed in a peripheral zone. We can therefore conclude that the absorbing material, that is, deoxyribonucleic acid, is not randomly distributed and consequently that published data on the total nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid content, calculated from cytophotometric measurements of fixed tissue assuming a random distribution of the absorbing particles, are erroneous. The linear relationship between the nuclear absorbance and the inverse nuclear surface area may simply mean that both the absorbance and the geometrical dimensions are dependent variables of a common variable as, for example, the growth process, thus : A practical consequence of this is, as is also evident from the equation, that a simple measurement of the nuclear geometrical dimensions will yield the same information as that obtained by the far more complicated and costly photometric method."
