https://openalex.org/W2073315259,"Carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) is a new transcription factor that binds to the carbohydrate-responsive element of the l-type pyruvate kinase gene (l-PK). The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which feeding high fat diets results in decreased activity of ChREBP in the liver (Yamashita, H., Takenoshita, M., Sakurai, M., Bruick, R. K., Henzel, W. J., Shillinglaw, W., Arnot, D., and Uyeda, K. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 98, 9116–9121). We cloned the rat liver ChREBP gene for use throughout this study. Acetate, octanoate, and palmitate inhibited the glucose-induced activation of l-PK transcription in ChREBP-overexpressed hepatocytes. In these hepatocytes, the cytosolic AMP concentration increased 30-fold and AMP-activated protein kinase activity was activated 2-fold. Similarly to the fatty acids, 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribotide, a specific activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) also inhibited the l-PK transcription activity in ChREBP-overexpressed hepatocytes. Using as a substrate a truncated ChREBP consisting of the C-terminal region, we demonstrated that phosphorylation by AMPK resulted in inactivation of the DNA binding activity. AMPK specifically phosphorylated Ser568 of ChREBP. A S568A mutant of the ChREBP gene showed tight DNA binding and lost its fatty acid sensitivity, whereas a S568D mutant showed weak DNA binding and inhibited l-PK transcription activity even in the absence of fatty acid. These results strongly suggested that the fatty acid inhibition of glucose-induced l-PK transcription resulted from AMPK phosphorylation of ChREBP at Ser568, which inactivated the DNA binding activity. AMPK was activated by the increased AMP that was generated by the fatty acid activation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which feeding high fat diets results in decreased activity of ChREBP in the liver (Yamashita, H., Takenoshita, M., Sakurai, M., Bruick, R.

Fatty acids inhibit genes of key enzymes of glycolysis and lipogenesis such as l-pyruvate kinase (l-PK),1acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid synthetase. l-PK, regulating the flux of metabolites through the pyruvate-phosphoenolpyruvate cycle (4Liimatta M. Towle H.C. Clarke S. Jump D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1147-1153PubMed Google Scholar), is known to play an important role in hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. The activity ofl-PK is subject to acute control by covalent modification and allosteric effectors (5Foufelle F. Girard J. Ferre P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). On the other hand, long term control ofl-PK is achieved by regulating l-PK gene transcription (5Foufelle F. Girard J. Ferre P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fatty acids inhibit transcription ofl-PK and other enzymes in glycolysis and lipogenesis pathways, whereas excess glucose induces expression of these genes (6Duplus E. Glorian M. Forest C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of fatty acid inhibition of transcription is not understood. We recently identified a new transcription factor, which binds specifically to the carbohydrate-responsive element of thel-PK gene, and we have termed this new transcription factor, “carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein” (ChREBP) (7Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). ChREBP is expressed specifically in liver and is responsive to diet. ChREBP is activated by a high carbohydrate diet and inhibited by a high fat diet (7Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). We showed that the DNA binding activity of ChREBP in nuclear extract of livers from rats fed a high fat diet is inhibited compared with those of control rats fed laboratory chow or a high carbohydrate diet, suggesting that ChREBP may be intimately involved in fatty acid inhibition of glucose metabolism.AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a multisubunit protein kinase, which appears to play a central role in lipid metabolism (8Hardie D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1123: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). AMPK was first shown to catalyze phosphorylation and inactivation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, respectively (9Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). AMPK is activated by a high AMP/ATP ratio in the cytosol, which occurs under stressed conditions such as heat shock, hypoxia, arsenite treatment, and starvation (10Moore F. Weekes J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The increase in AMP and the concomitant decrease in ATP, activating AMPK, suggests that this protein kinase inhibits activation of biosynthetic enzymes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase to conserve ATP (11Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar).The objectives of this investigation were to determine: 1) whether our previous observation that the fatty acid inhibition of ChREBP in intact rats by fatty acid feeding was a result of AMPK action; 2) the target site of the phosphorylation; and 3) which processes, the nuclear localization or the DNA binding activity, are affected by fatty acids.DISCUSSIONChREBP, a newly discovered transcription factor, plays an essential role in glucose-induced l-PK gene transcription by binding to the carbohydrate-responsive element of l-PK promoter (7Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 18Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). It is well known that glucose metabolism is inhibited by fatty acids, which serve as an alternative fuel source and thus conserve glucose. This phenomenon has been termed the fat sparing effect on glucose (1Williamson J.R. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1961; 80: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 2Ross B.D. Hems R. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 102: 942-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Struck E. Ashmore J. Wieland O.H. Biochem. J. 1965; 343: 107-110Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that rats fed a high fat diet showed inhibited l-PK transcription, and the DNA binding activity of ChREBP in the nuclear extract of liver was inhibited compared with that of rats fed a high carbohydrate diet (7Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrated that administration of a variety of fatty acids to hepatocytes overexpressing ChREBP resulted in inhibition of the glucose activation of l-PK gene expression (Fig.3).The mechanism of ChREBP inhibition of the glucose activation ofl-PK gene expression by fatty acids appeared to be mediated by phosphorylation of Ser568 by AMPK, which was activated by increased AMP that was produced by the activation of fatty acids catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase (EC 6.2.1.3).Fatty acids+ATP+CoA→acyl­CoAsynthetaseacyl−CoA+AMP+PPiREACTION1AMPK is activated by the increased AMP/ATP ratio in cytoplasm and acts as a key metabolic “master switch” by phosphorylating target proteins involved in lipid metabolism (11Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Evidence that fatty acid inhibition of the glucose activation of ChREBP and l-PK transcription is mediated by phosphorylation by AMPK is as follows: (a) rats fed a high fat diet showed inhibition of the DNA binding activity of ChREBP (7Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar); (b) AMP/ATP ratio increased 30-fold in the cytosol of hepatocytes incubated in the presence of fatty acids (Table I), and under these conditions, AMPK activity in the cell extracts increased 2-fold (Fig. 4); (c) AICAR inhibited both the glucose-induced activation of l-PK transcription in the ChREBP overexpressed hepatocytes (Fig. 5) and the DNA binding activity of ChREBP (Fig. 6); (d) AMPK phosphorylated the synthetic AMPK site peptide specifically at the same rate as that of SAMS peptide in vitro (Fig. 7); and (e) the S568D mutant of ChREBP lost DNA binding activity (Fig. 8B) andl-PK transcription activity (Fig. 8C), even in the presence of high glucose, whereas the S568A mutant was fully active even in the presence of fatty acids.Fatty acid synthesis occurs only under conditions of excess carbohydrate intake, most rapidly during high carbohydrate feeding. To produce the malonyl-CoA required for de novo fatty acid synthesis, glucose must be metabolized in glycolysis to pyruvate, a process requiring the action of pyruvate kinase. After it is formed in cytosol by glycolysis, pyruvate enters the mitochondria to form citrate, which leaves the mitochondria to be converted to cytosolic acetyl-CoA, the necessary precursor of malonyl-CoA. Under these conditions, blood free fatty acids are low. During periods of high fat feeding or during starvation, when free fatty acids are high, fat synthesis is inhibited. It is therefore not surprising that the amount of pyruvate kinase should be decreased by the same processes which decrease the amount of the fatty acid synthesizing enzymes.There are a number of regulatory enzymes of fatty acid, sterols, and isoprenoid syntheses that are regulated by AMPK, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase, HMG-CoA reductase, glycogen synthase, and hormone-sensitive lipase (8Hardie D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1123: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 9Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, 10Moore F. Weekes J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 11Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Dyck et al. (19Dyck J.R. Kudo N. Barr A.J. Davies S.P. Hardie D.G. Lopaschuk G.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) reported that the activation of AMPK leads to inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase by phosphorylation, blocking fatty acid synthesis, an energy-consuming process, and by decreasing intercellular malonyl-CoA, permitting activation of carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase I and fatty acid oxidation to generate energy. Furthermore, some transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ appear to be regulated by AMPK (20Yang Y. Hong Y.H. Shen X. Frankowski C. Camp H.S. Leff T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38341-38344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that AICAR inhibits l-PK transcription, Vaulontet al. (21Vaulont S. Vasseur-Cognet M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31555-31558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) proposed that AMPK is involved in the transcriptional regulation. More recently, they demonstrated that AICAR inhibits transcription of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α in hepatocytes (22Leclerc I. Lenzner C. Gourdon L. Vaulont S. Kahn A. Viollet B. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α binds to the promoter adjacent to the glucose-responsive element of the l-PK gene (23Puzenat N. Vaulont S. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1119-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), it is regulated by AMPK. The results herein demonstrated that the phosphorylation by AMPK resulted in inhibition of the DNA binding activity of ChREBP. Thus, the AMPK inhibition of ChREBP is more direct regulation of l-PK gene transcription.Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of transcription factors have wide-ranging effects such as DNA binding activity, transactivating capacity, and subcellular localization (22Leclerc I. Lenzner C. Gourdon L. Vaulont S. Kahn A. Viollet B. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Glineur C. Davioud C.E. Vandenbunder B. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Katan K.Y. Shaul Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3108-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). ChREBP contains at least three phosphorylation sites for PKA, and two of the sites play important roles in cAMP-mediated inhibition of the glucose-activation of l-PK transcription (18Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These two PKA phosphorylation sites have different regulatory functions. The first site (Ser196), located near the NLS domain, is involved in regulation of nuclear localization of ChREBP, and phosphorylation of the site results in complete inhibition of the nuclear import (18Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The second site (Thr666) is located within the basic residues that are essential in DNA binding and phosphorylation of this site abolishes the DNA binding and the transcriptional activity (18Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The present study added an additional control site of ChREBP that is regulated by nutrients and mediated by AMPK. The phosphorylation of this site (Ser568) by AMPK resulted in inhibition of both the DNA binding activity and transcription of the l-PK gene. Thus, the present observation demonstrated that AMPK plays an important role in down-regulation of ChREBP by phosphorylation of Ser568 under hyperlipidemic conditions. However, because the S568A mutant was still able to mediate ∼45% inhibition of the glucose effect, whereas the wild-type ChREBP mediated 80% inhibition (Fig. 8C), there may be an additional regulatory mechanism of ChREBP under these conditions. Further studies will focus on these additional regulatory mechanisms. Glucose metabolism in liver is inhibited by administration of fatty acids, the so-called “glucose sparing” effect (1Williamson J.R. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1961; 80: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 2Ross B.D. Hems R. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 102: 942-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Struck E. Ashmore J. Wieland O.H.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α binds to the promoter adjacent to the glucose-responsive element of the l-PK gene (23Puzenat N. Vaulont S. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1119-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), it is regulated by AMPK. The results herein demonstrated that the phosphorylation by AMPK resulted in inhibition of the DNA binding activity of ChREBP. Thus, the AMPK inhibition of ChREBP is more direct regulation of l-PK gene transcription.Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of transcription factors have wide-ranging effects such as DNA binding activity, transactivating capacity, and subcellular localization (22Leclerc I. Lenzner C. Gourdon L. Vaulont S. Kahn A. Viollet B. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Glineur C. Davioud C.E. Vandenbunder B. Biochem.

ChREBP contains at least three phosphorylation sites for PKA, and two of the sites play important roles in cAMP-mediated inhibition of the glucose-activation of l-PK transcription (18Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These two PKA phosphorylation sites have different regulatory functions. The first site (Ser196), located near the NLS domain, is involved in regulation of nuclear localization of ChREBP, and phosphorylation of the site results in complete inhibition of the nuclear import (18Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The second site (Thr666) is located within the basic residues that are essential in DNA binding and phosphorylation of this site abolishes the DNA binding and the transcriptional activity (18Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The present study added an additional control site of ChREBP that is regulated by nutrients and mediated by AMPK. The phosphorylation of this site (Ser568) by AMPK resulted in inhibition of both the DNA binding activity and transcription of the l-PK gene. Thus, the present observation demonstrated that AMPK plays an important role in down-regulation of ChREBP by phosphorylation of Ser568 under hyperlipidemic conditions. However, because the S568A mutant was still able to mediate ∼45% inhibition of the glucose effect, whereas the wild-type ChREBP mediated 80% inhibition (Fig. 8C), there may be an additional regulatory mechanism of ChREBP under these conditions. Further studies will focus on these additional regulatory mechanisms. ChREBP, a newly discovered transcription factor, plays an essential role in glucose-induced l-PK gene transcription by binding to the carbohydrate-responsive element of l-PK promoter (7Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 18Kawaguchi T. Takenoshita M. Kabashima T. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). It is well known that glucose metabolism is inhibited by fatty acids, which serve as an alternative fuel source and thus conserve glucose. This phenomenon has been termed the fat sparing effect on glucose (1Williamson J.R. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1961; 80: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 2Ross B.D. Hems R. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 102: 942-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Struck E. Ashmore J. Wieland O.H. Biochem. J. 1965; 343: 107-110Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that rats fed a high fat diet showed inhibited l-PK transcription, and the DNA binding activity of ChREBP in the nuclear extract of liver was inhibited compared with that of rats fed a high carbohydrate diet (7Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrated that administration of a variety of fatty acids to hepatocytes overexpressing ChREBP resulted in inhibition of the glucose activation of l-PK gene expression (Fig.3). The mechanism of ChREBP inhibition of the glucose activation ofl-PK gene expression by fatty acids appeared to be mediated by phosphorylation of Ser568 by AMPK, which was activated by increased AMP that was produced by the activation of fatty acids catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase (EC 6.2.1.3).Fatty acids+ATP+CoA→acyl­CoAsynthetaseacyl−CoA+AMP+PPiREACTION1AMPK is activated by the increased AMP/ATP ratio in cytoplasm and acts as a key metabolic “master switch” by phosphorylating target proteins involved in lipid metabolism (11Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Evidence that fatty acid inhibition of the glucose activation of ChREBP and l-PK transcription is mediated by phosphorylation by AMPK is as follows: (a) rats fed a high fat diet showed inhibition of the DNA binding activity of ChREBP (7Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar); (b) AMP/ATP ratio increased 30-fold in the cytosol of hepatocytes incubated in the presence of fatty acids (Table I), and under these conditions, AMPK activity in the cell extracts increased 2-fold (Fig. 4); (c) AICAR inhibited both the glucose-induced activation of l-PK transcription in the ChREBP overexpressed hepatocytes (Fig. 5) and the DNA binding activity of ChREBP (Fig. 6); (d) AMPK phosphorylated the synthetic AMPK site peptide specifically at the same rate as that of SAMS peptide in vitro (Fig. 7); and (e) the S568D mutant of ChREBP lost DNA binding activity (Fig. 8B) andl-PK transcription activity (Fig. 8C), even in the presence of high glucose, whereas the S568A mutant was fully active even in the presence of fatty acids. Fatty acid synthesis occurs only under conditions of excess carbohydrate intake, most rapidly during high carbohydrate feeding. To produce the malonyl-CoA required for de novo fatty acid synthesis, glucose must be metabolized in glycolysis to pyruvate, a process requiring the action of pyruvate kinase. After it is formed in cytosol by glycolysis, pyruvate enters the mitochondria to form citrate, which leaves the mitochondria to be converted to cytosolic acetyl-CoA, the necessary precursor of malonyl-CoA. Under these conditions, blood free fatty acids are low. During periods of high fat feeding or during starvation, when free fatty acids are high, fat synthesis is inhibited. It is therefore not surprising that the amount of pyruvate kinase should be decreased by the same processes which decrease the amount of the fatty acid synthesizing enzymes. There are a number of regulatory enzymes of fatty acid, sterols, and isoprenoid syntheses that are regulated by AMPK, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase, HMG-CoA reductase, glycogen synthase, and hormone-sensitive lipase (8Hardie D.G.

Biochem. 1999; 262: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) reported that the activation of AMPK leads to inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase by phosphorylation, blocking fatty acid synthesis, an energy-consuming process, and by decreasing intercellular malonyl-CoA, permitting activation of carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase I and fatty acid oxidation to generate energy. Furthermore, some transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ appear to be regulated by AMPK (20Yang Y. Hong Y.H. Shen X. Frankowski C. Camp H.S. Leff T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38341-38344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that AICAR inhibits l-PK transcription, Vaulontet al. (21Vaulont S.

In searching the human genome for protein arginine N-methyltransferase (PRMT) family members, a novel gene has been found on chromosome 1 that encodes for an apparent methyltransferase, PRMT6. The polypeptide chain of PRMT6 is 41.9 kDa consisting of a catalytic core sequence common to other PRMT enzymes. Expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein, PRMT6 demonstrates type I PRMT activity, capable of forming both ω-NG-monomethylarginine and asymmetric ω-NG,NG-dimethylarginine derivatives on the recombinant glycine- and arginine-rich substrate in a processive manner with a specific activity of 144 pmol methyl groups transferred min−1 mg−1 enzyme. A comparison of substrate specificity reveals that PRMT6 is functionally distinct from two previously characterized type I enzymes, PRMT1 and PRMT4. In addition, PRMT6 displays automethylation activity; it is the first PRMT to do so.

The recent sequencing of the entire human genome and its public availability has provided a first glimpse at all of the genes coding for a variety of protein families (39Lander E.S. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17604) Google Scholar, 40Venter J.C. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10498) Google Scholar). In searching the human genome for PRMT family members, a novel gene coding for what appears to be the sixth known human PRMT enzyme was identified. A recombinantly expressed form of this new PRMT, referred to now as PRMT6, exhibits type I PRMT activity and can methylate itself. PRMT6 does not recognize the same substrates as PRMT4/CARM1 and displays limited substrate overlap with PRMT1. As a GFP fusion protein, PRMT6 resides in the nucleus of HeLa cells along with PRMT1, PRMT2, and PRMT4, whereas PRMT3 and PRMT5 GFP fusions localize exclusively to the cytoplasm. To obtain the full-length sequence of PRMT6, we used the reported partial human kidney expressed sequence tag BC002729 (GenBankTM) to engineer primers for 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The first primer sequence was 5′-GGA CCG AAA CGT CCG AGT AGC ATC G-3′, and the second “nested” primer sequence was 5′-TGG TCC CGT TCC CGC TTA GTC CTC CG-3′. We used kidney RACE-Ready cDNA® (Ambion) to isolate the 5′ coding region of PRMT6. Full-length PRMT6 was amplified by the PCR from human kidney cDNA using the following oligonucleotide set: 5′-CAT GGA TCC ATG TCG CAG CCC AAG AAA AGA AAG C-3′ and 5′-TGA GAA TTC TCA GTC CTC CAT GGC AAA GTC-3′. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with BamHI andEcoRI and subcloned in-frame into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pGEX-6P1 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). A human poly(A)+ RNA blot (Origene Technologies, Inc.) was probed with DNA corresponding to the open reading frames of PRMT1 and PRMT6, which were liberated from the appropriate GST fusion vectors by restriction enzyme digestion. DNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using a Prime-it II® kit (Stratagene, Inc.). Northern blot analysis was performed following standard procedures described in Ref. 41Ausubel F.M. Brent R.

Probed blots were exposed overnight at −80 °C. GST-PRMT6 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli DH5α cells (Invitrogen) by induction with a final concentration of 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Washed cells were resuspended in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) and 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/g of cells and subsequently broken by four 30-s sonicator pulses (50% duty; setting 4) on ice with a Sonifier cell disruptor W-350 (SmithKline Corp.). The resulting lysate was centrifuged for 40 min at 23,000 × g at 4 °C. The GST fusion protein was then batch-purified from extracts by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and washed in PBS per the manufacturer's instructions in the presence of 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The purified proteins were eluted from the beads with 30 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, and 2% glycerol. pGEX-PRMT1 (13Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI andSalI, and the resulting 1.1-kb fragment was cloned into theBglII and SalI sites of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Inc.). The PRMT2 gene was PCR-amplified from human expressed sequence tags T77642 and T75034 to yield a single 1.3-kb product with the primer set: 5′-GAG CCT AAG GGA TCC ATG GCA ACA TCA GGT-3′ and 5′-C CAA ATA AAG CAT GAA TTC TCA TCT CCA G-3′. The PRMT2 PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to make pGEX-PRMT2. The coding region of PRMT2 was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotide set: 5′-CGT GGA TCC GCA ACA TCA GGT GAC TGT CCC-3′ and 5′-CTA GAA TTC AAC TGT CAT CTC CAG-3′. pGEX-PRMT2 was used as a template, and the amplified band of 1.3 kb was digested withBamHI and EcoRI and cloned into theBglII and EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1. pGEX-PRMT3 (15Frankel A. Clarke S. J. Biol.

The amplified band of 1.8 kb was digested with BglII and HindIII and cloned into the BglII and HindIII sites of pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH, Inc.). Using the restriction enzymesBamHI and ApaI, PRMT5 was shuttled from the pTKB175 vector (a gift from Sidney Pestka at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School) to the SuperLinker® vector (pSL301) (Invitrogen). pSL301-PRMT5 was digested with BamHI and SalI, and the resulting 2.2-kb fragment was cloned into the BglII and SalI sites of pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH, Inc.). pGEX-PRMT6 (see above) was digested with BamHI andEcoRI, and the resulting 1.3-kb fragment was cloned into theBglII and EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1. A modification of the Lowry procedure was used to determine protein concentrations of GST fusions and AdOx-treated RAT1 cell extracts following precipitation with 1.0 ml of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (43Bailey J. Techniques in Protein Chemistry.2nd Ed. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1967Google Scholar). A stock solution of bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard. GST-GAR has been described previously (1Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST-Npl3 was a gift from Pam Silver and was described previously (38Weiss V.H. McBride A.E. Soriano M.A. Filman D.J. Silver P.A. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct.

GST-PABPf harbors 100 amino acids of the PABP1 protein, and the expression construct was generated by PCR from a HeLa cell cDNA template using the following oligonucleotide set: 5′-TGC GGA TCC GCA AGT GTA CGA GCT GTT CCC-3′ and 5′-TAA GAA TTC TTA ACG CTG TGT TGA CAT GAC TCG-3′. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGex-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). GST fusion proteins were prepared as described above. Recombinant forms of these protein substrates often undergo partial proteolysis during the course of their purification and consequently appear as either a smear or multiple bands on SDS-PAGE gels. The preparation of AdOx-treated and untreated RAT1 extracts and their subsequent pretreatment with bovine pancreatic RNase A (10 mg/ml; Sigma) has been described previously (15Frankel A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32974-32982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). All methylation reactions were carried out in the presence ofS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine ([3H]AdoMet; 79 Ci/mmol from a 12.6 μmstock solution in dilute HCl/ethanol 9:1, pH 2.0–2.5; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and PBS (described above). Additional information pertaining to reaction conditions is described in each of the figure legends. After the assay, an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1.43 m2-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 24% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue) was added to the reaction, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and separated on slab gels prepared from 8.0% (w/v) acrylamide, 1.4% (w/v)N,N-methylenebisacrylamide (1.5-mm − 10.5-cm resolving gel) using the buffer system described by Laemmli (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar) at a constant current of 35 mA for ∼4 h (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, the gels were stained in Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 20–30 min, destained in a 10% methanol (v/v), 5% acetic acid (v/v) solution to visualize protein bands, and then soaked in EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per the manufacturer's instructions. Gels were dried in vacuo, and radioactivity was visualized by fluorography (gels were exposed to film at −80 °C for the times indicated in the figure legends). Methylation reactions were quenched by the addition of 30 μl of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid to precipitate proteins in 6 × 50-mm glass vials. Precipitated proteins were centrifuged at 4000 ×g for 40 min at 25 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were washed once with an equal volume of cold acetone (−20 °C). After an additional centrifugation for 20 min, the acetone was discarded, and the pellets were allowed to dry. Acid hydrolysis was carried out on the dried pellet in a Waters Pico-Tag vapor-phase apparatus containing 200 μl of 6 n HCl for 20 h in vacuo at 110 °C. The hydrolyzed samples were resuspended in 100 μl of water mixed with 1 μmol each of ω-NG-monomethylarginine (Sigma product M7033; acetate salt) and asymmetric ω-NG,NG-dimethylarginine (Sigma product D4268; hydrochloride) as standards. Hydrolyzed amino acids and standards were loaded onto a Beckman AA-15 sulfonated polystyrene cation exchange column (0.9 cm × 11 cm) that was pre-equilibrated with Na+ citrate buffer (0.35m in Na+, pH 5.27) at 55 °C and regenerated with 0.2 n NaOH. Approximately 1 ml/min column fractions were collected for analysis. 3H radioactivity was detected by adding 200 μl from each fraction to 400 μl of water, mixing with 5 ml of fluor, and counting on a scintillation counter. Unlabeled methylarginine standards were detected by analyzing 100 μl of every other fraction by a ninhydrin method described previously (44Gary J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4076-4087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The PRMT family of enzymes exhibits amino acid conservation within the characteristic methyltransferase motifs I, post-I, II, and III (45Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. J. Biol.

A search of the publicly available human genome sequence (39Lander E.S. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17604) Google Scholar) using the gapped BLAST method (46Altshul S.F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59448) Google Scholar) provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information for sequences that match known PRMT sequences identified a novel locus (AK001421) cited as coding for the 316-amino acid hypothetical protein FLJ10559. A GST fusion protein of this hypothetical protein was generated and found to display no arginine methyltransferase activity when assayed on a number of PRMT1 and PRMT4 substrates (data not shown). Upon further scrutiny of the DNA sequence, we identified similarities between a region upstream of the sequence encoding the predicted initiator methionine and those encoding the common N terminus of the PRMT family of proteins, suggesting that a portion of the N-terminal end of the predicted protein was missing. To obtain the complete open reading frame we performed 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends on human kidney cDNA and identified additional 5′ sequence. The newly obtained open reading frame codes for a 375-amino acid protein, now referred to as PRMT6. The recombinant form of PRMT6 is an active enzyme (see below). It has a calculated polypeptide molecular mass of 41.9 kDa and is 46% identical to a putative PRMT in Arabidopsis thaliana (BAB01859) as its closest homologue. The alignment of the common sequences shared by all human PRMT family members is shown in Fig. 1. PRMT6 shares with other PRMTs conserved amino acid sequences within the AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase motifs I, post-I, II, and III, as well as amino acids outside of the these regions with some notable exceptions (45Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 814-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Table I lists the percentage of identity shared between each catalytic core portion of all PRMTs. PRMT6 is most similar to PRMT2 in the catalytic core region, sharing 38% sequence identity; however, it does not contain an N-terminal Src homology 3 domain found in the PRMT2 sequence. Much like PRMT1, PRMT6 is comprised solely of the PRMT catalytic core without any additional domains.Table ISequence identity between all PRMT family membersPRMT catalytic core sequence identityPRMT1PRMT2PRMT3PRMT4PRMT5PRMT6%PRMT11003451351834PRMT23410037352338PRMT35137100321734PRMT43535321002936PRMT51823172910028PRMT63438343628100The percentage of identity in the conserved catalytic core shared between all PRMT family members is listed.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59448) Google Scholar). Northern analysis of PRMT6 reveals that it is highly expressed in kidney and testes (Fig.2A). When compared, the expression levels of PRMT1 and PRMT6 display some degree of tissue specificity. In addition, at least 80 expressed sequence tags from a variety of different tissues have been identified for PRMT6, and a virtual Northern blot (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SAGE/sagevn.cgi) generated from a serial analysis of gene expression tag at the 3′ end of the PRMT6 cDNA sequence also suggests a broad expression pattern for this transcript. The hybridized band in the PRMT6 Northern blot was more diffuse than that displayed by PRMT1 (Fig. 2, A andB), suggesting that PRMT6 may run as two transcripts of similar size. Indeed, when we performed Northern analysis on an RNA sample subjected to an extended separation, we do see two bands (2.4 and 2.6 kb) for PRMT6 (Fig. 2C). A comparison of human PRMT6 expressed sequence tags revealed no alternative splicing events, implying that the two transcripts may arise from different lengths of 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions. Several PRMTs have been shown to catalyze type I methylation of arginine residues within proteins; these enzymes include PRMT1 (10Lin W.J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

To determine the type of activity of PRMT6, GST-PRMT6 was assayed for methyltransferase activity using GST-GAR as a substrate. The fusion protein is able to catalyze the formation of both ω-NG-monomethylarginine and asymmetric ω-NG,NG-dimethylarginine, thus substantiating that PRMT6 is a type I enzyme, as shown in Fig.3A. We find a specific activity of 144 ± 11 pmol methyl groups transferred min−1 mg−1 PRMT6 (Fig. 3B). The total incorporation is linear during the 60-min assay. As expected, we observe an initial accumulation of the monomethyl species followed by a greater rate of accumulation of the final dimethylarginine product (Fig. 3B). Because the amount of available RG sites on the GST-GAR substrate (1800 pmol) is much larger than the total accumulation of methylarginine seen at 60 min (10.9 pmol), it appears that this reaction is processive. Otherwise, we would expect predominantly ω-NG-monomethylarginine to form within this time period because the enzyme would catalyze a single methylation reaction and then release its protein substrate. Two distinct classes of in vitro protein substrates have been described for protein arginineN-methyltransferases: those that are methylated by PRMT1 (and PRMT3) and those that are methylated by PRMT4 (5Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). As a new member of the PRMT family, PRMT6 was tested for its substrate specificity using as methyl acceptors the known PRMT1 substrates GST-GAR and the yeast protein Npl3, as well as a PRMT4 substrate, PABPf, which is a 100-amino acid region of PABP1 that was identified in a screen for PRMT4 substrates. 2Mark T.

https://openalex.org/W2067033621,"Our previous results have indicated that the major cellular pool of sphingomyelin present on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is not involved in the ceramide pathway of apoptosis. Thus, in this study we aimed at defining which intracellular pools of sphingomyelin and ceramide are involved in cell death. The bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) gene fused with green fluorescent protein was subcloned into mammalian vectors containing sequences that target the fusion proteins to cytoplasm, plasma membrane, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, or nucleus. Transfection of MCF7 breast cancer cells showed for all constructs an increase in SMase activity ranging from 2- to 60-fold, concomitant with an increase in total cellular ceramide levels (10-100%) as compared with vector-transfected cells. Next, the effect of overexpression of the SMase on cell death was examined. Results demonstrate that only when bacterial SMase was targeted to mitochondria did cells undergo apoptosis; its targeting to the other intracellular compartments was ineffective. Further, the results show that apoptosis induced by mitochondrial targeting of bacterial SMase requires SMase catalytic activity, is prevented by the overexpression of Bcl-2, and is mediated by inducing cytochrome c release. These results demonstrate that ceramide induces cell death specifically when generated in mitochondria. The results highlight the significance of compartment-specific lipid-mediated cell regulation, and they offer a novel general approach for these studies."

Recent studies have revealed that galectin-3 suppresses apoptosis and anoikis that contribute to cell survival during metastatic cascades. Previously, it has been shown that human galectin-3 undergoes post-translational signaling modification of Ser6 phosphorylation that acts as an “on/off” switch for its sugar-binding capability. We questioned whether galectin-3 phosphorylation is required for its anti-apoptotic function. Serine to alanine (S6A) and serine to glutamic acid (S6E) mutations were produced at the casein kinase I phosphorylation site in galectin-3. The cDNAs were transfected into a breast carcinoma cell line BT-549 that innately expresses no galectin-3. Metabolic labeling revealed that only wild type galectin-3 undergoes phosphorylation in vivo. Expression of Ser6 mutants of galectin-3 failed to protect cells from cisplatin-induced cell death and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase from degradation when compared with wild type galectin-3. The non-phosphorylated galectin-3 mutants failed to protect cells from anoikis with G1 arrest when cells were cultured in suspension. In response to a loss of cell-substrate interactions, only cells expressing wild type galectin-3 down-regulated cyclin A expression and up-regulated cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, i.e.p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 expression levels.

Due to the functional anti-death mimicking of Bcl-2 and Gal-3 and the fact that both undergo post-translational modification of serine phosphorylation, we questioned the role of Gal-3 phosphorylation in its anti-apoptotic activity.In 3T3 fibroblasts, quiescent cells express phosphorylated Gal-3 both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, whereas proliferating cells show an increased level of phosphorylated Gal-3 ratio in the cytoplasm (24Cowles E.A. Agrwal N. Anderson R.L. Wang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17706-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also shown that canine Gal-3 is phosphorylated at the NH2-terminal Ser6 (major) and Ser12(minor) (25Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the major acidic residues on both sides of Ser6 make it a substrate for casein kinase I and /or for casein kinase II (24Cowles E.A. Agrwal N. Anderson R.L. Wang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17706-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human Gal-3 undergoes phosphorylation by casein kinase I only at Ser6, and the phosphorylation significantly reduces its binding ability to its ligands,e.g. laminin and asialomucin, whereas dephosphorylation fully restores the sugar binding activity (26Mazurek N. Conklin J. Byrd J.C. Raz A. Bresalier R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36311-36315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), implying that phosphorylation of Gal-3 at Ser6 serves as an “on/off” switch for its sugar-binding capabilities. The function of Gal-3 phosphorylation to its other biological activities, however, remained unknown.We investigate the cellular function of Gal-3 phosphorylation and its impact on apoptosis. Gal-3 mutants generated by site-directed mutagenesis were transfected into the breast carcinoma BT-549 cells that are Gal-3 null. Ser6 mutation resulted in loss of Gal-3 anti-apoptotic activity and its involvement in cell cycle arrest in response to loss of cell-substrate interactions as compared with the wild type species.DISCUSSIONThe β-galactoside-binding lectin Gal-3 plays a central role on diverse biological functions including regulation of apoptosis. The post-translational modification of Gal-3 by phosphorylation regulates its carbohydrate recognition (24Cowles E.A. Agrwal N. Anderson R.L. Wang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17706-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using site-directed mutagenesis have shed new light on diverse protein functions (2Gong H.C. Honjo Y.

Cell Biol. 2000; 11: 819-825Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar); thus we employed this method to gain an insight into the relationship between Gal-3 phosphorylation and its biological function. From the data, we have concluded that Gal-3 phosphorylation is required for its anti-apoptotic activity and anti-anoikis activity with G1 cell cycle arrest.It is now well established that Gal-3 overexpression correlates with increased metastatic potential in some cancers (1Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N.W. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Raz A. Zhu D. Hogan V. Shah N. Raz T. Karkash R. Pazerini G. Carmi P. Int. J.

Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Gal-3 may render this property to tumor cells by its anti-apoptotic and anti-anoikis activities, which are thought to be critical for anchorage-independent cell survival in the circulation during dissemination. We show that the anti-death activity of Gal-3 is regulated by its phosphorylation. Moreover, the enhanced metastatic potential related to Gal-3 overexpression seems to be promoted by the property that cell surface Gal-3 mediates homotypic cell aggregation and tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cells and to extracellular matrix through binding with its complementary glycoconjugates, which is also regulated by its post-translational modification, i.e.Ser6 phosphorylation of human Gal-3 significantly reduces the saturation binding to its complementary glycoconjugates and dephosphorylation fully restores the binding (5Inohara H.

Taken together, Gal-3 phosphorylation may play a pivotal role in the biological function of Gal-3.Although Gal-3 does not belong to the Bcl-2 family, it contains sequence and functional similarities to Bcl-2; Gal-3 has the four amino acid anti-death motif (Asp-Trp-Gly-Arg) that is highly conserved within the BH1 domain of the Bcl-2 family (9Yang R.-Y.

These contradictory conclusions may result from the fact that these studies were performed using different types of tumor cells and apoptotic signals or from the fact that multiple kinases have been implicated in the phosphorylation of Bcl-2, including Raf-1 kinase (22Blagosklonny M.V.

Cell Biol. 2000; 11: 819-825Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the human Gal-3 is phosphorylated at Ser6by casein kinase I (25Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mazurek N. Conklin J. Byrd J.C. Raz A. Bresalier R.S. J. Biol.

Casein kinase I was shown to phosphorylate tumor necrosis factor receptor, which negatively regulates receptor-mediated tumor necrosis factor signaling for apoptosis (33Beyart R. Vanhaesebroeck B.

Furthermore, casein kinase I was suggested to be a conserved component of the Wnt pathway (34McKay R.M. Peters J.M. Graff J.M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and to be a positive regulator of this pathway and a link between upstream signals and the complexes that regulate β-catenin (35Sakanaka C. Leong P., Xu, L. Harrison S.D. Williams L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Casein kinase I might also act in the β-catenin-independent pathway (36McKay R.M. Peters J.M. Graff J.M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that Wnt signaling can inhibit drug-induced apoptosis suggesting that it may exhibit its oncogenic potential through a mechanism of anti-apoptosis (37). Thus, it appears that casein kinase I plays a role in regulation of apoptotic function of diverse molecules and signaling pathways.We demonstrated here that Gal-3 also modulates its anti-apoptotic activity and cell cycle arrest in response to a loss of cell-substrate interactions via its phosphorylation. Thus, the finding of a new similarity in post-translational modification between Gal-3 and Bcl-2 should lead to further understanding of regulation of Gal-3 signaling. Taken together, these finding indicate that the regulation of Gal-3 phosphorylation transduces signal(s) for carbohydrate binding and anti-apoptotic function. Galectins are a family of carbohydrate-binding proteins defined by affinity for β-galactoside and sequence homology of the carbohydrate-binding motif (1Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N.W.

Due to the functional anti-death mimicking of Bcl-2 and Gal-3 and the fact that both undergo post-translational modification of serine phosphorylation, we questioned the role of Gal-3 phosphorylation in its anti-apoptotic activity. In 3T3 fibroblasts, quiescent cells express phosphorylated Gal-3 both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, whereas proliferating cells show an increased level of phosphorylated Gal-3 ratio in the cytoplasm (24Cowles E.A. Agrwal N. Anderson R.L. Wang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17706-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also shown that canine Gal-3 is phosphorylated at the NH2-terminal Ser6 (major) and Ser12(minor) (25Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the major acidic residues on both sides of Ser6 make it a substrate for casein kinase I and /or for casein kinase II (24Cowles E.A. Agrwal N. Anderson R.L. Wang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17706-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human Gal-3 undergoes phosphorylation by casein kinase I only at Ser6, and the phosphorylation significantly reduces its binding ability to its ligands,e.g. laminin and asialomucin, whereas dephosphorylation fully restores the sugar binding activity (26Mazurek N. Conklin J. Byrd J.C. Raz A. Bresalier R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36311-36315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), implying that phosphorylation of Gal-3 at Ser6 serves as an “on/off” switch for its sugar-binding capabilities. The function of Gal-3 phosphorylation to its other biological activities, however, remained unknown. We investigate the cellular function of Gal-3 phosphorylation and its impact on apoptosis. Gal-3 mutants generated by site-directed mutagenesis were transfected into the breast carcinoma BT-549 cells that are Gal-3 null. Ser6 mutation resulted in loss of Gal-3 anti-apoptotic activity and its involvement in cell cycle arrest in response to loss of cell-substrate interactions as compared with the wild type species. DISCUSSIONThe β-galactoside-binding lectin Gal-3 plays a central role on diverse biological functions including regulation of apoptosis. The post-translational modification of Gal-3 by phosphorylation regulates its carbohydrate recognition (24Cowles E.A. Agrwal N. Anderson R.L. Wang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17706-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using site-directed mutagenesis have shed new light on diverse protein functions (2Gong H.C. Honjo Y.

From the data, we have concluded that Gal-3 phosphorylation is required for its anti-apoptotic activity and anti-anoikis activity with G1 cell cycle arrest.It is now well established that Gal-3 overexpression correlates with increased metastatic potential in some cancers (1Barondes S.H.

Gal-3 may render this property to tumor cells by its anti-apoptotic and anti-anoikis activities, which are thought to be critical for anchorage-independent cell survival in the circulation during dissemination. We show that the anti-death activity of Gal-3 is regulated by its phosphorylation. Moreover, the enhanced metastatic potential related to Gal-3 overexpression seems to be promoted by the property that cell surface Gal-3 mediates homotypic cell aggregation and tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cells and to extracellular matrix through binding with its complementary glycoconjugates, which is also regulated by its post-translational modification, i.e.Ser6 phosphorylation of human Gal-3 significantly reduces the saturation binding to its complementary glycoconjugates and dephosphorylation fully restores the binding (5Inohara H.

Taken together, Gal-3 phosphorylation may play a pivotal role in the biological function of Gal-3.Although Gal-3 does not belong to the Bcl-2 family, it contains sequence and functional similarities to Bcl-2; Gal-3 has the four amino acid anti-death motif (Asp-Trp-Gly-Arg) that is highly conserved within the BH1 domain of the Bcl-2 family (9Yang R.-Y.

Casein kinase I was shown to phosphorylate tumor necrosis factor receptor, which negatively regulates receptor-mediated tumor necrosis factor signaling for apoptosis (33Beyart R. Vanhaesebroeck B.

Furthermore, casein kinase I was suggested to be a conserved component of the Wnt pathway (34McKay R.M. Peters J.M. Graff J.M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and to be a positive regulator of this pathway and a link between upstream signals and the complexes that regulate β-catenin (35Sakanaka C. Leong P., Xu, L. Harrison S.D. Williams L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Casein kinase I might also act in the β-catenin-independent pathway (36McKay R.M. Peters J.M. Graff J.M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that Wnt signaling can inhibit drug-induced apoptosis suggesting that it may exhibit its oncogenic potential through a mechanism of anti-apoptosis (37). Thus, it appears that casein kinase I plays a role in regulation of apoptotic function of diverse molecules and signaling pathways.We demonstrated here that Gal-3 also modulates its anti-apoptotic activity and cell cycle arrest in response to a loss of cell-substrate interactions via its phosphorylation. Thus, the finding of a new similarity in post-translational modification between Gal-3 and Bcl-2 should lead to further understanding of regulation of Gal-3 signaling. Taken together, these finding indicate that the regulation of Gal-3 phosphorylation transduces signal(s) for carbohydrate binding and anti-apoptotic function. The β-galactoside-binding lectin Gal-3 plays a central role on diverse biological functions including regulation of apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2060669063,"Caveolae are flask-shaped invaginations at the plasma membrane that constitute a subclass of detergent-resistant membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids and that express caveolin, a caveolar coat protein. Autocrine motility factor receptor (AMF-R) is stably localized to caveolae, and the cholesterol extracting reagent, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, inhibits its internalization to the endoplasmic reticulum implicating caveolae in this distinct receptor-mediated endocytic pathway. Curiously, the rate of methyl-β-cyclodextrin-sensitive endocytosis of AMF-R to the endoplasmic reticulum is increased in ras- andabl-transformed NIH-3T3 cells that express significantly reduced levels of caveolin and few caveolae. Overexpression of the dynamin K44A dominant negative mutant via an adenovirus expression system induces caveolar invaginations sensitive to methyl-β-cyclodextrin extraction in the transformed cells without increasing caveolin expression. Dynamin K44A expression further inhibits AMF-R-mediated endocytosis to the endoplasmic reticulum in untransformed and transformed NIH-3T3 cells. Adenoviral expression of caveolin-1 also induces caveolae in the transformed NIH-3T3 cells and reduces AMF-R-mediated endocytosis to the endoplasmic reticulum to levels observed in untransformed NIH-3T3 cells. Cholesterol-rich detergent-resistant membrane domains or glycolipid rafts therefore invaginate independently of caveolin-1 expression to form endocytosis-competent caveolar vesicles via rapid dynamin-dependent detachment from the plasma membrane. Caveolin-1 stabilizes the plasma membrane association of caveolae and thereby acts as a negative regulator of the caveolae-mediated endocytosis of AMF-R to the endoplasmic reticulum. Caveolae are flask-shaped invaginations at the plasma membrane that constitute a subclass of detergent-resistant membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids and that express caveolin, a caveolar coat protein. Autocrine motility factor receptor (AMF-R) is stably localized to caveolae, and the cholesterol extracting reagent, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, inhibits its internalization to the endoplasmic reticulum implicating caveolae in this distinct receptor-mediated endocytic pathway. Curiously, the rate of methyl-β-cyclodextrin-sensitive endocytosis of AMF-R to the endoplasmic reticulum is increased in ras- andabl-transformed NIH-3T3 cells that express significantly reduced levels of caveolin and few caveolae. Overexpression of the dynamin K44A dominant negative mutant via an adenovirus expression system induces caveolar invaginations sensitive to methyl-β-cyclodextrin extraction in the transformed cells without increasing caveolin expression. Dynamin K44A expression further inhibits AMF-R-mediated endocytosis to the endoplasmic reticulum in untransformed and transformed NIH-3T3 cells.

Autocrine motility factor receptor (AMF-R) is a seven-transmembrane domain receptor localized at steady state to caveolae and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that follows an endocytic pathway sensi- tive to cholesterol extraction with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβCD) via caveolae to the smooth ER (43Benlimame N.

Adenoviral expression of the dominant negative dynK44A mutant or of caveolin-1 has allowed us to demonstrate that: 1) even when caveolin levels are significantly reduced or absent, caveolae form and rapidly bud from the plasma membrane to form caveolar vesicles that target the ER; and 2) caveolin-1 regulates this endocytic pathway by stabilizing caveolae expression at the plasma membrane thereby slowing down the internalization of caveolar vesicles.

Similar to furin-like proprotein convertases, MT1-MMP directly processes a single chain precursor of αvintegrin subunit (pro-αv) into the heavy and light α-chains connected by a disulfide bridge. To evaluate functionality of MT1-MMP-processed integrins, we examined breast carcinoma MCF7 cells co-expressing αvβ3 integrin with either the wild type or mutant MT1-MMP in a variety of migration and adhesion tests. Specific inhibitors of proprotein convertases and MMP were employed in our cell system to attenuate the individual pathways of pro-αv maturation. We present evidence that MT1-MMP cleavage of pro-αv in the cells did not affect RGD-ligand binding of the resulting αvβ3 integrin but enhanced outside-in signal transduction through a focal adhesion kinase pathway. Enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase in cells co-expressing MT1-MMP and αvβ3integrin contributed to efficient adhesion and, especially, migration of cells on vitronectin, a ligand of αvβ3integrin. These mechanisms underscore the significance of a coordinated interplay between MT1-MMP and αvβ3 integrin in tumor cells and identify downstream signaling pathways resulting from their interactions.

Binding of ligands to integrins transmits signals into the cell and results in cytoskeletal rearrangements, gene expression, and cellular differentiation (outside-in signaling). Signals from within the cell can also propagate through integrins and regulate integrin-ligand binding and cell adhesion (inside-out signaling) (12Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3816) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of integrins plays a pivotal role in these bi-directional signaling processes (13Liu S.

It has been established that similar to certain other integrin types, the mature αv integrin subunit is generated by post-translational endoproteolytic cleavage of the pro-αv(14Lehmann M. Rigot V.

The cleavage at the highly conserved pairs of basic amino acids is known to be a function of furin-like proprotein convertases from the subtilisin/kexin family. This cleavage converts a single α-chain precursor into the mature subunit consisting of an N-terminal heavy α-chain and a C-terminal light α-chain connected by a disulfide bridge (16Lissitzky J.C.

In another report, 2Ratnikov, B. I., Rozanov, D. V., Postnova, T. I., Baciu, P. G., Zhang, H., DiScipio, R. G., Chestukhina, G. G., Smith, J. W., Deryugina, E. I., and Strongin, A. Y. (2002)J. Biol. Chem. 277,7377–7385. we presented evidence that MT1-MMP is capable of processing the precursor of the αv integrin subunit (pro-αv), thereby functioning as an integrin convertase. Thus, in breast carcinoma MCF7 cells co-expressing αvβ3integrin and MT1-MMP, the protease specifically cleaves pro-αv, generating a 115-kDa heavy α-chain with the truncated C terminus and a 25-kDa light α-chain commencing from the N-terminal Leu892. Consistent with these observations, our earlier findings (20Deryugina E.I. Bourdon M.A. Jungwirth K. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 21Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B. Monosov E. Postnova T.I. DiScipio R. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the cells co-expressing MT1-MMP and αvβ3 integrin were significantly more migratory relative to the cells transfected with MT1-MMP or αvβ3 integrin alone. This prompted us to investigate the migratory characteristics of transfected cells in detail. Here we report that processing of pro-αv by MT1-MMP facilitated αvβ3 integrin-mediated adhesion and especially migration of cells on vitronectin, the extracellular matrix ligand of αvβ3integrin. MT1-MMP cleavage of pro-αv did not affect RGD-ligand binding of αvβ3 integrin. However, the cells exhibiting both αvβ3integrin and MT1-MMP were more efficient in outside-in signal transduction through a focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway relative to the cells expressing αvβ3 integrin alone. Our data suggest that regulation of integrin functionality may be an important role of MT1-MMP in migrating tumor cells. Rabbit antibodies AB815 specific to a hinge region of MT1-MMP and αvβ3integrin-specific mAb LM609 were from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Fab-9 was purified as described (39Smith J.W. Hu D.

Vitronectin purified from human plasma was a kind gift of Richard DiScipio (La Jolla Institute for Molecular Medicine, La Jolla, CA). MCF7 cells mock-transfected and co-expressing αvβ3 integrin with the wild type MT-MMP (MT1-MMP-WT) or the catalytically inactive MT1-MMP-E240A mutant in which the Ala residue replaced the catalytically essential Glu-240 of the active site were described previously (41Rozanov D.V.

Routinely, transfected cell lines were maintained in DMEM/FCS supplemented with G418, Zeocin, or both antibiotics (each at 0.2 mg/ml). Cells were plated in DMEM/FCS supplemented with the indicated concentrations of a hydroxamate inhibitor AG3340. After preincubation with the inhibitor for 12–72 h, cells were washed with DPBS and surface-biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Following incubation for 60 min, cells were washed with ice-cold DPBS and lysed with 50 mm N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Amresco, Solon, OH) in TBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture containing 1 mm PMSF and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin. The lysates were precleared with Pansorbin (Calbiochem). The samples of cell lysates each containing 1.0 mg of protein were mixed with 2–3 μg of anti-integrin or anti-MT1-MMP antibodies and protein G-agarose beads. Following incubation for 14 h at 4 °C, agarose beads were washed with TBS containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm PMSF and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin), then with DPBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 (DPBS/Tween 20) and 0.5 mNaCl, and next with DPBS/Tween 20. Immune complexes were released by boiling the beads for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer (20 μl). After centrifugation, solubilized proteins were reduced and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Following blocking with 1% casein in DPBS/Tween 20, the membrane was probed with ExtrAvidin-HRP (Sigma), and the bound HRP activity was visualized with the TMB/M substrate (Chemicon). Cells were plated for 48 h in DMEM/FCS with or without dec-RVKR-cmk (100 μm), a furin inhibitor. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h with or without the inhibitor, detached with minimum trypsinization, extensively washed with ice-cold 1% BSA/DMEM, and resuspended in the prewarmed 1% BSA/DMEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Tissue culture dishes (150 mm in diameter) were coated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated concentrations of vitronectin and then washed with PBS and blocked with 1% BSA. Cells were allowed to adhere for 1 h to vitronectin-coated surfaces. Adherent cells were washed with ice-cold DPBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 and lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in TBS containing 1.0 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and inhibitor mixture (1 mm PMSF and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin). After incubation for 1 h on ice, cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The samples of cell lysates each containing 1.0 mg of protein were mixed with anti-FAK rabbit antibodies sc-557 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and protein G-agarose. Following incubation for 14 h at 4 °C, agarose beads were washed with TBS containing 1.0 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and inhibitor mixture (1 mm PMSF and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin), then with TBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.5m NaCl, and next with TBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20. Immune complexes were released by boiling the beads for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer (20 μl). After centrifugation, solubilized proteins were reduced and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to a membrane. After blocking with 1% BSA, the membrane was incubated with 2 μg/ml anti-FAK rabbit sc-557 antibodies or anti-phosphotyrosine murine mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and the TMB/M substrate. To estimate the phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) content in the immunoprecipitated FAK samples, the intensity of the Tyr(P) and FAK bands was quantified using an AlphaEase camera and AlphaImager software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Fab-9 binding was performed as reported previously (43Lin E.C. Ratnikov B.I. Tsai P.M. Carron C.P. Myers D.M. Barbas III, C.F. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23912-23920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells (3 × 106/ml) were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-Fab-9 at 14 °C for 70 min. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 5 mmEDTA. Following incubation, free 125I-Fab-9 was separated from cell-bound ligand by centrifugation through a layer of 20% sucrose in TBS at 14,000 rpm for 3 min. The radioactivity in pellets was determined in a gamma counter. The K D values of the αvβ3·Fab-9 complex were calculated by Scatchard analysis and by fitting the data with a single binding site curve using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Cell adhesion was performed in the wells of a high binding 96-well plate (Corning Glass) precoated overnight at 4 °C with vitronectin or Fab-9 at the indicated concentrations. Plates were blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with 1% BSA/DMEM supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Cells were incubated overnight in DMEM/FCS, detached with enzyme-free buffer (Specialty Media, Lavalette, NJ), washed, and resuspended in with 1% BSA/DMEM supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Cells were plated at 5 × 104, 0.1 ml in 1% BSA/DMEM supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and allowed to attach for 1 h at 37 °C. Where indicated, the increasing concentrations of cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Val) peptide (cRGD; Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) were used to inhibit cell adhesion. Adherent cells were fixed and stained with Crystal Violet, and the incorporated dye was extracted and quantified (21Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B. Monosov E. Postnova T.I. DiScipio R. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The directional migration of cells in Transwells (Costar, Cambridge, MA) was analyzed under serum-free conditions as described (21Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B. Monosov E. Postnova T.I. DiScipio R. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The undersurface of a 6.5-mm insert membrane with an 8-μm pore size was coated at 4 °C overnight with 2 μg/ml vitronectin and blocked with 1% BSA. Cells cultured overnight in DMEM/FCS were detached with enzyme-free buffer. Cells (7.5 × 104) were plated in 0.15 ml AIM-V medium (Invitrogen) per insert. The outer chamber was filled with 0.6 ml of AIM-V medium. Following incubation for 48 h, cells that migrated to the undersurface of the membrane were detached with trypsin/EDTA and counted. Where indicated, cells were first incubated in the presence of 10 μm AG3340 and/or 100 μm furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-cmk for 24–72 h and then plated into Transwells with the same inhibitor(s) added to both outer and inner chambers. In another study,2 we reported the novel mechanisms involving MT1-MMP in the limited proteolytic cleavage of pro-αv in MCF7 breast carcinoma cells. Our findings demonstrated that MT1-MMP functions as an integrin convertase. Similar to furin-like proprotein convertases, MT1-MMP converts a single chain pro-αv into the processed heavy and light α-chains connected by a disulfide bridge. To corroborate these findings and to confirm that the processing of pro-αv by MT1-MMP is not restricted to a single cell type, we examined the cell line of the glioma U251 cells that overexpressed MT1-MMP (42Deryugina E.I. Bourdon M.A. Reisfeld R.A. Strongin A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3743-3750PubMed Google Scholar). Empty vector construct served as control. To attenuate the effects of MT1-MMP on pro-αv, we inhibited the furin pathway of pro-αv maturation by incubating glioma and breast carcinoma cells with 100 μmdec-RVKR-cmk, a furin inhibitor (44Maquoi E. Noel A. Frankenne F. Angliker H. Murphy G. Foidart J.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 45Sato T. Kondo T. Fujisawa T. Seiki M. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37280-37284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous report (41Rozanov D.V. Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B.I. Monosov E.Z. Marchenko G.N. Quigley J.P. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25705-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), activation of MT1-MMP is not affected by inhibition of furin in breast carcinoma and glioma cells. Following incubation with the inhibitor for 48 h, cells were surface-biotinylated, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-αvβ3 mAb LM609. The inhibitor suppressed the furin-dependent cleavage of pro-αv and increased the relative levels of the 150-kDa pro-αv chain in control cells. Concomitantly, the levels of the 125-kDa mature heavy α-chain decreased in both control cell types, MCF7 and U251, co-incubated with the inhibitor (Fig.1). In contrast, the inhibitor had no significant effect on the processing of pro-αv in both breast carcinoma and glioma cells co-expressing αvβ3 integrin and MT1-MMP. In these cells the furin inhibitor failed to block pro-αv maturation. These findings extend our observations2 and suggest that the MT1-MMP-dependent pathway of pro-αvmaturation is likely to exist in many cancer cell types, thereby representing a general phenomenon. To study the functional implications of our findings, we analyzed whether the RGD ligand binding of αvβ3 integrin was affected in cells expressing MT1-MMP. For these purposes, the ligand binding ability of αvβ3 integrin expressed in β3/zeo, β3/MT-WT, and β3/MT-E240A cells was assessed using a recombinant Fab fragment, Fab-9, designed as an RGD-ligand highly specific for β3 integrins (39Smith J.W.

In another study,2we demonstrated that similar to anti-αvβ3 mAb LM609 the chimeric ligand efficiently precipitated MT1-MMP-processed species of αvβ3 integrin. To quantitatively confirm these observations further, we evaluated the ligand binding efficiency of 125I-labeled Fab-9 to αvβ3 integrin expressed in β3/zeo, β3/MT-WT, and β3/MT-E240A cells. Binding of αvβ3 integrin by Fab-9 was specific and cation-dependent, as addition of 5 mm EDTA completely abrogated Fab-9 binding (data not shown). SimilarK D values of the Fab-9·αvβ3 interactions were demonstrated for these cell types (Table I). There was no significant difference in the total number of Fab-9-binding sites/cell in β3/zeo, β3/MT-WT, and β3/MT-E240A cells.Table IComparison of the Fab-9 binding affinity of αvβ3integrin expressed in cellsCell lineK DBinding sites/cellnmβ3/zeo3.13 ± 0.41 (n = 2)1-an is the number of independent experiments performed in triplicate.70,900β3/MT-WT6.01 ± 0.76 (n = 3; p= 0.06)70,500β3/MT-E240A3.27 (n = 1)59,0001-a n is the number of independent experiments performed in triplicate.

To elaborate further on the effect of MT1-MMP on RGD ligand binding capacity of αvβ3 integrin, we examined the attachment of β3/zeo, β3/MT-WT, and β3/MT-E240A cells on plastic precoated with Fab-9 in the presence of increasing concentrations of the soluble cRGD peptide. Our observations indicate that the peptide was similarly efficient in inhibiting adhesion of all these cell lines to Fab-9 (Fig.2 B). Overall, these findings indicate that the MT1-MMP-mediated processing of integrin αv subunit does not significantly affect the RGD ligand binding characteristics of the resulting αvβ3 integrin. To evaluate the possible relevance of the MT1-MMP-αvβ3interactions on cell motility, we analyzed cell adhesion and migration on vitronectin, a natural ligand of αvβ3integrin. First, we assessed the ability of cells to adhere to increasing concentrations of vitronectin. Consistent with our earlier reports (21Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B. Monosov E. Postnova T.I. DiScipio R. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), our current studies indicated that in a short term assay, β3/MT-WT cells were more adhesive to vitronectin relative to β3/zeo or β3/MT-E240A cells (Fig.3 A). This difference in adhesion efficiency of the cells was especially pronounced at the relatively low concentrations of the ligand. However, all three cell lines were highly similar in their response to increasing concentrations of the cRGD peptide that competitively inhibited vitronectin-mediated attachment of cells (Fig. 3 B). According to these observations, co-expression of MT1-MMP and αvβ3 integrin promoted cell adhesion to vitronectin without affecting the RGD binding ability of the integrin. Furthermore, we assessed the migration efficiency of cells in Transwell chambers with the membrane undersurface precoated with vitronectin. As additional control, in these experiments we used neo/MT-WT cells that are deficient in αvβ3 integrin but express the wild type MT1-MMP. To determine the levels of MT1-MMP and αvβ3 integrin (Fig.4 A) expressed on cell surfaces, cells were surface-labeled with biotin. Following cell lysis, MT1-MMP and αvβ3 integrin were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation detected significant amounts of MT1-MMP in neo/MT-WT cells as well as in β3/MT-WT and β3/MT-E240A cells. The β3/zeo cells were MT1-MMP-negative (Fig. 4 A). MT1-MMP was self-degraded in both neo/MT-WT and β3/MT-WT cells and largely existed as the 42- and 39-kDa stable autolytic for"
https://openalex.org/W2005134188,"We have characterized the effects of the antimitotic drug paclitaxel (TaxolTM) on the Ca2+ signaling cascade of terminally differentiated mouse pancreatic acinar cells. Using single cell fluorescence techniques and whole-cell patch clamping to record cytosolic Ca2+ and plasma membrane Ca2+-dependent Cl−currents, we find that paclitaxel abolishes cytosolic Ca2+oscillations and in more than half of the cells it also induces a rapid, transient cytosolic Ca2+ response. This response is not affected by removal of extracellular Ca2+ indicating that paclitaxel releases Ca2+ from an intracellular Ca2+ store. Using saponin-permeabilized cells, we show that paclitaxel does not affect Ca2+ release from an inositol trisphosphate-sensitive store. Furthermore, up to 15 min after paclitaxel application, there is no significant effect on either microtubule organization or on endoplasmic reticulum organization. The data suggest a non-endoplasmic reticulum source for the intracellular Ca2+ response. Using the mitochondrial fluorescent dyes, JC-1 and Rhod-2, we show that paclitaxel evoked a rapid decline in the mitochondrial membrane potential and a loss of mitochondrial Ca2+. Cyclosporin A, a blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, blocked both the paclitaxel-induced loss of mitochondrial Ca2+ and the effect on Ca2+spikes. We conclude that paclitaxel exerts rapid effects on the cytosolic Ca2+ signal via the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. This work indicates that some of the more rapidly developing side effects of chemotherapy might be due to an action of antimitotic drugs on mitochondrial function and an interference with the Ca2+ signal cascade.

Antimitotic drugs are used extensively for the treatment of cancer. For example, paclitaxel (Taxol) is used in the treatment of breast and ovarian cancers and for AIDS 1AIDSaquired immunodeficiency syndromBP basal poleCl(Ca)calcium-dependent chloride currentERendoplasmic reticulumFCCPp-trifluoromethoxy carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazoneIP3inositol trisphosphatePTPpermeability transition poreSPsecretory polePBSphosphate-buffered salinePipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidIns(14,5,)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateIns(24,5)P3, inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate -related Kaposi's sarcoma, and vinblastine is used in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease (1Rowinsky E.K. Semin. Oncol. 1997; 24: S19.1-S19–12Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of antimitotic drugs, that leads to cancer cell death, is not clear. It is known that paclitaxel stabilizes microtubule dynamics thereby preventing the proper formation of the mitotic spindle apparatus and arresting cancer cells at the G2-M phase of the cell cycle (2Jordan M.A. Toso R.J. Thrower D. Wilson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9552-9556Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 3Yvon A.M. Wadsworth P. Jordan M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 947-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). While it is thought that this action of paclitaxel on the cell cycle machinery precedes an apoptotic response of cells (4Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 5Haldar S. Basu A. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1977; 57: 229-233Google Scholar), some recent work has suggested that paclitaxel-induced apoptosis results from more direct effects of the drug on the mitochondria. In this context paclitaxel has been shown to bind to Bcl-2 (6Rodi D.J. Janes R.W. Sanganee H.J. Holton R.A. Wallace B.A. Makowski L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and this binding may regulate Bcl-2 effects on the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) (7Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar, 8Shimizu S. Matsuoka Y. Sinohara Y. Yondea Y. Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of the loop region of Bcl-2 (which prevents Bcl-2 phosphorylation) blocks the apoptotic action of paclitaxel on cancer cells (9Srivatava R.K., Mi Q-S. Hardwick J.M. Longo D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3775-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Other proteins may also be involved in the paclitaxel effects on mitochondria, such as APAF-1 (10Perkins C.L. Fang G. Kim C.N. Bhalla K.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1645-1653PubMed Google Scholar). In isolated mitochondria paclitaxel acts to release cytochrome c (11Andre N. Braguer D. Brasseur G. Goncalves A. Lemesle-Meunier D. Guise S. Jordan M.A. Briand C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5349-5353PubMed Google Scholar).

However, the actions of these drugs on Bcl-2 and on the mitochondria might be expected to be non-selective and affect all cells. Indeed paclitaxel treatment is associated with serious side effects, including neuropathy (12Postma T.J. Vermorken J.B. Liefting A.J. Pinedo H.M. Heimans J.J. Ann. Oncol. 1995; 6: 489-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and low white blood cell counts (13Tong A.W. Seamour B. Lawson J.M. Ordonez G. Vukelja S. Hyman W. Richards D. Stein L. Maples P.B. Nemunaitis J. Am. J. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 23: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These side effects occur rapidly, appear to be due to drug action on terminally differentiated cells, and are slowly reversible. Thus it is unlikely that these side effects are mediated by either mitotic block or apoptosis. Given that the clinical use of antimitotic drugs is limited by these side effects, understanding the mechanisms by which these drugs act is an important step toward optimizing the therapeutic benefits. In our studies, on terminally differentiated epithelial cells, we now show rapid actions of paclitaxel on the cytosolic Ca2+signal that can be accounted for by effects of paclitaxel on the PTP of the mitochondria. Given the universality of Ca2+ signaling, it is likely that this action of paclitaxel accounts for some of the side effects of antimitotic drugs. Male outbred albino mice (25 g) were killed by cervical dislocation and the pancreas dissected. Mouse pancreatic acinar cells were prepared by collagenase (Worthington, CLSPA, Lorne Labs.) digestion at 33 °C for 7 min as previously described (14Thorn P. Petersen O.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 66: 185-200Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto poly-l-ornithine (Sigma, United Kingdom)-coated dishes and were used within 3 h of isolation from the animal. Standard whole cell patch clamp techniques (15Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar) were employed and all experiments were carried out at room temperature (∼21 °C). Pipettes had a resistance of 3–6 MΩ (pipette puller, Brown and Flaming). After breaking through to the whole cell configuration pipettes had a measured, but uncompensated, series resistance of 10–20 MΩ. The pipette solution contained (mm): 140 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 Na2ATP, 0.01 EGTA, (0.05 calcium green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), 10 HEPES KOH, pH 7.2. The extracellular solution contained (mm) NaCl 135, KCl 5, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1, glucose 10, NaOH-HEPES 10, pH 7.4. In the Ca2+-free solution, used in the experiments of Fig. 2, no Ca2+ was added. Cells were held at a membrane potential of −30 mV and currents were sampled by an A/D converter (EPC-9, HEKA) at 2 KHz. In most experiments Ins(2,4,5)P3 (gift from Professor R. Irvine, Cambridge, UK) was added to the pipette solution (10 μm) to establish trains of Ca2+ spikes. These spikes have previously been shown to result from InsP3-dependent Ca2+ release in the secretory pole (16Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Ca2+ imaging experiments were performed as previously described (17Kidd J.F. Fogarty K.E. Tuft R.A. Thorn P. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, inclusion of 40–50 μm Calcium Green in the pipette solution allowed imaging of the cytosolic Ca2+ signal. Cells were illuminated at 488 nm (Coherent Innova 70) and imaged through a Nikon ×40 UV, 1.3NA, oil immersion objective through a 510-nm long pass filter. Full frame images (128 × 128 pixels) were captured on a cooled CCD camera (70% quantum efficiency, 5 electrons readout noise; MIT, Lincoln Laboratories) with a pixel size of 200 nm at the specimen and at rates of up to 500 Hz. After recording to computer, the data were analyzed with custom software with bleach correction routines and appropriate smoothing. Images were displayed as ΔF/F o images (100 × (F − F o )/F o ), where F is the recorded fluorescence andF o was obtained from the mean of 20 sequential frames where no activity was apparent. Cells were loaded with actetoxymethyl esters of various fluorescent probes (Molecular Probes) and the fluorescent signal measured from single cells with a Cairn Dual Emission Fluoresence System (Cairn Research, Faversham, UK). Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ m ) was carried out using the dye JC-1 loaded at a concentration of 1 μm for 20 min at room temperature (22 °C). The dye was excited at a wavelength of 488 nm and the emitted light collected at 590 and 530 nm. The ratio of red (590 nm) to green (530 nm) gives an index of the mitochondrial membrane potential: the higher the mitochondrial potential the greater proportion of JC-1 aggregates in the mitochondria, the greater the intensity of the red light signal and so with active mitochondria we see a relatively high ratio of 590/530 nm (18Reers M. Smith T.W. Chen L.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4480-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). To measure mitochondrial Ca2+ signals we used Rhod-2AM at a concentration of 10 μm loaded at 37 °C for 40 min. This protocol specifically loaded the dye into the mitochondria as judged by the overlapping fluorescent signal from the mitochondrial dye Mitofluor (Fig. 6). In these experiments data are presented as F/F o , where F is the recorded fluorescence and F o was measured before drug application. In our experiments we used 10–20 μm paclitaxel applied to the bathing solution of the cells. To estimate the intracellular concentration reached over a period of 10 min we used Oregon Green-conjugated paclitaxel (Molecular Probes) and imaged intracellular fluorescence using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. The intracellular fluorescence was measured over time within an 8-μm spot centered on the cell with an optical section of 1 μm. A calibration curve was made using a range of Oregon Green paclitaxel concentrations and recording the fluorescence signal as above. For two independent experiments we obtained a value of 322.5 nm as the peak intracellular concentration reached over 10 min. This value represents an upper limit for the cytosolic concentration of the drug, as it would be expected to bind to microtubules. Hepatocytes were isolated from livers of male Wistar rats and then permeabilized by incubation with saponin (10 μg/ml) in cytosol-like medium containing 140 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm Pipes (pH 7 at 37 °C). The cells were washed and resuspended (10 million cells/ml) in cytosol-like medium supplemented with CaCl2(free [Ca2+] ∼ 200 nm), ATP (7.5 mm), carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP, 10 μm), and 45Ca2+ (7.5 μCi/ml) (19Correa V. Riley A.M. Shuto S. Horne G. Nerou E.P. Marwood R.D. Potter B.V.L. Taylor C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1206-1215Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). FCCP was used in these experiments to exclude Ca2+flux from mitochondria. After 5 min at 37 °C, during which the intracellular stores loaded to steady-state with45Ca2+, thapsigargin (1.25 μm) was added to inhibit further Ca2+ uptake together with paclitaxel (20 μm) or its solvent (Me2SO) and either a maximal (5 μm) or submaximal (100 nm) concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3. After a further 5 min, the incubations were terminated by rapid filtration and the 45Ca2+ contents of the stores determined. After correction for the 45Ca2+ nonspecifically bound to the cells (determined by addition of 10 μmionomycin), the 45Ca2+ contents of the stores were expressed as percentages of the control45Ca2+ content. Cells were washed quickly in PBS (including calcium and magnesium) and then in K-Pipes buffer (K-Pipes 80 mm, EGTA 5 mm, MgCl2 2 mm, pH 6.5). Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehdye in K-Pipes buffer for 30 min and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After a 1-h block in 2% donkey serum plus 2% fish skin gelatin in PBS, cells were incubated in primary antibody (β-tubulin mouse monoclonal, clone TUB 2.1, Sigma, UK) for 1 h. After washing, a secondary antibody (donkey anti-mouse Fab fragment, Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) conjugated to a fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorphore was applied for 30 min. The images of Fig. 6were obtained with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope with a ×63 planacromat oil immersion lens and excitation light provided by an argon and a HeNe laser. The emitted light collected at the indicated wavelengths. Confocal sections (1 μm in depth) were obtained in the mid-section of the cells and image overlays were produced with proprietary Zeiss software. We have previously used the whole cell patch clamp method to record the activation of Ca2+-dependent chloride currents (Cl(Ca)) in single mouse pancreatic acinar cells (16Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The Cl(Ca) current is commonly used as an indirect measure of cytosolic Ca2+ and is a particularly good index of the small subplasmalemal Ca2+ signals that occur in the apical pole of polarized epithelia (17Kidd J.F. Fogarty K.E. Tuft R.A. Thorn P. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the typical effects of paclitaxel on the whole cell Cl(Ca), currents in a single pancreatic acinar cell. In a cell stimulated with Ins(2,4,5)P3 to produce trains of Ca2+ spikes (16Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), paclitaxel induced a rapid increase in the Cl(Ca) current followed by an abolition of the spike response (n = 14/26, Fig.1 A). In the other 12 cells paclitaxel led to a gradual loss of the Cl(Ca) current spikes (Fig. 1 B). Applied alone paclitaxel had no effect (n = 3 cells, Fig.1 C) and Me2SO, the solvent in which paclitaxel was dissolved, at 1% (v/v) (a ×5–10 greater concentration than that used in the paclitaxel experiments) had no significant effect on the current spikes (Fig. 1 D). These data indicate that paclitaxel can, in many cells, promote a rapid activation of the Cl(Ca) current. Since the Cl(Ca) channels are primarily under the control of cytosolic Ca2+ (20Kidd J.F. Thorn P. Pflugers Arch. 2001; 441: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) this suggests that paclitaxel elicits a Ca2+ signal. To test this directly we carried out Ca2+ imaging experiments using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye Calcium Green introduced into the cell cytosol via infusion through the solution of the patch pipette (21Fogarty K.E. Kidd J.F. Tuft R.A. Thorn P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2298-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We further probed the possible source of the Ca2+ signal induced by paclitaxel by removing extracellular Ca2+ in these experiments. Fig.2 shows a typical response, the infusion of Ins(2,4,5)P3 resulting in the induction of small, short-lasting Ca2+ spikes in the apical region of the cell (indicated secretory pole, SP, in Fig. 2). Application of 10 μm paclitaxel induced a rapid Ca2+ response that spread from the apical region to all regions of the cell (n = 5/6 cells). In these experiments we were limited to capturing images over an 80-s period. However, a second series of images, captured later in the experiment, showed no evidence of a Ca2+ signal, indicating that the paclitaxel-evoked Ca2+ rise was transient and the local Ca2+spikes were abolished (data not shown). This is entirely consistent with the data shown in Fig. 1 A. Since there is no extracellular Ca2+ we conclude that the paclitaxel induced Ca2+ response must originate from an intracellular Ca2+ store. The major Ca2+ store in pancreatic acinar cells is in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where Ca2+ is released in an IP3-dependent manner (22Petersen O.H. Petersen C.C. Kasai H. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 297-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 23Lee M.G., Xu, X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15765-15770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To test if paclitaxel might be acting directly on IP3-dependent stores we utilized the permeabilized hepatocyte preparation where the Ca2+ stores were preloaded with 45Ca2+ and the loss of radiolabeled Ca2+ in response to Ins(1,4,5)P3was measured (19Correa V. Riley A.M. Shuto S. Horne G. Nerou E.P. Marwood R.D. Potter B.V.L. Taylor C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1206-1215Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The data in Table Ishow that a saturating concentration of 5 μmIns(1,4,5)P3 releases about 30% of the Ca2+from the store and that this response is unaffected by the presence of paclitaxel. At an intermediate concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3 (100 nm) about 20% of the store Ca2+ content is released and again paclitaxel has no significant effect on this. We conclude that the intracellular Ca2+ store affected by paclitaxel is not likely to be IP3-dependent. However, our data do not exclude the possibility that, while paclitaxel may not act directly on IP3-dependent release of Ca2+, it may act indirectly by physically changing the store morphology and this in turn may affect store behavior. In this context we have previously shown that microtubule depolymerizing agents have dramatic effects on Ca2+ signaling by locally and rapidly reorganizing the ER (24Fogarty K.E. Kidd J.F. Turner A. Skepper J.N. Carmichael J. Thorn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22487-22494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We therefore went on to study the possible effects of paclitaxel on microtubular and ER organization.Table IIP 3 -dependent Ca2+ release is unaffected by paclitaxelControlPaclitaxel100107 ± 4100 nm IP383 ± 181 ± 370 ± 372 ± 445Ca2+ was preloaded into the Ca2+ stores of permeabilized hepatocytes. The figures show the 45Ca2+remaining after the various conditions, expressed as % of the total content. 5 μm Ins(1,4,5)P3 is a saturating concentration and the entire Ins(1,4,5)P3-dependent Ca2+ store is emptied (19Correa V.

In our experiments this represents about 30% of the total loaded 45Ca2+. With 100 nm Ins(1,4,5)P3 about 20% of the total store is emptied. In all conditions paclitaxel had no significant effect on Ins(1,4,5)P3-dependent release.

Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. To measure any effects of paclitaxel on microtubule and ER organization we carried out experiments to immunolocalize β-tubulin and to image the fluorescent probe, ER tracker, respectively. Standard microtubule-preserving techniques were used to fix the acinar cells (K-Pipes buffer) and we probed with a monoclonal antibody against β-tubulin. We then imaged clusters of acinar cells taking confocal sections through the cluster of cells at various depths. For clarity, Fig. 3 shows confocal sections only through the lower, middle, and the upper parts of the cell clusters. In the phase images shown the apical domain is seen in the central part of the cell clusters and is delineated by the presence of the phase-dark secretory granules. In control cells an extensive network of microtubules was observed with predominance in the apical domain, the region presumed to contain the microtubule organizing centers (25Kraemer J. Schmitz F. Drenckhahn D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Application of paclitaxel (20 μm) did not dramatically alter this pattern of staining although the impression was that after 5 min treatment there was a structural reorganization that led to a criss-cross pattern of microtubules in the basal pole (two independent preparations). To test if this possible rearrangement of the microtubular system has any effect on the ER distribution we used ER tracker that has the key advantage of allowing visualization of the ER in single live cells. Fig. 4 shows a typical experiment with the ER tracker fluorescence excluded from the granular region of the secretory pole and from the nucleus. This distribution of fluorescence is consistent with the distribution of the ER as visualized with immunolocalization of the ER-resident protein calreticulin (24Fogarty K.E. Kidd J.F. Turner A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27764-27770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To determine any changes in the ER distribution we recorded the average fluorescent signal in a 5-μm diameter region in the apical (secretory pole) and divided this by the average signal in a 5-μm diameter region in the basal pole. The ratio of secretory pole to basal pole fluorescence (SP/BP fluorescence ratio) did not change in control cells (circles, n = 7 independent cells) and did not change in the presence of 10 μm paclitaxel (triangles, n = 10 independent cells). We conclude that paclitaxel does promote changes in the microtubular system but, at least over this time frame, there is no reorganization of the ER. These observations are consistent with early observations, in other cell types, of paclitaxel effects on microtubules and ER organization (27Lee C. Ferguson M. Chen L.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2045-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Figure 4Paclitaxel does not affect the distribution of the endoplasmic reticulum. A, cells were loaded with ER tracker, a fluorescent probe that inserts into intracellular membranes. The fluorescent signal observed shows a widespread distribution across the cell with exclusion from the nucleus and secretory granules. B, after paclitaxel treatment no change in the pattern of fluorescence was observed. C, the signal was quantified by measuring the average fluorescence in a 5-μm diameter region in the secretory pole (SP) and ratioing this to a 5-μm diameter region in the basal pole. Individual points on the graph were obtained from 7 cells (control, circles) and 10 cells (paclitaxel, triangles) with a minimum of 3 cells for any data point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Another intracellular Ca2+ store, significant in many cell types, is the mitochondria. In pancreatic acinar cells mitochondria have been shown to contain low levels of Ca2+ at rest, but to rapidly take up Ca2+ during IP3-evoked Ca2+ responses (28Park M.K. Ashby M.C. Erdemlil G. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). If paclitaxel acted to release Ca2+ from mitochondria this would be consistent with the cytosolic Ca2+ responses we observed. We therefore set out to determine possible effects of paclitaxel on mitochondria. If paclitaxel were stimulating a route of Ca2+ exit from the mitochondria there are three known mechanisms where it might act. These are: (a) the PTP; (b) Na+-dependent efflux; (c) Na+-independent efflux (29Rizzuto R. Bernardi P. Pozzan T. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Ca2+ efflux through any of these pathways would be expected to affect the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ m ). To record this we utilized the potential-sensitive probe JC-l. We observed a rapid decrease in the ratio of emitted light collected at 590 and 530 nm on addition of the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP (1 μm, Fig.5 A) that represents a drop in Δψ m . In separate experiments, 10 μmpaclitaxel (n = 8/11 cells, Fig. 5 B) induced a decrease in Δψ m . To determine if these effects of paclitaxel on the Δψ m might be associated with a loss of mitochondrial Ca2+ we carried out experiments to directly measure mitochondrial responses. We used Rhod-2/AM, a Ca2+-sensitive dye that can be specifically loaded into the mitochondria. To verify that our dye loading protocol led to a specific loading of the mitochondria we carried out control experiments where we also loaded the cells with Mitofluor Green/AM, a mitochondrial specific dye (30Boitier E. Rea R. Duchen M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The excitation/emission wavelengths of these dyes are widely separated and we ensured, using experiments with only a single dye, that there was no “bleed” from one fluorescence channel to the other. We then took confocal images of Rhod-2 and Mitofluor Green fluorescence in the same cell. The results indicated that Rhod-2 and Mitofluor Green were loaded into the same cellular compartment with a characteristic distribution (Fig. 6) similar to that previously described for mitochondria in these cells (31Tinel H. Cancela J.M. Mogami H. Gerasimenko J.V. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4999-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This result indicates that the Rhod-2 signal we record from single cells is predominantly from the mitochondria. First we measured the Rhod-2 response following stimulation of the cells with the agonist acetylcholine. In 3/4 cells, 100 nmacetylcholine induced an increase in the mitochondrial Ca2+as measured by an increase in the Rhod-2 fluorescence (Fig.7 A). Subsequent addition of 10 μm paclitaxel induced a drop in mitochondrial Ca2+ (n = 4/4 cells) and a further decline was seen with the addition of 1 μm FCCP (n = 3/3 cells).

The composition of this high molecular mass protein-mineral complex consists of about 18% mineral, 80% fetuin, and 2% matrix Gla protein (MGP) by weight, and the presence of the complex in serum after an injection of 8 mg etidronate/100 g of body weight elevates calcium by 1.8-fold (to 4.3 mm), phosphate by 1.6-fold (to 5.6 mm), and MGP by 25-fold (to 12 μg/ml). The serum mineral complex reaches maximal levels at 6 h after subcutaneous injection of etidronate and is subsequently cleared from serum by 24 h. This highly specific complex of fetuin, MGP, and mineral prevents the growth, aggregation, and precipitation of the mineral component, which indicates that the previously reported calcification inhibitory activities of fetuin and MGP may be related to their ability to form stable complexes with nascent mineral nuclei. Treatment with the vitamin K-antagonist warfarin prevents the increase in serum MGP after etidronate injection, which shows that the increase in serum MGP is due to new synthesis and that the γ-carboxylation of MGP is necessary for its binding to the serum mineral complex.

Recent genetic and biochemical studies have established MGP as the first protein known to act as a calcification inhibitor in vivo. In humans, defects in the MGP gene that predict a non-functional MGP protein have been shown to be responsible for Keutel syndrome (1Munroe P.B. Olgunturk R.O. Fryns J.P. Maldergem L.V. Ziereisen F.

In mice, targeted deletion of the MGP gene causes rapid calcification of the elastic lamellae of the arterial media, which begins at birth and is sufficiently extensive by 3–6 weeks of age that the arteries become rigid tubes that fracture, causing death by exsanguination in most of the affected mice by 6 weeks of age (4Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). MGP-deficient mice also display abnormal calcification of growth plate and tracheal ring cartilage. Finally, treatment of rats with the vitamin K antagonist warfarin at doses that inhibit the γ-carboxylation of MGP causes rapid calcification of elastic lamellae of arteries and of aortic heart valves and increased expression of MGP mRNA in the calcifying artery (5Price P.A.

Matrix Gla protein is a 10-kDa secreted protein that was originally discovered in demineralization extracts of bone but is now known to be expressed by a wide variety of tissues and cell types. The rat tissues with the highest levels of MGP mRNA are cartilage, heart, kidney, and lung (7Fraser J.D. Price P.A. J. Biol.

Although several noncalcified tissues do express MGP mRNA at a higher level than bone, significant levels of the protein itself have only been found in bone and calcified cartilage (8Hale J.E.

Res. 1994; 9: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the protein may accumulate at sites of calcification and that much of the protein secreted by noncalcified tissues probably escapes to plasma, where MGP is found at 0.3–1 μg/ml depending on the species. MGP contains five residues of the vitamin K-dependent calcium binding amino acid, γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) (14Price P.A. Urist M.R. Otawara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Rice J.S. Williamson M.K. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Specific proteolytic cleavage at a conserved dibasic site in the C-terminal region has also been observed for MGP isolated from human, bovine, and shark tissues (13Rice J.S. Williamson M.K.

The original objective of the present study was to use the geminal bisphosphonate etidronate (ethylhydroxybisphosphonate) to probe the function of MGP in bone metabolism. These studies were prompted by the fact that etidronate and MGP both bind strongly to bone mineral and by previous studies that showed that etidronate competes with bone Gla protein (BGP; osteocalcin), a related vitamin K-dependent protein, for binding to hydroxyapatite in vitro, and that etidronate injection into a rat produced a transient 3-fold elevation in serum BGP levels (18Price P.A. Williamson M.K. Baukol S.A. Veis A. The Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Connective Tissues.1. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1981: 327-335Google Scholar). We report here that etidronate produced a greater than 25-fold elevation in serum levels of MGP within 6 h and that this elevation is caused by the unexpected appearance of a novel complex of calcium, phosphate, fetuin, and MGP in serum after etidronate injection. The structure and properties of this complex have direct relevance to an understanding of how MGP normally inhibits calcification in vivo. Simonsen albino male rats (Sprague-Dawley-derived) were purchased from Simonsen labs (Gilroy, Ca). Etidronate was a gift from Proctor and Gamble (Cincinnati, OH). Sephacryl S-300 HR gel filtration media was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Ultrafree CL filtration devices were purchased from Millipore Corp. Warfarin was purchased from Sigma. Stock solutions of sodium warfarin were prepared at 50 mg/ml in 0.15m NaCl and stored in sterile foil-wrapped containers at 4 °C. MGP was purified from rat bone as described (17Hale J.E. Williamson M.K. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21145-21149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies against rat fetuin were prepared as described (19Mizuno m. Farach-Carson M.C. Pinero G.J. Fujisawa R. Brunn J.C. Seyer J.M. Bousfield G.R. Mark M.P. Butler W.T. Bone Miner. 1991; 13: 1-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All other reagents used were reagent grade or better. Rats were fed rodent diet 5001 (Purina Mills Inc., St. Louis, MO), a diet that is 0.67% phosphorus and 0.95% calcium by weight. Etidronate was dissolved with 0.15m NaCl, titrated to pH 7.4 with dilute NaOH, and administered subcutaneously to 40-day-old male rats. Control animals received injections of 0.15 m NaCl only. In the initial time course experiment (Fig. 1), 5 40-day-old male rats were injected with 8 mg of etidronate/100 g of body weight at t = 0. At the times indicated in Fig. 1, each rat was anesthetized with metofane, and a 400-μl sample of blood was withdrawn from the jugular vein. Blood samples were allowed to clot for 15 min at room temperature, and serum was obtained after centrifugation in a clinical centrifuge and then frozen rapidly on dry ice and stored at −70 °C until later analysis. The same procedure was followed for the second time course experiment (Fig. 2), with the difference that the etidronate dose was increased to 32 mg/100 g of body weight.Figure 2Effect of a 32-mg/100-g etidronate dose on serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and matrix Gla protein. Three forty-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were given subcutaneous injections of etidronate at a dose of 32 mg/100 g body weight att = 0. Blood was removed from each animal at the indicated times and analyzed to determine the levels of calcium, phosphate, and MGP (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each data point is the average of the individually determined levels in the three experimental animals. ▪, serum calcium, mm; ○, serum phosphate, mm; ▵, serum MGP, μg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the effect of warfarin on the generation of the serum protein-mineral complex, 4 rats received subcutaneous injections of 15.4 mg of warfarin/100 g of body weight, and 4 rats received injections of saline vehicle. Two hours later, all rats were injected with etidronate at a dose of 8 mg/100 g (t = 0), and 400 μl of blood were removed from each animal at the indicated times for biochemical analyses. Control experiments were also carried out in which four animals received warfarin but not etidronate and four animals were injected with saline vehicle only. In neither control group could we detect a significant change in serum levels of calcium, phosphate, or MGP at any time point. To examine the possible linkage between the generation of the serum mineral complex and inhibition of bone mineralization, 12 100-g rats were injected with 4 mg of etidronate at t = 0 and were then divided into 2 groups of 6 rats each. 0.5-ml blood samples were obtained from the group 1 rats at t = 0, 2, 6, and 12 h, and the rats were exsanguinated at t = 24 h. The group 2 rats were injected with a second dose of etidronate at t = 24 h, and 0.5-ml blood samples were obtained at t = 24, 26, 30, and 36 h. These rats were exsanguinated at t = 48 h. Serum was obtained at each time point and stored at −20 °C until later analysis. Tibias from the rats killed at 48 h as well as from age-matched controls were removed, cleaned of adhering tissue, and fixed in 70% ethanol. Tibia samples were embedded in plastic and cut into sections of 500 μm by Pathology Associates International (Frederick, MD). The resulting sections were microradiographed using a Hewlett-Packard model 4380N Faxitron x-ray machine. All animal experiments were approved by the University of California at San Diego animal subjects committee. The serum mineral complex was characterized by filtration using Ultrafree CL filtration devices with a 300-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane. In a typical experiment, blood was obtained from 2 control rats and from 2 rats 6 h after a dose of 8 mg of etidronate/100 g of body weight, and each blood sample was immediately placed into a 2.5-ml gold top Vacutainer tube (SST gel and clot activator tube, Becton Dickinson). Thirty minutes later 1-ml aliquots of the serum were removed, placed into the filtration device, and centrifuged for 80 min at 2500 ×g to force the sample through the membrane. The filtrate and retentate were then analyzed to determine calcium, phosphate, and volume. The typical filtrate volume recovered was 0.70 ml, and the typical retentate volume recovered was 0.26 ml. The effect of centrifugation on the serum mineral complex was investigated in serum samples obtained 6 h after administration of etidronate at doses of 8 mg/100 g and 32 mg/100 g of body weight. At the lower dose, no significant amount of calcium, phosphate, or MGP was sedimented after centrifugation for 30 min at 16,000 ×g. At the higher dose, a well defined translucent pellet was obtained after centrifugation for 30 min at 16,000 ×g. This pellet was dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mmHCl and analyzed for calcium, phosphate, and MGP. The serum mineral complex was characterized by gel filtration using 25-ml columns of Sephacryl S-300 HR that were prepared in disposable plastic pipettes and were equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2at room temperature. Serum was obtained from rats 6 h after administration of etidronate at a dose of 8 mg/100 g, and 1-ml aliquots were immediately applied to the Sephacryl column. Fractions of 0.5 ml were then collected and analyzed to determine the level of phosphate and MGP. For determination of MGP and BGP, aliquots of fractions and serum samples were diluted into diluent and assayed in triplicate using radioimmunoassay procedures previously described (12Cancela M.L. Price P.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Rice J.S. Williamson M.K. Price P.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Calcium levels in serum and other samples were determined colorimetrically using cresolphthalein complexone (Sigma), and phosphate levels in serum, effluent fractions, and other samples were determined colorimetrically as described (20Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5837) Google Scholar). For determination of ionic calcium, freshly obtained blood samples were immediately placed into a 2.5-ml gold top Vacutainer tube to avoid out-gassing of CO2 and the associated shift in pH. Clotted blood was centrifuged for 10 min in a clinical centrifuge, and serum was analyzed for ionic calcium at the University of California, San Diego Medical Center Chemistry Laboratory. Electrophoresis was carried out using 4–20% polyacrylamide gels (Novex, Inc., San Diego, CA) run in Tris-glycine buffer containing SDS. In the Western blot experiment shown in Fig. 4B, 100 μl of etidronate serum obtained as described in Table II was centrifuged at 16,000 × gfor 30 min at room temperature. The supernatant was then removed, and the pellet was dissolved with 100 μl of SDS loading buffer containing 60 mm EDTA. Dilutions were made with the same SDS/EDTA loading buffer so that the 20 μl loaded onto the gel contained 0.1 μl of serum from a control rat, 0.1 μl of serum from the etidronate-treated rat before centrifugation, or 0.1 μl of the supernatant or dissolved pellet obtained after centrifugation. After electrophoresis on a 4–20% polyacrylamide gel, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, incubated overnight with rabbit antibody against rat fetuin (1:500 dilution in TBST), and detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibody (Sigma). Protein sequencing was carried out on bands transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a Procise 494 Sequencer (ABI division, PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA).Table IIEffect of centrifugation on serum calcium, phosphate, and matrix Gla proteinCalciumPhosphateMGPμmolμmolngInitial serum9.647.4916,200Supernatant6.885.84800Dissolved pellet3.271.6814,400Serum was obtained from 3 40-day-old male rats 6 h after subcutaneous injection with etidronate at a dose of 32 mg/100 gm of body weight and was pooled.

The initial study was carried out to determine the effect of etidronate on serum MGP levels using a subcutaneous dose that, in a previous study, was found to elicit an elevation in serum levels of BGP (18Price P.A. Williamson M.K. Baukol S.A. Veis A. The Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Connective Tissues.1. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1981: 327-335Google Scholar), a vitamin K-dependent bone protein related in sequence to MGP. Serum was obtained from rats at different times after the subcutaneous administration of etidronate at a dose of 8 mg/100 g of body weight, and each serum sample was then analyzed for levels of MGP and BGP by radioimmunoassay. In agreement with the earlier study (18Price P.A. Williamson M.K. Baukol S.A. Veis A. The Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Connective Tissues.1. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1981: 327-335Google Scholar), serum levels of BGP were elevated by a maximum of 3-fold, and the peak serum BGP level was observed at 1 h (data not shown). In marked contrast, serum MGP levels were increased by 25-fold rather than 3-fold, and the peak level of MGP was observed at 6 h rather than at 1 h. Because MGP is known to inhibit the calcification of arteries and other soft tissues (5Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1400-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 6Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), we suspected that the dramatic serum MGP response to etidronate could be associated with the appearance of a calcium phosphate mineral complex in serum. We accordingly carried out a second experiment in which we measured serum levels of MGP, calcium, and phosphate at different times after the administration of etidronate. As shown in Fig. 1, serum calcium and phosphate levels increased rapidly after subcutaneous injection of etidronate, and by 6 h the levels of total calcium and phosphate were 76 and 59% above control levels, respectively. Serum levels of MGP increased more slowly than total serum calcium and phosphate levels, with half of the maximal levels at 3 h for MGP compared with 1 h for calcium and phosphate. To determine whether the rise in total calcium after etidronate administration is due to an increase in ionic calcium or to an increase in a calcium complex, in a follow up experiment 4 rats were exsanguinated at t = 0, 1, 2, and 6 h after injection of 8 mg of etidronate/100 g of body weight, and the level of ionic and total calcium were measured in each serum sample. Ionic calcium values were 1.46 ± 0.03 mm at t = 0 h, 1.47 ± 0.04 mm at 1 h, 1.51 ± 0.04 mm at 2 h, and 1.46 ± 0.03 mm at 6 h, whereas total calcium levels were 2.45 ± 0.11 mm att = 0 h, 3.45 ± 0.34 mm at 1 h, 4.05 ± 0.44 mm at 2 h, and 4.41 ± 0.43 mm at 6 h. The failure of etidronate to cause a rise in ionic calcium levels indicates that the increase observed in total calcium levels must be due to the appearance of a non-ionic form of calcium in serum. Because there is a parallel increase in serum phosphate and total calcium levels after etidronate injection (Fig. 1), it seemed likely that this non-ionic form of serum calcium is a complex of calcium and phosphate. As seen in Fig. 2, a 4-fold higher subcutaneous dose of etidronate produced a greater elevation in serum total calcium, phosphate, and MGP. The time course of the response to the 32-mg/100-g etidronate dose was similar to the response seen with the 8 mg/100 g dose over the first 9 h, with a maximal level in serum total calcium, phosphate, and MGP at 6–9 h after treatment with 32 mg/100 g etidronate. Serum levels of total calcium, phosphate, and MGP remained substantially elevated at 24 h after the 32 mg/100 g dose of etidronate, however, suggesting that the higher dose prolongs the serum response. Despite the 4.5-fold increase in serum total calcium at 6 h after treatment with 32 mg/100 g of etidronate, there was no increase in the level of serum-ionized calcium at 6 h, which further supports the conclusion that the increase in serum calcium is due to the appearance of a calcium complex. A 2-fold lower etidronate dose of 4 mg/100 g of body weight produced a smaller increase in serum calcium, phosphate, and MGP at 6 h than the 8 mg/100 g dose (data not shown). In contrast, the amino bisphosphonate alendronate had no effect on serum calcium, phosphate, and MGP levels measured at 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after administration of a 4 mg/100 g dose of the drug (data not shown). To further characterize the calcium complex that is responsible for the rise in total calcium but not ionic calcium after etidronate injection, serum from etidronate-treated and control rats was filtered through 300-kDa molecular mass cut off membranes using an Ultrafree CL filtration device, and the filtrate and retentate fractions were separately analyzed for calcium, phosphate, and MGP. As can be seen in Table I, the increase in total serum calcium, phosphate, and MGP levels produced by the 8 mg/100 g dose of etidronate proved to be due to an increase in the levels of calcium, phosphate, and MGP in the high molecular mass retentate fraction, and the filtrate levels of calcium and phosphate were the same for control and etidronate-treated rats. This result indicates that the increases in total calcium, phosphate, and MGP seen in the serum of rats treated with etidronate is probably due to the appearance of a high molecular mass serum complex of calcium, phosphate, and MGP.Table IEffect of filtration through a 300-kDa membrane on serum calcium, phosphate, and matrix Gla proteinCalciumPhosphateMGPControlEtidronateControlEtidronateControlEtidronateμmolμmolngInitial serum2.684.303.565.1045414,800Filtrate1.201.182.722.9842291Retentate1.282.720.981.8428411,630Serum was obtained from 2 40-day-old male rats 6 h after subcutaneous injection with etidronate at a dose of 8 mg/100 g of body weight and from 2 age-matched control rats. One-ml aliquots of the 4 serum samples were filtered through a 300-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane using a Ultrafree CL filtration device, and the levels of calcium, phosphate, MGP, and volume were measured for the filtrate and the retentate fractions (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The data show the number of μmol of calcium, phosphate, and MGP in 1 ml of serum before filtration and in the 0.7-ml filtrate and 0.26-ml retentate volumes recovered after filtration. The data are the average of the values for the two control rats and the two etidronate-treated rats. Open table in a new tab Serum was obtained from 2 40-day-old male rats 6 h after subcutaneous injection with etidronate at a dose of 8 mg/100 g of body weight and from 2 age-matched control rats. One-ml aliquots of the 4 serum samples were filtered through a 300-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane using a Ultrafree CL filtration device, and the levels of calcium, phosphate, MGP, and volume were measured for the filtrate and the retentate fractions (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The data show the number of μmol of calcium, phosphate, and MGP in 1 ml of serum before filtration and in the 0.7-ml filtrate and 0.26-ml retentate volumes recovered after filtration. The data are the average of the values for the two control rats and the two etidronate-treated rats. To determine the stability of the putative serum mineral complex, another 1-ml aliquot of serum from the etidronate-treated rats (see Table I legend) was placed into a sealed tube, incubated at room temperature for 1 day, and then filtered through a 300-kDa molecular mass cut off membrane using the method described in Table I. The levels of calcium, phosphate, and MGP in the resulting retentate and filtrate fractions were comparable with the values found for serum filtered immediately after serum was obtained (shown in Table I), with retentate calcium levels of 2.83 μmol, phosphate levels of 2.02 μmol, and MGP levels of 12,127 ng, and with filtrate calcium levels of 1.21 μmol, phosphate levels of 2.79 μmol, and MGP levels of 320 ng. This result shows that the putative calcium phosphate mineral phase found in the serum of an etidronate-treated rat does not grow at the expense of free calcium and phosphate levels in serum. In another stability test, a 1-ml aliquot of serum from the etidronate-treated rat was frozen on dry ice and thawed 5 times and then subjected to filtration. Retentate and filtrate levels of calcium, phosphate, and MGP levels were again comparable with the values shown in Table I, which demonstrates that the amount of the putative serum mineral complex is not affected by repetitive freezing of the serum sample. We next examined the possible sedimentation of the serum calcium phosphate complex during centrifugation, a property that might be anticipated for the complex based on the fact that calcium phosphate mineral phases typically have densities about 3-fold greater than serum. As shown in Table II, centrifugation of serum from rats treated with the 32-mg dose of etidronate resulted in a pellet containing calcium, phosphate, and MGP. When the pellet was dissolved in acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, a major band was found at 59 kDa that accounted for at least 80% of the Coomassie staining (Fig.3). When this component was electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride and subjected to N-terminal protein sequencing, one sequence was obtained, APQGAGLGFR, which matches the N-terminal sequence of rat fetuin (21Ohnishi T. Nakamura O. Ozawa M. Arakaki N. Muramatsu T. Daikuhara Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The other major band in the gel had an apparent molecular mass of 66 kDa and accounted for about 10% of the total Coomassie staining; this band was identified as rat serum albumin by N-terminal sequence analysis. Based on the recovery of fetuin in the pellet, we estimate the weight ratio of fetuin to mineral phosphate in the pellet to be 3.4 mg/mg. Western blot analyses, an example of which is shown in Fig.3B, revealed that formation of the protein mineral complex did not significantly increase the total levels of serum fetuin and that formation of the serum mineral complex consumed about half of the fetuin initially found in serum. Because it is conceivable that the nature of the protein mineral complex could be affected by the blood coagulation needed for serum collection, the filtration and centrifugation experiments described above were repeated using heparinized plasma samples. In the filtration experiment, filtrate and retentate levels of calcium, phosphate, and MGP in plasma from control rats and from the etidronate-treated rats were each within 5% of the valu"

Peptidoglycan (PGN), a cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, is known to elicit excessive proinflammatory cytokine production from immune cells. In this study we investigated whether SP-A interacts with PGN and alters PGN-elicited cellular responses. Binding studies demonstrate that PGN is not a ligand for SP-A. However, SP-A significantly reduced PGN-elicited tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) secretion by U937 cells and rat alveolar macrophages. The inhibitory effect on TNF-α secretion was dependent upon SP-A concentrations in physiological range. Coincubation of SP-A and PGN with human embryonic kidney 293 cells that had been transiently transfected with the cDNA of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), a cell signaling receptor for PGN, significantly attenuated PGN-induced nuclear factor-κB activity. SP-A directly bound to a soluble form of the recombinant extracellular TLR2 domain (sTLR2). Coincubation of sTLR2 with SP-A significantly reduced the binding of sTLR2 to PGN. These results indicate that the direct interaction of SP-A with TLR2 alters PGN-induced cell signaling. We propose that SP-A modulates inflammatory responses against the bacterial components by interactions with pattern-recognition receptors.

Animals lacking SP-A exhibit reduced bacterial clearance and elevated pulmonary inflammation in response to microbial challenge.Gram-positive bacteria including S. aureus cause infections that can be life-threatening. Peptidoglycan (PGN), a major cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, is a polymer of alternatingN-acetylglucosaminyl and N-acetylmuramyl glycan whose residues are cross-linked by short peptides (15Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PGN, like lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, can elicit the excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines from immune cells, which contribute to many of the adverse clinical manifestations of bacterial infections (16Gupta D. Jin Y. Dziarski R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2620-2630PubMed Google Scholar, 17Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 18Rosenthal R.S.

Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4379) Google Scholar) and participate in NF-κB signaling cascades elicited by LPS and PGN. In vivo studies with mice harboring null alleles for TLR2 provide strong evidence that TLR2 is responsible for PGN-induced signaling (22Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Recent in vitro studies with overexpression experiments also demonstrate that TLR2 confers cell responsiveness to PGN (24Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol.

Although CD14 alone appears incapable of signaling because it lacks a transmembrane domain, it is still capable of enhancing PGN-induced NF-κB signaling mediated by TLR2 (24Schwandner R. Dziarski R.

We have shown that the direct interaction of SP-A with CD14 is the likely mechanism for modulating LPS-elicited cellular responses (26Sano H. Sohma H. Muta T. Nomura S. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 387-395PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to SP-A, the collectins, SP-D, and MBP also bind CD14 (29Sano H. Chiba H. Iwaki D. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22442-22451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 30Chiba H. Sano H. Iwaki D. Murakami S. Mutsuzawa H. Takahashi T. Konishi M. Takahashi H. Kuroki Y. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), suggesting this may be an important property of this protein family. The interaction of SP-D with CD14 may be also accompanied by modulation of the cellular response to ligands such as LPS. SP-A-deficient mice exhibit significant increases in the production of TNF-α and nitric oxide after intratracheal instillation of smooth LPS when compared with wild type mice (31Borron P. McIntosh J.C. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Taylor J. Wright J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L840-L847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intratracheal administration of SP-A to SP-A-deficient mice diminished the production of the proinflammatory cytokines. Taken together with the in vitro observations of the inhibitory function of SP-A on smooth LPS-elicited TNF-α secretion (26Sano H. Sohma H. Muta T. Nomura S. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 387-395PubMed Google Scholar, 28McIntosh J.C. Mervin-Blake S. Conner E. Wright J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L310-L319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there is growing evidence that SP-A promotes an anti-inflammatory response to some bacterial ligands.The role of SP-A in modulating innate immunity may be a key element to understanding the dual requirement of the lung to remain relatively quiescent in its inflammatory response to routine daily burdens of inspired LPS and easily dispatched microorganisms while remaining competent to mount a potent and vigorous response to specialized pulmonary pathogens. Many inhaled pathogens that reach the alveolus are thought to interact immediately with lung collectins because these proteins are highly enriched at this biological interface.PGN elicits many of the clinical manifestations of Gram-positive organisms, and we focused on the interactions of SP-A with PGN and the consequences of the interaction upon TNF-α secretion by alveolar macrophages and U937 cells. The specific objectives of this study were to determine 1) the interaction of SP-A with PGN, 2) the role of SP-A in modulating leukocyte cytokine responses to PGN, 3) the interaction between SP-A and TLR2, and 4) the role of SP-A in altering PGN interaction with TLR2. Our findings demonstrate that PGN is not a ligand for SP-A and that SP-A reduces the PGN-elicited proinflammatory cytokine release by reducing TLR2-PGN interactions.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that SP-A inhibits PGN-induced TNF-α secretion by U937 cells and alveolar macrophages. In addition, SP-A attenuates PGN-elicited NF-κB activation in TLR2-transfected HEK293 cells. Direct binding studies also provide clear evidence that SP-A and PGN bind the extracellular TLR2 domain. Binding competition analysis demonstrates that SP-A can alter the interaction of TLR2 with PGN. Direct interaction of SP-A with TLR2 and down-regulation of TLR signaling by SP-A constitute the likely mechanisms by which SP-A inhibits PGN-induced cellular responses. This study supports an antiinflammatory role for SP-A in controlling the host response to PGN from S. aureus.Initial experiments performed in this study focused on interactions between SP-A and PGN. Solid phase binding did not reveal any interaction between SP-A and PGN. However, we were not able to quantify the amount of PGN bound to the wells. We therefore conducted binding assays in solution with sedimentable PGN. Consistent with the solid phase binding results, SP-A failed to bind to PGN in solution. Taken together, we conclude that PGN derived from S. aureus is not a ligand for SP-A.Previous studies from this (26Sano H. Sohma H. Muta T. Nomura S. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 387-395PubMed Google Scholar) and other (28McIntosh J.C. Mervin-Blake S. Conner E. Wright J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L310-L319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) laboratories demonstrate that SP-A inhibits smooth LPS-elicited TNF-α secretion by alveolar macrophages and U937 cells. SP-A has also been shown to down-regulate proinflammatory cytokine production elicited by Candida albicans (44Rosseau S. Hammerl P. Maus U. Günther A. Seeger W. Grimminger F. Lohmeyer J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4495-4502PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these studies, another study (45Kremlev S.G. Phelps D.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L712-L719PubMed Google Scholar) reports that SP-A stimulates the production of cytokines including TNF-α, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6. However, in vivostudies (31Borron P. McIntosh J.C. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Taylor J. Wright J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L840-L847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using SP-A (−/−) mice give results consistent with an inhibitory role of SP-A on inflammatory cytokine production. SP-A (−/−) mice produced significantly increased TNF-α and nitric oxide in the lung compared with SP-A (+/+) mice after intratracheal administration of smooth LPS. Instillation of SP-A to SP-A (−/−) mice restored regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production. Another study (43LeVine A.M. Whitsett J.A. Gwozdz J.A. Richradson T.R. Fisher J.H. Burhans M.S. Korfhagen T.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3934-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) with SP-A (−/−) mice has shown that infection with group B streptococcus and H. influenzae increased the proinflammatory cytokines in the lung. In this report we sought to determine whether the antiinflammatory role for SP-A was also applicable to a PGN stimulus. This study demonstrates in vitro that SP-A attenuates TNF-α release induced by PGN derived from S. aureus. The SP-A effect on PGN responsiveness occurs with the U937 cell line as well as primary alveolar macrophages. The results obtained from this and the previous in vivo (31Borron P. McIntosh J.C.

Maus U. Günther A. Seeger W. Grimminger F. Lohmeyer J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4495-4502PubMed Google Scholar) studies are consistent with the idea that SP-A plays a role in modulating cytokine production and inflammatory responses during bacterial infection within the lung.We also sought to elucidate the mechanism by which SP-A inhibits PGN-elicited TNF-α secretion. Because this study has shown that SP-A does not bind to PGN, the mechanism of the inhibitory effect must be different from that by which MBP inhibits cellular responses caused by streptococcal cell wall components (46Soell M. Lett E. Holveck F. Scholler M. Wachsmann D. Klein J.-P. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 851-860PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter case, the direct interaction of MBP with streptococcal rhamnose glucose polymer (RGP) inhibits RGP-induced TNF-α secretion. A previous study (26Sano H. Sohma H. Muta T. Nomura S. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 387-395PubMed Google Scholar) from this laboratory suggests that one of the possible mechanisms by which SP-A modulates LPS-induced cytokine expression is likely to be due to the interaction of SP-A with the LPS receptor, CD14. CD14 and TLR2 function as pattern recognition receptors for PGN (19Lien E. Sellati T.J. Yoshimura A. Flo T.H. Rawadi G. Finberg R.W. Carroll J.D. Espevik T. Ingalls R.R. Radolf J.D. Golenbock D.T. J.

Although CD14 enhances PGN-induced cell signaling mediated through TLR2, TLR2 alone can induce significant NF-κB activation in response to PGN. In addition, because PGN- or LPS-elicited TNF-α expression is coupled with TLR-mediated NF-κB signaling, we examined the effect of SP-A on PGN-induced NF-κB activation in TLR2-transfected HEK293 cells. SP-A significantly reduced the measured NF-κB activity, indicating that SP-A can alter TLR2-mediated NF-κB signaling.Next, we constructed a soluble form of recombinant extracellular TLR2 domain (sTLR2) and isolated sTLR2 protein expressed by the baculovirus-insect cell expression system. The direct binding of PGN to the extracellular TLR2 domain has now been demonstrated. Additional details about this binding reaction will be described elsewhere.2 The preincubation of SP-A with sTLR2 significantly reduced the binding of sTLR2 to PGN. These results obtained from the cell-free system are essentially consistent with those obtained using U937 cells and alveolar macrophages, although the magnitudes of the SP-A inhibition are different. The expression of TLR2 has been demonstrated in U937 cells (38Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Ayres T.M. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), leukocytes (47Chaudhary P.M. Ferguson C. Nguyen V. Nguyen O. Massa H.F. Eby M. Jasmin A. Trask B.J. Hood L. Nelson P., S. Blood. 1998; 91: 4020-4027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and lung (48Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data support the idea that the direct interaction of SP-A with the extracellular TLR2 domain interfere with PGN binding to TLR2, resulting in decreased TLR2-mediated NF-κB signaling and reduced TNF-α secretion from immune cells. From the present and previous (26Sano H. Sohma H. Muta T. Nomura S. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 387-395PubMed Google Scholar) studies we now propose that SP-A modulates cellular responses induced by bacterial ligands through direct interactions with pattern recognition receptors, CD14, and/or TLR.SP-A almost completely abrogated PGN-induced TNF-α secretion from U937 cells. However, this protein did not completely inhibit PGN-induced cytokine release in alveolar macrophages. The difference between SP-A's inhibitory effects on U937 cells and alveolar macrophages may be due to the different capacity of these cells to secrete TNF-α. Ten μg/ml PGN induced secretion of more than 150 ng/ml TNF-α in alveolar macrophages, whereas the same concentration of PGN applied to U937 cells produced 7.5 ng/ml TNF-α. SP-A exhibited a greater inhibitory effect at lower concentrations of PGN than at higher concentrations in alveolar macrophages, with 80% inhibition at 1 μg/ml versus 33% inhibition at 10 μg/ml. SP-A did significantly attenuate, but did not completely abrogate, PGN-induced NF-κB activation in TLR2-transfected cells or sTLR2 binding to solid phase PGN. The absence of a one to one correlation of the SP-A effect between TNF-α secretion and NF-κB activity or sTLR2 binding to PGN may be a consequence of TLR2 overexpression or altered affinity for sTLR2. The naturally occurring soluble form of mouse TLR4, which is expressed by alternatively spliced mouse TLR4 mRNA, has been shown to only partially block LPS-elicited NF-κB activation (49Iwami K. Matsuguchi T. Masuda A. Kikuchi T. Musikacharoen T. Yoshikai Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 165: 6682-6686Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar), indicating that the extracellular domain alone may not explain all the activity of the receptor-ligand interaction. Clearly, more detailed biochemical data regarding SP-A-TLR2 and PGN-TLR2 interactions and the mechanism of signal transduction and the terminal inhibitory event are required.We have previously shown that SP-A and SP-D bind CD14 by different mechanisms (29Sano H. Chiba H. Iwaki D. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22442-22451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The SP-A neck domain and SP-D lectin domain participate in CD14 binding. SP-A and SP-D recognize a peptide portion and a carbohydrate moiety, respectively, of CD14. MBP also binds CD14 in a manner similar to that of SP-A (30Chiba H. Sano H. Iwaki D. Murakami S. Mutsuzawa H. Takahashi T. Konishi M. Takahashi H. Kuroki Y. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). CD14 and TLRs possess homologous structures consisting of leucine-rich repeats characteristic of a short β-sheet and α-helix (50Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). CD14 and TLR2 contain 10 and 19 leucine-rich repeats, respectively. Because SP-A binds to the CD14 region containing leucine-rich repeats and also binds to deglycosylated sTLR2, 3D. Iwaki and Y. Kuroki, unpublished data. we infer that SP-A may interact with the leucine-rich repeat region of TLR2. The binding of rat SP-A to sCD14 was blocked by a monoclonal antibody that binds to the SP-A neck domain but was not attenuated in the presence of EDTA (29Sano H. Chiba H. Iwaki D. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22442-22451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), indicating that the SP-A neck domain participates in CD14 binding. In this study the binding of human SP-A to sTLR2 was abolished by a monoclonal antibody whose epitope is located at a region contiguous to the human SP-A region Thr184–Gly194 (42Chiba H. Sano H. Saitoh M. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Akino T. Kuroki Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7321-7331Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, it was blocked by the presence of EDTA, indicating that the SP-A binding to sTLR2 is Ca2+-dependent and that the carbohydrate recognition domain is involved in sTLR2 binding. These studies reveal the different mechanisms of the SP-A binding to the pattern recognition receptors. The molecular and mechanistic details by which SP-A and other collectins interact with TLRs are now under investigation.It is relatively difficult to determine the actual SP-A concentrationin vivo since the epithelial lining fluid of the alveolus (alveolar hypophase) cannot be directly measured. Nevertheless, the SP-A concentrations can be estimated based on the recovery of the protein in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and the extrapolated hypophase volume (100–1000 μl/lung) (51Rennard S.I.

The calculated SP-A concentrations in the alveolar hypophase range from 180 μg/ml to 1.8 mg/ml (53Tino M.J. Wright J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L677-L688PubMed Google Scholar, 54van de Graaf E.D.

Rev. 1997; 77: 931-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The levels of SP-A appear to vary in diseased states, indicating complex responses under conditions of physiological stress. In the rat model, the levels of SP-A mRNA and protein are elevated in response to intratracheal administration of LPS (56McIntosh J.C. Swyers A.H. Fisher J.H. Wright J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). SP-A recovered in the lavage fluid also increases in AIDS-related pneumonia (57Phelps D.S. Rose R.M. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 143: 1072-1075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in some situations (58Baughman R.P. Sternberg R.I. Hull W. Buchsbaum J.A. Whitsett J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 147: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the SP-A concentration in lavage fluid decreases in patients with bacterial pneumonia. Although one cannot yet determine the exact concentrations of SP-A in the hypophase of healthy and diseased human lungs, the SP-A concentrations used in these studies are within the best estimates of the physiological ranges.The respiratory system continually faces exposure to airborne LPS, PGN, and microbes. SP-A may play an important role in the elimination of these microbes by enhancing phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages. Although SP-A enhances microbial clearance, it also appears to be an important element in dampening the inflammatory response to some organisms and their derivative cell surface components. Alveolar macrophages and neutrophils produce proinflammatory cytokines through the CD14/TLR pathway in response to microbial components including PGN, LPS, and lipoteichoic acid. TNF-α is a pivotal mediator of the host responses to infections and triggers inflammatory responses. Because overproduction of TNF-α can cause chronic pathological states especially in the lung, the inhibitory function of SP-A on TNF-α release may be crucial regulatory component for controlling pulmonary inflammation.In conclusion, this study demonstrates that SP-A inhibits TNF-α secretion induced by PGN. The results also reveal that SP-A directly binds TLR2, alters the interaction of TLR2 with PGN, and attenuates downstream signaling events. These findings provide one mechanistic framework by which SP-A can regulate inflammatory responses in the alveolar compartment. Pulmonary surfactant is a mixture of lipids and proteins that functions to keep alveoli from collapsing at expiration (1King R.J. Clements J.A. Am. J.

https://openalex.org/W2074501013,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP), formed by sphingosine kinase, is the ligand for EDG-1, a GPCR important for cell migration and vascular maturation. Here we show that cytoskeletal rearrangements, lamellipodia extensions, and cell motility induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are abrogated in EDG-1 null fibroblasts. However, EDG-1 appears to be dispensable for mitogenicity and survival effects, even those induced by its ligand SPP and by PDGF. Furthermore, PDGF induced focal adhesion formation and activation of FAK, Src, and stress-activated protein kinase 2, p38, were dysregulated in the absence of EDG-1. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFR and activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2), important for growth and survival, were unaltered. Our results suggest that EDG-1 functions as an integrator linking the PDGFR to lamellipodia extension and cell migration. PDGF, which stimulates sphingosine kinase, leading to increased SPP levels in many cell types, also induces translocation of sphingosine kinase to membrane ruffles. Hence, recruitment of sphingosine kinase to the cell's leading edge and localized formation of SPP may spatially and temporally stimulate EDG-1, resulting in activation and integration of downstream signals important for directional movement toward chemoattractants, such as PDGF. These results may also shed light on the vital role of EDG-1 in vascular maturation."

In addition to the Aβ peptide which is mostly released from the cell, another peptide, AID, is released into the cytoplasm as a result of the γ-secretase cleavage. Although the role of the Aβ peptide in the pathogenesis of AD has been extensively studied, only recently have there been reports as to the role of AID. AID-like peptides have recently been identified in human brains from normal controls and cases of sporadic AD (21Passer B. Pellegrini L. Russo C. Siegel R.M. Lenardo M.J. Schettini G. Bachmann M. Tabaton M. D'Adamio L. J. Alzheimer's Dis. 2000; 2: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). AID has also been implicated in the pathology of AD by data indicating that it can independently trigger apoptosis or enhance other apoptotic stimuli (21Passer B. Pellegrini L. Russo C. Siegel R.M.

Most recently it has been shown that APP may bind Fe65 and Tip60, and that following γ-secretase cleavage, AID along with Fe65 and Tip60 can travel to the nucleus to act as a transcription factor (28Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). To identify other proteins which are relevant to the function of APP, and that may mediate the functions of AID, we employed the yeast two-hybrid selection system. Here we describe JIP1 (also known as IB1) as a new binding partner of the APP intracellular domain. The two-hybrid screening was conducted using the Matchmaker system from CLONTECHaccording to the manufacturers instruction. Yeast strain Y190 was transformed with the corresponding bait plasmids by the lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol 4000 procedure and selected on synthetic drop-out plates lacking tryptophan. Selected colonies were analyzed for expression of the GAL4BD-bait fusion protein by immunoblot analysis. For library screening, Yeast190 expressing GAL4BD-APP fusion proteins were sequentially transformed with a human fetal brain cDNA library cloned in the pACT2 vector (CLONTECH). 2 × 106 clones were analyzed. Transformed yeast were selected in synthetic drop-out plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine in the presence of 50 mm 3-aminotriazol (Sigma) and grown for 5 days at 30 °C. Colonies positive for growth on selective media were blotted on filter paper (Whatman No. 5), permeabilized in liquid nitrogen, and placed on another filter soaked in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNa2H2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 37.5 β-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 mm5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactosidase. Colonies were then scored as positive when a bright color developed in 2–5 h. Assays were done for 5–10 independent transformants. Two GAL4BD-APP baits were constructed using the pAS2 vector (CLONTECH). Construct pAS2-AT and pAS2-LK consisted of the COOH-terminal 58 amino acids or 48 amino acids of APP fused to the DNA-binding domain (BD) of GAL4, respectively. APP, APPNcas, APPCcas, and AID were made as described previously (21Passer B. Pellegrini L. Russo C. Siegel R.M. Lenardo M.J. Schettini G. Bachmann M. Tabaton M. D'Adamio L. J. Alzheimer's Dis. 2000; 2: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were made in pGEX vectors (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Mutations were introduced by using the transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). From the cDNAs isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screening, hJIP1 clone AT27 was cloned into Flag-tagged pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), pECFP-N1 and pEYFP-N1 (CLONTECH) for expression in mammalian cells or in vitro. Human JIP1e was constructed with the same sequence for hJIP1 (GenBankTM accession number AAD20443) with the first 24 amino acids exchanged for an alternative stretch of 34 amino acids derived from EST IMAGE:2545752 (ATCC). This was cloned into Flag-tagged pcDNA3.1, pECFP-N1 and C1, and pEYFP-N1 and C1. Fragments of hJIP1 were cloned by PCR using Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the following oligonucleotides (Invitrogen): SH3-forward: AAAAGAATTCTGTTCTCCTGCATCATC; SH3-reverse: AAACTCGAGTTAGTCACTGTTTTTGGC; PTB-forward: AAAAGAATTCAGTTCCGGGTGAAGTTCCTG; PTB-reverse: AAACTCGAGTTACTCCACAAACTGCTTGTA. HJIP1-SH3 containing residues 479–562 was cloned using primers SH3-forward and SH3-reverse, hJIP1 PTB containing residues 566–700 was cloned using primers PTB-forward and PTB-reverse and hJIP1-SH3PTB containing residues 479–700 was cloned using primers SH3-forward and PTB-reverse. Appropriate restriction enzymes were used to splice these fragments into Flag-tagged pcDNA3.1, pECFP-C1, and pEYFP-C1. Mouse JIP1a in pCMV5 was obtained as a kind gift from Dr. Roger Davis (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA) (29Dickens M. Rogers J.S.

Mouse JIP1b was constructed by cutting EST IMAGE:4506969 (Incyte Genomics) which codes for the 47-amino acid insertion with EcoO65I and EcoRV and splicing it into mJIP1a already cut with the same enzymes. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by the dideoxy termination method using an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Foster City, CA) by Genewiz Inc. (New York), or by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine sequencing core, using their protocols. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with glutamine and with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Biofluids, Rockville, MD). Transfections were performed in 6-well plates either using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen), 8 μl per 1 μg of DNA, or FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 3 μl per 1 μg of DNA. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21 (Invitrogen) to make nonphosphorylated proteins and strain TKB1 (Stratagene) to make tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins using the pGEX system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Phosphorylation of fusion proteins was confirmed by Western blotting with the PY20 monoclonal anti-phoshotyrosine antibody (Transduction Labs). Proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. [3H]Leucine-labeled proteins were made using the TnT-coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega). After synthesis of the radiolabeled protein for 1.5 h, aliquots of the protein were incubated with GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer T (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 45 mm NaCl) and boiled with SDS loading buffer with dithiothreitol. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the gel were fixed with 50% methanol, 40% H2O, 10% acetic acid. The gel was incubated in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20 min and dried. Pulled down proteins were detected using autoradiography. Twenty-four to forty-eight h following transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer T containing a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysis was allowed to continue for 10 min on ice and was then spun down at full speed at 4 degrees for 10 min. Some lysate representing the total lysate was removed and boiled with SDS loading buffer with dithiothreitol, while the rest was immunoprecipitated for 2 h at room temperature with either monoclonal antibody directed against the Flag epitope already bound to agarose beads (Sigma) or with 2.5 μl of polyclonal Living-Colors antibody (CLONTECH) with 15 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Pierce). The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and boiled with SDS loading buffer with dithiothreitol. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed with the same antibodies as was used for immunoprecipitation and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used. Proteins were detected using the Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent system (Pierce). HEK 293T cells were plated in 24-well plates and co-transfected with the CFP and YFP fusion proteins using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All transfections contained a total of 200 ng of DNA with the ratios between the two determined empirically to yield the best co-expression as follows. All transfections with AID or AID(Y682G) had a DNA ratio of AID to JIP1 of 1:1 while all transfections with APP or APP(Y682G) had a DNA ratio of APP to JIP1 of 4:1. Cells were harvested between 18 and 24 h after transfection in their conditioned media and strained through nylon mesh to separate the cells. A MoFlo Multi Laser Sorter (MLS), (Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO) was configured as follows. An argon laser tuned to 488 nm was used to excite YFP (but doesn't excite CFP) (30Siegel R.M.

YFP emission was detected with a 530-nm/40-nm bandpass filter and CFP emission was detected with a 473-nm/12-nm bandpass filter. FRET was detected with a 550-nm/30-nm bandpass filter using the 413-nm excitation. Each cell was first illuminated with the 488-nm laser to detect the presence of the YFP fusion protein, and then with the 413-nm laser to detect both the presence of CFP via the 473-nm filter and FRET via the 550-nm filter. Appropriate neutral density filters were used to minimize the overlap between the emissions of the two fluorophores. Because of residual spectral overlap between the emission spectra of YFP and CFP 3Clontech web site, www.clontech.com/gfp/excitation.shtml. compensation was adjusted empirically before each FRET session such that no FRET was detected between noninteracting proteins such as free YFP and CFP. The threshold for a positive FRET cell was set using the standard cytometry method of comparing each sample to a negative control which in our case was the Y682G mutant of each APP or AID sample (see “Results” section). Additionally, if a sample did not have a co-transfection profile matching its control it was rejected from our analysis. Acquisition and analysis was done using the Summit version 3.0 software package (Cytomation). Data was displayed to allow for easy visualization of the number of cells that were co-transfected with the two fusion proteins, as well as the percentage of the cells that had the CFP and YFP in close enough proximity to exhibit FRET. Suitable peptide sequences with high antigenicity, hydrophilicity, flexibility, surface probability, and turns in their secondary structure were chosen. The BLAST program (NCBI/National Institutes of Health) was used to compare the peptide sequence against known sequences in the major data bases (GenBankTM etc.) to void similarity and cross-reactivity with other related and unrelated proteins. Cysteine was added to either end of the peptide (if necessary) and was conjugated to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin by Sulfo-SMCC (Pierce-Endogen). Rabbits were immunized, boosted, and bled according to standard protocols. An affinity column was made by conjugating the same peptide used for immunization to aminohexane gel using Sulfo-SMCC. To purify antibodies, antiserum was incubated with the gel for 1–2 h after extensive washing of the column with phosphate-buffered saline. Purified antibodies are first eluted with three 10-ml fractions of KSCN, then with three 10-ml fractions of glycine. The antibodies were finally dialyzed, concentrated and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm to remove antibody aggregates. Adult BALB/c mice (age 3 months) were euthanized, brains were removed and homogenized in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. One mg of protein was used for immunoprecipitations with αAPP (C7 (34Podlisny M.B. Tolan D.R. Selkoe D.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1423-1435PubMed Google Scholar) or 1736 (35Haass C. Koo E.H.

Selkoe (Center for Neurologic Diseases, Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital)) JIP1-NT (Zymed) or rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies (ICN, Aurora, OH). Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation of immunoprecipitates with protein A-agarose beads, washing, and immunoblots as described above. Characterization of the polyclonal JIP1 antibodies JIP-NT and JIP-SH3 (Zymed) is discussed under “Results” and the figure legends. To identify proteins that interact with AID we screened a fetal human brain cDNA library by means of the yeast two-hybrid system. In two screens, bait plasmids pAS2-AT and pAS2-LK expressing a protein consisting of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to either the terminal 48 or 58 amino acids of APP, respectively, were used (Fig.1a). This construct, which did not lead by itself to the activation of the two reporter genesHIS3 and LacZ, was used to screen ∼2 × 106 transformants. Screening for co-activation of both reporter genes resulted in the identification of known APP-binding proteins, such as Fe65 and X11. In addition, we identified 6 independent clones coding for carboxyl-terminal fragments of hJIP1 (Fig. 1b). To confirm the interaction between hJIP1 and APP, an in vitro approach was taken. An3H-labeled hJIP1 protein containing amino acids 244–711 (AT27, see Fig. 1b) was transcribed and translated in vitro and added to either a purified GST-AID or GST-APPCcas (Fig.3a) fusion protein, or GST alone (all bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads). The protein-protein complex was allowed to form under appropriate buffer condition, resolved by gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. Fig.2 shows that the hJIP1 fragment AT27 directly binds to GST-AID and GST-APPCcas (but not to GST alone), whereas another unrelated protein, AIP1 (36Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), does not. The binding of hJIP1 to GST-APPCcas indicate that the point of interaction with APP was localized to the terminal 31 amino acids of APP.Figure 2JIP1 interacts with APP directly. In vitro transcribed and translated (i.) hJIP1 clone AT27, X11 clone AT34 (identified in the same two-hybrid screen) or AIP1 (control protein) were incubated with either GST (−), GST-AID (AID), or GST-Ccas (Ccas) fusion proteins. These GST fusion proteins are schematically represented in Fig.3a.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Considering that other proteins which bind APP in its intracellular domain, such as mDab1, Fe65, and X11, do so via their PTB domains (37Howell B.W.

Additionally, considering that the above proteins bind APP via the Y682ENPTY687motif independent of phosphorylation, we attempted to discover whether this motif was involved in hJIP1s binding and whether phosphorylation of APP was necessary for hJIP1s binding. HEK 293T cells were transfected with constructs expressing either JIP1e, JIP1 AT27, JIP1-SH3-PTB, JIP1-SH3, or JIP1-PTB with either Flag or YFP tags. Cell lysates were incubated with GST-AID, GST-AID expressed in bacteria which phosphorylates tyrosine, GST-AID Y682G, and GST alone under the appropriate buffer condition. The beads were washed and the total lysates and pull downs were resolved by gel electrophoresis. Western blot analysis (Fig. 3b) using either anti-Flag or anti-YFP antibodies revealed that only the hJIP1 proteins containing the PTB domain (i.e. JIP1e, JIP1 AT27, JIP1-SH3-PTB, and JIP1-PTB) were pulled down by AID while the fragment lacking the PTB domain (i.e. JIP1-SH3) was not. Furthermore, we found that APP binds JIP1 independent of tyrosine phosphorylation, but requires the presence of tyrosine 682. To further determine the residues on APP necessary for hJIP1 binding, GST fusion proteins consisting of the final 31 amino acids of APP (APPCcas), APP residues 680–689, or APP residues 682–687 were expressed either in bacteria which phosphorylate or do not phosphorylate tyrosine. These fusion proteins were incubated with lysates from HEK 293T cells transfected with YFP-hJIP1e. Western blot analysis (Fig. 3c) using an anti-YFP antibody revealed that although the amount of hJIP1 pulled down by APPCcas appears not to be effected by phosphorylation, when the number of residues flanking the YENPTY motif is decreased to two on either side, there appears to be a phosphorylation dependence. Furthermore, when these flanking residues are missing, the amount of hJIP1 pulled down is below the limit of detection. This indicates that other residues in the cytoplasmic tail of APP as well as phosphorylation of tyrosine 682 play complementary roles in stabilizing the interaction between APP and hJIP1. Also, although we have demonstrated that phosphorylation of APP is not necessary for hJIP1 binding, it may be important in APP sorting (43Lai A. Sisodia S.S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) or in modulating which of the various proteins which bind the YENPTY motif will do so most strongly. To assess the interaction of hJIP1 and APP in mammalian cells, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with constructs expressing either APP-GFP, APPNcas-GFP, AID-GFP, or APPCcas-GFP along with Flag-hJIP1 AT27 (Fig.4a). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody directed against the Flag epitope (Sigma) followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-GFP antibody. Fig. 4b shows that although Flag-hJIP1 AT27 immunoprecipitates APP, AID, and APPCcas, all of which contain the YENPTY motif, it does not immunoprecipitate APPNcas which lacks the YENPTY motif. Additionally, the reverse immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antibody directed against the GFP epitope and Western blotting with anti-Flag antibody revealed that only APP, AID, and APPCcas can immunoprecipitate hJIP1 AT27 while APPNcas cannot. In the mouse, two forms of mJIP1 have been identified, mJIP1b containing a complete PTB domain, and mJIP1a which lacks 47 amino acids at the beginning of its PTB domain (Fig. 4a) (29Dickens M.

This gave us the opportunity to test in vivo if the lack of a complete PTB domain could abolish mJIP1s interaction with APP. HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with constructs expressing either APP-GFP or APPNcas-GFP along with Flag-mJIP1a or Flag-mJIP1b.

Our previous studies showed that Rab2 promotes vesicle formation from VTCs and that the released vesicles are enriched in β-coat protein, protein kinase C ι/λ (PKCι/λ), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and the recycling protein p53/gp58. Because PKCι/λ kinase activity was necessary for vesicle formation, a search was initiated to identify the substrate(s) that potentiate Rab2 function within VTCs. In this study, we found that PKCι/λ phosphorylates GAPDH. Moreover, GAPDH interacts directly with the PKCι/λ regulatory domain. Based on numerous observations that show (β-COP) GAPDH associates with cytoskeletal elements, we examined the role of phospho-GAPDH in promoting microtubule (MT) binding to membrane. Using a quantitative microsomal binding assay, we found that membrane association of β-tubulin was dependent on phospho-GAPDH and was blocked by reagents that interfere with Rab2-dependent GAPDH membrane recruitment or with PKCι/λ kinase activity. Furthermore, normal rat kidney cells transfected with a constitutively activated form of Rab2 (Q65L) or with our anti-GAPDH polyclonal antibody displayed a dramatic change in MT organization.

Phosphatase inhibitors have been reported to arrest endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 to Golgi transport (1Davidson H.W. McGowan C.H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1343-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), transport from the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface (2Brewer C. Roth M. J.

For some transport-related proteins, phosphorylation modulates their activity as well as influences the phosphoproteins cellular location. For example, phosphorylation of membrane-associated Rab1 and Rab4 promotes their redistribution to the cytosol (4Bailly E. McCaffrey M. Touchot N. Zahraoui A. Goud B. Bornens M. Nature. 1991; 350: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Huber L.A. Mâle P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Rab1 and Rab4 are two members of the Rab GTPase family that includes more than 40 members that regulate vesicular traffic between specific compartments of the endocytic and exocytic pathways (6Martinez O. Goud B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 7Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Like Rab1, Rab2 is required for membrane traffic in the early secretory pathway (8Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The Rab2 protein immunolocalizes to pre-Golgi intermediates composed of vesicles and tubular clusters (vesicular tubular clusters, VTCs) (9Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). VTCs serve as transport intermediates between the ER and the Golgi complex and are the first site of segregation of the anterograde and retrograde pathways (10Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 11Martinez-Menarguez J.A. Geuze H. Slot J. Klumperman J.

PKCι is the human homolog of mouse PKCλ, and both share homology with the third member of the atypical PKC family, PKCζ. The atypical PKCs are activated by the lipid second messengers phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and ceramide as well as by protein-protein interactions that direct the PKC in proximity of its cognate substrate. Most likely different binding partners are required to integrate the multitude of signaling pathways in which PKC is a participant.Our previous finding that kinase activity was necessary for vesicle formation prompted a search for the PKCι/λ substrate(s) that potentiates Rab2 function within VTCs. Interestingly, three proteins that associate with VTCs have been reported to undergo phosphorylation and include Rab2, β-COP, and GAPDH. In that regard, phospho-Rab2 was found in HeLa and COS-1 cells biosynthetically labeled with32Pi (15Tachibana K. Umezawa A. Takano T. Biochem. Int. 1992; 28: 181-189PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies did not identify the responsible kinase, it is possible that PKC is involved because Rab2 contains six predicted PKC phosphorylation sites (16Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). The β-COP protein is probably the best characterized of the seven subunits that comprise coatomer. This polypeptide contains three consensus PKC serine phosphorylation sites that may regulate recruitment of COPI (coatomer and ADP ribosylation factor) to specific intracellular compartments (17Sheff D. Lowe M. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7230-7236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Lastly, it has been reported that GAPDH undergoes autophosphorylation as well as phosphatidylserine (PS)-dependent phosphorylation by PKC (18Kawamoto R. Caswell A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 656-661Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Reiss N. Oplatka A. Hermon J. Naor Z. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 40: 1191-1200PubMed Google Scholar, 20Reiss N. Hermon J. Oplatka A. Naor Z. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 711-719PubMed Google Scholar). Although GAPDH is commonly known as a key enzyme in glycolysis (GAPDH catalyzes the NAD-mediated oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 1,3-diphosphoglycerate), a number of intriguing intracellular roles have been reported including modulation of the cytoskeleton, kinase activity, and the promotion of vesicle fusion (18Kawamoto R. Caswell A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 656-661Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar,21Harris J. Waters M.G. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 13. Academic Press, New York1976: 1-49Google Scholar, 22Kumagai H.

Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These activities are all essential to the maintenance of membrane trafficking. Furthermore, we found recently that GAPDH is required for transport in the early secretory pathway. Our affinity-purified anti-GAPDH polyclonal antibody was a potent inhibitor of ER to Golgi traffic (14Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2480-2486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).We began our search for the PKCι/λ substrate(s) that participates in this trafficking event by first focusing our attention on these three proteins. In this study we found that unlike Rab2 and β-COP, GAPDH was phosphorylated efficiently by PKCι/λ in an in vitro kinase assay. GAPDH is not only a substrate for PKCι/λ, but also interacts directly with PKCι/λ via its regulatory domain. Moreover, a quantitative microsomal binding assay showed that Rab2-dependent GAPDH recruitment to membranes results in GAPDH phosphorylation by membrane-associated PKCι/λ. Because there were numerous reports showing that GAPDH binds to microtubules (MTs) resulting in the formation of cross-linked structures or bundles, we examined the effect of GAPDH on MT membrane association and intracellular distribution in the early secretory pathway. Interestingly, phospho-GAPDH promoted tubulin binding to microsomes which was inhibited by reagents that interfere with Rab2-dependent GAPDH membrane recruitment or with PKCι/λ kinase activity. Furthermore, NRK cells protein transfected with constitutively activated Rab2 (Q65L) or with our affinity-purified anti-GAPDH polyclonal antibody displayed a striking and opposite consequence on MT organization.These combined results implicate a mechanistic link among Rab2-stimulated PKCι/λ recruitment, GAPDH membrane binding, and subsequent phosphorylation. We propose that phospho-GAPDH is necessary for MT binding to the VTC subcompartment that contains Rab2. The MTs associated with this VTC subcompartment may then provide tracks that direct movement of the retrograde vesicle back to the ER.DISCUSSIONWe learned from our previous studies that Rab2 required PKCι/λ to recruit β-COP to membranes (12Tisdale E.J. Jackson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17269-17277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although kinase activity was necessary for this event, the PKCι/λ substrate(s) that potentiated Rab2 activity in vesicle formation was not known (13Tisdale E.J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified GAPDH as a substrate for PKCι/λ. GAPDH is efficiently phosphorylated by purified PKCι/λ in an in vitro kinase assay. Moreover, PKCι/λ phosphorylation of GAPDH is specific based on the fact that no phospho-GAPDH was detected when the assay was supplemented with either the unique pseudosubstrate peptide or the kinase-deficient enzyme.It has been reported that GAPDH undergoes autophosphorylation with MgATP and that the resulting phosphoprotein contains an acyl phosphate that has phosphotransferase properties (18Kawamoto R. Caswell A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 656-661Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, we did not detect autophosphorylated GAPDH. Likewise, Reiss and co-workers (19Reiss N. Oplatka A. Hermon J. Naor Z. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 40: 1191-1200PubMed Google Scholar, 20Reiss N. Hermon J. Oplatka A. Naor Z. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 711-719PubMed Google Scholar) found no GAPDH autophosphorylation. Consistent with our findings, these investigators reported that GAPDH was phosphorylated by PKC and that PS stimulated the phosphorylation rate. It is possible that GAPDH undergoes a minor degree of autophosphorylation which was not detected because of the strong radioactive signal obtained from PKCι/λ phosphorylation of GAPDH which allowed us to process the autoradiogram for several hours. However, treatment with acid phosphatase released all of the radiolabel from GAPDH, indicating that the incorporated34PO 4− was in the form of an ester linkage. Because protein kinase catalyzes the formation of an ester phosphate on proteins, phospho-GAPDH is the result of PKCι/λ kinase activity. This type of linkage also indicates that the phospho-GAPDH produced in the kinase assay is most likely not involved in phosphotransferase activity because ester phosphates (seryl and threonyl) are not high energy phosphate transport intermediates. Our preliminary Western blot results using phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-specific monoclonal antibodies suggest that the modified residue is a serine. There are four potential serine PKC phosphorylation sites in GAPDH, and we are currently pursuing the identification of the phosphorylated residue(s).PKC activation involves translocation from the cytosol to subcellular sites that include the ER, Golgi complex, nucleus, as well as the cytoskeleton. Specific binding proteins mediate localization by placing the PKC in proximity of its substrate (34Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). A PKC-binding protein may serve both as substrate and to anchor the PKC to the appropriate target membrane. The polypeptides that provide those two functions are PS-binding proteins (28Hyatt S.D. Liao L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Jaken S. Parker P.J. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 35Wolf M. Sahyoun N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13327-13332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that PKCι/λ interacted with membrane-associated GAPDH using a gel overlay assay and that this binding required PS. It has been proposed that PS serves to bridge PKC to other PS-binding proteins and that the phospholipid-dependent interactions are stabilized additionally by protein-protein interactions (28Hyatt S.D. Liao L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Jaken S. Parker P.J. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Because the association of PKC to PS-binding proteins occurs in part at the pseudosubstrate site located in the regulatory domain, residues 1–247 of PKCι/λ were assessed for the ability to interact with GAPDH (36Liao L. Hyatt S.L. Chapline C. Jaken S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We detected GAPDH bound to the PKCι/λ regulatory domain, whereas no binding was found to the catalytic half of the molecule. Furthermore, the interaction between GAPDH and PKCι/λ was partly blocked in the presence of the pseudosubstrate peptide. These combined results indicate that the interaction of PKCι/λ with GAPDH is mediated partially through the PKCι/λ pseudosubstrate domain. Therefore, PKCι/λ and GAPDH associate via lipid protein interaction as well as protein-protein interaction.The pseudosubstrate or autoinhibitory domain is present in the regulatory domain of all PKC isozymes. The regulatory domain not only contains motifs involved in the binding of phospholipid cofactors and calcium but also participates in protein-protein interactions. For example, the novel protein modulators lambda-interacting protein and Par-4 have been reported to interact with the regulatory domain of PKCι (39Diaz-Meco M. Munico M. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40De Sanchez P. Carcer G. Sandoval I. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3069-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Additionally, Ras binds to the regulatory domain of PKCζ (41Diaz-Meco M. Lozano J. Munico M. Berra E. Frutos S. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31706-31710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike these protein-protein interactions that either promote or inhibit PKC kinase activity, another class of proteins (STICKS) bind to the PKC regulatory domain and is a substrate for the isozyme. In several cases, PKC phosphorylation of a STICK has been shown to modify its activity (26Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chapline C. Cottom J. Tobin H. Hulmes J. Crabb J. Jaken S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19329-19338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For instance, phosphorylation of the STICK called clone 72 results in the accumulation of this protein in membrane protrusions and ruffles, implicating a role in cytoskeletal alteration (27Chapline C. Cottom J. Tobin H. Hulmes J. Crabb J. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19482-19489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Another protein identified as a STICK is adducin. PKC phosphorylation of this cytoskeletal protein inhibits actin capping and spectrin recruiting activity (42Li X. Matsuoka Y. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19329-19338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Lastly, GAP-43 is a STICK that binds to actin and has been implicated in neurite outgrowth (43Benowitz L.I. Routtenberg A. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 84-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). PKCι/λ phosphorylation of GAPDH may function in a similar manner and initiate cytoskeletal remodeling at the VTC. In that regard, PKCι has been reported to participate in Ras- and Cdc42-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (44Uberall F. Hellbert K. Kampfer S. Maly K. Villunger A. Spitaler M. Mwanjewe J. Baier-Bitterlich G. Baier G. Grunicke H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 45Coghlan M. Chou M. Carpenter C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).GAPDH was the first glycolytic enzyme found associated with tubulin (22Kumagai H. Sakai H. J. Biochem. 1983; 93: 1259-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 46Huitorel P. Pantaloni D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 150: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 47Durrieu C. Bernier-Valentin F. Rousset B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 74: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In fact, a GAPDH-specific binding domain has been identified at the carboxyl terminus of α-tubulin (residues 409–451 designated T-GEBD-43mer) (48Volker K.W. Knull H.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). GAPDH is known to modulate the cytoskeleton by promoting MT bundling (49MacRae T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1160: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These dynamic complexes may be involved in motility or simply provide spatial organization within the cell because MTs control both organelle position and intracompartmental transport of vesicular and tubular elements. To determine whether GAPDH had any influence on MTs, microsomes recovered from the binding assay were analyzed for tubulin content. We found that β-tubulin recruitment to membrane was not only dependent on membrane-associated GAPDH but also required the phosphorylated form, an observation similar to that described above for STICKS. The role of GAPDH in the early secretory pathway may be to nucleate MT bundling at anchorage sites within a VTC subcompartment that binds Rab2. GAPDH could work in conjunction with MT bundles by providing energy and coordinating motile processes for retrograde vesicle movement to the ER. Although MT and actin assembly does not appear to be regulated directly by small GTPases, Rab proteins provide a molecular link for vesicle movement to the appropriate target. In support of this idea, Rab5 has been shown to regulate endosome interaction with the MT network (50Nielsen E. Severin F. Backer J. Hyman A. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Both Rab6 and Rab8 are involved in cytoskeletal interaction and organization (51Echard A. Jollivet F. Martinez O. Lacapere J.J. Rousselet A. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Goud B. Science. 1998; 279: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 52Spaargaren M. Bos J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3239-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Rab8 (Q67L) produces clusters of bundled MTs and actin in BHK cells (53Peranen J. Auvinen P. Virta H. Wepf R. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We found that Rab2 produces a similar phenotype. NRK cells transfected with a constitutively activated form of Rab2 showed a dramatic change in microtubule organization. The MTs appeared to organize into cross-linked structures or bundles located in the Golgi region. Interestingly, these structures also immunostained for GAPDH. These results imply a causal link between GAPDH binding and MT remodeling and are supported by the observation that cells transfected with anti-GAPDH antibody showed altered MT distribution. The fact that MTs are dynamic polymers that respond to signaling pathways by changing their organization suggests that second messengers may also regulate the early secretory pathway. Protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events play a critical role in the regulation of intracellular membrane traffic. Phosphatase inhibitors have been reported to arrest endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 to Golgi transport (1Davidson H.W. McGowan C.H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1343-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), transport from the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface (2Brewer C. Roth M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1343-1355Google Scholar), as well as fluid phase endocytosis (3Lucocq J. Warren G. Pryde J. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 753-759PubMed Google Scholar). For some transport-related proteins, phosphorylation modulates their activity as well as influences the phosphoproteins cellular location. For example, phosphorylation of membrane-associated Rab1 and Rab4 promotes their redistribution to the cytosol (4Bailly E. McCaffrey M. Touchot N. Zahraoui A. Goud B. Bornens M. Nature. 1991; 350: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Huber L.A. Mâle P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Rab1 and Rab4 are two members of the Rab GTPase family that includes more than 40 members that regulate vesicular traffic between specific compartments of the endocytic and exocytic pathways (6Martinez O. Goud B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 7Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Like Rab1, Rab2 is required for membrane traffic in the early secretory pathway (8Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The Rab2 protein immunolocalizes to pre-Golgi intermediates composed of vesicles and tubular clusters (vesicular tubular clusters, VTCs) (9Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). VTCs serve as transport intermediates between the ER and the Golgi complex and are the first site of segregation of the anterograde and retrograde pathways (10Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 11Martinez-Menarguez J.A. Geuze H. Slot J. Klumperman J. Cell. 1999; 98: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In our ongoing studies to characterize the role of Rab2 in secretion, we found that Rab2 requires protein kinase C ι/λ (PKCι/λ) activity to generate retrograde-directed vesicles enriched in β-coat protein (β-COP), PKCι/λ, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and the recycling protein p53/gp58 (12Tisdale E.J. Jackson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17269-17277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Tisdale E.J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2480-2486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). PKCι is the human homolog of mouse PKCλ, and both share homology with the third member of the atypical PKC family, PKCζ. The atypical PKCs are activated by the lipid second messengers phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and ceramide as well as by protein-protein interactions that direct the PKC in proximity of its cognate substrate. Most likely different binding partners are required to integrate the multitude of signaling pathways in which PKC is a participant. Our previous finding that kinase activity was necessary for vesicle formation prompted a search for the PKCι/λ substrate(s) that potentiates Rab2 function within VTCs. Interestingly, three proteins that associate with VTCs have been reported to undergo phosphorylation and include Rab2, β-COP, and GAPDH. In that regard, phospho-Rab2 was found in HeLa and COS-1 cells biosynthetically labeled with32Pi (15Tachibana K. Umezawa A. Takano T. Biochem. Int. 1992; 28: 181-189PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies did not identify the responsible kinase, it is possible that PKC is involved because Rab2 contains six predicted PKC phosphorylation sites (16Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). The β-COP protein is probably the best characterized of the seven subunits that comprise coatomer. This polypeptide contains three consensus PKC serine phosphorylation sites that may regulate recruitment of COPI (coatomer and ADP ribosylation factor) to specific intracellular compartments (17Sheff D. Lowe M. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7230-7236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Lastly, it has been reported that GAPDH undergoes autophosphorylation as well as phosphatidylserine (PS)-dependent phosphorylation by PKC (18Kawamoto R. Caswell A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 656-661Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Reiss N. Oplatka A. Hermon J. Naor Z. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 40: 1191-1200PubMed Google Scholar, 20Reiss N. Hermon J. Oplatka A. Naor Z. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 711-719PubMed Google Scholar). Although GAPDH is commonly known as a key enzyme in glycolysis (GAPDH catalyzes the NAD-mediated oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 1,3-diphosphoglycerate), a number of intriguing intracellular roles have been reported including modulation of the cytoskeleton, kinase activity, and the promotion of vesicle fusion (18Kawamoto R. Caswell A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 656-661Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar,21Harris J. Waters M.G. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 13. Academic Press, New York1976: 1-49Google Scholar, 22Kumagai H.

Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These activities are all essential to the maintenance of membrane trafficking. Furthermore, we found recently that GAPDH is required for transport in the early secretory pathway. Our affinity-purified anti-GAPDH polyclonal antibody was a potent inhibitor of ER to Golgi traffic (14Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2480-2486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We began our search for the PKCι/λ substrate(s) that participates in this trafficking event by first focusing our attention on these three proteins. In this study we found that unlike Rab2 and β-COP, GAPDH was phosphorylated efficiently by PKCι/λ in an in vitro kinase assay. GAPDH is not only a substrate for PKCι/λ, but also interacts directly with PKCι/λ via its regulatory domain. Moreover, a quantitative microsomal binding assay showed that Rab2-dependent GAPDH recruitment to membranes results in GAPDH phosphorylation by membrane-associated PKCι/λ. Because there were numerous reports show"

Three criteria suggested that 11 mutant strains were altered in the V-ATPase: 1) these strains accumulated high amounts of arginine when grown at pH 5.8 in the presence of bafilomycin, 2) the mutation mapped to the locus ofvma-3, which encodes the proteolipid subunit c of the V-ATPase, and 3) V-ATPase activity in purified vacuolar membranes was resistant to bafilomycin.

In eucaryotic cells, this enzyme plays a role in many physiological processes. It is present in several types of cellular organelles such as vacuoles, lysosomes, coated vesicles, Golgi, and secretory vesicles (reviewed in Refs. 1Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 2Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The role of the V-ATPase in physiological processes has often been examined by measuring the effects of bafilomycin and concanamycin, macrolide antibiotics that are potent inhibitors of the enzyme (5Dröse S. Altendorf K. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Effective at nanomolar concentrations in vitro, these two drugs also inhibit the V-ATPase in living cells, although higher concentrations, typically 0.1–10.0 μm, are required (6Bowman E.J. O'Neill F.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At low concentrations, the two antibiotics appear to be highly specific for V-ATPases; at 10,000-fold higher concentrations, they inhibit some P-type ATPases in vitro (7Dröse S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 8Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). Because of their effectiveness and specificity in vivo, bafilomycin and concanamycin are attractive candidates for development as therapeutic agents (9Keeling D.J. Herslof M. Ryberg B. Sjogren S. Solvell L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 600-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10Nelson N. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For example, considerable effort has been made to develop bafilomycin derivatives for the treatment of osteoporosis (11Gagliardi S. Nadler G. Consolandi E. Parini C. Morvan M. Legave M.N. Belfiore P.

Invest. 2000; 106: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Bafilomycin and concanamycin are also potent anti-tumor agents that exhibit significant cell line specificity (15Boyd M.R. Farina C. Belfiore P. Gagliardi S. Kim J.W. Hayakawa Y. Beutler J.A. McKee T.C. Bowman B.J. Bowman E.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 114-120PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, derivatives of these inhibitors might be effective in treating cancer. The pharmacological potential of these drugs has prompted several laboratories to develop methods for total synthesis of both bafilomycin and concanamycin (16Evans D.A. Calter M.A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993; 34: 6871-6874Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Toshima K. Jyojima T. Yamaguchi H. Noguchi Y. Yoshida T. Murase H. Nakata M. Matsumura S. J. Org.

Chem. 2001; 66: 1708-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The binding site of these V-ATPase inhibitors has not been determined. At least 13 different polypeptides are required for a functional enzyme. Eight types of subunits (A–H) form the V1 sector, a ball and stalk structure that protrudes from the membrane. Five other types of subunits (a, c, c′,c“, and d) form the V0sector, which conducts protons through the membrane. In the proposed rotary mechanism for the V-ATPase, the c, c′, and c” subunits are part of a rotor, driven by the hydrolysis of ATP in the V1sector (19Grabe M. Wang H. Oster G. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2798-2813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The d and a subunits are stationary within the membrane. Proton transport is hypothesized to occur at the interface between the a subunit and the rotating c, c′, and c“ subunits. Several investigators have proposed that bafilomycin and concanamycin bind to the V0 sector. Adding an excess of the V0sector, but not of the V1 sector, protected the enzyme against inhibition (20Mattsson J.P. Keeling D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Hanada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using isolated subunit a, suggesting that this subunit contains a bafilomycin binding site (22Zhang J. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23518-23523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other data indicate that the small proteolipid subunits may have a binding site. An affinity column with bafilomycin as the fixed ligand specifically bound a 17-kDa subunit (presumably subunit c) (23Rautiala T.J. Koskinen A.M. Vaananen H.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Similarly, bafilomycin was reported to block proton flow through the isolated V0 (24Crider B.P. Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17379-17381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and tritiated bafilomycin was found to copurify with the V0 sector (20Mattsson J.P. Keeling D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The inhibition of V-ATPase by bafilomycin and concanamycin in some ways resembles the inhibition of certain F1F0-ATP synthases (F-ATPases) by oligomycin and venturicidin. Although their structures are significantly different (Fig.1), all of these inhibitors are macrolide antibiotics that bind to the integral membrane sector of their respective enzymes with high specificity and with similar affinities (25Sebald W. Hoppe J. Curr. Topics Bioenerg. 1981; 12: 1-63Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 26Galanis M. Mattoon J.R. Nagley P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). F- and V-ATPases evolved from a common ancestor, raising the possibility that both types of enzymes possess an antibiotic binding site at a similar location. Mutations that confer resistance to oligomycin and venturicidin lie in the a and c subunits. The c, c′, and c“ subunits of V-ATPases are clearly homologs of the c subunit of F-ATPases, with a significant degree of sequence similarity (27Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 28Mandel M. Moriyama Y. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5521-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The a subunits of the two ATPases are not similar in sequence but have been hypothesized to have the same structural and functional role (29Leng X.H. Manolson M.F. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We previously reported the isolation of mutant strains of the fungusNeurospora crassa that were resistant to concanamycin (6Bowman E.J. O'Neill F.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although we obtained resistant strains, none of them had mutations that changed the affinity of the V-ATPase for the inhibitor. The mutations allowed the organism to overcome the toxic effects of concanamycin, although the drug still entered the cells and inhibited the V-ATPase. In this report, we have used bafilomycin to screen for drug-resistant mutations. These experiments have yielded a new class of mutant strains in which the affinity of the V-ATPase for the antibiotic is altered. Strains 74A and 74a were used as the wild type. The am al-3 strain, which is an amino acid auxotroph and an albino color mutant, was used for genetic mapping. Strains were maintained on Vogel's medium N (a minimal medium salt solution at pH 5.8) supplemented with 2% sucrose (30Davis R.H. Neurospora: Contributions of a Model Organism. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 283-303Google Scholar). Alanine (200 mg/liter) was also added when growing strains with theam mutation. For experiments designed to test resistance to bafilomycin, this medium was modified by the addition of 20 mm HEPES buffer and was adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. Bafilomycin from a 10 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide was added after the medium was autoclaved. To determine the rate of growth, 4 liters of Vogel's medium was inoculated with 106 conidia (asexual spores)/ml and aerated vigorously at 25 °C. The dry weight of 50–100-ml samples was determined during the exponential phase of growth (11–18 h after inoculation). Standard methods for growth, mutagenesis, and genetic analysis of N. crassa were those of Davis (30Davis R.H. Neurospora: Contributions of a Model Organism. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 283-303Google Scholar). Conidia from wild-type strain 74A were mutagenized by exposure to ultraviolet light and spread on agar plates containing Vogel's medium, adjusted to pH 7.2, and 0.3 or 1.0 μm bafilomycin. After 1–3 days at 25 °C, 98 of the larger, more vigorous colonies were transferred to 2-ml agar slants of the same medium, containing 0.3 μmbafilomycin. To determine whether the resistance to bafilomycin was heritable and to generate homokaryotic strains, each of these cultures was back-crossed with the 74a strain. Progeny from each mating were then tested by germinating ascospores on agar plates containing Vogel's medium, pH 7.2, with 0.6 μm bafilomycin. Three to five strongly growing colonies were transferred to Vogel's medium, pH 5.8, and retested by spotting conidia on Vogel's medium, pH 7.2, with 1.0 μm bafilomycin. Growth was scored after 2 days at 30 °C. The bafilomycin-resistant strains were mated to theam al-3 strain to determine whether the mutation was linked to the vma-3 locus, which encodes subunit c of the V-ATPase (31Sista H. Wechser M.A. Bowman B.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Most progeny were scored by color and by growth on medium containing bafilomycin. For a few strains, linkage to theam locus was also scored by comparing growth on medium containing glycine versus medium containing alanine. Representative strains of the different types of vma-3mutations (see “Results”) were back-crossed to the 74 strain a second time. Cultures were inoculated with 106 conidia/10 ml of Vogel's medium N, supplemented with 2% sucrose. Bafilomycin was added to the medium at the concentrations indicated under “Results.” The cultures were shaken for 2 days at 25 °C. Harvesting of the cells and determination of arginine contents were as described (6Bowman E.J. O'Neill F.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Vacuolar membranes were prepared as described (32Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. Packer L. Fleischer S. Biomembranes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1997: 861-872Google Scholar) and modified (6Bowman E.J. O'Neill F.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Protein and ATPase activities were assayed as described (6Bowman E.J. O'Neill F.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), except that assays were typically done at 37 °C. Bafilomycin and concanamycin were added to assay mixtures from 10 mm stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) was added from a 100 mm stock solution in ethanol. In all assays, the reaction was started by the addition of vacuolar membranes. DNA was prepared from 20 mg of lyophilized mycelia, using the DNeasy Plant Kit (Qiagen). The protein coding region of the vma-3 gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The 5′ primer was CACGGCAATCTCCAATTC, and the 3′ primer was the reverse complement of GAACTCGGTCTAGGTCTCC. Amplified DNA of 1,080 bp was purified by separation on agarose gels and extraction by the Geneclean procedure (Bio 101). The same primers were used for the sequencing reactions, performed by the DNA Sequencing Facility at the University of California, Berkeley. The bafilomycin A1 used in almost all of these experiments was a gift from Dr. C. Farina and Dr. S. Gagliardi (SmithKline Beecham, Milan, Italy). In a control experiment with the bafilomycin-resistant strain bfr89, we observed the same degree of inhibition of ATPase activity with bafilomycin A1 obtained from Kamiya Biomedical Co. Bafilomycins B1, C, and D, were a gift from Dr. K. Altendorf (University of Osnabrück) and Dr. A. Zeeck (University of Göttingen). Concanamycin A1 came from Kamiya Biomedical Co. To determine conditions for the selection of mutant strains, conidia were spread on plates containing growth medium adjusted to pH 7.2 and 0.01–3.00 μm bafilomycin. At a concentration of 0.3 μm bafilomycin, ∼0.1% of the conidia germinated and formed tiny colonies after 2 days. Fewer than 0.01% of the conidia grew in medium with 1.0 μm bafilomycin. To select mutant strains, conidia of strain 74A were exposed to ultraviolet irradiation and spread on plates containing either 0.3 or 1.0 μmbafilomycin. After 2–3 days, many conidia had germinated and formed tiny colonies with highly branched hyphae, even on the higher concentration of bafilomycin. Selecting larger colonies with more normal morphology, we isolated 70 colonies in the first 2 days and an additional 28 colonies from the third day. The isolates were designated bfr1–bfr98 (forbafilomycin-resistant). All of the isolates were mated to the wild-type strain 74a. Eighty-seven of the 98 bfr isolates produced ascospores that germinated on growth medium adjusted to pH 7.2 containing 0.6 μmbafilomycin. Some of the isolates produced tiny colonies, indicating that the bafilomycin greatly restricted their growth, whereas other colonies grew more vigorously on the bafilomycin. As shown in Fig.2, the most vigorous isolates produced colonies that were slightly larger than the best of the concanamycin-resistant mutant strains we had previously isolated (6Bowman E.J. O'Neill F.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Isolates were selected from the germinated ascospores and tested further by spreading conidia on plates containing 1.0 μmbafilomycin. Fifty-five of the strains were scored as significantly resistant to bafilomycin. To determine whether the V-ATPase was resistant to bafilomycin in vivo, we measured the concentration of arginine in bfr strains grown in liquid medium containing 0.3 μm bafilomycin. In N. crassa, large amounts of arginine are accumulated in the vacuoles by a mechanism that depends on the function of the V-ATPase (6Bowman E.J. O'Neill F.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 33Bowman E.J. Kendle R. Bowman B.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 8877-8882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous experiments in which we selected for resistance to concanamycin, none of the resistant strains had mutations in genes encoding the V-ATPase. Instead, they had mutations that partially suppressed the toxic effects of concanamycin (6Bowman E.J. O'Neill F.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In these ccr strains, concanamycin still entered the cell and inhibited the V-ATPase, as evidenced by the fact that the cells had only 15–20% of the normal concentration of arginine when concanamycin was added to the medium. By contrast, in 43 of the bfr strains the concentration of arginine was at least double that of the wild type strain 74A when grown in the presence of bafilomycin. From this group of isolates we chose 22 strains with higher arginine levels for further analysis (Table I).Table IProperties of bfr mutant strainsStrainArginine contentLinkage to vma-3Bafilomycin resistance of V-ATPase in vitronmol/mg74A5Nobfr1420YesYesbfr2118YesYesbfr3316YesYesbfr3513YesYesbfr6515YesYesbfr7116YesYesbfr7617YesYesbfr8114YesND1-aND, not done.bfr8315YesNDbfr8625YesYesbfr8922YesYesbfr613NoNobfr1511NoNobfr2215NDNobfr2815NoNobfr7216NoNobfr7913NoNDbfr8413NoNDbfr8511NoNDbfr9418NoNobfr9511NoNobfr9814NoNDThree properties of wild-type strain 74A and 22 bfr mutant strains were compared.

In the absence of bafilomycin, strain 74A had 27–30 nmol/mg. Linkage of the bafilomycin-resistant mutation to vma-3 was determined by scoring the color of the closely linked marker gene, al-3(albino) versus wild type (orange), and growth on alkaline medium containing bafilomycin in plate spot tests.

Vacuolar membranes were isolated to measure the effect of bafilomycin on V-ATPase activityin vitro. See “Experimental Procedures” for details. Other investigators have suggested that bafilomycin and concanamycin may bind to the c subunit of the V-ATPase (23Rautiala T.J. Koskinen A.M. Vaananen H.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which is encoded by vma-3 in N. crassa (31Sista H. Wechser M.A. Bowman B.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Becausevma-3 is closely linked to the am (amidation) andal-3 (albino) genes, 21 of the bfr strains described above were mated to the am al-3 strain. In the bfr21 strain, resistance to bafilomycin mapped between the am andal-3 loci, 2 map units (2% recombination) from each, precisely where the vma-3 gene is located. Ten other bfr strains showed tight linkage to al-3 (0–5% recombination); three bfr strains showed loose linkage (25–30% recombination); and seven bfr strains showed no linkage (∼50% recombination) (TableI). To test the effect of bafilomycin on V-ATPase activity in vitro, vacuolar membranes were prepared from nine of the bfr strains that showed tight linkage to al-3, the putativevma-3 mutants, and from seven other bfr strains (Table I). In all nine putative vma-3 mutant strains, the vacuolar ATPase was resistant to bafilomycin in vitro. The concentration required for half-maximal inhibition was 10–20-fold higher than in the wild-type strain (data not shown). In the seven other bfr strains tested, the sensitivity of V-ATPase activity to bafilomycin was the same as in the wild-type strain. To determine whether the vma-3 gene was mutated in the 11 bfr strains that showed tight linkage of resistance to al-3, the region corresponding to the open reading frame was amplified by PCR and sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In all 11 strains, a single codon in the vma-3 gene was altered (TableII). In two brf strains, Thr32 was changed to Ile, and in two others Phe136 was changed to Leu. In seven strains, Tyr143 was changed either to Asn or to His. Thr32 is in the loop region between the first and second predicted membrane helices of subunit c. Phe136 and Tyr143 are in the fourth membrane helix of subunit c, on either side of the putative proton-binding site at Glu138. All three residues are highly conserved in V-ATPases; they are identical in fungi, plants, and animals (31Sista H. Wechser M.A. Bowman B.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The positions of the mutations at Phe136 and Tyr143 are particularly interesting because they correspond to the positions of mutations that confer resistance to oligomycin and/or venturicidin in the homologous F-ATPases. One strain was selected for each type of mutation: bfr21 (F136L), bfr33 (T32I), bfr65 (Y143H), and bfr89 (Y143N). The four were back-crossed a second time to strain 74A/a and used for subsequent characterization.Table IIMutations in the vma-3 gene in bfr strainsStrainCodon changedResidue changedbfr14TTC → CTCPhe136 → Leubfr21TTC → CTCPhe136 → Leubfr33ACT → ATTThr32→ Ilebfr76ACT → ATTThr32 → Ilebfr35TAC → AACTyr143 → Asnbfr81TAC → AACTyr143 → Asnbfr83TAC → AACTyr143 → Asnbfr86TAC → AACTyr143 → Asnbfr89TAC → AACTyr143 → Asnbfr65TAC → CACTyr143 → Hisbfr71TAC → CACTyr143 → His Open table in a new tab The bfr21, bfr33, bfr65, and bfr89 strains had normal hyphal morphology and fertility. Strains bfr33, bfr65, and bfr89 produced fewer conidia, in part because erratic sections of aerial mycelia failed to differentiate. Because vma null strains inN. crassa are unable to produce conidia (33Bowman E.J. Kendle R. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 167-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), this phenotype might suggest a lower level of V-ATPase activity in the bfr mutants. The growth rate in the normal laboratory medium (Vogels, pH 5.8) was nearly the same as the wild type for bfr21, but bfr33, bfr65, and bfr89 had 15–40% longer doubling times (TableIII). The effect of the mutations on vacuolar function and resistance of the V-ATPase to bafilomycinin vivo was examined by measuring the amount of arginine in cells after growth in varying concentrations of bafilomycin (Fig.3). The cells were grown in medium adjusted to pH 5.8, conditions in which the wild-type strain grows well, even in the presence of bafilomycin. The arginine concentration in the wild-type strain decreased by 50% in 0.1 μmbafilomycin and by 88% in 1.0 μm bafilomycin. By contrast, the bfr strains were able to accumulate significant levels of arginine in the presence of bafilomycin. It appeared to take 10–20-fold more bafilomycin to decrease the arginine to the levels observed in the wild-type strain. However, these data also showed that the brf strains were partly defective in their ability to accumulate arginine. In the absence of the inhibitor, the arginine concentrations were 58–77% of the levels observed in the wild-type strain. These results suggested that the mutations in the vma-3 gene lowered the effective activity of the V-ATPase in vivo.Table IIIProperties of four bfr mutantsStrainMutationDoubling timeV-ATPase activityKi, BafKi, CCAhμmol/min/mgnmnm74ANone3.05.261.7bfr21F136L2.82.6801.1bfr33T32I3.52.64004.9bfr65Y143H4.32.81004.9bfr89Y143N3.53.51154.9The data are summarized from Table II, Figs. 4 and 5, and the text.

Vacuolar membranes from the four types of vma-3 mutant strains were assayed for V-ATPase activity and resistance to bafilomycin in vitro. Because the specific activity of vacuolar membranes can vary 2-fold in different preparations, it is difficult to compare rigorously the activity of different strains. In several experiments, the four bfr strains had 50–80% of the activity of the wild-type strain, and the data in Table III are typical. The effect of bafilomycin on the V-ATPase activity was significantly different in the bfr and wild-type strains (Fig.4). bfr21, bfr65, and bfr89 showed similar levels of resistance, requiring ∼13–20-fold higher concentrations of bafilomycin to inhibit 50% of V-ATPase activity. These three strains had mutations in the fourth membrane helix, near the putative proton binding residue, Glu-138. bfr33, mutated in the loop between helix 1 and 2, required ∼70-fold higher concentrations of bafilomycin to inhibit 50% of V-ATPase activity. As described below, the V-ATPase activity was fully sensitive to concanamycin. Because the structures of bafilomycin and concanamycin are very similar, we predicted that the V-ATPase of bfr strains would also be resistant to concanamycin A. To our surprise, the V-ATPase in bfr strains was not greatly altered in sensitivity to concanamycin. All of the strains were assayed at the same time in the same batch of solutions (Fig.5). The bfr21 strain showed essentially the same sensitivity to concanamycin A as the wild-type strain. bfr33, bfr65, and bfr89 were slightly resistant, requiring ∼3-fold higher concentrations of concanamycin to inhibit 50% of V-ATPase activity. The major structural difference between bafilomycin and concanamycin is in the macrolide ring. If the bfr strains discriminated between these two classes of antibiotics, then we predicted that V-ATPase of the bfr strains should be resistant to other forms of bafilomycin. We tested the effects of bafilomycin B1, C, and D, as shown in TableIV. The bfr strains were significantly resistant. The relative potency of the different bafilomycins was consistent with previous results (7Dröse S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K.

In this article, we report that the expression of eEF1A-2/S1 protein is activated upon myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, we show that upon serum deprivation-induced apoptosis, eEF1A-2/S1 protein disappears and is replaced by its homolog eEF1A-1/EF-1α in dying myotubes; cell death is characterized by the activation of caspase-3. In addition, we show that the continuous expression of eEF1A-2/S1 resulting from adenoviral gene transfer protects differentiated myotubes from apoptosis by delaying their death, thus suggesting a prosurvival function for eEF1A-2/S1 in skeletal muscle. In contrast, myotube death is accelerated by the introduction of the homologous gene, eEF1A-1/EF-1α, whereas cells transfected with antisense eEF1A-1/EF-1αare protected from apoptosis. These results demonstrate that the two sister genes, eEF1A-1/EF-1α and eEF1A-2/S1, regulate myotube survival with the former exerting prodeath activity and the latter a prosurvival effect.

Apoptosis is an active process enabling normal metazoan development and tissue homeostasis by permitting the deletion of unwanted or damaged cells (1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C.

In mammalian cells, the control of cell death or survival is governed by the interplay between the Bcl-2 family members and the activation of caspase proteases (for review, see Refs. 3Ashkenazi A.

Once activated, caspases can cleave several proteins to inactivate their functions, which are essential to survival. Upon differentiation induction of skeletal muscle cell lines, undifferentiated myoblasts are susceptible to apoptosis but become resistant as they differentiate into myotubes. It is suggested that this resistance may be dependent upon the induction of two repressors of cell cycle traverse: p21Cip1 and Rb (8Wang J. Walsh K.

Deletion of the promoter and first noncoding exon of the eEF1A-2/S1 gene is associated with thewasted mouse phenotype, characterized by muscle atrophy, neurological impairment, immunological deficiency, and death after fewer than 30 days postpartum (18Chambers D.M. Peters J. Abbott C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, absence of either form of eEF1A homologs is observed 3 weeks after birth inwasted mutant mice, thus impairing protein translation (11Khalyfa A. Bourbeau D. Chen E. Petroulakis E.

No mechanism has yet been identified to explain the switch in peptide eEF1As seen in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain during development. Furthermore, it remains unclear why eEF1A-2/S1 is only expressed in long lasting terminally differentiated cells such as neurons, cardiomyocytes, and myofibers. Because both elongation factors, eEF1A-1/EF-1α and eEF1A-2/S1, have similar canonical function in protein translation, we hypothesized that the developmental switch could be explained by the noncanonical functions of the proteins. eukaryotic elongation factor 1A Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin cytomegalovirus terminal nucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP nick end labeling Asp-Glu-Val-Asp peptide Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp peptide To unravel this mystery, we analyzed the protein expression and function of eEF1A-1/EF-1α and eEF1A-2/S1 in culture during both muscle differentiation and apoptotic cell death induced by serum deprivation in cultured differentiated myotubes. In this article, we report that differentiating L6 and C2C12 myoblast cultures express eEF1A-2/S1 protein at a late stage of myotube differentiation. Furthermore, we show that differentiated cultures die after serum withdrawal, an event associated with a decrease in eEF1A-2/S1 protein expression, an increase of eEF1A-1/EF-1α protein abundance, and the activation of caspase-3. Adenoviral transfer of theeEF1A-2/S1 gene or eEF1A-1/EF-1α antisense gene transfection rescues cultured myotubes from apoptotic cell death induction. These results suggest that differentiated myotubes can be induced to die via apoptosis, and the suicidal event can be either slowed down or accelerated by homologous peptide elongation factor eEF1A-2/S1 or eEF1A-1/EF-1α, respectively. This may illustrate one reason behind the peptide eEF1A developmental switch, so that all those long lived, terminally differentiated cells are protected from accidental induction of programmed cell death. The mouse-derived skeletal myoblast C2C12 cell line (American Type Culture Center, ATCC) and rat-derived cultured myoblast L6A line (a generous gift from Dr. Dan Goldman, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and kept at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 humidified atmosphere incubator. After confluent cultures were rinsed twice with serum-free DMEM, myoblast differentiation was induced by replacing the 10% fetal bovine serum-containing culture medium by DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum. The yield of myotubes achieved was visually estimated to be between 60 and 80%. For serum deprivation, myotubes were rinsed twice with serum-free DMEM to remove all trace of serum and then cultured after the third change in the same medium. Cultured C2C12 cells were harvested for analysis at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days of differentiation and at 3, 6, and 9 days of serum deprivation. Cultured L6 cells were collected daily after induction of either differentiation or apoptosis. Cultured C2C12 and L6 myotubes were processed in the same manner. The medium of serum-deprived cells was collected and added to the scraped cells to allow centrifugation of both adhering and floating cells. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mmEDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubated overnight at 56 °C. Afterward, samples were treated with 50 μg/ml RNase A for 2 h followed by a phenol/chloroform extraction. The DNA was precipitated using 0.3 m final concentration of sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and isopropyl alcohol. The DNA pellet was then rinsed with 75% cold ethanol and resuspended in water. After being spun for 20 min in a microcentrifuge, samples were loaded onto a 1.8% agarose and Tris-boric acid-EDTA buffer gel containing ethidium bromide to allow electrophoretic separation of the fragmented DNA. The separated fragments were visualized on the agarose gel using a UV transluminator, and profiles of oligonucleotides were taken with a digital camera. DNA fragmentation analysis of individual cell was performed by DNA nicked-end labeling using terminal-d-transferase, as described by Gavrieliet al. (23Gavrieli Y. Shennan Y. Ben-Sasson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9156) Google Scholar). Differentiated L6 myotubes were treated with trypsin and then grown on coverslips; one set was serum deprived 2 days after seeding. Differentiated cells were fixed using cold methanol/acetone (1:1) at −20 °C for 10 min. Fixed cells were rehydrated with PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then rinsed twice with double-distilled water. Afterward, coverslips were covered with terminal transferase reaction buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, 5 mm cobalt chloride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μm biotin-16-dUTP (Roche), and terminal transferase (Promega) at 0.3 unit/μl); the reaction was performed at 37 °C for 1 h in a humidified chamber and then terminated by transferring the coverslip samples to a TB buffer containing 300 mm sodium chloride and 30 mm sodium citrate for 15 min at room temperature. The specimens were then rinsed in double distilled water and incubated in 2% bovine serum albumin for 10 min. After the addition of serum albumin, the specimens were incubated with 20 μg/ml streptavidin and fluorescein isothiocyanate (Roche) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently washed twice in PBS along with 0.4 μg/ml propidium iodide in the second washing. The propidium iodide was removed by rinsing the samples twice in PBS. Coverslips were mounted in PBS containing 50% glycerol and examined with a Nikon fluorescence microscope. Myotubes cultures were rinsed with PBS and then gently scraped into 1 ml of PBS. Collected cells were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 3 min. The pellets were resuspended into RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA) containing fresh protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml of both leupeptin and pepstatin). Afterward, cell extracts were sonicated for 1 min to break cell membranes; proteins were quantified by a modified Bradford method, using the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions, and compared with a γ-globulin standard curve. Equal amounts of total protein for each sample were separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by the standard transfer method. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.25% Tween 20 and 5% fat-free powdered milk. Before incubation with primary antibodies, membranes were rinsed in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 solution. Primary antibodies used were HT7 for eEF1A-1/EF-1α, CB5 for eEF1A-2/S1 (22Khalyfa A. Carlson B.M. Carlson J.A. Wang E. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 216: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), MF-20 monoclonal antibody for myosin heavy chain (24Gambke B. Rubinstein N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12092-12100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (the clone was a generous gift from Dr. L. Chalifour, Lady Davis Institute, Montreal, Canada); Caspase-3 (H-277) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (H-250) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz, and monoclonal β-actin antibody from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. After incubation overnight at 4 °C or 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were washed four times, 10 min each, in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20. Blots were subjected to a second hybridization with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Cappel) or goat anti-mouse antibodies (Cappel) and then washed five times with Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20. Bands were detected using a chemiluminescent ECL procedure, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For β-actin detection, previously used membranes were soaked in stripping buffer (70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) at 60 °C for 30 min and hybridized following the procedures described above. Films were quantified by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics) and expressed as the ratio to the maximal level of detection. Viability tests were performed using the trypan blue exclusion assay, as described by Duttaroy et al. (25Duttaroy A. Qian J.F. Smith J.S. Wang E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Viability percentages were calculated by dividing the number of dead blue cells by the total cell number. Each experiment was repeated three times. A cell-permeable, irreversible peptide inhibitor of caspase-3, DEVD-FMK (Calbiochem), was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 75 μm. The culture medium was changed every day, with the addition of fresh inhibitor-containing medium, and control cells were plated with the same concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide without inhibitor. Cell viability was measured as described above. Serum-deprived and control cell cultures were rinsed once in cold PBS and then collected in cold PBS by scraping the cells off the plate. After centrifugation and removal of PBS, cell pellets were kept at −80 °C until caspase assays were performed. The frozen pellets were resuspended in caspase lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% CHAPS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). Freeze-thaw cell lysis cycles were performed by alternatively transferring the samples from an ethanol/dry ice bath to a 37 °C water bath five times. The supernatant was collected after 20 min of centrifugation at full speed (≅ 12,000 rpm) in a cold microcentrifuge. Assays were performed in caspase buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 5 mm dithiothreitol, final concentration), to which 50 μm final concentration of substrate and 5 μl of protein extract were added to yield a final volume of 100 μl. Caspase-3 DEVD-AFC and caspase-1 YVAD-AFC peptide substrates (Biomol) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. The assays were performed in black wall, clear bottom plates using a Bio-Rad fluorometer and read at 598 nm after excitation at 390 nm wavelengths. The results were compared against an AFC curve generated during the reaction. To measure specific activity, proteins were quantified according to the method described above. Recombinant adenovirus expressing eEF1A-2/S1 was prepared with ADENO-QUEST (Quantum Biotechnologies, Montreal). MouseeEF1A-2/S1 cDNA (26Lee S. Ann D.K. Wang E. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pQBI-AdCMV5 transfer vector. Cotransfection of QBI-293A cells with viral DNA and the transfer vector was performed by the precipitated calcium phosphate procedure, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plaques were picked up and amplified in QBI-293A cells. Screening for positive recombinants was performed by Western blotting using CB5 antibody, which specifically recognizes eEF1A-2/S1 protein (22Khalyfa A. Carlson B.M. Carlson J.A. Wang E. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 216: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Among the positive clones, one named A5.4 was used to generate the experimental virus. Control virus for mock infection was generated by transfection of QBI-293A cells with nondigested viral DNA. The β-galactosidase gene was already included in the viral DNA by the manufacturer; insertion of a new gene into the vector does not affect its transcription and thus can be used as a marker of infection. After amplification, cells were broken by freeze/thaw cycles; and after centrifugation, the supernatant culture media containing viruses were kept frozen. Virus titration was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. Growing cultures of L6 cells were infected with mock or recombinant adenovirus supernatant diluted to 200 multiplicity of infection, enough to cover the cell monolayer at 37 °C for 1.5 h. After incubation, the medium was changed to fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Infection efficiency was measured after 2 days and again after 6 days (corresponding to 4 days of differentiation) by β-galactosidase assay, using the following protocol. Cells were fixed for 10 min with 0.2% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde in PBS and then washed three times for 10 min with PBS. Afterward, an enzymatic reaction was performed in β-galactosidase buffer (5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 2 mmMgCl2 in PBS) with 1 mm5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as substrate. After 3–5 h at 37 °C, β-galactosidase-positive blue cells were counted, and the results were expressed as percentage of the total number of cells. Cultured L6 myoblasts were grown and differentiated in six-well plates, as described above. After 3 days of differentiation, cells were cotransfected with 5 μg of constitutively expressing Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase vector, along with 10 μg of pBK CMV-eEF1A-1/EF-1α sense or antisense (full-length), or empty pBK CMV vector used as a control (19Chen E. Proestou G. Bourbeau D. Wang E. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Duttaroy A. Bourbeau D. Wang X.L. Wang E. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), with the exception that the cells were not subcultured the previous day. Efficiency of transfection was assessed by β-galactosidase staining, which revealed that myotubes were transfected. Cells were serum deprived 24 h after transfection and collected on a daily basis as described previously into cold PBS. After centrifugation, pellets were kept frozen at −80 °C until protein extraction was performed. For the extraction, the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and then submitted to three freeze-thaw cycles by transferring the samples between an ethanol-dry ice bath and a 37 °C water bath. Afterward, the extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 8 min in a refrigerated bench top centrifuge, and the supernatants were retained for the assay. Viability was quantified by measuring β-galactosidase activity, as described by Chen et al. (19Chen E. Proestou G. Bourbeau D. Wang E. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and Oral et al.(27Oral H.B. Arancibia-Carcamo C.V. Haskard D.O. George A.J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The activity was assessed in 300 μl of reaction solution containing 3.33 μl of 100 × magnesium buffer (0.1 mMgCl2, 4.5 m β-mercaptoethanol), 66 μl of 4 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, 230.67 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (41 ml of 0.2 m Na2HPO4, 9 ml of 0.2m NaH2PO4, and 50 ml of water), to which 20 μl of protein extract was added. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C in a water bath, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 500 μl of 1 m Na2CO3, and the optical density of the samples was measured by spectrophotometry at 420 nm. Blanks were generated at the same time, and proteins from a positive sample were added after reaction termination with sodium carbonate. Efficiency of transfection was determined by β-galactosidase staining of the cells, as described above. For Western blotting, cells were selected with 250 μg/ml of Geneticin for 4 days before collection. To initiate our study on the functions of eEF1A-1/EF-1α and eEF1A-2/S1, mouse C2C12 and rat L6 myoblasts were first cultured to confluence and then induced to differentiate into multinucleated myotubes by changing the culture medium from a high (10% fetal bovine serum) to a low (2% horse serum) serum concentration; both cell lines gave rise to large myotubes upon differentiation. After 4 days of differentiation for L6 cells, and 6 days for C2C12, myotube cultures were switched from medium containing 2% horse serum to serum-free medium, to induce apoptotic cell death in differentiated myotubes by serum deprivation. Protein samples of L6 and C2C12 cultures were collected at different time points during differentiation and processed for Western blotting with specific antibodies against eEF1A-2/S1, eEF1A-1/EF-1α, and myosin heavy chain, used as a marker of differentiation. After 3 days of differentiation, L6 cells start expressing both eEF1A-2/S1 protein and the differentiation marker myosin heavy chain (Fig.1 A), whereas eEF1A-1/EF-1α protein decreases to around 20% of its initial expression after differentiation. In C2C12 cultures, eEF1A-2/S1 and myosin heavy chain also appear after 3 days of differentiation (Fig. 1 B), accompanied by a 3-day gradual loss in protein level of eEF1A-1/EF-1α, which later remains stable at a low level in C2C12 myotube cultures. The kinetic of eEF1A-2/S1 protein appearance correlates with myosin heavy chain, a late marker of differentiation, suggesting that eEF1A-2/S1 is a protein that appears late in the differentiation process. When C2C12 and L6 myotubes are serum deprived to induce apoptosis, eEF1A-1/EF-1α and eEF1A-2/S1 expression patterns are reversed from that seen during differentiation. In cultured L6 myotubes, eEF1A-2/S1 protein disappears after 2 days of serum deprivation, whereas eEF1A-1/EF-1α protein level increases simultaneously, to almost double the level seen in control myotubes (Fig.2 A). A similar pattern is observed in cultured C2C12 myotubes; eEF1A-1/EF-1α protein expression level remains low for the first 3 days of serum deprivation but then increases and reaches a higher protein expression level than in the differentiated state (Fig. 2 B). Unlike eEF1A-1/EF-1α, eEF1A-2/S1 protein disappears after 9 days of serum deprivation. Myosin heavy chain was used to confirm that cells were differentiated during the serum deprivation experiment; β-actin was used as a loading control. Cell viability of serum-deprived C2C12 and L6 myotubes was measured using the trypan blue exclusion assay, where blue cells are counted as dead. As seen in Fig.3 A, only 15% of C2C12 myotube cultures remain alive after 8 days of serum deprivation, whereas more than 60% of the control cells cultured with 2% horse serum remain viable at the same time point. In L6 myotube cultures, less than 10% of serum-deprived cells survive past 3 days, whereas about 40% of the control cells survive. To characterize myotube death further, DNA fragmentation assays were performed. As shown in Fig. 3 B, oligonucleosome fragments appeared in C2C12 myotube cultures after 3 days of serum deprivation and increased steadily up to 9 days of serum deprivation, whereas control myotube cultures do not display any detectable DNA fragmentation. The earliest dying L6 cells start to show fragmented DNA after 2 days of serum deprivation. Thus, serum deprivation induces apoptotic cell death in differentiated cultures of myotube. TUNEL staining was performed to confirm apoptosis as the mechanism for cell death (Fig. 4). Theleft part of the composite panel (Fig. 4,A, C, and E) represents the control differentiated myotube cultures maintained in DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum; the right part (Fig. 4, B,D, and F) represents serum-deprived cultured myotubes. Bright TUNEL-positive stained nuclei, a hallmark of apoptosis, are observed in serum-deprived myotube cultures as indicated by full arrows in Fig. 4 F, whereas the control counterpart remains negative for TUNEL staining (Fig. 4 E,open arrows). Propidium iodide staining was used as a counterstain for all nuclei (Fig. 4, C and D), and phase contrast pictures (Fig. 4, A and B) reveal that the cells were indeed differentiated myotube syncytia.Figure 4Detection of apoptotic myotubes by TUNEL staining. Differentiated L6 myotube cultures were grown on coverslips and then serum deprived to induce apoptosis. Control cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum during the duration of the experiment (panels A, C, andE). After 3 days of serum deprivation, L6 myotube cultures were processed for TUNEL staining (panels B, D, and F). Phase contrast pictures show control (panel A) and apoptotic (panel B) myotubes. Propidium iodide was used as a counterstain to reveal the presence of multinucleated myofibers (panels C and D). TUNEL staining revealed the absence of positive apoptotic myonuclei in the control myotube (panel E) and bright, condensed positive myonuclei in apoptotic myotube (panel F). Open arrowsindicate the presence of nonapoptotic nuclei (panels C andE), and full arrows indicate the presence of apoptotic nuclei (panels D and F). All pictures were taken at the same magnification (×400).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have assessed the apoptotic biochemical program by measuring caspase-3 activity with the cleavage of DEVD-AFC fluorescent peptide substrate. High caspase-3 activity is observed after 2 days of serum deprivation, whereas the activity in control cells remains close to the base-line level for the same period of time (Fig. 5 A). As expected for caspase-mediated cell death, caspase-3 activity is seen when the cells are dying as shown by the kinetic of viability measurements (Fig. 5 C). Caspase-1 fluorescent YVAD-AFC peptide was used as a negative control; caspase-1 activity remains constant in both serum-deprived and control myotube cultures. To verify that caspase-3 activity indeed occurs in apoptotic myotube cultures, proteins from control and serum-deprived cells were processed for Western blotting with caspase-3 and PARP rabbit polyclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the p17 catalytic fragment of active caspase-3 protein, obtained after activation by cleavage of p32 zymogen form of caspase-3, is seen on the Western blot at both 2 and 3 days of serum deprivation. These time points correspond to the peak of activity level in caspase-3 fluorogenic peptide cleavage assays (Fig. 5 A). During the same period of time, a p85-cleaved PARP fragment, a marker of cellular caspase-3 protein activity (28Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G.

Here we report on the biochemical and functional differences between ubiquitin and UBB+1 and the effect of the mutant protein on neuronal cells. UBB+1 lacks the capacity to ubiquitinate, and although it is ubiquitinated itself, UBB+1 is not degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasomal system and is quite stable in neuronal cells. Overexpression of UBB+1 in neuroblastoma cells significantly induces nuclear fragmentation and cell death.

Recent evidence suggests that PBP is involved not only in the activation of nuclear receptors but also in the activation of other groups of transcription factors. One such example is a PBP-containing cofactor complex cofactor required for Sp1 that was purified from HeLa cells and found to be required for transcriptional activation by Sp1 in association with the RNA polymerase II apparatus (11Ryu S. Zhou S. Ladurner A.G. Tjian R. Nature. 1999; 397: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We and others (12Zhu Y. Qi C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol.

The PBP null placenta failed to become adequately vascularized, similar to the placenta of PPARγ-deficient embryos (12Zhu Y. Qi C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14779-14782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), supporting the requirement of PBP for PPARγ functions in vivo. We now report that PBP null embryos exhibit a diverse group of developmental defects involving the heart, eye, megakaryocytes, erythrocytes, and vasculature. Some of these findings involve PPARγ or retinoid-sensitive tissues; however, several cell-specific abnormalities have not been attributed to the PPAR-signaling pathway, suggesting PBP may interact with additional transcription factors. We now report that PBP null embryos exhibit phenotypic overlap in four organ systems with embryos deficient in various members of the GATA family of zinc finger transcription factors. Here, we further demonstrate that PBP interacts with GATA-1, GATA-2, GATA-3, GATA-4, and GATA-6, the members of the zinc finger-containing GATA family of multifunctional transcription factors. The GATA family of transcription factors controls the development and differentiation of a wide spectrum of cell lineages including cardiac muscle, megakaryocytes, placental trophoblasts, adipocytes, and T-lymphocytes (15Pandolfi P.P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37178-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) have prompted speculation that GATA factors may participate in multiprotein-DNA complexes. The similarities in the phenotype of certain organs of PBP null embryos with embryos deficient in various members of the GATA family along with the dependence of hematopoietic differentiation on GATA-1 (21Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.F. D'Agati V. Orkin S.H. Constantini F.

We found that PBP is capable of binding all five GATA factors analyzed, GATA-1, GATA-2, GATA-3, GATA-4, and GATA-6, and that the binding of mouse and chicken GATA-1 and mouse GATA-4 and GATA-6 was independent of the conserved nuclear receptor-interacting sequence motif LXXLL (where L is leucine and X is any amino acid) (9Qi C.

When PBP was coexpressed with GATA-3, an augmentation of GATA-dependent transcriptional activity was observed. These observations, taken together with the phenotypic overlap of PBP null embryos with mice deficient in PPARγ, retinoid X receptor, and the GATA family strongly suggest that PBP acts as a pivotal coactivator in orchestrating the complex array of transcriptional signals required for normal embryonic development. A generation of mutant mice carrying disrupted PBP gene was performed as described previously (12Zhu Y. Qi C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14779-14782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Embryos from heterozygous intercross were collected at gestational day 11.5, and the DNA from the amnion was used for genotyping by PCR using primers 5′-CCTTCTTTCTCCGCAGTCAC-3′ and 5′AGTGATGAGTTCATACAGGGG-3′ to detect the wild type allele and primers 5′-CCACAGTCGATGAATCCAGAA-3′ and 5′-TGAATGAACTGCAGGACGAGG-3′ to detect the targeted allele. Twenty-two embryos (wild type, n = 11; null embryos,n = 11) were used for gross and microscopic examination. Age-matched (E11.5) wild type (n = 11) and PBP null embryos (n = 11) were fixed in paraformaldehyde or 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, serially sectioned at 5 μm thickness in sagittal or transverse planes, and stained with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffarin. Sections of normally developed wild type murine eyes (n = 4) and bone marrow (n= 3) were used to compare localization of PBP at different stages of development. Immunohistochemical stains were performed using a standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex protocol as described previously (32Dawson D.W. Volpert O. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar) and an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against PBP (12Zhu Y. Qi C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S.

The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and reviewed in a blinded fashion. Positivity was denoted by a brown color and its intensity graded as 1+ (low) to 3+ (strong). The specificity of the antibody was confirmed previously with in vitro translated full-length PBP protein and Western blotting with the nuclear extract prepared from HeLa cells (12Zhu Y. Qi C. Jia Y.

GST-cGATA-1, GST-cGATA-2, and GST-cGATA-3 are chicken GATA proteins that were expressed as GST fusion proteins by the bacteria using the expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). GST-mGATA-1, GST-mGATA-3, GST-mGATA-1 N-terminal zinc finger, and GST-mGATA C-terminal zinc finger) are mouse GATA proteins expressed as GST fusion proteins. The GST and GST-GATA fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the instructions by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The35S-labeled full-length PBP was produced by in vitro translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). pCMV-PBP used in the in vitro translation was as described previously (1Zhu Y. Qi C.

To determine the PBP region(s) interacting with cGATA-1 or mGATA-1, truncated PBP was generated from T7promoter-linked PBP cDNA fragments by in vitrotranslation. In the GST pull-down assay, GST-fusion protein from 10 ml of bacteria culture bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with 10 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled PBP protein for 2 h in 500 μl of NETN (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.7 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride). Beads were washed three times with binding buffer, and bound protein eluted by boiling for 2 min in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography. To assess the interaction of mGATA-4 and mGATA-6 with PBP, 35S-labeled in vitrotranslated full-length mGATA-4 and mGATA-6 were used in GST pull-down assays with GST-PBP-truncated fusion proteins. Mammalian expression vectors expressing cGATA proteins were constructed with TFAneo backbone (27Yamamoto M. Ko L.J. Leonard M.W. Beug H. Orkin S.H. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1650-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), and the transcription was directed by Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat promoter and enhancer. C3β-hGH reporter construct contains the rabbit β-globin TATA box and three copies of the CβE oligonucleotide in plasmid p0GH (27Yamamoto M. Ko L.J. Leonard M.W. Beug H. Orkin S.H. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1650-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). QT6 (immortal quail fibroblasts) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum, 2% chicken serum, and 2% tryptose phosphate broth, and NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum. Cells plated in six-well plates were transfected 24 h later with hGH reporter (0.25 μg), the appropriate expression plasmid DNAs (0.5 μg), GATA and PBP, and 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector pCMVβ (CLONTECH) DNA using CaPO4 transfection methods (CLONTECH) according to manufacturer instructions. Transfection without pCMV-PBP was compensated by adding the same amount of pCDNA3.1. After 24 h, the medium containing secreted hGH was collected and assayed by radioimmunoassay using the Allegro hGH system from Nichols Institute Diagnostics. The cell extracts were used to assay β-galactosidase activity (Tropix). To determine the expression pattern of PBP, immunohistochemical studies were performed on adult murine tissues using an anti-PBP antibody (12Zhu Y. Qi C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14779-14782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Overall, the cellular distribution of PBP closely paralleled the sites of morphological disturbances in the null embryos. Sections of the eye showed strong (3+) staining of the retinal pigment epithelial cells (Fig.1a, arrows), the corneal epithelial and endothelial cell layers (see Fig. 1b), lens epithelium, vascular endothelial cells, and the retinal ganglion cell layer (Fig. 1c, arrow). A well defined band of positivity was observed within the interphotoreceptor region of the retina (Fig.1c, arrowhead). To assess whether the neural retina was only nerve-related tissue expressing PBP, sections from the murine brain and spinal cord were stained. Intense staining (3+) was noted in cerebellar granule cells, vascular endothelial cells, and selective cells of the spinal ganglia (Fig. 1d, arrowhead) and its adjacent nerve (Fig. 1d, arrow). Loss of PBP affected two other major organ systems, the heart and the hematopoietic system. Sections of the heart showed strong (3+) immunolocalization to the myocardial cells (see myocardium adjacent to ventricle in Fig. 1e), endothelial cell nuclei within the endocardium, and the endocardial cushion near the ventricular outflow tract (see OT, Fig. 1e). When sections of bone marrow were examined, the population of megakaryocytes consistently demonstrated cytoplasmic and nuclear positivity for PBP (seearrows in Fig. 1f), whereas focal staining was evident in erythroid elements. These observations reveal that PBP immunolocalizes to a wide spectrum of organ systems, many of which are targets for pathological complications in PPARγ-dependent disease processes (14Barak Y.

Early embryonic demise at E11.5 in PBP null embryos is attributed to severe cardiac failure because of underlying maldevelopment of the heart (12Zhu Y. Qi C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14779-14782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Ito M. Yuan C-X. Okano H.J. Darnell R.B. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In all embryos, there was a large pericardial effusion associated with a dilated, blood-filled ventricle (Fig.2a, arrow). Histologically, the heart of the null embryos demonstrated noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium and trabecular hypoplasia resulting in a thin ventricular wall. Unlike the thickened ventricle of the wild type embryos, the ventricular myocardium of PBP−/− embryos failed to stratify into the multilayer structure that is required to sustain adequate cardiac function (Fig. 2, compare c withd). The interface between the endocardial endothelial cells and myocardium appeared to be the region where striking differences are evident between controls and null embryos. The heart endothelium (endocardium) is a key regulator of myocardial growth. It provides signals to facilitate the endothelial-mesenchymal transformation that is a prerequisite for normal ventricular development (33Fishman M.C. Olson E.N. Cell. 1997; 91: 53-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the control hearts, the endocardium made direct contact with the stratified myocardial cells, whereas in all of the PBP−/− embryos, the endothelial cells separated from the underlying pyknotic-appearing myocardial cells (Fig. 2f, arrows). Similar contact gaps exist at the interface of the endocardium and myocardium in other lines of mice with hypoplastic ventricles including those deficient in PPARγ, retinoid X receptor α, or GATA-3 (14Barak Y.

Taken together, these data suggest that impaired signaling at the endocardial-myocardial junction may account for the loss of myocytes contributing to ventricular hypoplasia. Maintaining a delicate balance of angiogenic mediators is important in the placenta during the early phases of development (36Breier G. Placenta. 2000; 21: S11-S15Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar,37Smith S.K. He Y. Clark D.E. Charnock-Jones D.S. Semin. Perinatol. 2000; 24: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cells of trophoblast lineage are especially important, because they secrete several potent angiogenic factors and must interact with both mesenchymal and vascular components to permit the placenta to function as a rich blood source for the growing fetus (37Smith S.K. He Y. Clark D.E. Charnock-Jones D.S. Semin. Perinatol. 2000; 24: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 38Cross J.C. Semin. Cell Dev.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5592-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and differentiating trophoblasts are influenced by PPARγ (39Schaiff W.T. Carlson M.G. Smith S.D. Levy R. Nelson D.M. Sadovsky Y. J. Clin.

We previously noted that the E11.5 PBP null placentas were histologically different from the wild type controls (12Zhu Y. Qi C. Jia Y. Nye J.S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol.

Unlike the controls, the PBP−/− placentas lacked a complex capillary network and exhibited marked erythrophagocytic activity within the trophoblasts (Fig.3, compare a withb). Given the critical role of the trophoblast in secreting pro-angiogenic mediators, it is plausible that dysfunctional trophoblasts create an imbalance in placental angiogenesis. The placental disturbances in angiogenesis appeared quite distinct from those that occurred within the PBP null embryo itself in which vessels were in excess. Grossly, all null embryos could be recognized by a generalized hyperemic appearance (Fig. 3d). This feature was in contrast to the more uniformly tanned appearance of the wild type controls (Fig. 3c). Microscopically, the hyperemia corresponded to a marked increase in vascularization (not illustrated), especially notable along the paraspinal region (Fig.3d, arrows) within the developing brain and the retina. In some instances, vascular permeability appeared impaired with extravazation of red blood cells into adjacent tissue. These data suggest that PBP may function as a negative regulator of endothelial cell proliferation possibly through a loss of PPARγ regulation of angioinhibitory activity (41Xin X. Yang S.

https://openalex.org/W1996527248,"The key elements of circadian clockwork and oxygen homeostasis are the PAS protein family members PER and CLOCK and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha). The PAS domain serves as an interface for protein-protein interactions. We asked whether a cross-talk exists between the PAS components of hypoxic and circadian pathways. We found several isoforms of PER1 protein that exhibit tissue-specific size differences. In the mouse brain, a predominantly nuclear 48 kDa isoform that followed a daily rhythm was observed. The 48 kDa form was found in the nuclear fractions derived from mouse liver, Swiss3T3 fibroblasts, and N2A neuroblastoma cells. In mouse kidney and human 293 kidney cells, a 55 kDa PER1 form was detected. CLOCK was observed as a predicted 100 kDa protein in rat-1 cells and in all analyzed mouse tissues including brain, liver, kidney, and spleen. In contrast to PER1, CLOCK protein expression was not rhythmic. Exposure to hypoxia led to increased PER1 and CLOCK protein levels in mice. Based on coimmunoprecipitation experiments that showed protein-protein interaction between PER1 and the alpha subunit of HIF-1, we suggest that these hypoxic effects may be modulated by HIF-1alpha.-Chilov, D., Hofer, T., Bauer, C., Wenger, R.

SAG exerted significantly higher stimulatory effects than SDG and SEG on activation of PKC alpha and PKC delta. Activation of PKC beta I by SEG and SDG was higher than that by SAG. Activation of PKC gamma did not differ significantly among DAG molecular species. Addition of SAG to assays containing SEG and SDG exerted additive effects on activation of alpha and epsilon, but not on beta I and gamma, isoforms of PKC. SDG- and SEG-induced activation of PKC delta was significantly curtailed by the addition of SAG. Three DAG species significantly curtailed the PMA-induced activation of beta Iota, gamma, and delta, but not of alpha and epsilon, isoforms of PKC. Our study demonstrates for the first time that in vitro activation of different PKC isoenzymes vary in response to different DAG species, and one can envisage that this differential regulation may be responsible for their in vivo effects on target organs."
https://openalex.org/W2061997406,"Glutathione S-transferase (GST) functions in xenobiotic biotransformation and drug metabolism. Increased expression of GSTpi, an isozyme of GST, has been found in cancer cells resistant to doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP), and this increase was believed to be correlated with drug resistance of cancer cells. GST is mainly expressed in the cytoplasm; GSTpi in the nucleus has been reported in cancer cells, but the meaning of this result is not known. Here, we studied changes in the amount of nuclear GSTpi after exposure of cancer cells to anticancer drugs, and role of the nuclear GSTpi in drug resistance. We found nuclear GSTpi in cancer cells resistant to DOX, and the amount of nuclear GSTpi was enhanced by treatment of the cancer cells with DOX or CDDP. We also found that a mushroom lectin, an inhibitor of nuclear transport, inhibited the nuclear transfer of GSTpi, suggesting the existence of a specific transport system for the nuclear transfer of GSTpi. Nuclear GSTpi protected DNA against damage by anticancer drugs. These results suggest a possible role of GSTpi in the acquisition of resistance to anticancer drugs by cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2157099701,"We have employed a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and covalent cross-linking to identify subunits in close proximity to subunit B in the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. Unique cysteine residues were introduced into a Cys-less form of subunit B, and the V-ATPase complex in isolated vacuolar membranes from each mutant strain was reacted with the bifunctional, photoactivable maleimide reagent 4-(N-maleimido)benzophenone. Photoactivation resulted in cross-linking of the unique sulfhydryl groups on subunit B with other subunits in the complex. Four of the eight mutants constructed containing a unique cysteine residue at Ala15, Lys45, Glu494, or Thr501 resulted in the formation of cross-linked products, which were recognized by Western blot analysis using antibodies against both subunits B and E. These products had a molecular mass of 84 kDa, consistent with a cross-linked product of subunits B and E. Molecular modeling of subunit B places Ala15 and Lys45 near the top of the V1 structure (i.e. farthest from the membrane), whereas Glu494 and Thr501 are predicted to reside near the bottom of V1, with all four residues predicted to be oriented toward the external surface of the complex. A model incorporating these and previous data is presented in which subunit E exists in an extended conformation on the outer surface of the A3B3 hexamer that forms the core of the V1 domain.

In the rotary mechanism, ATP hydrolysis within the α3β3 head of the F1domain drives rotation of a central γ subunit (31Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the V1 and V0 domains have been shown to be connected by both a central and a peripheral stalk (38Boekema E.J. Ubbink-Kok T.

Although no subunits in the V-ATPase complex show homology to the γ subunit of F1, two subunits (D and E) are predicted from sequence analysis to have a similarly high α-helical content (40Nelson H.

Forgac M. J. Biol.

Nakamoto R.K. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20835-20839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such mutations do not conclusively show that subunit D is the γ subunit homolog, however, because mutations altering the coupling efficiency of the F-ATPase have also been identified in the δ subunit of F1 (44Hazard A.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 427-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, subunit b, which forms part of the peripheral stalk of the F-ATPases (26Ogilvie I. Aggeler R.

In addition, differential protease sensitivity and release by chaotropic agents have been used in support of a model in which subunit E, rather than subunit D, functions as the central rotor (47Grüber G.

To begin to address which subunits in the V-ATPase complex form part of the central stalk and which form part of the peripheral stalk, we have employed a combination of site-directed mutagenesis of subunit B to introduce unique cysteine residues and chemical cross-linking using a photoactivable sulfhydryl reagent. A molecular model for subunit B was constructed based upon sequence homology between the B and α subunits, the available x-ray coordinates of the α subunit (22Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R.

We have identified four cysteine residues predicted to be oriented toward the outer surface of V1that give rise to photoactivated cross-linking with subunit E upon covalent modification using a bifunctional maleimide reagent. These results suggest that subunit E is located on the outer surface of the V1 complex rather than in the interior of the A3B3 hexamer and is therefore a likely candidate to function as part of the peripheral stator connecting the V1 and V0 domains.

Vacuolar membranes were prepared from the vma2Δ strain expressing the wild-type VMA2 gene in pRS316, the pRS316 vector alone, the mutant VMA2 gene encoding the Cys-less form of subunit B (C188S) in pRS316, or the single cysteine-containing double mutants ofVMA2 containing the C188S mutation and the mutations described above in pRS316. Vacuolar membranes (50 μg of protein) were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.2) and suspended in 100 μl of the same buffer containing 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. MBP was dissolved in dimethylformamide at 100 mm, and 1 μl of the MBP solution was added to give a final concentration of 1 mm. For negative controls (i.e. −MBP), 1 μl of dimethylformamide was added instead. After incubation in the dark for 30 min at 23 °C, the unreacted MBP was quenched by addition of 10 mmdithiothreitol. Vacuolar membranes were precipitated by centrifugation and irradiated with a long-wavelength ultraviolet lamp for 5 min at 4 °C. For analysis of cross-linked products, proteins (15 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% acrylamide gels according to the method of Laemmli (51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the samples were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 4 h at 100 V. The blots were then cut into strips and analyzed by Western blotting using a mouse monoclonal antibody against Vma2p (subunit B) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Vma4p (subunit E) as previously described (52Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A model for the A3B3 hexamer of the V1 domain was created from the x-ray crystal structure of bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase (22Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar) as previously described (50Vasilyeva E. Liu Q. MacLeod K.J. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Alignment of the amino acid sequences was carried out using the Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis software package, and energy minimization was performed using X-PLOR. ATPase activity was measured using a coupled spectrometric assay as previously described (50Vasilyeva E. Liu Q. MacLeod K.J. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent proton transport was measured by fluorescence quenching using the probe 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine as described previously (50Vasilyeva E. Liu Q. MacLeod K.J. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer. Activities were measured in the absence or presence of 1 μm concanamycin A, a specific inhibitor of the V-ATPase (53Drose S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (54Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The approach employed to distinguish between V-ATPase subunits located on the periphery of the V1 domain and subunits located in the interior of the complex was site-directed introduction of cysteine residues, followed by photoactivated cross-linking. Subunit B was selected for introduction of unique cysteine residues for several reasons. First, we had previously constructed a Cys-less form of subunit B by replacing the single endogenous cysteine residue at position 188 with serine and had shown that the V-ATPase complex containing the C188S form of the B subunit had >90% of the wild-type levels of ATPase activity and proton transport (50Vasilyeva E. Liu Q. MacLeod K.J. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Second, a molecular model of subunit B had been constructed based upon sequence homology between subunit B and the α subunit of F1, the available x-ray coordinates of the bovine mitochondrial F1 domain (22Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar), and energy minimization (50Vasilyeva E. Liu Q. MacLeod K.J. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This model had been shown to accurately predict five of the six residues identified to be at the non-catalytic nucleotide-binding site on subunit B based upon nucleotide-protectable labeling of unique subunit B cysteine residues by biotin-maleimide (50Vasilyeva E. Liu Q. MacLeod K.J. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, it was felt that this model could be used with some confidence in the selection of sites predicted to be oriented toward the interior or exterior of the complex. Fig. 1 shows the molecular model of subunit B and the location of seven of the eight sites at which unique cysteine residues were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of theVMA2 gene. The molecule is oriented such that the top is located farthest from the membrane. In Fig. 1a, residues predicted to be located on the outer surface of V1(including Lys45, Thr270, Asp199, Glu494, and Thr501) are shown on the right, whereas those predicted to be facing the interior of the A3B3 hexamer (Asp341 and Lys417) are on the left. In Fig. 1b, the molecule is rotated 90° such that the residues predicted to be facing the outer surface of V1 are coming out of the figure. Ala15 is not shown because the available x-ray coordinates of the F1 α subunit do not extend to this position; however, it is likely to be located near the top of the molecule. The mutant VMA2 genes were subcloned into the yeast shuttle vector pRS316 and expressed in a vma2Δ strain in which the VMA2 gene was deleted. Thus, in each double mutant, Cys188 has been converted to a serine residue, and a unique cysteine has been introduced at the indicated position. To determine the effects of the mutations on the stability of subunit B and the assembly of the V-ATPase complex, Western blot analysis was performed on vacuoles isolated from the vma2Δ strain transformed with the wild-type VMA2 gene, each of the mutant forms, or the pRS316 vector alone. It has previously been shown that disruption of V-ATPase assembly by loss of any of the V-ATPase subunits results in decreased levels of V1 subunits present on isolated vacuolar membranes (55Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, both the C188S mutant and each of the double mutants containing unique cysteine residues showed wild-type levels of subunit B on the vacuolar membrane, indicating that mutant proteins were stably expressed and competent for assembly with the remainder of the V-ATPase complex. To determine the effects of the subunit B mutations on V-ATPase complex activity, concanamycin A-sensitive proton transport and ATPase activities were measured on isolated vacuoles using 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine quenching and a continuous spectrophotometric assay, respectively. As shown in Fig.3, vacuoles isolated from the C188S mutant had >90% of the wild-type levels of both proton transport and ATPase activities, consistent with our previous results (50Vasilyeva E. Liu Q. MacLeod K.J. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, each of the double mutants containing unique subunit B cysteine residues had >40% of the wild-type activity. This is consistent with the ability of each of these mutant strains to grow on plates buffered to both pH 5.5 and 7.5 (data not shown), as previously reported for strains expressing wild-type V-ATPase (56Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To determine the V-ATPase subunits in proximity to the cysteine residues introduced into subunit B, photoactivated cross-linking was carried out using the photoreactive sulfhydryl reagent MBP (52Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 57Dormán G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). This reagent is capable of reacting with the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues via the maleimide moiety and, upon ultraviolet irradiation, generating a reactive species capable of insertion into nearby bonds. The linker arm connecting the two reactive species is ∼10 Å in length (57Dormán G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). To determine whether MBP was capable of cross-linking subunit B to other subunits in the V-ATPase complex as a result of reaction with sulfhydryl groups on other subunits, vacuoles isolated from a strain expressing the C188S mutant of subunit B were reacted with MBP in the dark, followed by irradiation with ultraviolet light. The proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel and probed by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody against Vma2p. As shown in Fig. 4a, no higher molecular mass species containing subunit B were observed upon reaction of the V-ATPase containing the C188S mutant with MBP, suggesting that although the V-ATPase likely contains other cysteine residues capable of reacting with MBP, these do not lead to cross-linking of subunit B with other V-ATPase subunits. Thus, any cross-linked products containing"

We now report that the Ca2+-activated K+ channel mIKCa1 modulates mouse Paneth cell secretion. mIKCa1 cDNA clones identified in a mouse small intestinal crypt library by hybridization to human IKCa1 cDNA probes were isolated, and DNA sequence analysis showed that they were identical to mIKCa1 cDNAs isolated from erythroid cells and liver. The genomic organization was found to be conserved between mouse and human IKCa1 as shown by comparisons of the respective cDNA and genomic sequences. Reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments using nested primers amplified mIKCa1 from the lower half of bisected crypts and from single Paneth cells, but not from the upper half of bisected crypts, villus epithelium, or undifferentiated crypt epithelial cells, suggesting a lineage-specific role for mIKCa1 in mouse small bowel epithelium. The cloned mIKCa1 channel was calcium-activated and was blocked by ten structurally diverse peptide and nonpeptide inhibitors with potencies spanning 9 orders of magnitude and indistinguishable from that of the human homologue. Consistent with channel blockade, charybdotoxin, clotrimazole, and the highly selective IKCa1 inhibitors, TRAM-34 and TRAM-39, inhibited (∼50%) Paneth cell secretion stimulated by bacteria or bacterial lipopolysaccharide, measured both as bactericidal activity and secreted cryptdin protein, but the inactive analog, TRAM-7, did not block secretion.

Generally containing fewer than 40 amino acids, these biochemically diverse peptides have secondary structures that range from linear α-helical molecules to β-sheet peptides constrained by up to four disulfide connectivities, including the covalently closed circular θ-defensins (2Borregaard N. Elsbach P. Ganz T. Garred P. Svejgaard A. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 68-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In mammals, the α-defensins are cationic, 3–4-kDa peptides with a characteristic tridisulfide array, and they occur in phagocytic leukocyte granules from which they mediate nonoxidative killing of ingested microbial cells following phagolysosomal fusion (3Ganz T.

In crypts of the small intestinal epithelium, Paneth cells accumulate high levels of α-defensins that are termed cryptdins in mice, and which they secrete in response to bacterial or pharmacologic stimuli. Paneth cells participate in innate mucosal immunity by discharging α-defensins at millimolar concentrations. Bacteria or bacterial antigens stimulate mouse Paneth cells to release apical secretory granules that contain several bactericidal peptides and proteins of which the cryptdins account for ∼70% of the secreted microbicidal peptide activity (10Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 113-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The secretory responses occur within minutes of exposure to soluble bacterial antigens or to carbamyl choline and are dose-dependent, suggesting a receptor-mediated process (10Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 113-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). In mouse small intestinal crypts stimulated with carbamyl choline, the cytosolic calcium dynamics change only in Paneth cells in a biphasic pattern consistent with mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores followed by influx of extracellular Ca2+ (14Satoh Y.

These observations led to the hypothesis that Paneth cell secretion in response to bacterial stimuli may be modulated by a cation-selective channel that could regulate the influx of extracellular Ca2+. Intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+channels are the product of the IKCa1 genes (also known as IK1, hKCa4, hSK4, KCNN4) and are important in regulating the membrane potential of colonic epithelial cells, and lymphocytes, and in the volume regulation of red blood cells (16Ishii T.M.

IKCa channels have an intermediate single channel conductance of 11 picosiemens in sodium and 40 picosiemens in potassium Ringer, are voltage-independent, and open in response to changes in intracellular Ca2+.

A custom cDNA library was constructed by Stratagene Cloning Systems, Inc. (La Jolla, CA) using crypt mRNA as template for reverse transcription of single-stranded cDNA with oligo(dT)18–20 to prime the reverse transcriptase reaction from the mRNA 3′ termini. Double-stranded cDNAs with adapted termini were cloned in the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the phagemid vector Uni-ZAP XR (Stratagene Cloning Systems). Cloning was performed without polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of sequences or size exclusion of low molecular weight mRNAs. The library contained ∼9.8 × 106 primary clones and was amplified to a working titer of 3.9 × 1010plaque-forming units/ml. Bacteriophages containing mIKCa1 were identified in the crypt library by screening ∼5 × 106 plaque-forming units in duplicate by hybridization at 42 °C in 1 m NaCl, 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 1% SDS with 32P-labeled probes consisting of 360 bp from the 5′-NCR of hIKCa1 (GenBankTM accession number AF033021). Filters were washed three times with continuous agitation at 50 °C with 0.5 × SSC (1 × SSC = 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate), 1% SDS, and autoradiograms were exposed at −70 °C. Forty-six positive clones were identified, shown to have identical or overlapping restriction patterns, and all clones sequenced within the IKCa1 coding region were identical to mIKCa1. Plaque-purified phage were excised to plasmid forms and subjected to digestion with restriction enzymes and DNA sequence analysis. All clones corresponded to the mouse Ca2+-activated K+ channel, mIKCa1.

The complete mouse intestinal crypt mIKCa1 cDNA sequence was identical to those reported previously from mouse bone marrow (GenBankTM accession numbersAF042487 and NM008433) and embryonic mouse liver (GenBankTMaccession number AK010943). Intact crypts and villi were prepared as described previously (10Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Nat.

Crypts were bisected by suspending crypt preparations at low density in 0.6% agarose in PBS at 50 °C, poured onto the surface of a microscope slide, and allowed to solidify. Individual crypts were bisected under phase microscopy using pulled capillary pipettes that were broken to produce knife edges. For preparation and isolation of single Paneth cells, crypt preparations were incubated in 2 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution with 150 units/ml collagenase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were deposited by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min in a Beckman GS-6R centrifuge, resuspended, and washed two times with ice-cold PBS, and the preparation was centrifuged through a 30-μm filter Cell Strainer cap (Falcon model 352235). Paneth cells and agranular crypt epithelial cells were identified under phase microscopy, drawn into capillary tubes and transferred to PCR reaction tubes for amplification. For RT-PCR experiments, isolated villi, intact crypts, bisected crypts, or isolated single Paneth cells were transferred to individual microcentrifuge tubes, sonicated in 1 μl of RNAguard RNase inhibitor, and stored at −70 °C. Detection of mIKCa1 required that RT-PCR be performed with nested primer sets. RNA from intestinal epithelial cells and structures were amplified with GeneAmp EZ rTth RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Samples (500 ng) of total RNA from mouse bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, testis, heart, stomach, small intestine (proximal, mid, distal), cecum, colon, and developing small intestine also were analyzed similarly (data not shown). The external amplimers consisted of primers mIKCa1F1, 5′-GCCAG GTACG GCTGA AACAC, which corresponds to nucleotides 1224–1244 on the mIKCa1 sense strand within exon 7 and mIKCa1R1, 5′-CGTGG GAGGT CCAAT TCAGT, which corresponds to nucleotides 1624–1643 on the mIKCa1 antisense strand in exon 8. Reaction mixes were denatured and subjected to 45 cycles as follows: 94 °C, 1 min; 50 °C, 1.5 min; 72 °C, 2 min with a final extension reaction of 9 min at 72 °C terminated by rapid cooling to 4 °C. Detection of mIKCa1 required an additional round of amplification using the following set of internal amplimers: mIKCa1F2, 5′-ACATG ATCCT GTGCG ACCTG corresponding to nucleotides 1293–1312 on the mIKCa1 sense strand and also in exon 7 paired with mIKCa1R2, 5′-TCAAC GTGGA TCCAC GTGGG corresponding to nucleotides 1567–1586 on the mIKCa1 antisense strand in exon 8. Samples consisting of 5 μl of 1:100 dilutions of the initial RT-PCR reaction products were used as template for nested amplification. PCR mixes lacking AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase were preheated at 94 °C for 2 min, then complete reaction mixes were cycled as before. Samples of the PCR reactions were analyzed by separation in 2% agarose gels to visualize the 293-bp product, and the fragments were purified with QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or transferred to nylon membranes to identify mIKCa1 by hybridization with an hIKCa1 probe (29Darmoul D. Brown D. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G197-G206PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ghanshani S. Coleman M. Gustavsson P. Wu A.C. Gargus J.J. Gutman G.A. Dahl N. Mohrenweiser H. Chandy K.G. Genomics. 1998; 51: 160-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Amplification of mIKCa1 was performed a minimum of four times on unstained, freshly prepared crypts. The 293-bp amplification product was cloned into the TOPO II TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), and its identity as the appropriate region of mIKCa1 sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing (data not shown). To test for a role for mIKCa1 in Paneth cell secretion, the inhibitory effects of K+ channel blockers were tested in an ex vivo crypt assay system as described previously (10Ayabe T. Satchell D.P.

One-thousand crypts were incubated in 1 ml of isotonic PIPES buffer, consisting of 10 mm PIPES with 0.8% sodium gluconate (pH 7.4), with the appropriate inhibitor plus 106 colony-forming units (cfu) Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, or E. coliLPS (Sigma) or in buffer alone at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples of elicited secretions were collected and analyzed for bactericidal activity and in Western blots for cryptdins. Samples (10 μl) of collected secretions or control supernatants were tested for bactericidal activity against 1,000 cfu of the defensin-sensitiveS. typhimurium phoP− strain in 40 μl of PIPES buffer, and surviving bacteria were quantitated as cfu on nutrient agar after overnight growth at 37 °C (10Ayabe T.

In this assay, ∼1000 crypts were suspended in 1 ml of a nominally calcium-free medium (10 mmPIPES, 0.8% sodium gluconate (pH 7.4)) and exposed to 1 × 106 bacterial cfu per crypt or to 100 ng/ml E. coli LPS to elicit Paneth cell secretion (10Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 113-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated a minumum of three times on freshly prepared crypts. Proteins extracted from collected secretions were analyzed for cryptdins by Western blotting following separation by acid-urea PAGE. Briefly, the samples were analyzed on a 12.5% acrylamide acid-urea PAGE gel containing 5 m urea as described previously (10Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 113-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, resolved Paneth cell protein secretions were transferred from gels to nitrocellulose membranes (0.22 μm), and blocked membranes were incubated sequentially with rabbit anti-mouse cryptdin-1 antibody (1:500), peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000), and chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal, Pierce), and x-ray films were exposed to blots as described previously (10Ayabe T.

The mIKCa1 coding region was cloned into pcDNA 3.1, and the construct was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pharmacology of mIKCa1 was determined in the whole cell mode of the patch-clamp technique using a holding potential of −80 mV. A pipette solution containing 145 mm K+ aspartate, 10 mm K2EGTA, 8.5 mmCaCl2, 2.0 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2, 290–310 mosm), with a calculated free [Ca2+]i of 1 μm was used to activate mIKCa1. To eliminate native COS cell chloride currents, sodium aspartate Ringer solution (160 mmNa+ aspartate, 4.5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 290–310 mosm) was used as an external solution. Currents were elicited by 200-ms voltage ramps from −120 to 40 mV every 10 s, and the reduction of slope conductance at −80 mV by channel antagonists were taken as a measure of channel blocking. The recording in Fig. 3A was done on excised inside-out patches with the external solution described above as pipette solution. K+ aspartate solutions containing 1 μm and 50 nm free [Ca2+] were applied to the cytoplasmic side of the patch. CLT, econazole, and tetraethylammonium were from Sigma; nifedipine was from RBI (Natick, MA); ChTX, ChTX-Glu32, and ShK (Stichodactyla helianthus toxin) were from Bachem Biosciences (King of Prussia, PA). The synthesis and specificities of ChTX-Glu32 (23Rauer H. Lanigan M.D. Pennington M.W. Aiyar J. Ghanshani S. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1201-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and the triarylmethanes TRAM-3, TRAM-7, TRAM-34, and TRAM-39 have been described previously (22Wulff H.

A cDNA library prepared from isolated adult mouse small intestinal crypts was screened in duplicate with a probe from the 5′-NCR of hIKCa1 (GenBankTM accession numberAF033021). Forty-six positive clones with identical or overlapping restriction patterns were identified in the mouse crypt library. The complete 1278-bp coding sequence was obtained in several isolates, but the remaining 175 bp of 5′-NCR was determined by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The composite mIKCa1 sequence contains 302 bp of 5′-NCR, 1278 bp of coding sequence, and 496 bp of 3′-NCR. The sequence is identical to amplified mIKCa1 coding regions from the MEL murine erythroleukemia cell line characterized previously (GenBankTM accession numbers AF042487, AF072884, and NM_008433) and with full-length mIKCa1 cDNA from mouse embryonic liver (GenBankTM accession number AK010943). mIKCa1 cDNA alignments with existing mouse genomic DNA sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers AC073693 andAC073810) showed that the intron-exon organization of the mIKCa1 gene is identical to that in the hIKCa1 homologue (Fig.1). Comparison of the hIKCa1 cDNA and genomic sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers AF022797 andAF305731–AF305735) with mIKCa1 sequences revealed >90% nucleotide sequence identity from nucleotide 97 of the human transcript through the coding region and 3′-NCR. The hIKCa1 coding region is 6 nucleotides longer than mIKCa1, coding for two additional residues in the S3-S4 loop. The deduced mIKCa1 protein differs from hIKCa1 at 53 additional positions, most differences being in the S2 and S3 segments, and in the C terminus. These cloning results show that mIKCa1 is expressed by mouse small intestinal crypt epithelium. The intestinal epithelial cell lineages that express the mIKCa1 gene in mouse small intestinal epithelium were determined using a nested RT-PCR assay. Consistent with previous reports (18Vandorpe D.H. Shmukler B.E. Jiang L. Lim B. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. de Franceschi L. Cappellini M.D. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37137-37149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), RT-PCR analysis of whole organ RNA showed that mIKCa1 mRNA was present in adult mouse bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, testis, heart, stomach, small intestine, cecum, and colon (data not shown). Also, mIKCa1 mRNA was amplified equivalently from whole organ RNA throughout the gastrointestinal tract, and its detection in neonatal mouse small bowel RNA (not shown) showed that mIKCa1 gene expression precedes crypt ontogeny and the differentiation of epithelial cell lineages. Because amplification of whole organ RNA provides no information as to sites of gene expression, we attempted to determine the cell types expressing mIKCa1 mRNA in small bowel byin situ hybridization. However, mIKCa1 mRNA levels were insufficient to detect hybridization, and therefore small intestinal mIKCa1 expression was investigated by the RT-PCR analysis of isolated epithelial structures and cells. In mice, Paneth cells were the primary small intestinal epithelial cell lineage found to express mIKCa1. To identify the small intestinal cell types expressing mIKCa1, nested RT-PCR assays were performed on isolated intact villus epithelium (Fig.2A, “arrow a”), intact crypts (Fig. 2A, “arrow b”), bisected crypts (Fig. 2A, “arrows c andd”), single Paneth cells (Fig. 2A, “arrows g and h”), or single undifferentiated crypt cells (Fig. 2A, “arrows i andj”). Individual structures or cells were transferred to separate microfuge tubes, mIKCa1 cDNA was amplified using sequence-specific nested amplimers, and the products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (see “Experimental Procedures”). mIKCa1 mRNA was detected in intact crypts (Fig. 2B, lane b) but not in villus epithelium (Fig. 2B, lane a), and analyses of bisected crypts showed that mIKCa1 mRNA was present only in the lower portion of the crypt (Fig. 2B,lane d) but not in the upper half (Fig. 2B,lane c). Since the lower half of the crypt contains Paneth cells as well as undifferentiated crypt epithelial cells that are agranular, RT-PCR assays were conducted on both these cell populations isolated from single cell suspensions of isolated crypts (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although Fig. 2 shows Paneth cells in crypts stained selectively with Amido Black (see “Experimental Procedures”), all RT-PCR experiments reported here were performed on unstained crypts and are representative of four separate determinations. Single cell RT-PCR detected mIKCa1 mRNA only in Paneth cells (Fig. 2B, lanes g and h, respectively, containing one or five individual Paneth cells), but not in agranular crypt epithelial cells (Fig. 2B, lanes i and j, one or five cells, respectively). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was amplified using RNA from all sources in Fig. 2 that were negative for mIKCa1 products (data not shown). Hybridization of a mIKCa1 cDNA probe to a Southern blot of the gel shown in the upper panel of Fig.2B was consistent with identification of the amplification products as mIKCa1 sequences (Fig. 2B, lower panel). The authenticity of the amplified products was verified by DNA sequence analysis (data not shown). Because mouse and human IKCa1 differ at 55 amino acid residue positions (13% difference), we compared the properties of the mouse channel heterologously expressed in COS-7 cells with that of human IKCa1. In the representative inside-out patch shown in Fig. 3A, mIKCa1 currents were induced by 1 μm free Ca2+, but not by 50 nm Ca2+, confirming the Ca2+dependence of this channel. In experiments done in the whole cell mode, the reversal potential of the mIKCa1 current shifted"

However, despite no such effect singly, combined anti- and proapoptotic stimuli inhibit Akt activity, leaving the cells susceptible to accelerated apoptosis. The blockade of Akt activation depended on reduced phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate levels but not decreased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, thus implicating the involvement of an inositol phosphatase. Evidence for SHIP involvement was provided by SHIP localization to membrane receptors and subsequent activation along with the observed inability of SHIP −/− neutrophils to exhibit enhanced apoptosis with the stimulus combination. Activation of SHIP was found to depend on Lyn activation, and this, in turn, required NADPH oxidase. Neutrophils from chronic granulomatous disease patients and Lyn −/− mice no longer responded to the combined stimuli. Thus, we propose a role for oxidants and Lyn in SHIP regulation and suggest a novel mechanism for regulating neutrophil apoptosis. Neutrophils undergo rapid spontaneous apoptosis.

Thus, we propose a role for oxidants and Lyn in SHIP regulation and suggest a novel mechanism for regulating neutrophil apoptosis. Once they have been released from the bone marrow, neutrophils have a remarkably short life span of only a few hours, with 80% undergoing apoptosis within 16–20 h of in vitro culture (1Savill J.S. Wylie A.H. Henson J.E. Walport M.J. Henson P.M. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). This rapid induction of apoptosis is thought to be the result of a preprogrammed, or spontaneous, apoptotic sequence that, in the absence of additional signals, leads to surface changes on the cell and clearance from the circulation (2Haslett C. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1992; 83: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 3Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P.W. Westcott J.Y. Henson P.M. J. Clin.

We have recently suggested that repetitive engagement of cell surface β2-integrins within the vasculature, including transvascular emigration of the cells during an inflammatory reaction, may serve as one protective stimulus to prolong the cells' life span (4Whitlock B.B.

However, within the inflammatory lesion, neutrophils encounter a complex milieu of pro- and antiapoptotic stimuli whose combined effect will determine the life span of the cells. Protective stimuli include integrin ligation, a wide variety of chemokines and other chemoattractants, GM-CSF, 1The abbreviations used are:GM-CSFgranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factorPI 3-kinasephosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseTNFtumor necrosis factorDHRdihydrorhodamine-123LPSlipopolysaccharideDPIdiphenyleneiodonium chloridePtdInsphosphatidylinositolPIP3phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphatePIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateCGDchronic granulomatous disease and even bacterial lipopolysaccharide (9Coxon A.

In contrast, proapoptotic stimuli commonly encountered within an inflammatory lesion would include TNFα, Fas ligand, and a variety of oxidants (11Takeda Y. Watanabe H. Yonehara S. Yamashita T.

The combination of proapoptotic stimuli with integrin activation appears to initiate a synergistic induction of apoptosis (4Whitlock B.B. Gardai S. Fadok V. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), a process that may be critical for surface exposure of phosphatidylserine and eventual clearance from the tissue by local phagocytes. This clearance, in turn, results in the production of anti-inflammatory molecules and the subsequent resolution of the inflammatory reaction (3Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P.W.

These processes not only block spontaneous apoptosis but have also been shown to block apoptosis induced by UV irradiation, TNFα, or ligation of Fas (17Zundel W. Giaccia A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17612-17618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In the combined presence of integrin engagement and proapoptotic stress stimuli, however, we have provided evidence for down-regulation or bypass of these antiapoptotic effects with induction of rapid neutrophil apoptosis (4Whitlock B.B. Gardai S. Fadok V. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The serine/threonine kinase Akt has been shown to inhibit both spontaneous and stress-induced apoptosis and appears to be responsible for regulating growth factor-mediated cell survival (20Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). Akt is activated by a variety of growth factors via PI 3-kinase-generated phosphatidylinositols (20Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase phosphorylates phosphoinositides (PI) on the 3′-position of the inositol ring to generate PtdIns 3-monophosphate, PtdIns 3,4-bisphosphate, and PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate (21Kappeller R. Cantley L.C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Generation of PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate allows for recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane via its PH domain (22Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Once at the plasma membrane, PDK1 and an as yet unknown serine/threonine kinase phosphorylate Akt, thereby inducing its activation (22Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Active Akt is thought to inhibit apoptosis in a variety of ways both upstream and downstream of mitochondrial perturbation. It can inhibit caspase 9 activity, phosphorylate proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bad, or regulate activation of transcription factors such as CREB, NF-κB, and members of the Forkhead family (20Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar, 22Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp.

This makes Akt a prime candidate for regulation in the circumstance of paradoxical anti- and proapoptotic signal combinations. Prevention of Akt activation in this circumstance could occur by the inhibition of PI 3-kinase or the activation of a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase, each leading to reduced Akt activation and translocation. SHIP (SH2-containing inositol 5-phosphatase) is a 145-kDa protein highly expressed in hematopoetic cells (24Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold R. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). It specifically hydrolyzes the 5′-phosphate from PtdIns 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate and PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate, the predominant product of PI 3-kinase (25Krystal G. Damen J.E. Helgason C.D. Huber M.

SHIP overexpression has been shown to inhibit Akt activity, whereas SHIP null cells exhibit sustained Akt activity (26Liu Q. Sasaki T. Kozieradzki I. Wakeham A. Itie A. Dumont D.J. Penninger J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). SHIP has also been shown to down-regulate prosurvival and proliferative signals in vivo as reviewed in Ref. 27Liu L. Damen J.E. Ware M. Hughes M. Krystal G. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar. Stimulation of B cells by the antigen receptor activates PI 3-kinase and its downstream target Akt and results in proliferation (28Otero D.C. Omori S.A. Rickert R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1474-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, co-clustering with the B-cell IgG receptor, FcγRII, results in decreased activation of Akt and inhibition of BCR-induced proliferation (29Carver D.J. Aman M.J. Ravichandran K.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chacko G.W. Tridandapani S. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2234-2238PubMed Google Scholar). The down-regulation of Akt is due to SHIP recruitment from the cytosol to the membrane ITIM domain of FcγRII upon concomitant BCR and FcγRII ligation (31Tridandapani S. Kelley T. Pradhan M. Cooney D.

The mechanism by which SHIP is regulated remains controversial, although it is known that the molecule must be recruited from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane for activation (32Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19090-19097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The hypothesis to be examined herein is whether the combination of antiapoptotic and stress stimuli activates SHIP and subsequently blocks Akt-derived antiapoptotic pathways in neutrophils, resulting in enhanced apoptosis. Our data support the notion that both antiapoptotic and stress signals can each activate PI 3-kinase and Akt on their own but that the combination of these stimuli leads to the complete abrogation of Akt activity via a decrease in PIP3 levels independent of alterations in PI 3-kinase activity. The blockade of Akt appears to be due to NADPH oxidase-derived oxidants and their ability to activate Lyn, which can aid in the recruitment of SHIP to the plasma membrane. Once at the plasma membrane, SHIP appears to associate with the β2-integrin as well as other antiapoptotic signaling receptors, and once there it can modulate PIP3 levels and subsequently apoptosis.

The NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) and catalase were obtained from Sigma and used at 5 μg/ml or 1000 units/ml, respectively. The Src family kinase inhibitor PPI was obtained from Alexis (San Diego, CA) and used at 10 μg/ml. Phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). [3H]Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). PtdIns 4,5-bisphosphate and PtdIns 4-monophosphate were obtained from Sigma. Human neutrophils were purified from whole blood as described previously (33Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnston R.B., Jr. Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophil purity was >95% with typically ≤2% eosinophils. Following isolation, neutrophils were suspended at 2 × 106cells/ml in RPMI supplemented with 1% LPS-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma; A-1933) and incubated in conical polypropylene tubes (Sarstedt, as control; Sparks, NV). Neutrophils, with or without β2-integrin reagent VIM12 (1 μg/ml) or anti-HLA (1 μg/ml), were allowed to apoptose for 4 h in the presence or absence of anti-Fas IgM (1 μg/ml) or TNFα (1000 units/ml). Apoptosis was assessed as by Whitlock et al. (4Whitlock B.B. Gardai S. Fadok V. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Akt activity was measured using an enzyme activity kit (Upstate Biotechnology) with some modification of the provided protocol. Cells were resuspended at 7.5 × 106/ml cells and stimulated with either 10 ng of GM-CSF (R & D Systems) or 100 ng/ml LPS (List Biological) for 5 min or 1 μg/ml VIM12 or anti-HLA for 15 min in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml anti-Fas IgM or 1000 units/ml TNFα. Cells were lysed in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (supplemented with 15 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate), and Akt activity was measured as by Whitlock et al. (4Whitlock B.B. Gardai S. Fadok V. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Western blots were carried out the same way, except immunoprecipitates were boiled in Lammeli buffer, run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and probed with a 1:1000 sheep anti-phospho-Akt antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Blots were stripped as by Frasch et al. (8Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Worthen G.S. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8389-8397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and reprobed with an anti-Akt antibody for equal loading. Lyn samples were stimulated for 10 min with the indicated stimuli and then lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40 with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 15 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin) for 10 min on ice. Lysates were then cleared by centrifugation, and supernatants were transferred to 25 μg of protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) beads containing 1 μg of rabbit anti-Lyn antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 4 h with rotation. Immunoprecipitates were then boiled, run on a 10% gel, transferred, and then probed with 1:1000 anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology) overnight. SHIP samples were lysed according to Liu et al. (27Liu L. Damen J.E. Ware M. Hughes M. Krystal G. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SHIP was imunoprecipitated, run on a 7% gel, and probed with anti-CD11b clone 44 (Sigma) or anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 overnight. Immunoblots were visualized with ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). All immunoblots were stripped as by Frasch et al. (8Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Worthen G.S. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8389-8397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and then reprobed with either anti-Lyn or anti-SHIP to confirm equal protein levels. Neutrophils were [32P]orthophosphate-labeled as described previously (34Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. FEBS. 1992; 309: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, neutrophils were suspended at 1 × 108/ml in buffer A (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 110 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose) and 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min, at which point they were washed three times in buffer A. Labeled cells were then treated as in the apoptosis studies for 10 min. Reactions were stopped with the addition of 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) followed by 4 ml of chloroform, 2.4 m HCl (1:1, v/v). The resultant organic phase was removed, and the aqueous phase was washed four times. The combined organic phases were evaporated to dryness under N2. Dried lipids were resuspended in 20 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and run on 20 × 20-cm silica gel 60 plates (Whatman) impregnated with 1% potassium oxalate. Plates were developed in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (80:30:26:24:14, v/v/v/v/v). Radiolabeled phospholipids were detected by autoradiography. Standard PtdIns/PtdIns-4-P/PtdIns-3,4-P2 were co-chromatographed and visualized by I2 vapor. Neutrophils were resuspended at 5 × 106/ml and treated as above for 10 min, at which time they were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 15 μg/ml leupeptin, and aprotinin at 4 °C for 20 min. Lysates were transferred to protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) beads containing 1 μg of anti-PI 3-kinase antibody (Upstate Biotechnology clone UB93–3) for 2 h, at which point they were spun down and washed three times with kinase buffer (50 mmHEPES (pH 7.25), 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5 mmMgCl2). Reaction were then performed as described previously (24Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold R. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 40 μl of the wash buffer containing 25 μm ATP and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were initiated with 10 μl of PtdIns sonicated in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). Reactions were allowed to go for 10 min at 37 °C and then stopped with 20 μl of 6 n HCl and 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Samples were allowed to sit for 10 min and then spun for 10 min to separate the organic and aqueous phase. The lower organic phase was applied to silica 60 TLC plate and developed in CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2). Plates were dried, and the kinase reaction was visualized by autoradiography. Preparation of [32P]PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate and SHIP assays were carried out as described before (24Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold R. Rohrschneider L.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19090-19097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were stimulated as in the Akt activity assay for 10 min, at which time samples were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-SHIP for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were then incubated with 25 μl of [32P]PIP3 or 50 μm3H-labeled PtdIns 1,3,4,5-P4 in reaction buffer for 20 min. Reactions were stopped with 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and 100 μl of 2 m KCl. Dried phospholipids were dissolved in 30 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and separated on TLC as in the metabolic labeling. 32P samples were visualized by autoradiograph, with the position of [32P]PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate and [32P]PtdIns 3,4-bisphosphate determined by the mobility of 32P in vitro labeled phosphatidylinositol and PIP2 standards.3H samples were washed, dried, and resuspended and ran as above; positions were confirmed with I2 visualization of commercial standards as well as the position of [32P]PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate and [32P]PtdIns 3,4-bisphosphate prepared standards. Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate was excised from TLC plates solublized in HCl/methanol (1:1) for 1 h and then counted in a scintillation counter as described by Siddiqi et al. (35Siddiqi A.R. Srajer G.E. Leslie C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1497: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mouse peritoneal exudate neutrophils were isolated following the methods of Savige et al. (36Savige J.A. Saverymuttu S.H. Pinching A.J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1984; 58: 737-744PubMed Google Scholar). Cytospun samples revealed a highly enriched neutrophil population (>90%) with occasional macrophages. Typical yields were ∼20 × 106 peritoneal neutrophils/mouse for SHIP and Lyn +/+ and 35 × 106 peritoneal neutrophils/mouse for SHIP and Lyn −/− mice. Neutrophils were resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml and incubated with 1 μg/ml of the murine activating anti-CD18 antibody, clone M18/2 (37Driessens M.H. van Hulten P. Zuurbier A., La Riviere G. Roos E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), in the presence or absence of murine TNFα, anti-Fas (Jo2), which was cross-linked with secondary antibody. Cells were incubated for 4 h before apoptosis was assessed with the human neutrophils. Dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was performed as described by Vowells and colleagues (38Vowells S.J. Sekhsaria S. Malech H.L. Shalit M. Fleisher T.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 178: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Briefly, neutrophils were preloaded with 1.0 × 10−5 nm dihydrorhodamine-123 for 5 min in a 37 °C shaking water bath prior to the addition of stimuli. Following a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry (FL-2, FACScalibur; Becton Dickinson). CGD blood was obtained with the help of Dr. Dan Ambruso. Blood was drawn from three individuals, each displaying different mutations. One patient displayed a gp15 X-linked form, and the other two had an autorecessive mutation in either p67 or p22 of NADPH oxidase. All patients were deficient in NADPH oxidase-derived oxidants as tested by superoxide generation by Dr. Ambruso. Neutrophils were isolated as described above. Averages and SD values were calculated from at least three experiments. Statistical analysis was carried out using the JMP statistical programs (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Details concerning the statistical tests used for each experiment can be found in the figure legends. Several cytokines and membrane receptor signals, such as β2-integrin activation, GM-CSF, LPS, and even low doses of TNFα (1 μg/ml) can activate Akt and thus inhibit neutrophil apoptosis (6Lee A. Whyte M.K. Haslett C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). However, previous observations have shown that neutrophils incubated simultaneously with the antiapoptotic β2-integrin-activating antibody VIM12 along with the stress stimuli TNFα, anti-Fas IgM, or UV irradiation no longer exhibited inhibition of apoptosis but rather an enhancement of this process (Fig. 1 A and Ref. 4Whitlock B.B. Gardai S. Fadok V. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Each stress stimulus alone resulted in a marked increase in neutrophil apoptosis compared with control, although we observed that lower concentrations of TNFα had an antiapoptotic effect. On the other hand, combining the opposing stimuli resulted in an increase in apoptosis above each stress stimulus alone. The Akt/protein kinase B pathway is the common antiapoptotic signaling pathway stimulated by β2-integrin activation, LPS, GM-CSF, and TNFα. Blockade of this pathway upon the combination of antiapoptotic and stress stimuli could result in the enhanced apoptosis seen in our system. Incubation of neutrophils with either 100 nm GM-CSF or 100 ng LPS for 5 min or with 1 μg/ml of the β2-integrin activation antibody VIM12 for 15 min increased Akt activity above base line (Fig. 1 B). Stress stimuli alone, either TNFα or anti-Fas IgM, also increased Akt activity. However, the combination of anti-apoptotic and stress stimuli resulted in the complete prevention of Akt activation. This effect on Akt was not seen when cells were treated with a control antibody against HLA, which neither stimulated Akt activity on its own nor attenuated anti-Fas IgM- or TNFα-generated Akt activity. Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B, inset) correlated with its activity in that Akt phosphorylation reverted to control levels upon combining VIM12 with anti-Fas IgM or TNFα. Since Akt activation requires recruitment of Akt to PIP3 lipids in the plasma membrane via its PH domain (20Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar), the effect of pro- and antiapoptotic stimulus combinations on PIP3 levels was assessed in [32P]orthophosphate-labeled neutrophils. Neutrophils were labeled and then incubated with the antiapoptotic β2-integrin activation stimulus in the presence or absence of the stress stimuli. All of the individual stimuli alone enhanced PIP3 production above control; however, upon the combination of antiapoptotic and stress stimuli, the levels of PIP3 significantly decreased back to control levels (Fig.2 A). The combination of anti-HLA and TNFα or anti-Fas IgM showed no reduction in PIP3 levels (data not shown). The reduction in PIP3 suggested either that the combined stimuli inhibited PI 3-kinase activity or that a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase was activated. To examine whether the reduction in PIP3 levels was due to down-regulated PI 3-kinase, PI 3-kinase activity was measured directly after stimulation with VIM12 in the presence or absence of TNFα or anti-Fas IgM. Control (unstimulated) cells showed moderate PI 3-kinase activity in accordance with reported observations (34Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. FEBS. 1992; 309: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This activity was markedly enhanced in the cells incubated with the antiapoptotic or the stress stimuli alone. Importantly, the stimulation of PI 3-kinase was not inhibited or decreased upon the combination of antiapoptotic β2-integrin activation and stress stimuli (Fig. 2 B). However, cells incubated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY98062 (100 nm) showed almost complete inhibition of activity (data not shown). Since PI 3-kinase activity was not altered but PIP3 levels were decreased when the two stimulus types were combined, activation of a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase was examined. Candidates included SHIP and PTEN. SHIP recruitment to the plasma membrane was examined d"

Accordingly, the present experiments were designed to show that α-chloro fatty aldehydes are produced by activated neutrophils and to determine their physiologic effects. A sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique was developed to detect pentafluorobenzyl oximes of α-chloro fatty aldehydes utilizing negative ion chemical ionization. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate activation of neutrophils resulted in the production of both 2-chlorohexadecanal and 2- chlorooctadecanal through a myeloperoxidase-dependent mechanism that likely involved the targeting of both 16 and 18 carbon vinyl ether-linked aliphatic groups present in the sn-1 position of neutrophil plasmalogens. 2-Chlorohexadecanal was also produced by fMLP-treated neutrophils.

Activated neutrophils consume oxygen to produce an array of damaging reactive oxidizing species including superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide. Although hydrogen peroxide is substantially less reactive and harmful than its precursor, superoxide anion, the oxidizing potential of hydrogen peroxide is amplified by its conversion, mediated by myeloperoxidase at plasma chloride concentrations, to the reactive chlorinating species hypochlorous acid (HOCl) (6Harrison J.E. Schultz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1371-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Weiss S.J. Klein R. Slivka A. Wei M. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 70: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In activated neutrophils, hydrogen peroxide is produced and released concomitant with the release of the heme protein myeloperoxidase resulting in the generation of hypochlorous acid. Hypochlorous acid, in equilibrium with its conjugate anion hypochlorite (−OCl) and molecular chlorine (Cl2), mediates several critical reactions that are responsible for some of the cytotoxic properties of activated neutrophils (6Harrison J.E.

Alkene groups (–C=C–) of cholesterol or unsaturated aliphatic groups of fatty acids are particularly susceptible targets for modification collectively by reactive chlorinating species resulting in the production of chlorohydrins (9Winterbourn C.C. van den Berg J.J.

Recently, we demonstrated in a cell-free system that myeloperoxidase-derived reactive chlorinating species target the sn-1 vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens (26Albert C. Crowley J. Hsu F. Thukkani A. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23733-23741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this cell-free system, a neutral lipid was released from plasmalogens treated with a reactive chlorinating species that was identified as an α-chloro fatty aldehyde. The present results now demonstrate for the first time that the α-chloro fatty aldehydes, 2-chlorohexadecanal (2-ClHDA)1 and 2-chlorooctadecanal (2-ClODA) are produced when neutrophils are activated through a mechanism that includes the production of myeloperoxidase-derived reactive chlorinating species that attack both neutrophil and endothelial cell plasmalogen pools. Additionally, 2-ClHDA induces neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro, and this may play an important role in the ongoing recruitment and perpetuation of neutrophil-mediated inflammation in vivo.

All other reagents and chemicals were purchased from Aldrich, Sigma, Fisher, or Nu-Check Prep. 2-Chloro-[7,7,8,8-d4]-hexadecanal (2-Cl-[d4]-HDA) was synthesized by the following scheme: 1) synthesis of [7,7,8,8-d4]-hexadecanol from [7,7,8,8-d4]-hexadecanoic acid (Medical Isotopes, Inc.) using sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride; 2) synthesis of [7,7,8,8-d4]-hexadecanal by partial oxidation at −70 °C utilizing oxalyl chloride-activated dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) as a catalyst (30Mancuso A.J.

Chem. 1978; 43: 2480-2482Crossref Scopus (2056) Google Scholar); 3) synthesis of the dimethyl acetal of [7,7,8,8-d4]-hexadecanal by acid methanolysis; 4) synthesis of the dimethyl acetal of 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA utilizing an acetal chlorination system employing MnO2-trimethylchlorosilane (31Bellesia F. Boni M. Ghelfi F. Grandi R. Pagnoni U.M. Pinetti A. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 4579-4586Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar); and 5) synthesis of 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA by refluxing in 1:1 trifluoroacetic acid/dichloromethane. The synthetic 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA was purified by HPLC utilizing a Dynamax Si column (21.4 × 250 mm; 8 μm) and gradient elution with hexane as the initial mobile phase and hexane/chloroform (90:10, v/v) as the final mobile phase at a flow rate of 6 ml/min. Utilizing this system, 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA eluted in 3% chloroform and the purity was confirmed by TLC, as well as by GC-MS of its PFB oxime derivative (see below). Synthetic 2-ClHDA was prepared and purified by a similar scheme as that for the deuterated compound except that hexadecanol (Nu-Chek Prep) was the starting reagent. Whole blood (50 ml) was taken from healthy volunteers and anticoagulated with EDTA (final concentration 5.4 mm) prior to the isolation of neutrophils using a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient as previously described (32Ferrante A. Thong Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 36: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Pelleted neutrophils were resuspended in HBSS (pH 7.3) and immediately subjected to experimental protocols. In indicated experiments neutrophils were resuspended in HBSS supplemented with either 10 mm3-aminotriazole, 1 mm sodium cyanide, or 1 mmsodium azide. Neutrophils (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were stimulated with selected concentrations of PMA or fMLP for indicated times with reactions terminated by the addition of methanol containing the internal standard (20 pmol of 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA). Following Bligh and Dyer extraction of neutrophil lipids (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar), 2-ClHDA was quantitated following derivatization to its PFB oxime by GC-MS. In selected studies 2-ClHDA and its deuterated internal standard were purified from lipid extracts of experimentally treated neutrophils (2.5 × 106cells) by TLC utilizing silica gel G plates as the stationary phase and petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid (90:10:1, v/v/v) as the mobile phase (Rf of 2-ClHDA = 0.46). The products were converted to their respective PFB oximes and analyzed by GC-MS using selected ion monitoring (SIM). For chemotaxis studies, neutrophils were resuspended in a chemotaxis buffer comprised of HBSS (pH 7.3), 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and 10 mm HEPES at a concentration of 4 × 106neutrophils/ml. Neutrophil chemotaxis was assayed as previously described (34Zigmond S. Hirsch J.G. J. Exp. Med. 1973; 137: 387-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). PMA, fMLP, 2-ClHDA in Me2SO, or Me2SO controls were diluted in modified HBSS and loaded into the lower compartments of a Boyden chemotaxis chamber separated from the top compartment containing 2 × 105neutrophils (50 μl) by 3 μm pore-size cellulose nitrate filters. The Boyden chamber was incubated for 35 min at 37 °C and the filters were then stained and dehydrated, and chemotaxis was assessed by the leading front method as previously described (34Zigmond S. Hirsch J.G. J. Exp. Med. 1973; 137: 387-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Net migration through the filter was reported in micrometers. Neutrophil lipid extracts were dried under nitrogen and resuspended in 300 μl of ethanol followed by the addition of 300 μl of PFB hydroxylamine (6 mg/ml). The mixtures were vortexed for 5 min and incubated at 24 °C for 25 min. Following the addition of 1.2 ml of water, the reaction products were sequentially extracted into 1 ml of cyclohexane/diethyl ether (4:1, v/v), dried under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in 50 μl of petroleum ether for GC-MS analysis. GC-MS analysis of PFB oximes of α-chloro fatty aldehydes was performed on a Hewlett-Packard (Palo Alto, CA) 5973 mass spectrometer coupled to a Hewlett Packard 6890 gas chromatograph using the negative ion chemical ionization (NICI) mode with methane as the reagent gas. The source temperature was set at 150 °C. The electron energy was 240 eV, and the emission current was 300 μA. The PFB derivatives were separated on a J & W Scientific (Folsom, CA) DB-1 column (12.5 m, 0.2 mm. inner diameter, 0.33-μm film thickness). The injector and the transfer line temperatures were maintained at 250 °C. The GC oven was maintained at 150 °C for 3.5 min, increased at a rate of 30 °C/min to 270 °C, and held at 270 °C for an additional 2 min. Quantitation of 2-ClHDA was performed utilizing SIM by comparing the integrated peak area corresponding tom/z = 288 to that produced from the deuterated internal standard (i.e. m/z = 292). Vinyl ether (plasmalogen) content was measured as described previously (35Gottfried E. Rapport M. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In brief, crude lipid extracts from control and PMA-activated neutrophils were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.3 mm iodine and 90.4 mmKI in methanol/water (1:1, v/v) for 30 min prior to the addition of 4 ml of 95% ethanol. Vinyl ether content was determined by spectrophotometry at 355 nm utilizing the iodine extinction coefficient ε355 = 27,500 m−1cm−1. Bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells were cultured to confluency in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and washed in warm phosphate-buffered saline immediately prior to experiments utilizing 35-mm collagen-coated culture dishes. Neutrophils (2 × 107 cells) in the presence and absence of PMA were added in transwell chambers (Falcon) containing a polyethylene terephthalate membrane above endothelial cells (2 × 105 cells). Control experiments were performed in the absence of neutrophils. Following experimental intervals, lipids from wells containing neutrophils and endothelial cells were extracted separately for 2-ClHDA measurements by GC-MS following derivatization of the lipid extracts to prepare the PFB oxime of 2-ClHDA. We have previously demonstrated that reactive chlorinating species produced from the heme-containing enzyme myeloperoxidase attack the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens resulting in the production of an α-chloro fatty aldehyde (26Albert C. Crowley J. Hsu F. Thukkani A. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23733-23741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Accordingly, techniques were devised to quantitate the α-chloro fatty aldehyde, 2-ClHDA, in biological samples. For these studies, a deuterated internal standard, 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA, was synthesized and purified by HPLC. Both 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA and synthetic 2-ClHDA were converted to their PFB oxime derivatives, and then subjected to NICI GC-MS analysis. Fig. 1, Aand B shows the mass spectrum of the PFB oximes derived from synthetically prepared 2-ClHDA and the deuterated compound, 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA, respectively. In the former spectrum, the molecular anion (M−) containing a35Cl, and 37Cl atom is observed atm/z 469 and 471, respectively. The ratio of the abundance of these two ions is close to 3:1, a unique isotope pattern specific for molecules containing a chlorine atom. This is further evidenced by the observation of the fragment ionsm/z 35 (35Cl) and 37 (37Cl) with an abundance ratio of 3:1 in the same spectrum. The mass spectrum also contains structurally informative ions atm/z 414 (M −HF −Cl), 288/290, 196 and 178 (Fig.1C), which are characteristic to PFB oxime derivatives (36Hsu F.F. Hazen S.L. Giblin D. Turk J. Heinecke J.W. Gross M.L. Int. J. Mass Spectr. 1999; 187: 795-812Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The analogous (m/z + 4) ions atm/z 473/471 (M−), 418 (M −HF −Cl), 292/294, were also observed for the 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA, as well as the common fragment ions at m/z 196, 178, and 35/37 (Fig. 1,B and D). Importantly, NICI GC-MS analysis of the PFB oxime of 2-ClHDA and of 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA produced the structurally informative fragments atm/z = 288 and 292, respectively (Fig. 1,A and B) suggesting that SIM ofm/z = 288 and 292 from the PFB oxime derivatives of 2-ClHDA and 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA, respectively, could be used to quantitate 2-ClHDA (Fig.2, A and B). Furthermore, the utility of the synthetic deuterated internal standard and SIM-GC-MS of m/z = 288 and 292 for the quantitation of 2-ClHDA was demonstrated by the linear relationship between the ratio of integrated peak area ofm/z = 288 to m/z= 292 and the ratio of 2-ClHDA mass to 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA mass (slope = 0.99,R2 = 0.999) (Fig. 2C).Figure 2Selected ion monitoring GC-MS analysis of thePFB oxime derivative of 2-chlorohexadecanal and 2-chloro-[7,7,8,8-d4]-hexadecanal.20 pmol of 2-ClHDA and 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA were converted to their PFB oximes and subjected to GC-MS analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Selected ion monitoring for m/z = 288 from the PFB oxime of 2-ClHDA (A) and m/z = 292 for the PFB oxime of 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA (B) was performed. The PFB oximes of mixtures containing 20 pmol of 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA and increasing amounts of 2-ClHDA (5–60 pmol) were prepared and subjected to GC-MS analysis. The ratio of the integrated peak area for m/z = 288 to the integrated peak area for m/z = 292 was calculated and plotted versus the ratio of the mass of 2-ClHDA to 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA that was derivatized (C). The equation describing the line produced by linear regression of the data points was y = 0.99x + 8.5 × 10−3 with R2 = 0.999.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Selected ion monitoring of m/z = 288 (from 2-ClHDA) and 292 (from the deuterated internal standard) of samples prepared by treating crude chloroform extracts of control and PMA-stimulated neutrophils with PFB hydroxylamine revealed thatm/z = 288 (i.e. the fragment derived from 2-ClHDA) was only found in samples prepared from PMA-stimulated neutrophils in comparison to control neutrophils (Fig.3, A and B). There are two peaks (8.35 and 8.45 min) in the chromatogram, corresponding to the anti- and syn- isomer of the PFB oxime derivatives, respectively (36Hsu F.F. Hazen S.L. Giblin D. Turk J. Heinecke J.W. Gross M.L. Int. J. Mass Spectr. 1999; 187: 795-812Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these two peaks form/z = 288 derived from PMA-activated neutrophils had an identical retention time to that of the authentic PFB oxime of 2-ClHDA (compare with Fig. 2A). Fig. 3,C and D, are the chromatograms for SIM ofm/z = 288 to m/z= 292 in samples prepared from control and PMA-treated neutrophils, respectively, that were first subjected to TLC purification of 2-ClHDA prior to conversion to its PFB oxime and SIM-GC-MS. Thus, nearly identical ratios of m/z = 288 tom/z = 292 are observed in neutrophil samples prepared directly from crude lipid extracts as well as those subjected to TLC purification of 2-ClHDA (e.g. compare Fig. 3,A and B to C and D). In separate analyses, the acquired mass spectrum for the peak corresponding to m/z = 288 from PMA-activated neutrophil treatments (Fig. 3E) was similar to that produced by synthetic 2-ClHDA (Fig. 1A). Collectively, these data demonstrate for the first time that PMA-activated neutrophils produce 2-ClHDA. Next, SIM of m/z = 288 tom/z = 292 was used to quantitate 2-ClHDA in neutrophils stimulated with selected concentrations of PMA as well as fMLP, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant (37Bass D. Dechatelet L. McCall C. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 172-178PubMed Google Scholar). PMA stimulation of neutrophils resulted in at least twice the amount of 2-ClHDA compared with fMLP stimulation even at PMA concentrations that were 20-fold less than fMLP (Fig. 4A). The disparity between PMA- and fMLP-elicited 2-ClHDA production by neutrophils is likely because of the fact that PMA is a more effective activator of NADPH oxidase than fMLP (38McPhail L. Clayton C. Synderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5768-5775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that neutrophil-mediated 2-ClHDA production results from the degradation of neutrophil plasmalogens by myeloperoxidase-derived reactive chlorinating species because the myeloperoxidase inhibitors such as sodium azide, sodium cyanide, and 3-aminotriazole severely attenuated 2-ClHDA production in PMA-stimulated neutrophils (Fig. 4B). Because neutrophil plasmalogens contain vinyl ether-linked aliphatic groups of predominantly 16 and 18 carbons in length (39Kayganich K. Murphy R. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 64: 2965-2971Google Scholar), the production of 2-ClODA was also examined. As a first step in these studies, synthetic 2-ClODA was derivatized to its PFB oxime and subjected to GC-MS using NICI and SIM form/z = 316. Two peaks were identified at 9 and 9.2 min corresponding to the syn- and anti- isomers of the PFB oxime of 2-ClODA (Fig.5A). SIM ofm/z = 316 of samples prepared from neutrophils stimulated with PMA resulted in two peaks with identical retention times as that of the authentic standard (compare Fig. 5,B with A). In contrast, no detectable peaks were observed utilizing SIM of m/z = 316 with samples prepared from either control neutrophils or PMA-stimulated neutrophils in the presence of the myeloperoxidase inhibitor 3-aminotriazole (Figs. 5, C and D, respectively). Additionally, in separate analyses of the PFB oxime of synthetic 2-ClODA, the mass spectrum was acquired for the peak corresponding tom/z = 316 at 9.2 min (Fig. 5E). This mass spectrum was similar to that derived from the corresponding PFB oxime of 2-ClHDA (Fig. 1A). The fragment ionsm/z 316, 318, 442, 444, 497, and 499, reflect a mass increase of 28, corresponding to the two carbon increase in chain length. Furthermore, the mass spectrum of the peak corresponding tom/z = 316 at 9.2 min from samples prepared from PMA-stimulated neutrophils (Fig. 5F) was similar to that derived from the PFB oxime of synthetically prepared 2-ClODA (Fig.5E). Because it is likely that the sn-1 vinyl ether bond of the neutrophil plasmalogens is the only precursor of α-chloro fatty aldehydes produced by the action of reactive chlorinating species released during neutrophil activation, the vinyl ether content in control and PMA-stimulated neutrophils was quantitated utilizing the method of Gottfried and Rapport (35Gottfried E. Rapport M. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The vinyl ether (plasmalogen) content was not substantially different in control and PMA-stimulated neutrophils, respectively (∼19 nmol of vinyl ether groups/106 cells in control versus 19.5 nmol of vinyl ether groups/106 cells in the PMA group). It should be appreciated that the changes in 2-ClHDA measured in PMA-stimulated neutrophils ranged between 34 and 37 fmol/106 neutrophils although the mass of plasmalogen pool was three orders of magnitude greater. Thus, it is unlikely that significant changes in plasmalogen molecular species content following PMA activation would be observed under the conditions employed. However, these findings do underscore both the large abundance of plasmalogens that can be attacked by released reactive chlorinating species as well as the likely maintenance of neutrophil membrane integrity during PMA stimulation accompanied by the production of reactive chlorinating species and chlorinated fatty aldehydes. Although PMA-stimulated neutrophils produce α-chloro fatty aldehydes (see above), further studies were designed to determine whether reactive chlorinating species produced by neutrophils target endothelial cell plasmalogen pools to produce 2-ClHDA. For these studies, neutrophils were separated from endothelial cells by a polyethylene terephthalate membrane, and the lower compartment containing endothelial cells was examined for 2-ClHDA. Importantly, 2-ClHDA was not observed in the lower compartment under conditions with activated neutrophils (+PMN, +PMA) in the upper compartment but no endothelial cells in the lower compartment (Fig.6). This indicates that 2-ClHDA produced by neutrophils in the upper well does not transverse the membrane. Additionally, endothelial cells did not produce 2-ClHDA in the absence of neutrophils despite the presence of PMA. 2-ClHDA in the lower chamber containing endothelial cells was only observed when PMA-stimulated neutrophils were in the upper chamber (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results suggest that plasmalogens of neighboring cells of activated neutrophils can be attacked to produce 2-ClHDA. The potential physiological role of 2-ClHDA as a neutrophil chemoattractant was tested. Both 90 μm and 90 nm 2-ClHDA induced neutrophil chemotaxis significantly greater than their Me2SO controls (Fig.7). 2-ClHDA-mediated neutrophil chemotactic activity was slightly less than migration induced by the known neutrophil chemoattractant fMLP (Fig. 7). In contrast, PMA-elicited chemotaxis was 2-fold less than that elicited by fMLP and 2-ClHDA. It should be noted that this disparity between fMLP and PMA as chemoattractants is similar to that previously reported (37Bass D. Dechatelet L. McCall C. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 172-178PubMed Google Scholar). Additional experiments that included 2-ClHDA in the upper chamber of the Boyden chamber demonstrated that 2-ClHDA did not increase neutrophil chemokinesis (data not shown). Recently, we reported that in a cell-free system thesn-1 vinyl ether bond of plasmalogen phospholipids is specifically attacked by myeloperoxidase-derived reactive chlorinating species to generate the novel α-chloro fatty aldehyde, 2-ClHDA (26Albert C. Crowley J. Hsu F. Thukkani A. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23733-23741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because activated neutrophils release myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide (40Hampton M. Kettle A. Winterbourn C. Blood. 1998; 92: 3007-3017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the present study was designed to show the production of α-chloro fatty aldehydes by activated neutrophils. Utilizing NICI GC-MS analysis, 2-ClHDA in crude lipid extracts from the activated neutrophils was detected and quantitated as its PFB oxime derivative. The identification of the PFB oxime of 2-ClHDA from activated neutrophils was achieved by comparison of the mass spectrum and the mass chromatogram retention times with that arising from the synthetic 2-ClHDA standard. The formation of the monochlorinated compounds is highlighted by the observation of the predicted molecular anion pairs at m/z 469/471, the m/z288/290 (M− PFB), and the Cl− ion atm/z 35/37 with abundance ratios of 3:1. Additionally, the 18 carbon α-chloro fatty aldehyde, 2-ClODA, was also observed. The detection of 2-ClODA was expected because thesn-1 aliphatic composition of plasmalogens of neutrophils is enriched with both 16:0 and 18:0 aliphatic groups (39Kayganich K. Murphy R. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 64: 2965-2971Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that the sn-1 vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens can be targeted during neutrophil activation with subsequent production of the α-chloro fatty aldehydes, 2-ClHDA and 2-ClODA. It is likely that α-chloro fatty aldehydes are produced by activated neutrophils through a mechanism that is mediated by myeloperoxidase-derived reactive chlorinating species that target the plasmalogen vinyl ether bond. Myeloperoxidase-derived reactive chlorinating species are produced during neutrophil activation, and the present results show that inhibition of their production by the inclusion of the myeloperoxidase inhibitors azide, cyanide, or 3-aminotriazole drastically attenuates the production of 2-ClHDA in PMA-stimulated neutrophils. It should be noted that our previous studies have demonstrated that the production of α-chloro fatty aldehydes is dependent on the presence of the masked aldehyde at thesn-1 position (vinyl ether bond) of plasmalogens only (26Albert C. Crowley J. Hsu F. Thukkani A. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23733-23741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Specifically, glycerophospholipid species containing ester linkages at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions or free fatty aldehydes themselves do not produce α-chloro fatty aldehydes when treated with myeloperoxidase-derived reactive chlorinating species (26Albert C. Crowley J. Hsu F. Thukkani A. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23733-23741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Given that 2-ClHDA and 2-ClODA are the predominant α-chloro fatty aldehydes produced by PMA-treated neutrophils and neutrophil plasmalogens are highly enriched with 16:0 and 18:0 aliphatic groups at their sn-1 positions respectively (39Kayganich K. Murphy R. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 64: 2965-2971Google Scholar), it is highly likely that that neutrophil plasmalogens are targeted by myeloperoxidase-derived reactive chlorinating species released by activated neutrophils. Although significant changes in plasmalogen content were not detected in crude lipid extracts from control and PMA-treated neutrophil samples, it is unlikely that significant alterations in neutrophil vinyl ether content would be detected given that the mass of α-chloro fatty aldehydes produced from PMA-treated neutrophils is three orders of magnitude less than the total mass of the neutrophil plasmalogen pool. It should be appreciated that, despite the targeting of plasmalogens and production of α-chloro fatty aldehydes, the relative maintenance of neutrophil membrane plasmalogen composition most likely precludes deleterious changes in membrane dynamics and function in the activated neutrophil stemming from altered membrane plasmalogen content. Although fMLP induces significant neutrophil chemotaxis, the possibility that 2-ClHDA itself acts as a neutrophil chemoattractant was investigated. Many different aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxynonenal and 4-hydroxytetradecenal (41Curzio M. Torrielli M. Giroud J. Esterbauer H. Dianzani M. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1982; 36: 463-476PubMed Google Scholar), thought to be produced by lipid peroxidation in the course of inflammatory reactions have been shown to induce significant neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro. 2-ClHDA induced neutrophil chemotactic activity less than that of fMLP, which corroborates with previously reported chemotactic activity induced by other aldehydes in relation to fMLP (41Curzio M. Torrielli M. Giroud J. Esterbauer H. Dianzani M. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1982; 36: 463-476PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the generation of 2-ClHDA by neutrophils might represent a previously unrecognized factor driving ongoing neutrophil recruitment to sites of active inflammation while also lending support to the hypothesis that aldehydic lipid oxidation or peroxidation products play important roles in such mechanisms. The present studies suggest that neutrophils recruited to sites of active inflammation themselves are sources of α-chloro fatty aldehydes. This study also shows that reactive chlorinating species attack plasmalogen pools of neighboring cells (e.g. endothelial cells in the vascular wall). In vivo, activated neutrophils mediating inflammatory reactions are most likely tightly adherent to the targeted endothelial cells. The spatial proximity of neutrophils and endothelial cells during inflammatory reactions likely enhances neutrophil-derived reactive chlorinating species access and targeting of endothelial cell plasmalogens. This should contribute to further production of α-chloro fatty aldehydes and neutrophil recruitment to sites of inflammation. The generation of α-chloro fatty aldehydes may mediate tissue injury by disrupting membrane protein conformation or function by reacting with protein sulfhydryl groups (42Witz G. Lawrie N. Goldstein A. Goldstein B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or by reacting with protein primary amine groups to produce Schiff base adducts (43Hazen S.L. Gaut J.P. Hsu F.F.

Taken together, it is possible that neutrophil-mediated targeting of plasmalogen pools of the cardiovascular system may play an important role in the pathophysiologic sequelae of cardiovascular diseases that are characterized by neutrophil infiltration such as myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (3Hansen P.R. Circulation. 1995; 91: 1872-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 4Vermeiren G. Claeys M. Van Bockstaele D. Grobben B. Slegers H. Bossaert L. Jorens P.

The present study has demonstrated that α-chloro fatty aldehydes are produced in activated neutrophils through a mechanism that is mediated by myeloperoxidase-derived reactive chlorinating species that target the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens. These α-chloro fatty aldehydes may have an important role in the recruitment of neutrophils to sites of inflammation. Addionally, it should be noted that the targeting of plasmalogens by reactive chlorinating species would also produce lysophosphatidylcholine which may mediate a myriad of biological effects in phagocyte-involved diseases (26Albert C.

Taken together, the present results demonstrate the targeting of vinyl ether bonds of plasmalogens in a biological system. This may represent a potentially important and as of yet unrecognized mechanism mediating the generation of α-chloro fatty aldehydes and lysophospholipids which may both play important roles in the pathophysiological sequelae of phagocyte-mediated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1995327987,"The protective roles of sarcolemmal (sarc) and mitochondrial (mito) KATP channels are unclear despite their apparent importance to ischemic preconditioning. We examined these roles by monitoring intracellular calcium ([Ca]int), using fura-2 and fluo-3, in enzymatically isolated rat right ventricular myocytes. Myocyte mortality, estimated using a trypan blue assay, changed approximately in parallel with changes in [Ca]int. Chemically induced hypoxia (CIH), induced by application of cyanide and 2-deoxy-glucose, caused a steady rise in [Ca]int. Calcium increased more rapidly on 'reoxygenation' by return to control solutions. The protein kinase C (PKC) activator PMA abolished both phases of calcium increase. The mitoKATP channel-selective blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate partially prevented the PMA-induced protection during CIH, but not during reoxygenation. In contrast, HMR 1098, a sarcKATP channel-selective blocker, abolished protection only during the reoxygenation. Adenosine (A1) receptor activation prevented or reduced increases in [Ca]int and improved cell viability via a PKC and mito/sarcKATP channel-dependent mechanism. PKC-dependent protection against cytoplasmic calcium increases was also observed in a human cell line (tsA201) transiently expressing sarcKATP channels. Protection was abolished only during the reoxygenation phase by the amino acid substitution (T180A) in the pore-forming Kir6.2 subunit, a mutation previously shown to prevent PKC-dependent modulation. Our data suggest that sarc and mitoKATP channel populations play distinct protective roles, triggered by PKC and/or adenosine, during chemically induced hypoxia/reoxygenation."

We demonstrate that the activity of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is stimulated by LPS activation in J774 macrophages. Inhibition of ILK activity by dominant-negative ILK or a highly selective small molecule ILK inhibitor, in epithelial cells or LPS-stimulated J774 cells and murine macrophages, resulted in inhibition of iNOS expression and NO synthesis. LPS stimulates the phosphorylation of IκB on Ser-32 and promotes its degradation. Inhibition of ILK suppressed this LPS-stimulated IκB phosphorylation and degradation. Similarly, ILK inhibition suppressed the LPS-stimulated iNOS promoter activity. Mutation of the NF-κB sites in the iNOS promoter abolished LPS- and ILK-mediated regulation of iNOS promoter activity. Overexpression of ILK-stimulated NF-κB activity and inhibition of ILK or protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) suppressed this activation. We conclude that ILK can regulate NO production in macrophages by regulating iNOS expression through a pathway involving PKB/Akt and NF-κB. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that ILK activity is required for LPS stimulated cyclooxygenase-2 expression in murine and human macrophages.

Because the transcription factor NF-κB has been shown to be activated by PKB/Akt, which is known to lead to activation of iNOS in mice (7Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether ILK could also regulate NF-κB activity. To examine a physiologically relevant system for the regulation of NF-κB by ILK, we examined the role of ILK in LPS-stimulated expression of iNOS and NO. We found that ILK is an upstream regulator of LPS-mediated phosphorylation of IκB and of NF-κB-dependent expression of iNOS.Mouse and human macrophages have different iNOS promoters (21Zhang X. Laubach V.E. Alley E.W. Edwards K.A. Sherman P.A. Russell S.W. Murphy WJ. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To determine a similar role of NF-κB in human macrophages, we analyzed the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a protein that regulates the production of proinflammatory prostaglandins by catalyzing arachidonic acid into prostaglandins (22Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar, 23Williams C.S. Mann M. DuBois R.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7908-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, which are the products of two different genes. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues and is a housekeeping gene (24Funk C.D. Funk L.B. Kennedy M.E. Pong A.S. Fitzgerald G.A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2304-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar).

We demonstrate here that in addition to regulating iNOS gene expression in an NF-κB-dependent manner, ILK activity is also required for LPS-mediated COX-2 expression in murine and human macrophages.DISCUSSIONThe expression of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase, which catalyzes the production of nitric oxide froml-arginine, is regulated by the transcription factor NF-κB in murine macrophages in response to LPS and cytokines (1MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar). Macrophage-derived NO is an important host defense and microbial and tumor cell killing agent (1MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar), as well as a regulator of proinflammatory genes in vivo. The ability to modulate iNOS expression could potentially control chronic and acute inflammatory diseases; therefore, it is important to understand the regulation of iNOS.In this paper we have provided novel data indicating that the integrin-linked kinase, ILK, which couples integrins and growth factors to downstream signaling pathways (11Dedhar S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), can regulate iNOS expression and NO production in murine macrophages and regulate the expression of a pro-inflammatory protein, COX-2, in both murine and human macrophages. ILK is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent kinase (17Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Ruel L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 18Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Delcommenne M. Troussard A. Sanghera J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) capable of regulating the phosphorylation and activation of PKB/Akt, which has recently been shown to regulate NF-κB activation by activating IκB kinase (8Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar, 9Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that ILK can also regulate NF-κB activation in a physiologically relevant system. Our data indicates that ILK activity is rapidly stimulated in response to LPS in murine macrophages, and this results in the phosphorylation and degradation of Θκβ. Importantly, we have shown here that inhibition of ILK using a specific small molecule inhibitor results in the inhibition of Θκβ phosphorylation on Ser-32 and the prevention of its degradation. In addition, ILK inhibition suppresses LPS-stimulated NF-κB promoter activity as well as iNOS promoter activity and NO production. The inhibition of ILK also inhibits iNOS protein expression. Furthermore, the stable expression of dominant-negative ILK decreased the iNOS expression and NO production in LPS-stimulated J774 cells, and the over-expression of wild-type ILK enhanced iNOS expression and NO production in LPS-stimulated J774 cells.The precise mechanism involved in the regulation of IκB phosphorylation by ILK is not yet clear and is under investigation. A possible mechanism is that ILK is a critical upstream mediator of NF-κB activation through its capacity to regulate PKB/Akt kinase activity by phosphorylating Ser-473 (18Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Delcommenne M. Troussard A. Sanghera J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3207-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In this paper we have demonstrated that ILK-stimulated NF-κB activity is inhibited by dominant-negative PKB/Akt. This implicates PKB/Akt in the ILK regulation of NF-κB.Our data further suggest that ILK may play a pivotal role in the regulation of NO production by coupling integrin and LPS signaling. It has been shown that NO production is significantly stimulated in the presence of integrin activation (61Muller J.M. Chilian W.M. Davis M.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 62Attur M.G. Dave M.N. Clancy R.M. Patel I.R. Abramson S.B. Amin A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2684-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ligation of α5β1 integrin with a specific antibody stimulates NO production (50Schwartz Z. Lohmann C.H. Vocke A.K. Sylivia V.L. Cochran D.L. Dean D.D. Boyan B.D. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 2001; 56: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 61Muller J.M. Chilian W.M. Davis M.J. Circ.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 2684-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because ILK can interact directly with the cytoplasmic domains of integrin β1 and β3 subunits and can couple integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and downstream signaling components such as PKB/Akt (11Dedhar S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), it is likely that the integrin-mediated stimulation of NO involves ILK. Thus ILK appears to be an important mediator of NO production by iNOS in macrophages and may play a role in other cell types such as endothelial cells, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts.Because human and mouse iNOS promoters are very different, we have also demonstrated the role of ILK on inflammatory molecule expression in human macrophages by assessing the expression of COX-2. The LPS-inducible expression of COX-2, also a proinflammatory enzyme, is regulated by NF-κB in both mice and human promoters (28Lee J.Y. Sohn K.H. Rhee S.H. Hwang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16683-16689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 34von Knethen A. Callsen D. Brune B. J.

Chilian W.M. Davis M.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As shown by our results, ILK plays a role in regulating the expression of COX-2 in human macrophages. Because ILK has been shown to regulate transcription factors such as AP-1 and CREB (15Troussard A.A. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16D'Amico M. Hulit J. Amanatullah D.F. Zafonte B.T. Albanese C. Bouzahzah B. Fu M. Augenlicht L.H. Donehower L.A. Takemaru K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32649-32657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), it is probable that ILK could regulate the transcription of COX-2 through an NF-κB-, AP-1-, and/or CREB-dependent manner. Investigations are currently under way to determine the identity of the transcription factors involved in ILK-regulated transcription activity of the COX-2 promoter.Macrophages can produce NO and prostaglandins, which are regulated by the expression of iNOS and COX-2 upon stimulation with LPS. Our results show that inhibiting ILK function using either a small molecule (KP-392) or dominant-negative ILK cDNA can result in the inhibition of NF-κB activity as well as NF-κB-dependent expression of both iNOS and COX-2. These results implicate ILK as a novel player in the regulation of NO and prostaglandin production and suggest that the inhibition of ILK may be of therapeutic benefit in controlling destructive inflammatory processes triggered by NO and COX-2. Mouse macrophages express an inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS),1 which catalyzes the production of nitric oxide (NO) froml-arginine. Macrophage-derived NO is important for host defense and microbial and tumor cell killing (reviewed in Ref. 1MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev.

The distal region (RII, −913 to −1029) functions as an enhancer element and responds to LPS and interferon-γ through NF-κB, interferon regulatory factor-1, interferon-stimulated response element, and γ-interferon activation site binding sites. The NF-κB sites are essential for LPS-mediated NO production (7Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) has been shown to phosphorylate and activate IκB kinase (8Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B.

Phosphorylated IκB is targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, thus releasing active NF-κB and allowing its translocation into the nucleus (10Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is an ankyrin-repeat containing serine/threonine protein kinase that can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the β1 integrin and regulates integrin-dependent functions (11Dedhar S.

Because the transcription factor NF-κB has been shown to be activated by PKB/Akt, which is known to lead to activation of iNOS in mice (7Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether ILK could also regulate NF-κB activity. To examine a physiologically relevant system for the regulation of NF-κB by ILK, we examined the role of ILK in LPS-stimulated expression of iNOS and NO. We found that ILK is an upstream regulator of LPS-mediated phosphorylation of IκB and of NF-κB-dependent expression of iNOS. Mouse and human macrophages have different iNOS promoters (21Zhang X. Laubach V.E. Alley E.W. Edwards K.A. Sherman P.A. Russell S.W. Murphy WJ. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To determine a similar role of NF-κB in human macrophages, we analyzed the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a protein that regulates the production of proinflammatory prostaglandins by catalyzing arachidonic acid into prostaglandins (22Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar, 23Williams C.S. Mann M. DuBois R.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7908-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, which are the products of two different genes. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues and is a housekeeping gene (24Funk C.D. Funk L.B. Kennedy M.E. Pong A.S. Fitzgerald G.A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2304-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). COX-2 is not detectable in most normal tissues or resting immune cells, but cytokines, growth factors, and endotoxins can induce its expression (25Hempel S.L. Monick M.M. Hunnighhake G.W. J. Clin.

The AP-1 and CREB transcription factors, in addition to NF-κB, have been demonstrated to be important in the regulation of COX-2 expression (34von Knethen A. Callsen D. Brune B. J.

We demonstrate here that in addition to regulating iNOS gene expression in an NF-κB-dependent manner, ILK activity is also required for LPS-mediated COX-2 expression in murine and human macrophages. DISCUSSIONThe expression of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase, which catalyzes the production of nitric oxide froml-arginine, is regulated by the transcription factor NF-κB in murine macrophages in response to LPS and cytokines (1MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar). Macrophage-derived NO is an important host defense and microbial and tumor cell killing agent (1MacMicking J. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar), as well as a regulator of proinflammatory genes in vivo. The ability to modulate iNOS expression could potentially control chronic and acute inflammatory diseases; therefore, it is important to understand the regulation of iNOS.In this paper we have provided novel data indicating that the integrin-linked kinase, ILK, which couples integrins and growth factors to downstream signaling pathways (11Dedhar S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), can regulate iNOS expression and NO production in murine macrophages and regulate the expression of a pro-inflammatory protein, COX-2, in both murine and human macrophages. ILK is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent kinase (17Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Ruel L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) capable of regulating the phosphorylation and activation of PKB/Akt, which has recently been shown to regulate NF-κB activation by activating IκB kinase (8Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar, 9Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that ILK can also regulate NF-κB activation in a physiologically relevant system. Our data indicates that ILK activity is rapidly stimulated in response to LPS in murine macrophages, and this results in the phosphorylation and degradation of Θκβ. Importantly, we have shown here that inhibition of ILK using a specific small molecule inhibitor results in the inhibition of Θκβ phosphorylation on Ser-32 and the prevention of its degradation. In addition, ILK inhibition suppresses LPS-stimulated NF-κB promoter activity as well as iNOS promoter activity and NO production. The inhibition of ILK also inhibits iNOS protein expression. Furthermore, the stable expression of dominant-negative ILK decreased the iNOS expression and NO production in LPS-stimulated J774 cells, and the over-expression of wild-type ILK enhanced iNOS expression and NO production in LPS-stimulated J774 cells.The precise mechanism involved in the regulation of IκB phosphorylation by ILK is not yet clear and is under investigation. A possible mechanism is that ILK is a critical upstream mediator of NF-κB activation through its capacity to regulate PKB/Akt kinase activity by phosphorylating Ser-473 (18Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Delcommenne M. Troussard A. Sanghera J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3207-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In this paper we have demonstrated that ILK-stimulated NF-κB activity is inhibited by dominant-negative PKB/Akt. This implicates PKB/Akt in the ILK regulation of NF-κB.Our data further suggest that ILK may play a pivotal role in the regulation of NO production by coupling integrin and LPS signaling. It has been shown that NO production is significantly stimulated in the presence of integrin activation (61Muller J.M. Chilian W.M. Davis M.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 62Attur M.G. Dave M.N. Clancy R.M. Patel I.R. Abramson S.B. Amin A.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2684-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ligation of α5β1 integrin with a specific antibody stimulates NO production (50Schwartz Z. Lohmann C.H.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 2684-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because ILK can interact directly with the cytoplasmic domains of integrin β1 and β3 subunits and can couple integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and downstream signaling components such as PKB/Akt (11Dedhar S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), it is likely that the integrin-mediated stimulation of NO involves ILK. Thus ILK appears to be an important mediator of NO production by iNOS in macrophages and may play a role in other cell types such as endothelial cells, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts.Because human and mouse iNOS promoters are very different, we have also demonstrated the role of ILK on inflammatory molecule expression in human macrophages by assessing the expression of COX-2. The LPS-inducible expression of COX-2, also a proinflammatory enzyme, is regulated by NF-κB in both mice and human promoters (28Lee J.Y. Sohn K.H. Rhee S.H. Hwang D. J. Biol.

These results implicate ILK as a novel player in the regulation of NO and prostaglandin production and suggest that the inhibition of ILK may be of therapeutic benefit in controlling destructive inflammatory processes triggered by NO and COX-2.

A complete inhibition of transport by Cu(II)(1,10-phenanthroline)3 is observed in the double mutants A412C/V427C and A364C/S440C, but not in the corresponding single mutants. No inhibition is observed in more then 20 other double cysteine mutants. The Cu(II)(1,10-phenanthroline)3 inhibition can be partly prevented by the nontransportable glutamate analogue dihydrokainate. Treatment with dithiothreitol restores much of the transport activity. Moreover, micromolar concentrations of cadmium ions reversibly inhibit transport catalyzed by A412C/V427C and A364C/S440C double mutants, but not by the corresponding single mutants. Inhibition by Cu(II)(1,10-phenanthroline)3 and by cadmium is only observed when the cysteine pairs are introduced in the same polypeptide. Therefore, in both cases the proximity appears to be intra- rather than intermolecular. Positions 364 and 440 are located on reentrant loop I and II, respectively. Our results suggest that these two loops, previously shown to be essential for glutamate transport, come in close proximity.

The homology is significantly higher in the carboxyl-terminal half of the transporters. Topology studies suggest that this region of the protein has an intriguing arrangement, containing two oppositely oriented reentrant loops, transmembrane domains (TM)1 7 and 8, as well as an outward facing hydrophobic region (Refs. 23Grunewald M.

Several amino acid residues critical for the function of glutamate transporters are located in the carboxyl-terminal half. Two adjacent amino acid residues of GLT-1, Tyr-403 and Glu-404, are located in TM7 and are conserved in all other glutamate transporters. Both were implicated in the binding of potassium ions (16Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A conserved arginine residue, Arg-477 in GLT-1, is located in TM8 and has been shown to play a pivotal role in the sequential interaction of the transporters with amino acid substrates and with the potassium ion (28Bendahan A. Armon A. Madani N. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Accessibility studies have shown that cysteine residues introduced at positions 364 and 440 of GLT-1, located on reentrant loops I and II, respectively, react with the impermeant sulfhydryl reagent MTSET added from the extracellular side (24Slotboom D.J.

Therefore, we have suggested that positions 364 and 440 may be close in the three-dimensional structure of the protein (25Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To verify this prediction and to obtain the first information regarding the tertiary structure of the carboxyl-terminal half of the glutamate transporters, we have set out to determine proximity relationships between the different structural elements in this region. In this study, we have used two types of functional assays to infer proximity of engineered cysteine pairs. We report here the identification of two cysteine pairs, A412C/V427C and A364C/S440C, which behave as if they are close in space. The data provide evidence that the two oppositely oriented reentrant loops are spatially close to one another. Specific oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation and an engineered restriction site were synthesized. One or two primers were used to introduce single or double mutations on uracil-containing single-stranded DNA derived from wild type GLT-1 (WT-GLT-1) or cysteine-less GLT-1 (CL-GLT-1) constructs (30Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar, 31Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mutated clones were selected using the engineered restriction site(s) as a diagnostic tool. The fragment of GLT-1 containing the mutation(s) was then subcloned into WT- or CL-GLT-1 using unique restriction sites flanking the mutation(s), and the mutated constructs were sequenced in both directions between these unique sites. Uptake assays usingd-3[H]aspartic acid were carried out essentially as described (31Pines G. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17093-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were cultured in 24-well plates, transfected with the indicated GLT-1 construct, and infected with the vaccinia/T7 virus vTF7–3(32Fuerst R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc.

After 16–20 h, the cells were washed twice with choline solution (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm choline chloride, 0.5 mm magnesium sulfate, and 0.3 mm calcium chloride). Next, the cells were preincubated with the indicated solution for 5 min at room temperature. Following a brief wash with the choline solution, a sodium solution (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.5 mm magnesium sulfate, 0.3 mmcalcium chloride) supplemented with 0.4 μCi of the radiolabeledd-aspartic acid (18–21 Ci/mol, Amersham Biosciences, Inc. or PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added and the uptake was carried out for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold sodium solution and lysed with 1% SDS solution for scintillation counting. For oxidation studies, the preincubation solution contained 100 μmCu(II)(1,10-phenanthroline)3 (CuPh) (or the indicated concentration). The CuPh stock solution (150 mm) was prepared for each experiment by mixing 0.4 ml of 1.25 m1,10-phenanthroline in water:ethanol (1:1) and 0.6 ml of 250 mm CuSO4. The experiments depicted in the figures were performed at least three times (n ≥ 3), and values within a given experiment were the mean of triplicate or quadruplicate determinations. The values presented in the Figs. are the mean ± S.D. of the several experiments. Statistical analysis of the data was done using the Student's t test with α = 0.01. Statistically significant differences (with p< 0.001) are marked with asterisks in Figs. 2, 3, and6.Figure 3Effect of CuPh on the activity of single cysteine mutants. For each of the double cysteine mutants, A412C/V4127C (A) and A364C/S440C (B), we constructed the individual corresponding cysteine mutations in the WT-GLT-1 background. Co-expression of two single cysteine mutants in HeLa cells is marked by “co.” Whole cell uptake was measured in the absence (black bars) and in the presence (white bars) of 100 μmCuPh.

The pioneering studies of Kaback and co-workers (33Sun J. Kemp C.R. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8020-8026Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) to detect proximity relationships in lactose permease were based on creating, under oxidative conditions, a disulfide bond between two single cysteines, each located at a different TM domain or connecting loop. Cross-linking of two cysteines can be easily detected when each is located on a different part of a split transporter (33Sun J. Kemp C.R. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8020-8026Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 34Bibi E. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4325-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We have made unsuccessful attempts to generate a functional split GLT-1 transporter (25Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Molecular engineering of artificial protease-sensitive sites in GLT-1, with the aim to obtain physical evidence of cross-linking of engineered cysteines, led to inactivation of the transporter (data not shown). Therefore, we have employed a functional assay to study proximity relationships. Based on the well established observation that GLT-1 undergoes extensive conformational changes during transport (35Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17017-17024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we reasoned that introduction of a covalent disulfide bridge may hamper these changes, leading to inhibition of transport. To increase the likelihood to detect proximal pairs of cysteines, we started our study with positions where introduced cysteines are accessible to the impermeant hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagent MTSET. Such positions are presumably facing a water-filled cavity in the transporter, possibly the permeation pathway. The positions selected for the screen are shown in Fig.1. These include: Ala-364 (reentrant loop I; Ref. 25Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Pairs of cysteines were introduced in many combinations in the WT-GLT-1, and the double mutants were expressed in HeLa cells. Transport of the nonmetabolizable substrated-[3H]aspartate was assayed with and without preincubation with the oxidizing agent CuPh. Some of the most significant results are depicted in Fig.2. Although WT-GLT-1 contains nine endogenous cysteine residues (see Fig. 1), its activity is only slightly decreased upon exposure to 100 μm CuPh. Two double cysteine mutants, A412C/V427C and A364C/S440C, completely lose their activity under the same conditions. Significantly, other combinations of cysteine pairs among these four positions do not lead to an increased sensitivity of the double mutants to oxidizing conditions (Fig. 2). Moreover, pairing of A412C, V427V, A364C, or S440C with a cysteine residue introduced at position 469 in TM8 results in CuPh-insensitive double mutants. Uptake activity of additional double cysteine mutants is also not affected by CuPh treatment (see legend to Fig. 2). Although most of the double cysteine mutants retain at least 50% transport activity compared with WT-GLT-1, two (A364C/S440C and A364C/V469C) show ∼20% of WT activity (Fig. 2). Analysis of the kinetic properties of the A364C/S440C transporter shows that the decrease of activity is the result of a lowering ofVmax (1.2 ± 0.6 compared with 4.7 ± 0.5 nmol/mg of protein/min for WT-GLT-1) (n = 3). The apparent Km is not significantly changed (34 ± 6 μm compared with 38 ± 2 μm for the WT-GLT-1). Thus, the conformation of the double mutant is not altered, at least regarding its substrate affinity. It is of interest to note that, in the case of the two double mutants which are inhibited by CuPh, A412C/V427C and A364C/S440C, the observed activity is lower than what would be expected from the independent impact of the single mutants. Thus, A364C and S440C exhibit 71 ± 9% (n = 5) and 56 ± 13% (n = 7) of WT-GLT-1 activity (Fig.3A). However, the observed activity of A364C/S440C is only 18 ± 3% (n = 8). The same is found for A412C/V427C, which has 48 ± 6% (n = 5) of the wild type activity (Fig. 2), whereas A412C and V427C exhibit 96 ± 7% and 83 ± 1% (n = 4) of the wild type, respectively (Fig.3B). Because the double mutants were constructed in the WT-GLT-1 background, it is possible that the oxidation of A412C/V427C and A364C/S440C double mutants leads to the cross-linking of one of the newly introduced cysteines with an endogenous cysteine residue. To investigate this possibility, the two cysteine pairs were introduced in the background of CL-GLT-1, where all nine endogenous cysteines have been removed (23Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 36Zarbiv R. Grunewald M. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14231-14237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, we could not analyze the effect of CuPh on the double mutants, because they are completely devoid of activity (Fig. 4). The single cysteine mutants in this background are active (Fig. 4). Surface biotinylation experiments indicate that this is probably a result of the fact that these double mutant transporters do not reach the plasma membrane (data not shown). In view of this result, we have continued to characterize the structural determinants leading to the loss of activity caused by oxidative conditions in the wild type background. None of the single mutants A412C, V427C, A364C, or S440C in the WT-GLT-1 background are sensitive to the oxidizing conditions (Fig. 3, A andB). Moreover, transport activity of the 412C/V427A and A412S/V427C mutants is not significantly inhibited by CuPh, as opposed to the A412C/V427C mutant (Fig. 3A). The same is shown for A364S/S440C and A364C/S440A mutants (Fig. 3B). These observations render highly unlikely the possibility that perturbation of one of the positions causes a conformational change bringing an endogenous cysteine close to one of the introduced ones. The formation of a disulfide bond between proximal cysteines induced by CuPh would be expected to be reversed by a reducing agent such as DTT, provided it can reach the dithiol bond. Indeed, transport activity of both A412C/V427C and A364C/S440C previously treated with CuPh was significantly restored upon exposure to 12 mm DTT (Fig.5). This concentration of DTT is similar to that used to reverse the inhibition of serotonin transporter mutants by methanethiosulfonate reagents (37Chen J.-G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that glutamate transporters may form oligomers (38Haugeto O. Ullensvang K. Levy L.M. Chaudry F.A. Honoré T. Nielsen M. Lehre K.P. Danbolt N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27715-27722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 39Eskandari S. Kreman M. Kavanaugh M.P. Wright E.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 95: 8641-8646Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar), although it is still unclear if the monomer or the oligomer is the functional unit. Therefore, the oxidative cross-linking inferred for the two cysteine pairs may be intermolecular rather than intramolecular. Our results do not support this possibility. When the single mutants A412C and V427C are coexpressed in HeLa cells, no inhibition of transport activity by CuPh is observed. On the other hand, when both mutations are present on the same cDNA molecule, a potent inhibition by CuPh is observed (Fig. 3A). The same is observed for A364C and S440C (Fig. 3B). When the substrate analogue DHK is present during the oxidative treatment, 6- and 2.5-fold protection is observed with A412C/V427C and A364C/S440C, respectively (Fig. 6). The substrate l-glutamate has a 3-fold protective effect on A412C/V427C, whereas GABA, which is not a substrate, does not protect. In A364C/S440C, the protective effect of l-glutamate is smaller but statistically significant (Fig. 6). Replacement of the other cosubstrate (sodium) by choline, has no effect on inhibition by CuPh (data not shown). As a complementary approach to establish the proximity between cysteines introduced at positions 412 and 427 as well as between those at positions 364 and 440, we have examined the ability of the double mutants to form a high affinity Cd2+ binding site. This divalent cation interacts with cysteinyl side chains (40Perez-Garcia M.T. Chiamvimonvat N. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 41Glusker J.P. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 1-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the affinity of the interaction is dramatically increased if the Cd2+ ion can be coordinated by two cysteines (42Bénitah J.-P.

Exposure of the WT-GLT-1 to up to 100 μm Cd2+ has no significant effect ond-[3H]aspartate transport (Fig.7A). The single cysteine mutants are also unaffected by this treatment (Fig. 7A). On the other hand, the activity of the A412C/V427C double mutant is inhibited to ∼50% at 100 μm Cd2+ (Fig.7A). The activity of the A364C/S440C double mutant is dramatically more sensitive to the divalent cation. Half-maximal inhibition is attained at ∼0.5 μm and total inhibition at ∼10 μm Cd2+. In both double mutants, a partial reversal of this inhibition is observed when the Cd2+ ions are washed away (data not shown). It is of interest to note that the A364C/S440C transporter is also more sensitive to CuPh as compared with A412C/V427C (Fig. 7B), although the difference is not as dramatic as that observed with Cd2+. We have examined the impact of CuPh and Cd2+ on the kinetics of the double mutant transporters. Transfected cells were treated with appropriate concentrations of these reagents to achieve 50–70% inhibition of transport. Because of the relative low transport rate of A364C/S440C, no reliable data could be obtained for this double mutant. However, analysis of cells expressing the A412C/V427C double mutant pre-incubated with 3 μm CuPh results in a Vmax of 26–40% of untreated controls, whereas the Km remains essentially the same −40.0 ± 1.6 μmcompared with 38.1 ± 3.1 μm for untreated controls (n = 3). Similarly, treatment of cells expressing A412C/V427C with 100 μmCd2+ results in a Vmax of 50–55% of untreated controls, whereas the Km remains essentially unchanged −37.7 ± 0.7 μm(n = 2). The results described in this paper provide the first information on distance constraints in the (Na+ + K+)-coupled glutamate transporters. We have identified two cysteine pairs, A412C/V427C and A364C/S440C, which appear to be close in space. We have used two functional assays to infer proximity relationships between the engineered cysteine pairs. One assay (Figs. 2and 3) is based on the observation that extensive conformational changes take place during glutamate transport (35Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17017-17024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and the idea that formation of disulfide bonds could hamper them. This idea is supported by our observations that CuPh impacts Vmaxrather than Km of A412C/V427C, indicating that its effect is the result of the inactivation of modified transporters. CuPh treatment of other transporters, containing two engineered proximal cysteines, has also been shown to impair function (43Kim Y.-M. Ye L. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36681-36686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 44Wu J. Kaback H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In some transporters and pumps, the cross-linking of the intact molecule has been shown to result in a gel-shift (45Santacruz-Toloza L. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 46Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have attempted this experiment, but could not observe a change in mobility on SDS-PAGE upon treatment with CuPh (data not shown). This is probably a result of the fact that our observed functional impact represents inactivation of surface transporters. In the vaccinia/T7 virus expression system employed, these are only a small fraction of the total protein pool made in the HeLa cells. Thus, the system used in our studies is not optimal for the detection of surface-directed cross-linking. The second functional assay is based on the creation of a high affinity Cd2+ binding site between vicinal cysteines (Fig.7A). Engineering of artificial high affinity Zn2+ binding sites has recently been used to define proximity relationships in the dopamine transporter (47Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.D. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 48Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of Zn2+ on the dopamine transporter was primarily the result of a decrease in Vmax (47Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.D. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Similar effects of Zn2+ have recently been observed with the GABA transporter GAT-1 (49MacAulay N. Bendahan A. Loland C.J. Zeuthen T. Kanner B.I. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40476-40485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with our results on Cd2+ inhibition of A412C/V427C, whereVmax is selectively reduced. Although it has been reported that the affinity of the interaction with Cd2+ is increased even when the binding site is coordinated by two cysteines (42Bénitah J.-P. Tomaselli G.F. Marban E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7392-7396Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), three cysteines have been implicated for high affinity Cd2+ binding in another system (50Loussouarn G. Makhina E.N. Rose T. Nichols C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the markedly higher Cd2+ sensitivity of A364C/S440C compared with A412C/V427C can result from the contribution of an additional (yet unknown) contact site within the A364C/S440C transporter, similar to the finding with the zinc sensitivity studies of the dopamine transporters (48Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Another explanation for the higher Cd2+ sensitivity of A364C/S440C relative to A412C/V427C is the possibility that the bond angles of the former are more conducive to Cd2+ binding than the latter. Alternatively, positions 364 and 440 may be closer to each other than the other pair. Consistent with this option is the higher CuPh sensitivity of A364C/S440C compared with A412C/V427C (Fig. 7B). The activity of the two double cysteine mutants compared with their single counterparts suggests that the impact of the individual mutations is not simply additive (Fig. 3). This is seen even more dramatically in the cysteine-less background (Fig. 4). In the latter case, it appears that the double cysteine transporters do not reach the plasma membrane, consistent with our inability to observe activity in these mutants after exposure of the cells (or reconstituted preparations derived of them) to DTT (data not shown). One possibility is that a disulfide bridge between the two cysteines is generated because of the oxidative environment of the endoplasmic reticulum, thus preventing their arrival or maintenance at the plasma membrane. The presence of one or more of the endogenous cysteines of GLT-1 somehow moderates this phenomenon (Figs. 3 and 4). We have attempted to see whether the distance of the two pairs is changing as a function of the conformation of the transporter. For both pairs we have observed a significant protection of inactivation by CuPh by the nontransportable blocker DHK (Fig. 6). However, the interpretation of this result is not straightforward, because DHK may restrict the accessibility of the oxidizing agent required for disulfide formation, rather than affect the distance between the two cysteines. In fact DHK has been shown to protect the A364C and S440C transporters against inactivation by methanethiosulfonate reagents (25Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,29Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This issue must await future experimentation to distinguish between the two possibilities. The observation that position 412 at the top of TM7 (Fig. 1; Refs.23Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 24Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) is close to position 427 (Figs. 2, 3, and 7), located at the middle of the descending limb of reentrant loop II, enables us to refine the topological model of GLT-1 (Fig.8). Position 427 is apparently located close to the top of TM7. Therefore, reentrant loop II needs to be drawn more extracellularly and residues 412–427 probably are all extracellular, and position 431 probably reaches only halfway through the membrane bilayer. Because a cysteine introduced at position 431 is accessible to the bulky biotinylated sulfhydryl reagent 3-N-maleimidyl(propionyl)biocytin from the inside (23Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), it appears that there is a wide vestibule from the cytoplasm, which reaches the apex of reentrant loop II. Engineering of additional cysteine pairs may help to further define the tertiary structure of GLT-1. As schematically illustrated in Fig. 8, it is of special interest that positions 364 and 440, each located on an oppositely reentrant loop, appear to be close in space (Figs. 2, 3, and 7). Proximity of two reentrant loops of opposite orientation has been observed in water and glycerol channels (51Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heyman J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 52Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J.W. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). In the water channel aquaporin 1 and the glycerol facilitator glpF, these reentrant loops line the permeability pathway. Even though the precise molecular details appear to be somewhat different, our results suggest that this may be true also for glutamate transporters. Consistent with this idea are our observations that the nontransportable glutamate analogue DHK protects the single mutants A412C, V427C, A364C, and S440C against modification by MTSET (25Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 29Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).2 Moreover, DHK also reduces the cross-linking mediated by CuPh (Fig. 6). Glutamate itself has a smaller protective effect than DHK (Fig. 6), but this is not unreasonable because it was transported and would therefore occupy the binding site for a shorter time. Defining the interfaces between the two reentrant loops by identification of other cysteine pairs may shed more light on the molecular mechanism of glutamate transport. Glutamate transporters form multimers (38Haugeto O. Ullensvang K. Levy L.M. Chaudry F.A. Honoré T. Nielsen M. Lehre K.P. Danbolt N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27715-27722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 39Eskandari S. Kreman M. Kavanaugh M.P. Wright E.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 95: 8641-8646Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar), possibly pentamers, and permeation of the glutamate anion does not follow the same pathway as that of the uncoupled chloride flux (53Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that chloride passes through the space between the monomers and glutamate is translocated through the monomer itself (39Eskandari S. Kreman M. Kavanaugh M.P. Wright E.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 95: 8641-8646Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Using the approach initiated here, it should be possible to test this idea in the future on glutamate transporters that have higher expression levels in oocytes than GLT-1. Cross-linking of yet unidentified cysteine pairs would be expected to selectively block the chloride conductance, whereas that of others might hamper coupled transport alone.

MDC-L (ADAM 28), a member of the ADAM (adisintegrinand metalloprotease) protein family, is expressed on the surface of human lymphocytes. ADAMs possess a disintegrin-like domain similar in sequence to small non-enzymatic snake venom peptides that act as integrin antagonists. We report here that the disintegrin domain of MDC-L is recognized by the leukocyte integrin α4β1. Recombinant Fc fusion proteins possessing the disintegrin domain of MDC-L supported adhesion of the T-lymphoma cell line, Jurkat, in a concentration- and divalent cation-dependent manner. Adhesion of Jurkat cells to the disintegrin domain of MDC-L was inhibited by an anti-MDC-L monoclonal antibody (mAb), Dis1-1. The epitope for mAb Dis1-1 was localized within 59 residues of the disintegrin domain. Recombinant expression of this 59-residue fragment of the disintegrin domain also supported cell adhesion. Adhesion of Jurkat cells to the MDC-L disintegrin domain was specifically inhibited by anti-α4 and anti-β1 function-blocking mAbs. Furthermore, adhesion of various cell lines to MDC-L correlated with expression of the integrin α4-subunit. Transfected K562 cells expressing α4β1 adhered to the disintegrin domain in contrast to non-transfected K562 cells. We further investigated the binding of recombinant MDC-L disintegrin domain (rDis-Fc) in solution. The rDis-Fc was found to bind to Jurkat cells in solution in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner. Both adhesion and solution binding of rDis-Fc was inhibited by the α4β1 ligand mimetic CS-1 peptide. Additionally, recognition of the MDC-L disintegrin domain required “activation” of lymphocyte β1 integrins. The interaction of MDC-L with α4β1 may potentially regulate metalloprotease function by targeting or sequestering the active protease on the cell surface.

Prototypical members of this family are composed of a prodomain, metalloprotease, disintegrin-like, cysteine-rich, EGF-like, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. The metalloprotease domain is homologous to the reprolysins, members of the metazincin superfamily that include the matrix metalloproteases, the astacins, and serralysins (3Stocker W. Grams F.

In addition to the proteolytic functions mentioned, several ADAMs have been shown to interact with the integrin family of cell surface receptors. Integrins are a widely distributed superfamily of noncovalent heterodimeric glycoproteins that play a vital role in cellular adhesion, migration, and signal transduction (14Harris E.S. McIntyre T.M.

The ADAM disintegrin-like domains are homologous to small non-enzymatic peptides isolated from the venom of snakes that function as antagonists of integrins (16Gould R.J. Polokoff M.A. Friedman P.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29251-29259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Howard L. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). MDC-L is predominantly expressed on the surface of human lymphocytes (31Roberts C.M. Tani P.H. Bridges L.C. Laszik Z. Bowditch R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29251-29259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); however, others have also reported expression within mouse epididymis (32Howard L. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The metalloprotease domain of MDC-L possesses catalytic activity, as demonstrated by the ability of MDC-L to cleave the substrate myelin basic protein (33Howard L. Zheng Y. Horrocks M. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The MDC-L metalloprotease also appears to be involved in the proteolytic processing of its prodomain (32Howard L. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, the physiological substrate for the MDC-L metalloprotease has not been identified. Furthermore, the adhesive properties of MDC-L have not been investigated. To shed light on the function of MDC-L expressed on the surface of lymphocytes, we sought to determine whether the disintegrin domain of MDC-L supported cell adhesion. Leukocytes express a variety of integrins, including the highly expressed members of the β2 integrin family and α4β1 (14Harris E.S. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23409-23412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The integrin α4β1 is predominantly expressed by leukocytes and is involved in embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, and the immune and inflammatory responses. Ligands for α4β1 include the alternatively spliced connecting segment of fibronectin (CS-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) (34Humphries M.J. Komoriya A. Akiyama S.K. Olden K.

Similar to several other members of the integrin family, α4β1 is able to adapt multiple conformations resulting in affinity modulation, “activation,” of the integrin (42Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J.

We report here that the disintegrin-like domain of MDC-L is recognized by α4β1 in an activation-dependent manner. The interaction of MDC-L with α4β1 suggests a role in lymphocyte-leukocyte adhesion and localization of the active metalloprotease.

Faull, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia. Recombinantly expressed fibronectin 3fn9–10 module was produced as described (46Kauf A.C.W. Hough S.M. Bowditch R.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9159-9166Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The CS-1 (EILDVPST) and RGDS (KTGRGDSP) peptides were purchased from American Peptide Co., Inc., Sunnyvale, CA. The cyclic MDC-L disintegrin loop peptide (KGGVCRPAKDECDL) was synthesized by the Molecular Biology Resource Facility at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. Soluble VCAM-1 was purchased from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. All chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Jurkat, Daudi, K562, and HepG2 cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA. The Jurkat and Daudi cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640, containing 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The HepG2, a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, was maintained in Eagle's modified essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The α4-transfected K562 cell line was a generous gift from Dr. R. Isberg, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA (47Krukonis E.S. Dersch P. Eble J.A. Isberg R.R. J. Biol.

CHO and K562 cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1%l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Hybridoma cell lines were generated at the Hybridoma Center for Agriculture and Biological Sciences at Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK. MDC-L disintegrin-like domain and EGF-like domain maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins were produced as described (31Roberts C.M. Tani P.H. Bridges L.C. Laszik Z. Bowditch R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29251-29259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The purified MDC-L fusion proteins were mixed and used as immunogens. Supernatants from the hybridomas grown in selective media were first assayed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for immunoglobulins that reacted with either disintegrin-like domain MBP fusion protein or EGF-like domain MBP fusion protein (48Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Supernatants positive for both proteins were considered to be against MBP and not pursued. Positive supernatants were then subjected to a second ELISA screen using rDis/EGF-Fc-coated microtiter well plates. Two hybridomas, designated Dis1-1 and EGF 1–2 based on their initial reactivity, were subcloned until clonal. These antibodies were produced in serum-free culture and purified on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Both mAbs were of the IgG1 κ isotype (Mouse Ig Screening Kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Manipulation of recombinant DNA was by standard techniques (49Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Taq polymerase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Molecular Biology Resource Facility at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. The rDis-Fc and rDis/EGF-Fc constructs were expressed using the Insect Select System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). First, cDNA encoding MDC-L residues Thr407–His664 with uniqueXbaI and BglII sites on the ends was generated by PCR, and the product was subcloned intoXbaI/BglII-digested baculovirus cloning vector pAc-GP67 (BD PharMingen) to fuse the GP67 signal sequence to the amino terminus of the MDC-L protein sequence. The cDNA encoding the heavy chain Fc region of human IgG3 was subcloned from a lymph node cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by PCR using gene-specific primers. The isolated IgG3heavy chain Fc (starting at residue Ala130) lacking the hinge region was then fused in frame to the carboxyl-terminal end of the GP67-MDC-L cDNA at residue His664 (rDis/EGF-Fc) or residue Gly500 (rDis-Fc) by PCR overlap extension (50Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar, 51Kadowaki H. Kadowaki T. Wondisford F.E. Taylor S.I. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 76: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The PCR products encoding the GP67-MDC-L-Fc constructs were then subcloned into the TOPO pIB/V5-His vector (Invitrogen). The sequence of all constructs was verified by complete nucleotide sequencing of both strands. The pIB-rDis-Fc and pIB-rDis/EGF-Fc vectors were then used to transfect High Five cells using Insect PlusTM Liposome (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were selected in media containing blasticidin. Recombinant protein was purified from the conditioned media by polyethylene glycol concentration and purification on protein G-Sepharose. The fusion proteins were eluted from the protein G-Sepharose in 100 mm citric acid, pH 3.0, and immediately neutralized by addition of 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 9.0. Purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the amino acid composition of secreted rDis-Fc was consistent with the amino terminus having the sequence N′-ADPGYLLD from the GP67 secretion signal fused to the amino terminus of the MDC-L disintegrin-like domain starting at residue Thr407. The hexahistidine MDC-L disintegrin domain rDis (residues Ser406–Gly500) and MiniDis (residues Gly418–Glu476) fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli using the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). DNA encoding the human MDC-L DNA was PCR-amplified using primers that created novel BamHI andHindIII sites and then subcloning theBamHI/HindIII-digested PCR product intoBamHI/HindIII digest pQE30. The ligated DNA was used to transform E. coli M15[pREP4]. The correct coding sequence was verified by nucleotide sequencing of the insert in the plasmid. Cells harboring the pQE30 disintegrin-like domain plasmids were grown, and recombinant protein expression was induced as described (46Kauf A.C.W. Hough S.M. Bowditch R.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9159-9166Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was disrupted in lysis buffer (8 murea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0), centrifuged at 11,000 ×g for 20 min at RT, and the supernatant subjected to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography. The column was washed in lysis buffer at pH 6.3, and bound protein was eluted in lysis buffer, pH 6.3, containing 100 mm EDTA. The recombinant protein was then subjected to rapid dialysis in PBS. The purified fusion proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE, and the correct amino acid composition was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry. For production of alanine substitution mutants at positions Glu471 and Asp473, the Quick Change Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was employed. After verification of the expected mutation by complete nucleotide sequencing of the rDis-Fc coding region, High Five cells were transfected, and recombinant protein was purified and analyzed as described above. The assays for cell adhesion to immobilized substrates were based on that described for adhesion to fibronectin (52Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Immulon-2 96-well plates (Dynatech Laboratories, Inc. Chantilly, VA) were coated with the designated protein at various concentrations in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.4, overnight at 4 °C. The wells were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.4, at RT for 2 h. Cells were prepared by washing three times in HEPES Tyrode's buffer (5 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 2.6 mm KCl, 5 mm d-glucose, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMnCl2). The washed cells were resuspended in the HEPES Tyrode's buffer, and 100-μl aliquots were added to the wells. Where indicated, the inhibitors or stimuli were diluted in HEPES Tyrode's buffer and mixed with the cells just prior to addition to the wells. Cells were allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The wells were gently washed three times with HEPES-Tyrode's buffer to remove non-adherent cells. The remaining adherent cells were visually examined and quantitated by colorimetric analysis using endogenous cellular acid phosphatase by incubating 1 h at 37 °C in 100 μl of 1% Triton X-100, 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.0, 6 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The wells were developed by addition of 50 μl/well of 1 nNaOH and then read in a plate reader at 405 nm. The number of adherent cells was determined from a standard curve generated using known numbers of the same cells. Cells were washed twice in modified Tyrode's (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 2.6 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmCaCl2) with or without 1 mm MnCl2. Cells (5 × 105) were incubated in the presence or absence of inhibitors with the specified concentrations of rDis-Fc in a 200-μl volume at RT for 30 min and then fixed with 0.37% formalin. The cells were then washed 3 times in modified Tyrode's buffer and incubated with 10 μg/ml goat anti-human IgG Fc-specific FITC-conjugated antibody (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 15 min at RT. The cells were again washed 3 times in modified Tyrode's buffer, and fluorescence was analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). ELISAs were based on standard methods (48Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were diluted in 0.1 mNaHCO3, pH 8.4, and Immulon-2 96-well plates coated at 5 μg/ml. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 2% blotto in PBS. The wells were washed 3 times in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and 50 μl of mAbs Dis1-1 or EGF 1–2 diluted in PBS to 1 μg/ml were added. After washing the plates in PBS/Tween, goat anti-mouse biotin-conjugated antibody (Pierce) was then added 1:5000 dilution in PBS. The plates were again washed, and bound biotinylated immunoglobulin was detected by incubation with avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and developed usingo-phenylenediamine. Analysis of α4β1 expression on transfected K562 cells was performed with FITC-conjugated anti-human CD49d mAb 1382f (Chemicon International) in PBS. Sequence alignments were performed using Vector NTI Align X software (InforMax, Bethesda, MD). Lymphocyte-cell interactions, including those with other lymphocytes, are critical for normal immune surveillance and regulation of the immune response. The lymphocyte-expressed protein MDC-L (ADAM 28) is a member of the ADAM family of metalloproteases that possess disintegrin-like domains postulated to act as integrin ligands. To investigate whether membrane-associated MDC-L is capable of interacting with leukocyte adhesion receptors, a recombinant Fc-fusion protein (rDis/EGF-Fc) lacking the metalloprotease and cytoplasmic regions (Fig. 1a) was expressed and examined for the ability to support adhesion of a T-lymphoma cell line. Due to the extensive number of disulfide bonds predicted to exist within the disintegrin-like and other domains of MDC-L, the recombinant proteins were produced using transfected insect cell lines so that proper folding and appropriate disulfide bonds would be expected to occur during secretion. The purified rDis/EGF-Fc protein, which migrated as a single monomeric band on SDS-PAGE under non-reduced conditions (Fig. 1b), supported adhesion of Jurkat cells in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner (Fig. 1c).

https://openalex.org/W2042273549,"We have recently reported that albumin, a serum protein present in the developing brain, stimulates the synthesis of oleic acid by astrocytes, which promotes neuronal differentiation. In this work, we gain insight into the mechanism by which albumin induces the synthesis of this neurotrophic factor. Our results show that astrocytes internalize albumin in vesicle-like structures by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Albumin uptake was followed by transcytosis, including passage through the endoplasmic reticulum, which was required to induce the synthesis of oleic acid. Oleic acid synthesis is feedback-regulated by the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, which induces the transcription of stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase, the key rate-limiting enzyme for oleic acid synthesis. In our research, the presence of albumin activated the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and increased stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase mRNA. Moreover, when the activity of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 was inhibited by overexpression of a truncated form of this protein, albumin did not affect stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase mRNA, indicating that the effect of albumin is mediated by this transcription factor. The effect of albumin was abolished when traffic to the endoplasmic reticulum was prevented or when albumin was accompanied with oleic acid. In conclusion, our results suggest that the transcytosis of albumin includes passage through the endoplasmic reticulum, where oleic acid is sequestrated, initiating the signal cascade leading to an increase in its own synthesis.

In fact, astrocytes synthesize and release extracellular matrix proteins and adhesion molecules, which participate not only in the migration of neurons but also in the formation of neuronal aggregates. In addition, astrocytes produce a broad spectrum of growth factors and cytokines, which can regulate the morphology, proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neurons (for a review, see Ref. 1Laming P.R. Kimelberg H. Robinson S. Salm A. Hawrylak N. Muller C. Roots B. Ng K. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2000; 24: 295-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We (2Tabernero A. Lavado E. Granda B. Velasco A. Medina J.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 606-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have recently shown that astrocytes synthesize oleic acid from the main metabolic substrates, and oleic acid is released to the extracellular medium. Oleic acid is then incorporated in neurons, specifically into growth cones, and its presence promotes neuronal differentiation. Thus, the presence of oleic acid induces axonal growth, neuronal clustering, and expression of the axonal growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) by a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. All these observations indicate that oleic acid behaves as a neurotrophic factor. The signal that triggers oleic acid synthesis in astrocytes is the serum protein albumin (2Tabernero A. Lavado E. Granda B. Velasco A. Medina J.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 606-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It is well documented that albumin reaches high concentrations in the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid of newborn mammals, unlike the situation in adults (3Trojan J. Uriel J. C. R. Acad. Sci.

Zakut H. Soreq H. Dev. Biol. 1988; 128: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The presence of albumin in the brain may be due to the existence of a mechanism through which albumin is transferred from the blood to the brain and cerebrospinal fluid that is active only in the immature brain (6Habgood M.D. Sedgwick J.E.C. Dziegielewska K.M. Saunders N.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 456: 181-192Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Ohsugi M. Sato H. Yamamura H. Biol. Neonate. 1992; 62: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, the in situ synthesis of albumin can also contribute to the increased albumin levels found in the newborn brain (8Dziegielewska K.M. Evans C.A.N. New H. Reynolds M.L. Saunders N.R. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1984; 2: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is also well known that oleic acid synthesis is regulated by the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1),1 a basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factor that induces enzymes involved in oleic acid synthesis such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ATP citrate (pro-S)-lyase, fatty acid synthase, NADPH-producing enzymes, and stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase (SCD) (9Bennett M.K.

Like other members of the SREBP family, SREBP-1 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is activated by proteolysis, releasing an active mature form that binds to the promoters of genes containing sterol-responsive elements (SRE; for a review, see Ref. 13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). A critical committed step in the synthesis of oleic acid is the introduction of the cis-double bond in the Δ9 position, catalyzed by SCD, an enzyme also located in the ER that is transcriptionally activated by SREBP-1 because its gene contains the SRE (14Tabor D.E. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20603-20610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Oleic acid synthesis is feedback-regulated because oleic acid suppresses SREBP-1 activation (15Thewke D.P. Panini S.R. Sinensky M. J. Biol.

Commun. 2000; 273: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), both of which accompany the decrease in oleic acid synthesis (19Kim Y.-C. Gomez F.E. Fox B.G. Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1310-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the presence of albumin in the brain is developmentally regulated, it has been suggested that this protein could play an important role in neural cell differentiation (4Saunders N.R. Mollgard K. Trends Neurosci. 1981; 4: 56-60Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, albumin induces the synthesis and release of oleic acid by astrocytes, which behaves as a neurotrophic factor (2Tabernero A. Lavado E. Granda B. Velasco A. Medina J.M. J.

Therefore, in this work we investigated the mechanism by which albumin promotes oleic acid synthesis in astrocytes. Albino Wistar rats, fed ad libitum on a stock laboratory diet (49.8% carbohydrates, 23.5% protein, 3.7% fat, 5.5% (w/v) minerals, and added vitamins and amino acids), were used for the experiments. Rats were maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle. Postnatal day 1 newborn rats were used to prepare astrocytes. Astrocyte cultures were prepared and cultured in DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum as reported previously (20Tabernero A. Bolaños J.P. Medina J.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, animals were decapitated, and their brains were immediately excised. After removing the meninges and blood vessels, cells were dissociated from the forebrains. Cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine (10 μg/ml)-coated Petri dishes at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells/cm2. 14 DIV astrocytes were loaded at 37 °C in Elliot buffer (21Elliot K.A.C. Lajtha A. Handbook of Neurochemistry. 2. Plenum Press, New York1969: 103-114Crossref Google Scholar) (11 mm sodium phosphate, 122 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 1.3 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4) containing 5 mm glucose and 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-BSA; Sigma) as described (22Tabernero A. Medina A. Sánchez-Abarca L.I. Lavado E. Medina J.M. Glia. 1999; 25: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After 10 min, cells were washed three times at 4 °C with Elliot buffer and washed an additional three times with Elliot buffer plus 2% (w/v) BSA. For the unloading experiments, loaded astrocytes were kept in Elliot buffer plus 2% (w/v) BSA at 37 °C or 4 °C. At different times, the cells were visualized by confocal microscopy (excitation at 488 nm; Zeiss LSM 510), and the medium was recovered to measure fluorescence (λex at 495 nm; λem at 525 nm). To measure the FITC-BSA remaining inside the cells, fluorescence photomicrographs were captured with a digital video camera (Leica DC100), and the fluorescence was quantified using image analyzer software (NIH Image, kindly supplied by Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). For the experiments with the inhibitors, 14 DIV astrocytes were preincubated at 37 °C in DMEM containing 1 μm phenylarsine oxide (PAO), 30 μmmonensin, 50 μm nocodazole, 100 μmcolchicine, or 40 μm brefeldin A (BFA) for 20 min. For treatment with lectins or protamine, 14 DIV astrocytes were preincubated at 37 °C in PBS containing 0.01% protamine, 50 μg/ml Limax flavus agglutinin, 50 μg/ml Glycine max agglutinin, or 50 μg/ml G. max agglutinin plus 750 mmN-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) for 5 min. For treatment with proteases, 14 DIV astrocytes were preincubated at 37 °C in PBS containing 2 mm EDTA and 0.25% trypsin or 0.1% Pronase from Streptomyces griseus type XIV (Sigma) for 5 min. Controls were carried out by preincubating cells in PBS with 2 mm EDTA. Because protease digestion disrupts the cell monolayer, astrocytes were collected, washed, and allowed to attach to the Petri dish for 1 h before loading with FITC-BSA. Apart from protamine, trypsin, or Pronase, the inhibitors were maintained at the same concentration for the rest of the experiments. Cell incubations were carried out as described previously (20Tabernero A. Bolaños J.P. Medina J.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 14 DIV astrocytes grown on Petri dishes (25 cm2) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 1.5 ml of Elliot buffer containing cold and radiolabeled substrates in the absence or presence of BSA as indicated. For the experiments with the inhibitors, 14 DIV astrocytes were preincubated at 37 °C with 1 μm PAO, 30 μm monensin, 50 μm nocodazole, or 40 μm BFA in DMEM for 20 min. The inhibitors were maintained for the rest of the time of the experiments. After the incubation, the medium was recovered for analysis. Oleic acid synthesized and released to the extracellular medium was determined as described previously (2Tabernero A. Lavado E. Granda B. Velasco A. Medina J.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 606-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from the medium recovered after the incubation with a mixture of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) as described by Folch et al. (23Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oleic acid was analyzed as 4-bromophenacyl ester derivatives by a gradient-elution HPLC method as described (24Elliott J.M. Haam B. Parkin K.L. J. Dairy Sci. 1989; 72: 2478-2482Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 0.5-ml fractions of the eluate were collected, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The medium recovered after the incubation was subjected to native horizontal electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gel, pH 8.9, following the manufacturer's instructions (Clean Gel, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). When the migration had finished, the gel was cut into three portions. One portion was incubated with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Blue. A second gel portion was incubated with 3% (w/v) cupric acetate in 8% (v/v) orthophosphoric acid and dried at 110 °C. The third gel portion was exposed for 30 days to an autoradiographic film at −70 °C. Astrocytes were incubated at 37 °C in Elliot buffer containing 5 mm glucose, 10 μCi/ml [1(2)-14C]acetate, and 2% (w/v) FITC-BSA. After 1 h, the incubation medium was removed, and the cells were thoroughly washed with PBS, PBS + 2% BSA, and PBS at 4 °C. Astrocytes were then incubated at 37 °C in Elliot buffer containing 5 mmglucose. After 1 h, the medium was removed and subjected to native electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gel, pH 8.9. After the electrophoresis, the gels were first examined with an ultraviolet transilluminator to visualize the FITC-BSA released and were then autoradiographed to visualize radioactivity. HPLC analyses of the medium were carried out in parallel to identify the oleic acid synthesized and released. A construction designated pGFSREBP was made by ligating a PCR-generated fragment encoding amino acids 92–410 of the SREBP-1 into the HindIII-EcoRI sites of the pEGF-C1 vector (CLONTECH), which encodes the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The fragment encoding amino acids 92–410 was obtained by PCR using pCMV-SREBP-1a (ATCC) as a template, 5′ primer containing HindIII site (5′-cccaagcttgggcagcgccctcacccctg-3′), and 3′ primer containingEcoRI site (5′-ggaattccctatgtgttccctccactgcca-3′). This construct results in the expression of the truncated SREBP-1 protein (92) as a fusion to the C terminus of the GFP. Thus, the level of expression and the location of the truncated form of SREBP-1 can readily be followed by fluorescence microscopy. Astrocytes were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 0.9 μg of DNA (pEGF-C1 or pGFSREBP)/ml of DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum. After the addition of the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitate, 100 μm chloroquine was added for 5 h. Then, cells were washed, and 15% glycerol in HEPES-buffered saline was added for 30 s. After washing, cells were incubated in DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum for at least 24 h. Proteins (90 μg) were extracted from the cells and applied to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions and transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet (Bio-Rad) as described (25Tabernero A. Jimenez C. Velasco A. Giaume C. Medina J.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose sheet was then exposed for 12 h to monoclonal SREBP-1 antibody (1:500, PharMingen). Anti-mouse Ig biotin (1:1000, Sigma) was applied for 4 h followed by avidin-peroxidase conjugate (1:2000, Sigma) for 1 h. The AEC substrate staining kit (Sigma), prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions, was applied for 10 min. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by RNA precipitation with isopropyl alcohol and purification with 75% ethanol according the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA (20 μg) was then run on an agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Pall). The membrane was hybridized in the ExpressHyb hybridization buffer (CLONTECH) with32P[dCTP]-labeled cDNA at 65 °C for 1 h. The cDNA-encoding SCD (donated by Dr. J. M. Ntambi (26Ntambi J.M. Buhrow S.A. Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Sibley E. Kelly T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17291-17300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) in pC3 vector was obtained by digestion with PstI. The SCD cDNA was then labeled with 32P[dCTP] using the Random priming kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unincorporated deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were removed by chromatography through a Sepharose column. The nylon membrane was rinsed and then washed twice for 20 min in 2× SSC with 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate at room temperature followed by two 20-min washes in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50 °C before exposing to Biomax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The cDNA-encoding SCD, obtained as described above, was labeled with biotin-14-dCTP using the BioPrime DNA labeling kit (Invitrogen) and was used to detect SCD mRNA in astrocytes, as described (27Morgan L. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Development. 1994; 120: 1399-1409PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were hybridized with 0.3 μg/ml biotin cDNA at 65 °C for 18 h and washed several times in decreasing concentrations of standard saline citrate buffer. Biotin-labeled SCD cDNA probe was detected with the ExtrAvidin-Cy3 conjugate (Sigma). Results are means ± S.E.n represents the number of individual experiments carried out in duplicate or triplicate. Statistical analyses were carried out using ANOVA followed by the Scheffe F-test. We (22Tabernero A. Medina A. Sánchez-Abarca L.I. Lavado E. Medina J.M. Glia. 1999; 25: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have previously shown that astrocytes internalize BSA by a temperature-dependent process. To gain insight into the mechanism by which albumin is taken up by astrocytes, cells were exposed to FITC-BSA in the absence or in the presence of PAO, an inhibitor of receptor-mediated endocytosis (28Hertel C. Coulter S.J. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12547-12553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 10 min of loading, intracellular fluorescence was visualized by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1, A andC) and quantified from digitized fluorescence photomicrographs (Fig. 1E). As can be seen in Fig.1A, astrocytes were conspicuously loaded with FITC-BSA in discrete vesicle-like structures. Under these circumstances, PAO inhibited albumin internalization because only a few fluorescence spots were observed in the phase-contrast fluorescence superimposed photomicrographs (Fig. 1C). In fact, PAO inhibited FITC-BSA uptake by about 75% (Fig. 1E). To confirm the participation of an albumin-binding protein in albumin endocytosis, cells were treated with trypsin or Pronase, proteases that inhibit endocytosis by receptor proteolysis, or with L. flavus agglutinin orG. max agglutinin, lectins that block glycoprotein-mediated endocytosis by binding to glycosyl residues (29Schnitzer J.E. Carley W.W. Palade G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6773-6777Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It should be mentioned that L. flavus agglutinin binds toN-acetylneuraminyl or N-glycolylneuraminyl residues, whereas G. max agglutinin binds toN-acetylgalactosaminyl or galactosaminyl residues. Our results showed that after 5 min of treatment with trypsin or Pronase, astrocytes lost their ability to take up albumin (Fig. 1E). In addition, G. max agglutinin (but not L. flavusagglutinin) inhibited albumin internalization by about 70%. Furthermore, the presence of the specific hapten of G. maxagglutinin, GalNAc, prevented the G. max agglutinin effect. Finally, protamine, a basic protein that inhibits absorptive-mediated endocytosis (30Kumagai A.K. Eisenberg J.B. Pardridge W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15214-15219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also tested, but its presence did not modify albumin uptake (Fig. 1E). When FITC-BSA-loaded astrocytes were allowed to unload, very little fluorescence remained inside the cell after 1 h (Fig.1B). In order to know the kinetics of BSA release, loaded astrocytes were exposed to 2% (w/v) BSA and medium, and cell fluorescence was followed over 90 min at 37 °C (Fig. 1G). The decrease in cell fluorescence was seen to be concurrent with an increase in the fluorescence of the medium, suggesting that FITC-BSA was gradually released from astrocytes. The fluorescence of the medium and of the cells showed a linear and inverse correlation (R2 = 0.866; p < 0.001). FITC-BSA release was abolished at 4 °C (Fig. 1G), suggesting that the observed FITC-BSA release was an active process (see also Ref. 31Juurlink B.H.J. Devon R.M. Brain Res. 1990; 533: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results revealed that inhibitors of transcytosis, such as BFA (Fig. 1D), monensin, nocodazole, or colchicine (32Deffebach M.E. Bryan C.J. Hoy C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L744-L752PubMed Google Scholar), inhibited FITC-BSA release. Unloading was reduced to about 80% by the presence of monensin and to about 50–60% by the presence of BFA, nocodazole, or colchicine, as judged by the amount of fluorescence remaining inside the cells and the fluorescence recovered from the incubation medium (Fig. 1F). It should be noted that albumin uptake was not modified by the presence of brefeldin A, monensin, nocodazole, or colchicine (data not shown). Our results show that inhibitors of albumin endocytosis, such as PAO, inhibit oleic acid synthesis and release by astrocytes by about 90% (Fig.2A). Likewise, oleic acid synthesis and release was also inhibited by several inhibitors of transcytosis, such as monensin (94%), nocodazole (46%), or BFA (43%) (Fig. 2A). In addition, our observations suggest that oleic acid leaves astrocytes as a fatty acid-albumin complex. Thus, polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of the medium after incubation of astrocytes for 1 h with 10 mm lactate + 100–150 dpm/nmol [14C]lactate in the presence of 2% (w/v) BSA revealed that the putative fatty acid-BSA complex had the same RF, regardless of whether the gel was developed for proteins, fatty acids, or radioactivity (Fig.2B). These results clearly indicate that the radiolabeled oleic acid was bound to albumin in the medium recovered after the incubation. However, the possibility that the oleic acid-albumin complex could be formed in the extracellular medium after the release of free oleic acid from the cells cannot be excluded because albumin was always present in the extracellular medium throughout the experiment. To confirm that the oleic acid-BSA complex is indeed formed inside the cell and then released to the extracellular medium, astrocytes were loaded with FITC-BSA in the presence of radiolabeled substrates. After washing, FITC-BSA was allowed to unload from astrocytes, and the presence of oleic acid complexed to FITC-BSA was analyzed. Our results revealed that in electrophoresis, the FITC-BSA released from astrocytes migrates together with radiolabeled oleic acid (Fig. 2C). In addition, monensin, which inhibits albumin exocytosis, dramatically reduced the amount of FITC-BSA and radiolabeled oleic acid released from astrocytes to the extracellular medium (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the complex is formed inside the cell before being released to the extracellular medium. To gain insight into the mechanism by which albumin enhances oleic acid synthesis, we investigated the possible changes in mature/precursor forms of SREBP-1, a transcription factor that stimulates oleic acid synthesis (11Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 12Pai J.T. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Oleic acid protects SREBP-1 proteolysis by preventing the cleavage and release of low molecular mass SREBP-1 mature form (15Thewke D.P. Panini S.R. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21402-21407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Worgall T.S. Sturley S.L. Seo T. Osborne T.F. Dekelbaum R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 4365-4372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), which induces the enzymes involved in oleic acid synthesis (11Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 12Pai J.T. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 18Thewke D. Kramer M. Sinensky M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this context, our results show that albumin increases the amount of the low molecular mass SREBP-1 mature form, whereas it decreases that of the high molecular mass SREBP-1 inactive precursor (Fig.3A). The effect of albumin on SREBP-1 proteolysis was avoided by the presence of 100 μmoleic acid or 50 μm nocodazole (the latter inhibits the transport of proteins to the ER (33Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H.P. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 3A). To investigate whether the effect of albumin on SREBP-1 might be associated with changes in the mRNA synthesis of SCD, an enzyme located in the ER that catalyzes the formation of the Δ9-cis-double bond of oleic acid, Northern blot analysis was performed with RNA extracts from astrocytes under the same experimental conditions as those used to investigate SREBP-1 proteolytic changes. Albumin increased SCD mRNA, whereas the presence of 100 μm oleic acid or 50 μmnocodazole clearly counteracted its effect (Fig. 3B). To confirm whether SREBP-1a is directly involved in the stimulation of oleic acid synthesis caused by albumin, we used a truncated form of the SREBP protein that binds to the SRE-1 site of theSCD gene, preventing the stimulation of SCD transcription caused by SREBP-1a. The truncated form of SREBP-1a containing amino acids 92–410 has been reported to be an efficient inhibitor of the transcriptional activity of SREBP-1a. In fact, this truncated protein retains the ability to translocate to the nucleus and bind to SRE-1, preventing the binding of SREBP-1a (34Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M. Ho Y. Goldstein J. Brown M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we designed experiments to overexpress this truncated form of SREBP-1a in astrocytes and to test the effect of albumin under these circumstances. A construction designated pGFSREBP was made that results in the expression of the truncated SREBP-1 protein (92) as a fusion to the C terminus of the GFP. Astrocytes were then transfected with pEGFP or with pGFSREBP. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with albumin for 8 h, and the level of expression of the SCD mRNA was analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (Fig. 3,C–F). Astrocytes transfected with pGFSREBP (Fig. 3,C and E) showed a clear translocation of the truncated protein to the nucleus (Fig. 3C,arrows). In addition, SCD mRNA was not increased in pGFSREBP-transfected astrocytes (Fig. 3E; note the absence of SCD mRNA in the transfected astrocyte, indicated byarrows), whereas it was strongly enhanced in non-transfected astrocytes (other cells in Fig. 3E) by the presence of albumin. The overexpression of GFP (Fig. 3D) did not modify the effect of albumin on SCD mRNA expression (Fig.3F). We (2Tabernero A. Lavado E. Granda B. Velasco A. Medina J.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 606-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have recently shown that astrocytes synthesize and release oleic acid, which induces neuronal differentiation. The signal that triggers oleic acid synthesis and release by astrocytes is albumin (2Tabernero A. Lavado E. Granda B. Velasco A. Medina J.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 606-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), a serum protein that is specifically taken up by the brain during development (3Trojan J. Uriel J. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1979; 289: 1157-1160Google Scholar, 4Saunders N.R. Mollgard K. Trends Neurosci. 1981; 4: 56-60Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6Habgood M.D. Sedgwick J.E.C. Dziegielewska K.M. Saunders N.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 456: 181-192Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Ohsugi M. Sato H. Yamamura H. Biol. Neonate. 1992; 62: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that astrocytes take up albumin by receptor-mediated endocytosis and that this is followed by translocation (see also Ref. 31Juurlink B.H.J. Devon R.M. Brain Res. 1990; 533: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and exocytosis (Fig. 1). Thus, the existence of absorptive-mediated endocytosis can be precluded because albumin uptake was not affected by the presence of protamine (Fig. 1E), an inhibitor of this process (30Kumagai A.K. Eisenberg J.B. Pardridge W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15214-15219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, albumin internalization was inhibited by PAO (Fig.1E), an inhibitor of receptor-mediated endocytosis (28Hertel C. Coulter S.J. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12547-12553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with the idea that an albumin-binding protein located on the astrocytic plasma membrane would be involved in albumin uptake. In consonance with this, a brief treatment with proteases prevented albumin internalization in astrocytes (Fig. 1E), suggesting that albumin internalization is mediated by a protein that acts as a putative albumin receptor. This would probably be a glycoprotein containing N-acetylgalactosaminyl or galactosaminyl residues because albumin endocytosis was inhibited byG. max agglutinin (Fig. 1E), a lectin that binds to these glycoprotein residues (29Schnitzer J.E. Carley W.W. Palade G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6773-6777Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Our results also suggest that, once inside the astrocyte, albumin moves by vesicle-mediated transcytosis (Fig. 1A). In fact, FITC-BSA release was a temperature-dependent process (Fig. 1G) and was inhibited by microtubule-disrupting agents such as nocodazole or colchicine (Fig. 1F), suggesting that albumin is transported by microtubule-guided vesicles from the Golgi to the ER (33Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H.P. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Moreover, albumin release by astrocytes was inhibited by BFA and monensin (Fig.1, D and F), both of which prevent vesicular trafficking from the ER to the Golgi (35Ulmer J.B. Palade G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6992-6996Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) or from this to the plasma membrane (36Mollenhauer H.H. Morre D.J. Rowe L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 225-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), respectively. Our results show that the inhibition of endocytosis, transcytosis, or exocytosis by protein trafficking inhibitors is associated with a significant inhibition of oleic acid synthesis and/or release by astrocytes (Fig. 2A). Therefore, it may be concluded that the passage of albumin through the astrocyte promotes oleic acid synthesis. Moreover, both BFA and nocodazole inhibited the intracellular trafficking of FITC-BSA (Fig. 1), indicating that albumin would pass through the ER (33Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H.P. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Because albumin shows a high affinity for oleic acid (37Spector A.A. Fletcher J.E. Dietschy J.M. Gotto A.M. Ontko J.A. Disturbances in Lipid and Lipoprotein Metabolism. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, Maryland1978: 229-249Google Scholar) and because this fatty acid is synthesized in the ER, it is reasonable to suggest that albumin sequestrates oleic acid in the ER (Fig. 4) to be released as an oleic acid-albumin complex by active exocytosis (Fig. 2, Band C, and Fig. 4). Oleic acid synthesis must be feedback-regulated because oleic acid suppresses SREBP-1 activation (15Thewke D.P. Panini S.R. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21402-21407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Worgall T.S. Sturley S.L. Seo T. Osborne T.F. Dekelbaum R.J. J. Biol.

Commun. 2000; 273: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), both of which accompany the decrease in oleic acid synthesis (19Kim Y.-C. Gomez F.E. Fox B.G. Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1310-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SREBP-1 is the transcription factor that induces the enzymes involved in oleic acid synthesis, in particular SCD (11Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 12Pai J.T. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

SREBP-1 is also located in the ER and is activated by proteolysis, releasing an active mature form which binds to the promoters of genes containing SRE (for a review, see Ref. 13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). In this context, our results show that albumin promotes SREBP-1 cleavage, resulting in an increase in the SREBP-1 mature form (Fig. 3A). SREBP-1 proteolysis promoted by albumin was associated with the induction of SCD, as judged by the increase in SCD mRNA concentrations observed in the presence of albumin (Fig. 3B). In fact, the truncated form of SREBP-1, which retains the ability to translocate to the nucleus (Fig. 3C) and bind to SRE-1, preventing the binding of SREBP-1a (34Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M. Ho Y. Goldstein J. Brown M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibited the effect of albumin on SCD mRNA expression (Fig. 3E). Therefore, it may be concluded that SREBP-1 mediates the effect of albumin on oleic acid synthesis. Because oleic acid protects SREBP-1 from proteolysis (15Thewke D.P. Panini S.R. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21402-21407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Worgall T.S. Sturley S.L. Seo T. Osborne T.F. Dekelbaum R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 4365-4372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to suggest that the effect of albumin would be brought about by sequestration of the fatty acid in the ER. In agreement with this, when the sequestration of oleic acid was prevented by the addition of albumin already containing oleic acid, SREBP-1 cleavage and the increase in SCD mRNA were abolished (Fig. 3, A andB). Furthermore, when the passage of albumin through the ER was prevented by nocodazole, a drug that inhibits the transport of proteins to the ER (33Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H.P. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), the effect of albumin on SREBP-1 activation and SCD mRNA was also avoided (Fig. 3, A andB), indicating that albumin has to reach the ER to activate the signal cascade leading to oleic acid synthesis. Taken together, our results indicate that the transcytosis of albumin through the astrocyte involves its passage through the ER (Fig. 4). Once in the ER, albumin would sequestrate newly synthesized oleic acid, activating the transcription factor SREBP-1. The mature form of SREBP-1 would migrate to the nucleus, activating the transcription of SCD in order to increase oleic acid synthesis. The oleic acid-albumin complex would then be transported from the ER to the plasma membrane, where it would be released by active exocytosis to access neurons. It should be mentioned that the end feet of astrocytes completely surround blood capillaries, whereas the other processes of astrocytes contact with neurons (38Peters A. Palay S.L. de Webster H. The Fine Structure of the Nervous System: Neurons and Their Supportive Cells. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 273-311Google Scholar). Because the transfer of albumin from the blood to the brain across the blood-brain barrier is developmentally regulated (6Habgood M.D. Sedgwick J.E.C. Dziegielewska K.M. Saunders N.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 456: 181-192Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar), it is easy to speculate that during development, the end feet of astrocytes take up albumin, which is then translocated to the ER, inducing oleic acid synthesis. The oleic acid-albumin complex would then be released to the extracellular medium in contact with neurons to promote its differentiation (Fig. 4). We thank Prof. J. M. Ntambi for SCD plasmid.

https://openalex.org/W2047006826,"Dynamic alterations in chromatin structure mediated by postsynthetic histone modifications and DNA methylation constitute a major regulatory mechanism in DNA functioning. DNA methylation has been implicated in transcriptional silencing, in part by inducing chromatin condensation. To understand the methylation-dependent chromatin structure, we performed atomic force microscope (AFM) studies of fibers isolated from cultured cells containing normal or elevated levels of m5C. Chromatin fibers were reconstituted on control or methylated DNA templates in the presence or absence of linker histone. Visual inspection of AFM images, combined with quantitative analysis of fiber structural parameters, suggested that DNA methylation induced fiber compaction only in the presence of linker histones. This conclusion was further substantiated by biochemical results."

This was an important goal because studies employing hirudin peptides or F2 as probes of exosite involvement in other thrombin interactions could not be interpreted unambiguously, and it was uncertain whether the effects were due to competitive binding of alternate exosite I or II ligands or to extremely negative exosite linkage.

Binding of Fbg to exosite I and the monoclonal antibody to exosite II were similarly characterized and quantitated for the first time in this context. The results support the conclusion that binding of the exosite I and II ligands studied here conforms to a model with independent exosite interactions enabling formation of binary and ternary complexes with experimentally indistinguishable affinity. Structurally different exosite ligands produced different effects on the catalytic site, evidenced by different fluorescence changes of active site-labeled thrombins. Non-additive perturbations of the catalytic site accompany the exosite interactions, such that free thrombin and thrombin in binary and ternary complexes have unique properties. Analysis of experimental error in the dissociation constants for an array of ligands and a number of alternate experimental designs provided no evidence to substantiate extremely negative allosteric linkage between the exosites. It is concluded that the affinity of non-interacting, model exosite I and II ligands for thrombin remains unchanged whether the alternative exosite is occupied or not. Changes in binding affinity of factors V and Va, thrombomodulin, fibrin, and high molecular weight heparin affected by model exosite-specific ligands are likely to be due to competitive overlapping binding sites or additional interactions between the ligands themselves, but not to extreme inter-exosite allosteric linkage.

Fluorescent meizothrombin-des-F1 was prepared by incorporation of ATA-FPR-CH2Cl during activation of prethrombin 1 by ecarin and subsequent labeling with IAANS (40Bock P.E. J. Biol.

The concentration of nonsulfated Hir54–65 and Hir54–65(SO 3−) (Sigma or Bachem) in water or reaction buffer was determined from the purity and peptide content specified by the manufacturer. [5F]Hir54–65(SO 3−) was prepared by labeling Hir54–65(SO 3−) with 5-carboxy(fluorescein) as described previously (35Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were made with an SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer, using acrylic cuvettes coated with polyethylene glycol 20,000 except in tryptophan fluorescence experiments. Excitation and emission wavelengths are as follows: [5F]Hir54–65(SO 3−), 491 and 520 nm, 4–8 nm bandpass; [5F]-, [6F]-, and [4′F]FPR-thrombin, 495 and 520 nm, 4–8 or 8–16 nm bandpass; [ANS]FFR-thrombin and [ANS]FPR-thrombin, 325 and 450 nm, 8–16 nm bandpass; and [5F]- and [6F]FPR-thrombin tryptophan fluorescence, 295 nm excitation and 360 nm emission, 4–8 nm bandpass. Titrations were performed by successive addition of small titrant volumes with ≤13% dilution and corrected for dilution and background. Individual fluorescence measurements were recorded after 5 min of equilibration and were averaged over 10–20 readings. Multiple titrations using overlapping titrant concentrations were combined to eliminate error propagation typical for multiple (>6) additions. Results were expressed as the fractional changes in the initial fluorescence ((F obs −F o)/F o = ΔF/F o) as a function of total titrant concentration and were fit by the appropriate binding equation. Direct binding of F2 to [5F]FPR-thrombin, of competitive F2 binding to unlabeled thrombins, and thrombin inactivation by antithrombin was performed in two buffer systems as follows: 50 mm Hepes, 0.11 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol, pH 7.4; and the same buffer with 0.125m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. FPR-CH2Cl (1 μm) was added to all titrations except those containing native thrombin. Fluorescence titrations of direct binding of F2 to [5F]- and [6F]FPR-thrombin were analyzed by the quadratic equation for binding of a single ligand (40Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to obtain the maximum fluorescence intensity change (ΔF max /F o) and the dissociation constant (K D), with one binding site assumed on thrombin (n = 1). Binding of F2 to native thrombin, and the active site-blocked species ATA-FPR-thrombin and ATA-FFR-thrombin (0, 9, or 25 μm unlabeled thrombin), was measured in competitive binding experiments using [5F]FPR-thrombin (0.26 μm) as a probe. The dependence of ΔF/F o on the F2 concentration in the absence and presence of competing unlabeled thrombin were analyzed by least squares fitting of the cubic competitive binding equation defining the fractions [T*·F2]/(n[T*] o) and [T·F2]/(n[T] o) for competitive binding of F2 to labeled (T*) and unlabeled thrombin (T), as described previously (54Lindahl P. Raub-Segall E. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 55Olson S.T. Bock P.E. Sheffer R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The observed fluorescence change is given by the contribution of the T*·F2 complex, weighted by the maximum fluorescence change associated with its formation (Equation 1), ΔFFo=([T*⋅F2]n[T*]o)ΔFmaxFoEquation 1 in which [T*] o is the total concentration of T*, andn is the number of equivalent and independent binding sites for F2. With an assumed 1:1 stoichiometry for the thrombin·F2 complex, the fitted parameters were ΔF max /F o, and the dissociation constants were K T*(F2) andK T(F2). The properties of the thrombin derivatives [5F]FPR-T and [6F]FPR-T in reporting the interactions with F2 and Hir54–65(SO 3−) with unequal and opposite fluorescence changes were used for monitoring the joint interactions. In separate experiments, 50–100 nm[5F]FPR-thrombin or [6F]FPR-thrombin were titrated with F2, in the absence and presence of 20 μmHir54–65(SO 3−). In complementary experiments, the labeled thrombins were also titrated with Hir54–65(SO 3−) in the absence and presence of 32.5 μm F2. In all of the experiments, the observed fluorescence change was given by Equation 2for the ternary complex model (SchemeFSI). ΔFFo=([T*⋅H]n[T*]o)ΔFmax T*⋅HFo+([T*⋅F2]n[T*]o)ΔFmax T*⋅F2Fo+([T*Â·F2Â·H]n[T*]o)ΔFmax T*⋅F2⋅HFoEquation 2 [T*·H] is the T*·Hir54–65(SO 3−) complex; [T*·F2] is the T*·F2 complex, and [T*·F2·H] is the ternary complex, T*·F2·Hir54–65(SO 3−). The combined data sets for each labeled thrombin were fit by Equation2, with the concentrations of the binary and the ternary complexes calculated by simultaneous solution of the expressions for the equilibrium constants defined by the model, and the mass conservation equations. The fitted parameters were the individual ΔF max /F o values for the binary and ternary complexes, the dissociation constants for the binary complexes, K T*(F2) andK T*(H), and the dissociation constants,K T*·F2(H) andK T*·H(F2), for formation of the ternary complex. Because of the small fluorescence changes resulting from the interaction of Hir54–65(SO 3−) with [5F]FPR-thrombin and [6F]FPR-thrombin, binding was quantitated independently from the changes in tryptophan fluorescence of 100 nm labeled thrombin titrated with Hir54–65(SO 3−), andK T*(H) was fixed at the determined value. To determine the affinity of F2 for unlabeled thrombin species, 100 nm [5F]FPR-thrombin was titrated with F2 in the presence of 10 or 25 μm unlabeled thrombin. This was repeated in titrations with F2 at saturating Hir54–65(SO 3−) (50 μm). The competition binding data were fit by the cubic equation as described above (54Lindahl P. Raub-Segall E. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 55Olson S.T. Bock P.E. Sheffer R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to obtain ΔF max /F o values for the labeled binary and ternary complexes and the dissociation constants for F2 binding to labeled and unlabeled thrombin, respectively, in their free and Hir54–65(SO 3−)-saturated forms. [ANS]FFR-T and [4′F]FPR-T exhibited large fluorescence changes upon binding of Hir54–65(SO 3−), whereas F2 binding caused a significantly smaller effect which allowed the simultaneous interactions to be observed. [ANS]FFR-T (0.19 μm) was titrated with Hir54–65(SO 3−), in the absence and presence of 32.5 μm F2, and in separate experiments was titrated with F2, in the presence of fixed concentrations of Hir54–65(SO 3−). [4′F]FPR-T (10 nm) was titrated similarly with Hir54–65(SO 3−), in the absence and presence of 36 μm F2, and with F2 in the absence and presence of 20 μmHir54–65(SO 3−). The combined data sets for each labeled thrombin were fit by Equation 2 and the ternary complex model for binding of F2 and Hir54–65(SO 3−) to labeled thrombin (Scheme FSI).

Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5014) Google Scholar). However, in many cases, proper protein folding requires the assistance of molecular chaperones that bind to proteins in their nonnative states (2Bukau B. Horwich A.L.

Two major chaperone systems for the folding of cytosolic proteins in eukaryotes have been well studied. In one system, Hsc70/Hsp70 assists the folding of a large variety of proteins together with its co-chaperone, Hsp40. In the other system, the hetero-oligomeric chaperonin TCP1-ring complex (TRiC, also called CCT) together with its co-chaperone, prefoldin/GimC, assists the folding of a more limited set of proteins that includes actin and tubulin. In both chaperone systems, substrate proteins achieve their native states through cycles of ATP-dependent binding and release of chaperone proteins. It is well established that the nascent polypeptides of cytosolic proteins can fold co-translationally (8Frydman J. Hartl F.U. Science. 1996; 272: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 9Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U.

Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In contrast to monomeric proteins, little is known about the molecular mechanism of the folding and complex formation of proteins that have a subunit structure. CAD (caspase-activated DNase),1 also called DFF40 (DNA fragmentation factor 40), is a protein responsible for chromosomal DNA fragmentation during apoptosis (12Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar, 13Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

In proliferating cells, CAD exists as a complex with ICAD (inhibitor of CAD), also called DFF45 (DNA fragmentation factor 45), which suppresses its DNase activity (12Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar,13Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). When ICAD is cleaved by caspases (cysteine proteases that are activated during apoptosis), CAD is released from ICAD and degrades the chromosomal DNA (16Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). ICAD is not only an inhibitor, but is also essential for generating properly folded CAD; functional CAD is synthesized only in the presence of ICAD both in vitro andin vivo (17Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15740-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18Sakahira H. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). CAD and ICAD share a homologous domain (the CAD/CIDE domain) of about 80 amino acids at the N terminus (20Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar,21Mukae N. Enari M. Sakahira H. Fukuda Y. Inazawa J. Toh H. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9123-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These domains interact with each other to form the heterodimeric complex, and this interaction has been suggested to be essential for the correct folding of CAD (22Otomo T. Sakahira H. Uegaki K. Nagata S. Yamazaki T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether any other molecular chaperones in addition to ICAD are required for producing the functional CAD in CAD·ICAD complex and how these chaperones assist the folding of the CAD polypeptide during its synthesis. In this study, we found that in addition to ICAD, Hsc70 and Hsp40 are essential for the refolding of chemically denatured CAD. Hsc70 and Hsp40 could co-operatively suppress the aggregation of CAD in an ATP-dependent manner in the absence ICAD, but could not restore the CAD DNase activity. The results from time-order addition experiments suggested that the denatured CAD is partially refolded by Hsp70 and Hsp40, followed by the binding of ICAD to produce a functional CAD·ICAD complex. Furthermore, in vitrotranslation experiments using truncated CAD mRNAs indicated that ICAD co-translationally assisted the folding of CAD by binding to the CAD/CIDE domain of the nascent CAD polypeptide on ribosomes. Production of recombinant mouse CAD was performed as described previously (17Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol.

FLAG-tagged mouse ICAD-L fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST-ICAD-L) and hexahistidine-tagged human caspase 3 were prepared as described previously (16Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). The CAD/CIDE domain of CAD (CAD-CD: residues 3–87) or CAD/CIDE domain-deleted CAD (CAD-ΔCD: residues 87–344) was tagged with an HA (influenza hemagglutinin protein) epitope and hexahistidines (EFAGYPYDVPDYAGRSHHHHHH) at the C terminus, expressed inEscherichia coli with a pET expression vector, and purified with an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. Hexahistidine-tagged human Hsp40 (HDJ1) was expressed in E. coli SG13009 and purified to homogeneity as described previously (23Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol.

Rabbit anti-CAD antibody recognizing a C-terminal peptide of mouse CAD was described previously (17Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol.

Anti-FLAG antibody (clone M2) and anti-HA antibody (clone 16B12 or rabbit polyclonal antibody) were purchased from Sigma and Babco, respectively. Anti-Hsc70/Hsp70 antibody (clone N27F3-4 or BB70), anti-TCP1/CCTα antibody (clone 23c), and rabbit anti-Hsp40/HDJ1 antibody were purchased from Stressgen. For immunodepletion, 200 μg of anti-Hsc70/Hsp70 antibody (clone N27F3-4) or anti-TCP1/CCTα antibody (clone 23c) was covalently cross-linked to 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) using dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce). Rabbit reticulocyte lysates were purchased from Promega. For use in the refolding assay, the reticulocyte lysates were spun for 60 min at 500,000 ×g, and the supernatants were passed through PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mmdithiothreitol). The DNase activity of CAD was determined as described previously (17Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15740-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In brief, DNA (1.0 μg) was incubated with the CAD·ICAD complex at 30 °C for 2 h in 20 μl of buffer B (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2), 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 1 mmp-amidinophenyl methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 2.4 pmol of human caspase 3. After incubation, the DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. CAD was precipitated with acetone and denatured by incubation at a concentration of 12.5 μm for 1 h at 25 °C in buffer A containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, as described previously (18Sakahira H. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8091-8096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The denatured CAD was diluted 100-fold with buffer A containing Hsc70, Hsp40, GST-ICAD-L, and ATP and incubated at 25 °C for 2 h. To monitor CAD aggregation, CAD was denatured at a concentration of 50 μm, then diluted 100-fold with buffer A containing chaperones and ATP, ATPγS, or apyrase. Aggregation was followed at 25 °C by measuring the turbidity at 320 nm as described previously (23Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol.

To detect the binding of Hsc70 to the denatured proteins, CAD, CAD-ΔCD, or CAD-CD was denatured at a concentration of 12.5 μm, as described above. The denatured protein was diluted 100-fold into buffer A containing Hsc70, Hsp40, and ATP and incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. One unit of apyrase (Sigma) was added to the mixture to stop the reaction, followed by incubation at 25 °C for 5 min. The samples were diluted with 500 μl of 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.2) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmEGTA, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 25% glycerol, 1 mm ADP, and 10 mg/ml BSA. Fifteen micrograms of anti-Hsc70/Hsp70 antibody (clone BB70) and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose were added to the mixture, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed thoroughly, and suspended in 50 μl of SDS-sample buffer. After heating at 95 °C for 5 min, the eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a membrane and analyzed by Western blotting. To pull-down the CAD·ICAD complex, denatured proteins were diluted 100-fold into 50 μl of buffer A containing Hsc70, Hsp40, GST-ICAD-L, and ATP and incubated at 25 °C for 2 h. The samples were diluted with 500 μl of buffer A supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, 25% glycerol, and 10 mg/ml BSA. After the addition of 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, and proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by Western blotting. Full-length mouse CAD and its deletion mutants were fused with an HA epitope at their C termini and ligated into pBluescript II (SK+). The plasmids were linearized after the C terminus of the HA tag and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase using RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production Systems (Promega). Thein vitro translation was performed using Flexi Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate Systems (Promega) at 30 °C for 25 min with 4 μg of mRNA in the presence of 6 pmol of GST-ICAD-L, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 40 units of RNasin (Promega) in a final volume of 50 μl. To isolate the ribosome-nascent chain complexes, 2 mmcycloheximide (Wako) and 20 units/ml apyrase were added to the lysates, followed by incubation at 25 °C for 5 min. The mixture was diluted 3-fold with buffer C (buffer A containing 0.5 mmcycloheximide, 0.3 unit/μl RNasin, and 1 mm ADP) and spun for 10 min at 15,000 × g to remove aggregates. The supernatant was spun for 20 min at 100,000 rpm (Beckman TLA120.2 rotor) at 4 °C through 800 μl of buffer C containing 500 mmsucrose. Ribosomal pellets were washed in buffer C, resuspended in 100 μl of SDS-sample buffer, and subjected to Western blotting. To analyze the ribosomes on a sucrose density gradient, the lysates were diluted 3-fold, layered onto a 12-ml linear 20–40% (w/v) sucrose gradient in buffer C, and spun at 4 °C for 4 h at 39,500 rpm using a Beckman SW40Ti rotor. One-milliliter fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube, and the absorbance at 254 nm was measured. Proteins in each fractions were precipitated by 5% trichloroacetic acid, washed with diethyl ether, and resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-urea-sample buffer for Western blotting analysis. We have previously shown that chemically denatured CAD can be renatured in the presence of ICAD and reticulocyte lysates (18Sakahira H. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8091-8096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Reticulocyte lysates are known to catalyze the refolding of a variety of proteins, by a process that requires ATP hydrolysis (25Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 26Schneider C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Nimmesgern E. Ouerfelli O. Danishefsky S. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14536-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). We first examined the requirement of ATP for the renaturation of CAD by reticulocyte lysates and ICAD. As shown in Fig.1A, CAD denatured by guanidine HCl was efficiently renatured in the presence of reticulocyte lysates, ICAD, and ATP. When apyrase or ATPγS was added to the reaction mixture instead of ATP, the denatured CAD was not renatured. This renaturation process required ICAD, but ICAD alone (without reticulocyte lysates) had little effect on the renaturation of CAD under these conditions. These results indicated that the reticulocyte lysates contained a factor(s) that enhances the correct folding of CAD in an ATP- and ICAD-dependent manner. Reticulocyte lysates carry the Hsc70 (the constitutively expressed Hsp70 homolog)-Hsp40 and TRiC-prefoldin chaperone systems, both of which require ATP hydrolysis to catalyze protein folding (25Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 26Schneider C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Nimmesgern E. Ouerfelli O. Danishefsky S. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14536-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To examine which of these systems is responsible for the renaturation of CAD, TRiC or Hsc70 was immunodepleted from the lysates. As shown in Fig. 1B, lysates in which TRiC was immunodepleted to less than 10% of its original level still promoted the renaturation of CAD as efficiently as the original lysates. On the other hand, Hsc70-depleted lysates could not promote the renaturation of CAD. These results suggested that Hsc70-Hsp40, but not TRiC-prefoldin, was involved in the refolding of CAD. To confirm this finding, we next tried to reconstitute the refolding of CAD using purified components. Recombinant human Hsp40 (HDJ1) and native bovine Hsc70 were purified to homogeneity (Fig.2A) and used for the refolding of CAD. As shown in Fig. 2B, Hsc70 or Hsp40 alone could not promote the renaturation of denatured CAD, even in the presence of ICAD. However, the addition of both Hsc70 and Hsp40 stimulated the renaturation of CAD in a dose-dependent manner. CAD was not renatured in the absence of ATP or in the presence of ATPγS, indicating that ATP hydrolysis is required (Fig. 2B). This process was time-dependent and was completed within 1 h (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that Hsc70/Hsp70 and Hsp40 together with ICAD could promote the refolding of CAD in an ATP-dependent manner. The Hsc70-Hsp40 system enhances the folding of proteins by suppressing aggregation of the denatured proteins (23Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To determine how CAD is refolded with Hsc70, Hsp40, and ICAD, we first examined whether CAD aggregation was suppressed by these chaperones. As shown in Fig. 3A, when chemically denatured CAD was diluted 100-fold, the protein was aggregated within 5 min. BSA or ICAD had no effect on the aggregation of CAD. In contrast, Hsc70 and Hsp40 suppressed the aggregation of CAD in the presence of ATP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). When added individually, Hsc70 or Hsp40 alone could not prevent CAD aggregation. Furthermore, ATPγS could not substitute for ATP, indicating that this process was accompanied by ATP hydrolysis. Hsc70-Hsp40 prevented CAD aggregation, but could not produce functional protein from denatured CAD. The addition of ICAD to Hsc70 and Hsp40 was required to complete the process, suggesting that ICAD recognized an intermediate folding state of CAD conferred by Hsc70-Hsp40. To confirm this possibility, time-order addition experiments were carried out using each chaperone. As shown in Fig. 4, when denatured CAD was diluted in a buffer containing Hsc70, Hsp40, and ICAD, functional CAD was regenerated. A similarly efficient refolding of CAD was observed when the denatured CAD was diluted into a buffer containing Hsc70 and Hsp40, and ICAD was added to the mixture 20 min after dilution. The addition of apyrase together with ICAD prevented the renaturation of CAD, which is consistent with the previous observations that the release of Hsc70/Hsp70 from substrate proteins is ATP-dependent (23Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). When the denatured CAD was first diluted into a buffer containing ICAD alone, the addition of Hsc70 and Hsp40 at 20 min after dilution had little effect on the renaturation of CAD. This result supported the idea that ICAD could not prevent the aggregation of denatured CAD and suggested that previously aggregated CAD could not be refolded with Hsc70-Hsp40. The above data suggested that CAD refolding occurs in an ordered manner: Hsc70 and Hsp40 partially refold the denatured CAD in the first step, and ICAD recognizes the quasi-native state of CAD to complete the folding of CAD in the second step. We have previously reported that an interaction between the CAD/CIDE domain of CAD (CAD-CD) and that of ICAD (ICAD-CD) is an essential step for the production of functional CAD (22Otomo T. Sakahira H. Uegaki K. Nagata S. Yamazaki T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the CAD/CIDE domain in the Hsc70-, Hsp40-, and ICAD-dependent folding of CAD, CAD-CD and CAD/CIDE domain-deleted CAD (CAD-ΔCD) were produced in E. coli and purified to homogeneity (Fig.5A). The wild-type CAD, CAD-CD, and CAD-ΔCD were denatured by treatment with 6 mguanidine HCl, diluted into a buffer containing Hsc70 and Hsp40, and incubated for 15 min. As shown in Fig. 5B, immunoprecipitation with the anti-Hsc70 antibody showed that CAD-ΔCD and wild-type CAD were associated with Hsc70, while CAD-CD was not. The interaction of CAD-ΔCD with Hsc70 was confirmed by the aggregation assay. That is, when the denatured CAD-ΔCD was diluted into a buffer, it quickly aggregated, and Hsc70/Hsp40 prevented this process (Fig.5C). In contrast, the denatured CAD-CD did not undergo aggregation upon dilution, suggesting that the CAD-CD domain refolds spontaneously. We then examined the interaction of the denatured CAD, CAD-ΔCD, and CAD-CD with ICAD during the refolding process (Fig. 5D). In this experiment, each of the denatured proteins was diluted into a solution containing Hsc70, Hsp40, and ICAD (GST-ICAD-L) and incubated for 2 h. When ICAD-L was pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose, CAD-CD and the wild-type CAD were found to be associated with ICAD. On the other hand, very little CAD-ΔCD was associated with ICAD. These results suggested that CAD-ΔCD, which might have been partially refolded by the Hsc70-Hsp40 system, could not be recognized by ICAD, and the CAD/CIDE domain worked as a scaffold to transfer CAD from Hsc70-Hsp40 to ICAD during its refolding. We next examined whether Hsc70-Hsp40 and ICAD were involved in the de novo protein folding that must be accomplished in the context of the vectorial synthesis of polypeptide chains on ribosomes (5Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar, 27Bukau B. Deuerling E. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 119-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). For this set of experiments, CAD mRNA lacking a stop codon was prepared and translated in reticulocyte lysates (9Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1994; 370: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 28Krieg U.C. Johnson A.E. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2033-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29McCallum C.D. Do H. Johnson A.E. Frydman J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6A, CAD was detected in the lysates when CAD mRNA was translated either in the presence or absence of ICAD. Upon centrifugation of the lysates through a sucrose cushion, at least 50% of the CAD polypeptides were recovered in the ribosomal fractions. When the CAD mRNA was translated in the absence of ICAD, both Hsc70 and Hsp40 were found to be associated with ribosomes, and when CAD mRNA was translated in the presence of ICAD, Hsc70, Hsp40, and ICAD were all found in the ribosomal fraction. In contrast, when firefly luciferase mRNA lacking a stop codon was translated in the reticulocyte lysates in the presence of ICAD, Hsc70 and Hsp40, but not ICAD, were found in the ribosomal fraction (data not shown). To confirm the binding of ICAD to ribosomes, the CAD-translating reticulocyte lysates were analyzed by centrifugation on a linear sucrose gradient. As shown in Fig. 6B, ribosomes, CAD, and ICAD co-sedimented. These results suggested that ICAD specifically bound to the nascent polypeptide of CAD on ribosomes. To examine which part of the CAD polypeptide is responsible for the binding of ICAD, mRNA coding for truncated HA-tagged CAD containing a series of deletions was prepared (Fig.7A) and translated in reticulocyte lysates in the presence of ICAD. As shown in Fig.7B, each mRNA produced a protein of the expected sizes. After centrifugation of the lysates through a sucrose cushion, most of the mutant CAD polypeptides were found in the ribosomal fraction, indicating that the nascent CAD polypetides were still on the ribosomes. ICAD was found in the ribosomal fraction when the mRNAs for the CAD mutants M1, M2, and M3 (defined in the legend for Fig.7A) as well as the wild-type CAD were translated. In contrast, ICAD was not detected in the ribosomal fraction when CAD-ΔCD was translated. These results indicated that the CAD/CIDE domain at the N terminus of CAD is necessary and sufficient to recruit ICAD to the nascent CAD polypeptide on ribosomes. Co-translational, domain-wise folding is proposed to be important for the proper formation of multidomain proteins (30Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 68-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although the tertiary structure of CAD has not yet been determined, it seems to be composed of two domains: the N-terminal CAD domain (CAD-CD) and the C-terminal DNase domain (31Sakahira H. Takemura Y. Nagata S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, the limited digestion of CAD with proteinase K produced two distinct fragments (data not shown), and the active Drosophila CAD is composed of two subunits (32Yokoyama H. Mukae N. Sakahira H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12978-12986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). CAD-CD seems to fold spontaneously, because the denatured CAD-CD does not undergo aggregation upon dilution, and it does not bind Hsc70. ICAD binds CAD-CD that has been spontaneously folded (22Otomo T. Sakahira H. Uegaki K. Nagata S. Yamazaki T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that the spontaneously folded CAD-CD had the proper tertiary structure to be recognized by ICAD. On the other hand, Hsc70 and Hsp40 interacted with CAD-ΔCD and prevented its aggregation. Furthermore, ICAD was capable of producing functional CAD from the Hsc70-Hsp40-treated denatured CAD. Because Hsc70, Hsp40, and ICAD were also found to be associated with the CAD nascent polypeptide on ribosomes, we concluded that CAD is co-translationally folded by Hsc70-Hsp40 and ICAD. It is possible that as the N-terminal part of CAD is synthesized and emerges from the ribosome, CAD-CD spontaneously folds. ICAD may bind to the CAD nascent polypeptide by recognizing the folded CAD-CD. As the translation proceeds, Hsc70 and Hsp40 bind to the elongating C-terminal part of CAD, assist its folding, and generate a “molten globule”-like status for CAD (33Ewbank J.J. Creighton T.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 34Kuwajima K. Proteins. 1989; 6: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). The ICAD associated with CAD-CD then recognizes the partially folded C-terminal part of CAD and produces the correctly folded CAD polypeptide. The CAD·ICAD complex thus releases from the ribosomes. Because neither Hsc70 nor Hsp40 is associated with the purified CAD·ICAD (DFF) complex (13Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar), it is likely that Hsc70 and Hsp40 dissociate from CAD when CAD is completely folded as a complex with ICAD. Netzer and Hartl (30Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 68-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) proposed that the co-translational folding of proteins is an important mechanism to reduce the possibility of intramolecular misfolding that may lead to aggregation. When CAD is expressed alone in mammalian cells, insect cells, or E. coli, it undergoes aggregation (18Sakahira H. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8091-8096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the co-expression of CAD with ICAD generates soluble, functional CAD as a complex with ICAD, indicating that the ICAD-assisted co-translational folding of CAD occurs in cells. Furthermore, no functional CAD is produced in ICAD-knockout mice (19Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), also supporting the essential role of ICAD for CAD synthesis. By immunohistochemical analysis with anti-ICAD antibody or by following the localization of an ICAD-GFP fusion protein, several groups have reported that ICAD is located mainly in nuclei (35Lechardeur D. Drzymala L. Sharma M. Zylka D. Kinach R. Pacia J. Hicks C. Usmani N. Rommens J.M. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 36Samejima K. Tone S. Kottke T.J. Enari M. Sakahira H. Cooke C.A. Durrieu F. Martins L.M. Nagata S. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, the essential role of ICAD for the co-translational folding of CAD indicates that some ICAD must be in the cytoplasm. How ICAD shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm remains to be studied. Misfolded, aggregated proteins are often cytotoxic and lead to cell death (37Kakizuka A. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 396-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, cells deficient in the ICAD gene grow and are healthy and contain no detectable CAD protein, 2H. Nagase and S. Nagata, unpublished observation. suggesting that misfolded CAD is rapidly removed from the cells. It will be interesting to study how this process is regulated. How hetero-oligomeric proteins are folded and formed into complexes is not well understood. Here we showed that ICAD co-translationally binds to CAD during its folding and is released from ribosomes as a heterocomplex with CAD. There are a few reports of the co-translational assembly of homophilic protein complexes (38Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Leone G. McLure K. Lee P.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2651-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 39Young J.C. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For example, the reovirus cell attachment protein ς1 is a trimeric protein carrying two domains and seems to assemble co-translationally. The N-terminal domain trimerizes in an ATP-independent manner, followed by the trimerization of the C-terminal domain. Because the trimerization (and/or folding) of the C-terminal domain requires ATP hydrolysis, Gilmore et al. (38Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Leone G. McLure K. Lee P.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2651-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) postulated the involvement of a chaperone system. Similarly, the N-terminal CAD-CD domain may fold spontaneously, with ICAD then binding to the preformed N-terminal CAD-CD domain. The folding of the C-terminal part of CAD then continues with the help of Hsc70-Hsp40 and ICAD. Such co-translational and domain-wise folding coupled with the formation of the protein complex is probably a general mechanism for oligomeric proteins and may be facilitated by ribosome stacking and elongation arrest, as suggested previously (39Young J.C. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Taken together, a basic mechanism for the proper folding of both monomeric and oligomeric multidomain proteins may involve the spontaneous or easy folding of the N-terminal domain, with the prefolded N-terminal domain then promoting the proper folding of the C-terminal domain. Our demonstration that ICAD and general chaperones function collaboratively to produce a functional protein complex will contribute to the understanding of the folding and complex formation of hetero-oligomeric proteins. We thank Dr. K. Otsuka for providing E. coli transformants harboring the human Hsp40 expression plasmid and S. Aoyama for secretarial assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1978316536,"TAP/NXF1 is a conserved mRNA export receptor serving as a link between messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) and the nuclear pore complex. The mechanism by which TAP recognizes its export substrate is unclear. We show here that TAP is added to spliced mRNP in human cells. We identified a distinct region of TAP that targets it to mRNP. Using yeast two-hybrid screens and in vitro binding studies, we found that this region coincides with a direct binding site for U2AF35, the small subunit of the splicing factor U2AF. This interaction is evolutionarily conserved across metazoa, indicating its significance. We further found in human cells that the exogenously expressed large U2AF subunit, U2AF65, accumulates in spliced mRNP, leading to the recruitment of U2AF35 and TAP. Similarly to TAP, U2AF65 stimulated directly the nuclear export and expression of an mRNA that is otherwise retained in the nucleus. Together with our finding that U2AF is continuously exported from the nucleus, these data suggest that U2AF participates in nuclear export, by facilitating TAP's addition to its mRNA substrates.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 410-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At all metabolic steps, mRNA is part of ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNP). The primary transcripts associate with a subset of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) (reviewed in Ref. 14Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6860-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). This protein complex is composed of the splicing-associated factors SRm160, DEK, and RNP S1, as well as REF and the RNA-binding protein Y14 (19Le Hir H. Izaurralde E. Maquat L.E. Moore M.J.

Hence, REF was proposed to provide a link to export, possibly by recruiting TAP (18Zhou Z. Luo M.-J. Straesser K. Katahira J. Hurt E. Reed R.

We report that TAP is targeted to the spliced complexes, through a region that directly binds to U2AF35, the small subunit of the splicing factor U2AF.

Nuclei were extracted with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 0.5% Triton X-100 (N fraction). The remaining material was sonicated in the same buffer by five 3-s bursts, using VibraCell ultrasonic processor and a microtip (Sonics and Materials, Inc.), set at 40% amplitude (NUP fraction). For 293 cell extraction, the above protocol was modified: hypotonic lysis was performed in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 (CYT), and the nuclear N and NUP fractions were prepared in the presence of 400 mm NaCl. Prior to use, all extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. All manipulations were carried out at 4 °C, and the buffers contained 0.1 unit/ml RNasin. Total RNA was isolated using the RNasol protocol (Tel-Test, Inc.), and reverse transcription-PCR was performed with a Titan kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The primer pair for unspliced human glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) transcript spanning nucleotides 3393–3425 and 3536–3568 of the gene (accession no.

The primer pair for the spliced GAPDH transcript spanning nucleotides 3377–3401 and 3988–4012 and amplified a 325-bp fragment. mRNP capturing was performed using oligo(dT)25 magnetic beads (Dynal). Extracts from 106 cells were adjusted to 5 ml in 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mm KCl, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100 (293 cells) or 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 0.5% Triton X-100 (HeLa cells), and incubated with 20 μl of beads for 30 min at room temperature. As controls, some extracts were treated with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A for 10 min at room temperature, prior to binding to the oligo(dT) beads, or the empty beads (M280, Dynal) were used. After four washes in the same buffer, the mRNPs were eluted with water at 37 °C, or by boiling in 1× Laemmli sample buffer. U2AF mammalian expression vectors contain the coding regions inserted into pCMV-GFPsg25 (34Stauber R.H. Horie K. Carney P. Hudson E.A. Tarasova N.I. Gaitanaris G.A. Pavlakis G.N.

The expression plasmids for REF proteins and the p15 expression plasmid pEGFPN3zz-p15 were provided by E. Izaurralde. All recombinant DNAs were sequenced on both strands. RNA was separated on denaturing 1% agarose MOPS/formaldehyde or 10% polyacrylamide TBE/urea gels and analyzed on Northern blots (25Zolotukhin A.S. Valentin A. Pavlakis G.N. Felber B.K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7944-7952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using uniformly labeled cDNA probes spanning β-actin, GAPDH, histone H4 and luciferase coding regions, and the CAT probe (26Hope T.J. Huang X.J. McDonald D. Parslow T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7787-7791Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The U snRNAs were detected using 5′-labeled oligonucleotide probes. We studied the association of TAP with mRNP in HeLa cell extracts. The cytoplasmic fraction (CYT) was obtained by digitonin extraction in low salt buffer, and the soluble nuclear fraction (N) was extracted with 100 mm NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100. Because the bulk of hnRNPs associate with the insoluble nuclear components, the remaining nuclei were solubilized by sonication yielding the NUP extract, according to Ref. 29Pinol-Roma S. Choi Y.D. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar. The distribution of spliced and unspliced transcripts in these extracts was examined by reverse transcription-PCR for GAPDH transcripts. Fig. 1A shows that the CYT and N fractions were enriched in spliced mRNA, whereas NUP was enriched in pre-mRNA, as expected (29Pinol-Roma S. Choi Y.D. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The NUP fraction also contained small amounts of spliced GAPDH transcripts that were detectable upon prolonged amplification (data not shown). We further analyzed the β-actin transcripts in human 293 cells by Northern blots, and found a comparable distribution of spliced and unspliced mRNAs in the subcellular fractions (see also Fig. 7C). Together, these data indicate that the observed distribution patterns are not likely the artifacts of a particular cell line or detection method.Figure 7U2AF65 directly stimulates the nuclear export of CAT mRNA in human 293 cells. A, 293 cells were transfected with 1 μg of pDM138 and 1 μg of pRSVluc in the absence or in the presence of 25 ng of pHA-U2AF65, as indicated ontop. After 48 h, the HA-U2AF65 complexes were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of HA antibodies (BAbCO) from the soluble N and CYT extracts, as indicated at the bottom. The poly(A) RNA was extracted from the precipitates (bound) and from 1:10 aliquots of the supernatants (unbound), separated on 1% denaturing agarose gel, and analyzed on Northern blots for CAT and LUC transcripts. The positions of the unspliced (U) and the spliced (S) CAT mRNAs are shown to the left. The nonpolyadenylated RNA from the same samples was separated on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and analyzed on Northern blots for U snRNP. The positions of the individual snRNPs are shown to theleft. B, transfections were performed with 1 μg of pDM138 in the absence or in the presence of 25 ng of pHA-U2AF65, 0.1 μg of EGFPN3zz-p15, and 0.5 μg of pCMV-TAP as indicated. The unspliced CAT transcripts (U) were detected on Northern blots, as in panel A. C, Northern blot analysis of the unspliced (U) and the spliced (S) β-actin transcripts in the unbound fraction from the transfection shown in panel A. In addition to the CYT and N fractions, the insoluble NUP fraction was examined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) From the HeLa fractions, poly(A)-containing mRNPs were captured to oligo(dT) beads and analyzed on immunoblots. Fig. 1B shows that TAP associated with mRNPs only in the CYT and N fractions. Using anti-hnRNP A1 antibodies, we confirmed that hnRNPs were enriched in NUP (29Pinol-Roma S. Choi Y.D. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), in agreement with the notion that the general hnRNPs contain mostly pre-mRNA (23Kataoka N. Yong J. Kim N. Velazques F. Perkinson R.A. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We next showed that non-hnRNP proteins such as Ran GTPase and transportin were excluded from the mRNPs, as expected (32Siomi M.C. Eder P.S. Kataoka N. Wan L. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1181-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 36Clouse K.N. Luo M. Zhou Z. Reed R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), confirming the specificity of the assay (Fig. 1B). Because capturing of TAP was sensitive to RNase pretreatment, and the bound complexes coeluted with poly(A) RNA (Fig. 1B), TAP is a bona fide mRNP component. This association was resistant to 400 mm NaCl (see also Fig.2) and 0.5 mg/ml heparin (data not shown) similarly to that of tightly bound hnRNP proteins (29Pinol-Roma S. Choi Y.D. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In contrast, hGLE-2, the human orthologue of Rae1p (37Bharathi A. Ghosh A. Whalen W.A. Yoon J.H. Pu R. Dasso M. Dhar R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 251-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kraemer D. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9119-9124Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), was not detected in mRNPs (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the stable TAP-mRNP association is specific and is not a generic property of mRNA export factors. We hypothesized that the binding of TAP after splicing is facilitated by protein factors. To obtain a probe for such factors, we mapped the mRNP association region of TAP. TAP and its deletion mutants were transiently expressed in human cells as GFP fusion proteins (Fig.2A, load), and tested for mRNP association in soluble nuclear extracts (Fig. 2A, mRNP). As shown in Fig. 2A (left panel), like the endogenous TAP, the transiently expressed TAP-GFP (aa 61–619) associated with oligo(dT)-selected fraction in a poly(A) RNA-dependent manner. No selection occurred from RNase pretreated extracts or when using empty beads (left panel). Similar results were obtained using TAP tagged with hemagglutinin epitope peptide (HA) (see also Fig. 5), whereas no association was detected for the GFP moiety alone (data not shown). To exclude that this association was an in vitro artifact, we added recombinant GST-TAP61–372 to the extract prior to oligo(dT) capturing (Fig. 2A, right panel). Although this protein contains the complete RNA-binding domain of TAP, it did not access the mRNPs that were assembled in vivo and did not bind oligo(dT) on its own. To identify the minimal binding region, N- and C-terminal deletions of TAP (see Fig. 2,panel A and summary in panel B) were tested. TAP61–140 was the smallest region that associated efficiently, whereas further truncation to aa 61–120 reduced this association. We concluded that TAP is targeted to mRNP via a region spanning aa 61–140. To search for proteins that interact with the mRNP assembly region, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a HeLa complementary DNA (cDNA) library using TAP62–140 fused to the DNA-binding domain of LexA as bait. Using interaction-mating screens, we found that 2 of 24 primary clones also interacted with the complete human TAP, its human homologue TAPX2/NXF2 (10Herold A. Suyama M. Rodrigues J.P. Braun I.C.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 5Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Bear J. Patenaude D.J. Felber B.K. RNA. 2000; 6: 1762-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). No interactions occurred with the C-terminal TAP412–628, the human immunodeficiency virus-1 Rev nuclear export signal, or the empty plasmid, further indicating specificity of the observed interactions. Sequence analysis showed that these cDNAs encode a truncated U2AF35 protein (aa 69–240), the small subunit of the heterodimeric splicing factor U2AF. Using liquid culture assays (TableI), we found that the C. elegans orthologue Ce-U2AF35 (35Zorio D.A. Blumenthal T. RNA. 1999; 5: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) also interacted with the complete human TAP, TAP62–140, TAPX2, and Ce-NXF-1. The interacting regions of TAP and TAPX2 are 57% similar, whereas that of Ce-NXF-1 does not share detectable homology. Hence, this interaction is conserved between divergent proteins across metazoan species.Table IConserved interaction between metazoan TAP and U2AF35TAP (1–619)TAP (62–140)TAPX21-aThe TAPX2 region that matches aa 61–140 of TAP was assembled from two published sequences: aa 87–148 of TAPX2 (24), followed by aa 41–57 of the partial TAPX2 coding region (GenBank™ accession no.

ND, not done. Both U2AF35 and U2AF65, the large subunit of U2AF, contain a serine-arginine rich domain (RS) characteristic of a family of SR-related proteins. To exclude that the TAP proteins interacted with generic RS domains, we show that Ce-U2AF35, which naturally lacks RS, interacted efficiently with all TAP proteins tested (Table I). In addition, the RS deletion in hU2AF35 (aa 69–178) impaired but did not abolish the interaction (Table I), whereas the isolated RS domain of hU2AF35 (data not shown) or the hU2AF65 (Table I) did not interact. Thus, the RS domain did not represent the primary TAP interaction site, and the interaction is specific for U2AF35. We tested the interaction between purified recombinant TAP and U2AF35 proteins in vitro (Fig.3A). TAP proteins were produced in E. coli as GST fusion proteins, and the U2AF35 protein was expressed in baculovirus. The same amounts of purified GST-TAP proteins and the GST-U2AF65 were immobilized on glutathione beads and pull-down assays were performed in 300 mm salt and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to ensure that only strong interactions are detected. Fig. 3A shows that the GST moiety alone did not bind U2AF35, whereas GST-U2AF65 bound efficiently, confirming the specificity of the assay. We found that serial deletion mutants of GST-TAP61–372 including GST-TAP61–141 bound to U2AF35 efficiently, whereas the C-terminal truncation to aa 121 severely impaired the binding, and GST-TAP540–619 and 195–372 bound poorly. Comparison of the input and the bound samples (Fig. 3A) confirmed that a significant fraction of U2AF35 was bound. These data show that TAP has a direct binding site for U2AF35, which is located between aa 61 and 141, and coincides with the mRNP association region (aa 61–140, Fig. 2). We next examined the ability of TAP61–141 to bind RNA. As shown previously, TAP61–187 binds RNA directly under low stringency conditions (39Katahira J. Strasser K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the general RNA binding of a series of TAP peptides to a Bluescript-transcribed RNA (4Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. Luhrmann R. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) using gel shift assays. As shown in Fig. 3B, a core RNA binding site was found between aa 61 and 121. Similar results were obtained using different RNA probes (data not shown). To study whether RNA and U2AF35 can bind to TAP simultaneously, we performed the pull-down assays in the presence of SRV-1 CTE RNA (3Gruter P. Tabernero C. von Kobbe C. Schmitt C. Saavedra C. Bachi A. Wilm M. Felber B.K. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) or human histone H4 mRNA (2Braun I.C. Rohrbach E. Schmitt C. Izaurralde E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1953-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We used GST-TAP61–198 to ensure that the core RNA binding site was present in the context of the complete RNA binding domain (aa 119–198; Ref. 11Liker E. Fernandez E. Izaurralde E. Conti E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Both RNAs bound to GST-TAP61–198 efficiently, but did not compete for TAP-U2AF35 binding even at the highest concentration tested (4 μm, Fig.3C). As negative control, we used GST-TAP61–102, which showed only weak binding to both RNA and U2AF35, as expected (see Fig.3, A and B). Hence, the mRNP association region of TAP comprises independent direct binding sites for U2AF35 and RNA. U2AF is known to act early in splicing and does not associate with the ligated exons in vitro (for recent reviews, see Refs. 40Moore M.J. Nat. Struct.

We investigated the involvement of apoptotic events in INS-1 insulinoma cells overexpressing wild-type HNF-1α (WT-HNF-1α) or a dominant-negative mutant (DN-HNF-1α) under control of a doxycycline-dependent transcriptional activator. Forty-eight h after induction of DN-HNF-1α, INS-1 cells activated caspase-3 and underwent apoptotic cell death, while cells overexpressing WT-HNF-1α remained viable. Mitochondrial cytochromec release and activation of caspase-9 accompanied DN-HNF-1α-induced apoptosis, suggesting the involvement of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Activation of caspases was preceded by mitochondrial hyperpolarization and decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Transient overexpression of Bcl-xL was sufficient to rescue INS-1 cells from DN-HNF-1α-induced apoptosis. Both WT- and DN-HNF-1α-expressing cells demonstrated similar increases in apoptosis when cultured at high glucose (25 mm). In contrast, induction of DN-HNF-1α highly sensitized cells to ceramide toxicity. In cells cultured at low glucose, DN-HNF-1α induction also caused up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27KIP1. Therefore, our data indicate that increased sensitivity to the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and decreased cell proliferation may account for the progressive loss of β-cell function seen in MODY 3 subjects.

It results from heterozygous mutations of at least six different genes, one encoding for the glycolytic enzyme glucokinase (MODY2) and the others encoding transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4α (MODY1), HNF-1α (TCF1; MODY3), insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF-1; MODY4), HNF-1β (TCF2; MODY5), and NeuroD/β2 (MODY6).

HNF-1α gene mutations are found in the promoter region, DNA-binding domain, and transactivation domain, and lead to a loss of function. Some mutants such as the most frequently found P291fsinsC also act as dominant-negative proteins in vitro, i.e. they retain their DNA-binding domain and form nonfunctional dimers with wild-type HNF-1α (14Yamagata K.

These mice also demonstrated an inadequate β-cell mass for the degree of hyperglycemia, as well as a reduction in the ratio of β- to non-β cells. Principally, a defect in β-cell mass compensation can be caused by decreased neogenesis/proliferation rate, increased apoptosis rate, or both (18Finegood D.T. Scaglia L. Bonner-Weir S.

This study was therefore undertaken to establish whether HNF-1α function plays a role in the control of apoptosis in insulin secreting cells, and thereby the pathogenesis of MODY3 diabetes. This study demonstrates that dominant-negative suppression of HNF-1α function in INS-1 insulinoma cells activates the evolutionary conserved apoptotic cell death machinery via alterations in gene expression and mitochondrial function, and increases their sensitivity to ceramide-, but not to high glucose-induced apoptosis. N-Acetyl-d-erythrosphingosine (C2-ceramide) and staurosporine (STS) were purchased from Alexis (Grünberg, Germany). C2-dihydroceramide was from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany), and doxycycline from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). The broad spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) was obtained from Enzyme Systems (Dublin, CA). The caspase substrate acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC) was purchased from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany). All other chemicals came in analytical grade purity from Promega (Mannheim, Germany) or Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Rat INS-1 insulinoma cells overexpressing wild-type HNF-1α (number 15) (WT-HNF-1α) or a dominant-negative mutant of HNF-1α (SM6, number 31; DN-HNF-1α) under control of a doxycycline-dependent transcriptional activator have been described previously (28Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SM6 mutant contains a substitution of 83 amino acids in the HNF-1α DNA-binding domain, resulting in the formation of non-functional heterodimers with wild-type HNF-1α (29Nicosia A. Monaci P. Tomei L., De Francesco R. Nuzzo M. Stunnenberg H. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1225-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The level of HNF-1α expression can be tightly controlled by culturing the cells over defined time periods with doxycycline (28Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Maximal induction of HNF-1α is achieved at a concentration of 500 ng/ml (28Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). INS-1 cells conditionally overexpressing WT-HNF-1α and DN-HNF-1α, as well as parental INS-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Germany) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamin, 1 mm pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 10% fetal calf serum (PAA, Cölbe, Germany), 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were plated at a density of 6 × 104 cells/cm2. After 36 h, culture medium was supplemented with 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 6–60 h to induce the expression of WT- and DN-HNF-1α, respectively. In the experiments shown in Fig. 6 A, the doxycycline treatment was performed in the presence of varying glucose concentrations (0–25 mm). In the experiments shown in Fig. 6, B–D, WT- or DN-HNF-1α expression was induced for 14 or 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium, and cells were treated during the last 4 h with C2-ceramide, C2-dihydroceramide, or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.1%). To observe nuclear changes indicative of apoptosis, the chromatin-specific dye Hoechst 33258 was used. Cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C for 10 min, then permeabilized by treatment with a 19:1 mixture of ethanol/acetic acid at −20 °C for 15 min. Cells were stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) in PBS at room temperature for 20 min. Hoechst staining was viewed with an Eclipse TE 300 inverted-stage fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Düsseldorf, Germany) with the following optics: excitation, 340–380 nm; dichroic mirror, 400 nm; emission, 435–485 nm. Digital images of equal exposure were acquired using a 12-bit CCD camera (SPOT-2 camera; Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) and SPOT software version 2.2.1. Uptake of the membrane-impermeant dye propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) was used for the detection of cellular necrosis (optics: excitation 510–560 nm; dichroic mirror, 575 nm; emission, >590 nm). Cells were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 42 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5% CHAPS). Fifty μl of this lysate was added to 150 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 3 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5). The reaction buffer was supplemented with 10 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC, a fluorigenic substrate cleaved by caspase-3, but also by other executioner caspases including caspase-6 and -7 (30Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Zamboni R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Accumulation of AMC fluorescence was monitored over 120 min using a HTS fluorescent plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Langen, Germany) (excitation 380 nm, emission 465 nm). Fluorescence of blanks containing no cell lysate were subtracted from the values. Protein content was determined using the Pierce Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (KMF, Cologne, Germany). Caspase activity is expressed as change in arbitrary fluorescent units (A.U.) per μg of protein and hour. The mitochondrial membrane potential was quantified confocally using an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope attached to a confocal laser scanning unit equipped with a 488 nm argon laser and a ×60 oil fluorescence objective (Fluoview; Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). Cells were cultivated in 8-well chambered coverglasses (Nalge Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). After treatment with doxycycline, cells were incubated with 25 nm5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbocyanine iodide (JC-1; Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) in culture medium at 37 °C for 1 h. The cationic dye JC-1 distributes accross the plasma and mitochondrial membranes according to the Nernst equation. The fluorescence emission sprectrum exhibits a red shift due to formation of J-aggregates in a concentration-dependent manner in hyperpolarized mitochondria (31Smiley S.T. Reers M. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Lin M. Chen A. Smith T.W. Steele G.D., Jr. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3671-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). The slides were mounted onto a microscope stage equipped with a temperature-controlled inlay (HT200, Minitüb, Tiefenbach, Germany). To prevent evaporation the media was covered with embryo-tested paraffin oil. Images were obtained using Fluoview 2.0 software and Kalman averaged from two individual scans for each time point. After background subtraction the fluorescence intensity of J-aggregates (>570 nm) was devided by the intensity of the JC-1 monomers (510–540 nm) for each image. Quantitative analysis of the images was performed using the UTHSCSA Image Tool Programm (available from www.maxrad6.uthscsa.edu). Selective plasma membrane permeabilization with digitonin was used to analyze the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol (32Leist M. Volbracht C. Fava E. Nicotera P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This method obviates possible artifacts due to mechanical breakage of the outer mitochondrial membrane by Dounce homogenization. Culture plates with 106 cells per well were placed on ice. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and subsequently incubated in 100 μl of permeabilization buffer (210 mmd-mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mmsuccinate, 0.2 mm EGTA, 100 μg/ml digitonin, pH 7.2) for 5 min. The permeabilization buffer was transferred to a reaction tube and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g. The supernatant was transferred to a new reaction tube and protein content was determined using the Pierce BCA Micro Protein Assay kit. Equal amounts of protein were analyzed by Western blot analysis using 15% SDS-PAGE as described below. DN-HNF1α cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 48 h and continued for 8 h at the indicated glucose concentrations. Total RNA was extracted by the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method. Total RNA (20 μg) was denatured with glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide and separated on 1% agarose gels. Resolved RNA was blotted to nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by vacuum transfer (VacuGeneXL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by UV cross-linking. The membranes were prehybridized and then hybridized to 32P-labeled random primed cDNA probes according to standard protocols. cDNA fragments used as probes for cyclophilin, Bcl-xL, Bax, Bad, Bid, p21, and p27 mRNA detection were prepared by reverse transcriptase-PCR and confirmed by sequencing. HNF-1α cDNA was obtained from corresponding expression vector kindly provided by Dr. R. Cortese (Istituto Di Recerche Di Biologica Molecolare, Pomezia, Italy). Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in Tris-buffered saline containing SDS, glycerin, and protease inhibitors. Protein content was determined using the Pierce BCA Micro Protein Assay kit. Samples were supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol and denaturated at 95 °C for 5 min. An equal amount of protein (20–50 μg) was separated with 5–15% SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Protean BA 85; Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in blocking solution (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: a rabbit polyclonal anti-HNF-1α antibody diluted 1:5,000 (kindly provided by Dr. R. Cortese), a mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome cantibody (clone 7H8.2C12, 1:1000, Pharmingen Becton Dickinson, Hamburg, Germany), a rabbit polyclonal anti-active caspase-3 antibody (MF397) raised against p17/p12 x-ray crystallographic grade recombinant caspase-3 diluted 1:1,000 (33Black S.C.

Afterward, membranes were washed and incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1,000–1:5,000; Promega). Antibody-conjugated peroxidase activity was visualized using the SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). Membranes were stripped in standard stripping buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) at 60 °C for 30 min, washed twice and reprobed. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution, washed three times with PBS, permeabilized at room temperature in PBS containing 0.15% Tween 20 for 20 min, and then incubated with blocking solution (PBS with 8% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20) at room temperature for 30 min. Bcl-xL protein was detected using a mouse monoclonal anti-rat Bcl-x antibody (B22620, clone 4; Transduction Laboratories, Becton Dickinson, Lexington, KY) diluted 1:200, Bim was detected using a rat monoclonal anti-mouse Bim antibody recognizing BimEL, BimL, and BimS (MAB17001, clone 14A8; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) diluted 1:100, Bax was detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-human Bax antibody recognizing active Bax (06-499; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) (34Desagher S.

The secondary antibody was detected using Oregon Green-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:1,000. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were detected using Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), diluted 1:1,000. Control cultures were incubated with secondary antibody only.

The obtained PCR product was digested with BglII andEcoRI and cloned between the BglII andEcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). For transfections, INS-1 cells were plated onto 24-well tissue culture plates. One day later cells were transfected with plasmids pEGFP-C1-Bcl-xL or pEGFP-C1 using the F2 transfection reagent (Targeting Systems, Santee, CA). 300 ng of plasmid DNA and 0.3 μl of F2 reagent were diluted in 200 μl of RPMI medium under serum-free conditions and preincubated at room temperature for 20 min. Cultures were incubated with the DNA/F2-transfection mixture at 37 °C for 1 h. After 24 h, the culture medium was supplemented with 500 ng/ml doxycycline to induce DN-HNF-1α expression. After a further 48 h, nuclei were stained live with Hoechst 33258. Apoptotic nuclei and expression of Bcl-xL-EGFP and EGFP were observed by epifluorescence microscopy as described above. In co-transfection experiments, INS-1 cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1 (40 ng) and either pSFFV-Neo or pSFFV-Bcl-xL (280 ng) (35Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T.

For statistical comparison, ANOVA and subsequent Tukey's test were employed. p Values smaller than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Using a reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator system we have previously shown that dominant-negative suppression of HNF-1α function inhibits the expression of HNF-1α target genes involved in glucose and lipid homeostasis (15Wang H. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4257-4264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In subsequent experiments, we noted that under conditions of prolonged induction of DN-HNF-1α (>48 h), INS-1 cells frequently detached from the substratum and floated in the culture medium. Floating cells exhibited a round, shrunken morphology reminiscent of apoptosis, suggesting that dominant-negative suppression of HNF-1α may have also influenced the expression of genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis. To investigate the relationship between induction of DN-HNF-1α and alterations in cell morphology in more detail, expression of WT-HNF-1α and DN-HNF-1α was induced in INS-1 cells by treatment with doxycycline for 6, 14, 24, 48, and 60 h. Apoptotic cell morphology was assessed in parallel by Hoechst staining of nuclear chromatin. Treatment with 500 ng/ml doxycycline led to a rapid induction of WT-HNF-1α and DN-HNF-1α in INS-1 cells stably transfected with the reverse tetracycline-dependent transactivator system, displaying similar kinetics (Fig.1, A and B). In each case, significant induction was already evident after 14 h of doxycycline treatment. Nuclei of non-induced control cells exhibited a regular, oval shape and a septate pattern of blue fluorescence (Fig. 1,C and D). The nuclear morphology of INS-1 cells remained unchanged at 6 and 14 h after induction of DN-HNF-1α (not shown). Twenty-four h after doxycycline treatment, the majority of cells induced to overexpress DN-HNF-1α also displayed regular nuclear Hoechst staining and a normal cell morphology (Fig. 1 D). Occasionally, however, we detected cells with a typical nuclear apoptotic morphology characterized by increased chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. By 48 h, apoptotic nuclear changes became visible in many DN-HNF-1α-expressing INS-1 cells. By 60 h, non-apoptotic, apoptotic, late-stage apoptotic/enucleated cells, as well as floating cells could be detected in the cultures (not shown). Induction of WT-HNF-1α for 24, 48, or 60 h, in contrast, did not lead to any significant changes in nuclear morphology (Fig.1 C and data not shown). These results suggested that prolonged, dominant-negative suppression of HNF-1α function is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in INS-1 cells. Caspases play a central role in the activation and execution of apoptotic cell death. Based on their structure and substrate specificity, caspases can be subdivided into three subfamilies: (i) upstream or apical caspases containing a large NH2-terminal region and specific motifs that are required for their aggregation and autoactivation; (ii) downstream or effector caspases that are responsible for the execution of apoptotic cell death; and (iii) caspases involved in the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (36Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). To assess whether activation of executioner caspases was involved in DN-HNF1α-induced cell death, we measured caspase activity by monitoring the cleavage of a fluorigenic caspase substrate by extracts from doxycycline-treated INS-1 cells. Ac-DEVD-AMC is cleaved most efficiently by caspase-3, the major executioner caspase in most cell types, but also by other executioner caspases (30Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M.

https://openalex.org/W2076990376,"Differential display of hippocampal tissue after entorhinal cortex lesion (ECL) revealed decreases in mRNA encoding the neuronal hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated channel HCN1. In situ hybridization confirmed that hippocampal transcripts of HCN1, but not HCN2/3/4, are down-regulated after ECL. Expression recovered at approximately 21 days after lesion (dal). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated a corresponding regulation of HCN1 protein expression in CA1-CA3 dendrites, hilar mossy cells and interneurons, and granule cells. Patch-clamp recordings in the early phase after lesion from mossy cells and hilar interneurons revealed an increase in the fast time constant of current activation and a profound negative shift in voltage activation of Ih. Whereas current activation recovered at 30 dal, the voltage activation remained hyperpolarized in mossy cells and hilar interneurons. Granule cells, however, were devoid of any detectable somatic Ih currents. Hence, denervation of the hippocampus decreases HCN1 and concomitantly the Ih activity in hilar neurons, and the recovery of h-current activation kinetics occurs parallel to postlesion sprouting."

CCK is composed of several molecular variants, the octapeptide (CCK-8: Asp-Tyr(SO3H)-Met-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2) being the major fully active one (1Villanueva M.L. Collins S.M. Jensen R.T.

Two CCK receptors have been characterized pharmacologically, biologically and subsequently cloned, the CCK1 receptor (abbreviated CCK1R, previously named CCKA receptor) and the CCK2 receptor (abbreviated CCK2R, previously named CCK-B/gastrin receptor), which both belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (3de Weerth A.

Commun. 1992; 189: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The CCK1R and CCK2R can exist in several conformational states, which bind CCK with high, low, and very low affinities, respectively, and share the functional coupling to phospholipase C, via binding to heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein(s) (5Talkad V.D.

CCK1R-mediated effects include control of gallbladder contraction, pancreatic exocrine secretion, gastric emptying and gut motility, and satiety (8Silvente-Poirot S. Dufresne M. Vaysse N. Fourmy D.

The wide spectrum of biological functions regulated by the CCK1R makes it a candidate target for a therapeutic approach in a number of diseases related to nutrient assimilation. This led a number of academic and pharmaceutical research groups to design specific and highly potent agonists and antagonists for this receptor (8Silvente-Poirot S. Dufresne M. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 9Wank S.A. Am. J.

Dufresne M. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 9Wank S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G607-G613PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, within each chemical family of CCK1R ligands, compounds having close structures are agonists, partial agonists, or antagonists, indicating that appropriate modifications within the pharmacophore switches an agonist to an antagonist and vice versa. This can be illustrated with both peptide and non-peptide ligands of CCK1R. For instance, JMV 179, a CCK heptapeptide analogue in which the C-terminal amidated phenylalanine and the l-tryptophan have been replaced by a phenylethyl ester moiety and a d-tryptophan, respectively, is a full CCK1R antagonist (10Lignon M.F. Galas M.C. Rodriguez M. Laur J. Aumelas A. Martinez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7226-7231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This antagonist has been converted to JMV 180, a peptide exhibiting dual agonistic/antagonistic activity, by exchanging the d-tryptophan for anl-tryptophan (7Williams J.A. Blevins G.T., Jr. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 701-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11Galas M.C. Lignon M.F. Rodriguez M. Mendre C. Fulcrand P. Laur J. Martinez J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: G176-G182PubMed Google Scholar). Another interesting example came from the discovery of the non-peptide CCK1R agonist, SR-146,131, by chemical modification of the CCK1R antagonist, SR-27,897 (12Gully D. Frehel D. Marcy C. Spinazze A. Lespy L. Neliat G. Maffrand J.P. Le Fur G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 232: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Bignon E. Alonso R. Arnone M. Boigegrain R. Brodin R.

Ther. 1999; 289: 752-761PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). These examples, which could probably be extended to multiple G protein-coupled receptors, raise the important questions of whether closely related ligands having opposite biological activities share the same binding site and of which intrinsic mechanism(s) at the binding site level govern(s) G protein-coupled receptor functioning. One of our recent objectives has been to define the agonist binding site on the CCK1R and to identify interactions between critical residues of that binding site and chemical functions of the pharmacophoric domain of CCK (Figs. 1 and 3). Amino acids within three regions of the CCK1R were identified as belonging to the binding site for CCK. Trp-39 and Gln-40, located at the top of transmembrane helix I, were shown to interact directly with the N-terminal portion of CCK (14Kennedy K. Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Frehel D. Gully D. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2920-2926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Met-195 and Arg-197, located in the second extracellular loop, were then shown to interact with the sulfated tyrosine (15Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Silvente-Poirot S. Maigret B. Gouilleux L. Fehrentz J.A.

Bouisson M. Fehrentz J.A. Moroder L. Gully D. Martinez J. Vaysse N. Fourmy A.D. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2347-2354PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Arg-336 and Asn-333, at the top of helix VI, were demonstrated to pair with the Asp carboxylate and the C-terminal amide of CCK, respectively (17Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Fehrentz J.A. Poirot S. Maigret B. Moroder L. Gully D. Martinez J. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20457-20464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The first two identified amino acids of the CCK1R (Trp-39 and Gln-40) contribute weakly to CCK1R affinity for and response to CCK, whereas all others play a more critical role because of their interaction with residues of CCK, which are essential for both binding and biological activity of CCK. However, contact points within the CCK1R binding site for other key residues of CCK such as the Trp, Met, and Phe residues have not yet been identified. To progress in the mapping of the CCK1R binding site(s), the three-dimensional model of the CCK1R·CCK complex was optimized, leading to the identification of putative amino acids involved in the interaction with the Met and Phe residues of the ligand CCK. Mutation of candidate residues and extensive characterization of the resulting mutants allowed us to position the C-terminal biological part of CCK in hydrophobic pockets formed by aromatic and nonaromatic amino acids located in the upper half of transmembrane helices III, V, VI, and VII. Our data, therefore, refute the model of the CCK1R·CCK complex proposed by other investigators in which the C terminus of CCK interacts with an amino acid residue (Trp-39) of helix I (18Ding X.Q.

Furthermore, binding site for the non-peptide agonist SR-146,131 was identified and experimentally validated as overlapping with that of the C-terminal tripeptide of CCK. Finally, the role of Met-121 located on helix III in the activation of the CCK1R by agonists was demonstrated. The C-terminal nonapeptide analogue (Nle)-CCK-9 (Fig. 1) was synthesized as described previously (19Moroder L. Wilschowitz L. Gemeiner M. Gohring W. Knof S. Scharf R. Thamm P. Gardner J.D. Solomon T.E. Wunsch E. Hoppe-Seylers Z. Physiol. Chem. 1981; 362: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The other analogues of Fig. 1 were synthesized on an ACT 396 synthesizer by applying the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/ter-butyl chemistry and chlorotrityl resin (PepChem). Upon deprotection and resin cleavage with trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/triethylsilane (9:0.5:0.5) at 0 °C, the crude products were precipitated by methyltert-butyl ether/hexane (2:1) and purified by preparative RP-HPLC (250/20 Nucleosil 300/5 C18; Machery & Nagel) and characterized by analytical RP-HPLC (linear gradient acetonitrile/2% H3PO4 from 5 to 90% in 15 min; 125/4 Nucleosil 100/5 C18; Machery & Nagel) and ESI-MS (API 165; PerkinElmer Life Sciences); (Ala-7)-CCK: homogeneous on analytical RP-HPLC (t R = 6,7 min); ESI-MS: m/z: 1209.4 [M + H+]; M r = 1209.5 calculated for C52H69N14O18S1; (Ala-9)-CCK: homogeneous on analytical RP-HPLC (t R = 6,5 min); ESI-MS: m/z: 1176.2 [M + H+]; M r = 1175.5 calculated for C49H71N14O18S1; (Gln-7)-CCK: homogeneous on analytical RP-HPLC (t R = 7,6 min); ESI-MS: m/z: 1266.8 [M + H+]; M r = 1266.5 calculated for C54H72N15O19S1.

All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. The model of empty CCK1R was built using the transmembrane (TM) helical arrangement found in the bacteriorhodopsin crystal structure as starting point (21Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckmann E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (2520) Google Scholar). It was then modified according to the rhodopsin crystal structure (22Unger V.M.

Extracellular and intracellular loops connecting the transmembrane helices were then added to the preliminary seven-helix bundle, and the structural model was optimized by the use of simulated annealing procedures. The entire system was finally relaxed and submitted to a 1-ns molecular dynamics with possible translational and rotational movements of individual TM helices taken into account. The final model respects most transmembrane arrangements found in the recent x-ray structure of rhodopsin (23Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A., Le Trong I.

For docking of CCK ligand into the CCK1R binding site, experimental data that identified contact points between residues Trp-39 and Gln-40 and the N-terminal moiety of CCK served as a first constraint to place CCK within the CCK1R grove (14Kennedy K. Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Frehel D. Gully D. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2920-2926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In a first step, manual docking was achieved by taking into account molecular electrostatic potentials at the top of the receptor grove. The resulting complex was submitted to annealing molecular dynamics calculations. The resulting theoretical positioning of CCK into the CCK1R binding site was experimentally validated by two-dimensional site-directed mutagenesis. By doing so, Met-195–Arg-197, Arg-336, and Asn-333 were shown to belong the CCK1R binding site and to interact with the sulfated tyrosine of CCK, the Asp-8 carboxylate, and the C-terminal amide, respectively (15Gigoux V.

The program package (Insight II, Discover, Homology, Biopolymer) from Molecular Simulations Inc. (San Diego, CA) was used for all the calculations. Mutant receptor cDNAs were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, France) using the human CCK1R cDNAs cloned into pRFENeo vector as template (25Kennedy K. Escrieut C. Dufresne M. Clerc P. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were designed to include a silent restriction site to facilitate analysis of mutant constructs by restriction endonuclease digestion. The presence of the desired and the absence of undesired mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing of both cDNA strands (Applied Biosystems). COS-7 cells (1.5 × 106) were plated onto 10-cm culture dishes and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum (complete medium) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After overnight incubation, cells were transfected with 2.5 μg/plate of pRFENeo vectors containing the cDNA for the wild-type or mutated CCK1 receptors, using a modified DEAE-dextran method. Cells were transferred to 24-well plates at a density of 80,000–150,000 cells/well 24 h after transfection. Approximately 24 h after the transfer of transfected cells to 24-well plates, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.95, 0.1% BSA and then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% BSA with either 71 pm125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)-CCK-9 or 1.83 nm[3H]SR-27,897 in the presence or the absence of competing agonists or antagonists. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.95, containing 2% BSA, and cell-associated radioligand was collected with 0.1 n NaOH added to each well. The radioactivity was directly counted in a γ counter (Auto-Gamma, Packard, Downers Grove, IL) or added to scintillant and counted for the tritiated radioligand. Approximately 24 h after the transfer to 24-well plates and following overnight incubation in complete medium containing 2 μCi/mlmyo-2-[3H]inositol, the transfected cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated for 30 min in 1 ml/well Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm LiCl at 37 °C. The cells were washed with PI buffer at pH 7.45: phosphate-buffered saline containing 135 mmNaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm LiCl, 11.1 mm glucose, and 0.5% BSA. The cells were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 0.3 ml of PI buffer with or without ligands at various concentrations. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of methanol/chlorhydric acid to each well, and the content was transferred to a column (Dowex AG 1-X8, formate form, Bio-Rad) for the determination of inositol phosphates. The columns were washed twice with 3 ml of distilled water and twice more with 2 ml of 5 mm sodium tetraborate, 60 mm sodium formate. The content of each column was eluted by addition of 2.5 ml of 1m ammonium formate, 100 mm formic acid. 0.5 ml of the eluted fraction was added to scintillant, and β radioactivity was counted. Approximately 65 h after transfection, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.95, scraped from the plate in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1% bacitracin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and frozen in liquid N2. After thawing at 37 °C, the cells were subjected to another cycle of freeze/thawing and then centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, containing 115 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1% bacitracin, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (binding buffer); aliquoted; and stored at −80 °C until use. Membrane protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. To assess the effect of GTPγS on CCK binding, membranes from transfected COS-7 cells (0.4–4 μg of proteins) were incubated with 71 pm125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)-CCK-9 in the absence or in the presence of increasing concentrations GTPγS in binding buffer for 120 min at 25 °C. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 1 μm CCK. Previous structure-activity studies using synthetic replicates of CCK and pancreatic acini from rodents, a biological model naturally expressing CCK1R, have clearly shown the importance of both Met and Phe residues for binding and activity of CCK; however, no such study has been reported for human CCK1R in any expression system (26Jensen R.T. Wank S.A. Rowley W.H. Sato S. Gardner J.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 418-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first determined to what extent the Met and Phe side chains contribute to the affinity of CCK for human CCK1R expressed in COS-7 cells and to its capacity to induce production of total inositol phosphates. As shown in Fig.2, replacement of Met-7 in CCK by an Ala residue caused 4000- and 390-fold decrease in affinity and potency, respectively. In contrast, substitution of Met-7 by Nle did not affect affinity and potency of CCK. Furthermore, exchange of Phe for Ala was found to induce a 4900- and 2700-fold decrease in affinity and potency of the analogues, respectively. The efficacies of (Nle-7)-CCK, (Met-7)-CCK, and (Ala-7)-CCK were comparable, whereas that of (Ala-9)-CCK reached only 40% referred to the parent analogue (Nle-7)-CCK. Hence, both Met-7 and Phe-9 side chains contribute significantly to receptor binding and activation potency of CCK, confirming data obtained previously on receptors from rodents and guinea pig (27Marseigne I. Dor A. Begue D. Reibaud M. Zundel J.L. Blanchard J.C. Pelaprat D. Roques B.P. J. Med. Chem. 1988; 31: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 28Spanarkel M. Martinez J. Briet C. Jensen R.T. Gardner J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6746-6749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results also confirm that replacement of Met-7 with Nle does not affect affinity and activity of CCK. Considering the major anchoring points of CCK inside the receptor discovered in our previous studies, it appears that the Nle/Met-7 residue is located in the vicinity of a hydrophobic pocket constituted by residues Leu-50, Ile-51, Leu-53, Pro-101, Val-125, Met-121, Ileu-352, and Leu-356. In the model of the (WT)-CCK1R, both Nle-7 or Met-7 side chains are positioned in the same way. The Phe-9 aromatic side chain of CCK is also positioned into a well defined cavity delineated by Phe-330 at the bottom, and Pro-177, Val-125, Leu-214, Ile-329 around Phe-330, which itself belongs to a large aromatic cluster constituted by the side chains of Cys-94, Phe-130, Trp-166, Phe-170, Phe-218, Phe-322, Phe-323, Trp-326, and Tyr-360. These two pockets are connected via the Val-125 side chain so that helix movements changing the structure of one of them may have consequences on the other. Examination of the organization of the two clusters in the three-dimensional model of the CCK1R·CCK complex suggests that not only a single, but several hydrophobic residues are contributing to the binding energy between Nle/Met-7 or Phe side chains of CCK and the CCK1R. As a consequence and unlike the charged residues of the binding pocket that were characterized previously, a mutation of only one of these amino acid residues of the CCK1R was not expected to induce changes in affinity and biological potency of the CCK1R to an extent comparable with effects caused by replacements of Nle/Met or Phe in CCK. Among all residues forming hydrophobic clusters around the Nle/Met-7 and Phe-9 side chains, in a first instance those in closest contact were chosen for mutagenesis experiments (Fig. 3). These were exchanged for amino acids lacking the chemical functions thought to be responsible for the interactions. In addition, Met-121 and Ile-329, which appear to be important for the equilibrium within the hydrophobic clusters surrounding Nle/Met-7 and Phe-9 of CCK, were each exchanged for more bulky and hydrophobic residues, namely Val and Phe, respectively. In a first series of experiments, COS-7 cells expressing mutated receptors were assayed for binding of the non-peptide antagonist [3H]SR-27,897. Indeed, binding of this antagonist, unlike that of an agonist, offers the advantage of allowing detection of CCK1R independent of the coupling state to G protein(s), thus yielding accurate expression levels of all mutants (15Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Silvente-Poirot S. Maigret B. Gouilleux L. Fehrentz J.A. Gully D. Moroder L. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol.

No binding of [3H]SR-27,897 was found with the (I329F)-CCK1R mutant, a result that could be interpreted at this stage of the study either by an absence of expression of the mutant or by a direct or indirect effect of the mutation on receptor affinity for the ligand. Results with all other CCK1R mutants confirmed their expression at COS-7 cell surface at levels varying from 0.6 to 10.0 pmol/106 cells, which permitted further characterization. In addition, the binding data clearly revealed that all mutants (except (I329F)-CCK1R) bind the non-peptide antagonist with an affinity very close to that of (WT)-CCK1R. This finding indicates that the mutations did not dramatically disturb the conformational state of the CCK1R and that the mutated residues are not directly involved in the binding pocket of the antagonist SR-27,897.Table IEffects of CCK1R mutations on CCK1R expression and affinity for the non-peptide antagonist, SR-27,897 and the peptide agonist, CCKCCK1RSR 27897 bindingCCK bindingK dFmutB maxHigh affinity sitesLow affinity sitesB maxK d (1)FmutK d (2)FmutHigh affinityLow affinitynmpmol/10 6 cellsnmnmpmol/10 6 cellsWT3.3 ± 0.51.09.2 ± 1.61.20 ± 0.051.071 ± 141.00.18 ± 0.024.9 ± 0.7L50A3.1 ± 0.70.96.3 ± 0.51.1 ± 0.51.051 ± 80.70.05 ± 0.032.2 ± 0.6I51A6.4 ± 3.81.97.9 ± 0.92.0 ± 0.51.744 ± 30.70.30 ± 0.052.2 ± 0.6L53A1.9 ± 0.60.65.6 ± 1.51.4 ± 0.71.252 ± 120.70.14 ± 0.052.7 ± 0.4C94L7.4 ± 2.82.24.9 ± 0.974.0 ± 5.062ND3.1 ± 0.3NDM121V6.2 ± 1.41.96.5 ± 3.419.0 ± 1.316ND7.0 ± 0.6NDM121A8.9 ± 2.62.710.0 ± 3.32.1 ± 0.21.8ND13.2 ± 1.4NDI352A5.4 ± 11.64.7 ± 0.2No bindingL356A4.0 ± 0.31.25.1 ± 0.40.97 ± 0.030.8561 ± 11480.016 ± 0.0044.4 ± 1.9V12"
https://openalex.org/W2101555566,"Sera from patients with chronic Chagas heart disease recognize the carboxyl-terminal regions of the Trypanosoma cruzi ribosomal P proteins defined by B cell epitopes P013 (EDDDDDFGMGALF) and R13 (EEEDDDMGFGLFD) corresponding to the T. cruzi ribosomal P0 (TcP0) and P2beta (TcP2beta) proteins, respectively. It has been hypothesized that both epitopes may induce antibodies that cross-react and stimulate the beta1-adrenoreceptor. However, no proof as to their pathogenicity has been obtained. We investigated the consequences of immunizing mice with either TcP0 or TcP2beta proteins. Of 24 immunized animals, 16 generated antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal end of the corresponding protein, 13 of which showed an altered ECG (P<0.001, 81%). Immunization with TcP0 induced anti-P013 antibodies that bind to and stimulate cardiac G-protein-coupled receptors and are linked to the induction of supraventricular arrhythmia, repolarization, and conduction abnormalities as monitored by serial electrocardiographic analysis. In contrast, immunization with TcP2beta generated anti-R13 antibodies with an exclusive beta1-adrenergic-stimulating activity whose appearance strictly correlated with the recording of supraventricular tachycardia and death. These findings demonstrate that anti-P antibodies are arrhythmogenic in the setting of a normal heart, since no inflammatory lesions or fibrosis were evident to light microscopic examination."
https://openalex.org/W2060640204,"Sequence-specific DNA recognition can be achieved by the use of triplex-forming molecules, namely, oligonucleotides (TFO) and peptide nucleic acids (PNAs). They have been used to regulate transcription or induce genomic DNA modifications at a selected site in cells and, recently, in vivo. We have determined the conditions under which a triplex structure can inhibit DNA replication in cells. An oligopyrimidine.oligopurine sequence suitable for triplex formation was inserted in a plasmid on both sides of the SV40 origin of replication. This insert-containing plasmid was replicated in COS-1 cells together with the parent plasmid, and the ratio between the corresponding replicated DNAs was quantitated. Selective inhibition of replication of the insert-containing plasmid can be ascribed to ligand binding to the oligopyrimidine.oligopurine sequence. Inhibition of DNA replication was observed using triplex-forming molecules that induce either covalent binding at the double-stranded target sequence (with TFO-psoralen conjugate and irradiation) or noncovalent triplex formation after strand displacement (with bis-PNA). In contrast, in the absence of covalent cross-linking, TFOs (which have been shown to arrest transcription elongation) did not act on replication. These results open new perspectives for future design and use of specific inhibitors of intracellular DNA information processing."
https://openalex.org/W1991902444,"To achieve a sequence-specific DNA cleavage by topoisomerase I, derivatives of the antitumor drug camptothecin have been covalently linked to triple helix-forming oligonucleotides that bind in a sequence-specific manner to the major groove of double-helical DNA. Triplex formation at the target sequence positions the drug selectively at the triplex site, thereby stimulating topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage at this site. In a continuous effort to optimize this strategy, a broad set of conjugates consisting of (i) 16–20-base-long oligonucleotides, (ii) alkyl linkers of variable length, and (iii) camptothecin derivatives substituted on the A or B quinoline ring were designed and synthesized. Analysis of the cleavage sites at nucleotide resolution reveals that the specificity and efficacy of cleavage depends markedly on the length of both the triple-helical structure and the linker between the oligonucleotide and the poison. The optimized hybrid molecules induced strong and highly specific cleavage at a site adjacent to the triplex. Furthermore, the drug-stabilized DNA-topoisomerase I cleavage complexes were shown to be more resistant to salt-induced reversal than the complexes induced by camptothecin alone.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 2Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, the covalent intermediate is barely detectable, because a fast religation step occurs after relaxation of the DNA constraints. A number of drugs, such as the antitumor alkaloid camptothecin (CPT),1 can convert topoisomerase I into a cell poison by blocking the religation step, thereby enhancing the formation of persistent DNA breaks responsible for cell death (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 3Pommier Y. Pourquier P. Fan Y. Strumberg D. Biochim. Biophys.

However, topoisomerase I poisons display a weak sequence specificity. Mainly one or two nucleotides on the 3′ and 5′-side of the cleavage site (essentially thymine-guanine steps in the case of CPT) represent the only recognition elements. As a result, drugs like CPT induce massive nonspecific DNA damage in cells and can affect any gene within the genome. The identification, over the last decade, of genes that play a key role in the progression and maintenance of a specific disease, such as oncogenes and tumor suppressor, calls for the development of drugs able to regulate the expression and functions of these genes. For this reason, the design of molecules that bind to specific sequences in DNA is urgently needed. To direct the topoisomerase I enzymatic reaction to particular sites, topoisomerase I poisons, including camptothecin and rebeccamycin derivatives, have been covalently attached to sequence-specific DNA ligands, such as triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFO) (5Matteucci M.

We report here on the effect of the length of the triple-helical structure and the linker arm between the TFO and the poison, as well as the influence of the drug orientation with respect to the topoisomerase I cleavage site. The DNA binding and topoisomerase I-mediated cleaving properties of the conjugates were investigated by PAGE at nucleotide resolution, and their effects on the stability of the topoisomerase I-DNA complexes were also investigated. Altogether the results attest unequivocally that the recognition and cleavage of DNA by topoisomerase I can be fully controlled by the attachment of a CPT-type poison to a TFO, but the structure of the hybrid molecule must be precisely adapted to direct the cleavage reaction to the target site. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec and purified using quick spin columns and Sephadex G-25 fine (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 25 °C using molar extinction coefficients at 260 nm calculated from a nearest neighbor model (10Cantor C.R. Warshaw M.M. Shapiro H. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 1059-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The nomenclature of the oligonucleotides and conjugates is as follows. The abbreviation TFO is followed by a number referring to the length of the oligonucleotide, followed by the letter L (for linker) and the number of carbon atoms in the linker, and finally, by the denomination of the camptothecin derivative (10CPT for 10-carboxycamptothecin or 7CPT for 7-(2-aminoethyl)camptothecin). For example, TFO20-L4–10CPT stands for the 20-mer TFO linked through the diaminobutyl spacer to 10-carboxycamptothecin. The plasmid pBSK(+/−) was bought from Promega, and the 77-bp target duplex was inserted between the BamHI andEcoRI sites. The digestion of the plasmid byPvuII and EcoRI yielded a 324-mer fragment suitable for 3′-end labeling by the Klenow polymerase and [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The detailed procedures for isolation, purification, and labeling of this duplex DNA fragment have been previously described (11Marchand C. Bailly C. Nguyen C.H. Bisagni E. Garestier T. Hélène C.

The final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration never exceeded 0.3% (v/v) in all assays. 10-Carboxycamptothecin (kindly provided by Dr. Mark Matteucci, Gilead Sciences; structure in Fig. 2) was conjugated to the terminal amino group of a diaminoalkyl linker arm at the 3′-end of the oligonucleotide as described in Ref. 6Arimondo P.B.

To a suspension of 100 mg (0.29 mmol) of camptothecin and 160 mg (0.58 mmol) of FeSO4·7 H2O in 2 ml of ethanol and 4 ml of H2O was added dropwise 2 ml of H2SO4. This suspension was cooled to 0 °C and then stirred and treated dropwise with 1 ml of 30% H2O2. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h and then diluted with water, which afforded a precipitate. The precipitate, which consisted mostly of CPT and 7-methyl CPT in addition to the desired product, was triturated with 10% EtOH in CHCl3, and the combined extract was concentrated to afford the crude product. This material was purified by chromatography on silica gel; elution was effected with MeOH-CHCl3 mixtures (1:99 MeOH-CHCl3 → 3:97 MeOH-CHCl3). The desired 7-(2-hydroxyethyl)CPT (2) crystallized from ethanol as a colorless microcrystalline solid: yield, 19 mg (17%); silica gel TLCRf = 0.09 (7:3 CHCl3-acetone); mass spectrum (chemical ionization), m/z 393 (M+H)+.

The crude product was purified on a silica gel column (8 × 1.3 cm); elution was carried out with 1% MeOH in CHCl3.

The reaction mixture was stirred under argon at room temperature for 24 h and then concentrated under diminished pressure. The residue was suspended in CHCl3, filtered to remove unreacted sodium azide, and then concentrated under diminished pressure. The residue was purified by chromatography on a silica gel column (8 × 1.3 cm); elution was carried out with CHCl3-acetone mixtures (1% → 3% acetone in CHCl3). This afforded 7-(2-azidoethyl)CPT (4) contaminated with a small amount of 7-vinylcamptothecin: yield 141 mg (86%); silica gel TLC Rf = 0.35 (7:3 CHCl3-acetone); 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 1.02 (t, 3H), 1.88 (m, 2H), 3.41 (m, 2H), 3.77 (br, 1H), 3.82 (t, 2H), 5.34 (s, 2H), 5.52 (AB quartet, 2H), 7.67 (s, 1H), 7.69 (t, 1H), 7.82 (t, 1H), 8.04 (d, 1H), and 8.26 (d, 1H); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 7.8, 29.6, 31.6, 50.0, 50.8, 66.4, 72.7, 98.4, 118.8, 122.9, 126.9, 128.2, 128.9, 130.4, 130.9, 139.9, 146.6, 149.2, 150.1, 151.8, 157.6, and 173.9; mass spectrum (chemical ionization),m/z 418 (M+H)+. A solution containing 141 mg (0.34 mmol) of 7-(2-azidoethyl)CPT (4) and 94 mg of 10% palladium-on-carbon in 28 ml of EtOH and 1.1 ml of concentrated HCl was stirred under a H2atmosphere at room temperature for 20 h. The reaction mixture was filtered through Celite to remove the catalyst, and then the filtrate was washed with CHCl3 to remove the by-product 7-ethylCPT, and then the aqueous solution was concentrated to dryness under diminished pressure. The residue was purified by chromatography on a silica gel column (8 × 1.3 cm); elution was carried out with MeOH-CHCl3 mixtures (1% → 40% MeOH in CHCl3) to afford 7-(2-aminoethyl)CPT (5) as a pale yellow powder: yield 50 mg (38%); silica gel TLCRf = 0.11 (1:1 CHCl3-MeOH);1H NMR (Me2SO-d6) δ 0.86 (t, 3H), 1.86 (m, 2H), 3.15 (m, 2H), 3.60 (m, 2H), 5.39 (s, 2H), 5.44 (s, 2H), 6.55 (br, 1H), 7.34 (s, 1H), 7.76 (t, 1H), 7.88 (t, 1H), 8.19 (d, 1H), 8.43 (d, 1H), and 8.49 (br, 2H); 13C NMR (Me2SO-d6) δ 7.8, 27.1, 30.3, 38.1, 50.0, 65.3, 72.4, 96.8, 119.1, 124.1, 126.9, 128.0, 129.9, 130.0, 130.2, 139.1, 145.9, 148.5, 150.1, 152.1, 156.8, and 172.5; mass spectrum (chemical ionization), m/z 392 (M+H)+. 150 μg of 3′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides, TFO16 and TFO18 (see Fig. 2), were conjugated to the 7CPT via γ-aminocaproic acid linker according to the methods described in Ref. 12Grimm G. Boutorine A. Hélène C. Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2000; 19: 1943-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar. After precipitation as hexadecyltrimethylammonium salt, the oligonucleotide was then dissolved in 50 μl of dry Me2SO. Methylaminopyridine (5 μg) and dipyridyl disulfide and triphenylphosphine solutions (25 μl each 1.2 m in Me2SO) were added. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the activated oligonucleotide was precipitated with 2% LiClO4 in acetone, rinsed with acetone, and dissolved in 50 μl of aqueous solution of γ-aminocaproic acid (6 mg) with 5 μl of triethylamine. After 2 h of incubation the oligonucleotide was precipitated with LiClO4 in acetone, followed by precipitation with ethanol. The terminal carboxyl group of the linker attached to the 3′-end of the oligonucleotides was again activated with dipyridyl disulfide/triphenylphosphine as described above and then reacted with the NH2 group of the ethyl chain of the 7CPT (see Fig. 2). After precipitation with LiClO4/acetone, the conjugate was purified by reverse phase HPLC using a linear acetonitrile gradient (0–80% CH3CN in 0.2 m(NH4)OAc). The average yield was 60%. The oligonucleotide-drug conjugates were characterized by UV spectroscopy. The radiolabeled 324-bp target duplex (50 nm) was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 30 μg of bovine serum albumin, in the presence of the TFO (at the indicated concentration) to form the triplex (total reaction volume, 20 μl). To analyze the topoisomerase I DNA cleavage products, 10 units of enzyme (Invitrogen) were added to the duplex, preincubated as described above with either the TFO or/and the drugs, and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The DNA-topoisomerase I cleavage complexes were dissociated by the addition of SDS (final concentration, 0.25%) and of proteinase K (Sigma) to 250 μg/ml, followed by incubation for 35 min at 56 °C. After ethanol precipitation, all of the samples were resuspended in 6 μl of formamide, heated at 90 °C for 4 min, and then chilled on ice for 4 min before being loaded onto a denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) containing 7.5m urea in 1× TBE buffer (50 mm Tris base, 55 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). To quantitate the extent of cleavage, the gels were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics 445SI PhosphorImager. For the determination of cleavage levels, normalization relative to total loading was performed. To investigate the reversal of the drug-induced cleavage complexes, after incubation with topoisomerase I and prior addition of SDS and proteinase K, increasing concentrations of NaCl were added as indicated for 5 min. The samples were then processed as described above. The bases of the 3′ and 5′ termini of the analyzed cleavage sites were numbered −1 and +1, respectively. The DNA template for the DNase I protection assay on the oligopyrimidine-containing strand of the target was obtained as described above. 1 μl of DNase I (final concentration, 0.2 mg/ml; Sigma) diluted in 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmMnCl2, and 20 mm NaCl was added to the radiolabeled duplex and preincubated for 1 h at 30 °C in the buffer described above in the absence or presence of TFO. The reaction and analysis were performed as described in Ref. 7Arimondo P.B. Bailly C. Boutorine A. Prudhomme M. Sun J.-S. Garestier T. Hélène C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2000; 8: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar. The synthesis of 7-(2-aminoethyl)CPT (7CPT), a new CPT derivative required for the preparation of TFO-CPT conjugates attached to the alkaloid via the 7-position, was carried out as outlined in Fig.1 starting from camptothecin itself. Thus treatment of CPT (1) with FeSO4, H2O2, and H2SO4 in aqueous EtOH afforded 7-(2-hydroxyethyl)CPT (2), as described previously (13Sawada S. Nokata K. Furata T. Yokokura T. Miyasako T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1991; 39: 2574-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Following activation of the primary OH group as a tosylate, treatment with sodium azide inN,N-dimethylformamide afforded 7-(2-azidoethyl)CPT (4) in 81% overall yield from hydroxyethylCPT derivative 2. Hydrogenolysis then provided the 7-(2-aminoethyl)camptothecin (7CPT (5)). The target DNA sequence used in this study and the newly designed TFO-CPT conjugates are shown in Fig.2. The 77-bp target duplex, containing a central 23-bp oligopyrimidine· oligopurine target sequence for triplex formation, was inserted between the BamHI andEcoRI sites of plasmid pBSK(+/−), and a resulting 324-mer 3′-end 32P-radiolabeled fragment was used for topoisomerase I DNA cleavage and DNA binding assays. We have used this system previously to study triplex formation with 16-nucleotide-long oligomers (underlined and bold in Fig. 2) (6Arimondo P.B. Bailly C. Boutorine A. Sun J.S. Garestier T. Hélène C. C. R. Acad. Sci. III/Life Sciences. 1999; 322: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Arimondo P.B. Bailly C. Boutorine A. Prudhomme M. Sun J.-S. Garestier T. Hélène C.

Chem. 2001; 12: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The TFO moiety of the conjugates consists of 16–20-nucleotide-long oligomers (TFO) containing 5-methyldeoxycytosines and 5-propynyldeoxyuracils to increase triplex stability (15Froehler B.C. Jones R.J. Cao X.D. Terhorst T.J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993; 34: 1003-1006Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The spacer corresponds to an alkyl linker containing 4–10 methylene units. The site of attachment of the drug was also varied by the use of camptothecin derivatives substituted on either the A or the B ring of the quinoline moiety; for comparison, 10-carboxycamptothecin and 7-aminoethylcamptothecin derivatives were attached to the TFO via hexyl linkers. We investigated how the increase in length of the TFO by two nucleotides on the 3′-side would affect topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage in the proximity of the triplex site by using the previously described 16-mer, TFO16 (5Matteucci M. Lin K.-Y. Huang T. Wagner R. Sternbach D.D. Mehrotra M. Besterman J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6939-6940Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Arimondo P.B. Bailly C. Boutorine A. Sun J.S. Garestier T. Hélène C. C. R. Acad. Sci. III/Life Sciences. 1999; 322: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); an 18-mer, TFO18; and a 20-mer, TFO20 (Fig. 2). Even though the potential triplex site contains a 23-bp oligopyrimidine·oligopurine sequence, we limited our study to the 20-mer because a longer oligonucleotide would overlap the strong CPT-induced cleavage site b2 determined previously (6Arimondo P.B. Bailly C. Boutorine A. Sun J.S. Garestier T. Hélène C. C. R. Acad. Sci. III/Life Sciences. 1999; 322: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In a first set of experiments, the 324-bp restriction fragment labeled at the 3′-end of the oligopyrimidine-containing strand was incubated with the TFOs and subjected to limited DNase I cleavage (Fig. 3). As expected, the DNase I cleavage is strongly inhibited at the target oligopyrimidine·oligopurine tract, and the footprint is clearly extended with the 18- and 20-mer TFOs (lanes 12 and13) compared with the 16-mer (lane 11). In parallel experiments, the duplex DNA target was incubated with the 16-, 18-, and 20-mer TFOs prior to cleavage by topoisomerase I (Fig.3). The reactions were performed in the presence (lanes 4–6) or absence (lanes 7–9) of camptothecin. In the presence of 10-carboxycamptothecin alone (lane 3), strong topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage sites could be detected both on the 3′-side of the triplex region (at b1 and b2sites, at 4 and 7 bp from the 16-mer triplex termini, respectively) and on the 5′-side of the triplex region (site a, at 8-bp from the triple helix end). Additional sites marked c,d, e, and f were also detected. The presence of the 16-mer TFO did not greatly affect the 10CPT-stimulated cleavage (lane 4); only a decrease in cleavage at sitea was detected. As the length of the triplex increased on the 3′-end (lanes 5 and 6), cleavage at sitesb1 and b2 gradually decreased, whereas cleavages at sites a and c–f were not significantly altered. A new and weak cleavage site, designated b3, appeared in the presence of the 20-mer TFO (lane 6). A small effect was observed in the presence of the triple helix alone (lanes 7–9), but again, in the presence of the 20-mer TFO, the weak site b3 appeared, and cleavage at siteb1 was abolished. An important parameter that must be adjusted to optimize topoisomerase I-induced cleavage at the 3′-end of the triple helix is the length of the linker arm between the oligonucleotide and camptothecin. To evaluate this parameter, 10CPT was attached to the TFO16 either through a diaminobutyl (TFO16-L4–10CPT), a diaminohexyl (TFO16-L6–10CPT), or a diaminodecyl linker (TFO16-L10–10CPT) (Fig. 2). The spacer was first attached to the 3′-phosphorylated TFO upon activation by dipyridyl disulfide and triphenylphosphine in the presence of N-methylimidazole, and then the other terminal NH2 group of the linker was reacted with the N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated ester of 10-carboxycamptothecin. Fig. 4 shows the analysis of the topoisomerase I cleavage products on the radiolabeled 324-nucleotide duplex target. All of the conjugates strictly restricted DNA cleavage by topoisomerase I to the 3′-side of the duplex/triplex junction (sites b1 and b2). Cleavage at sites aand c–f completely disappeared. This is a strong indication that the enzyme has been targeted to a specific region, as expected. As the length of the spacer increases, the efficacy of cleavage at siteb1 by the TFO16–10CPT conjugate decreases; cleavage is still pronounced with the L6 conjugate (lane 5) but is much poorer with the L10 analog (lane 6). To delineate further how the presence of the triple helix influences triplex-directed topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage, we then used triplexes of different lengths in combination with different spacers. Because the conjugate containing the longest linker L10 (TFO16-L10–10CPT) is the least potent at inducing cleavage at siteb1 and, furthermore, induces some cleavage at siteb2 located at 7 bp from the 3′ triplex end, we restricted the study to the diaminobutane (L4) and diaminohexane (L6) spacers. The capacity of the 16-, 18-, and 20-mer TFO-L4/6–10CPT conjugates to induce sequence-specific topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage was compared in Fig. 5. Again DNA cleavage by topoisomerase I was restricted to the 3′-side of the duplex/triplex junction (sites b1 and b2). In the 16-mer conjugates series (lanes 4 and 5), the cleavage efficiency of topoisomerase I at site b1 decreased as the length of the linker increased (as discussed above). The reverse situation was observed in the 18-mer series (lanes 6 and7). In this case, we detected a much stronger cleavage at site b1 in the presence of the conjugate containing the L6 linker than the analog containing the L4 linker. However, the 18-mer TFO18-L6–10CPT conjugate not only recruited topoisomerase I at siteb1 but also promoted cleavage at the adjacent siteb2, whereas the 16-mer conjugates stimulated DNA cleavage only at site b1. As in the presence of the triple helix alone (Fig. 3), the 20-mer conjugates strongly reduced the access of topoisomerase I to site b1, and they stimulated cleavage only at the adjacent site b2. Of the 20-mer conjugates, the one containing the hexamethylene linker was the most efficient. The recruitment of topoisomerase I to sites b1 orb2 is markedly dependent on the length of the TFO and/or linker. In all cases, cleavage remained specific to the proximity of the 3′ triplex end; the figure clearly shows the loss of cleavage at site a and at sites c–f. All conjugates form triple helices, as revealed by footprinting experiments (data not shown). The experiments described above as well as the studies previously reported by us (6Arimondo P.B. Bailly C. Boutorine A. Sun J.S. Garestier T. Hélène C. C. R. Acad. Sci. III/Life Sciences. 1999; 322: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and others (5Matteucci M. Lin K.-Y. Huang T. Wagner R. Sternbach D.D. Mehrotra M. Besterman J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6939-6940Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were all performed with a CPT derivative substituted on the A ring. Here we extended the study to a B ring-substituted analog. According to the topoisomerase I-DNA-camptothecin ternary complex models (16Fan Y. Weinstein J.N. Kohn K.W. Shi L.M. Pommier Y. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 2216-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) and structure-activity relationships studies (18Kehrer D.F. Soepenberg O. Loos W.J. Verweij J. Sparreboom A. Anticancer Drugs. 2001; 12: 89-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), there is a space for substitutions at positions 7 and 10 on the B and A ring of the quinoline moiety of CPT, respectively, without decrease in activity. Therefore, we synthesized conjugates of the 16- and 18-mer TFO linked to 7-(2-aminoethyl)camptothecin via an hexyl linker (structure in Fig. 2). The DNA recognition and cleaving properties of these conjugates were compared with the ones of the 10-carboxycamptothecin analogs. The differences in intensity of cleavage observed for the four different combinations of TFO16/18 and 7/10CPT provide some structural information regarding the ternary DNA-topoisomerase-poison complex. Fig. 6 shows that the topoisomerase I cleavage profile of the free 7CPT differs markedly from the 10CPT one. Cleavage at site b1 was stronger than at site b2; the opposite effect was observed with 10CPT (compare lanes 3and 6). Furthermore, cleavage at site a andf was weaker with 7CPT than with 10CPT. Noteworthy, the two TFO-7CPT conjugates induced cleavage only at sites b1 andb2 on the 3′-side of the triple helix. Cleavage at all the other sites of the drug (a and c–f) was abolished, attesting that topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage had been specifically directed by triplex formation. The 16-mer conjugate of 7CPT (TFO16-L6–7CPT, lane 4) specifically enhanced cleavage at site b1 (7.6-fold) and reduced it at siteb2 as compared with free 7CPT. The reverse profile was observed with the 18-mer conjugate TFO18-L6–7CPT (lane 5), which increased cleavage at site b2 by 10-fold and decreased it at site b1. On the contrary, 10CPT conjugates (TFO16-L6–10CPT and TFO18-L6–10CPT, lanes 7 and8, respectively) stimulated cleavage preferentially at siteb1 and only the longer, the 18-mer (lane 8), cleaved at site b2 to give a profile similar to the one observed with the 16-mer 7CPT conjugate (lane 4).

The cdk5/p35 kinase may also have roles in the adult central nervous system. For example, cdk5 appears to be involved in the regulation of exocytosis from synaptic vesicles (26Fletcher A.I. Shuang R.

Furthermore, improper cdk5 activity, caused by association with a proteolytic fragment of p35, may be involved in pathogenesis of cytoskeletal abnormalities and neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (25Patrick G.N.

Neuron. 2001; 30: 135-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The cell type-specific, spatial and temporal expression of p35 is important for regulating the kinase activity of cdk5 during development. It has been shown recently in transgenic mice that expression of a heterologous gene regulated by a 1.2-kb fragment of the p35 5′ region closely resembles endogenous p35 and occurs in neuronal but not glial cells (32Tanaka T. Veeranna Ohshima T. Rajan P. Amin N. Cho A. Sreenath T. Pant H. Brady R. Kulkarni A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 550-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have analyzed the mouse p35 promoter to identify the DNA elements and transcription factors regulating p35 expression in post-mitotic neurons. We have identified a 17-bp DNA sequence that is both required and sufficient for promoter activity in neurons. Mutational analysis has shown that a GC box element within this sequence is essential for both high levels of p35 promoter activity in neurons and protein binding. Electromobility shift assays have revealed that Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 are the major transcription factors binding to the GC box in neuronal cells. In addition, our data show that there are changes in both the ratios and transcriptional activities of the Sp proteins during neuronal differentiation that could account for enhanced activity of the GC box in neurons. Therefore, these studies suggest that the GC box-binding Sp proteins regulate the levels and the neuronal specific expression of the cdk5 activator p35. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). For primer extensions radiolabeled primers were hybridized to 20 μg of RNA isolated from mouse brain (P0 and P18) or kidney (P18) at 60 °C for 90 min and then reversed-transcribed at 42 °C for 60 min with RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The primers used were 357p 5′AGTCAGGCAGGCTCCCGCGGCA3′ and 303p 5′GGAATCCAACCAGGCCGCGCA3′. For Northern analysis, 20 μg of RNA was denatured and separated by gel electrophoresis on 6% formaldehyde, 1% agarose gels and then transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization with 32P-labeled p35 or GAPDH probes was carried out using Quickhyb (Stratagene). P19 cells were grown as described previously (33Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E. Teratocarcinoma and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 19-50Google Scholar). To induce neuronal differentiation, P19 cells were aggregated and treated for 4 days with 0.3 μmall-trans-retinoic acid (RA) (Sigma) dissolved in Me2SO and then plated onto tissue culture plates and grown in the absence of RA until harvesting (33Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E. Teratocarcinoma and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 19-50Google Scholar). Control cells were treated similarly, but the RA was omitted. P19 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). 1 × 104 4-day control Me2SO-exposed P19 cells or 2 × 105 4-day RA-treated P19 cells were plated into 24-well tissue culture plates, and 2 days after plating cells were co-transfected with 500 ng of luciferase reporter construct and 25 ng of the Renilla reporter construct pRL-tk. Primary cortical neurons were prepared from E18 rat cortices and plated onto laminin and poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips. Cortical neurons were transiently transfected with 1 μg of luciferase reporter construct and 50 ng of pRL-tk using calcium phosphate 4 days after plating. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and luciferase andRenilla assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega). For all promoter assays the activity of the luciferase construct was normalized to the Renilla activity of the pRL-tk construct. All transfections were done in triplicate on multiple occasions. Primary cortical neurons plated onto laminin and poly-d-lysine coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed 3 times with PBS, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20 in 1× PBS). Cells were then washed once with PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-TuJ1 antibody (Covance Research Products). Cells were washed 3 times with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Texas Red-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Following this incubation cells were washed 3 times with PBS, Hoechst-stained, washed with PBS again, and then mounted in Prolong antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Nuclear extracts for Western blots and electromobility shift assays were prepared from P19 or primary cortical cells as described previously (34Lewis S.E. Konradi C. Methods. 1996; 10: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, proteins were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were probed with anti-Sp1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Sp3, and anti-Sp4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences). For electromobility shift assays, binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 20 min and contained 4 pmol of 32P-radiolabeled annealed oligonucleotide and 3 μg of nuclear extract in a binding buffer containing 12.5 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm ZnSO4, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 3 μg of salmon sperm DNA. Competitor oligonucleotides were incubated with the nuclear extract at room temperature for 20 min before addition of the radiolabeled probe. For supershift experiments, 2 μg of anti-Sp1 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Sp3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), or anti-Sp4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were incubated with the nuclear extract at room temperature for 20 min before addition of the radiolabeled probe. To separate free probe from protein-DNA complexes, the reactions were electrophoresed at 200 V on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE and 1% glycerol. The oligonucleotides used in the EMSA were gel-purified and annealed. The sequences of the top strand oligonucleotides used for EMSA are as follows: BS.1, 5′CACCGGTGGCGGGGCGGGGGCGGAGCCGGCGGGCTC3′; BS.2, 5′CCAGGCGGGCCGGGCGGGGGCGGAGCCGCGGCGTCT3′; 17-mer, 5′GCGGGGCGGGGGCGGAGCCGGCG3′; m1, 5′GCGTTTCGGGGGCGGAGCCGGCG3′; m2, 5′GCGGGGATTGGGCGGAGCCGGCG3′; m3, 5′GCGGGGCGGTTTCGGAGCCGGCG3′; m4, 5′GCGGGGCGGGGGATTAGCCGGCG3′; m5, 5′GCGGGGCGGGGGCGGCTACGGCG3′; Sp1, 5′ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC3′; Ap2, 5′CTTCTGCCCTGCGGGGACACGG3′; Egr, 5′CCCGGCGCGGGGGCGATTTCG3′; and NRF-1, 5′GTAGACTGCGCATGCGCATATGGA3′. The indicated regions of the p35 promoter DNA were amplified by PCR and cloned upstream of either GFP in pEGFP1 or luciferase in pGL2. Mutations of the p35 promoter were all generated by PCR methods and verified by sequencing. The 3 × 17-mer-TATA reporter construct was generated by cloning 3 copies of the 17-bp element upstream of the TATA box in E1B-luc. G5-luc, which contains 5 copies of the Gal4-binding site upstream of the luciferase reporter gene, has been described previously (35Haviv I. Vaizel D. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression plasmids containing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147) fused to the VP16 activation domain, AP2 activation domain, Sp1 (amino acids 83–778), Sp3 (amino acids 1–527), and Sp4 (amino acids 98–621) have been described previously (36Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 37Williams T. Tjian R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). As a first step to investigate the regulation of p35 mRNA expression, the position of the mouse p35 promoter was identified by mapping the transcription start site. Like many neuronal genes, the DNA upstream of the mouse p35 gene is GC-rich and lacks a consensus TATA box. Primer extension analysis with multiple primers located at positions 5′ of the ATG produced several bands specifically with RNA isolated from brain, suggesting that there were several transcription start sites located between 416 and 406 bases upstream of the ATG (Fig.1A and data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1A, reactions using both the 303p and the 357p primers revealed a predominant start site 411 bp upstream of the ATG (Fig. 1, A and B). It is interesting to note that primer extension analysis with the primer 303p, which lies within a region previously identified as an intron (40Ohshima T. Kozak C.A. Nagle J.W. Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Kulkarni A.B. Genomics. 1996; 35: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), indicates the presence of unspliced p35 mRNA in the brain (Fig. 1A). Intriguingly, the major start site that we have identified lies within a 26-bp region of the mouse p35 promoter that is 100% conserved with sequences 5′ of the human p35 gene. In transgenic mice a 1.2-kb fragment of the p35 promoter (corresponding to −895 to +325 relative to our start site mapping) was found to drive expression in neuronal but not glial cells, similar to endogenous p35 (32Tanaka T. Veeranna Ohshima T. Rajan P. Amin N. Cho A. Sreenath T. Pant H. Brady R. Kulkarni A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 550-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the expression of a reporter construct containing 1.17 kb of the p35 promoter (−1116 to +54) fused to GFP (Fig. 2A) following transfection into primary cortical cells isolated from E18 rat embryos. The p35-GFP reporter construct was expressed in the primary cortical cells, and the cells expressing GFP were indeed neurons as shown by immunostaining with the neuronal cell marker TuJ1 (Fig. 2B). Thus, in a cell culture system the p35 promoter appears to be sufficient for expression in primary cortical neurons. To address how transcriptional mechanisms were regulating the neuronal specific expression of p35 the P19 cell line was utilized. P19 cells are a mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line that can be induced to differentiate into neuronal P19 cells by aggregation and treatment with retinoic acid (41Bain G. Ray W.J. Yao M. Gottlieb D.I. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). P19 cells were chosen as a model system because the differentiated cells closely resemble neurons that are present in the mammalian central nervous system, and like normal neurons, P19 neurons are post-mitotic (41Bain G. Ray W.J. Yao M. Gottlieb D.I. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This is an important characteristic as p35 is only expressed in post-mitotic neurons of the central nervous system (11Tomizawa K. Matsui H. Matsushita M. Lew J. Tokuda M. Itano T. Konishi R. Wang J.H. Hatase O. Neuroscience. 1996; 74: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Delalle I. Bhide P.G. Caviness V.S. Tsai L.H. J. Neurocytol. 1997; 26: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine whether P19 cells could be used to analyze regulation of p35 expression during neuronal differentiation, Northern blot analysis was performed using RNA isolated from undifferentiated or neuronal P19 cells. Undifferentiated P19 cells or P19 cells that had been treated with RA for 2 days, a stage in the P19 differentiation process when the cells do not yet display a neuronal phenotype, showed very low levels of p35 mRNA (Fig. 3A, 2nd and3rd lanes). However, p35 mRNA was induced in P19 neurons (Fig. 3A, 4th lane). Thus, P19 cells appeared to be a good cell line in which to study the mechanisms regulating the neuronal specific expression of p35 mRNA. To determine whether transcriptional mechanisms were important for regulating expression of p35 mRNA during neuronal differentiation in P19 cells, a reporter construct containing 1.17 kb of the p35 promoter (−1116 to +54) fused to the luciferase gene was generated (p35–1116). The p35–1116 reporter was transiently transfected into P19 cells that were differentiated into neuronal cells with RA or control undifferentiated cells treated with Me2SO, and the activity of the promoter was determined by examining the relative luciferase activity. The p35–1116 luciferase reporter was ≈25-fold more active in the neuronal P19 cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the activity of the p35 promoter was not induced in P19 cells that were treated with RA for just 24 h, a time that was sufficient to activate a reporter construct dependent on a retinoic acid receptor-response element (data not shown). Thus, the activity of the p35 promoter is induced once the P19 cells have differentiated into post-mitotic neurons, which mimics the expression of endogenous p35 mRNA. This result strongly suggests that transcriptional mechanisms are important for the neuronal specific expression of p35 mRNA and provides an assay to identify the key DNA elements necessary. To identify the regions of the promoter that contribute to the neuronal specific expression of p35, reporter constructs containing 5′-truncations of the p35 promoter fused to luciferase were generated. The activity of these reporter constructs was determined following transient transfection into control and neuronal P19 cells. Deletion of the p35 promoter from −1116 to −889 reduced the promoter activity about 2-fold in neurons, and further deletions of the promoter to −265 continued to show similar levels of activity (Fig. 3B). However, deletion of the promoter to −65 reduced promoter activity about 30-fold compared with the activity of the full-length reporter construct (Fig. 3B), suggesting that there are DNA elements between −265 and −65 important for high levels of p35 promoter activity in neurons. It is noteworthy that none of the deletion mutations increased p35 promoter activity in the undifferentiated control P19 cells. This suggests that positive regulatory elements within the p35 promoter, rather than a discreet repressive element, are responsible for cell type specificity. To localize further the DNA elements between −265 and −65 responsible for high levels of expression in neurons, reporter constructs containing 5′-truncations of the promoter between −265 and −35 were generated and assayed. Reporter constructs containing deletions of the promoter up to −155 showed similar activity to the −265 construct; however, deletion up to −95 reduced promoter activity 10-fold (Fig.3C). Reporter constructs containing deletions up to −35 did not reduce promoter activity any further. Reporter constructs containing internal deletions of the p35 promoter were also generated to confirm the importance of the promoter region identified through the 5′-deletion constructs. An internal deletion between −35 and −76 increased promoter activity in both control and neuronal cells about 2-fold (Fig. 3D); however, an internal deletion from −35 to −265 reduced promoter activity more than 5-fold (Fig. 3D). Thus, these data show that a small region of the p35 promoter is sufficient for high levels of activity in neuronal P19 cells and suggests that the region from −155 to −95 is required for promoter activity. To map further the DNA elements required for p35 promoter activity, 6-bp mutations spanning −155 to −45 were generated, and their activity was determined. None of the 6-bp mutations reduced promoter activity to the level observed in the −95 deletion (data not shown), suggesting that several elements were important for promoter activity. The mutations that reduced promoter activity the most were −133/−128 and −124/−119 (Fig.4A), which showed approximately a 2-fold reduction in promoter activity (data not shown). Examination of the promoter sequence revealed that these mutations were both within a 17-bp GC-rich element that is exactly repeated 50 bp downstream (Fig. 4A). We therefore considered the possibility that the two elements were functionally redundant and that in order to see a significant reduction in promoter activity both elements would need to be mutated. Hence, reporter constructs containing 11-bp mutations of the 17-bp elements individually and in combination were generated, and their activity was determined. Mutation of the 5′ 17-bp element alone reduced promoter activity about 2-fold (Fig. 4B, m17.1) similar to the reduction seen with the 6-bp mutations 133/−128 and −124/−119 (data not shown). Although mutation of the 3′ 17-bp element alone reduced promoter activity only slightly (Fig. 4B, m17.2), a reporter construct containing mutations within both 17-bp elements reduced promoter activity about 5-fold (Fig. 4B, m17.1 m17.2). Thus, two identical 17-bp elements within the p35 promoter appear to be required for high levels of activity in the neuronal P19 cells. Interestingly, the 3′ 17-bp element lies within a region that is highly conserved between mouse and human p35 promoters. By having determined that the 17-bp elements were necessary for high levels of expression in the P19 neurons, we wished to determine whether this element contributed directly to cell type specificity. Hence, the activity of reporter constructs containing either a consensus TATA alone or three copies of the 17-bp element cloned upstream of a consensus TATA were examined. The TATA alone showed very low levels of promoter activity in both the control cells and P19 neurons; however, the reporter construct containing the 17-bp elements showed increased promoter activity and was ∼80-fold more active in P19 neurons (Fig.4C). Thus, the 17-bp element appears to be sufficient for cell type-specific expression. The 17-bp element was identified as being required for high levels of neuronal specific p35 promoter activity using the P19 cells as a model system; hence, we verified these findings in primary cortical neurons. Deletion of the p35 promoter from −155 to −65 almost eliminated activity of the promoter (Fig. 4D) indicating that this region is essential for high levels of activity, consistent with the results obtained in the P19-derived neurons. Furthermore, mutations within either of the 17-bp elements reduced promoter activity ∼3-fold compared with the wild type −155 construct, and a reporter construct containing mutations within both 17-bp elements reduced promoter activity 30-fold, almost abolishing promoter activity (Fig. 4D). Thus, the 17-bp elements appear to be required for p35 promoter activity in primary cortical neurons. In addition, the reporter construct containing three copies of the 17-bp element upstream of a consensus TATA was 20 times more active in the primary cortical neurons compared with the TATA alone (Fig.4E). Thus, these data show that the 17-bp element is necessary and sufficient for promoter activity in primary cortical neurons. The 17-bp GC-rich element contains putative binding sites for the Egr (NGFI-A) family of transcription factors and also for GC box-binding factors (Fig. 5A). To determine the importance"

These reports indicated that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are localized in the low-density microsome fraction and that IRS-3 is located mainly to the plasma membranes (6Anai M. Ono H. Funaki M. Fukushima Y.

Recently, Fantin et al. reported that IRS-4 was concentrated at the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane (7Fantin V.R. Sparling J.D. Slot J.W. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. Lavan B.E. J. Biol.

In this study, we studied IRS-3 localization using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-IRS-3 chimera proteins. We found that IRS-3 was located to the nucleus, and we went on to define the regions of IRS-3 critical for nuclear localization. In addition, we investigated the function of IRS-3 in the nucleus and found that IRS-3 possesses transcription-regulating activity. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was purchased from Nissui (Tokyo). Calf serum and fetal bovine serum were obtained from JRH Bioscience (Tokyo). Penicillin and streptomycin were obtained from Ban'yu Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo). Leupeptin and pepstatin were generous gifts from Dr. Takaaki Aoyagi (Institute of Microbial Chemistry, Tokyo). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20 was from ICN (Irvine, CA,), and anti-Gal4 DNA binding domain antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-IRS-3 antibody was prepared by immunizing rabbits with synthetic peptides as reported previously (6Anai M. Ono H. Funaki M. Fukushima Y. Inukai K. Ogihara T. Sakoda H. Onishi Y.

All dishes, plates, and flasks were obtained from IWAKI (Tokyo). Other chemicals were of the reagent grade available commercially. Rat IRS-3 cDNA was prepared as described previously (6Anai M. Ono H.

To construct the pGFP-IRS-3 vector, an EcoRI-EcoRI fragment encoding IRS-3 was inserted into an EcoRI-digested pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The pIRS-3-GFP vector was prepared as follows. A BamHI-NotI fragment encoding IRS-3 was inserted into a BamHI-NotI-cut pBluescriptKS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). An IRS-3 fragment was amplified by PCR from this pBluescript/IRS-3 vector. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SalI, and then cloned into an EcoRI-SalI-cut pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) vector. The primers used for this experiment were 5′-TTTCACACAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′ and 5′-GAAAGGTCGACAACTTGATGCTGGCA-3′. The latter primer was used to remove the TAG (termination) site. The mammalian expression vector pCMV was constructed from pEGFP-N1 by deletingBamHI-NotI fragment encoding GFP. The pIRS-3 was constructed by inserting the aforementionedEcoRI-EcoRI fragment encoding IRS-3 at anEcoRI site of pCMV vector. The vectors of pGFP-IRS-3 deletion mutants, D1, D3, D4, D5, and D6 were constructed by ligating each fragment in pEGFP vector using appropriate restriction enzymes. Before D4 and D6 constructs were made, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Kunkel method (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 15.74-15.79Google Scholar) to yield PmaCI andScaI sites in the sequence of IRS-3. We used the following primers in this procedure, 5′-CGGCTTCCGCCACGTGCTCAGGGCCC-3′ and 5′-GGACAAGCGCAGTACTGGTGGTGGCG-3′. After preparing these constructs, we confirmed that the nucleic sequences of IRS-3 were not changed artificially. To generate the D2 vector, a D2 fragment was amplified by PCR from pBluescript/IRS-3 vector, digested with EcoRI andXhoI, and inserted into anEcoRI-XhoI-digested pEGFP-C1 vector. The primers 5′-ACCGCTCGAGGTTTCAGCCCCCAAGA-3′ and 5′-CGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′ were used for this experiment. The rat IRS-1 cDNA (9Ueno H. Kondo E. Yamamoto-Honda R. Tobe K. Nakamoto T. Sasaki K.

The human IRS-2 and IRS-4 cDNAs were prepared as described elsewhere (10Anai M. Funaki M. Ogiwara T. Terasaki J. Inukai K. Katagiri H. Fukushima Y. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The pGFP-IRS-2 vector was constructed by ligating anEcoRI-BamHI fragment in anEcoRI-BamHI-cut pEGFP-C1 vector. The pGFP-IRS-4 vector was constructed by ligating an EcoRI-EcoRI fragment in an EcoRI-cut pEGFP-C1 vector. To construct the pBIND-IRS-1C vector, an IRS-1C fragment was amplified by PCR, digested with EcoRV and KpnI, and inserted into anEcoRV-KpnI-digested pBIND vector (Promega) to express fusion protein with Gal4 DNA binding domain. The primers 5′-TGCGGATATCGAGCGATGAGTTTCGCCC-3′ and 5′-CAGGGTACCTATTGACGGTCCTCTGGTTG-3′ were used for this experiment. An IRS-3N or IRS-3C fragment was amplified by PCR from pBluescript/IRS-3 vector, digested with EcoRV or EcoRV andXbaI and inserted into a pBIND vector to yield the pBIND-IRS-3N or pBIND-IRS-3C vectors. We used the following primers in this procedure: 5′TGGATATCGATGAAGCCTGCAGGTAC-3′ and 5′-ACTGATATCCAGTCTCTTCATGGCAG-3′ for IRS-3N and 5′-AAGATATCGGGGAGCAGTGCAGCC-3′ and 5′-CGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′ for IRS-3C. The pBIND-IRS-2C, pBIND-IRS-3, and pBIND-IRS-4C vectors were constructed by ligating each fragment into pBIND vector in frame using appropriate restriction enzymes. COS-7 cells were generously provided by Dr. Hiroshi Kataoka (Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified CO2-controlled atmosphere in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, 0.1% NaHCO3, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.5 μg/ml amphotericin B (Sankyo, Tokyo). The expression vectors were transfected into COS-7 cells using DEAE-dextran procedure (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.41-16.45Google Scholar). Cells were grown to be subconfluent on 60-mm dishes. The medium was then changed to 4 ml of transfection buffer (DMEM containing 10 μg of DNA, 0.3 mg/ml DEAE-dextran, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4). After 4-h incubation, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were treated for 2 min with 4 ml of glycerol buffer (DMEM supplemented with 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Subsequently, the cells were washed three times with Hanks' buffered salt saline solution (NISSUI) and cultured in 4 ml of growing medium for an additional 40 h. Fluorescence microscopic analysis was then performed using an Axiovert 100 phase-contrast microscope (Zeiss, Germany). HEK 293 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Kunio Shiota (Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified CO2-controlled atmosphere in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% NaHCO3, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.5 μg/ml amphotericin B. The expression vectors were transfected into HEK 293 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (12Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar). 220 μl of DNA solution (2 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega), pG5-luc (Promega), and each pBIND vector), 5 μl of 70 mmNa2HPO4, 250 μl of 2× Hebs (42 mm HEPES, 290 mm NaCl, pH 7.1), and 25 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2 were mixed in order. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C and transferred into the medium above the cell monolayer. After cells were incubated for additional 24 h, the medium was replaced. Adipocytes from the epididymal fat pads of Wistar strain rats were prepared according to a previously published method (13Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells transfected with the pIRS-3 vector or rat adipocytes were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were washed with PBS again and permeabilized with methanol for 2 min. Cells were first washed with PBS and then with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS before incubating for 1 h with anti-rat IRS-3 antibody or anti-rat IRS-3 antibody that had been neutralized with the synthetic peptides used for raising this antibody. Cells were washed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and further incubated with fluorescent isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA) for 30 min. Finally, cells were washed with PBS and mounted in 10% PBS-2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma) in glycerol. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed. Subcellular fractionation of COS-7 cells was performed by modified methods of Jin et al.(14Jin C.S.-L. Bushnik T. Lan L. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out at 0 °C. COS-7 cells on 60-mm dish were transfected with IRS-3 cDNA as described above and were scraped in 200 μl of detergent-free (DF) harvesting buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 500 μmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml PMSF, 100 kallikrein-inactivating unit/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate). The lysates were homogenized by 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with a loose pestle (Wheaton, NJ). The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was obtained as a cytosolic fraction. After washing twice with DF harvesting buffer, the initial pellet was suspended in 200 μl of Triton lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in DF harvesting buffer), incubated for 15 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was obtained as a membrane fraction. Finally, after washing twice with Triton lysis buffer, the pellet was suspended in 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (1% deoxycholic acid sodium salt, 0.1% SDS in Triton lysis buffer), incubated for 15 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was obtained as a nucleus fraction. In some experiments, the pellet was suspended in Triton lysis buffer with the exception that the concentration of Triton X-100 is 1% instead of 0.1% and homogenized vigorously to break up the nucleus. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was recovered as a nucleus fraction. The activity of alkaline phosphatase, a plasma membrane enzyme marker, was measured in each fraction prepared without SDS and EDTA according to the method reported by Koyama et al. (15Koyama H. Ono T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1976; 88: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The contents of DNA in each fraction were measured as a nuclear marker by the modified methods of Sambrook et al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.16-9.17Google Scholar). 100 μl of concentrated 3× Laemmli sample buffer solution (9% SDS, 15% glycerol, 30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 6% 2-mercaptoethanol) was then added to 200 μl of each fraction, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at 100 °C. These samples were then stored at −80 °C until electrophoresis. Isolated nuclei were prepared from rat adipose tissues basically according to the methods of Lynch et al. (17Lynch W.E. Brown R.F. Umeda T. Langreth S.G. Lieberman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3911-3916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 0 °C. Rat adipose tissue (∼ 4 g) were rinsed in 0.3 m sucrose and minced with dissecting scissors in 15 volumes of 0.3 msucrose, 4 mm CaCl2. The suspension was then homogenized by 80 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with a loose pestle. The homogenate was passed through 250-μm piece of nylon mesh, and the filtrate was centrifuged at 750 × g for 4 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 7 ml of 2m sucrose, 1 mm CaCl2. The suspension was then layered over 6 ml of 2.2 m sucrose, and the nuclei were sedimented by centrifugation for 30 min at 40,000 × g. Finally, the nuclei were suspended in 80 μl of radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer, and 40 μl of concentrated 3× Laemmli sample buffer solution was added. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 100 °C, and the immunoblotting analysis of these samples was performed as described above. In some experiments, the nuclei were suspended in 1% Triton lysis buffer, and the nuclear extracts were prepared as described above followed by measuring of the alkaline phosphatase activity. The same volume of the samples was subjected to 9% SDS-PAGE and transferred to membranes based on standard electroblotting procedures as described previously (18Ariga M. Nedachi T. Akahori M. Sakamoto H. Ito Y. Hakuno F. Takahashi S.-I. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The membrane was then incubated for at least 1.5 h at room temperature in the blocking buffer containing anti-IRS-3 antibody (1:3000) or a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 (1:3000). Specific proteins were detected using an ECL kit according to the directions by the manufacturer (DuPont). The results were quantified using NIH image computer program (version 1.61). After cell fractionation, 60 μl of each fraction was diluted to 1 ml with DF harvesting buffer. This solution was incubated with anti-IRS-3 antibody (10 μl) for 12 h at 4 °C, 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50% (v/v), Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was then added, and incubation was continued for 2 h. Immunoprecipitation was then performed followed by immunoblotting as described previously (18Ariga M. Nedachi T. Akahori M. Sakamoto H. Ito Y. Hakuno F. Takahashi S.-I. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of pG5-luc, pSV-β-galactosidase, and each pBIND fusion construct as described above. In the case of a positive control experiment, we transfected cells with 2 μg of pACT-MyoD, which contains the VP16 activation domain, and pBIND-Id control vector of CheckMateTMmammalian two-hybrid system (Promega) instead of pBIND vector. At 24 h after transfection, cells were washed three times with PBS and scraped in 400 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The cells were subjected to a single freeze-thaw. After vortexing the cells, the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was assayed directly or stored at −70 °C. The β-galactosidase activity was assayed using the β-galactosidase assay system with reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity in 10 μl of the cell extract was measured by an automated luminometer (Wallac-Berthold, Tokyo). Luciferase activity was normalized by β-galactosidase activity, and the data thus normalized by β-galactosidase activity are presented. Each pBIND construct was transfected into three separate dishes, and the results were confirmed in three independent experiments. To determine the subcellular localization of IRS-3, we expressed IRS-3 in a COS-7 cells as a fusion protein with a GFP and analyzed the subcellular location of the chimera by fluorescence microscopy. When we introduced the pEGFP-C1 vector encoding GFP into COS-7 cells, the fluorescence was dispersed in the cytosol (Fig.1, top panels). As shown in Fig. 1, middle panels, IRS-3 labeled with GFP at its N-terminal end (GFP-IRS-3) was localized not only to the plasma membranes but also in the nucleus. We identified this compartment as the nuclei, because the compartment is exclusively stained by 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI). A chimera protein labeled with GFP at the IRS-3 C-terminal end (IRS-3-GFP), showed the same distribution pattern as that seen using IRS-3 labeled at its N-terminal end (Fig. 1, bottom panels). We then sought to determine whether non-fused wild-type IRS-3 is localized in the nucleus of COS-7 cells that do not express IRS-3. We transiently transfected cells with pIRS-3 and immunostained with anti-IRS-3 antibody (Fig. 2 A). The IRS-3 signal was detected in the nucleus. In the presence of the peptide used to raise the anti-IRS-3 antibody, these signals were completely obliterated. To further confirm the presence of IRS-3 in the nucleus, COS-7 cells expressing IRS-3 were homogenized and fractionated into the cytosol, membrane, and nuclear fractions. Contamination of the cytosol or nuclear fractions by membrane proteins was minimal, because we detected only 2.6 or 1.5% alkaline phosphatase activity in the cytosol and nuclear fractions, respectively, that was found in the membrane fraction. In addition, we measured the DNA contents of each fraction and lysates of the cytosol, membrane, and nuclear fractions containing 0.00, 0.00, and 0.41 μg of DNA, respectively. Each fraction was subjected to immunoblotting with anti-IRS-3 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 B, IRS-3 was clearly detected in all of three fractions. Based on the density of signals, the relative ratios of IRS-3 in the cytosolic, membrane, and nuclear fractions were calculated as 5:12:5. Because IRS-3 is known to be tyrosine-phosphorylated, aliquots of each fraction were also immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-3 antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2 B). We found that IRS-3 in membrane and nuclear fractions was tyrosine-phosphorylated, although IRS-3 in cytosolic fraction was not phosphorylated. To analyze whether the factors in serum including insulin and insulin-like growth factors induce nuclear import and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-3, we transfected cells with pIRS-3 under serum-free conditions. We found that IRS-3 was localized into the nucleus and phosphorylated even under serum-free conditions (data not shown). Thus, the stimuli leading to nuclear import of IRS-3 and its tyrosine phosphorylation remain to be determined. We then investigated the subcellular localization of endogenous IRS-3 by immunostaining of rat adipocytes, a tissue known to express IRS-3 in the rat (19Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11439-11443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, endogenous IRS-3 was detected in the nucleus of isolated rat adipocytes. Immunoneutralized serum (Fig. 3 A) or non-immune serum (data not shown) failed to yield a signal in the nucleus, although modest signals on the plasma membranes were observed. In addition, we found IRS-3 in the nuclear fractions after cell fractionation of adipocytes (Fig. 3 B). In this case, alkaline phosphatase activity was not detected in the nuclear extracts. These experiments indicate that endogenous IRS-3 is localized to the nucleus, and that our results are not an artifact of overexpression. To identify the region of IRS-3 that directs nuclear localization, we prepared deletion mutants and fragments of IRS-3 fused with GFP and then performed subcellular localization of each protein. First of all, signals of GFP fused with N-terminal or C-terminal regions including PTB domain were observed in the nuclei (Fig.4, D1 and D2). In addition, we found that a portion of IRS-3 that includes the PTB domain fused with GFP localized predominately to the nuclei (Fig. 4, D3). We then introduced a mutant of the PTB domain deleting amino acids 194–213. The localization of this mutant exclusively took place in the cytosol (Fig.4, D4), whereas the 192–223 fragment fused with GFP accumulated in the nuclei (Fig. 4, D5). Lastly, the mutant with a deletion of amino acids 194–213 from intact IRS-3 was observed only in cytosol (Fig. 4, D6). Taken together, these data suggest that region 192–223 functions as a nuclear localization signal. In Fig. 5 A, we aligned the amino acid sequences of each IRS. The putative nuclear localization signals in PTB domain have a unique amino acid sequence from amino acids 192 to 223, suggesting that these sequences may be important for IRS-3 localization. This region contains scattered basic amino acids clusters, suggesting that these regions may provide nuclear localization signals (20Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 193-227PubMed Google Scholar). We then asked whether IRS-1, IRS-2, or IRS-4 could exhibit nuclear localization. The N-terminal GFP fusion protein of each IRS was expressed in COS-7 cells, and the subcellular localization of each chimeric protein was tested. As shown in Fig.5 B, GFP-IRS-1, GFP-IRS-2, and GFP-IRS-4 were predominantly localized in the cytosol and plasma membranes. GFP-IRS-1 and GFP-IRS-2 gave discrete spotty images, suggesting that these proteins are concentrated to a specific cell compartment, but they did not localize to the nucleus. These results demonstrate that intracellular distribution of IRS-3 is unique among the known IRSs. Finally, to investigate the function of IRS-3 in the nucleus, we measured transcriptional activity of IRS-3 by Gal4 chimeric transcriptional regulator assay using HEK 293 cells (Fig.6). To analyze the ability of IRS-3 as a potential transcriptional activator, we generated the construct Gal4-full-length IRS-3, N-terminal region of IRS-3 (amino acid residues 1–270), or C-terminal region of IRS-3 (amino acids 271–494) by fusing IRS-3 N-terminally to the Gal4-DNA binding domain. Each construct was transiently transfected into HEK 293 cells together with the reporter construct (Fig. 6 A). The Gal4-C-terminal region of IRS-3 potently stimulated the transcription of the reporter gene, although Gal4-full-length IRS-3 or N-terminal region of IRS-3 did not affect transcriptional activity. We concluded that the C-terminal region of IRS-3 has transcription activity that can be unmasked by the removal of the N-terminal region. Similar results were reported in the case of Smad1 (21Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Carcamo J. Harland R.M. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 381: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). We then compared the transcriptional activity of the C-terminal region of each IRS. As shown in Fig. 6 B, only the C-terminal region of IRS-3 worked as a transcriptional activator. The expression of each construct was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-Gal4 antibody as well as anti-IRS-antibodies (data not shown). As discussed above, the C-terminal domains of each IRS exhibit low homology, suggesting that among the proteins of the IRS family the C-terminal region of IRS-3 possessed transcription-regulating activity. IRS-1 and IRS-2 have important roles in signal transduction for hormones or cytokines including insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I. The physiological relevance of IRS-3 is less clear. Zhouet al. (22Zhou L. Chen H., Xu, P. Cong L.-N. Sciacchitano S., Li, Y. Graham D. Jacobs A.R. Taylor S.I. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 505-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that IRS-3 is capable of mediating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent metabolic actions of insulin in adipose tissues. In addition, Anai et al. (6Anai M. Ono H. Funaki M. Fukushima Y. Inukai K. Ogihara T. Sakoda H. Onishi Y. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29686-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) demonstrated that IRS-3 has a different role from IRS-1 and IRS-2 in insulin signaling in rat adipocytes. Razzini et al. (23Razzini G. Ingrosso A. Brancaccio A. Sciacchitano S. Esposito D.L. Falasca M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 823-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) recently showed that the pleckstrin homology domains of IRS-1, IRS-2, and IRS-3 bound with different specificities to the 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, and the localization of pleckstrin homology domains of IRS-1 and IRS-2 was different from IRS-3. Taken together, these results imply that IRS-3 has a different physiological function than other IRS proteins. IRS-3 does not appear essential for normal growth, glucose homeostasis, and glucose transport, because irs-3null mutant mice do not demonstrate a phenotype consistent with such abnormalities (24Liu S.C. Wang Q. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18093-18099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, IRS-3 is highly expressed at 7 days of mouse embryonic life (25Sciacchitano S. Taylor S.I. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4931-4940Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that IRS-3 has a unique physiological role in the nuclei such as regulation of transcription. Our studies demonstrate three novel findings. IRS-3 is localized to nuclei, and unique amino acid sequences in IRS-3 appear to function as nuclear localization signals. In addition, the C-terminal domain of IRS-3 has transcriptional activity as demonstrated when it was fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. These results suggest that intracellular localization of IRS-3 is different from that of other IRS proteins, and that IRS-3 possesses a novel nuclear function in addition to its physiological role as one of the insulin receptor kinase substrates.

https://openalex.org/W2155193072,"Waglerin-1 (Wtx-1) is a 22-amino acid peptide that is a competitive antagonist of the muscle nicotinic receptor (nAChR). We find that Wtx-1 binds 2100-fold more tightly to the α-ε than to the α-δ binding site interface of the mouse nAChR. Moreover, Wtx-1 binds 100-fold more tightly to the α-ε interface from mouse nAChR than that from rat or human sources. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues differing in the extracellular domains of rat and mouse ε subunits indicates that residues 59 and 115 mediate the species difference in Wtx-1 affinity. Mutation of residues 59 (Asp in mouse, Glu in rat ε) and 115 (Tyr in mouse, Ser in rat ε) converts Wtx-1 affinity for the α-ε interface of one species to that of the other species. Studies of different mutations at position 59 indicate both steric and electrostatic contributions to Wtx-1 affinity, whereas at position 115, both aromatic and polar groups contribute to affinity. The human nAChR also has lower affinity for Wtx-1 than mouse nAChR, but unlike rat nAChR, residues in both α and ε subunits mediate the affinity difference. In human nAChR, polar residues (Ser-187 and Thr-189) confer low affinity, whereas in mouse nAChR aromatic residues (Trp-187 and Phe-189) confer high affinity. The overall results show that non-conserved residues at the nAChR binding site, although not crucial for activation by ACh, govern the potency of neuromuscular toxins. Waglerin-1 (Wtx-1) is a 22-amino acid peptide that is a competitive antagonist of the muscle nicotinic receptor (nAChR). We find that Wtx-1 binds 2100-fold more tightly to the α-ε than to the α-δ binding site interface of the mouse nAChR. Moreover, Wtx-1 binds 100-fold more tightly to the α-ε interface from mouse nAChR than that from rat or human sources. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues differing in the extracellular domains of rat and mouse ε subunits indicates that residues 59 and 115 mediate the species difference in Wtx-1 affinity.

Each of the five subunits contains between 445 and 497 amino acids with residues 1 through ∼210 forming the extracellular ligand binding domain. Each receptor subunit has up to three N-linked glycosylation sites and four transmembrane spans, giving the pentamer a molecular mass of nearly 300 kDa with 20 membrane spans. The binding sites for agonists and competitive antagonists are found at interfaces of the α-δ and α-ε (or α-γ) subunits of the receptor.

Tamiya N. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 165-222Google Scholar). These small proteins of 57–80 amino acids are commonly called “3-fingered” snake toxins for their characteristic three loop topology, with each of the three fingers extending from a core “knuckle” region consisting of four conserved disulfide bonds. Three-fingered toxins such as α-bungarotoxin have been used to probe the nAChR for over 30 years (8Changeux J.P. Kasai M. Lee C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Viperidae family of snakes does not make 3-fingered toxins and were generally believed not to confer toxicity by targeting nicotinic receptors. Wagler's pit viper, Tropidolaemus wagleri, is unique among Viperids for morphological reasons as well as for the unique components of its venom. Four related peptides, whose sequence differences are boldfaced, have been isolated from the venom of this species, all of which cause paralysis by neuromuscular blockade (9Aiken S.P. Sellin L.C.

Lee and colleagues who nearly forty years ago showed that α-bungarotoxin irreversibly blocks neuromuscular transmission (16Chang C.C. Lee C.Y. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. 1963; 144: 241-257PubMed Google Scholar). Their more recent studies indicate a remarkable difference in waglerin toxicity between mice and rats (17Lin W.W. Smith L.A. Lee C.Y. Toxicon. 1995; 33: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mice were paralyzed by a 0.5 μg/g intravenous injection in as little as 5 min; rats were completely resistant to 20 times the mouse lethal dose. A similar species selectivity was noted in isolated phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparations, with over a 40-fold difference in sensitivity (17Lin W.W. Smith L.A. Lee C.Y. Toxicon. 1995; 33: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Waglerin-1 also has no effect when applied to a chicken biventer cervicis muscle-nerve preparation (18Tan N.H. Tan C.S. Toxicon. 1989; 27: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For obvious reasons, similar toxicity data are not available for human. Here we show that sequence differences between mouse, rat, and human nAChRs account for the specificity of Wtx-1. The identified residues are located in regions of the three-dimensional structure known to contribute to the nAChR binding site. Because the Wtx-1 binding profile for each species can be reconstructed by mutating only these key residues, the species selectivity is not likely due to global structural changes. Rather, the key residues likely interact directly with Wtx-1 or affect its bound orientation. The overall results show how non-conserved residues at the nAChR binding site interface govern species specificity of competitive antagonists. The crude peptides, synthesized by the American Peptide Company (San Jose, CA) or Synpep (Dublin, CA) were dissolved to 0.8 mg/ml in 30 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.2–8.5, sterile-filtered and left overnight at room temperature to form the single intramolecular disulfide. After disulfide bond cyclization, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was added to the solution to stop cyclization and prevent the formation of intermolecular disulfides. A 2-ml injection of the peptide solution was loaded onto a 5-ml high performance liquid chromatography sample loop and purified on a 10- × 250-mm semi-preparative C18 column (Vydac) and eluted using a 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/70% acetonitrile solvent system changing at 1% for Solvent B every 3 min. Cyclized peptide elutes from the column 1–2 min earlier in the gradient than uncyclized peptides or dimerized peptides formed by intermolecular disulfide formation. Fractions containing the purified peptide were pooled, frozen, and lyophilized. Representative samples from different lots were checked for purity and correct mass by matrix-assisted laser desorption or ion-spray mass spectrometry. Cloned cDNAs for mouse α (19Isenberg K.E.

Engel) were ligated into the mammalian expression vector pRBG4 at EcoRI sites for transient expression in HEK293 cells (26Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutants of the wild-type mouse ε, rat ε, mouse α, and human α subunits were made by one of two methods. Complementary synthetic oligonucleotides (Sigma/Genosys, The Woodlands, TX) containing the desired mutation were ligated into the cDNA at unique restriction sites flanking the mutated region. If convenient restriction sites were not available, the Stratagene double primer method was used. In this procedure, complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation served as primers in a PCR amplification reaction containing the wild-type plasmid andPfu polymerase. Following 16 to 18 amplification cycles in which the entire plasmid was made synthetically, the reaction was digested with DpnI restriction enzyme, which only digests the methylated, wild-type plasmid DNA, leaving behind the newly synthesized DNA. Mutations were subcloned into vectors not subjected to mutagenesis and verified initially by restriction digests and then by DNA sequencing. Large-scale plasmid preparations were made using DEAE columns (Invitrogen or Qiagen) or by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation. All individual subunit cDNAs for the nAChR are contained on unique plasmids using the cytomegalovirus promoter-based pRBG4 vector (27Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate, the media was changed 12–16 h later, and the experiments were performed 1–2 days after the media change. Transfected cells were removed from the culture plates by gentle agitation with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mm EDTA. After incubating the dissociated cells with Wtx-1 for 45 min to 1 h, 5 nm125I-α-bungarotoxin (125I-α-BgTx) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added and allowed to incubate for 20–40 min such that at 30–50% of the available binding sites become occupied (28Sine S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Waglerin dissociation constants were determined from the fractional reduction of the initial rate of 125I-α-BgTx binding. The total number of sites was determined by incubating with 20 nm125I-α-BgTx for 1 h. Nonspecific binding was determined by incubating the cells with 10 mm carbachol before reacting with 125I-α-BgTx. We measured Wtx-1 binding by competition against the initial rate of 125I-α-BgTx binding to intact HEK cells transfected with cDNAs encoding adult nAChR from mouse or rat. Wtx-1 binds to mouse nAChR with two distinct dissociation constants differing by 2100-fold, whereas it binds to rat nAChR with dissociation constants differing by only 80-fold (Fig.1). Because full activation of the nAChR requires simultaneous binding of two agonist molecules, and antagonists block activation by occupying only one of the two sites, the very different dissociation constants at one site underlie the species specificity of Wtx-1 in vivo. To determine which nAChR subunits mediate Wtx-1 selectivity between mouse and rat nAChRs, we substituted the mouse ε subunit into the rat nAChR and the rat ε subunit into the mouse nAChR. Combining the mouse ε subunit with rat α, β, and δ subunits yields a binding profile approaching that of the wild-type mouse nAChR, with the dissociation constant for the high affinity site only 2-fold greater than the all mouse subunit reference. Conversely, combining the rat ε subunit with mouse α, β, and δ subunits yields a binding profile approaching that of the wild-type rat nAChR; the dissociation constant of the high affinity site in the hybrid nAChR is identical to that in the all rat reference, whereas the dissociation constant of the low affinity site coincides with that in the all mouse reference. These results show that the ε subunit mediates the mouse/rat species selectivity by affecting Wtx-1 affinity for the α-ε binding site interface. Experiments replacing the ε subunit with the fetal γ subunit confirm that the ε subunit confers high affinity binding of Wtx-1 (29Taylor P. Osaka H. Molles B.E. Sugiyama N. Marchot P. Ackermann E.J. Malany S. McArdle J.J. Sine S.M. Tsigelny I. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 2B. E. Molles, unpublished observations. Of the 218 amino acids forming the extracellular domain responsible for ligand recognition, only 10 differ between mouse and rat ε subunits. To determine which of the 10 residues mediates species specificity, we constructed chimeric ε subunits from rat and mouse using a common AflIII restriction site near the codon for amino acid 83. The isolated restriction fragments were ligated to make chimeric subunits, designated εrat83mouse and εmouse83rat, roughly bisecting the extracellular domain. When combined with mouse α, β, and δ subunits, each chimera produced Wtx-1 affinities intermediate between those for wild-type mouse and rat (Fig.2). The intermediate affinities indicate at least two determinants of Wtx-1 selectivity, one N-terminal and one C-terminal to the junction at position 83. Of the four N-terminal residue differences, only positions 59 and 61 are near the ligand recognition site (1Corringer P.J., Le Novère N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), whereas positions 67 and 76 are in or near the main immunogenic region removed from the binding site (30Tzartos S.J. Cung M.T. Demange P. Loutrari H. Mamalaki A. Marraud M. Papadouli I. Sakarellos C. Tsikaris V. Mol. Neurobiol. 1991; 5: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Of the six C-terminal residues, positions 168 and 115 are near the ligand recognition site. Candidate residues C-terminal to 115 at the interface can be ruled out from a comparison of affinities of two mouse γ-ε chimeras that we generated. γ165ε and γ171ε yielded near identical K D values, 11.4 and 9.3 μm. Hence, residue 168, which differs between mouse and rat ε as well as between mouse ε and mouse γ by having a T to A substitution, is an unlikely determinant of Waglerin affinity. To determine which residues mediate species selectivity, we worked with the mouse ε subunit and mutated all four N-terminal residue differences and one C-terminal difference. Of the four N-terminal mutations, only εD59E reduced affinity to that observed for the εrat83mouse chimera (Fig. 3 and TableI). In the C-terminal region, εY115S reduced affinity to that observed for the εmouse83rat chimera (Fig.3). These intermediate Wtx-1 affinities suggest that residues at positions 59 and 115 account for selectivity between mouse and rat nAChRs.Table IMouse and rat ɛ subunit species mutations and dissociation constantsMutant subunitK D, α-ɛK D, α-δK D, α-δ/K D, α-ɛΔK D, α-ɛΔK D, α-δnnmμmMouse αβδɛ9.820.42100(1.0)(1.0)26Rat αβδɛ112081681224.03αβδ rat + ɛ mouse16.790.454001.74.42Rat ɛ124021.9181271.15ɛmouse83rat13424.0180141.22ɛrat83mouse79.714.518080.72Mouse ɛD59E28027.998291.44Mouse ɛD59N29.017.159030.83Mouse ɛD59Q47.033.972051.73Mouse ɛD59A10.818.117001.10.92Mouse ɛH61Q5.116.323000.50.81Mouse ɛY67F4.713.729000.50.71Mouse ɛG76E4.610.222000.50.51Mouse ɛY115S89.221.224091.03Mouse ɛY115F17.418.511001.80.93Mouse ɛD59E+Y115S47526.456481.33Rat ɛE59D8417.621090.93Rat ɛE59N18934.4180191.74Rat ɛE59Q43035.482441.73Rat ɛS115Y21228.5130221.43Rat ɛS115F40825.462421.22Rat ɛE59D+S115Y5.222.346000.51.32The ɛ subunit of the given species was cotransfected with mouse α, β, and δ subunits unless indicated otherwise.K D, α-ɛ and K D, α-δwere determined from full concentration curves as shown in Figs. 1 and2.

Open table in a new tab The ɛ subunit of the given species was cotransfected with mouse α, β, and δ subunits unless indicated otherwise.K D, α-ɛ and K D, α-δwere determined from full concentration curves as shown in Figs. 1 and2. ΔK D, α-ɛ and ΔK D, α-δ is the ratio of the dissociation constant to the corresponding subunit interface in the all mouse wild-type receptor. To determine whether residues at positions 59 and 115 together confer Wtx-1 selectivity, we constructed the corresponding double mutations in mouse and rat ε subunits. The mouse double mutant ε(D59E/Y115S) reduces Wtx-1 affinity to within 2-fold of the wild-type rat ε subunit. Conversely, the rat double mutant ε(E59D/S115Y) increases Wtx-1 affinity to within 2-fold of the wild-type mouse ε subunit (Fig. 3 and Table I). Thus species selectivity of Wtx-1 can be closely mimicked by substituting residues at positions 59 and 115 of the ε subunit. Once the primary determinants of Waglerin affinity were identified, we characterized how each receptor determinant interacts with Wtx-1. Working with the mouse ε subunit, we mutated Asp-59 to Ala (the corresponding residue in mouse δ), Asn (to remove the negative charge), and Gln (the corresponding residue of mouse γ). The resulting rank order of affinity for mouse ε 59 residues is Asp = Ala > Asn ≥ Gln > Glu (Table I). Removing the charge does not in itself significantly decrease affinity (no change, 3-fold, or 5-fold for the Ala, Asn, and Gln substitutions, respectively). Changing the Asp to a Glu, which increases the length of the side chain by one methylene group, causes the largest decrease. These observations indicate that the interaction at residue 59 is not purely electrostatic, but instead is mediated by a combination of electrostatic and other stabilizing forces within a confined space. Steric occlusion incurred by addition of a single methylene in the side chain may alter the position of the charge or the orientation of bound Waglerin. In the rat ε mutants tested, the affinities followed a similar rank order, Asp > Asn > Gln > Glu (Table I), further showing that both electrostatic forces and steric constraints mediate the interaction at residue 59. Position 115 of the ε subunit of both rat and mouse nAChR was mutated to Phe and Ser to determine the role of the aromatic ring in governing affinity for Wtx-1. For both rat and mouse ε subunits, the rank order of Wtx-1 affinity was Tyr > Phe > Ser at position 115, indicating that both the aromatic ring and the hydroxyl group contribute to high affinity binding of Wtx-1 at the α-ε interface. We next compared Wtx-1 binding to human nAChR with that for mouse nAChR. Wtx-1 binds to human nAChR with two distinct affinities, but compared with mouse nAChR, it shows 70-fold lower affinity at the α-ε site and 10-fold lower affinity at the α-δ site (Fig. 4). To determine whether the ε subunit contributes to the low affinity of human nAChR, we coexpressed mouse α, β, and δ subunits with human ε. The resulting hybrid nAChRs bind Wtx-1 with 14-fold lower affinity at the α-ε site compared with the all mouse reference, indicating that some of the lower affinity for human nAChR originates in the ε subunit. Although no human ε mutants were tested, the human ε, like rat, has a Ser at residue 115, a residue shown to mediate reduced affinity of rat ε. On the other hand, human ε contains Asp at position 59, like mouse, which promotes high affinity for the nAChR. Thus, Ser-115 in human ε should be a primary determinant for the human-mouse difference in affinity. To determine whether the α subunit contributes to low affinity of human nAChR, we cotransfected human α with mouse β, ε, and δ subunits. The resulting hybrid nAChRs bind Wtx-1 with 10-fold lower affinity at both binding sites compared with the all mouse reference, indicating that the α subunit is also responsible for the low affinity of human nAChR. We therefore constructed chimeric α subunits composed of mouse and human sequences to identify residues responsible for the mouse/human affinity difference. Residues 1–124 of the mouse α subunit were joined with residues 125–496 of human α, and residues 1–172 of human were joined to 173–496 of the mouse α subunit. When mouse sequence occupies positions 1–124 of the α subunit, Wtx-1 binding coincides with that of the wild-type human α subunit (Fig. 4 B), indicating that residues C-terminal to residue 124 affect affinity. On the other hand, when human sequence occupies positions 1–172, Wtx-1 binding coincides with that of the all mouse reference, indicating that residues C-terminal to position 172 affect affinity. The mouse-human α subunit chimeras, therefore, indicate that the determinants of the affinity difference are C-terminal to position 172 in the α subunit. Between position 172 and the first transmembrane span at position 210, four residues differ between the mouse and human wild-type α subunits: positions 181, 187, 189, and 195. We therefore generated point mutations at each of these positions in both mouse and human subunits, mutating each residue to that in the other species. Each mutant α subunit was cotransfected with mouse wild-type β, δ, and ε subunits, and Wtx-1 binding was measured. For mutations at positions 181 and 195, virtually no change in affinity is observed in either mouse or human α subunits (TableII). For positions 187 and 189, a more complex interplay of the two residues is evident. The mouse αW187S mutation decreases Wtx-1 affinity only 2-fold at both sites, and the corresponding human mutant (human αS187W) increases affinity 2- and 4-fold (Fig. 5, A andB). At position 189, the mouse mutation (αF189T) reduces affinity to that for human α, but the human mutant (αT189F) increases affinity only 2-fold at each site (Fig. 5, A andB). Changing both residues simultaneously in the human αS187W/T189F double mutant gives nearly identical affinities to the wild-type mouse α at both sites. However, the mouse αW187S/F189T double mutant decreases affinity 3-fold at each site, less than the αF189T single mutant alone (Table II).Table IIMouse and human α subunit mutations to mimic species differences between nAchRSubunit transfectedK D, α-ɛK D, α-δK D, α-δ/K D, α-ɛΔK D, α-ɛΔK D, α-δnnmμmMouse α9.820.42100(1.0)(1.0)26Human αβδɛ69220029071106Human α8420024009107Human ɛ (+mouse αβδ)14219.3140140.92α Mouse 124human78.11612100882α Human 172mouse8.616.920000.90.82Human αS181A11214913001176Human αS187W27.21294800363Human αT189F48.893.71900555Human αD195T11515714001283Human αS187W + T189F10.137.437001.01.85Mouse αA181S17.420.312001.81.04Mouse α W187S23.132.9140021.64Mouse αF189T135101750145.05Mouse αT195D16.613.07801.70.63Mouse αW187S + F189T26.466.52500334All experiments performed on HEK cells transfected with mouse wild-type β, δ, and ɛ subunits and the given α subunit unless otherwise specified.

This most likely results from a disparity between 125I-α-BgTx association rates at the α-ε site compared with the α-δ site, where association is faster at the α-δ site. Our results clearly show that the 187 position is critical to determining this difference in association rates. The presence of Ser at position 187, whether in the wild-type human α, in the mouse αW187S mutant or the mouse αW187S/F189T double mutant, leads to a lower apparent ratio of α-ε to α-δ sites. Conversely, the presence of Trp in the wild-type mouse, the human αS187W mutant, or the human αS187W/T189F double mutant, leads to a 1:1 ratio of α-ε to α-δ sites (Fig. 5 B). Thus the residue at 187 position governs the relative rate of α-BgTx association at the α-ε and α-δ sites. A wide variety of toxins from both animal and plant sources are known to aid the predatory species or protect other species from predation by blocking motor activity. Because acetylcholine is the motor transmitter in fish and higher forms of terrestrial animals, the nicotinic receptor is a prevalent target for lophotoxins from coral, α-conotoxins from fish-hunting cone snails, alkaloids from certain plants and amphibians, and α-neurotoxins from Elapid snakes (29Taylor P. Osaka H. Molles B.E. Sugiyama N. Marchot P. Ackermann E.J. Malany S. McArdle J.J. Sine S.M. Tsigelny I. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The Waglerins add to the structural diversity of nicotinic receptor blocking agents in that they contain a novel structural motif and reveal a structural specificity distinct from other peptide toxins. For example, α-conotoxin MI shows the binding site interface selectivity α-δ > α-ε > α-γ in the mouse nAChR (31Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), whereas the short three-fingered α-toxin from Naja mossambica mossambica has interface selectivity α-γ = α-δ > α-ε (32Osaka H. Malany S. Kanter J.R. Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9581-9586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Waglerin preference is α-ε > α-δ = α-γ in mouse, the species in which the highest affinity has been detected (29Taylor P. Osaka H. Molles B.E. Sugiyama N. Marchot P. Ackermann E.J. Malany S. McArdle J.J. Sine S.M. Tsigelny I. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Hence, characterization of the specificity of this relatively simple peptide should yield valuable information on receptor structure. The present work illustrates an emerging principle relating nAChR binding site structure to agonist and competitive antagonist binding. The subunit interface is designed to bind ACh with low affinity in the resting state and to bind ACh much more tightly when in the open channel and desensitized states. This state dependence of the nAChR binding site implies a very delicate design, which is mediated by conserved residues that do not tol"

(1993) Mol. Cell Biol. 13, 3522–3529; Shen, C. P., and Kadesch, T. (1995)Mol. Cell Biol. 15, 4518–4524; Jacobs, Y., et al. (1994)Mol. Cell Biol. 14, 4087–4096; Wilson, R. B., et al. (1991) Mol. Cell Biol. 11, 6185–6191). These homodimers, however, have little activity on myogenic enhancers (Weintraub, H., Genetta, T., and Kadesch, T. (1994) Genes Dev. 8, 2203–2211). We report here the identification of a novelcis-acting transcriptional repression domain in the E protein family of bHLH transcription factors. This domain, the Rep domain, is present in each of the known vertebrate E proteins. Extensive mapping analysis demonstrates that this domain is an acidic region of 30 amino acids with a predicted loop structure. Fusion studies indicate that the Rep domain can repress both of the E protein transactivation domains (AD1 and AD2). Physiologically, the Rep domain plays a key role in maintaining E protein homodimers in an inactive state on myogenic enhancers. In addition, we demonstrate that Rep domain mediated repression of AD1 is a necessary for the function of MyoD-E protein heterodimeric complexes. These studies demonstrate that the Rep domain is important for modulating the transcriptional activity of E proteins and provide key insights into both the selectivity and mechanism of action of E protein containing bHLH protein complexes.

Structurally, the bHLH domain is a 60-amino acid region containing two helices separated by a loop segment preceded by a region rich in basic residues. The basic region is responsible for DNA binding and the HLH region is important for dimerization with other members of the family (2Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D.

There are three E protein family members in mammals, E2A (with three major splice products: E12, E47, and E2-5), E2-2 (also called ITF2) and HEB (2Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D.

Cell fate decisions are often regulated by alterations in the expression of these tissue-specific proteins. Finally, class III members include the dominant negative Id proteins that heterodimerize with the E proteins but, because they lack a basic domain, form heterodimeric complexes incapable of binding DNA (12Benezra R.

Cell. 1994; 79: 875-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The E proteins have two transcriptional activation domains, activation domain1 (AD1) and 2 (AD2) (21Aronheim A.

AD1 is contained within the first 100 amino acids of the protein and contains a putative α-helix. AD2, also termed the loop-helix domain, is located midway between the AD1 and bHLH domains. The transcriptional activation domains of the E proteins play a critical role in cellular transformation in the context of chimeric oncoproteins such as E2A-HLF and E2A-Pbx1 (24Inaba T. Roberts W.M.

Site selection studies have suggested that enhancer selection by specific bHLH complexes is to some extent regulated by the sequences within and surrounding the E box (27Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Binding site selection is not sufficient, however, to explain the specificity of action of many bHLH proteins. It has been demonstrated that the myogenic bHLH protein MyoD can bind to the B cell-specific immunoglobulin enhancer, but is transcriptionally inactive as a result of a cis-acting repressive element in the enhancer (28Weintraub H. Genetta T. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similarly, E protein homodimers can bind to E boxes within myogenic enhancers, but these complexes are almost entirely inactive (28Weintraub H. Genetta T. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The mode of repression of these E protein homodimers is unknown. In this study, we have identified a novel autoregulatory domain common to all of the vertebrate E proteins. This domain, which we term the Rep domain, is a potent inhibitor of the AD1 and AD2 transcriptional activation domains. We demonstrate that the Rep domain plays a key role in inactivating E protein homodimers bound to a myogenic enhancer. In addition, this domain is required to form active MyoD-E protein heterodimeric complexes by repressing AD1, which is inhibitory on theMCK enhancer. Thus, the Rep domain modulates the activity of E protein-containing bHLH protein complexes and may play a key role in regulating the activity of complexes bound to tissue-specific enhancers. Full-length E2-2 andE12 were amplified by PCR and cloned into a pcDNAIII vector (Invitrogen). All GAL4 DNA binding domain fusions were constructed by ligation of E protein DNA in-frame into a modified pM3 vector (1Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene. 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Deletions of E12 and E2-2 were generated by use of appropriate restriction enzyme sites and by PCR. E12ΔAD1 ΔAD2 and E12Δrep ΔAD1 ΔAD2 were cloned into pFLAG CMV2 vector (Kodak). All constructs were verified by sequencing. EMC11S is the expression vector for MyoD (29Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). Reporter vectors used were: multimerized E box driving chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), 4RtkCAT (30Weintraub H. Davis R. Lockshon D. Lassar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5623-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar); multimerized GAL4 binding sites driving luciferase, GAL4-luc (31Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M.

Grundstrom). Site-directed mutagenesis of the Rep domain was performed with a Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit as per the manufacture's instructions (Stratagene). The following oligonucleotides were used for mutagenesis: 5′-GCGGCCGCGGCCGCTGCGGCCAAATCCGATGACGAG-3′ (mutant 1); 5′-GCGGCCGCTGAGATCGCAGCCGATGACGAGGGTG-3′ (mutant 2); 5′-GCTGAGATCAAATCCGCTGCCGAGGGTGATGAGAAC-3′ (mutant 3); 5′-GATCAAATCCGATGACGCGGCTGATGAGAACCTGCAAG-3′ (mutant 4); 5′-CCGATGACGAGGGTGCTGCGAACCTGCAAGACACG-3′ (mutant 5); 5′-GACGAGGGTGATGAGGCCGCGCAAGACACGAAATC-3′ (mutant 6); 5′-GGTGATGAGAACCTGGCAGCCACGAAATCTTCGGAG-3′ (mutant 7); 5′-GAGAACCTGCAAGACGCGGCATCTTCGGAGGACAAG-3′ (mutant 8); 5′-CTGCAAGACACGAAAGCTGCGGAGGACAAGAAATTAG-3′ (mutant 9); 5′-GACACGAAATCTTCGGCGGCCAAGAAATTAGATGAC-3′ (mutant 10); 5′-CGAAATCTTCGGAGGACGCGGCATTAGATGACGACAA-3′ (mutant 11); 5′-CGGAGGACAAGAAAGCAGCTGACGACAAGAAG-3′ (mutant 12); 5′-GACAAGAAATTAGATGCCGCCAAGAAGGATGAATTC-3′ (mutant 13); 5′-GAAATTAGATGACGACGCGGCGGCTGAATTCTAGATA-3′ (mutant 14). Mismatched nucleotides are indicated in boldface. All constructs described above were verified by DNA sequencing. HeLa, C3H10T1/2, and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone) and plated at 50% confluence into six-well dishes (HeLa and C3H10T1/2) or 6-cm dishes (COS-7 cells) 12–24 h prior to transfection. HeLa cells were transfected with 0.5 mg of expression vector along with either 0.1 mg of 4RtkCAT or 0.1 mg of GAL4-luc reporter by the calcium phosphate method and maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS for 48 h before harvesting for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or luciferase assays. C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with 0.5 mg of expression plasmid and 0.5 mg of MCK luciferase using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) or FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions and maintained in DMEM containing 10 mg/ml insulin 5 mg/ml transferrin without FBS for 48 h before harvesting for luciferase assays. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant. Cells were harvested by disruption with Reporter Lysis Buffer (for CAT assays) or Cell Culture Lysis Buffer (for luciferase assays) (Promega). Equal amounts of protein were assayed for each sample. Luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer (Berthold Lumat LB9501) using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). CAT activity was measured by a non-chromatographic CAT assay (32Sleigh M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Each transfection was repeated at least three times in triplicate. Data shown represent the average of triplicate values for a typical assay with standard deviations. COS-7 cells were plated at a 50% confluence and transfected with 3 mg of expression plasmid 12–24 h later by the calcium phosphate method. Nuclear extracts were prepared after 48 h according to the procedure of Schreiber et al. (33Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). 60 mg of protein was fractionated on a 10% discontinuous SDS gel and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose filter. After transfer, the filter was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 5% milk. Primary antibody incubation was carried out at room temperature for 1 h in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 200 ng/ml anti-GAL4 DBD antibody (sc-577, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). After primary antibody binding, the filter was washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Secondary antibody incubation was carried out at room temperature for 1 h in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:10,000. The filter was then washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). All mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (12Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). 6 mg of soluble nuclear protein was incubated with probe DNA for 5 min at room temperature. Supershifts were performed by addition of 1 mg of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma Chemical Co.) to the binding reaction prior to gel loading. The DNA binding buffer contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 6% glycerol, and 100 mg/ml poly(dI-dC). The upper strand of the oligonucleotides used as probes were as follows: E box (sense), 5′-CCCCAACACCTGCCTGCCTGA-3′; Gal binding site (sense), 5′-GATCCGGAGTACTGTCCTCCG-3′. C3H10T1/2 cells transfected with expression plasmids were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and washed three times in PBS. Slides were blocked with MOM™ Kit (Vector Laboratories) blocking reagent (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), incubated with anti-myocin-heavy-chain antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) overnight at 4 °C, then incubated 1 h with anti-mouse IgG-Texas Red-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at room temperature. After three final washes in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% IGPEL, slides were mounted with SlowFade mounting reagent (Molecular Probe). In a screen to map functional domains in E2-2, sequences in and around activation domain 2 (AD2) (226–450) of E2-2 were fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4. These expression plasmids were cotransfected into HeLa cells with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing five GAL4 DNA binding sites, and luciferase activity was quantitated after 24 h. A GAL-E2-2 fusion that spans residues 226–540 is a very poor transcriptional activator (Fig.1) whereas a shorter GAL4-E2-2 fusion containing amino acids 226–493 is 82.3-fold more active. This suggested that E2-2 contains a domain capable of partially inactivating AD2. To test whether E12 (a product of the E2A gene) also contains this domain, the GAL4 fusion domain studies were repeated with E12 (Fig. 1). A fusion of amino acids 230–524, containing AD2 and significant C-terminal residues, was also a poor stimulator of the GAL4 reporter. Deletion of 33 amino acids (residues 492–524) activated luciferase expression by 18.3-fold. These data led us to hypothesize that E proteins contain a transcriptional repression domain downstream of AD2. To further map the repression domain of E2-2, amino acids between residues 450 and 578 were added incrementally to a transcriptionally active GAL4-E2-2 fusion containing the minimal AD2 domain (amino acids 226–450). As shown in Fig.2 A, addition of amino acids 450–493 had no significant effect on transcriptional activity. Inclusion of an additional 28 residues (amino acids 493–521) produced a 2-fold repression. Addition of amino acids 521–530 led to a further 1.5-fold repression and amino acids 530–540 resulted in an additional 4.1-fold repression. Overall, 12.2-fold repression of AD2 was observed by inclusion of residues 493–540. Larger additions, including a previously characterized dimerization repression domain (amino acids 540–556) (13Sun X.H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and the basic domain (amino acids 556–578), led to no further effects on transcriptional activity. A refinement of the location of the repression domain was achieved by removing residues C-terminal to amino acid 450 incrementally in a fully repressed GAL4-E2-2 (226–540) construct (Fig. 2 A). Deletion of residues 493–502, 493–511, and 450–511 had no effect on the transcriptional activity of the Gal4 E2-2 construct. Deletion of residues C-terminal to 511 (Gal E2-2 (226–540 Δ450–521) or Gal E2-2 (226–540 Δ450–528)) or N-terminal to 540 (Gal E2-2 (226–533 Δ450–521)), however, resulted in significant derepression. From these data, we conclude that the repression domain (which we term the Rep domain) is located between amino acids 511 and 540 (highlighted in Fig. 2 A) and is capable of inactivating AD2 of E2-2. The Rep domain functions in multiple cell types as identical results were observed in COS-7, 293T, Namalwa, and 2017 cells (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that the alterations in transcriptional activities described in Fig. 2 A were the result of alterations in GAL4 fusion protein levels, Western blot analysis using an anti-GAL4 antibody was performed on soluble nuclear protein extracted from transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 2 B, each of the constructs yields a comparable amount of Gal4 fusion protein recovered from the transfected cells. To determine if the GAL4 fusions bound DNA with equal efficiency, these extracts were incubated with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the minimal 21-bp GAL4 DNA element, and protein-DNA complexes were resolved on non-denaturing gels. As shown in Fig. 2 C, each fusion protein was equally efficient in forming a complex with DNA. These results suggest that the Rep domain affects transcriptional activity of E2-2 without significantly altering protein steady-state levels or DNA binding efficiency. We sought to determine whether the repression domain between positions 511 and 540 defined above was also capable of altering transcriptional activity in the context of non-GAL4 linked E2-2. Transfection of full-length E2-2 results in a 3.1-fold activation of a multimerized E box reporter above background (Fig. 2 D). Deletion of amino acids 450–540 resulted in a 4.4-fold increase in activity above full-length E2-2. Deletion of residues 493–540 or 521–540 had a similar stimulatory effect indicating that critical elements of the repression domain are present between amino acids 521 and 540 in the context of full-length E2-2. Deletion of residues 493–502, 493–511, and 226–280 resulted in no stimulation of E2-2. This analysis demonstrates that the Rep domain functions in full-length E2-2 homodimers and maps to the same region (residues 511–540) defined in the Gal4 fusion experiments (highlighted in Fig. 2 A). To confirm that repression is not due to an alteration in the DNA binding capacity of the E2-2 constructs, nuclear extracts from transfected cells were incubated with a radiolabeled E-box containing oligonucleotide, and protein-DNA complexes were resolved by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 E). An equivalent concentration of E box binding activity was present in cells transfected with the various E2-2 constructs. These data demonstrate that the transcriptional repression mechanism is unrelated to alterations in the dimerization or DNA binding capacity of E2-2. The minimal E2-2 Rep domain was fused to AD1 and AD2 of E2-2 and to the activation domain of the viral transcription activator VP16. Each of these chimeric proteins was expressed as a fusion with the GAL4 DNA binding domain. As shown in Fig. 3 A, fusion of the Rep domain onto AD1 (top panel) and AD2 (middle panel) repressed transactivation to nearly background levels indicating that the Rep domain is sufficient for transcriptional inhibition. Fusion of the Rep domain onto the VP16 activation domain, however, had no significant effect on transcription, indicating at least some degree of specificity for E protein activation domains. We observed, however, that the Rep domain cannot inhibit E protein activation domains when bound separately to an adjacent DNA element (data not shown), suggesting that the Rep domain may function exclusively as an intramolecular transcriptional repressor. Examination of the Rep domain sequence reveals a region rich in polar and charged amino acids (particularly lysine, aspartic, and glutamic acid) that is remarkably conserved within the E protein family in all characterized vertebrate E proteins (Fig. 3 B). Overall, the Rep domain of human E2-2 and Zebrafish E12 are 43% identical. PHD (Profile network predictionHeiDelberg) analysis predicted this stretch of amino acids to adopt a flexible loop structure. To assess the contribution of each amino acid residue to the Rep domain function, we performed alanine scan mutagenesis. Each residue of the Rep domain was altered to alanine (two at a time), and mutants were assayed for the ability to repress a minimal AD2 domain. Two mutants, m4 and m6 (corresponding to resides 518–519 and 522–523, respectively) clearly affect the inhibitory function of Rep, which results in a dramatic restoration of AD2 transcriptional activity (Fig.3 C). Mutation of individual residues of the pairs had little effect by themselves (data not shown). These data suggest that residues Glu-518 and Glu-519, as well as Asn-522 and Leu-523 are crucial for Rep domain inhibitory function. Given that the Rep domain is highly conserved in E proteins (Figs. 1 and 3 B), we utilized the E12 molecule exclusively for the remainder of the experiments because of its high expression level and transactivation potential in a variety of lymphocytic and myogenic genes. We sought to determine if the Rep domain was responsible for maintaining E protein homodimers in an inactive state on the MCK enhancer. As shown in Fig.4 A, MyoD strongly activates transcription from the MCK enhancer, whereas E12 is completely inactive. Deletion of the Rep domain alone (E12Δrep) had no effect on E12 activity. However, when activation domain 1 (AD1) was also deleted (E12Δrep ΔAD1), E12 became a potent transcriptional activator on the MCK enhancer. A molecule missing only AD1 (E12ΔAD1), however, lacked detectable transactivation potential. These data suggested that both AD1 and Rep interfere with homodimer activation of the MCK enhancer. We also demonstrated that E12Δrep ΔAD1 drives the MCK enhancer via AD2, because deletion of AD2 (E12Δrep ΔAD1 ΔAD2) results in complete inactivation of the molecule. These results demonstrate that E proteins lacking a Rep domain can inappropriately stimulate a myogenic enhancer via AD2 but AD1 interferes with this activation. To evaluate this phenomenon on endogenous muscle gene expression, we performed immunofluorescence analysis on 10T1/2 cells transiently transfected with our E protein mutants. 10T1/2 cells were cultured on chamber slides and transfected with plasmids, and immunofluorescence was performed using anti-Myocin-heavy-chain antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 B, pcDNA (vector control)-, E12-, E12Δrep-, and E12ΔAD1-transfected cells showed little staining, whereas MyoD- and E12Δrep ΔAD1-transfected cells showed intense cytoplasmic staining. These results indicate that E12Δrep ΔAD1 alone has the ability to activate endogenous MCK gene expression, whereas wild type E12, E12Δrep, and E12ΔAD1 cannot. Taken together, these results imply that the AD2 domain can induce a full range of active myogenic responses, and that both the Rep and AD1 domains play a negative regulatory role by direct or indirect inactivation of the AD2 domain, thereby preventing E12 homodimer transactivation ofMCK. During muscle development, E proteins activate the MCK enhancer as heterodimeric complexes with MyoD. To determine if the Rep domain plays a role in heterodimer activity, E12 and E12Δrep were cotransfected with MyoD and anMCK reporter. Surprisingly, removal of the Rep domain of E12 consistently repressed MyoD-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.5 A). Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrates that this repression event is not due to an altered efficiency in forming MyoD-E12 heterodimers or in binding DNA, because both E12 and E12Δrep form strong DNA binding complexes with MyoD (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5 and 6). Because the Rep domain behaves as an intramolecular transcriptional repressor, and AD1 also acts as a repressor that inhibits E protein homodimer transactivation function (Fig. 4 A), we hypothesized that activity of MyoD-E12 complexes is dependent on masking of the AD1 repressive activity by the Rep domain. MyoD-E12Δrep complexes would be unable to perform this masking event but should regain wild type activity if the relevant activation domain was inactivated. To test this, we made use of the E12 mutant proteins with targeted deletions of AD1 and AD2. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the E12 mutant lacking both Rep and AD1 domains (E12ΔRepΔAD1) are fully capable of acting synergistically with MyoD on the MCK enhancer, confirming our hypothesis. AD1's repressive function in the MyoD-E12 complex was further supported by the observation that the E12 mutant lacking AD1 alone (E12ΔAD1) showed higher transactivation potential compared with wild type (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, mutants with targeted deletions of AD2 are inactive in MyoD-dependent transcription, both in the presence and absence of the Rep domain. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis using extracts from transfected cells demonstrates that these activity differences are not the result of altered expression or DNA binding efficiency (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the MyoD-E heterodimer stimulates a myogenic enhancer via AD2 and requires Rep-domain-mediated repression of AD1 (see model, Fig. 6 B). Thus the AD1 domain of E protein is repressive on the MCK enhancer, both in the context of E protein homodimer or MyoD-E protein heterodimer, and its repression activity is suppressed by the Rep domain only as a heterodimer (see model, Fig. 6). E protein complexes are potent transcriptional activators and are highly specific for the enhancers they stimulate. As homodimers, E proteins directly stimulate transcription from the B lymphocyte-specific IgH and Igk enhancers and thereby facilitate immunoglobulin gene rearrangement (14Bain G. Gruenwald S.

E protein homodimers also directly or indirectly stimulate the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), l5, EBF, and RAG genes in vivo (18Kee B.L. Murre C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 699-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 38Schlissel M. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1367-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). As heterodimers with MyoD, E protein complexes stimulate transcription of muscle-specific genes such as muscle creatine kinase (MCK) and myosin light chain (39Lassar A.B. Buskin J.N. Lockshon D. Davis R.L. Apone S. Hauschka S.D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). MyoD-E protein heterodimers bind E boxes in the immunoglobulin enhancer but are transcriptionally inactive as a result of a cis-acting repression region on the enhancer (28Weintraub H. Genetta T. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Conversely, E protein homodimers bind E boxes in the MCK enhancer, but their activities are completely repressed. The mechanisms the cell uses for recognition and inactivation of E protein homodimers bound to non-lymphocyte enhancers are largely unknown. In this study, we have identified a novel cis-acting transcriptional repression domain in the E proteins that plays a role in modulating the activity of bHLH complexes in an enhancer-specific manner. The Rep domain is a charged 30-amino acid region, highly conserved among the vertebrate E proteins, which is capable of repressing E protein activation domains 1 and 2. In E protein homodimers bound inappropriately to a myogenic enhancer, the Rep domain and AD1 cooperate in preventing transcriptional activation. In MyoD-E protein heterodimers bound to the MCK enhancer, the Rep domain is critical for transcriptional activation by masking negative signals derived from AD1. The Rep domain, then, is an intramolecular transcriptional repressor that plays a role in modulating the activity of enhancer-bound bHLH protein complexes. The Rep domain is a potent transcriptional repressor that inhibits the activities of the AD1 and AD2 domains of the E proteins. This repression is somewhat specific to these domains, because VP16 activity is unaffected by the addition of this domain. Work to determine Rep domain-interacting partners is ongoing. We have demonstrated that AD1 is repressive for theMCK enhancer both in the context of E protein homodimeric and MyoD-E heterodimeric complexes. This domain is normally active in E protein homodimers and is indeed required for activation of the immunoglobulin enhancer (data not shown). In MyoD-E heterodimers, AD1 is masked by the Rep domain, which allows AD2 to stimulate myogenic enhancers. The mechanism by which AD1 represses myogenic enhancers is unknown. We propose that either AD1 recruits a transcriptional repressor when bound to the MCK enhancer or AD1-recruited transcriptional coactivators interfere with myogenic enhancer function. These possibilities are currently being evaluated. The Rep domain may inhibit AD1's repression function in E protein heterodimers by preventing the recruitment of RNAPII or coactivators, such as histone acetyltransferase containing transcriptional cofactor, SWI/SNF complexes or mediators (40Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 41Qiu Y. Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 2957-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We suspect, therefore, that the Rep domain is capable of preventing the assembly of several different transcriptional cofactor complexes. The simplest model we proposed in Fig. 6 with multiple functional interactions observed between AD1, AD2, and Rep domain is that multiple, sequential intramolecular interactions contribute to transactivation specificity. We presume that this kind of complex intramolecular regulation in E protein exists in part to permit a broad range of regulatory capabilities."

The degradation of glycogen largely followed the last-in-first-out principle, particularly in the initial period. Analysis of the size of the glycogen molecules and the β-dextrin limit during glycogen accumulation and degradation showed that both synthesis and degradation of glycogen molecules are largely sequential and the small deviation from this order is most pronounced at the beginning of the accumulation and at the end of the degradation period. This pattern may reflect the number of synthase and phosphorylase molecules and fits well with the role of glycogen in skeletal muscle as a readily available energy store and with the known structure of the glycogen molecule.

It is emphasized that the observed nonlinear relation between the change in glycogen concentration and release of label during glycogen degradation may have important practical consequences for interpretation of experimental data. Glycogen is a branched polymer of glucose of spherical geometry composed of ∼53,000 glucosyl residues for the fully synthesized molecule (β-glycogen). Glycogen plays a very dynamic role in the energy metabolism of skeletal muscle by serving as a readily available energy source during muscle contraction of high intensity (1Suarez R.K. Staples J.F. Lighton J.R.B. West T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7065-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 2Menléndez-Hevia E. Waddell T.G. Shelton E.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The spherical form and branched structure of glycogen appear to be optimally suited to fast breakdown by the glycogen phosphorylase and the debranching enzyme (2Menléndez-Hevia E. Waddell T.G. Shelton E.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The basic structure of glycogen consists of layers (tiers) of branched glucosyl chains with the protein glycogenin as the core. Each B-chain consists of 13 glucosyl residues linked by α[1→4] glucosyl bonds and gives rise to two new B-chains by way of the α[1→6] branch points (3Goldsmith E. Sprang S. Fletterick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 411-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This design principle is repeated until 11 layers of B-chains are formed and the synthesis is completed by the addition of one tier of A-chains of the same length as the B-chain, but without branch points (2Menléndez-Hevia E. Waddell T.G. Shelton E.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 4Devlin T.M. Textbook of Biochemistry. 4th Ed. Wiley-Liss, New York1997: 312-331Google Scholar). Further synthesis is not possible for steric reasons (2Menléndez-Hevia E. Waddell T.G. Shelton E.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For the first eight tiers, the α[1→4] glucosyl bonds are synthesized by proglycogen synthase and the α[1→6] branch points by branching enzyme, and the molecule is defined as proglycogen. For the last four tiers, the α[1→4] glucosyl bonds are synthesized by glycogen synthase and the α[1→6] branch point by branching enzyme, and the molecule is defined as β-glycogen. It is assumed that glycogen synthesis and degradation under dynamic physiological conditions involve only the four outer tiers (tiers 9–12) (5Lomako J. Lomako W.M. Whelan W.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6Lomako J. Lomako W.M. Whelan W.J. Dombro R.S. Neary J.T.

Evol. 1997; 45: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which, however, account for some 96% of the glucosyl residues of the full sized β-glycogen molecule. Proglycogen can therefore be considered a scaffold for the metabolically active four outer tiers of the β-glycogen molecule. For a full sized β-glycogen molecule, 35% of the glucosyl residues may be removed before the first debranching occurs (2Menléndez-Hevia E. Waddell T.G. Shelton E.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cognate with this highly ordered structure of the individual glycogen molecule (defined as intramolecular order), there may also be an intermolecular order, in the sense that all glycogen molecules are degraded/synthesized simultaneously. This has been investigated in adipocytes and in the liver (9Devos P. Hers H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 99: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Devos P. Hers H.G Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1031-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but not in skeletal muscles. The aim of the present work was to investigate: 1) whether synthesis and degradation in skeletal muscle of the individual glycogen molecule is a strictly ordered process with the last glucosyl unit incorporated into the molecule being the first to be released (the “last-in-first-out” principle), or if it is a random process; and 2) whether all glycogen molecules are synthesized and degraded in phase (simultaneous order) or out of phase (sequential order). One important practical consequence of this work is related to the interpretation of data, where the rate of glycogen degradation is estimated from the release of label from glycogen. With such data it is assumed that incorporation/release of label is proportional to actual incorporation/release of glucosyl units. Depending on the mechanism of synthesis and degradation, however, this may not have to be the case.

Muscles from 10–15 fetuses were finely cut with a pair of scissors for 10 min in 2 drops of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with 1% glucose and without Ca2+ and Mg2+(CMfDPBS), and transferred to a centrifuge glass with 10 ml of 0.1% collagenase I + 0.15% trypsin with EDTA + 0.01% DNase I in CMfDPBS. After incubation on a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min with shaking every 5 min for the first 20 min and every 2 min for the last 10 min, the digest was triturated 15 times at room temperature with a wide bore pipette tip, diluted with 10 ml (80% DMEM with 25 mmNaHCO3 and 25 mm glucose + 20% FCS), and centrifuged for 8 min at 270 × g. The cell pellet was suspended in 5 ml (80% DMEM with 25 mm NaHCO3and 25 mm glucose + 20% FCS) and filtered by syringe pressure through a 20-μm filter. The centrifuge tube was washed six times with 5 ml (80% DMEM with 25 mm NaHCO3and 25 mm glucose + 20% FCS), which was also passed through the filter. The filtrates were collected on a 150-mm uncoated culture dish and incubated for 45 min in 5% CO2 + 95% atmosphere air at 37 °C. The nonadhering cells were diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml, and 25 ml were plated on a 150-mm gelatin-coated culture dish, prepared by coating the dish with 10 ml of 0.1% gelatin for 2–3 h at 37 °C and removed by suction twice immediately before plating. The myoblasts were cultured to confluence for 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 + 95% atmosphere air, and were released from the dish by dispase treatment; the medium was removed by suction and 10 ml of 37 °C 0.025% dispase in CMfDPBS was added. After 1 min at room temperature, the solution was removed, 10 ml of the same solution was added, and the dishes incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The dispase solution was replaced by 10 ml (80% DMEM with 25 mm NaHCO3 and 25 mmglucose + 20% FCS) and the cells incubated for 25 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 + 95% atmosphere air. The medium was carefully removed and the myoblasts loosened by tapping the dish against the edge of a table for 1 min while rotating the dish. The cells were washed into a centrifuge tube by 5 ml (80% DMEM with 25 mmNaHCO3 and 25 mm glucose + 20% FCS). The empty dishes were tapped against the edge of a table and washed into the centrifuge tube with 5 ml (80% DMEM with 25 mmNaHCO3 and 25 mm glucose + 20% FCS). After centrifugation for 5 min at 70 × g, the cell pellets were combined in a single centrifuge tube and incubated with gentle shaking every minute for 5 min at 37 °C with 1/7 volume of 1% dispase in CMfDPBS. One volume (80% DMEM with 25 mmNaHCO3 and 25 mm glucose + 20% FCS) was added, and the suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 70 ×g.

The day of myoblast plating was defined as day 0. The myoblasts were confluent with beginning myotube formation 48 h after plating, and the medium was changed to 90% DMEM with 25 mmNaHCO3 and 25 mm glucose + 10% horse serum. Thereafter, half of the medium was changed three times per week, on day 6 with addition of 20 μm AraC and from day 9 with 10 μm AraC to prevent further proliferation of nonfused cells (14Turo K.A. Florini J. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 243: C278-C284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From day 12 to day 21, the cultures consisted mainly of well differentiated cross-striated and spontaneously contracting myotubes as judged by light and electron microscopy and by a creatine kinase activity at ∼10 units/mg protein. The dishes were placed on ice, the medium was removed by suction, and the cells washed three times at 1–2 °C with Hanks' balanced salt solution. 1000 ml of KF buffer (15Baque S. Guinovart J.J.

The homogenates were kept frozen at −80 °C until analyses. Protein content was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (16Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. The dishes were placed on ice, the medium was removed from the dishes by suction and 1000 μl of 0.4n KOH was added to each dish. After 5 min at room temperature, aliquots of the homogenates were stored frozen at −20 °C until analysis. Glycogen was determined as glucose after treatment with amyloglucosidase as described by Katz et al. (17Katz J. Rognstad R. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1976; 10: 237-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Aliquots for determination of β-dextrin limits were acidified to pH 4.8 by 1m citric acid and digested with β-amylase (9Devos P. Hers H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 99: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The β-dextrin digest were precipitated with 2 volumes of absolute ethanol for 1 h on ice, centrifuged, and washed two times with 70% ethanol. The final precipitate was hydrolyzed in 1 m HCl for 2 h at 80 °C and neutralized with 1 m NaOH. 3 ml of Ultima Gold liquid scintillation solution was added, and the radioactivity was determined in a Packard Scintillator with external counting efficiency determination. The procedure for determination of radioactivity in glycogen originating from [3H]- and [14C]glucose and3H2O was identical, but treatment with β-amylase was omitted and, for the determination of radioactivity in glycogen originating from 3H2O, two additional washing procedures with 70% ethanol were included. Homogenates in 0.4m KOH were heated on a boiling water bath for 10 min, cooled, and centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was applied on a 5-cm Dowex-50 (H+) on top of 7-cm Dowex-1 (acetate) and the columns eluted with 25 ml water. The eluate was lyophilized and dissolved in 100 μl of water and kept at −20 °C until EM analysis. Glycogen granules were negatively stained (1% uranyl acetate in water) on 200-mesh formvar and carbon-coated nickel grids previously subjected to glow discharge just before use. Electron microscopy was carried out using a Zeiss EM 900 electron microscope operated at 80 kV. The mechanism of glycogen synthesis and degradation was elucidated by the following experimental design, as illustrated in Fig. 1 A. From day 14 to day 15, cells were depleted of glycogen for 24 h. On day 15, at t = 0 h, the cell cultures were incubated under conditions favoring glycogen synthesis. Glycogen accumulation reached a maximum after ∼3 h; the first interval of glycogen accumulated occurred from 0 to 0.5 h and was carried out in the presence of [6-3H]glucose; the second interval of glycogen accumulated from 0.5 to 3 h was carried out with [U-14C]glucose. At 3 h, incubation conditions were changed so glycogen degradation was favored, i.e. low glucose and forskolin. The medium composition for the periods was as follows: depletion period, DMEM with 25 mm NaHCO3, 0 mm glucose, 10% horse serum; accumulation period, first interval, DMEM (19 mm NaHCO3, 19 mmHepes, pH 7.2, and 0.1 mm creatine), 10 mmglucose, and 1.6 μCi/ml [6-3H]glucose; second interval, DMEM (same composition as for first interval), 10 mmglucose, and 0.4 μCi/ml [U-14C]glucose; and degradation period, DMEM (same composition as for first interval, but without pyruvate), 1 mm glucose, and 10 μmforskolin. At the time points indicated in Fig. 1 B (0, 0.5, 1.5, and 3 h for the glycogen accumulation period and 3, 3.25, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, and 7 h for the degradation period) total glycogen and radioactivity in β-dextrin (for the estimation of degree of sequential synthesis/degradation, see “β-Dextrin Limit” below) and glycogen (for estimation of degree of the last-in-first-out principle, see “Calculations” below) were determined. The molecular size distribution of glycogen (for the estimation of degree of sequential synthesis/degradation) was determined at 0, 0.5, 3, 3.5, and 7 h. Recovery of the 3H radioactivity, which was incorporated in glycogen from 0 to 0.5 h, was estimated by determination of the3H content at t = 1.5 and 3 h. For14C radioactivity, incorporated in glycogen fromt = 0.5 to 3 h, recovery was determined att = 4 h in parallel dishes where the accumulation period was extended to 4 h in the absence of radioactivity fromt = 3 to 4 h. Glycogen net synthesis during the degradation period from 3 to 7 h was determined in parallel dishes, which were treated as for glycogen accumulation in two intervals as described above, but without addition of radioactive tracers. At the start of the degradation period att = 3 h, 500 μCi of3H2O/ml of medium was added and 3H radioactivity in glycogen was determined at t = 4, 5, 6, and 7 h. The β-dextrin limit was determined as the amount (or radioactivity) of glycogen remaining after treatment with β-amylase divided by the total amount (or radioactivity) of glycogen. In glycogen particles with full sized A-chains, i.e. 13 glucosyl units, the size of the β-dextrin relative to the untreated glycogen molecule is (2(t − 1) − 1)/(2t − 1), where t is the number of glucosyl tiers, 2(t − 1) − 1 is the number of glucosyl chains left in glycogen (β-dextrin) after treatment with β-amylase and 2t − 1 is the total number of glucosyl chains in glycogen (2Menléndez-Hevia E. Waddell T.G. Shelton E.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18Manners D.J. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. 1957; 12: 262-298Google Scholar) resulting in a β-dextrin limit of 48–50% for 5 ≤ t ≤ 12. For A-chains shorter than 13 glucosyl residues, the β-dextrin limit was calculated as (13(2(t − 1) − 1)/(13(2(t − 1) − 1) +n(2t − 1)), where n is the number of glucosyl residues in the A-chains. During glycogen synthesis, the β-dextrin limit will range from 65 to 50%, assuming a minimum A-chain length of 7 glucosyl residues, and during degradation the range will be from 50 to 76%, assuming a minimum A-chain length of 4 glucosyl residues. If all full sized glycogen particles behave similarly during degradation, i.e. a fully simultaneous degradation pattern, it follows from the definition of the β-dextrin limit that the relative amount of glycogen at a given time point can be estimated as the β-dextrin limit in the full sized particles divided by the β-dextrin limit at that time point: glycogent= β-dextrin limitt = 0/β-dextrin limitt. The accumulation and degradation of both labeled and total glycogen could be described by monoexponential equations (see “Results,” Figs. 1 and 2, and Table I).Table IKinetics of glycogen accumulation and degradationGlycspanGlyct= 0Glyct→ ∞Glycmaxk accuk degh−1h−1Glycogen accumulation0.944 ± 0.0450.166 ± 0.0231.109 ± 0.0370.81 ± 0.10Glycogen degradation0.913 ± 0.0160.095 ± 0.0181.008 ± 0.0111.39 ± 0.14Values are means ± S.E.

To quantify the degree of last-in-first-out, the value of the following expression was calculated for the time intervals where release of tracer is estimated to take place if 100% degree of order is assumed (cf. Fig. 1 A, Table II).fraction of tracer released from labeled glycogen−fraction of glycogen degraded1−fraction of glycogen degradedEquation 3 The degree of order ranges from zero to one, corresponding to completely random and fully ordered degradation of glycogen, respectively.Table IICalculated degree of last-in-first-outInterval (isotope)Estimated degradation interval if 100% degree of last-in-first-outEstimated fraction of tracer released from glycogen in the degradation intervalEstimated fraction of glycogen degraded in the time intervalDegree of last-in-first-outFirst (3H)3.75 ± 0.07–5.38 ± 0.430.33 ± 0.050.29 ± 0.02−0.03 ± 0.03Second (14C)3–3.75 ± 0.070.71 ± 0.050.57 ± 0.060.36 ± 0.03*Values are means ± S.E.

The degree of last-in-first-out was calculated as described under “Calculations.” Statistical test for significance was performed by Student’st test. *, p < 0.001. The degradation time intervals where release of tracer is estimated to take place if 100% degree of order is assumed were calculated from Equations 1 and 2, and the release of 3H or 14C label was calculated from Equation 2 using these time points and the degradation constants for 3H and 14C, respectively. The glycogen pool in the muscle cells was labeled over two intervals during the accumulation of glycogen, first with [6-3H]glucose for 0.5 h and then from 0.5 to 3 h with [U-14C]glucose (cf. Fig.1 A and “Experimental Design”). The subsequent release of radioactivity during glycogen degradation was intended to show the degree to which the synthesis and degradation of glycogen followed the last-in-first-out-principle. Prior to the initiation of glycogen accumulation, the myotubes contained 47 ± 8 nmol of glycogen/mg of protein. Glycogen accumulation was initiated by changing the medium to 10 mm glucose (3H-labeled from t = 0–0.5 h and14C-labeled from 0.5–3 h) and after 0.5 and 3 h, glycogen content had increased to 151 ± 18 and 310 ± 35 nmol/mg of protein (n = 8), respectively. The glycogen accumulation for the 3-h interval could be well fitted by the monoexponential Equation 1 (see “Calculations”), with a rate constant k accu of 0.81 ± 0.10 h−1, Glycspan-accu = 0.944 ± 0.045, Glyct = 0 = 0.166 ± 0.023, and Glycmax = 1.109 ± 0.037 (TableI). Glycogen degradation was followed for 4 h and initiated by a medium containing 1 mm glucose and 10 μmforskolin, which is supposed to activate glycogen phosphorylase (15Baque S. Guinovart J.J. Gómez-Foix A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 2594-2598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Analogous to the synthesis, the degradation process could be well approximated by the monoexponential Equation 2 (see “Calculations”) with a rate constant k deg of 1.39 ± 0.14 h−1, Glycspan-deg = 0.913 ± 0.016, Glyct→∞ = 0.095 ± 0.018, and Glycmax = 1.008 ± 0.011 (Table I). Interpretation of the results would be complicated if significant glycogen recycling took place during the experiments. Glycogen degradation during the accumulation period and glycogen synthesis during the degradation period was therefore estimated. In the [14C]glycogen accumulation interval (from 0.5 to 3 h), the 3H content of glycogen decreased linearly by 4 ± 1% h−1 (p < 0.001). The14C content in glycogen decreased by 6 ± 6% h−1 (p > 0.05), as determined in parallel experiments where the glycogen accumulation period was extended to 4 h with unlabeled glucose in the period from 3 to 4 h. Recycling of radioactive tracer may therefore have occurred. However, this is probably not a problem because released labeled glucose 1-phosphate and glucose would be diluted by the much higher concentration of labeled precursors (10 mm, see “Experimental Procedures”). During the degradation period (from 4 to 7 h), net glycogen synthesis was determined as incorporation of 3H2O into glycogen. The synthesis rate of glycogen synthesis under degradation conditions was extremely low and nonsignificant. Because the 3H label was introduced first during the glycogen synthesis, it could be expected to be released last and vice versa for the 14C label if the last-in-first-out principle applies and if all glycogen molecules are in the same phase of degradation. The data show that there was no significant release of 3H-labeled glucose from glycogen during the first 15 min of the degradation period, during which 25% of the glucosyl units was released (Fig. 2). Thereafter, however, significant 3H release took place, although at a lower rate than 14C release as reflected in the increase in the 3H/14C ratio from 3 to 7 h (Fig. 3). With the ratio normalized to 1 at t = 3 h, it increased linearly to ∼7 at t = 7 h. The release of [14C]glucose started immediately upon establishing degradation conditions and followed first order kinetics, as did the total glycogen pool, but the rate constant was ∼40% higher (Fig.2). The degree to which the last-in-first-out principle applies to glycogen synthesis and degradation in myotubes was calculated as described under “Calculations” and is shown in TableII. The time interval in which all14C or 3H was expected to be released if a strict last-in-first-out principle applied was calculated from the time cause of isotope incorporation in glycogen as described under “Calculations” and is given in Table II. The estimated release of isotope in these intervals allowed calculation of the degree of last-in-first-out to 0.03 ± 0.03 (mean ± S.E. (n = 8)) for 3H-labeled glycogen and 0.36 ± 0.03 (mean ± S.E. (n = 8)) for14C-labeled glycogen (p < 0.001), respectively. These results indicate a completely random degradation of the first synthesized (3H-labeled) glycogen and a partially ordered degradation of the last synthesized (14C-labeled) glycogen. To check for possible procedural effects, the order in which the two tracers were administered was reversed, although with no effect (data not shown). The mean diameter of glycogen particles increased from 24.9 ± 1.8 nm (mean ± S.E. (n = 3)) at t = 0 h to 28.1 ± 1.1 nm at t = 0.5 h, remained constant during accumulation from t = 0.5–3 h (29.4 ± 1.6 nm att = 3 h) and during degradation fromt = 3–3.5 h (29.1 ± 1.1 nm at t= 3.5 h), and then declined to the initial value at the end of the degradation period (24.4 ± 0.1 nm at t = 7 h) (Fig. 4). β-Dextrin limits during the glycogen accumulation period (Fig. 5 A) were determined to 61 ± 6%, 50 ± 4%, and 48 ± 1% (mean ± S.E. (n = 8)) at t = 0.5, 1.5, and 3 h, respectively. This means that the glycogen molecules must have a mean A-chain length of ∼13 glucosyl residues at 1.5 and 3 h. From 3 to 7 h, the β-dextrin limit increased from approximately 48 to 67%, suggesting a decrease in the average A-chain length. The [3H]β-dextrin limit (Fig. 5 B) increased gradually in the accumulation period from ∼0.61 at t= 0.5 h to 0.75 at t = 3 h. This increase was not the result of release of outer, tritium-labeled glucosyl residues because the decrease of 3H in β-dextrin and in total glycogen from 0.5 to 3 h occurred at the same rate (results not shown). In the degradation period, the [3H]β-dextrin limit increased linearly to ∼0.87, but the S.E. of the values betweent = 3–7 h were big. In th"

Hepatic ATP metabolism can be monitored by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can measure tissue oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), deoxyhemoglobin (Hb), and cytochrome oxidase (Cyt Ox), which reflect ATP production. In this study, hepatic oxygenation parameters have been correlated with ATP metabolism under graded hypoxia. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent laparotomy for liver exposure. NIRS probes and an NMR coil were placed on the liver and the animal was positioned in the NMR magnet. Graded hypoxia was achieved by a stepwise reduction of the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) from 15 to 4%. Recovery between the hypoxic periods was achieved using 30% oxygen. Hepatic tissue oxygenation parameters were measured continuously by NIRS; 31P-NMR spectra obtained at 1 min intervals from energy metabolites and intracellular pH were calculated. All the hypoxic grades produced an immediate reduction in HbO2 with a simultaneous increase in Hb. Cyt Ox was reduced significantly only with FiO2 of </= 10%. 31P-NMR spectra showed a significant decrease in cellular beta nucleoside triphosphate (beta-NTP) only with FiO2 of </= 10%. Significant correlation was seen between beta-NTP and HbO2 (r=0.85), Hb (r=-0.74), and Cyt Ox (r=0.81). Cyt Ox was reduced with intracellular hypoxia and correlated temporally with the reduction of cellular beta-NTP, and therefore could be used as an index for the changes in beta-NTP with hypoxia."

IκB kinases reactive oxygen species cellular inhibitor of apoptosis mouse embryo fibroblast(s) dithiothreitol reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction lactate dehydrogenase A wide range of signals, many of which are thought to be related to cellular stress, induce expression of early response genes through the NF-κB family of transcription factors (1Baldwin Jr., A.S.

In resting cells, NF-κB is retained in cytoplasm in its inactive form by interaction with one of a number of inhibitory molecules including IκBα, IκBβ, IκBε, p105, and p100. Activation of the NF-κB signaling cascade results in a complete degradation of IκB or carboxyl-terminal partial degradation of the p105 and p100 precursors, allowing nuclear translocation of the NF-κB complexes. Activated NF-κB binds to specific DNA sequences in target genes, designated as κB elements, and regulates transcription of genes mediating inflammation, carcinogenesis, and pro- or antiapoptotic reactions. IκBα is the most abundant inhibitory protein for NF-κB (5Israel A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 129-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of signal-induced IκBα degradation involve phosphorylation of two serine residues, Ser32 and Ser36. This phosphorylation leads to polyubiquitination of two specific lysines on IκBα (Lys21 and Lys22) by an SCF-β-TrCP complex and its degradation by the 26 S proteasome (6Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation is accomplished by a specific IκB kinase (IKK)1 complex containing two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a structural component named NEMO/IKKγ/IKKAP (3Karin M. Delhase M.

IKKα and IKKβ share 50% sequence homology. Both proteins contain an amino-terminal kinase domain, a carboxyl-terminal region with a leucine zipper, and a helix-loop-helix domain. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that both IKKα and IKKβ are capable of phosphorylating IκBα on Ser32 and Ser36, but IKKβ is more potent in IκBα phosphorylation induced by proinflammatory stimuli. Recent studies by several groups indicate the existence of an additional IKK-like kinase complex in T cells, named IKKi/ε, which shares 27% homology with IKKα and IKKβ and possibly mediates NF-κB-activating kinase signaling and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/protein kinase Cε-induced Ser36phosphorylation of IκBα and thus NF-κB activation (7Peters R.T.

Increasing evidence indicates that NF-κB is either a pro- or antiapoptotic transcription factor regulating a variety of apoptotic responses (12Aggarwal B.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). NF-κB is activated in response to several proapoptotic stimuli including oxidative stress, cytotoxic drugs, and ionizing radiation (13Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp.

Consistent with this notion, the gene encoding Fas ligand (FasL) has been shown to be transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB in response to T-cell activation signals and to chemotherapeutic agents (15Kasibhatla S.

The evidence that NF-κB is also an antiapoptotic transcription factor is mainly provided by gene knockout studies of NF-κB family members and IKK kinase subunits (17Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T.

Male mice with an inactivated X-linked gene encoding IKKγ/NEMO, an essential modulator of the IKK complex for NF-κB activation, die at midgestation due to a massive cortical and medulla lymphocyte apoptosis in the thymus in addition to degeneration of the liver (20Rudolph D.

Thus, in certain situations, NF-κB is proapoptotic, but in alternative situations and cell types, NF-κB inhibits apoptosis and contributes to cell proliferation or transformation. Therefore, cell type and inducing stimuli appear to determine whether NF-κB is a causal or secondary event in apoptosis. Apoptosis is a process in which cell death is initiated and completed in an orderly fashion through the activation of various apoptotic pathways (22Green D.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 23Green D.R. Beere H.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 28-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, in cases of severe injury, cells may instead undergo necrosis, a passive death resulting in cellular lysis (23Green D.R. Beere H.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 28-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Most apoptotic cells are characterized by unique morphological features, such as membrane blebbing, cell shrinking, cytosolic and nuclear condensation, and breakdown of chromosomal DNA. In contrast, cells dying by necrosis are characterized by cellular edema and loss of cell membrane integrity. Depending on the involvement of caspases or reactive oxygen species, cell death can be apoptotic, necrotic, or both (24Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). In fact, under many circumstances, different death pathways can co-exist in the same cell and are switched on by specific stimuli. A number of studies have revealed that when a cell dies by a typical apoptotic process, usually a late phase necrosis also occurs (25Dive C. Gregory C.D. Phipps D.J. Evans D.L. Milner A.E.

The objective of the present investigation was to clarify the involvement of NF-κB in Cr(VI)-induced cell death and to determine if NF-κB plays a protective or promoting role in cell death triggered by Cr(VI). The human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was cultured in keratinocyte basal medium (Sigma) supplemented with 30 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract and 5 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) derived from wild-type mice and IKKβ gene knockout mice were a gift from Dr. Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cr(VI) was purchased from Aldrich. The luciferase assay kit was from Promega (Madison, WI). All antibodies against NF-κB family members, IKKβ, procaspase-3, Bcl-xl, and Myc tag were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) or Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. ECL Western blotting detection reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. pCR-FLAG-IKKβ and pCR-FLAG-IKKβ-KM (K44A) were gifts from Dr. Hiroyasu Nakano (Juntendo University, Japan). pcDNA3-myc-IAP1 was provided by Dr. John C. Reed (The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). pEGFPluc vector was purchased fromCLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). BEAS-2B cells were plated in six-well tissue culture plates at 5 × 105 cells/well for 2 days. The cells were transfected with a control vector (pCR3) or indicated expression vectors along with a 2× κB-dependent luciferase reporter construct using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as previously described (34Peters M.T. Brigham K.L. King G.A. Meyrick B.O. Gao X. Stecenko A.A. Exp. Lung Res. 1999; 25: 183-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Single clones of BEAS-2B cells, stably transfected with the control vector (pCR3), wild-type IKKβ, or IKKβ-KM, and luciferase reporter genes, were isolated in 700 μg/ml G418 for 3 weeks and tested by Western blotting and luciferase activity assay for expression of the transfected genes. Stably transfected cells were maintained in regular culture medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml G418. To minimize possible clone variations during the course of selection, several independently derived cell lines expressing each transfected vector with similar expression levels were pooled together for the experiments described below. For nuclear protein extraction, cells were harvested and resuspended in hypotonic buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as previously described (35Chen F. Demers L.M. Vallyathan V. Lu Y. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35591-35595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in buffer A for 10 min on ice and then vortexed for 10 s. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 s and were resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 25% glycerol, 0.4m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice. The supernatants containing nuclear proteins were collected after centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min and stored at −70 °C. For EMSA, 4 μg of nuclear extract were mixed with the32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a κB sequence (5′-CAACGGCAGGGGAATTCCCCTCTCCTT-3′). The reaction solution was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and electrophoresed on a native 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE buffer for 2–3 h. The DNA-binding proteins were visualized by autoradiography. The IKK activity assay was performed by the method reported by Geleziunas et al. (36Geleziunas R. Ferrell S. Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Grant M. Connelly M.A. Hambor J.E. Marcu K.B. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5157-5165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, transfected BEAS-2B cells, seeded at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml and cultured for 2 days, were treated with indicated agents and lysed in a lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. After centrifugation of the lysate at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was incubated with anti-IKKβ antibody H-470 or anti-FLAG antibody with rotation for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 20 μl of Protein A-agarose and incubation at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. The immunoprecipitate was collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g and washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmMnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmNaF, and 1 mm DTT. To monitor the kinase reaction, the immunoprecipitate was incubated in 20 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of GST-IκBα (1–54) (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), which was then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to autoradiography. Logarithmically growing cells stably transfected with indicated expressing vectors were harvested by typsinization. Cell suspensions were seeded into six-well tissue culture plates with a concentration of 103 cells/well. After allowing cells to adhere for 12 h, the cells were treated with various concentrations of Cr(VI) for an additional 12 h. After the treatment, cells were washed and incubated for 1 week in tissue culture medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. At the end of culture, the cell colonies were washed and fixed by the addition of water/methanol (1:1, v/v) containing crystal violet (1 mg/ml) and counted under a microscope. The clonogenic survival rate was calculated based on the number of colonies that grew and the number of cells plated into each well. For the analysis of cell death, stably co-transfected cells with the pEGFPluc and/or other indicated vectors were cultured in six-well tissue culture plates for 48 h before the experiments. The percentage of green cells was determined by fluorescence microscopy. Five independent counts in each experiment were used to determine a mean and S.D. The Genefilter membrane (gf2l1) from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL), which covers 3,965 genes, was used for mRNA expression profiling following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA extracted from transfected cells was incubated with 2 μg of oligo(dT); 1.5 μl of reverse transcriptase; 20 mm dATP, dGTP, and dTTP; and 100 μCi of [32P]dCTP in 30 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water for 90 min at 37 °C. After purification through a Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column, labeled probe was mixed with prehybridization solution and incubated with Genefilter membranes overnight at 42 °C. To minimize possible variations among individual membranes, the same membrane was stripped and rehybridized with a second probe after the first round of hybridization. To verify the microarray data, some of the differentially regulated genes in the transfected cells, wild-type or IKKβ−/− MEF, were analyzed by RT-PCR. The primers used for RT-PCR were designed by using Primer3 software (available on the World Wide Web at www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi) and indicated in Table I.Table ISequences of PCR primers used for the RT-PCR experimentsmRNAGenBank™ IDPrimers (left/right)1-aThe maximum mismatch numbers of human (H) versus mouse (M) primers is 2 nucleotides.RegionProduct sizebpXDHH: XM_0540715′-CCGCACAGATATTGTCATGG-3′H: 3606–3803198M: NM_0117235′-CTGAACTCAATGGGGATGCT-3′M: 3556–3753eNOS1-bEndothelial nitric-oxide synthase.H: XM_0546475′-GACCCTCACCGCTACAACAT-3′H: 1105–1303199M: NM_0087135′-GCTCATTCTCCAGGTGCTTC-3′M: 1109–1307POH1H: XM_0025325′-TTTGCTATGCCACAGTCAGG-3′H: 416–607192M: NM_0215265′-CAAGGCTTCAAAGCTCTGCT-3′M: 450–641cIAP2H:U458785′-CAATTGGGAACCGAAGGATA-3′H: 1087–12821965′-ACTTGCAAGCTGCTCAGGAT-3′cIAP2M:U889085′-TTCCCTCAGACCCTGTGAAC-3′M: 718–9161995′-GCAAAGCAGGCCACTCTATC-3′cIAP1H:U458795′-CAAAACTGCCTCCCAAAGAC-3′H: 243–446204M:U889095′-GCACGAGCAAGACTCCTTTC-3′M: 784–9877 S RNAH:V004775′-CTACTCGGGAGGCTGAGACA-3′H: 31–171141M:X042115′-CCTCCTTAGGCAACCTGGTG-3′M: 15–159145The temperatures for reverse transcription were 50 °C for 30 min and 94 °C for 2 min.

Whole cell extracts were mixed with 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10 or 16% gels. The resolved proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting was performed using antibodies against IKKβ, FLAG, Myc tag, Bcl-xl, caspase-3, and anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates. IKKβ has been considered as the major IκBα kinase in response to a variety of stimuli (3Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 5Israel A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 129-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To determine whether overexpression of a kinase-mutated form of IKKβ (IKKβ-KM) can lead to inhibition of NF-κB, we characterized BEAS-2B cell clones stably expressing either wild-type IKKβ or IKKβ-KM along with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter construct. BEAS-2B cells transfected with the empty vector pCR3 were employed as a control. To exclude the potential problem associated with overexpression, we selected clones with a range of expression of the exogenous proteins relative to the endogenous IKKβ and identified clones with comparable levels of expression of wild-type IKKβ and IKKβ-KM. We first confirmed the previously observed inhibition of NF-κB in the cells expressing IKKβ-KM (37Chen F. Lu Y. Zhang Z. Vallyathan V. Ding M. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11414-11419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The nuclear proteins were prepared from the transfected clones in the absence or presence of various doses of Cr(VI) for 1 h and subjected to EMSA. Fig.1A shows that NF-κB DNA binding activity in the cells transfected with a control vector or wild-type IKKβ could be induced by Cr(VI) in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, no or very marginal induction of NF-κB DNA binding activity by Cr(VI) could be observed in the cells transfected with IKKβ-KM (Fig. 1A,lanes 6–10, upper panel). The same nuclear extracts were also analyzed for the Sp1 DNA binding activity. As shown in Fig. 1A, overexpression of IKKβ-KM did not alter the Sp1 DNA binding activity in the cellular response to Cr(VI) (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). To verify that the inhibition of NF-κB was a result of the functional disruption of IKK in cells expressing IKKβ-KM, we examined IKK kinase activity in these cells in the absence or presence of Cr(VI). Cell extracts prepared at a 40-min time point after treatment with Cr(VI) were immunoprecipitated using IKKβ antiserum and subjected to an immune complex kinase assay using GST-IκBα (amino acids 1–54) as the substrate. As depicted in Fig. 1B, Cr(VI) stimulated IKK kinase activity in the cells transfected with a control vector or wild-type IKKβ (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–3and lanes 7–9, top panel). Only marginal IKK kinase activity was induced by Cr(VI) in the cells stably expressing IKKβ-KM (Fig. 1B, lanes 4–6, top panel). Essentially equal amounts of IKKβ proteins were present in the extracts from the cells transfected with vector, IKKβ-KM, or IKKβ as verified by immunoblot using anti-FLAG and anti-IKKβ antibodies (Fig. 1B,middle and bottom panels). Since the transfected IKKβ and IKKβ-KM were consistently of the expected size in the immunoblot using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1C,third panel), it seemed unlikely that the IKKβ-KM coding region had undergone mutation or rearrangement during plasmid amplification or integration into genomic DNA. Thus, these results suggest that the IKK kinase activity is indeed inhibited in the cells expressing a kinase-mutated form of IKKβ, IKKβ-KM. Evidence that cells lacking NF-κB activity undergo apoptosis suggests that NF-κB activation provides protection against apoptotic signals (17Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). The above data show that NF-κB activation in response to Cr(VI) is defective in the cells expressing IKKβ-KM. We next determined whether NF-κB inhibition by expression of IKKβ-KM sensitized cells to apoptosis in response to Cr(VI). To our surprise, Cr(VI) (5 μm) treatment for 12 h induced a necrotic-like, rather then apoptotic, cell death of IKKβ-KM cells. Morphologic analysis of phase-contrast images of cells indicates that only a few control vector-transfected cells or wild-type IKKβ-expressing cells exhibited partial cell shrinkage and condensation after the treatment with Cr(VI) (Fig. 2, F andG). In contrast, after the same treatment, IKKβ-KM-expressing cells manifested cell blebbing, swelling, and loss of membrane integrity, characteristics similar to those seen in cells undergoing necrosis (Fig. 2H). The role of IKKβ and NF-κB in controlling Cr(VI)-induced cytotoxicity was further investigated genetically using a knockout MEF cell line lacking IKKβ subunits. A dramatic loss of cell viability in response to Cr(VI) was observed in IKKβ−/− MEF (Fig.2J) but not in wild-type MEF (Fig. 2I). Thus, these results excluded the potential artifacts associated with the use of dominant negative IKKβ kinase mutant in overexpression experiments (Fig. 2H). To further assess the cytotoxic effect of Cr(VI) on the cells in which NF-κB was inhibited due to overexpression of IKKβ-KM or deficiency of the IKKβ gene, IKKβ-expressing cells, IKKβ-KM-expressing cells, wild-type MEF, and IKKβ−/− MEF were treated with increasing concentrations of Cr(VI). Cytotoxicity was determined by both LDH release analysis and clonogenic survival assay. As indicated in Fig. 3, A and B, compared with their wild-type counterparts, a substantial increase of LDH release was observed in IKKβ-KM cells (Fig. 3A) and in IKKβ−/− cells (Fig. 3B) in response to various doses of Cr(VI). Consistent with this observation, the clonogenic survival assay indicated that exposure to increasing amounts of Cr(VI) inhibited clonogenic survival in IKKβ-KM cells and IKKβ−/− MEF more effectively than in the cells expressing wild-type IKKβ or wild-type MEF (Fig. 3C). Fig.3D depicts a representative clonogenic survival experiment. It has been demonstrated that the bcl-x gene is a transcriptional target of NF-κB in both mouse and human cells (35Chen F. Demers L.M.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Enhanced NF-κB activity has been correlated with the up-regulated expression of Bcl-xl, an important antiapoptotic protein that can stabilize mitochondrial membranes and prevent the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (39Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 41Reed J.C. Jurgensmeier J.M. Matsuyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for the increased vulnerability of IKKβ-KM-expressing cells in response to Cr(VI) is that these cells may lack sufficient anti-death proteins, such as Bcl-xl, due to the impairment of NF-κB signaling. Decreased expression of Bcl-xl can cause either apoptosis due to the increase of mitochondrial membrane permeability or necrosis due to the collapse of fragile mitochondria (42Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Waguri S. Uchiyama Y. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2045-2050PubMed Google Scholar). However, gene expression profiling showed no difference of bcl-xl gene expression between IKKβ and IKKβ-KM expressing cells (data not shown). Unexpectedly, spontaneous cleavage of Bcl-xl protein was observed in IKKβ-KM-expressing cells but n"

Initially, endonuclease cleavage occurs 8–10 nt downstream of the mature 3′ end, which itself lies at the end of a stem-loop-forming inverted repeat (IR) sequence. This intermediate product is then trimmed by a 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity. Although the initial endonucleolytic cleavage by definition generates two products, the downstream product of atpB pre-mRNA endonucleolytic processing cannot be detected, even transiently. This product thus appears to be highly unstable, and it can be hypothesized that specific mechanisms exist to prevent its accumulation. In experiments described here, the atpB 3′ maturation site was placed upstream of reporter genes in vivo. Constructs containing both the IR and endonuclease cleavage site (ECS) did not accumulate the reporter gene mRNA, whereas constructs containing only the IR did accumulate the reporter mRNA. The ECS alone gave an intermediate result, suggesting that the IR and ECS act synergistically. Additional secondary structures were used to test whether 5′ → 3′ and/or 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activities mediated degradation. Because these structures did not prevent degradation, rapid endonucleolytic cleavages most likely trigger RNA destruction after ECS cleavage. On the other hand, fragments resulting from cleavage within the endogenousatpB mRNA could occasionally be detected as antisense transcripts of the adjacent reporter genes.

RNA sequence and secondary structure, along with ribonucleases and a variety of accessory factors, are used to achieve these goals. Built into this process is the necessity to recognize nonfunctional RNAs and eliminate them; destruction of nonsense codon-containing mRNAs is a good example of the complexity of such surveillance mechanisms (reviewed in Ref. 1Czaplinski K. Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Gonzalez C.I. Peltz S.W. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has focused on 5′ end and 3′ end maturation of chloroplast mRNAs, using both vascular plants and the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as models. In this respect, chloroplast transcripts have mostly prokaryotic features such as the lack of a trimethylguanosine 5′ cap, a 3′ stem-loop-forming inverted repeat (IR)1structure, and they are destabilized by polyadenylation (reviewed in Refs. 2Monde R.A.

Processing of chloroplast mRNAs, with rare exceptions, depends on nucleus-encoded proteins, several of which have been identified genetically through screens for plants orChlamydomonas strains unable to carry out photosynthesis. The phenotypes suggest that defects in intercistronic processing of polycistronic transcripts (4Felder S. Meierhoff K. Sane A.P. Meurer J. Driemel C. Plucken H. Klaff P. Stein B. Bechtold N.

Plant J. 1998; 13: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) can cause RNA instability and/or translational defects. Also, we have previously shown that correctly 3′ end processed mRNA is translated preferentially in Chlamydomonas chloroplasts (9Rott R. Levy H. Drager R.G. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4605-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, 5′ and 3′ end maturation are essential steps in chloroplast gene expression. Biogenesis of the Chlamydomonas chloroplast atpBmRNA is particularly well characterized. The atpB gene contains a somewhat unusual promoter, with essential elements included in the 5′ UTR (10De Klein U. Camp J.D. Bogorad L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3453-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Following transcription, two 5′ ends can be found in the mature mRNA (11Blowers A.D. Ellmore G.S. Klein U. Bogorad L. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 1059-1070PubMed Google Scholar), a situation also found for many other chloroplast transcripts and presumed or proven to result from a primary transcript undergoing partial endonucleolytic cleavage. The region spanning from 10–89 nt downstream of the atpB stop codon contains an IR sequence predicted to form an AU-rich stem-loop structure, and the mature 3′ end is found 3–4 nt downstream of the IR (12Stern D.B. Radwanski E.R. Kindle K.L. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 285-297PubMed Google Scholar, 13Stern D.B. Kindle K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2277-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Deletions that destabilize this structure cause RNA instability (12Stern D.B. Radwanski E.R. Kindle K.L. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 285-297PubMed Google Scholar); however the sequence can be functionally replaced by an IR from spinach chloroplasts (13Stern D.B. Kindle K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2277-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or by a polyguanosine tract, which forms a tertiary structure impervious to either 5′ → 3′ or 3′ → 5′ exonucleases (8Drager R.G. Girard-Bascou J. Choquet Y. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Plant J. 1998; 13: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Drager R.G. Zeidler M. Simpson C.L. Stern D.B. RNA. 1996; 2: 652-663PubMed Google Scholar). Both in vitro and in vivo approaches have shown that chloroplast IR sequences do not efficiently terminate transcription, and those tested include Chlamydomonas atpB(13Stern D.B. Kindle K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2277-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Rott R. Liveanu V. Drager R.G. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This implies that post-transcriptional 3′ end maturation is required. We have previously shown that atpB mRNA undergoes a two-step maturation process (13Stern D.B. Kindle K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2277-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the first step, endonuclease cleavage occurs at three consecutive positions 8–10 nt downstream of the mature 3′ ends (Fig. 1A). This cleavage is rapid, and in vitro can be detected within seconds of adding an artificial transcript to a Chlamydomonas chloroplast stromal extract. The second step is 3′ → 5′ exonucleolytic trimming, a slower step that requires about 15 min in vitro. Surprisingly, however, the distal product of endonucleolytic cleavage could not be detected in vitro, even when theatpB endonuclease cleavage site (ECS) was placed between two stem-loops or when the artificial transcript was labeled at its 3′ end. This suggested that some mechanism rapidly degraded the downstream cleavage product, unlike the unprocessed pre-mRNA or maturedatpB fragment, both of which were relatively stable in thein vitro system. The atpB mRNA itself is quite stable in vivo, with a half-life estimated at 2–10 h depending on growth conditions (16Salvador M.L. Klein U. Bogorad L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1556-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here, we show that cleavage at theatpB ECS potentiates rapid degradation of the downstream fragment in vivo, even if it is a coding region or flanked by protective RNA structures. Our data suggest the activity is an endonuclease that acts as part of a targeted RNA recycling mechanism. The strains used in this study were wild-type P17 (12Stern D.B. Radwanski E.R. Kindle K.L. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 285-297PubMed Google Scholar), which is derived from CC373 (17Shepherd H.S. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1353-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the atpB deletion mutant used as a transformation recipient. Cells were grown in TAP medium (18Harris E.H. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 700-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under constant fluorescent light. The uidA constructs shown in Fig. 2 were based on pDG2 (19Sakamoto W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This plasmid contains the petD promoter and 5′ UTR translationally fused to the uidA coding region andrbcL 3′ UTR, and the chimeric gene is inserted into the large inverted repeat of the chloroplast genome downstream of theatpB gene (11Blowers A.D. Ellmore G.S. Klein U. Bogorad L. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 1059-1070PubMed Google Scholar). We previously engineered a BglII site into the petD 5′ UTR at position +25 relative to the mature RNA 5′ end, which lengthens the transcript by 6 nt and is present in pDG2 (19Sakamoto W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The BglII site was used as an insertion point for the various atpB fragments to make thepetD-uidA and petD-aadA (DG and DA) constructs. The 242-bp ECS fragment, which contains the distal half of the atpB 3′ stem-loop, the ECS, and downstream sequences, was amplified from the WT atpB gene using primers NFIR.3 (loop of IR) and DBS5 (see primers listed in TableI). This PCR product was cloned into the ddT-tailed EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK+ and released with BglII (in primer NFIR.3) and XbaI (in primer DBS5). This BglII-XbaI fragment was ligated into the unique BglII site (+25) of pDG2 after bluntingXbaI and the 3′ half of petD BglII, generating the ECS-DG plasmid.Table IOligonucleotide primers used in this studyPrimersOligonucleotide sequenceatpBstartGCCCCAAGGCATTCATADBS1CAAAATTCTCCACCAGCDBS4CCAGAACAAGCATTCTACTTAGTAGGDBS4anti (P3 in Fig. 2C)CCTACTAAGTAGAATGCTTGTTCTGGDBS5XbaI-CTGTATCTCGTGGACGAClar005 (T7 underlined)TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGGCTCGTGAAGCGGTTATCGlar006 (T3 underlined)AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGGTTATTTGCCAACTACCTTANFIR.3BglII-ATTTGGACACCATTAAGTTGNFIR.5BglII-CAGGTAGCCGAAGGGGP1 (ah-rbc13′-atpB)CCCCTTCCCCTTCGGGACGTCCP2 (ah-atpBecs)GGGAAAGGTGCAACTACGTGGGWS11SmaI-ACTGACATATTTATTTATCCGTTAAWS13BglII-TTTTTTAGCATGTAAACATTAGAAATAC8901CTAAAATAATCTGTCCGG8906GACAAGCTTTACATCCC Open table in a new tab The WT atpB 3′ UTR was amplified with primers DBS4 and DBS5, yielding the same 341-bp fragment previously used for in vitro mRNA maturation studies (13Stern D.B. Kindle K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2277-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The insert was cloned and then released with XhoI andXbaI, blunted, and inserted in the blunted BglII site of the petD 5′ UTR. Both orientations were obtained to make plasmids +IRECS-DG and −IRECS-DG. This 679-bp insert was amplified from the plasmid containing tandem Chlamydomonas atpB and spinachpetD 3′ UTRs (Δ8Δ50; Ref. 13Stern D.B. Kindle K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2277-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with primers DBS4 and 8901. The fragment was inserted into the pDG2 BglII site to generate the IRECSIR-DG plasmid. Finally, the 151-bp IR fragment was made from the source plasmid atpBΔ21, a derivative of the WTatpB gene in which 6 nt of the distal stem of theatpB 3′ stem-loop has been deleted, as well as downstream sequences (12Stern D.B. Radwanski E.R. Kindle K.L. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 285-297PubMed Google Scholar). At the site of the deletion a BglII site was inserted. The atpBΔ21 Chlamydomonas strain accumulates a discrete atpB transcript of the wild-type size, indicating that the short deletion does not significantly comprise RNA stability (13Stern D.B. Kindle K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2277-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The IR insert was amplified from atpBΔ21 with primers DBS4 (XhoI) and 8906 (HindIII), inserted into pBluescript, excised with XhoI and BglII (the Δ21 3′ deletion end point), and inserted into the petD 5′ UTR BglII site after blunting XhoI and the 5′ half of petD BglII, creating plasmid IR-DG. The pDAAD (20Rott R. Drager R.G. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 676-683PubMed Google Scholar)-based constructs shown in Fig. 3 were made by releasing thepetD promoter and 5′ UTR fragments from ECS-DG and +IRECS-DG with XhoI (upstream of promoter) and SmaI (3′ to the translation start) and using them to replace the equivalentXhoI-SmaI fragments of pDAAD, generating plasmids ECS-DA and +IRECS-DA. WT and CC373 were referenced above. Strain Δ8 has been described previously (12Stern D.B. Radwanski E.R. Kindle K.L. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 285-297PubMed Google Scholar) and has a complete atpB transcription unit and a 2-kb deletion beginning 87 bp downstream of the IR. At the site of this deletion aBglII site was inserted, and this was used to create the Δ8pG strain. The plasmid was digested at its unique BglII site, and annealed oligonucleotides carrying a G18 motif, a flanking EcoRI RFLP to determine orientation, and sticky ends compatible with BglII (14Drager R.G. Zeidler M. Simpson C.L. Stern D.B. RNA. 1996; 2: 652-663PubMed Google Scholar) were ligated into it. For IRECSpG, an atpB 3′ UTR-pG-containing fragment was amplified from plasmid atpBΔ8pG using primers DBS4 and 8901 and inserted into a ddT-tailed EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK+. This fragment was released with XhoI (in primer DBS4) and BglII (in primer 8901) and inserted into the BglII site of pDG2, after blunting XhoI and the 3′ petD BglII site, creating plasmid IRECSpGDG. RNA was isolated from 10 ml of cells as previously described (21Drager R.G. Higgs D.C. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Plant J. 1999; 19: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For RNA filter hybridizations, 10 μg of total RNA was fractionated in 1.2% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gels, transferred to Hybond-N (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and cross-linked by UV irradiation. Double-stranded DNA probes were labeled by random priming (22Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar), and filters were prehybridized and hybridized according to Church and Gilbert (23Church G. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar). Double-stranded probes were the following: foruidA, an internal EcoRV fragment; forpetD, the complete 362-bp 5′ UTR was amplified using primers WS13 and WS11; for aadA, the coding region was excised from patpX-AAD (24Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4083-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar); and for atpB, primers DBS1 and atpBstart were used to amplify the 5′ UTR, because this region is not deleted in CC373. For strand-specific RNA probes, filter hybridizations were performed using the Zeta Probe protocol from Bio-Rad (www.bio-rad.com) with the following modifications. Prehybridization and hybridization were at 65 °C for a minimum of 3 h and 8 h, respectively. All probes were made by linearizing DNA templates and transcribing with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (25Stern D.B. Gruissem W. Cell. 1987; 51: 1145-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The following probes were used. For uidA the template was pBGEV (26Higgs D.C. Colbert J.T. Plant Cell Rep. 1993; 12: 445-452PubMed Google Scholar). Antisense transcripts were made with T7 followingHindIII digestion, and sense transcripts were made with T3 following EcoRI digestion. For aadA the template was amplified from patpXAAD with primers lar005 (beginning with a T7 promoter; sense transcripts) and lar006 (beginning with a T3 promoter; antisense transcripts). For probes spanning the region downstream of the atpB 3′ UTR, primers NFIR.3 and 8901 (minus added restriction sites) were modified to be preceded with T7 and T3 promoters, respectively. T3 transcription produced an antisense transcript, and T7 transcription a sense transcript. All RNA hybridizations were analyzed using the Storm system (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). For primer extension, 2 ng of primer DBS4anti (P3 in Fig. 2C) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase and mixed with 20 μg of Chlamydomonas RNA in a final volume of 8 μl The reaction also contained 0.7 μl of 10 mm dNTPs and 0.7 μl of 10× reaction buffer (10× buffer is 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 60 mm MgCl2, 500 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol). The reaction was incubated for 5 min at 75 °C and 5 min at 50 °C, 4.5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) were added, and incubation was continued for 15 min at 50 °C. 5 μl of sequencing dye was then added, and samples were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Degradation of downstream sequences is associated with ECS cleavage (Fig. 1A) and may be associated with multiple mechanisms (Fig. 1B). Mutagenesis of the ECS showed, however, that cleavage occurred in vivoeven after multiple mutations were introduced (27Rott R. Liveanu V. Drager R.G. Higgs D.C. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 676-686Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This suggested that the ECS alone did not determine the processing site. To determine which RNA element(s) might be required for ECS downstream product destabilization, a series of reporter gene constructs were assembled and introduced into Chlamydomonas chloroplasts by biolistic transformation, as shown in Fig.2A. These strains contained a chimeric petD promoter/5′ UTR-uidA(β-glucuronidase) coding region-rbcL 3′ UTR reporter gene, which was located downstream of and in opposite orientation to the endogenous atpB gene. This insertion site has been used for numerous uidA gene fusions in the past (10De Klein U. Camp J.D. Bogorad L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3453-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11Blowers A.D. Ellmore G.S. Klein U. Bogorad L. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 1059-1070PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sakamoto W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and does not affect the expression of atpB, which is used as the selectable marker for transformation of the nonphotosynthetic recipient strain CC373 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The reference strain, DG2, has the structure shown at thetop of Fig. 2A. Five additional strains were created that have insertions at the +25 position relative to the matureuidA mRNA 5′ end. We have previously shown that deletions up to +25 do not affect transcription rates (19Sakamoto W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and that small mutations or a polyguanosine insertion within the +1–25 region do not decrease petD RNA levels (21Drager R.G. Higgs D.C. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Plant J. 1999; 19: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28Higgs D.C. Shapiro R.S. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8479-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, the sequences around this position are not important for petDmRNA 5′ end maturation (28Higgs D.C. Shapiro R.S. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8479-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), although any insertion into this site translationally inactivates the message for unknown reasons. For this reason, analyses were restricted to RNA accumulation. The +25 insertions are shown symbolically in Fig. 2A and include the following sequences: ECS, a 242-bp fragment, which lacks one stem of the atpB 3′ IR, and includes the ECS; +IRECS, a 341-bp fragment, which includes the full 3′ IR and ECS in the sense orientation relative to uidA; −IRECS, which includes the 3′ IR and ECS in the antisense orientation relative to uidA; IRECSIR, a 679-bp fragment, which contains the atpB 3′ IR and ECS, with a second IR derived from the spinach chloroplastpetD gene immediately downstream; and IR, a 151-bp fragment, which has the nearly complete atpB 3′ IR but lacks the ECS. Homoplasmic transformants were obtained, and uidA mRNA was examined with strand-specific probes, with petD mRNA as a loading control. Fig. 2B (top panel) shows results with a probe that detects sense uidA mRNA. As expected, no hybridization occurs with RNA from wild-type cells or CC373, the transformation recipient. On the other hand, a transcript of 2.5 kb accumulates in DG2; this mRNA has a 5′ end at position +1 in the petD 5′ UTR (19Sakamoto W. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and terminates in the rbcL3′ UTR at a stem-loop structure (29Dron M. Rahire M. Rochaix J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 775-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Among the five newly created strains, three accumulated a sense uidA transcript. Of these, the lowest accumulation relative to petD was in ECS, with higher amounts in −IRECS and IR. The sizes of the chimericuidA transcripts in these strains are slightly larger than in DG2, commensurate with the sizes of insertions at +25. We thus infer that these transcripts have been correctly 5′ end-processed. On the other hand, neither +IRECS nor IRECSIR accumulated senseuidA mRNA. These are also the only two strains that have both the atpB IR and ECS at +25. Because the IR is not responsible for transcription termination, for example it is present in strain IR (see also Refs. 13Stern D.B. Kindle K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2277-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and 15Rott R. Liveanu V. Drager R.G. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), it can be concluded that the IR-ECS combination prevents accumulation of uidA mRNA through RNA degradation. We would explain accumulation in strain ECS by inefficient cleavage in the absence of the IR; uncleaved RNA accumulates, whereas RNAs that are cleaved undergo downstream degradation. The bottom panel of Fig. 2B shows results with a probe designed to detect antisense uidA mRNA. Surprisingly, hybridization was detected in four strains, most prominently in +IRECS and most weakly in ECS (the band marked with anasterisk is an rRNA hybridization artifact). Based on their sizes, these RNAs had 5′ ends in or near the intergenic region betweenatpB and the 3′ end of the uidA cassette and 3′ ends at the IR sequences inserted at the petD +25 position (see Fig. 5 and “Discussion”). We have already shown that theatpB 3′ IR can stabilize RNAs when it is in the antisense orientation (20Rott R. Drager R.G. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 676-683PubMed Google Scholar). To map the 5′ ends, we selected +IRECS and IRECSIR and used primer extension with RNA from untransformed cells as a negative control. Three primers were tested, as shown at thetop of Fig. 2C (P1, P2, P3). Using P1, no transformant-specific products were detected; however using P2, high molecular weight products were seen for +IRECS and IRECSIR but not for the WT control (data not shown). To map the end precisely, we used the 26-nt primer P3, which anneals upstream of the atpB stop codon. 5′ Ends mapping 6 nt upstream of the primer were found in both transformants, whereas this product was not seen in the control. The additional bands probably result from abortive extension of the abundant endogenous atpB transcript, which extends 1.9 kb upstream and accumulates in all strains. The mapped 5′ ends in +IRECS and IRECSIR lie 72 nt upstream of the atpB stop codon and may represent a normal cleavage site during atpB mRNA degradation. We hypothesize that they accumulate in these transformants due to their stabilization at the 3′ end by IR structures and for unknown reasons, perhaps structural, are not subject to cleavage at the ECS. Note that the IRECSIR antisense transcript is slightly longer (Fig. 2B), in agreement with the fact that it has apetD 5′ UTR insert 338 bp longer than that of +IRECS, which would be included at the 3′ end of the antisense transcript. In wild-type cells no antisense transcript accumulated, based on primer extension. Assuming that the same atpB-internal cleavage occurs in wild-type cells, a short transcript would be generated also flanked by a 3′ IR. However, this hypothetical transcript would only be 168 nt and might be unstable and/or subject to loss during RNA isolation. The lack of an antisense transcript in strain IR, on the other hand, was unexpected given its accumulation in the other IR-containing strains. We note that the +25 insertion in IR is not the entire stem-loop, as it lacks the last 6 of 20 nt in the second stem (12Stern D.B. Radwanski E.R. Kindle K.L. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 285-297PubMed Google Scholar). Given its AT-richness, the antisense IR sequence may form too weak of a secondary structure to stabilize the uidAantisense transcript. To confirm that the results shown in Fig. 2 were not due to a peculiarity of the reporter gene chosen, certain constructs were replicated using theaadA coding region instead of uidA. aadA is a commonly used selectable marker gene in Chlamydomonaschloroplasts and has also been used to study RNA ciselements (8Drager R.G. Girard-Bascou J. Choquet Y. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Plant J. 1998; 13: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30Zerges W. Rochaix J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5268-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows results from the reference strain, DAAD (petD-aadA), and two derivatives, ECS-DA and +IRECS-DA. These are in every way analogous to the uidA-based constructs DG2, ECS-DG, and +IRECS-DG, respectively. When a dsDNA probe recognizing the aadA coding region was used, a 1.5-kb transcript accumulated in DAAD, as expected. This is the chimeric petD-aadA-rbcLmessage. A 1.7-kb species accumulated in ECS-DA, and a 3.4-kb transcript accumulated in +IRECS-DA. To differentiate between sense and antisense transcripts, a strand-specific probe was used, which only detected antisense aadA mRNAs (bottom panel). This identified the 3.4-kb species but not the 1.5-kb and 1.7-kb transcripts. Thus, a sense aadA transcript accumulates to a low level when the ECS alone is inserted at position +25, not at all when both the IR and ECS are present, and to an increased level when neither is present. On the other hand, the antisense message only accumulated when a stem-loop-forming sequence was present at position +25. These results are entirely consistent with the results foruidA constructs (except the lack of a minor antisense transcript in ECS-DA) and indicate that the reporter gene coding region did not have a significant effect on the outcome. The mechanism by which ECS cleavage potentiates downstream degradation could involve one or a combination of ribonuclease activities known to exist in Chlamydomonaschloroplasts, as shown in Fig. 1B. 5′ → 3′ Exonuclease activity (i) is known from studies of mutants in which particular chloroplast transcripts are unstable due to lack of protection of the 5′ UTR by nucleus-encoded factors and can be blocked by a polyguanosine (pG18) sequence (8Drager R.G. Girard-Bascou J. Choquet Y. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Plant J. 1998; 13: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31Nickelsen J. Fleischmann M. Boudreau E. Rahire M. Rochaix J.-D.

Hernandez N. Cell. 1989; 58: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 11Mattaj I.W. Dathan N.A. Parry H.D. Carbon P. Krol A. Cell. 1988; 55: 435-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The PSE is bound by a multisubunit complex known in human cells as SNAPC or PTF (12Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Yoon J.-B. Murphy S. Bai L. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The distal region is almost universally composed of an octamer motif (OCT) and, often, a closely spaced SPH element (14Ares M., Jr. Chung J.-S. Giglio L. Weiner A.M. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 808-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Murphy S. Pierani A. Scheidereit C. Melli M. Roeder R.G.

OCT is bound by the Oct-1 activator, and part of the mechanism for Oct-1 activation is accounted by direct contact between its DNA-binding POU domain and the SNAP-190 subunit that facilitates ternary complex formation with DNA (18Ford E. Strubin M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3528-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this protein-protein contact is mediated by a positioned nucleosome located between the distal region and PSE on the human U6 promoter (19Stunkel W. Kober I. Seifart K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4397-4405Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Zhao X. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 539-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The snRNA SPH motif was first recognized in chickenU1, U2, and U4 distal regions (21Roebuck K.A. Walker R.J. Stumph W.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4185-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,22Zamrod Z. Stumph W.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7323-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but it is now apparent that the SPH motif is present in many vertebrate snRNA-type promoters (17Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For the human U6 snRNA gene promoter, the OCT and SPH motifs contribute approximately equivalent stimulatory effects (23Kunkel G.R. Hixson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1536-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cDNA for SPH-binding factor has been cloned from Xenopus, mouse, and humans, and is called SBF, Staf (selenocysteine tRNA gene transcription activating factor), or ZNF143 (24Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Tommerup N. Vissing H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 26Adachi K. Saito H. Tanaka T. Oka T. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4846-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (referred to as SBF/Staf here). SBF/Staf contains a 7-zinc finger DBD and an apparently unique 15-amino acid repeat that is present in four copies in the amino-terminal region (24Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For Xenopus Staf, the snRNA activation region, functional for both pol II and pol III snRNA-like promoters, has been localized to a segment of 18 amino acids positioned in the primary structure between the 15-amino acid repeats and the DBD (28Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, SBF/Staf also stimulated transcription from an mRNA-type pol II promoter. The mRNA activation activity was demonstrated using a synthetic tk/CAT promoter and localized to the 15-amino acid repeat region of SBF/Staf (28Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Hence, SBF/Staf has the unusual property of distinct activation domains that target either snRNA-type or mRNA-type promoters, and therefore illustrates another example of multifunctionality among activators. However, a genuine mRNA promoter activated by SBF/Staf was not identified initially. In the course of this work, a report was published that described the presence of SPH elements in the promoter of the mouse cytosolic chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide 1α subunit gene, and demonstrated transcriptional stimulation by SBF/Staf (29Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28641-28648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here we show a second example of a bona fide mRNA promoter that employs SBF/Staf, the human interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) gene. Plasmids TA H5/H1 (containing ∼770 bp of human IRF-3 gene 5′-flanking sequence and continuing downstream to the end of intron 1) and pIRF3(−394) (a luciferase reporter vector) were supplied by Will Lowther and Paula Pitha, Johns Hopkins University Medical School (30Lowther W.J. Moore P.A. Carter K.C. Pitha P.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The IRF-35′-flanking region between −206 and −129 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) to construct pCR2/IRF3. Isolates were recovered that contained the IRF-3 insert in both orientations within the plasmid. To construct pGEM/IRF3FORW/dl-84/U6/CFREE and pGEM/IRF3REV/dl-84/U6/CFREE, inserts in both orientations were excised from pCR2/IRF3 byHindIII/XbaI digestion and ligation into the same restriction sites of pGEM/dl-84/U6/CFREE (23Kunkel G.R. Hixson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1536-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To construct pIRF3(−394)/SPHMUT and pIRF3(−394)/OCTMUT, the SPH and OCT motifs of pIRF3(−394) were mutated using the GeneEditor Site-directed Mutagenesis System (Promega) with the following mutagenic oligonucleotides (mutations in lowercase type): SPHMUT, 5′-GCTCAATTTGCATGTGACGCggaagactctCCTCcGGCCGGAAACCCAAAAAAGGGC; OCTMUT, 5′-GAACGCTGGGTGCACGCTCAAggTaCcTGTGACGCTCCCAGCATGCC. The SPHMUT mutant was designed to convert the SPH site to a binding site for yeast GAL4 protein. The double site mutant plasmid pIRF3(−394)/SPHMUT/OCTMUT was constructed by recloning the SPHMUT insert into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega), and using the GeneEditor system to substitute the same OCTMUT mutation as delineated above. Mammalian expression constructs were initially subcloned into the pCG-GAL4-(1–94) vector (31Das G. Hinkley C.S. Herr W. Nature. 1995; 374: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using PCR to amplify desired segments of SBF/Staf, but then recloned into pCI-neo (Promega), since the latter vector resulted in higher expression levels in other transfection experiments. All inserts for recloning were amplified by PCR using PfuTurbo polymerase (Stratagene) and contained added EcoRI and SalI sites for insertion into pCI-neo. GAL4/SBF fusion proteins expressed from these vectors contained a 5-amino acid linker (LPGSS) between GAL4-(1–94) and the SBF/Staf coding region that arose from the pCG-GAL4 vector. The radiolabeled IRF-3 probe used for protein-DNA binding assays was prepared by PCR using a kinased,32P-end labeled IRF-3–206 primer (5′-GGAACGCTGGGTGCACGC), an unlabeled, complementary strand CIRF-3–129 primer (5′-CCTATGCCCTTTTTTGGG), and pCR2/IRF3 plasmid DNA. DNA-protein complex formation, competition with oligonucleotides and electrophoresis on nondenaturing gels were carried out as described previously (32Danzeiser D.A. Urso O. Kunkel G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4670-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Preparation of a HeLa cell S100 extract is described in Ref. 33Kunkel G.R. Danzeiser D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14250-14258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, andin vitro transcription/translation to produce recombinant SBF-(76–626) was carried out as before (27Rincon J.C. Engler S.K. Hargrove B.W. Kunkel G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4846-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The same −206/−129IRF-3 probe was used for DNase I footprinting following methods described previously (32Danzeiser D.A. Urso O. Kunkel G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4670-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), with bacterially expressed SBF-(76–626) protein (27Rincon J.C. Engler S.K. Hargrove B.W. Kunkel G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4846-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Human 293 cells were transfected in 100-mm dishes with 10 μg of U6/CFREE reporter plasmid plus 10 μg of pGEM/cβ3 using the calcium phosphate method, and total RNA was isolated and analyzed by primer extension as described previously, except that a longer primer was used to detect β-tubulin transcripts (5′-AGGTGCACGATCTCCCTCATG-3′) (34Goomer R.S. Kunkel G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4903-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Relative band intensities were quantitated using a STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Transfection experiments shown in Fig. 4 used 60-mm dishes of human 293 cells containing 1.0 × 106 cells seeded 24 h prior to transfection. One μg of pIRF3 reporter DNA and 0.5 μg of pSV-βgal (Promega) were introduced using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturers protocol. After 48 h, cells were harvested by scraping, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and total lysates prepared in 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 0.2% Triton X-100. Luciferase and β-galactosidase (Galacto-Light Plus assay system (Tropix)) activities of cell lysates were measured with a microplate luminometer (Packard Lumicount). Transfection experiments shown in Fig.5 used 24-well microtiter plates containing 1.0 × 105human 293 cells per well seeded 24 h prior to transfection. Using the calcium phosphate protocol, each sample was transfected with 100 ng of pIRF3 reporter plasmid, 50 ng of pSV-βgal, and 1 ng of pCI/GAL4/SBF expression plasmid. Cells were harvested after 36 h, and lysates assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase.Figure 5Expression of the amino-terminal human SBF/Staf mRNA activation domain can enhance transcription from theIRF-3/SPHMUT promoter in transfected cells. Human 293 cells in 24-well microtiter plates were transfected by the calcium phosphate protocol with a pIRF3(−394) or pIRF3/SPHMUT reporter plasmid DNA, a pCI/GAL4/SBF expression plasmid DNA, and pSV-βgal plasmid DNA. 36 h post-transfection, cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined using chemiluminescent assays. After background subtraction, luciferase/β-galactosidase ratios were compared with the wt promoter (pIRF3(−394)). Theheight of each bar represents the average value from four separate transfections, and the height from the midpoint of the error bar shows one standard deviation from the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Stably transfected 293 cells containing either pIRF3(−394)(wt) or pIRF3(−394)/SPHMUT were prepared using the calcium phosphate protocol with a combination of the appropriate IRF-3 plasmid plus pCI-neo (Promega) as a neomycin resistance marker. After selection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 0.4 mg/ml G418 sulfate (Invitrogen), individual clones were isolated and maintained in the same medium. 100-mm dishes of cells were treated with formaldehyde, harvested, lysed, and sonicated as described by the Farnham laboratory (35Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Per 50 μl of sonicated chromatin were added 50 μl of 2% Triton X-100, 200 mm NaCl, and 20 μl of Ultralink-Protein A beads (Pierce), with incubation at 4 °C for 4 h. After pelleting the beads, the supernatant was immunoselected with the addition of 20 μg of sonicated, salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), 2 μg of affinity-selected anti-SBF antibodies (27Rincon J.C. Engler S.K. Hargrove B.W. Kunkel G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4846-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and 20 μl of Ultralink-Protein A beads, followed by incubation at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed and immunoprecipitates eluted as described in Ref. 36Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar. Cross-links were reversed in the immunoprecipitated samples by incubation at 65 °C for 6 h, and DNA samples were purified using the Wizard PCR Preps System (Promega). IRF-3 promoter DNA from exogenous genes was detected by PCR, using the IRF-3–206 oligonucleotide and GLprimer2 (Promega), an oligonucleotide that is complementary to the luciferase coding region. EndogenousU6-1 genomic sequences were detected using two primer sets. For the near upstream region (−307 to −190), HU6-307 (5′-GCAAAACGCACCACGTGACG-3′) and CHU6-190 (5′-CTCTCTAACAGCCTTGTATC-3′) were employed. For the far upstream region (−1880 to −1760), HU61-1880 (5′-ACCTCTGGCTCAAAGTAACACATG-3′) and CHU61-1760 (5′-TTAGAACAGGTAGGGCTGGTGGTT-3′) were used for PCR amplification. The first round of amplication used 20 cycles, and was followed with a second round of 10 cycles in the presence of 5 μCi of [32P]dGTP. The PCR signal was not saturated using these conditions. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 20% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The 5′-flanking sequence of the human IRF-3gene contains a putative SPH element centered at position −163 and a consensus octamer motif centered at position −181 (Fig.1). Close linkage of OCT and SPH motifs is a hallmark of the enhancer-like regions of many vertebrate snRNA gene promoters, whether they are transcribed by RNA polymerase II or III (16Kunkel G.R. Cheung T.C. Miyake J.H. Urso O. McNamara-Schroeder K.J. Stumph W.E. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 59-72PubMed Google Scholar, 17Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The presence of snRNA gene SPH elements in mRNA gene promoters has been described recently in only a single example, the mouse cytosolic chaperonin containing t-complex subunit a gene (29Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28641-28648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To examine whether the IRF-3 SPH and OCT sites could be bound by factors in vitro, electrophoretic mobility gel shift, and DNase I footprinting assays were performed using a radiolabeled DNA fragment containing the sequence from −206 to −129. Several complexes were formed on the IRF-3 fragment using a HeLa cell S100 extract (Fig. 2 A). The major complexes were composed of octamer-binding factor, presumably Oct-1, and SBF/Staf, since they were specifically competed by the addition of excess unlabeled consensus octamer oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 A,lanes 2–4) or human U6 SPH oligonucleotide (Fig.2 A, lanes 5–7). Recombinant SBF/Staf expressed in Escherichia coli bound the same IRF-3 promoter fragment, and binding specificity was demonstrated by competition withU6 SPH, but not OCT, oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, sequence-specific binding to the IRF-3 gene promoter by either recombinant Oct-1 POU domain, or recombinant SBF/Staf-(76–626) was shown by DNase I footprinting (Fig.2 C). The downstream portion of the IRF-3 SPH element was not protected in the footprint (Fig. 2 C,lanes 4 and 5), similar to the footprint of recombinant SBF/Staf on the human U6 SPH element (27Rincon J.C. Engler S.K. Hargrove B.W. Kunkel G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4846-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This lack of protection may reflect the poor fit of the 3′-end of the IRF-3SPH element to the consensus (Fig. 1), and is consistent with the documented flexibility of DNA binding by Staf zinc fingers, notably zinc finger 1 (37Schaub M. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24241-24249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Figure 2SBF/Staf and Oct-1 bind to the humanIRF-3 promoter region. A, binding of SBF/Staf and Oct-1 in crude HeLa cell extract. Approximately 3 fmol of radiolabeled IRF-3 DNA fragment containing the sequence from −206 to −129 were incubated with HeLa S100 extract and electrophoresed on a 4% native, polyacrylamide gel. Complexes delineated as “OCT” or “SBF/Staf” were identified by competition with excess double-stranded oligonucleotides added with the radiolabeled probe in the following amounts: lanes 2–4, 30-, 300- and 3000-fold molar excess, respectively, of consensus octamer motif from the human U6 distal region (OCTCON); lanes 5–7, 30-, 300-, and 3000-fold molar excess, respectively, of human U6 SPH motif. B, binding of recombinant human SBF-(76–626), expressed by in vitro transcription/translation, was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Approximately 3 fmol of radiolabeled IRF-3-(−206/−129) DNA probe were mixed with translation extract programmed with pET/hSBF-(76–626) DNA in the absence of competitor DNA (lane 2), or with unlabeled consensus OCT double-stranded oligonucleotide (30- and 300-fold molar excess in lanes 3 and 4, respectively), or with unlabeled U6 SPH double-stranded oligonucleotide (30- and 300-fold molar excess in lanes 5 and 6, respectively).C, binding of IRF-3-(−206/−129) radiolabeled DNA by recombinant hSBF-(76–626) or Oct-1 POU domain detected by DNase I footprinting. Lanes 1 and 2 show protection by ∼40 and 100 ng, respectively, of Oct-1 POU domain protein, andlanes 3–5 show protection after addition of ∼10, 50, and 100 ng, respectively, of hSBF-(76–626) protein. The sample electrophoresed in lane 6 contained no added transcription factor prior to DNase treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) After demonstrating that the IRF-3 SPH and OCT sites were potential targets for factor binding in vitro, their capacity for transcriptional activation was tested. Initially, the IRF-3 SPH + OCT segment (−206/−129) was fused to the basal human U6 snRNA gene promoter (dl-84/U6/CFREE) in both orientations, and tested for activity in transfected human 293 cells. In either orientation the IRF-3SPH + OCT segment stimulated snRNA promoter transcription approximately 6–9-fold (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and3). This stimulatory activity was comparable to that exerted by the U6 SPH motif (Fig. 3, lane 4), but ∼20% of that provided by the U6 SPH + OCT distal region (Fig. 3,lane 5). Previously we have shown that the U6 SPH and OCT elements were approximately equally effective in a such a transfection assay, and their combination was only slightly greater than additive (23Kunkel G.R. Hixson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1536-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Next, the roles of the SPH and OCT elements were tested in the IRF-3promoter. Clustered point mutations were introduced to disrupt each element separately (SPHMUT or OCTMUT), and together in the same promoter (SPHMUT/OCTMUT). IRF-3 promoter activities were determined by quantitation of luciferase reporter gene levels in transfected human 293 cells. Disruption of the SPH element resulted in a decrease of promoter activity to ∼25% of wt (Fig.4, SPHMUT). In contrast, mutation of OCT caused a small, but reproducible increase in activity (Fig. 4, OCTMUT). When both elements were mutated,IRF-3 promoter activity was reduced to the same extent as for the SPHMUT construct. The data shown in Fig. 4 are from transfection experiments using 1 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid (in 60-mm dishes), but similar results were obtained when either 0.5 or 2 μg of reporter plasmid were employed (data not shown). Furthermore,IRF-3/SPHMUT promoter activity was similarly reduced to ∼25% of wt in transfected HeLa cells (data not shown). Reduced transcription from the SPHMUT promoter demonstrated the importance of the DNA sequence from −170 to −161, but did not prove a role for SBF/Staf in the IRF-3promoter in vivo. In order to examine the activation of this promoter by SBF/Staf, cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding GAL4 DBD/SBF fusion proteins and an IRF-3promoter/luciferase reporter plasmid containing a GAL4-binding site. The SPHMUT/IRF-3 reporter plasmid had been designed to convert the SPH element to a GAL4 element. Two GAL4 DBD/SBF fusion plasmids were constructed. One, pCI/GAL4/SBF-(1–140), contained the amino-terminal sequence of SBF/Staf, a region that includes 4 imperfect 15-amino acid repeats previously shown to activate a synthetic thymidine kinase reporter gene in injected Xenopus oocytes or transfectedDrosophila cells (28Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A second fusion protein, expressed from pCI/GAL4/SBF-(136–223), contained a region of SBF/Staf reported to activate snRNA gene promoters (28Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 2G. R. Kunkel, unpublished results. Expression of GAL4/SBF-(1–140) stimulated transcription from the SPHMUT/IRF-3 promoter ∼2-fold, whereas the GAL4/SBF-(136–223) fusion protein had no effect (Fig. 5). Furthermore, expression of the GAL4 DBD-(1–94) alone did not significantly stimulate expression from the SPHMUT promoter (results not shown). In these experiments the effect of the SPH mutation was somewhat more severe than shown previously (13% of wt in Fig. 5 versus27% of wt in Fig. 4), possibly because smaller numbers of cells and plasmid DNAs were used for the transfection assays. Both GAL4 fusion proteins and the GAL4 DBD protein were expressed at similar levels in transfected 293 cells as determined on Western blots using antibody directed against the GAL4 DBD (data not shown). The GAL4/SBF-(1–140) fusion protein was unable to reconstitute full, wt IRF-3activity to the SPHMUT promoter, but the stimulatory activity was significant compared with the control GAL4/SBF-(136–223) and GAL4 DBD proteins. To further investigate the binding of SBF/Staf to the IRF-3promoter, chromatin immunoprecipitation was employed with stably transfected cell lines containing either the wt IRF-3 gene promoter or the SPHMUT promoter. Individual clones were selected for resistance to G418 due to co-transfection with pCI-neo plasmid DNA, and two that showed relatively high luciferase activities were investigated further. Luciferase expression from the SPHMUT cell line was ∼9% of that from the wt IRF-3 promoter cells (data not shown). Furthermore, using genomic DNA and quantitative PCR conditions, it was estimated that an approximately equal number of copies of exogenous wt or SPHMUT promoter DNAs were incorporated into the stably transformed cell lines (data not shown). Sheared chromatin from formaldehyde-treated cells was immunoselected with affinity purified anti-SBF/Staf antibodies or preimmune antiserum.IRF-3 promoter sequence was detected at significantly higher levels by PCR in the DNA from anti-SBF/Staf immunoselected chromatin compared with that selected by the preimmune antibodies (Fig.6 A, compare lanes 2and 3), using primers spanning the region from −206 (IRF-3–206 primer) to just downstream of the luciferase translation start site (GLprimer2; +97 from the putative IRF-3 transcription start site). In contrast, the PCR signals from anti-SBF/Staf and preimmune antibodies were the same background level from SPHMUT chromatin samples (Fig. 6 A, compare lanes 5 and 6). The average of three independent PCR assays resulted in a 9.8-fold higher band intensity for wt versus SPHMUT anti-SBF/Staf selected DNA when normalized to the signals from total, unselected DNA (i.e. Fig. 6 A, compare lanes 2 and5). As a control, the selection of human U6-1gene promoter DNA by the anti-SBF/Staf antibodies was examined. Primers spanning the SPH element (−307 to −190) amplified DNA in the anti-SBF/Staf immunoselected chromatin, but not after preimmune antibody selection (Fig. 6 B, compare lanes 4 and5). However, no DNA from a far upstream region of the humanU6-1 gene (−1880 to −1760) was selected by either anti-SBF/Staf or preimmune antibodies (Fig. 6 B, lanes 9 and 10). Therefore, similar to the endogenousU6-1 gene, SBF/Staf is bound to the IRF-3 gene promoter in transfected cells, and SBF/Staf promoter occupancy is correlated with increased transcription activity of the wt compared with SPHMUT templates in transfected cells. In this report, we demonstrate that the transcriptional activator, SBF/Staf, first characterized for its role at snRNA gene promoters, is an important stimulatory factor for the human IRF-3 gene promoter. The SPH element at −160 is bound by recombinant SBF/Staf or the endogenous protein in HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 2). Disruption of the SPH element causes decreased promoter activity that is partially restored by co-expression of the SBF/Staf mRNA activation domain which is directed to the mutant promoter (Fig. 5). Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation results show that SBF/Staf binds to the wt IRF-3 promoter in transfected cells (Fig. 6). The potential for SBF/Staf activation at mRNA gene promoters was demonstrated first using a synthetic tk/CAT promoter containing multiple activator-binding sites (28Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). With this report, at least two bona fide mammalian mRNA promoters have been shown to contain functional SPH elements that are binding sites for this activator. Recently, the mouse chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide 1 α-subunit gene promoter was found to contain two SPH elements at positions −70 and −20 (29Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. J.

At present, the limited dataset of mRNA promoters containing SPH elements makes it impossible to determine whether correlations exist between other features of these promoters. Whereas the mouse chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide 1 α-subunit promoter is apparently TATA-less, the tk promoter contains a documented TATA box (38McKnight S.L. Kingsbury R. Science. 1982; 217: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The human IRF-3 promoter does not contain a canonical TATA box at the normal location, but it is not known whether a functional TATA element is present (30Lowther W.J. Moore P.A. Carter K.C. Pitha P.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Both the aforementioned synthetic tk/CAT promoter and mouse chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide 1 α-subunit promoter contain multiple SBF/Staf-binding sites. We found only one SPH site in the −206/−129 region of the human IRF-3 promoter, but cannot rule out the possibility of other sites outside this region. However, our chromatin immunoprecipitation results with the SPHMUT promoter do not indicate any strong SBF/Staf-binding sites in a more proximal location of this promoter. It is not known what other transcription factors operate at the humanIRF-3 promoter. We noticed a consensus octamer motif just upstream of the SPH motif at a position of approximately −180 (Fig.1), and showed that this site was bound by Oct protein or recombinant Oct-1 POU domain in vitro (Fig. 2, A andC). However, in contrast to the SPHMUT mutation, disruption of the octamer motif (OCTMUT) resulted in only a minimal effect on theIRF-3 promoter (Fig. 4). In fact, expression from the OCTMUT promoter was reproducibly higher, suggesting that a negative regulatory element was disrupted. Presently, it is not known whether Oct protein binds to this site in vivo, although this could be examined using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Indeed, a possible USF site overlaps the consensus octamer element, and could occlude Oct binding (30Lowther W.J. Moore P.A. Carter K.C. Pitha P.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Other possible transcription factor-binding sites have been identified within the proximal 210 bp of the IRF-3 promoter, but none have been verified experimentally (30Lowther W.J. Moore P.A. Carter K.C. Pitha P.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A previous report did not identify a difference in IRF-3promoter activity when the region containing the SPH element (−195 to −127) was deleted (30Lowther W.J. Moore P.A. Carter K.C. Pitha P.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is not clear why our results are apparently in contradiction. However, it is possible that this region contains both positive (e.g. SPH) and negative regulatory elements that counteract each other. Alternatively, the previous investigators used a different cell line for their transfection experiments (2FTGH cells), that could express a different repertoire of factors that bind to the IRF-3 promoter. We found similar results with both human 293 and HeLa cells. In co-transfection experiments, expression of a GAL4 DBD/SBF-(1–140) fusion protein partially restored IRF-3 promoter activity to the SPHMUT template that contained a single GAL4-binding site (Fig. 5). However, even when larger amounts of this expression plasmid were added, wt promoter activity was not attained (results not shown). Possibly, to regain wt activity, multiple GAL4-binding sites would be necessary in this synthetic system. Alternatively, a larger segment of SBF/Staf containing multiple activation domains might be necessary for efficient IRF-3 promoter transcription complex assembly. Nevertheless, our results indicate that the amino-terminal portion of SBF/Staf, containing the 15-amino acid repeats, can function as an activation domain for the IRF-3 gene promoter, and corroborate previous results using Xenopus Staf and the synthetic tk/CAT promoter (28Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Future work will delineate the mechanisms by which SBF/Staf uses two separate domains to activate mRNA versus snRNA gene promoters.

The chemokine receptor CCR4 is preferentially expressed on the surface of Th2 lymphocytes polarised in vitro. However, CCR4 is found on the surface of a significant proportion of circulating memory T lymphocytes, some of which are capable of producing the Th1-associated cytokine interferon γ. To investigate the function of CCR4 on guinea pig (gp) T lymphocytes, we identified the open-reading frame of gpCCR4, which encodes a 361-amino acid protein with 88 and 81% amino acid identity to human and murine CCR4 sequences, respectively. Cells transfected with gpCCR4 migrated toward the human and murine orthologues of the CCR4 ligands, macrophage-derived chemokine and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine. Surface expression of CCR4, using an anti-human CCR4 monoclonal antibody, 10E4, was detected on ∼12% of guinea pig peripheral blood T helper cells, and CCR4+ guinea pig thymocytes were detected in low numbers. However, CCR4+ T helper cells constituted ∼9% of the T lymphocyte population within the normal guinea pig lung and 52% of the guinea pig bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which is consistent with a role for CCR4 in T lymphocyte development and trafficking through normal tissues. Subsequent analysis of chimeric chemokine receptors indicated that 10E4, a functional inhibitor of gpCCR4 responses, recognized the amino terminus of CCR4.

Zlotnik A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar). Chemokines can be divided into four subfamilies dependent upon the position of their amino-terminal cysteine residues; the two main chemokine groups are the CXCL and the CCL subfamilies (12Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3306) Google Scholar), which signal via CXCR and CCR receptors belonging to the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily (13Murphy P.M.

The differential expression of chemokine receptors on the surface of leukocytes contributes to the selective recruitment of cells to specific sites, and, consequently, these receptors may provide useful targets for therapeutic intervention in the modulation of inflammatory disorders. Studies of T lymphocytes polarized in vitro have shown that Th1 cells preferentially express CCR5 and CXCR3 whereas Th2 cells preferentially express CCR3, CCR4, and CCR8 (15Bonecchi R. Bianchi G. Bordignon P.P. D'Ambrosio D. Lang R. Borsatti A. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Gray P.A. Mantovani A. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar, 16Sallusto F.

However, recent data have shown that CCR4 is highly expressed on a significant proportion of circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes, and this receptor can be coexpressed with both CXCR3 and CCR5 (18Andrew D.P. Ruffing N. Kim C.H. Miao W. Heath H., Li, Y. Murphy K. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Wu L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition, some of the CCR4+ memory T lymphocytes are also capable of producing interferon γ (18Andrew D.P. Ruffing N. Kim C.H. Miao W. Heath H., Li, Y. Murphy K. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Wu L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Campbell et al. (19Campbell J.J. Haraldsen G. Pan J. Rottman J. Qin S. Ponath P. Andrew D.P. Warnke R. Ruffing N.

Vestergaard et al. (20Vestergaard C. Yoneyama H. Murai M. Nakamura K. Tamaki K. Terashima Y. Imai T. Yoshie O. Irimura T. Mizutani H. Matsushima K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) further demonstrated that the NC/Nga strain of mice, capable of developing atopic dermatitis-like lesions when not maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions, showed increased TARC expression within these lesions. Together these data suggest that CCR4 and its ligands play a role in the specific recruitment of T lymphocytes to sites of cutaneous inflammation. Evidence exists suggesting that CCR4 plays a role in T lymphocyte migration during allergic lung inflammation in vivo, however, this role remains controversial. Murine models of pulmonary inflammation have demonstrated that blockade of the CCR4 ligands MDC and TARC significantly reduced lung inflammation (21Gonzalo J.A. Pan Y. Lloyd C.M. Jia G.Q., Yu, G.

Tian J. Martinez-A C. Coyle A.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.-C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, CCR4-deficient mice showed no significant difference in predisposition to allergic lung inflammation compared with wild-type mice (24Chvatchko Y. Hoogewerf A.J. Meyer A. Alouani S. Juillard P. Buser R. Conquet F. Proudfoot A.E. Wells T.N. Power C.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1755-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) perhaps supporting the existence of an additional MDC receptor as other researchers have proposed (25Struyf S. Proost P. Sozzani S. Mantovani A. Wuyts A., De Clercq E. Schols D. Van Damme J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2672-2675PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, examination of chemokine receptor expression on T lymphocytes isolated from the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) of asthmatics or non-asthmatic individuals indicated that CCR4 is expressed at similar levels (5%) in each of these groups (26Campbell J.J. Brightling C.E. Symon F.A. Qin S. Murphy K.E. Hodge M. Andrew D.P., Wu, L. Butcher E.C. Wardlaw A.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, Panina-Bordignon et al. (27Panina-Bordignon P. Papi A. Mariani M., Di Lucia P. Casoni G. Bellettato C. Buonsanti C. Miotto D. Mapp C. Villa A. Arrigoni G. Fabbri L.M. Sinigaglia F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1357-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) demonstrated that, following allergen challenge of asthmatics, significant up-regulation of CCR4, and to a lesser extent CCR8, was observed in the lung tissue, with a corresponding up-regulation of MDC and TARC expressed on the airway epithelium. Therefore, the development of further tools to unravel the precise role of CCR4 in allergic lung inflammation is required. We have identified, characterized, and investigated the functional expression of the guinea pig homologue of CCR4 for future use in a well established in vivo model of allergic lung inflammation. A 550-bp PCR fragment of gpCCR4 was amplified by the PCR from guinea pig genomic DNA using oligonucleotides based on highly conserved regions of human and murine CCR4 sequences (28Power C.A.

Proudfoot A.E. Wells T.N. Power C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: sense gpCCR4, 5′-GCG CAT AAG CTT TTC CTG GAT GTA CTT GGT GGG CTT TT-3′; antisense gpCCR4, 5′-GCA TAT CTC GAG CAG AGT TTC TGT GGC CTG GAT GGC-3′. The resultant, partial gpCCR4 sequence was used to screen a guinea pig genomic DNA library in the vector EMBL 3 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as previously described (30Sabroe I. Conroy D.M. Gerard N.P., Li, Y. Collins P.D. Post T.W. Jose P.J. Williams T.J. Gerard C. Ponath P.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6139-6147PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, three rounds of screening were carried out to isolate a pure bacteriophage clone that hybridized with the gpCCR4 fragment probe. 1 μg of bacteriophage DNA was digested with 5 units of EcoRI for 4 h at 37 °C. DNA fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis and “shotgun” cloned into pUC19 (CLONTECH). Two fragments of ∼2.2 and 1.5 kb were cloned and sequenced using an ABI 377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The minor fragment contained 150 bp of the open reading frame (ORF) of gpCCR4, which terminated at an EcoRI site, and the major fragment contained the remaining 933 bp of the gpCCR4 ORF. Based on these sequences, a 1.1-kb single-exon ORF was identified and primers were designed to incorporate a 5′ HA tag (31Chen Y.T. Holcomb C. Moore H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6508-6512Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) plus HindIII restriction site and a 3′ XhoI restriction site to facilitate subcloning. PCR amplification of guinea pig genomic DNA yielded a complete gpCCR4 DNA sequence, which contained anEcoRI site at the predicted position. Products from duplicate PCR reactions were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands), and sequencing of both products yielded an identical consensus sequence. Primer sequences: sense, 5′-ATA TAG CGCAAG CTT GCC ACC ATG TAT CCA TAT GAT GTC CCA GAT TAT GCC AAC CCC CCT GAC ACA GCA GAC-3′; antisense, 5′-ATA TCG CGACTC GAG ATA TTA CAA CCC ATC ATG GAG ATC ATG-3′ (bases in boldface indicate restriction enzyme sequences, those underlined indicate the HA epitope-tag sequence, and those in italics indicate the Kozak sequence for enhanced translation of the gene). 20 μg of the construct gpCCR4.pcDNA3 was linearized withPvuI, and transfection of the L1.2 cells was carried out as previously described (30Sabroe I. Conroy D.M. Gerard N.P., Li, Y. Collins P.D. Post T.W. Jose P.J. Williams T.J. Gerard C. Ponath P.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6139-6147PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the L1.2 cells were electroporated in the presence of linearized DNA and subsequently cultured at 37 °C in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 48 h, geneticin (G418) was added at a final concentration of 0.8 mg/ml and the cells were then cultured for 2–3 weeks. Cells exhibiting a chemotactic response to 50 nm murine MDC using a Transwell chemotaxis assay were cloned out by limiting dilution and subsequently expanded. A panel of unconjugated anti-human CCR4 antibodies was used in this study (hybridomas 2B10 (18Andrew D.P. Ruffing N. Kim C.H. Miao W. Heath H., Li, Y. Murphy K. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Wu L. J.

Mouse IgG1 and IgG2a control antibodies (clones MOPC-21 and UPC-10, respectively) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, UK). FITC-conjugated anti-guinea pig-CD8, -Pan T cell, and -T helper subset antibodies were obtained from Serotec (Oxford, UK). Rabbit anti-mouse F(ab)′2-RPE secondary antibody was obtained from Dako (Ely, UK). 12–18 h prior to chemotaxis experiments, chemokine receptor transfectant L1.2 cells were stimulated with 10 mm n-butyric acid to stabilize receptor expression (32Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J., Wu, L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The wells of 96-well ChemoTx plates with 5-μm pore size (Receptor Technologies, Adderbury, UK) were “blocked” with RPMI + 1% BSA for 30 min at 37 °C, to reduce the nonspecific binding of chemokines to the assay plate. The assays were carried out according to manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (33Tiffany H.L. Lautens L.L. Gao J.L. Pease J. Locati M. Combadiere C. Modi W. Bonner T.I. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In studies to investigate the inhibition of chemotaxis by specific mAbs, the Transwell chemotaxis assay system was used (30Sabroe I. Conroy D.M. Gerard N.P., Li, Y. Collins P.D. Post T.W. Jose P.J. Williams T.J. Gerard C. Ponath P.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6139-6147PubMed Google Scholar). 24-well tissue culture plates were blocked as before, and cells were resuspended at a density of 1 × 106/ml in assay buffer and preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 20 μg/ml of either isotype control or the anti-CCR4 antibody 10E4, prior to placement within the Transwell. Antibodies were present throughout the duration of the assay. Chemokine dilutions were made up to 300 μl/well, and 200 μl of cell suspension was added to the Transwell and incubated at 37 °C for 5 h in the presence of 5% CO2 under humidified conditions, after which time the number of cells migrating into the lower chamber was quantified by flow cytometry (30Sabroe I. Conroy D.M. Gerard N.P., Li, Y. Collins P.D. Post T.W. Jose P.J. Williams T.J. Gerard C. Ponath P.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6139-6147PubMed Google Scholar). Stable transfectants expressing gpCCR4 or huCCR4 were butyrate-treated overnight, as above. The cells were washed in RPMI + 0.5% BSA + 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (binding buffer), counted, and resuspended in binding buffer at a density of 2 × 107cells/ml. The assay was carried out as previously described (34Sabroe I. Peck M.J. Jan Van Keulen B. Jorritsma A. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25985-25992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-huMDC and increasing concentrations of unlabeled huMDC or muMDC for 60 min at room temperature. Following centrifugation through Nyosil oil (Nye, Fairhaven, MA), cell-bound chemokine was determined using a Canberra Packard Cobra 5010-counter (Canberra Packard, Pangebourne, UK). Approximately 28% of 125I-huMDC was bound by huCCR4-transfected cells in the absence of competitor whereas 6% was bound by gpCCR4-transfected cells. Scatchard analysis of data was performed using MacLigand (35Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Naı̈ve guinea pigs were killed by CO2 inhalation, and blood was immediately taken via cardiac puncture into a 15-ml polypropylene tube containing EDTA at a final concentration of 10 mm. The blood was centrifuged at 300 × g for 20 min, and the upper platelet-rich plasma was removed and discarded. The remaining buffy coat was mixed with 9% dextran (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) in saline, and 0.9% saline, at a ratio of 3:1:4, respectively, and incubated at room temperature for 40 min. The upper leukocyte-rich layer was removed and centrifuged at 350 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 2 ml of PBS (without Ca2+/Mg2+) and overlaid onto a two-layer 70%/80% Percoll/PBS gradient and centrifuged at 400 ×g for 25 min. The mononuclear cells were removed from the upper layer of the gradient, washed in PBS, and counted using a hemacytometer, prior to use. Naı̈ve guinea pigs were killed by CO2inhalation prior to dissection of the thymus and spleen, or by intraperitoneal anesthetic overdose prior to dissection of the airways and lung tissue. To collect bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF), the trachea was cannulated and the lungs were lavaged with 3 × 10-ml fractions of PBS + 10 mm EDTA, which were subsequently pooled after collection. BALF cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in staining buffer (PBS + 0.25% BSA). To isolate tissue cells, samples were roughly chopped into 2- to 3-mm3 pieces and disrupted by passage through a 50-μm pore size tissue disaggregator for 60 s (Medimachine, Dako, Ely, UK). The isolated cells were then washed into staining buffer prior to the analysis of surface chemokine receptor expression by flow cytometry. Human CCR4- or gpCCR4-transfected L1.2 cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml isotype control antibody or 10 μg/ml anti-CCR4 antibodies in staining buffer (PBS + 0.25% BSA) for 30 min on ice, washed by the addition of 1 ml of cold staining buffer, and centrifuged at 350 × g for 5 min, then they were stained with goat anti-mouse FITC-conjugated F(ab)′2 for 20 min on ice in the dark. Cells were then washed and resuspended in 500 μl of staining buffer for acquisition on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountainview, CA). To investigate surface expression of CCR4 in guinea pig blood, 50-μl aliquots of whole blood were washed in staining buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min with primary or isotype control antibody at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Samples were washed, and bound antibody was detected using RPE-conjugated F(ab)′2 rabbit anti-mouse Ig, which had been pre-absorbed with 10% guinea pig serum (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) on ice for 15 min prior to use. Samples were washed and then incubated with an excess of mouse IgG (50 μg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) for 5–10 min. Samples were then incubated with FITC-conjugated antibodies (mouse IgG1, anti-gp Pan T cell, anti-gp T helper subset, or anti-gp CD8 antibodies (all at 1:20 dilution)). A final wash step was carried out, followed by erythrocyte lysis using 1 ml of 1× FACSLyse (Becton Dickinson) per sample according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer, using appropriate compensation settings between fluorochromes. To investigate CCR4 expression on T lymphocyte subsets from various tissues, two-color flow cytometry was carried out on isolated thymocytes, splenocytes, lung tissue cells, and BAL cells as described above, with the omission of the final lysis step. Butyrate-treated gpCCR4 stably transfected L1.2 cells or purified gpPBMCs were washed in ice-cold PBS + 0.25% BSA (assay buffer) and resuspended at a density of 1 × 107cells/ml. 5 × 105 cells were pipetted into pre-chilled Eppendorf tubes and incubated with 50 μl of buffer or chemokines in duplicate, and then incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Control samples were incubated with buffer or the highest concentration of chemokine for 60 min on ice. The cells were then immediately chilled and washed in assay buffer. The duplicate samples of each condition were stained either with the anti-human CCR4 antibody (10E4) or with the IgG1 isotype control antibody to determine if any nonspecific binding was altered under different stimulation conditions. Guinea pig PBMCs were dual stained with FITC-conjugated anti-gp T helper antibody. The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry, and levels of control staining were subtracted from the levels of CCR4 expression. In some experiments cells were preincubated at room temperature for 15 min with 20 μg/ml of either 10E4 or IgG1 and further incubated with the appropriate stimuli for 60 min to examine the ability of 10E4 to block gpCCR4 internalization. Overlap PCR was carried out as described previously (36Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) using huCCR4 or huCCR8 (both HA-tagged) plasmid DNA to amplify the appropriate domains of the chemokine receptors. Chimera 1 comprised the amino terminus of huCCR8 ligated onto the backbone of huCCR4, whereas chimera 2 was the reciprocal construct, comprising the amino terminus of huCCR4 ligated onto the backbone of huCCR8. The amino termini of both receptors are shown in Fig. 8 A. Fusion of each amino terminus was with a conserved leucine within the first transmembrane domain (leucine 42 of huCCR4 and leucine 38 of huCCR8). Sequence analysis verified the expected product. Oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: HA tag sense, 5′-GCG CAT AAG CTT GCC ACC ATG TAT CCA TAT GAG GTC CCA GAG TAT AAA GAA TTC-3′; chimera 1 sense, 5′-CTG CCC CCA CTG TAT TCC TTG GTT T-3′; chimera 1 antisense, 5′-AAA CAA AGG ACA GTG GGG GCA GGA GCA ACT TGC CAT TTG TCT-3′; chimera 2 sense, 5′-CTT GCT GTC TTT TAT TGC CTC CTG T-3′; chimera 2 antisense, 5′-ACA GGA GGC AAT AAA AGA CAG CAA GGA AGA GCT CCC CAA ATG CC-3′; huCCR4 antisense, 5′-ATA TCT CTC GAG CTA CAG AGC ATC ATG AAG ATC AT-3′; huCCR8 antisense, 5′-ATA TCT CTC GAG CCT CAC AAA ATG TAG TCT ACG CTG-3′. 20 μg of chimeric chemokine receptor.pcDNA3 construct was transfected into L1.2 cells as previously described (30Sabroe I. Conroy D.M. Gerard N.P., Li, Y. Collins P.D. Post T.W. Jose P.J. Williams T.J. Gerard C. Ponath P.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6139-6147PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the L1.2 cells were electroporated in the presence of plasmid DNA and subsequently cultured at 37 °C in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 6 h cells were treated with n-butyric acid (final concentration of 10 mm) to stabilize receptor expression and cultured overnight at 37 °C + 5% CO2 in humidified conditions, prior to flow cytometric analysis. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance with a Bonferroni post-test using Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc. San Diego, CA). The 550-bp PCR product amplified from guinea pig genomic DNA using oligonucleotides based on known CCR4 sequences encoded an ORF that was 83% identical, at the nucleotide level, to the human and murine CCR4 sequences. This PCR product therefore provided a specific probe for the subsequent screening of a guinea pig genomic DNA bacteriophage library. A bacteriophage clone with homology to the partial gpCCR4 probe was isolated and digested with EcoRI, and the resulting fragments were shotgun-cloned into pUC19. Based on the hybridization to the gpCCR4 probe and predicted arrangement of the digested fragments, two EcoRI fragments were cloned and sequenced. The smaller fragment contained a 150-bp portion of the deduced ORF; the second fragment contained a 933-bp portion of the deduced ORF. Primers based on these combined sequences amplified a 1.1-kb ORF from guinea pig genomic DNA that contained anEcoRI site at the predicted location. Fig.1 shows the amino acid comparisons of the full open reading frames of human, murine, and guinea pig CCR4. Guinea pig CCR4 shares 81% identity with murine CCR4 and shares 88% amino acid identity with human CCR4. Surprisingly, guinea pig CCR4 possesses an additional serine at position 24 from the amino terminus, compared with human and murine forms of CCR4. The sequence was deposited in the GenBankTM data base (accession number AF431971). L1.2 cells transfected with gpCCR4 were enriched by chemotaxis toward 50 nm murine MDC, isolated by limiting dilution cloning, and subsequently expanded. We investigated the ability of a panel of anti-human CCR4 monoclonal antibodies to detect surface expression of gpCCR4 on these transfected cells by flow cytometry. Each of these antibodies showed some degree of cross-reactivity with guinea pig CCR4. Fig. 2 (A and B) show the staining profiles of butyrate-treated gpCCR4-transfected and huCCR4-transfected L1.2 cells, respectively, with the panel of anti-human CCR4 antibodies. Of these antibodies, 10E4 gave high levels of staining of both human and gpCCR4 transfected cells but did not bind wild-type L1.2 cells (data not shown). We investigated the staining profiles of the anti-huCCR4 antibodies for guinea pig and human lymphocytes using whole blood flow cytometric analysis. Single color flow cytometry revealed that a proportion of cells within the lymphocyte region (as determined by forward/side scatter profiles) bound these antibodies, compared with isotype control. Fig. 3 A shows the staining profiles of human lymphocytes, where between 14 and 20% of lymphocytes were recognized by the anti-huCCR4 antibodies. In contrast, Fig. 3 B shows the staining profiles of guinea pig whole blood staining with the same antibodies. The antibody 2B10 has previously been used to examine CCR4 expression levels on human T lymphocytes (18Andrew D.P. Ruffing N. Kim C.H. Miao W. Heath H., Li, Y. Murphy K. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C.

The mAb 10E4 gave the most consistent staining of gpCCR4-transfected cells and native guinea pig T lymphocytes compared with the other antibodies. To determine the CCR4 expression profiles of guinea pig T lymphocyte phenotypes, two-color flow cytometric analysis was carried out using antibodies against guinea pig T cell markers and the anti-huCCR4 antibody"
https://openalex.org/W1976616850,"The bases that support the versatility of the T cell receptor (TCR) to generate distinct T cell responses remain unclear. We have previously shown that mutant cells in the transmembrane domain of TCRβ chain are impaired in TCR-induced apoptosis but are not affected in other functions. Here we describe the biochemical mechanisms by which this mutant receptor supports some T cell responses but fails to induce apoptosis. Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) is activated at higher and more sustained levels in TCRβ-mutated than in wild type cells. Conversely, activation of both c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase is severely reduced in mutant cells. By attempting to link this unbalanced induction to altered upstream events, we found that ZAP-70 is normally activated. However, although SLP-76 phosphorylation is normally induced, TCR engagement of mutant cells results in lower tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT but in higher tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav than in wild type cells. The results suggest that an altered signaling cascade leading to an imbalance in mitogen-activated protein kinase activities is involved in the selective impairment of apoptosis in these mutant cells. Furthermore, they also provide new insights in the contribution of TCR to decipher the signals that mediate apoptosis distinctly from proliferation.

T cell receptor interleukin extracellular signal-regulated kinase cytotoxic T lymphocyte mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase glutathioneS-transferase Ras-binding domain protein kinase C phospholipase C immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif The TCR1 expressed in the majority of peripheral T lymphocytes is a complex composed of the clonotypic TCR αβ heterodimer, responsible for antigen and superantigen recognition, linked to the monomorphic CD3-γ, -δ, -ε and -ζ chains, which are involved in signal transduction. This structural complexity, in comparison with other families of cytokines and growth receptors, might be responsible for the different outcomes of TCR engagement. The fact that TCR engagement triggers either cytokine-driven proliferation or cell death is particularly intriguing and raises the question of how these outcomes are differentially regulated. It has promoted the concept that the TCR does not function as a simple on-off switch upon activation. In fact, several approaches have provided evidence that TCR could signal to some activation while keeping other pathways functionally inactive (reviewed in Ref. 1Germain R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35223-35226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because of the short length of the cytoplasmic tails and the apparent lack of inherent activity of both clonotypic chains, it is assumed that the heterodimer transmits the signal through the CD3/ζ chains. In this context, questions that remain to be answered are the following. 1) How do engaged TCR transfer signals to initiate signal transduction? 2) Which domains of the TCR conserved regions are involved in such transmission? 3) What effector functions are modulated through the integrity of such domains? Only a few reports have stressed the contribution of individual structural domains of the αβ clonotypic module to specific signal transduction. TCRα chain tail seems to be required for down-regulation of the TCR-CD3 complex (2Backstrom B.T. Rubin B. Peter A. Tiefenthaler G. Palmer E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1433-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and chimeric TCRs containing clonotypic δ instead of α residues in the connecting peptide of the TCRα chain fail to trigger IL-2 production upon cell activation (3Backstrom B.T. Milia E. Peter A. Jaureguiberry B. Baldari C.T. Palmer E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, double positive thymocytes bearing this chimeric TCR undergo negative, but not positive, selection because of a failure in the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (4Backstrom B.T. Muller U. Hausmann B. Palmer E. Science. 1998; 281: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Werlen G. Hausmann B. Palmer E. Nature. 2000; 406: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A single mutation in the β chain connecting peptide results in a TCR that is specifically deficient in activating both the calcium pathway and IL-2 secretion (6Backstrom B.T. Hausmann B.T. Palmer E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1933-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, individual mutations at either of the two conserved Tyr residues in β chain transmembrane domain allow TCR-CD3 expression and are compatible with normal signaling. On the contrary, dual mutations affected signaling efficiency to a greater extent than predicted by surface expression alone and resulted in severe reductions in IL-2 production and apoptosis (7Fuller-Espie S. Hoffman T.P. Wiest D.L. Tietjen I. Spain L.M. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 8Kunjibettu S. Fuller-Espie S. Carey G.B. Spain L.M. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, although different mouse T cell hybridomas dramatically differed in their functional response to the same mutations, these results suggest that membrane-spanning domains in TCRβ are relevant for signal transduction (8Kunjibettu S. Fuller-Espie S. Carey G.B. Spain L.M. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In all works, however, information on how mutations might affect biochemical events involved in the activation of upstream intermediates and signaling pathways is basically lacking. The ability of the TCR to transduce quantitatively and qualitatively different signals is strongly supported by the existence of partial agonists, peptide analogues that can selectively stimulate only some T cell effector functions (9Sloan-Lancaster J. Allen P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Partial agonists, usually related to low affinity ligands, have been proved to be a useful tool to understand mechanisms regulating TCR differential signaling. In fact, a broad variety of such peptides has been described that trigger TCR to usually result in anergy, cytokine production, cytolytic activity, or Fas-mediated cytotoxicity as opposed to perforin-dependent cytotoxicity or proliferation (10Brossart P. Bevan M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2449-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Cao W. Braciale T.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 12Sloan-Lancaster J. Evavold B.D. Allen P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Analogues that selectively impair triggering to apoptosis have not been reported, but, singularly, TCR ligands that uniquely trigger apoptosis in CD4+lymphocytes have been described (13Combadiere B. Sousa C.R. Germain R.N. Lenardo M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). No similar selective peptides have been reported for CD8+ cells. However, some partial agonists, being inducers of T cell cytotoxicity, can dissociate the induction of Fas-L-dependent CTL death from CTL activation and perforin-dependent (14Wei C.H. Beeson C. Masucci M.G. Levitsky V. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2601-2609PubMed Google Scholar) or Fas-L-dependent target cell death (10Brossart P. Bevan M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2449-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Cao W. Braciale T.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In some experimental systems, the ability to divorce killing of the targets and Fas-L-mediated CTL apoptosis has been demonstrated to occur by blocking CD8/MHC class I interaction (15Xu X.N. Purbhoo M.A. Chen N. Mongkolsapaya J. Cox J.H. Meier U.C. Tafuro S. Dunbar P.R. Sewell A.K. Hourigan C.S. Appay V. Cerundolo V. Burrows S.R. McMichael A.J. Screaton G.R. Immunity. 2001; 14: 591-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Two major biochemical events are characteristics of triggering with partial agonist: 1) the phosphorylation of CD3-ζ chains, which results in the predominant phosphorylation of the higher mobility phospho-ζ isoform with the almost absent phosphorylation of the lower mobility isoform, was incomplete, and 2) although ZAP-70 was seen to bind to CD3-ζ following signaling, the ZAP-70 molecule itself was not phosphorylated, and its kinase activity was not induced (16Chau L.A. Bluestone J.A. Madrenas J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Madrenas J. Wange R.L. Wang J.L. Isakov N. Samelson L.E. Germain R.N. Science. 1995; 267: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In this regard, the fact that a consistent pattern of early signaling is not elicited by ligands capable of inducing similar functional responses (9Sloan-Lancaster J. Allen P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 13Combadiere B. Sousa C.R. Germain R.N. Lenardo M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) suggests that differential signaling would take place after CD3-ζ and ZAP-70 phosphorylation. Signal transduction through the TCR is initiated by Src kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the ITAMs of the CD3 and ζ chains, followed by the recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of ZAP-70. The coordinated action of Src kinases and ZAP-70 results in the phosphorylation of multiple substrates. Among these substrates, LAT becomes heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated upon TCR activation, a fact that endows LAT with the capacity for recruiting multiple signaling molecules. It has been hypothesized that signaling through Ras is exquisitely dependent on tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT (18Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence suggest that Ras activation involves additional interactions and that the Ras-MAPK activation can occur through alternative pathways independent of LAT phosphorylation (19Chau L.A. Madrenas J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1853-1858PubMed Google Scholar). These alternative interactions might lead to distinct patterns of ERK activation, which could be associated with the regulation of T cell death or survival (20Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5031) Google Scholar, 21Penninger J.M. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition to Ras, other small GTPases belonging to the Rho family (Rac-1, Cdc42, and RhoA) are activated upon stimulation of the TCR. These GTPases can activate other MAPK cascades, such as the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38MAPKactivation pathways that have also been related to apoptosis (22Zhang J. Gao J.X. Salojin K. Shao Q. Grattan M. Meagher C. Laird D.W. Delovitch T.L. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1017-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Vav is a guanosine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho family GTPases whose exchange activity can be modulated by TCR signaling. Such a mechanism, on operating over Rac-1, has been reported to link the TCR to the activation of JNK and p38MAPK (23Salojin K.V. Zhang J. Delovitch T.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 844-853PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kaminuma O. Deckert M. Elly C. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3126-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). LAT phosphorylation appears to play a critical role on the assembly of ZAP-70-LAT-Vav complexes in lipids rafts and on its translocation in the vicinity of Vav downstream effectors (25Salojin K.V. Zhang J. Meagher C. Delovitch T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5966-5975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been reported that Vav plays TCR-mediated roles other than acting as the GDP/GTP exchanger (26Villalba M. Hernandez J. Deckert M. Tanaka Y. Altman A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Tartare-Deckert S. Monthouel M.N. Charvet C. Foucault I. Van Obberghen E. Bernard A. Altman A. Deckert M. J. Biol.

Gardener S. Nghiem M.P. Bouchard D. Barbacid M. Bernstein A. Penninger J.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 554-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. We have previously reported that Jurkat-derived mutant T cell clones, bearing a mutation (Tyr to Leu) in the C-terminal tyrosine of the conserved ITAM-like motif of the transmembrane domain of ΤCRβ chain, show normal ability: to secrete cytokines (IL-2 and interferon-γ); to express activation markers; to down-modulate their TCR-CD3 complex; and to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ upon TCR activation. However, these mutant cells show a resistance to TCR-induced apoptosis, a defect that is not observed upon direct Fas stimulation or after stimulating with reagents that bypass TCR engagement (i.e. phorbol esters plus calcium ionophore) (29Rodriguez-Tarduchy G.

Immunol. 1999; 29: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Altogether, these findings prompted us to further investigate the effects of the mutation on TCR signaling, in an attempt to clarify the mechanisms by which the integrity of the transmembrane domain of the TCRβ chain contributes to the early biochemical events and MAPK activation pathways associated with TCR-mediated signaling efficiency. Wild type and mutant clones have been previously described (29Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Sahuquillo A.G. Alarcon B. Bragado R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30417-30425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,30Sahuquillo A.G. Roumier A. Teixeiro E. Bragado R. Alarcon B. J. Exp.

Briefly, they were obtained by reconstitution of the TCRβ-negative Jurkat variant 31.13 with either a wild type Vβ3 TCR cDNA or with a mutant cDNA that contains a tyrosine to leucine mutation in the C-terminal tyrosine of the transmembrane domain. No clonal variation was observed between different clones derived from independent wild type or mutant cDNA transfections (29Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Sahuquillo A.G. Alarcon B. Bragado R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30417-30425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Sahuquillo A.G. Roumier A. Teixeiro E. Bragado R. Alarcon B. J. Exp.

Expression of TCR-CD3 complex was routinely tested by flow cytometry before each assay. The following antibodies were used: 1) for cytometry, anti-CD3ε (UCHT-1-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Caltag, Burlingame, CA); anti-TCRVβ3 (JOVI-3, a gift from Dr. M. Owen); and anti-CD69-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Becton Dickinson, Madrid, Spain); 2) for stimulation, anti-CD3ε (UCHT-1, Immunokontact, Switzerland; used for stimulation at 10 μg/ml); anti-CD28 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA; used for stimulation at 1 μg/ml); and the cross-linking antibody goat anti-mouse (Pierce; used for stimulation at 10 μg/ml); 3) for immunoprecipitation assays, anti-ZAP-70 (ZAP-4, a gift from Dr. S. Ley, NIMR, London); anti-LAT and anti-Vav (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); and anti-SLP-76 (kindly provided by Dr. G.

Staphylococcal enterotoxin B was purchased from Toxin Technology (Sarasota, FL; used for stimulation at 10 μg/ml). Biotinylated annexin-V was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin was from Caltag (Burlingame, CA). The construct for the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. 0.5–2.5 × 107 cells/ml were resuspended in RPMI containing 15 mm HEPES. Unless otherwise detailed, stimulation was performed by incubation with anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) together with anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml) antibodies for 10 min on ice followed by cross-linking with goat anti-mouse antibodies at 37 °C for the indicated times. 106 cells were incubated on ice for 1 h with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated specific antibody, washed, and analyzed in a flow cytometer (EPICS-XL MCL, Coulter). 2.5 × 107 cells were unstimulated or stimulated as described and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 1% Brij-96 (or 1% Nonidet P-40), 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin (1 μg/ml each), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mmNaVO4. After centrifugation, the lysates were precleared sequentially with Sepharose beads and with protein A- or G-Sepharose beads coated with the appropriate control antibody and afterward subjected to immunoprecipitation for 4 h at 4 °C with protein A- or G-Sepharose beads coated with specific antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were then washed four times with lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by standard immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Upon stimulation, the cells were resuspended in ice-cold hypothonic buffer (42 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells were transferred to a 1-ml syringe and sheared by being passed five times through a 30-gauge needle. Whole cell lysates were centrifuged at 200 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and cell debris, and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosol) was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin), vortexed for 5 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged again at 13,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant representing the particulate (membrane) fraction was then saved. Each fraction was then diluted to a final concentration of 1× Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE, and the Western blots were analyzed with anti-PKCθ antibodies. 106 cells/time point were unstimulated or stimulated for the indicated times and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 50 μl of a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmHEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the following protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 μg/ml each): leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mm NaVO4. Lysates were then centrifuged, and the supernatants were subjected to standard 10% SDS-PAGE for ERK and p38MAPK or 8% (acrylamide/bisacrylamide 24/0.6) for Raf kinase to improve resolution of phosphorylated band shifts. Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblot analysis with specific antibodies. In the cases of ERK and p38MAPK, their phosphorylation status, as determined by immunoblotting with antibodies that specifically recognize the phosphorylated forms of these kinases, is assumed to be an indication of their activation state. Raf kinase activation was evaluated by the band shifts corresponding to the protein phosphorylated forms, which can be detected by immunoblotting with specific anti-Raf-1 kinase antibodies. 5 × 106 cells/time point were not stimulated or stimulated for the indicated times and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 300 μl of a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin (1 μg/ml each), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm NaVO4. The lysates were then centrifuged, and the supernatants were mixed with 20 μl of a freshly prepared GST fusion protein containing the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 (GST-RBD), immobilized in glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The samples were incubated by rotating for 90 min at 4 °C, and the beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer. The bound Ras-GTP protein was eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The levels of active (GTP-bound) Ras were assessed by immunoblotting with specific anti-Ras antibodies. 5 × 106 cells were not stimulated or stimulated for the indicated times and lysed for 15 min at 4 °C in 200 μl of lysis buffer ( 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifuging, solid phase kinase assays were performed on supernatants by pull-down precipitation as previously described (32Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts were mixed with 10 μl of immobilized GST-c-Jun 1–79, and the samples were rotated at 4 °C for 3 h. After centrifugation, GST-c-Jun-Sepharose beads were washed four times and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 20 μmATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by washing with kinase buffer, and the proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun was quantified using a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Kent, UK) and normalized to JNK as a loading control. We have previously shown that T cell clones bearing a single replacement in the ITAM-like motif of the TCRβ chain transmembrane domain express high amounts of TCR-CD3 complexes, similar to those of wild type cells. In these mutant clones, ZAP-70 becomes normally tyrosine-phosphorylated upon TCR activation. Furthermore, ZAP-70 activity was similar in wild type and mutant cells, as shown in an in vitro kinase assay using an exogenous specific substrate (29Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Sahuquillo A.G. Alarcon B. Bragado R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30417-30425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Sahuquillo A.G. Roumier A. Teixeiro E. Bragado R. Alarcon B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1179-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To further characterize the effects of the mutation in TCR-mediated signal transduction, we tested whether this alteration might affect the in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 substrates in mutant cells. Among these substrates, LAT is an adapter protein that constitutes the foremost scaffold that links the proximal and distal events of the TCR signaling pathway. Immunoprecipitation with specific anti-LAT antibodies followed by immunoblot with anti-phosphotyrosine showed that in comparison with wild type cells, TCR-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT was clearly diminished in mutant cells (Fig. 1A). A longer exposure of the LAT immunoprecipitation membrane revealed the presence of previously described tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that coprecipitate with LAT upon TCR triggering (33Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar) identified as PLCγ1, c-Cbl, Vav, and SLP76. Interestingly, although the levels of LAT-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated SLP76, Vav, and PLCγ1 were reduced in mutant cells, the levels of LAT-associated phospho-c-Cbl were higher. Furthermore, blotting with specific antibodies indicated that mutant cells are defective in the recruitment of PLCγ1, Vav, and SLP-76 to LAT and in a lesser extent in the recruitment of c-Cbl (Fig.1B). Because ZAP70 was not detectable in LAT immunoprecipitates (33Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar) and we had reported that ZAP-70 was scarcely recruited to the plasma membrane in TCR-activated mutant cells (30Sahuquillo A.G. Roumier A. Teixeiro E. Bragado R. Alarcon B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1179-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we performed reverse immunoprecipitation with specific anti-ZAP-70 antibodies to determine whether the low level of induced phospho-LAT in mutant cells was the result of poor activity of ZAP-70 on its membrane substrate. The immunoprecipitation revealed lower levels of coprecipitated phospho-LAT in mutant cells than in wild type cells (Fig. 1C). Furthermore and as expected, the immunoprecipitation revealed similar levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated ZAP-70 in both stimulated cells (Fig.1C). Thus, despite the fact that both the tyrosine phosphorylation level of ZAP-70 and in vitro ZAP-70 activity were similar in both cell types, our results show that the in vivo phosphorylation of LAT and the recruitment to LAT of other signaling molecules are impaired in TCR-stimulated mutant cells. Most of the current evidence suggests that the activation of the Ras-Raf-ERK pathway, after TCR signaling, requires tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT (18Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). If this dependence were absolute, in light of the aforementioned results, we would expect that the impaired LAT phosphorylation would lead downstream to a deficient activation of the ERK pathway in mutant cells. We therefore studied whether the mutation could influence the activation of the Ras-ERK signaling pathway. ERK is the last member in the MAPK cascade that is initiated when Raf is activated after its recruitment by the activated form of Ras. The analysis of the phosphorylation status of ERK, an indication of their activation state (34Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), upon TCR engagement revealed not only that the induced ERK activity was higher in mutant cells than in wild type cells but also that this activity lasted longer. Thus, although both activities peaked at 5 min, a high phosphorylation in both p42 and p44 bands was still observed at 60 min in mutant cells, whereas in wild type cells, ERK phosphorylation was almost undetectable after 20 min of stimulation (Fig. 2A). Expression of ERK, assessed by immunoblotting with anti-ERK antibodies, was unaffected by TCR stimulation. As controls, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate alone or in combination with ionomycin induced similar kinetics and ERK activities in both wild type and mutant cells (not shown). It was then reasonable to test whether this altered activity of ERK in mutant cells could be the consequence of a similar activation pattern of the upstream intermediates Raf and Ras. Interestingly, the activation of Raf in mutant cells was higher and was sustained longer compared with that in wild type cells, as evidenced by the band shift corresponding to the phosphorylated forms of Raf (Fig. 2B). Finally, we evaluated the levels of active (GTP-bound) Ras by pull-down experiments using an immobilized GST fusion protein containing the RBD of Raf. As shown in Fig. 2C (upper panels), the levels of Ras-GTP significantly increased as early as 1 min in mutant cells, were similarly maintaine"
