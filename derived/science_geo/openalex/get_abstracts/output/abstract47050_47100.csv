https://openalex.org/W1605420823,"cDNA clones for rat R-type pyruvate kinase and a genomic clone encoding both L- and R-type isozyme mRNAs were isolated. Their sequences were compared with that of the L-type isozyme cDNA to determine the sequences of mRNA and protein of the R-type isozyme and the organizations of the L- and R-type genes. Results showed that the R-type isozyme mRNA had an identical nucleotide sequence to that of the L-type except in the 5'-terminal region including the coding sequence and the length of the 3'-untranslated region. The sequence upstream of the 5th coding residue of the L-type was replaced by a 98-nucleotide coding sequence plus a 5'-untranslated region in the R-type isozyme. Therefore, the R-type subunit consists of 574 amino acids, which is 31 residues longer than the L-type at the amino terminus. The pyruvate kinase L gene is present as a single copy per haploid genome and is composed of 12 exons and 11 introns with a length of about 9.3 kilobase pairs. The first (exon R) and second (exon L) exons encode the 5'-terminal sequences specific for the R- and L-types, respectively. The remaining downstream exons encode a sequence common to both isozymes. The last exon contains the entire 3'-untranslated region, including several putative polyadenylation signals. Alternative use of these signals is reported to be responsible for generation of multiple mRNA species for the L-type, whereas the R-type uses only the first signal. The cap site is mapped 16 nucleotides upstream from the translation initiation site for the L-type, whereas multiple cap sites were suggested for the R-type. The canonical promoter of the TATA box was identified in the upstream sequence of exon L, but not in that of exon R. Instead, the 5'-flanking region of exon R contained another promoter sequence of the CAT box. Thus, we conclude that the L- and R-type isozymes of pyruvate kinase are produced from a single gene by use of different promoters."

https://openalex.org/W1499122117,"Intrinsic troponin C (TnC) was extracted from small bundles of rabbit psoas fibers and replaced with TnC labeled with dansylaziridine (5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl). The flourescence of incorporated dansylaziridine-labeled TnC was enhanced by the binding of Ca2+ to the Ca2+-specific (regulatory) sites of TnC and was measured simultaneously with force (Zot, H.G., Guth, K., and Potter, J.D. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15883-15890). Various myosin cross-bridge states also altered the fluorescence of dansylaziridine-labeled TnC in the filament, with cycling cross-bridges having a greater effect than rigor cross-bridges; and in both cases, there was an additional effect of Ca2+. The paired fluorescence and tension data were used to calculate the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the regulatory sites in the thin filament and were shown to increase at least 10-fold during muscle activation presumably due to the interaction of cycling cross-bridges with the thin filament. The cross-bridge state responsible for this enhanced Ca2+ affinity was shown to be the myosin-ADP state present only when cross-bridges are cycling. The steepness of the pCa force curves (where pCa represents the -log of the free Ca2+ concentration) obtained in the presence of ATP at short and long sarcomere lengths was the same, suggesting that cooperative interactions between adjacent troponin-tropomyosin units may spread along much of the actin filament when cross-bridges are attached to it. In contrast to the cycling cross-bridges, rigor bridges only increased the Ca2+ affinity of the regulatory sites 2-fold. Taken together, the results presented here indicate a strong coupling between the Ca2+ regulatory sites and cross-bridge interactions with the thin filament."
https://openalex.org/W1583700955,"The role of the choroid plexus in thyroid hormone transport between body and brain, suggested by strong synthesis and secretion of transthyretin in this tissue, was investigated in in vitro and in vivo systems. Rat choroid plexus pieces incubated in vitro were found to accumulate thyroid hormones from surrounding medium in a non-saturable process. At equilibrium, the ratio of thyroid hormone concentration in choroid plexus pieces to that in medium decreased upon increasing the concentration of transthyretin in the medium. Fluorescence quenching of fluorophores located at different depths in liposome membranes showed maximal hormone accumulation in the middle of the phospholipid bilayer. Partition coefficients of thyroxine and triiodothyronine between lipid and aqueous phase were about 20,000. After intravenous injection of 125I-labeled thyroid hormones, choroid plexus and parts of the brain steadily accumulated 125I-thyroxine, but not [125I]triiodothyronine, for many hours. The accumulation of 125I-thyroxine in choroid plexus preceded that in brain. The amount of 125I-thyroxine in non-brain tissues and the [125I]triiodothyronine content of all tissues decreased steadily beginning immediately after injection. A model is proposed for thyroxine transport from the bloodstream into cerebrospinal fluid based on partitioning of thyroxine between choroid plexus and surrounding fluids and binding of thyroxine to transthyretin newly synthesized and secreted by choroid plexus."
https://openalex.org/W1581885355,"In a reconstituted system containing NADPH, dilauroyl-L-3-phosphatidylcholine, and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase purified from rat liver microsomes, cytochrome P-450 (P-450 HFLa) purified from human fetal livers catalyzed the 16 alpha-hydroxylation of dehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulfate (DHEA-sulfate). Addition of cytochrome b5 purified from rat liver microsomes to the reconstituted system resulted in a remarkable increase in the hydroxylase activity. The level of P-450 HFLa in liver homogenates from human fetuses highly correlated with the activity of DHEA-sulfate 16 alpha-hydroxylase. Antibodies to P-450 HFLa inhibited the 16 alpha-hydroxylation of DHEA-sulfate in a dose-dependent manner. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of P-450 HFLa was similar to that of P-450NF (Beaune, P. H., Umbenhauer, D. R., Bork, R. W., Lloyd, R. S., and Guengerich, F. P. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 8064-8068). We conclude that P-450 HFLa is a form of cytochrome P-450 involved in the 16 alpha-hydroxylation of DHEA-sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1670623565,"Proteolysis by trypsin of gizzard myosin light chain kinase in the absence of Ca2+-calmodulin causes a biphasic effect on kinase activity. During the initial phase of proteolysis, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase activity is reduced over a thousand-fold. Further proteolysis, in the second phase, causes an increase in activity that is independent of Ca2+-calmodulin. Loss of activity is associated with the formation of a 64,000-dalton fragment. Calmodulin-independent activity is associated with the formation of a 61,000-dalton fragment. Procedures for the isolation of each fragment are outlined. Tryptic hydrolysis of the isolated 64,000-dalton peptide generates the 61,000-dalton peptide and increases calmodulin-independent activity. Km values for ATP and light chains for the native kinase and two fragments are the same, i.e. approximately 100 and 5 microM, respectively. Neither fragment binds to F-actin. Amino acid analyses of both fragments are given. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the calmodulin-binding regions of the smooth and skeletal muscle kinases are potent inhibitors of the 61,000-dalton fragment. These data demonstrate the existence of an inhibitory region that is suggested to be located between the active site and the calmodulin-binding site. Whether it is distinct from or at the N-terminal end of the calmodulin-binding site cannot be determined from these data."
https://openalex.org/W1525541702,"Phaseolin, the major storage protein of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), is a glycoprotein which is synthesized during seed development and accumulates in protein storage vacuoles or protein bodies. The protein has three different N-linked oligosaccharide side chains: Man9(GlcNAc)2, Man7(GlcNAc)2, and Xyl-Man3(GlcNAc)2 (where Xyl represents xylose). The structures of these glycans were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The Man9(GlcNAc)2 glycan has the typical structure found in plant and animal glycoproteins. The structures of the two other glycans are shown below. (Formula; see text) Phaseolin was separated by electrophoresis on denaturing gels into four size classes of polypeptides. The two abundant ones have two oligosaccharides each, whereas the less abundant ones have only one oligosaccharide each. Polypeptides with two glycans have Man7(GlcNAc)2 attached to Asn252 and Man9(GlcNAc)2 attached to Asn341. Polypeptides with only one glycan have Xyl-Man3(GlcNAc)2 attached to Asn252. Both these asparagine residues are in canonical glycosylation sites; the numbering starts with the N-terminal methionine of the signal peptide of phaseolin. The presence of the Man7(GlcNAc)2 and of Xyl-Man3(GlcNAc)2 at the same asparagine residue (position 252) of different polypeptides seems to be controlled by the glycosylation status of Asn341. When Asp341 is unoccupied, the glycan at Asn252 is complex. When Asn341 is occupied, the glycan at Asn252 is only modified to the extent that 2 mannosyl residues are removed. The processing of the glycans, after the removal of the glucose residues, involves enzymes in the Golgi apparatus as well as in the protein bodies. Formation of the Xyl-Man3(GlcNAc)2 glycan is a multistep process that involves the Golgi apparatus-mediated removal of 6 mannose residues and the addition of 2 N-acetylglucosamine residues and 1 xylose. The terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues are later removed in the protein bodies. The conversion of Man9(GlcNAc)2 to Man7(GlcNAc)2 is a late processing event which occurs in the protein bodies. Experiments in which [3H]glucosamine-labeled phaseolin obtained from the endoplasmic reticulum (i.e. precursor phaseolin) is incubated with jack bean alpha-mannosidase show that the high mannose glycan on Asn252, but not the one on Asn341, is susceptible to enzyme degradation. Incubation of [3H] glucosamine-labeled phaseolin obtained from the Golgi apparatus with jack bean beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase results in the removal of the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues from the complex chain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1521541176,We have characterized a streptavidin product that had been reduced to a minimal size that still retained full biotin-binding activity. This core streptavidin is proteolyzed at both ends at points that correspond closely with the termini of hen egg white avidin. Core streptavidin is more soluble than is the parent molecule. We have grown three different types of crystals of core streptavidin. The symmetry properties of these crystals prove that the molecule is a tetramer organized in tetrahedral (D2) point symmetry. The crystallographic response to the interaction of biotin with core streptavidin indicates that some conformational change accompanies ligand binding. We are attempting to determine the three-dimensional structure of streptavidin and its complex with selenobiotin from these crystals of core streptavidin.

A human spleen cDNA library was screened with a 48-mer oligonucleotide probe, synthesized according to the partial amino acid sequence of the human leukocyte enzyme. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA had an open reading frame of 1,833 base pairs, which contained regions coding for the N-terminal amino acid sequence, the amino acid sequence for the probe design, and several other peptide sequences of the enzyme. The complete primary structure of the enzyme composed of 610 amino acid residues (molecular weight, 69,153) was deduced from the cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1535873009,"cis-Fatty acids such as oleic acid or linoleic acid have been previously shown to induce full activation of protein kinase C in the absence of Ca2+ and phospholipids (Murakami, K., and Routtenberg, A. (1985) FEBS Lett. 192, 189-193; Murakami, K., Chan, S.Y., and Routtenberg, A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15424-15429). In this study, we have investigated the effects of various metal ions on protein kinase C activity without the interference of Ca2+ since cis-fatty acid requires no Ca2+ for protein kinase C activation. Here we report a specific interaction of Zn2+ with protein kinase C in either a positive or negative cooperative fashion in concert with Ca2+. At low concentrations (approximately 5 microM) of Ca2+, Zn2+ enhances protein kinase C activity induced by both oleic acid and phosphatidylserine/diolein. In contrast, Zn2+ inhibits the activity at higher concentrations (over 50 microM) of Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+, Zn2+ shows no effect on protein kinase C activity. Our results suggest that Zn2+ does not recognize or interact with protein kinase C in the absence of Ca2+, that protein kinase C possesses high and low affinity Ca2+-binding sites, and that at least one Zn2+-binding site exists which is distinct from Ca2+-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1663123254,"The GTP-activated Ca2+ release process we recently described (Gill, D. L., Ueda, T., Chueh, S. H., and Noel, M. W. (1986) Nature 320, 461-464) was revealed in the preceding report to operate via a mechanism likely to be induced by close membrane association but which appears not to involve membrane fusion (Chueh, S. H., Mullaney, J. M., Ghosh, T. K., Zachary, A. L., and Gill, D. L. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 13857-13864). To determine more about the GTP-activated Ca2+ translocation process, effects of GTP on cells loaded with Ca-oxalate were investigated. Using permeabilized cells of both the N1E-115 neuroblastoma and DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cell lines, 10 microM GTP activates a profound uptake of Ca2+ in the presence of oxalate, as opposed to release observed without oxalate. GTP stimulation of Ca2+ uptake was observed at oxalate concentrations (2 mM) only slightly augmenting Ca2+ uptake without GTP; with 8 mM oxalate (which alone induces linear Ca2+ accumulation) GTP still increases the rate of uptake. GTP-activated uptake in the presence of oxalate is completely reversed by 1 mM vanadate. 3% polyethylene glycol enhances the effect of GTP although GTP-activated uptake is still observed without polyethylene glycol. The Km for GTP for activation of Ca2+ uptake is 0.9 microM. Uptake is not activated by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) or guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate (GppNHp); however, GTP gamma S (but not GppNHp) completely blocks the action of GTP. GDP gives a delayed uptake response which is blocked by ADP, indicating its action arises from conversion to GTP. In the presence of ADP, GDP blocks the action of GTP; guanosine 5'-O-(2-thio)diphosphate, which does not activate uptake, also blocks the action of GTP. These data reveal almost exact correlation between parameters affecting GTP-activated uptake and release, strongly suggesting the same process mediates both events. To explain the opposite effects of GTP in the absence and presence of oxalate, it is proposed that GTP activates a transmembrane conveyance of Ca2+ between oxalate-permeable and -impermeable compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1534631025,"An expression vector was constructed that placed the cDNA for human neuropeptide Y (NPY) under the control of the mouse metallothionein promoter and was used to transfect the AtT-20 mouse anterior pituitary corticotrope cell line. AtT-20 cells normally process the pro-ACTH/endorphin precursor but do not produce detectable levels of NPY. The resulting AtT-20/NPY cell line (Mt.NPY1a) was used to study the ability of the corticotrope cells to synthesize, process, and secrete the foreign proNPY-related peptide products. The stable cell line created contains approximately 40 copies of proNPY cDNA per cell. NPY mRNA levels and proNPY synthesis were increased at least 35-fold when maximally induced with cadmium; proNPY synthesis was also induced by glucocorticoids. Upon induction the NPY secretion rate was equimolar to that of the endogenous peptides. ProNPY, NPY, and the COOH-terminal peptide produced by this cell line had molecular weight and amino acid-labeling pattern predicted from cDNA sequence data and from previous isolation of NPY-related molecules from NPY-producing cells. The structures of secreted proNPY, NPY, and COOH-terminal peptide, as well as determination of the site of proteolytic cleavage between NPY and the COOH-terminal peptide, were determined by tryptic mapping and Edman degradation of secreted biosynthetically labeled peptide products. The proNPY molecule appears to be processed in the same pathway responsible for cleavage of the endogenous pro-ACTH/endorphin precursor. Secretion of proNPY-derived peptides paralleled secretion of endogenous pro-ACTH/endorphin-derived products, under both basal and stimulated conditions. With induction proNPY expression there is a dose-dependent inhibition of both proNPY and pro-ACTH/endorphin proteolytic processing."
https://openalex.org/W1515503433,"Abstract Affinity labeling of the rat pancreatic cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor with decapeptide probes has identified an Mr = 85,000-95,000 protein, distinct from the Mr = 80,000 component previously labeled with 125I-Bolton Hunter-CCK-33. We have characterized the carbohydrate composition of this novel protein labeled with 125I-D-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31)-CCK-26-33] and disuccinimidyl suberate by using chemical and enzymatic deglycosylation and lectin chromatography. The Mr = 85,000-95,000 component was demonstrated to be an N-linked sialoglycoprotein based on neuraminidase digestion to Mr = 75,000-85,000 and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F (Endo F) digestion to Mr = 42,000. This was distinct from the Mr = 65,000 product of Endo F digestion of the protein labeled with 125I-Bolton Hunter-CCK-33. Lack of an effect of endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H demonstrated the absence of N-linked simple oligosaccharides, while products of chemical deglycosylation with hydrogen fluoride and endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase supported the absence of O-linked carbohydrate. The presence of at least four oligosaccharide chains on the core protein was suggested by Endo F digestion of the Mr = 85,000-95,000 protein using limiting enzyme conditions. This glycoprotein was retained on wheat germ agglutininagarose and eluted by N,N',N-triacetylchitotriose. Identification of the Mr = 85,000-95,000 component on the ectodomain of the plasmalemma of intact pancreatic acini confirmed this to be the fully processed form of the CCK-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1499291609,"Using nondegradative isolation procedures, we have purified and characterized the Mr 24,000 phosphoprotein from developing bovine and human bone where it constitutes 5% of the noncollagenous protein in the mineral compartment. This hydroxyproline-containing protein could not be cleaved by cyanogen bromide. The purified, intact product spontaneously formed a complex consistent with a collagen-like trimer that remained a trimer even in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The ability to form the complex was lost upon treatment with bacterial collagenase, a treatment that resulted in an NH2-terminally blocked fragment of Mr 17,000. After deblocking, the NH2-terminus of the intact, Mr 24,000 bovine product was shown to have virtually the same amino acid sequence (residues 1-24 with asparagine rather than aspartic acid at position 20 as reported earlier by Horlein et al. (Horlein, D., Fietzek, P. P., Wachter, E., Lapiere, C. M., and Kuhn, K. (1979) Eur. J. Biochem. 90, 31-38) as the amino-terminal segment of dermatosparatic calf skin alpha 1 type I procollagen. Furthermore, pulse-chase studies showed a precursor-product relationship between procollagen and the Mr 24,000 protein. Anti-serum made against the bovine bone protein bound to bands on electrotransfers that were consistent with the positions of both alpha 1(I) procollagen and the procollagen chain missing its COOH-terminal extension peptide (pN-alpha 1(I), as well as the original Mr 24,000 product in extracts of bone, skin, tendon, cornea, and other type I collagen-containing tissues. Fetal calf serum contained an average of 106 micrograms/ml of the Mr 24,000 protein as determined by quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The only serine residue in the bovine bone protein was phosphorylated. It is unknown whether the corresponding collagen NH2-terminal pro-peptides in other tissues and serum are similarly phosphorylated."
https://openalex.org/W1503883500,Previous work from this laboratory and others has shown that the hydrolysis of pure dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes by porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2 in the vicinity of the gel-to-liquid crystal phase transition is characterized by a slow initial phase followed by an apparent burst of activity. In this article we report a detailed quantitative analysis of the early time course of the hydrolysis of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine large unilamellar vesicles at 38 degrees C. Several kinetic models to quantitatively describe the data were considered. The most conservative model consistent with the kinetic data is one in which the enzyme initially binds the bilayer and becomes activated via a process that requires the formation of protein dimers on the surface of the membrane. The relevant kinetic parameters of the model are reported.
https://openalex.org/W1500964327,"Synthetic overlapping peptides of the alpha-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) were made by solid-phase peptide synthesis employing a comprehensive synthetic approach. The entire primary structure of the alpha-subunit was synthesized as a series of nine consecutive peptides, each 15 residues in length, and overlapping with its two adjacent neighbors by 5 residues on each side. Receptor binding activity of each synthetic peptide was measured by the inhibition of binding of 125I-labeled hCG to rat ovarian receptor. Peptides alpha 21-35, alpha 31-45, alpha 71-85, and alpha 81-92 were shown to compete for binding with native hCG, thus demonstrating that at least two regions on the alpha-subunit may be part of the binding site(s) of the hormone. The low affinity of the peptides (10(-5)-10(-6) M) compared to native hormone (10(-10) M) for receptor is not unexpected due to the probability of discontinuous and multiple sites involved in receptor binding. An ultrapure preparation of hCG alpha-subunit also had low affinity (10(-5), suggesting that conformational changes upon combination with beta-subunit to form dimer or changes in conformation after binding are necessary for high affinity interaction. These results correlate with previous predictions of binding sites based on studies employing chemical and enzymatic modifications of intact hormone and show that synthetic peptide strategies are helpful in the elucidation of protein structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1505015982,"We have investigated the structural features of sulfated fucose-containing polysaccharides which are responsible for their selective binding to Strongylocentrotus purpuratus bindin. The data presented demonstrate that the sulfate esters and a molecular weight in excess of approximately 15,000 are required for high affinity binding of the fucans to bindin. Desulfation destroys the binding activity of the fucans, which can be fully restored by chemical resulfation. Fucan fragments of an average molecular weight of 15,000 were nearly as active as the starting material (Mr 10(6)). The observed IC50 value for fragments of Mr congruent to 10,000 and Mr congruent to 5,000 were 1 and 2 orders of magnitude higher, respectively. The binding of fucoidan to bindin is stable in high salt (50% at 1.2 M NaCl) whereas the binding of fucoidan to DEAE-cellulose or polylysine is inhibited by the concentrations of salt normally found in sea water (50% at 0.2 and 0.5 M NaCl, respectively). This result suggests that the binding mechanism is not a simple ionic interaction and that hydrogen bonding and cooperativity may also be important determinants of the binding mechanism. We also found that polyvinyl sulfate binds to bindin with high affinity and inhibits the bindin-mediated agglutination of sea urchin eggs. The results of these investigations suggest that the spatial orientation of the sulfate esters plays a critical role in determining the selectivity of sulfated polysaccharide binding and that the polysaccharide backbone does not play a direct role in the binding mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1589194254,"Juvenile hormone (JH) esterase was purified greater than 1000-fold in one step from hemolymph and whole larval homogenates from the last larval instar of Trichoplusia ni to give a single diffuse band that migrates at Mr = 64,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purification was based on an affinity chromatography procedure that employs trifluoromethyl ketone ligands. Isoelectric focusing of the purified preparations resulted in multiple bands that coincided to all significant hydrolysis of juvenile hormone detected in this manner. Kinetic experiments using optically pure enantiomers of JH II as substrates showed the two main electromorphs of JH esterase from the hemolymph to have apparently identical kinetic parameters as well as a similar capability to distinguish between substrates that differ in the orientation of the epoxide moiety of JH. However, the enzyme could hydrolyze esters lacking the JH structure. The proteins were shown to be monomers and to have asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, most likely of hybrid structure. Immunochemical and other evidence showed that the affinity-purified proteins were responsible for all significant JH esterase activity during periods of rapid esterolysis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2138151360,"The methotrexate (MTX) and folate transport properties of five MTX-resistant lines of Leishmania major have been examined. These resistant lines all show a decreased Vmax for MTX influx, with no change in apparent affinity (Kt). The Vmax of folate influx is also proportionately decreased without alteration in Kt, supporting our proposal that there is a single carrier mediating influx of both ligands. Amplifications of two regions of DNA, the R region (encoding dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase) and the H region (Beverley, S.M., Coderre, J.A., Santi, D.V., and Schimke, R.T. (1984) Cell 38, 431-439), were also observed. In a given line, the amplifications occurred singly, in combination, or not at all. No other regions of amplification were detected. The phenotype of reduced MTX transport was moderately stable in the highly resistant R1000 line, being retained for more than 200 generations in the absence of MTX in vitro and during one passage through an infected mouse; in contrast, R- and H-amplified DNA were less stable. The lack of correlation of R and H amplification with reduced MTX transport suggests that alterations in transport are not causally mediated by gene amplification in Leishmania, but are a separate mode of MTX resistance. The onset of decreased MTX transport was also examined; wild-type Leishmania developed a reduced Vmax of MTX influx within 24 h following exposure to 1 microM MTX, which is extremely unstable in the absence of drug pressure. A comparable decrease in the Vmax of influx is seen in cells exposed to MTX in media in which cytotoxicity is eliminated. As the folate/MTX transporter is regulated by exogenous folate, these data suggest that the initial rapid decrease in MTX transport may be a cellular regulatory response, in contrast to that found within the R1000 line which resembles a more stable genetic mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1580797189,"The proteoglycans (PG) of bovine fetal tendon (4-8 months in utero) were extracted with 4 M guanidine HCl and partially purified by ion exchange chromatography. Proteoglycans from fetal tendon were virtually entirely small molecules (Kav approximately equal to 0.55 by Sepharose CL-4B chromatography). These small proteoglycans had dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains and a core protein (after chondroitinase ABC digestion) with Mr approximately equal to 45,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. By electrophoretic mobility, immunocross-reactivity, and V8 protease sensitivity, these proteoglycans were determined to be of both PG I and PG II types. In contrast, adult tendon contains only the PG II type of small proteoglycan. Proteoglycans synthesized by fetal tendon explant cultures were, by both chromatographic and electrophoretic mobilities, somewhat larger than those extracted from the same tissue. There was no difference in the spectrum of proteoglycans observed between those regions of fetal tendon destined to receive only tensional forces (proximal) and those regions that will be subjected as well to compressive forces (distal) in the adult. These observations indicate that the proteoglycan content and synthetic capability of all regions of fetal tendon are constant and significantly different from those of both the tensional and fibrocartilaginous regions of adult tendon."
https://openalex.org/W1592084935,"We have isolated and purified to homogeneity an alpha, alpha'-trehalose 6-monomycolate:alpha, alpha'-trehalose mycolyltransferase (trehalose mycolyltransferase) from Mycobacterium smegmatis that catalyzes the exchange of a mycolyl group between trehalose, trehalose 6-monomycolate (TM), and trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate (TD). This enzyme was prominent in M. smegmatis and it catalyzed the following reactions. TM + [14C]trehalose in equilibrium [14C]TM + trehalose [14C]TM + TM in equilibrium [14C]TD + trehalose This enzyme was purified by (i) ammonium sulfate fractionation, (ii) QAE-Sephadex A-50 column chromatography, (iii) gel filtration on a Sephadex G-75 column, and (iv) SP-Sephadex C-50 column chromatography. The purified protein yielded a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and its molecular weight was estimated to be 25,000. This enzyme was a glycoprotein, had no cofactor requirement, and was highly specific for alpha, alpha'-trehalose as the mycolate acceptor. It was less specific for the acyl donor group since the palmitoyl group in trehalose 6-monopalmitate was easily exchangeable. There was no TM acylhydrolase activity in the purified enzyme, suggesting that it is probably associated with the anabolic pathway of mycolic acid metabolism. We postulate the formation of a mycolyl-enzyme intermediate in this reaction. Such an intermediate could play a central role in the transfer of mycolic acid to form the prominent cell wall components of mycobacterial TD and possibly murein-arabinogalactan-mycolate."
https://openalex.org/W1576617261,"Abstract Ferritin from the soyabean Glycine max was isolated and characterized. The protein has many features in common with ferritin from mammalian systems, including extensive sequence homology, as determined by two-dimensional peptide mapping. No immunocross-reactivity between the plant and animal proteins was detected. The ferritin isolated by MgCl2 precipitation has a single subunit of 28 kDa, whereas the ferritin remaining in the supernatant exhibits marked heterogeneity, with a main subunit of 22 kDa. This form of the protein appears to be the result of specific proteolytic processing that is not affected by serine protease inhibitors, and appears only after the seeds have been soaked long enough to induce germination. The appearance of the 22-kDa form corresponds to the appearance of arrays of ferritin in the amyloplasts of the plant cotyledons and may represent a plant form of hemosiderin. In support of this hypothesis, the 22-kDa protein appears to be incompletely assembled, as determined by sucrose gradient centrifugation and iron uptake studies. Although ferritin is normally quite resistant to proteolysis, the 22-kDa protein is easily generated from the 28-kDa form by treatment with subtilisin, suggesting the presence of a specific, protease-sensitive sequence on the protein's surface, possibly used to mark the phytoferritin for conversion to hemosiderin and construction of ferritin crystalline arrays."
https://openalex.org/W1555370034,"We have isolated and determined the nucleotide sequence of overlapping cDNA clones, representing the entire structural gene for pig thyroid peroxidase. The protein coding region extends from an ATG residue at base 252 to a termination codon at base 3030, coding for a 100.4-kDa apoprotein of 926 amino acids. The derived amino acid composition agrees well with the experimentally determined amino acid composition of purified pig thyroid peroxidase. Five potential glycosylation sites are present in the protein. Potential membrane spanning regions are present at the amino-terminal end (1-23) and near the carboxyl-terminal end (845-870) of the protein. These data indicate that pig thyroid peroxidase is synthesized as a single polypeptide that is membrane-bound."
https://openalex.org/W1527962461,"The degradation and short-term resynthesis of adenine nucleotides have been examined in a preparation of isolated rat heart myocytes. These myocyte preparations are essentially free of vascular and endothelial cells, contain levels of adenine nucleotides quite comparable to those of intact heart tissue, and retain these components remarkably well for up to 2 h of aerobic incubation in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+. When the cells are rapidly and synchronously de-energized by addition of uncoupler, an inhibitor of respiration and iodoacetate, cellular ATP is degraded almost quantitatively to AMP. The AMP is then converted to either intracellular adenosine, which accumulates to high concentrations before release to the cell exterior, or to IMP. The relative contribution of these two pathways depends on the metabolic state of the cells just prior to de-energization, with IMP production favored when respiring cells are de-energized and adenosine formation predominant when glycolyzing myocytes are subjected to this treatment. Cells de-energized by anaerobiosis in the absence of glucose lose ATP and adenine nucleotides with the production of IMP and adenosine. Upon reoxygenation, these cells restore a high adenylate energy charge and about 60% of control levels of GTP. There is a net resynthesis of 5-7 nmol of adenine nucleotides.mg-1 protein with a corresponding decline in IMP. Added [14C]adenosine labels the adenine nucleotide pool, but little net resynthesis of adenine nucleotides via adenosine kinase can be detected. It therefore appears that a rapid regeneration of adenine nucleotides can occur via the enzymes of the purine nucleotide cycle in heart myocytes and is limited by the size of the IMP pool retained."
https://openalex.org/W1543971072,"The fluorescent-labeled phospholipid, 1-palmitoyl-2-[12-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecan oyl] phosphatidylcholine (P-C12-NBD-PC), is highly self-quenched when contained as a high mole percent in phospholipid vesicles. The addition of nonspecific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP), which is identical to sterol carrier protein2, to P-C12-NBD-PC self-quenching vesicles results in a large increase in the fluorescence yield. Evidence is presented that demonstrates that this fluorescence increase results from the binding of P-C12-NBD-PC to one or more low dielectric sites on the nsLTP molecule and that the P-C12-NBD-PC.nsLTP complex can exist free in aqueous solution. The binding is inhibited in the presence of mersalyl, a thiol reagent, and can be reversed with excess cysteine. Transfer of the nsLTP-bound P-C12-NBD-PC to phospholipid vesicles is also demonstrated. The half-times for loading and unloading the P-C12-NBD-PC.nsLTP complex are both 3 orders of magnitude faster than the spontaneous P-C12-NBD-PC transfer between vesicles. These data demonstrate that nsLTP has the necessary properties to bind and carry lipids between membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1559269482,"In a previous publication (Saucier, S.E., A.A., Taylor, F.R., Spencer, T.A., Phirwa, S., and Gayen, A.K., J. Biol. Chem. (1985) 260, 14571-14579), we demonstrated that cultured Chinese hamster lung (Dede) cells contain 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol in cellular concentrations within the range required to repress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. In this paper, we show that the addition to the culture medium of a concentration of mevalonate high enough to repress the reductase by 90% resulted in the appearance of two new regulatory oxysterols. The two new sterols are believed to be 32-oxolanosterol and 32-hydroxylanosterol on the basis of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) retention times and mass spectrometric and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic data and by NaBH4 reduction of the putative aldehyde to material which had the HPLC retention time of the putative alcohol. The cellular concentrations of 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol were not significantly changed by the presence of mevalonate. However, there was approximately a 30% increase in total HMG-CoA reductase repressor units which can be ascribed to the 32-oxolanosterol and 32-hydroxylanosterol, where 1 unit equals the repressor activity of 1 ng of 25-hydroxycholesterol. These results support the idea that the level of HMG-CoA reductase activity in growing cell cultures is determined by intracellular oxysterol metabolites and that relatively small changes in their numbers or concentrations can alter the level of HMG-CoA reductase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1585749523,"Human choriogonadotropin (hCG) is a placental glycoprotein hormone composed of a 92-amino acid alpha subunit noncovalently linked to a 145-amino acid beta subunit. We report here the expression of biologically active hCG in mouse C127 cells transfected with expression vectors containing the DNA coding for both subunits. In addition, the same cell line was used to express the alpha subunit alone. The expression products were purified by affinity chromatography using specific monoclonal antibodies to hCG or its subunits. The system secreting biologically active hCG also produced a 10-fold or greater molar excess of free beta subunit. The dimeric hormone, as well as the excess beta subunit, resembles the standard urinary hCG and beta subunit by chemical and biological criteria. In contrast, when the vector encoding for the alpha subunit was expressed alone, the alpha subunit had a higher molecular weight than both standard alpha and the alpha found in the expressed dimeric hormone. The molecular weight difference between expressed alpha subunit and standard alpha was found to reside in the alpha peptide consisting of residues 52-91 which contained all of the carbohydrate of the alpha subunit. The N-asparagine-linked carbohydrate moieties in the recombinant alpha were found to be triantennary in contrast to biantennary in urinary alpha, and this hyperglycosylation was responsible for the higher molecular weight of the alpha subunit when it was expressed alone. We found no evidence of O-threonine glycosylation at position alpha 39 reported to be present in free forms of the alpha subunit; however, the companion paper (Corless, C.L., Bielinska, M., Ramabhadran, T. V., Daniels-McQueen, S. Otani, T., Reitz, B. A., Tiemeier, D. C., and Boime, I. (1987) J. Biol Chem. 262, 14197-14203) finds a small quantity of O-glycosylation. Since the excess beta subunit appears to be of normal size and contains the expected complement of sugars, only free alpha subunit seems to be a potential substrate for addition of extra sugar moieties. No large beta subunit forms have been found by others, while large alpha subunits have been described both clinically and in tissue culture systems. These observations imply that the conformation of the free alpha subunit, in the regions of the glycosylation recognition sites, allows easier access for glycosyltransferases than those same sites in the beta subunit. When alpha is combined with beta, the local structures around the alpha glycosylation sites are apparently altered so as to make the synthesis of triantennary chains less favorable."
https://openalex.org/W1515779841,"Fibroblast pneumonocyte factor (FPF) synthesis by fetal rat lung fibroblasts is augmented during gestation in the presence of cortisol. The control and cortisol-augmented levels of FPF production, as determined by FPF ability to stimulate saturated phosphotidylcholine synthesis by lung epithelial Type II cells, is delayed during development in fibroblasts derived from male fetuses as compared to those derived from female fetuses. The mechanism by which this delay occurs has been addressed. Pregnant rats treated in vivo with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) showed decreased FPF activity from control or cortisol-treated fibroblasts derived from 20-day-old male or female fetuses. In vitro translated proteins of size-fractionated lung RNA from 19-day-old fibroblasts that were pretreated with DHT in vitro showed decreased FPF activity compared to nontreated samples. This decreased FPF activity was present even if the DHT-pretreated cells were stimulated with cortisol prior to RNA preparation. Using a mouse model of testicular feminization that contains no receptors for androgens showed no change in the cortisol augmented FPF activity when the fibroblasts were pretreated with DHT. These data taken together suggest that the delayed FPF production of male-derived lung fibroblasts is a physiologic process which requires androgen receptors, and the mechanism by which androgens inhibit FPF production appears to affect events occurring mainly at a pretranslational level."
https://openalex.org/W1515651002,"The dynamics of water transport in proteoglycan compartments has been studied in relation to osmotic flow (proteoglycan diffusion) and hydraulic permeability (proteoglycan sedimentation) in concentrated solutions of proteoglycan subunit and native proteoglycan aggregate isolated from Swarm rat chondrosarcoma. A central parameter that describes the kinetics of both types of water movement is the hydrodynamic frictional coefficient of water with proteoglycan. The frictional coefficient is markedly concentration dependent, increasing with increasing concentration, and highlights important structural features and types of organization of the proteoglycans in concentrated solutions. These include the requirements that proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix not to be immobilized but to have translational diffusive mobility and concentration gradients to be osmotically active, that chondroitin sulfate segmental mobility describing translational motion largely determines osmotic flow and hydraulic permeability of the proteoglycans, and that the proteoglycans exhibit an enhanced ability to resist flow as compared to other macromolecules. Additional dynamic studies suggest the formation of transient super-aggregate structures may occur at high concentrations which endows the proteoglycan subunit hydrodynamic properties similar to proteoglycan aggregate."

https://openalex.org/W1566714709,"A method for the preparation of enriched plasma membranes from bovine gallbladder muscularis was developed, validated, and applied to the characterization of receptors for the gastrointestinal hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) on this target. Binding of radioiodinated CCK ligands to this preparation was rapid, reversible, temperature-dependent, saturable, and specific. Only structurally related peptides inhibited CCK binding, and good correlation existed between relative potencies for binding inhibition and for stimulating gallbladder contraction. Computer analysis of CCK-binding data using a nonlinear model-fitting program best fit a model with a single class of sites, with Kd 756 pm and binding capacity 4.5 +/- 1.3 pmol/mg of protein. This degree of enrichment for plasma membranes was adequate for the initial biochemical characterization of this CCK receptor. Affinity labeling using 125I-Bolton Hunter-CCK-33 and m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester identified proteins with Mr = 70,000-85,000, Mr = 120,000-125,000, and Mr = 200,000. Labeling was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 1 nM CCK-8, and the electrophoretic mobility of these bands was not different under reducing and nonreducing conditions. The major labeled band of Mr = 70,000-85,000 has a lower apparent Mr than that of the analogous band in pancreas labeled with similar methods, supporting the molecular heterogeneity of CCK receptors on these two target tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1542222308,"PC 12h pheochromocytoma cells were subcutaneously transplanted into rat. We found the transplanted tumors accumulated some fucogangliosides associated with PC 12 cells. These gangliosides were isolated and purified by DEAE-Sephadex A-25 and Iatrobeads column chromatographies. Their structures were determined by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, permethylation study, and sequential degradation using various exoglycosidases and mild acid hydrolysis. Two tumor-associated fucogangliosides were found to possess the blood group B determinant as follows: G6: IV2Fuc alpha, IV3Gal alpha, II3NeuAc, GgOse4Cer; G11: IV2Fuc alpha, IV3Gal alpha, II3 (NeuAc)2, GgOse4Cer. A ganglioside with the similar structure as ganglioside G6 was isolated from rat hepatoma cells (Holmes, E.H., and Hakomori, S-I. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7698-7703). However, ganglioside G11 has not previously been reported in the literature. These fucogangliosides reacted with the monoclonal antibody prepared by immunizing mice with PC 12h cells. Other fucogangliosides were also found to accumulate in the transplanted tumor tissues. They were identified as fucosyl-GM1 and fucosyl-GDlb. These fucogangliosides did not react with the monoclonal antibody against PC 12h cells."

https://openalex.org/W38425214,"Preprovasopressin-neurophysin II (prepro-AVP-Np), the precursor of the cyclic, amidated nonapeptide, arginine vasopressin (AVP), is present in the central and peripheral nervous systems, adrenal glands, and gonads of rats. To study cell-specific processing of prepro-AVP-Np, a fusion gene consisting of the heavy metal-inducible promoter of the mouse metallothionein I gene and the rat prepro-AVP-Np gene was introduced by cellular transfection into several defined cell phenotypes: a fibroblast line (BHK), a pituitary growth hormone and prolactin-producing cell line (GH4), a pituitary cell line that produces several amidated peptides (AtT-20), and an insulin-producing pancreatic islet line (RIN- 1046-38). Clonal cell lines were isolated and prepro-AVP-Np-specific transcripts were detected by Northern blot hybridization analyses. Fibroblast BHK and pituitary GH4 cells transfected with the fusion gene synthesized a polypeptide (Mr = 18,000) characteristic of the glycosylated precursor, pro-AVP-Np; in metal -treated cells, this protein was the major secreted cysteine-labeled polypeptide. Extracts of RIN-1046-38 and AtT-20 cells transfected with the fusion gene contained predominantly processed neurophysin and amidated arginine vasopressin, whereas extracts of BHK and GH4 cells contained mainly precursors of AVP and neurophysin. These observations indicate that the pathways involving specific post-translational processing of pro-AVP-Np are more efficiently utilized in the prohormone-producing AtT-20 and RIN-1046-38 cells than in GH4 and BHK cells that do not synthesize any recognized prohormones."
https://openalex.org/W1531698181,"We studied cholesterol synthesis from [14C]acetate, cholesterol esterification from [14C]oleate, and cellular cholesterol and cholesteryl ester levels after incubating cells with apoE-free high density lipoproteins (HDL) or low density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL suppressed synthesis by up to 60%, stimulated esterification by up to 280%, and increased cell cholesteryl ester content about 4-fold. Esterification increased within 2 h, but synthesis was not suppressed until after 6 h. ApoE-free HDL suppressed esterification by about 50% within 2 h. Cholesterol synthesis was changed very little within 6 h, unless esterification was maximally suppressed; synthesis was then stimulated about 4-fold. HDL lowered cellular unesterified cholesterol by 13-20% within 2 h and promoted the removal of newly synthesized cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. These changes were transient; by 24 h, both esterification and cellular unesterified cholesterol returned to control levels, and cholesteryl esters increased 2-3-fold. HDL core lipid was taken up selectively from 125I-labeled [3H]cholesteryl ester- and ether-labeled HDL. LDL core lipid uptake was proportional to LDL apoprotein uptake. The findings suggest that 1) the cells respond initially to HDL or LDL with changes in esterification, and 2) HDL mediates both the removal of free cholesterol from the cell and the delivery of HDL cholesteryl esters to the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1539553089,"Abstract The nucleotide analogue 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) reacts irreversibly with rat liver cytosolic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase kinase, causing a rapid loss of the AMP activation capacity and a slower inactivation of the catalytic activity. The rate constant for loss of AMP activation is about 10 times higher (kappa 1 = 0.112 min-1) than the rate constant of inactivation (kappa 2 = 0.0106 min-1). There is a good correspondence between the time-dependent inactivation of reductase kinase and the time-dependent incorporation of 5'-p-sulfonylbenzoyl[14C]adenosine ([14C]SBA). An average of 1.65 mol of reagent/mol of enzyme subunit is bound when reductase kinase is completely inactivated. The time-dependent incorporation is consistent with the postulate that covalent reaction of 1 mol of SBA/mol of subunit causes complete loss of AMP activation, whereas reaction of another mole of SBA/mol of subunit would lead to total inactivation. Protection against inactivation by the reagent is provided by the addition of Mg2+, AMP, Mg-ATP, or Mg-AMP to the incubation mixtures. In contrast, addition of ATP, 2'-AMP, or 3'-AMP has no effect on the rate constants. Mg-ATP protects preferentially the catalytic site against inactivation, whereas Mg-AMP at low concentration protects preferentially the allosteric site. Mg-ADP affords less protection than Mg-AMP to the allosteric site when both nucleotides are present at a concentration of 50 microM with 7.5 mM Mg2+. Experiments done with [14C]FSBA in the presence of some protectants have shown that a close correlation exists between the pattern of protection observed and the binding of [14C]SBA. The postulate is that there exists a catalytic site and an allosteric site in the reductase kinase subunit and that Mg-AMP is the main allosteric activator of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1514491637,"The relationship between the steady-state level of membrane potential (delta psi) and the rates of energy production and consumption has been studied in mitochondria and submitochondrial particles. The energy-linked reactions investigated were oxidative phosphorylation (with NADH, succinate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate as respiratory substrates) and nucleoside triphosphate-driven transhydrogenation from NADH to NADP and uphill electron transfer from succinate to NAD. Results have shown the following. 1) Attenuation of the rates of the energy-producing reactions results in a parallel change in the rates of the energy-consuming reactions with little or no change in the magnitude of steady-state delta psi. 2) At low rates of energy production and consumption, steady-state delta psi decreases. However, this is due largely to the energy leak of the system which lowers static-head delta psi when the rate of energy production is slow. 3) When the rate of energy production and static-head delta psi are held constant, and the rate of energy consumption is diminished by partial inhibition or the use of suboptimal conditions (e.g. subsaturating substrate concentrations), then even a small decrease in the rate of energy consumption results in an upward adjustment of the level of steady-state delta psi. The lower the rate of energy input, the greater the upward adjustment of steady-state delta psi upon suppression of the rate of energy consumption. 4) The above results have been discussed with regard to the role of bulk-phase delta mu H+ or delta psi in the mitochondrial energy transfer reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1542011225,"Sequence studies on the protease isoinhibitor I isolated from bovine spleen have revealed that it consists of two molecular variants which differ only in the presence of an additional COOH-terminal residue, asparagine, in the less abundant form.

The sequences correspond exactly to the 58-residue polypeptide chain of spleen isoinhibitor II plus NH2- and COOH-terminal extensions of 2 and 5 or 6 amino acid residues, respectively. Moreover the entire sequences are located within the 100-residue structure deduced from the mRNA and DNA sequences of the putative precursor. These data support the idea that the molecular variants of isoinhibitor I are either mature proteins with distinct functional roles, or intermediates in the multistage processing of the primary product of gene expression, which eventually leads to the mature protein, i.e. inhibitor II."
https://openalex.org/W1482075055,"Membrane vesicles, bearing only the influenza viral hemagglutinin glycoprotein, were reconstituted following solubilization of intact virions with Triton X-100. The viral hemagglutinin glycoprotein was separated from the neuraminidase glycoprotein by agarose sulfanilic acid column. The hemagglutinin glycoprotein obtained was homogenous in gel electrophoresis and devoid of any neuraminidase activity. A quantitative determination revealed that the hemolytic activity of the hemagglutinin vesicles was comparable to that of intact virions. Incubation of fluorescently labeled hemagglutinin vesicles with human erythrocyte ghosts (HEG) or with liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol or phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol/gangliosides, at pH 5.0 but not at pH 7.4, resulted in fluorescence dequenching. Very little, if any, fluorescence dequenching was observed upon incubation of fluorescently labeled HA vesicles with neuraminidase or glutaraldehyde-treated HEG or with liposomes composed only of phosphatidylcholine. Hemagglutinin vesicles were rendered non-hemolytic by treatment with NH2OH or glutaraldehyde or by incubation at 85 degrees C or low pH. No fluorescence dequenching was observed following incubation of non-hemolytic hemagglutinin vesicles with HEG or liposomes. These results clearly suggest that the fluorescence dequenching observed is due to fusion between the hemagglutinin vesicles and the recipient membranes. Incubation of hemagglutinin vesicles with living cultured cells, i.e. mouse lymphoma S-49 cells, at pH 5.0 as well as at pH 7.4, also resulted in fluorescence dequenching. The fluorescence dequenching observed at pH 7.4 was inhibited by lysosomotropic agents (methylamine and ammonium chloride) as well as by EDTA and NaN3, indicating that it is due to fusion of hemagglutinin vesicles taken into the cells by endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1509546890,"We have examined the interaction of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor with decidium diiodide, a bisquaternary analogue of ethidium containing 10 methylene groups between the endocyclic and trimethylamino quaternary nitrogens. Decidium inhibits mono-[125I]iodo-alpha-toxin binding, inhibits agonist-elicited 22Na+ influx in intact cells, augments agonist competition with mono-[125I]iodo-alpha-toxin binding, and enhances [3H]phencyclidine (PCP) binding to a noncompetitive inhibitor site. These effects occur over similar concentration ranges (half-maximum effects between 0.1 and 0.4 microM). Thus, decidium binds to the agonist site and converts the receptor to a desensitized state exhibiting increased affinity for agonist and heterotropic inhibitors. These properties are similar to metaphilic antagonists characterized in classical pharmacology. At higher concentrations decidium associates directly with the noncompetitive inhibitor site identified by [3H]phencyclidine binding. Dissociation constants of decidium at this site in the resting and desensitized states are determined to be 29 and 1.2 microM, respectively. Analysis of fluorescence excitation and emission maxima reveal that binding to both the agonist and noncompetitive inhibitor sites is associated with approximately 2-fold enhancement of fluorescence. The excitation maximum for decidium bound at the agonist site appears at 490 nm while that for decidium bound at the noncompetitive inhibitor site appears at 530 compared to 480 nm in buffer. These results suggest that decidium experiences a more hydrophobic environment upon binding to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor sites, particularly to the noncompetitive inhibitor site. Fluorescence energy transfer between N'-fluorescein isothiocyanate-lysine-23 alpha-toxin (FITC-toxin), and decidium is not detected when each is bound to one of the two agonist sites on the receptor. This allows a minimal distance to be estimated between fluorophores. In contrast, energy transfer is observed between decidium nonspecifically associated with the membrane or with nonspecific sites and the FITC-toxin at the agonist sites."
https://openalex.org/W1523153383,"The conformations of the gamma chain COOH terminus of intact fibrinogen and various fragments containing this region have been compared by an immunochemical analysis. Location of a major epitope in the sequence gamma 391-405 was successfully predicted from a hydrophobicity profile. An antibody population specific for the native epitope within the gamma 391-405 segment was isolated by immunoadsorption. Between 19.2 and 22.8% of antibodies were obtained from three different antisera, indicating that this region represents one of the major epitopes of native fibrinogen. Anti-gamma 391-405(N) antibodies were used to determine the value of Kconf, the equilibrium constant for the interconversion of the non-native and native conformations of this epitope. The measurements were done using native fibrinogen, fragments D1 and DD, gamma chain, and gamma 391-405. In addition, the effect of 5 M guanidine HCl on the conformation of fragments D1 and DD, which is known to abolish their antipolymerizing activity, was studied. Radioiodinated fibrinogen was used in the determination of Kconf, CI50%, and CIs (quantitative analytical parameters calculated from competitive inhibition radioimmunoassays) by measuring the competition between 125I-fibrinogen and the fibrinogen derivatives under study for binding to the immunochemically purified antibody. The measurements indicated that the epitope is unperturbed by iodination of fibrinogen and that 38.5% of fragment D1, 8.9% of fragment DD, 3.6% of the gamma chain, and less than 0.008% of the gamma 391-405 molecules adopt in aqueous solution the native conformation within the epitope. Denaturation of fragment D1 with 5 M guanidine HCl affected only slightly the conformation of this gamma chain determinant. More significant changes in the conformation were observed when fragment DD was denatured. The results suggest that long-range interactions are necessary for the stabilization of the native structure in the region of fibrinogen that interacts with the antibody and which is in close vicinity to the polymerization site, cross-linking site, and platelet recognition site."

Following a brief incubation with L-[14C] ascorbic acid and alpha-[methyl-3H]aminoisobutyric acid, cells stimulated with the nicotinic agonist 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide or by membrane depolarization with high [K+] or veratridine released newly acquired ascorbic acid (NA-ascorbate) and AIB. NA-ascorbate and endogenous catecholamines are differentially released under a variety of conditions suggesting that release of both substances cannot originate from the same subcellular compartment. In contrast, the release profile for NA-ascorbate and AIB, a putative cytosolic marker, suggest that both of these molecules are released from a cytosolic compartment. Cells permeabilized with the detergent digitonin release catecholamines only in the presence of external Ca2+, whereas release of NA-ascorbate and AIB is Ca2+-independent and time- and detergent concentration-dependent. If the osmolality of the external medium is made either hyper- or hypoosmotic, 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide-induced release of endogenous catecholamines is inhibited. Release of NA-ascorbate and AIB, however, is progressively inhibited with increasing osmolality and enhanced with decreasing osmolality. Furthermore, differential release of NA-ascorbate and AIB as compared to soluble acetylcholinesterase, which is apparently released form the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum, was also observed. To determine the mechanism by which NA-ascorbate and AIB are released from the cell, the requirements for their maximal release were investigated. Release of NA-ascorbate and AIB was sensitive to inhibitors (both metabolic and transport) and to changes in the external ionic environment. The metabolic inhibitors carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and KCN (when incubated simultaneously with 2-deoxyglucose) inhibited NA-ascorbate and AIB release by greater than 75%. In contrast, the Na+-K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain enhanced veratridine-induced release of NA-ascorbate by nearly 100% and had an even greater effect on AIB release. Changes in the external ionic environment (i.e. Na+ and/or Cl- substitution) inhibited both NA-ascorbate and AIB release to varying degrees. Substitution of Cl- by various anions inhibited NA-ascorbate and AIB release to a much greater degree than endogenous catecholamine release. Complete substitution of NaCl with sucrose inhibited release of NA-ascorbate and AIB release by greater than 80%, while Na+ substituted with Li+ inhibited release of all three molecules by about 50%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Specifically the following tryptamine analogs at 1 mM concentration were shown to enhance the protein C activation rate relative to a control with no added effector at pH 8.3 (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, 37 degrees C): serotonin, 1.2; tryptamine, 2.9; 5-fluorotryptamine, 4.4; 6-fluorotryptamine, 7.2. At much higher levels, e.g. 10 mM, all of the above effectors, as well as indole, showed a moderate inhibition of human protein C activation. ATP, a platelet release product, showed a sigmoidal inhibition pattern similar to that found previously for thrombin amidase, clotting, and esterase activity (Conery, B.G., and Berliner, L.J. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 369-375). Overall, the enhancement factors for human alpha-thrombin activation of protein C with the tryptamine analogs described above were remarkable when considering the effect of a simple ligand versus the natural activator, thrombomodulin."

The reaction of 2 SH residues/dimer resulted in formation of an oligomeric species of Mr = 100,000 detectable by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The subunits crosslinked via a disulfide bond are dissociated by addition of 2-mercaptoethanol which also restores full catalytic activity. The substrate α-ketoglutarate prevents inactivation of the enzyme by iodosobenzoate and the subsequent formation of one disulfide bond. It is postulated that the catalytic site of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase is situated in a deep cleft at the subunit interface."
