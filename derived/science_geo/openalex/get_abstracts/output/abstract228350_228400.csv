https://openalex.org/W2111412754,"Three human coronaviruses are known to exist: human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), HCoV-OC43 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Here we report the identification of a fourth human coronavirus, HCoV-NL63, using a new method of virus discovery. The virus was isolated from a 7-month-old child suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis. The complete genome sequence indicates that this virus is not a recombinant, but rather a new group 1 coronavirus. The in vitro host cell range of HCoV-NL63 is notable because it replicates on tertiary monkey kidney cells and the monkey kidney LLC-MK2 cell line. The viral genome contains distinctive features, including a unique N-terminal fragment within the spike protein. Screening of clinical specimens from individuals suffering from respiratory illness identified seven additional HCoV-NL63-infected individuals, indicating that the virus was widely spread within the human population."
https://openalex.org/W2056607803,"Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is a dominant progressive disorder that maps to chromosome 9p21.1-p12. We investigated 13 families with IBMPFD linked to chromosome 9 using a candidate-gene approach. We found six missense mutations in the gene encoding valosin-containing protein (VCP, a member of the AAA-ATPase superfamily) exclusively in all 61 affected individuals. Haplotype analysis indicated that descent from two founders in two separate North American kindreds accounted for IBMPFD in approximately 50% of affected families. VCP is associated with a variety of cellular activities, including cell cycle control, membrane fusion and the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway. Identification of VCP as causing IBMPFD has important implications for other inclusion-body diseases, including myopathies, dementias and Paget disease of bone (PDB), as it may define a new common pathological ubiquitin-based pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2167638513,"Aberrant WNT pathway signaling is an early progression event in 90% of colorectal cancers. It occurs through mutations mainly of APC and less often of CTNNB1 (encoding beta-catenin) or AXIN2 (encoding axin-2, also known as conductin). These mutations allow ligand-independent WNT signaling that culminates in abnormal accumulation of free beta-catenin in the nucleus. We previously identified frequent promoter hypermethylation and gene silencing of the genes encoding secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) in colorectal cancer. SFRPs possess a domain similar to one in the WNT-receptor frizzled proteins and can inhibit WNT receptor binding to downregulate pathway signaling during development. Here we show that restoration of SFRP function in colorectal cancer cells attenuates WNT signaling even in the presence of downstream mutations. We also show that the epigenetic loss of SFRP function occurs early in colorectal cancer progression and may thus provide constitutive WNT signaling that is required to complement downstream mutations in the evolution of colorectal cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2064569583,"Over 7 million people worldwide die annually from erratic heart rhythms (cardiac arrhythmias), and many more are disabled. Yet there is no imaging modality to identify patients at risk, provide accurate diagnosis and guide therapy. Standard diagnostic techniques such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) provide only low-resolution projections of cardiac electrical activity on the body surface. Here we demonstrate the successful application in humans of a new imaging modality called electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI), which noninvasively images cardiac electrical activity in the heart. In ECGI, a multielectrode vest records 224 body-surface electrocardiograms; electrical potentials, electrograms and isochrones are then reconstructed on the heart's surface using geometrical information from computed tomography (CT) and a mathematical algorithm. We provide examples of ECGI application during atrial and ventricular activation and ventricular repolarization in (i) normal heart (ii) heart with a conduction disorder (right bundle branch block) (iii) focal activation initiated by right or left ventricular pacing, and (iv) atrial flutter."
https://openalex.org/W2025331295,"The biochemical, biophysical, and physiological properties of the PsbS protein were studied in relation to mutations of two symmetry-related, lumen-exposed glutamate residues, Glu-122 and Glu-226. These two glutamates are targets for protonation during lumen acidification in excess light. Mutation of PsbS did not affect xanthophyll cycle pigment conversion or pool size. Plants containing PsbS mutations of both glutamates did not have any rapidly inducible nonphotochemical quenching (qE) and had similar chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime components as npq4-1, a psbS deletion mutant. The double mutant also lacked a characteristic leaf absorbance change at 535 nm (ΔA535), and PsbS from these plants did not bind dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), a known inhibitor of qE. Mutation of only one of the glutamates had intermediate effects on qE, chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime component amplitudes, DCCD binding, and ΔA535. Little if any differences were observed comparing the two single mutants, suggesting that the glutamates are chemically and functionally equivalent. Based on these results a bifacial model for the functional interaction of PsbS with photosystem II is proposed. Furthermore, based on the extent of qE inhibition in the mutants, photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching processes of photosystem II were associated with distinct chlorophyll fluorescence life-time distribution components.

Furthermore, based on the extent of qE inhibition in the mutants, photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching processes of photosystem II were associated with distinct chlorophyll fluorescence life-time distribution components. In conditions of excess light, photosynthetic light harvesting is regulated by a feedback de-excitation mechanism termed energy-dependent quenching (qE), 1The abbreviations used are: qE, rapidly inducible, pH- and xanthophyll-dependent component of NPQ; A, antheraxanthin; Chl, chlorophyll; DCCD, N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; NPQ, nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence; PSII, photosystem II; V, violaxanthin; Z, zeaxanthin; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. which increases thermal dissipation of excess absorbed light energy in photosystem II (PSII). The qE mechanism is triggered by conditions that limit photosynthetic carbon fixation and result in increased acidification of the chloroplast thylakoid lumen (1Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 2Gilmore A.M. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 99: 197-209Crossref Google Scholar, 3Niyogi K.K. Annu.

Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (2124) Google Scholar). The thermal dissipation of excess excitation energy is most commonly measured and referred to as nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) of PSII chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence. Although there are several components of NPQ, in higher plants qE can account for the major part of NPQ and is characterized by its relatively fast induction and relaxation kinetics, on a physiological time scale of seconds to minutes. The decrease in the intensity of Chl fluorescence is the result of the decrease in the electronic excited state lifetime of Chl caused by an increased thermal dissipation rate constant (5Gilmore A.M. Hazlett T.L. Govindjee Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2273-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The rapid response of the qE process is chemically associated with changes in the trans-thylakoid membrane pH gradient (ΔpH). The ΔpH change has at least two functions in qE. First, it activates the violaxanthin de-epoxidase that converts violaxanthin (V) to antheraxanthin (A) and zeaxanthin (Z) (6Yamamoto H.Y. Nakayama T.O. Chichester C.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 97: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). A and/or Z are essential elements of qE (7Demmig-Adams B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 1-24Crossref Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 8Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 35: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 9Niyogi K.K. Grossman A.R. Björkman O. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1121-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Second, the lower pH in the lumen results in protonation of PSII proteins, including the 22-kDa PSII subunit, PsbS, which plays a key role in qE (10Li X.-P. Björkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). When both pH-induced changes occur together it is believed that Chls in PSII can transfer their excess energy to Z, which can return to the ground state via thermal decay (7Demmig-Adams B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 1-24Crossref Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 11Frank H.A. Cua A. Chynwat V. Young A. Gosztola D. Wasielewski M.R. Photosynth.

A. 2003; 100: 4377-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The pH-sensing mechanism of the PsbS protein is influenced by two pairs of symmetrically arranged glutamate residues, each located within or close to the two lumen-exposed loops of the protein (13Li X.-P. Phippard A. Pasari J. Niyogi K.K. Funct. Plant Biol. 2002; 29: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), a well known inhibitor of qE (14Ruban A.V.

Biochem. 1994; 226: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) is a carboxylate-modifying agent (17Azzi A. Casey R.P. Nalecz M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that binds to PsbS (18Dominici P. Caffarri S. Armenante F. Ceoldo S. Crimi M. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22750-22758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although it was suggested that the DCCD binding site is in the lumenal loops of PsbS, the exact binding site has not been determined. Importantly, site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicated that two of the PsbS glutamates, Glu-122 and Glu-226, are necessary for the function of PsbS (13Li X.-P. Phippard A. Pasari J. Niyogi K.K. Funct. Plant Biol. 2002; 29: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this article we used single and double mutations of PsbS (E122Q/E226Q) to make a detailed biochemical and biophysical analysis of the role of these two glutamates in pH sensing and DCCD binding. We probed the role of the Glu-122 and Glu-226 residues by monitoring the changes in the PSII Chl a fluorescence lifetime distributions, intensities, and photochemical efficiencies. Additionally, we also monitored the absorbance change at 535 nm (ΔA535) (19Heber U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 180: 302-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) that is obligatorily associated with qE (10Li X.-P. Björkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 20Bilger W. Björkman O. Thayer S.S. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 542-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bilger W. Björkman O. Planta. 1994; 193: 238-246Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The ΔA535 has been suggested to reflect a red shift in the absorption spectrum of Z that occurs upon binding to PsbS (22Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7785-7789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Aspinall-O'Dea M. Wentworth M. Pascal A. Robert B. Ruban A. Horton P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16331-16335Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). From these measurements we formulated a model of the influence of the glutamate mutants on the fractional quenching of the populations of PSII (24Gilmore A.M. Shinkarev V.P. Hazlett T.L. Govindjee Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13582-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) that is consistent with the symmetrical structure of the PsbS protein, the DCCD binding stoichiometry, and the stoichiometry of the xanthophyll components on a per PSII unit basis. Plant Materials and Growth Conditions—Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia strain) was used in all experiments. npq4-1 is a psbS deletion mutant (10Li X.-P. Björkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of psbS and transformation protocols were the same as described previously (13Li X.-P. Phippard A. Pasari J. Niyogi K.K. Funct. Plant Biol. 2002; 29: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the T1 generation, lines with single insertions were selected, and homozygous lines were confirmed in the T3 generation. All plants were grown in a growth chamber with a light intensity of 120 μmol photons m–2 s–1 and a photoperiod of 10 h light (22 °C)/14 h dark (20 °C). DNA and Immunoblotting—psbS DNA gel blotting and PsbS protein immunoblotting analyses were performed as described previously (13Li X.-P. Phippard A. Pasari J. Niyogi K.K. Funct. Plant Biol. 2002; 29: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), except that genomic DNA was digested with SpeI. NPQ Measurement—Room temperature Chl fluorescence was measured on the attached rosette leaves with a commercial fluorometer (FMS2, Hansatech, King's Lynn, United Kingdom). Plants were dark-adapted overnight before the measurement. After measuring Fm during a 1.0-s saturating pulse of 10,000 μmol photons m–2 s–1, actinic light of 1200 μmol photons m–2 s–1 was switched on for 10 min. A saturating 1.0-s pulse of 10,000 μmol photons m–2 s–1 was triggered every 60 s to determine F′m. NPQ was calculated as (Fm−F′m)/F′m. Cross-linking and Immunoblot Analysis—Fresh thylakoids were extracted from mature rosette leaves (24Gilmore A.M. Shinkarev V.P. Hazlett T.L. Govindjee Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13582-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thylakoids containing 50 nmol of Chl were diluted in 1 ml of reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 0.1 m sucrose, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1mm KH2PO4, 30mm sodium ascorbate, 50 μm methyl viologen, 0.3 mm ATP) and stirred in the dark or under qE-inducing illumination. After 10 min, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm and stirred for 10 min. Cross-linking was terminated with the addition of Tris-HCl (pH 8) to 20 mm and stirring for an additional 10 min. The cross-linked thylakoids were centrifuged for 2 min at 15,300 × g and resuspended with protein solubilization buffer without reductant for analysis by SDS-PAGE. For immunoblotting of cross-linked samples, 5 nmol of Chl was loaded in each lane. Xanthophyll Cycle Pigment Analysis—For zeaxanthin formation experiments, leaf discs were sampled from overnight dark-adapted plants as controls, sampled at noon in the growth chamber (low light conditions), and sampled at noon, floated on water, and then treated at 1600 μmol photons m–2 s–1 for 30 min (high light-treated). All samples were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until analysis. Pigments were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (25Müller-Moulé P. Conklin P.L. Niyogi K.K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 970-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and the mean ± S.D. was calculated (n = 6–9). Leaf Absorbance Measurements—Leaf absorbance changes were measured using the Non-Focusing Optics Spectrophotometer (NoFOSpec) (26Sacksteder C.A. Jacoby M.E. Kramer D.M. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 70: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but modified as described (27Avenson T. Cruz J.A. Kramer D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5530-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) to allow semi-simultaneous measurements of absorbance changes at four different wavelengths. This was accomplished by aiming four separate banks of light-emitting diodes (HLMP-CM15, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), each filtered through a separate 5-nm band-pass interference filter (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT), into the entrance of a compound parabolic concentrator. Each bank of light-emitting diodes was filtered with a separate interference filter, at 500, 520, 535, and 545 nm each with a 5-nm band pass (full width at half-height). The photodiode detector was protected from direct actinic light by a Schott BG-18 filter. Current from the photodiode was converted to a voltage by an operational amplifier, and the resulting signal was AC-filtered to remove background signals, and sampled by a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter on a personal computer data acquisition card (DAS16/16-AO, Measurement Computing, Middleboro, MA). Timing pulses were generated by digital circuitry (PC card D24/CTR 3, Measurement Computing, Middleboro, MA) controlled by software developed in-house. The duration of the probe pulses was set at 10 μs. Actinic illumination was provided by a set of 12 red light-emitting diodes (HLMP-EG08-X1000, Agilent Technologies) and controlled by the timing circuitry. Measuring pulses at each wavelength were given in sequence at 1–100-ms intervals, depending upon the experiment. Chl a fluorescence changes were also measured with the NoFOSpec instrument using the 525-nm measuring pulse to excite Chls, while protecting the detector with a Schott RG-9 filter (28Sacksteder C.A. Kanazawa A. Jacoby M.E. Kramer D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14283-14288Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Leaves were cut from plants dark-adapted overnight, and the leaf petiole was wrapped in a small piece of moist cotton. The Fm was first recorded by giving 800 ms white light of 30,000 μmol photons m–2 s–1. After 30 s in the dark, a red actinic light of 1300 μmol photons m–2 s–1 was switched on for 215 s, and the leaf absorption at 535 nm was recorded. After allowing relaxation of qE in the dark for 110 s, leaf absorption at 535 nm was recorded again, and the ΔA535 was calculated. After finishing the 535-nm measurement, the same actinic light was switched on again for 2 min, and then a white light pulse (800 ms, 30,000 μmol photons m–2 s–1) was applied to measure the F′m. DCCD Binding Analysis—[14C]DCCD labeling was conducted on thylakoids prepared as described previously (29Bassi R. Rigoni F. Barbato R. Giacometti G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 29-38Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) at two different pH conditions, pH 7.8 and 5, for 3 h at room temperature. For labeling at pH 7.8, thylakoid samples containing 30 μg of Chl were labeled in buffer T2 (5 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 50 mm sorbitol, 10 mm EDTA). For labeling at pH 5, thylakoid samples were labeled in citrate buffer (30 mm sodium citrate, pH 5, 50 mm sorbitol, 10 mm EDTA). After mixing thylakoids with buffer, 7.5 μlof100 μm [14C]DCCD (0.5 μCi) in ethanol was added to make a final total volume of 100 μl. For gel analysis, a first dimension separation using a 12% acrylamide Tris sulfate gel with 6 m urea was used (30Bassi R. Machold O. Simpson D. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1985; 50: 145-162Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After staining the gel with Coomassie Blue, the region corresponding to PsbS and light-harvesting complex proteins was cut out and equilibrated in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, with 2% (w/v) SDS for 25 min, then transferred to the same buffer containing 60% glycerol for another 10 min. The gel slice was then loaded for second dimension separation by SDS-PAGE on a 10–16% gel without urea (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The labeling intensities of PsbS mutants with respect to the wild type were acquired from the dried gels with the Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.) instrument and calculated from the average of three independent measurements after correcting for the quantity of PsbS on the SDS-PAGE. Room Temperature Chl Fluorescence Lifetime Measurement—Leaf samples were dark-adapted for 12 h at room temperature prior to detachment at the petiole and complete vacuum infiltration of the intercellular airspace with 0.35 m glucose (30 min in dimmed room light at room temperature) in a 5-ml disposable syringe. Infiltrated leaves were gently pressed using cotton wool into a front surface configuration free of air bubbles in a low-fluorescence plastic-quartz cuvette submerged in 0.35 m glucose solution. The samples were placed in an aluminum block-type sample holder that could be temperature controlled using circulating water baths. After dark adaptation for 10 min at 20 °C the samples were illuminated, and Chl a fluorescence was monitored using the fiber-optic probe of a Chl fluorometer (PAM 101–103, Heinz-Walz Instruments Ltd., Effeltrich, Germany). Experiments were initiated at 20 °C with the low-intensity modulated measuring beam (1.6 KHz, ≈0.25 μmol photons m–2 s–1, 440 nm) to measure the PSII fluorescence intensity (interference filter 685 nm, 10-nm bandpass) under conditions of maximal photochemistry (Fo). After 30 s Fm was measured during a saturating 2-s pulse of white light (13,600 μmol photons m–2 s–1, Walz DT-Cyan filter), and then a strong actinic white light (1250 μmol photons m–2 s–1, Walz DT-Cyan filter) was applied to induce photosynthetic electron transport, thylakoid lumen acidification, V de-epoxidation, and PsbS protonation. Saturating pulses were applied every 60 s to measure F′m. After 10 min the sample temperature was reduced to 3 °C (requiring ∼3 min after switching water baths), whereas the actinic light was continued for a total of 15 min. All illumination was extinguished, and the sample was then rapidly turned to face the fiber-optic probe of the fluorescence lifetime instrument to illuminate the sample (140 μmol photons m–2 s–1, 635 nm) for 5 min before initiating the fluorescence lifetime determination. Fluorescence lifetime determinations were made under conditions of light- and low temperature (3 °C)-saturated lumen acidification (32Gilmore A.M. Björkman O. Planta. 1995; 197: 646-654Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to maintain maximal levels of V de-epoxidation and PsbS protonation, whereas the PSII redox state was ∼60–80% reduced, depending on the level of energy dissipation (33Li X.-P. Müller-Moulé P. Gilmore A.M. Niyogi K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15222-15227Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity conditions during the lifetime acquisition corresponded to those defined as Fs (34van Kooten O. Snel J.F.H. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 25: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). The PSII Chl a fluorescence lifetimes were determined using a multifrequency phase-modulation fluorimeter (model K2–004, ISS Instruments, Urbana, IL) using a red laser diode (peak emission 635 nm) for excitation and a red-sensitive microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan; R3809U-50) for emission detection. Excitation and emission were applied and measured, respectively, from the front surface of the sample using a bifurcated quartz fiber-optic probe with the single terminus facing the sample. The excitation diode-laser intensity was attenuated to 140 μmol photons m–2 s–1 at 30 MHz to avoid photobleaching during measurements, which normally required 10 min to complete. The reference and sample signals were detected at each modulation frequency using high transmittance (>80%) narrow waveband (12 nm half-width) interference filters (Corion Inc., Franklin, MA) centered at 645 and 689 nm, respectively. An automatic rotating filterwheel exchanged the sample and reference positions such that the phase and modulation signals were repeatedly determined using 4–6 cycles at each modulation frequency until standard errors were reduced below 0.04 degrees for the phase angle shift and 0.001 for the demodulation ratios. Global Analysis of the Phase and Modulation Fluorescence Lifetime Data—The phase angle shift and demodulation ratio data sets for all samples were analyzed globally by fitting to a multimodal Lorentzian distribution model with the τ-center value and width of each fractional component being linked together and all amplitudes free-floating. Similar to the analysis described previously (33Li X.-P. Müller-Moulé P. Gilmore A.M. Niyogi K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15222-15227Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), a minimum of five positive and one negative amplitude components were necessary to fit the data from all sample types globally. The goodness of fit for the data set, which included 62 free fitting parameters and 404 data points, was judged on the following criteria: the residual error distribution was randomly and normally distributed around 0 after minimizing the reduced χ-square to a value of 2.0223 using frequency-independent standard deviation values σphase shift = 0.25° and σdemodulation = 0.005 (35Gilmore A.M. Papageorgiou G.C. Govindjee Chlorophyll Fluorescence: A Signature of Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2004Google Scholar). Global analysis was performed on a program assembled with Excel 2002, Visual Basic (Microsoft) and Large-Scale GRG Solver Engine (Frontline Systems, Inc., Incline Village, NV). The program was evaluated by using statistical reference datasets provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. 2Available at math.nist.gov. Effect of Glutamate Mutations on PsbS Function and qE— Glutamate residues in the lumenal loops of PsbS were changed to glutamines by site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate H+-binding capacity while minimizing alteration of the protein structure (13Li X.-P. Phippard A. Pasari J. Niyogi K.K. Funct. Plant Biol. 2002; 29: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The E122Q and E226Q mutations were made individually and pairwise and expressed in npq4-1 Arabidopsis plants that lack endogenous wild-type PsbS. As a control, npq4-1 plants were transformed with the wild-type psbS gene. For each single mutant (npq4-E122Q and npq4-E226Q), the double mutant (npq4-E122Q,E226Q), and the control (npq4-1 + psbS), two to three independent lines carrying single insertions were selected (Fig. 1A). Immunoblot analysis showed that PsbS protein levels in all transgenic lines were 3–5-fold higher than in wild-type plants (Fig. 1). Immunoblotting was conducted on washed thylakoid membranes, demonstrating that the PsbS protein was inserted in the membrane in all cases. Furthermore, protein cross-linking experiments with isolated thylakoids showed no differences in PsbS cross-linking patterns (data not shown), indicating that the glutamate mutations of PsbS and enhanced protein expression level do not affect the physical association of PsbS within the thylakoid membranes or its interaction with other proteins. Fig. 2 shows the NPQ induction traces in the transgenic lines, the wild type, and npq4-1. Compared with the npq4-1 + psbS lines, which had higher levels of NPQ than the wild type because of overexpression of PsbS (33Li X.-P. Müller-Moulé P. Gilmore A.M. Niyogi K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15222-15227Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), the single mutant lines had about one-third as much NPQ. Most of the NPQ was rapidly reversible (qE). There was no significant difference between the single mutant lines npq4-E122Q and npq4-E226Q. The NPQ level in the npq4-E122Q,E226Q double mutant lines was indistinguishable from that of npq4-1, which lacks qE, indicating that the double mutant PsbS was nonfunctional. Xanthophyll Cycle Pigment Composition and ΔA535—There were no significant differences in either the total xanthophyll cycle pigment pool sizes or V de-epoxidation states in high light (1700 μmol photons m–2 s–1) in any of the different lines sampled at the same conditions (data not shown). The xanthophyll cycle pool size was 26.5 ± 0.8, 28.2 ± 0.9, and 29.6 ± 1.2 mmol/mol Chl a in the three sample conditions, and the respective de-epoxidation states were 0.053 ± 0.010 in overnight dark-adapted leaves, 0.068 ± 0.010 in leaves sampled at noon under growth light conditions, and 0.649 ± 0.010 in leaves treated for 30 min with light that was 10 times higher than the growth light. Thus, we conclude that neither the amount of PsbS in the thylakoid membrane, as shown before (33Li X.-P. Müller-Moulé P. Gilmore A.M. Niyogi K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15222-15227Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 36Li X.-P. Gilmore A.M. Niyogi K.K. J. Biol.

Fig. 3A shows that ΔA535 was linearly correlated with the extent of NPQ in each sample. There was a significant x intercept value of about 0.36, indicating that a small component of the total NPQ is independent of ΔA535 and PsbS. This component is attributable to qI, a component of NPQ that is related to photoinhibitory damage to PSII and associated with a slowly reversing component of Fm quenching that is observed in the absence of PsbS, as discussed in more detail below. We further analyzed the linear relationship between ΔA535 and NPQ by consolidating the variations of the sampling in each measurement and plotting the lines for the mean values of NPQ and ΔA535 from the wild type, npq4-1, npq4-1 + psbS, npq4-E122Q, npq4-E226Q, and npq4-E122Q,E226Q lines (Fig. 3B). This analysis increased the significance of the slope and intercept values (Table I). There were no significant differences between npq4-1 and the double mutant or between the npq4-E122Q and npq4-E226Q single mutants.Table IStatistical analysis of the results in Fig. 3Slopep ValueInterceptp ValueAdjusted r2Data from Fig. 3A8.249 ± 0.3732.916E-19-3.024 ± 0.5912.029E-050.9438Data from Fig. 3B8.288 ± 0.2162.752E-06-2.997 ± 0.2995.56E-040.997 Open table in a new tab DCCD Binding—DCCD binds to carboxylate residues in hydrophobic environments (17Azzi A.

PsbS purified from spinach or Arabidopsis and PsbS expressed in Escherichia coli bind DCCD at pH 7.5. Three acidic residues in each of the two lumen-exposed loops were suggested to be the possible binding sites (18Dominici P. Caffarri S. Armenante F. Ceoldo S. Crimi M. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22750-22758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that, in thylakoids isolated from wild-type Arabidopsis, DCCD bound to PsbS at pH 5. However, no binding of DCCD was detected at pH 7.8 (data not shown). DCCD binding was only 45 ± 10 and 50 ± 12% of the control in the npq4-E122Q and npq4-E226Q single mutants, respectively, and binding was undetectable in the npq4-E122Q,E226Q double mutant (Fig. 4). These results indicate that DCCD can equally bind to Glu-122 and Glu-226 and that mutation of one of the glutamates does not affect the chemical characteristics of the other in a cooperative manner. Chl a Fluorescence Lifetimes—We further analyzed the Chl a fluorescence lifetime distributions in these mutants. Fig. 5A shows the phase shift and demodulation ratio data as a function of modulation frequency (symbols) and the globally fit model (lines), with the residual errors in the lower panel.

Scanning of genomic DNA from individuals with heart failure and rhythm disturbances due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy identified two mutations in ABCC9, which encodes the regulatory SUR2A subunit of the cardiac K(ATP) channel. These missense and frameshift mutations mapped to evolutionarily conserved domains adjacent to the catalytic ATPase pocket within SUR2A. Mutant SUR2A proteins showed aberrant redistribution of conformations in the intrinsic ATP hydrolytic cycle, translating into abnormal K(ATP) channel phenotypes with compromised metabolic signal decoding. Defective catalysis-mediated pore regulation is thus a mechanism for channel dysfunction and susceptibility to dilated cardiomyopathy."

https://openalex.org/W2132606798,"Melatonin, the secretory product of the pineal gland, is known to be neuroprotective in cerebral ischemia, which is so far mostly attributed to its antioxidant properties. Here we show that melatonin directly inhibits the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP). mtPTP contributes to the pathology of ischemia by releasing calcium and cytochrome c (cyt c) from mitochondria. Consistently, NMDA-induced calcium rises were diminished by melatonin in cultured mouse striatal neurons, similar to the pattern seen with cyclosporine A (CsA). When the mouse striatal neurons were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), melatonin strongly prevented the OGD-induced loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. To assess the direct effect of melatonin on the mtPTP activity at the single channel level, recordings from the inner mitochondrial membrane were obtained by a patch-clamp approach using rat liver mitoplasts. Melatonin strongly inhibited mtPTP currents in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.8 microM. If melatonin is an inhibitor of the mtPTP, it should prevent mitochondrial cyt c release as seen in stroke models. Rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h followed by reperfusion. Melatonin (10 mg/kg ip) or vehicle was given at the time of occlusion and at the time of reperfusion. Indeed, infarct area in the brain sections of melatonin-treated animals displayed a considerably decreased cyt c release along with less activation of caspase-3 and apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Melatonin treatment diminished the loss of neurons and decreased the infarct volume as compared with untreated MCAO rats. Our findings suggest that the direct inhibition of the mtPTP by melatonin may essentially contribute to its anti-apoptotic effects in transient brain ischemia."

In this report we demonstrate that both the dosS gene adjacent to dosR and another gene, dosT (Rv2027c), encode sensor kinases, each of which can autophosphorylate at a conserved histidine and then transfer phosphate to an aspartate residue of DosR.

Am. Rev. Tuberc. 1946; 53: 297-305PubMed Google Scholar). The causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), kills about 2 million people annually making it a leading cause of infectious death worldwide (2Bloom B.R. Small P.M. N. Engl. J.

Assoc. 1999; 282: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar). The success of MTB as a pathogen is closely linked with its capacity to persist for years or decades in humans in the absence of any clinical disease symptoms. Current estimates place the number of people latently infected with MTB at nearly 2 billion, or one-third of the Earth's population (3Dye C. Scheele S. Dolin P. Pathania V. Raviglione M.C. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 282: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar, 4Enarson D.A. Murray J.F. Rom W.N. Garay S. Tuberculosis. Little, Brown and Co., Boston1996: 55-75Google Scholar). Eradicating this enormous reservoir of latently infected carriers is complicated by several factors, including the availability, cost, and length of drug therapy required for successful treatment of latent TB. Although TB has been studied for centuries, the triggers that promote and maintain latent infections are still obscure. Two conditions frequently associated with latent TB in vivo are reduced oxygen tension and nitric oxide (NO) exposure (5Wayne L.G. Sohaskey C.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 139-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 6Nathan C. Shiloh M.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8841-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Both of these stimuli can induce reversible bacterial stasis in vitro (7Wayne L.G. Infect. Immun. 1977; 17: 528-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Voskuil M.I. Schnappinger D. Harrell M.I. Visconti K.C. Dolganov G. Sherman D.R. Schoolnik G.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), and both are encountered by bacilli in vivo (5Wayne L.G. Sohaskey C.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 139-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 9Choi H.S. Rai P.R. Chu H.W. Cool C. Chan E.D. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Springer Publishing Co., New York1955: 111-126Google Scholar). Further, although MTB requires oxygen for growth, it can survive without oxygen for surprisingly long periods of time (11Corper H.J. Cohn M.L. Am. Rev. Tuberc. 1933; 28: 856-874Google Scholar, 12Wayne L.G. Lin K.Y. Infect. Immun. 1982; 37: 1042-1049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Still the evidence linking hypoxia and NO to latent TB in vivo remains circumstantial. Analysis of the MTB response to these factors is needed to define the role they may play in promoting and maintaining TB latency in humans. Previous reports identified a set of 47 MTB genes that are rapidly up-regulated in response to reduced oxygen tension or NO (8Voskuil M.I. Schnappinger D. Harrell M.I. Visconti K.C. Dolganov G. Sherman D.R. Schoolnik G.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 13Sherman D.R. Voskuil M. Schnappinger D. Liao R. Harrell M.I. Schoolnik G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7534-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Among the MTB genes induced by hypoxia or exposure to NO is the putative two-component regulatory system dosR-dosS (also called devR-devS, Rv3133c/Rv3132c 2Genes are denoted both by name and the designation assigned by the TubercuList Web site: genolist.pasteur.fr/TubercuList/.2Genes are denoted both by name and the designation assigned by the TubercuList Web site: genolist.pasteur.fr/TubercuList/.) (8Voskuil M.I. Schnappinger D. Harrell M.I. Visconti K.C. Dolganov G. Sherman D.R. Schoolnik G.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 13Sherman D.R. Voskuil M.

In bacteria, two-component response regulator systems are an important means by which a variety of environmental signals are transduced into a phenotypic response. These systems typically consist of a membrane-bound sensor kinase and soluble response regulator that is activated by a histidine-aspartate phosphorelay to bind upstream of specific genes and alter their expression (14Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Crossref Google Scholar). We hypothesized that dosR and dosS may form a signaling system involved in the initial adaptation of bacilli to conditions within the host (13Sherman D.R. Voskuil M. Schnappinger D. Liao R. Harrell M.I. Schoolnik G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7534-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). We showed previously that DosR binds upstream of hypoxic response genes (15Park H.D. Guinn K.M. Harrell M.I. Liao R. Voskuil M.I. Tompa M. Schoolnik G.K. Sherman D.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Further, nearly all MTB genes rapidly up-regulated in response to low doses of NO (8Voskuil M.I. Schnappinger D. Harrell M.I. Visconti K.C. Dolganov G. Sherman D.R. Schoolnik G.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) or by hypoxia require DosR for their induction (15Park H.D. Guinn K.M. Harrell M.I. Liao R. Voskuil M.I. Tompa M. Schoolnik G.K. Sherman D.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that DosS (Rv3132c) is a functional kinase of the two-component class and that it can transfer phosphate to DosR in vitro. We show that a second putative kinase, DosT (Rv2027c), also phosphorylates DosR. We demonstrate that mutants lacking both DosS and DosT can no longer activate DosR-dependent MTB gene expression in response to reduced oxygen tension. Targeted Gene Inactivation—Inactivation of the dosS gene was performed by gene replacement as described previously (13Sherman D.R. Voskuil M. Schnappinger D. Liao R. Harrell M.I. Schoolnik G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7534-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the dosT gene also was by gene replacement. We amplified a portion of the wild type gene by PCR using mutagenic primers that introduced three in-frame stop codons and a PacI site for screening and eliminated the putative histidine phosphorylation site (primers RPL8 to RPL11; see Table I). The 952-bp PCR product then was cloned into the vector pKO2 containing a hygromycin resistance marker and a sacB counters-election marker. The resulting plasmid then was electroporated into MTB isolates H37Rv and H37Rv:ΔdosS. Homologous recombination and gene replacement was detected stepwise using hygromycin resistance followed by sacB counterselection and loss of hygromycin resistance as described previously (13Sherman D.R. Voskuil M. Schnappinger D. Liao R. Harrell M.I. Schoolnik G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7534-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Gene replacement was confirmed by PCR using mutagenic and wild type dosT-specific primers along with primers specific for sequences flanking the site of integration (RPL12 and RPL13; see Table I) (data not shown). Digestion of the resulting amplicons with PacI also was performed to confirm the PCR screen results (data not shown).Table IPrimer sequences Primers used in the experiments are listed with sequences and a brief description (see text for details).

In three separate experiments transformants were grown in 7H9 medium in triplicate to an A600 of 0.3-0.4. 0.5 ml of each culture was removed to 13-ml tubes, which were sealed tightly with rubber septa. 0.2% O2 was infused through an 18-gauge needle for 30 s, and tubes then were incubated on a rotator for 2 h at 37 °C. Promoter activity was measured by combining a 100-μl aliquot of MTB isolate culture with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) in the wells of a 96-well plate, and incubation was continued for 5 min at room temperature. Luciferase activity was measured using a TD2020 luminometer. dosT Complementation—For complementation studies, a pMH108-based construct was developed in which dosT is driven by mycobacterial optimal promoter (19George K.M. Yuan Y. Sherman D.R. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The dosT upstream region was amplified using primers DMR28 and DMR29 (see Table I). This construct was electroporated into H37Rv, H37Rv:ΔdosS, H37Rv:ΔdosT, and H37Rv:ΔdosS: ΔdosT with the DNA integrating into the MTB chromosome at the L5 phage attachment site. Luciferase reporter activity was measured as indicated above. Cloning and Expression of dosS and dosT Genes—Full-length dosS and dosT were PCR-amplified from H37Rv genomic DNA using the primers DMR005 to DMR008 (see Table I) and were cloned into the pET32 Ek/LIC vector (Novagen). In addition, dosS and dosT mutants encoding amino acid substitutions DosS (H395K/H397K) and DosT (H392K/H394K) were generated by mutagenic fusion PCR with primers DMR024 to DMR027 (see Table I) and were cloned into pET32 Ek/LIC. Recombinant proteins were overexpressed as S-Tag fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and localized within inclusion bodies. The proteins were extracted from the inclusion bodies using the protein refolding kit from Novagen. Briefly, E. coli cells were disrupted using the BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen), and inclusion bodies were recovered by centrifugation. After several washes in dilute BugBuster reagent, the inclusion bodies were solubilized in 500 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, supplemented with 0.3% N-lauroylsarcosine. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing the proteins was dialyzed at 4 °C against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. After several dialysis buffer changes, dithiothreitol was omitted, and final overnight dialysis was performed in the presence of oxidized and reduced glutathione (1 and 0.2 mm, respectively) to promote proper protein folding. Samples were concentrated using Centricon Plus-20 spin filters (Amicon). Cloning and Expression of DosR and DosR (D54E) Mutant—The plasmids pDosR and pDosR (D54E) were obtained by insertion of the wild type DosR and the DosR (D54E) mutant coding sequences (15Park H.D.

The Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen) and the BL21-Gold(DE3) (Stratagene) E. coli strains were used as hosts for plasmids pDosR and pDosR (D54E), respectively. Cells were grown in LB media with 100 mg/liter ampicillin (with additional 34 mg/liter chloramphenicol for cells containing plasmid pDosR (D54E)) at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6 and then were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Growth was continued for 3 h at 30 °C after induction. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C and stored at -80 °C before use. DosR and DosR (D54E) Protein Purification—Cell pellets containing wild type DosR and DosR (D54E) mutant were resuspended in 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and were lysed by French press. Protamine sulfate was added, and the lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 40 min, and the supernatant was clarified by filtration and then was applied to a nickelnitrilotriacetic acid affinity column. The nonspecifically bound proteins were eluted with 30 mm imidazole in 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. DosR and DosR (D54E) mutant were eluted from the column with 200 mm imidazole in the same buffer. Protein fractions were pooled and dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm tri[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine hydrochloride. The proteins then were purified by cation exchange chromatography using a 20HS column (PerSeptive Biosystems) and were eluted with 50 mm to 1 m NaCl gradient. Peak fractions were combined and concentrated using Amicon Centriplus spin concentrators. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—4 μg of the recombinant S-Tag fusion protein DosT or DosT (H392K/H394K) was assayed for the ability to autophosphorylate in a reaction mixture containing 50 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl2 in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. 4-μl aliquots were removed from the autophosphorylation reaction at 0 and 60 min and were stopped with the addition of an equal volume of SDS-PAGE (Laemmli) buffer and immediate immersion in a dry ice/EtOH bath. An additional 4-μl aliquot (800 ng) was removed and added to reactions containing 4 μg of either recombinant DosR or DosR (D54E) in the same reaction buffer as above (excluding isotope) for a final volume of 20 μl. 4-μl aliquots were removed for analysis at 0, 30 s, 1 min, 5 min, and 30 min. All aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were exposed to film overnight at -80 °C. Studies with DosS and DosS (H395K/H397K) were performed in the same manner except that a 10-μl aliquot (2 μg) was carried over from the autophosphorylation reaction to the reaction containing either wild type or mutant DosR, and membranes were exposed to film for 72 h at -80 °C. Western Analysis—All blots were screened first with HRP-conjugated S-protein (Novagen), which binds the S-Tag with high affinity, at a 1:5000 dilution. ECL analysis was performed with exposure times varying from 1 to 10 s. Blots were then stripped in 200 mm glycine, pH 2.5, 0.2% Tween 20 followed by incubation in HRP color substrate to confirm loss of signal. The blots were rescreened with rabbit anti-rDosR polyclonal IgG antibody at a 1:5000 dilution followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce), and ECL analysis was performed again. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the palindromic consensus promoter sequence of hypoxic response genes (15Park H.D. Guinn K.M. Harrell M.I. Liao R. Voskuil M.I. Tompa M. Schoolnik G.K. Sherman D.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) was used as a DNA probe. The binding of DosR and DosR (D54E) was carried out by incubation at room temperature for 30 min in 10 μl of reaction mixtures composed of 12.5 μm DNA, 25 μm protein, 24 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2 in the presence or absence of the phosphate donor lithium potassium acetyl phosphate (20 mm). Following incubation the entire reaction volume was electrophoresed in a 15% non-denaturing Tris borate EDTA polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). The gel was stained with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized with a 312 nm transilluminator (Fisher Scientific). Sensor Kinase Mutagenesis—Two-component response regulators activate gene transcription following phosphorylation by a sensor kinase (14Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Crossref Google Scholar). When the putative phosphorylation site of the regulator DosR is mutated, it no longer activates transcription of the MTB genes normally induced under hypoxic conditions (15Park H.D. Guinn K.M. Harrell M.I. Liao R. Voskuil M.I. Tompa M. Schoolnik G.K. Sherman D.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). DosS is an obvious candidate to carry out the phosphorylation and activation of DosR. The dosS gene is adjacent to dosR in the genome, is co-transcribed, and is predicted to encode a sensor kinase (13Sherman D.R. Voskuil M. Schnappinger D. Liao R. Harrell M.I. Schoolnik G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7534-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 20Dasgupta N. Kapur V. Singh K.K. Das T.K. Sachdeva S. Jyothisri K. Tyagi J.S. Tuber. Lung Dis. 2000; 80: 141-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, the role of the putative kinase and its interaction with DosR was unclear as targeted deletion of dosS had little effect on the ability of DosR to activate gene transcription (13Sherman D.R. Voskuil M. Schnappinger D. Liao R. Harrell M.I. Schoolnik G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7534-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), and disruption of dosS had relatively little effect on survival under hypoxic conditions (21Boon C. Dick T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6760-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These results led to speculation that a second putative sensor kinase gene in the MTB genome with homology to DosS, DosT (Rv2027c), may complement the function of DosS (13Sherman D.R. Voskuil M. Schnappinger D. Liao R. Harrell M.I. Schoolnik G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7534-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 20Dasgupta N. Kapur V. Singh K.K. Das T.K. Sachdeva S. Jyothisri K. Tyagi J.S. Tuber. Lung Dis. 2000; 80: 141-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To assess the role of the putative histidine sensor kinases DosS and DosT in the phosphorylation of DosR, we targeted these genes for deletion. The dosS gene was inactivated in isolate H37Rv by gene replacement as reported previously (13Sherman D.R. Voskuil M. Schnappinger D. Liao R. Harrell M.I. Schoolnik G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7534-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). We then inactivated the dosT gene in both H37Rv and H37Rv: ΔdosS. A mutated copy of dosT was inserted that contained premature stop codons, introduced a PacI restriction site, and lacked the sequence encoding the histidine-containing putative signaling region. Confirmation of the dosT gene replacement was determined by performing PCR on transformants and amplicon digestion with PacI (data not shown). Effects of Sensor Kinase Gene Mutagenesis—One of the MTB genes powerfully induced under hypoxic conditions is acr (also called Rv2031c or hspX) encoding an α-crystallin-like heat shock protein (13Sherman D.R. Voskuil M. Schnappinger D. Liao R. Harrell M.I. Schoolnik G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7534-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 22Yuan Y. Crane D.D. Barry III, C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4484-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The acr promoter contains two high affinity DosR binding sequences (15Park H.D. Guinn K.M. Harrell M.I. Liao R. Voskuil M.I. Tompa M. Schoolnik G.K. Sherman D.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 23Florczyk M.A. McCue L.A. Purkayastha A. Currenti E. Wolin M.J. McDonough K.A. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5332-5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Mutation of these sequences abolished DosR binding and resulted in dramatically reduced levels of expression (15Park H.D. Guinn K.M. Harrell M.I. Liao R. Voskuil M.I. Tompa M. Schoolnik G.K. Sherman D.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). To determine the roles of DosS and DosT, both wild type and mutant bacteria were transformed with plasmid pMH108 in which the acr promoter is fused upstream of the firefly luciferase (luc) reporter gene. Isolates were subjected to hypoxic conditions, and levels of luciferase activity were measured (Fig. 1). In the wild type strain H37Rv, luc gene expression was induced about 115-fold (Fig. 1). In both the H37Rv:ΔdosS and H37Rv:ΔdosT mutants luc induction was reduced to 40-45% of wild type values. When both dosS and dosT genes were inactivated, reporter gene expression levels dropped to base-line values, indicating that DosR no longer is able to activate transcription (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that both DosS and DosT are required for full activation of DosR under conditions of reduced oxygen tension. dosT Complementation Analyses—To determine whether the interruption of reporter gene expression was caused by the targeted disruption of dosS and dosT, we restored a functional dosT gene to the mutants H37Rv:ΔdosS, H37Rv:ΔdosT, and H37Rv:ΔdosS:ΔdosT. The wild type dosT gene was PCR-amplified and cloned into the reporter construct pMH108 under the control of the constitutive mycobacterial optimal promoter. Each MTB isolate was transformed with the pMH108:dosT complementation constructs, incubated under hypoxic conditions, and tested for luciferase activity (Fig. 1). When dosT was reintroduced into each isolate, reporter gene expression was restored to levels comparable with or greater than those observed with wild type H37Rv, indicating that loss of hypoxic responsiveness in the mutants was caused by the lack of an appropriate sensor kinase. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—The first steps in two-component signal transduction are generally signal recognition by the sensor kinase followed by dimerization and autophosphorylation at a specific His residue (14Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Crossref Google Scholar). Once autophosphorylated, the kinase transfers the phosphate to a second protein, the response regulator. We utilized recombinant DosS, DosT, and DosR in an in vitro phosphorylation assay to determine whether they functioned as a two-component system. In addition to testing wild type proteins, mutant DosS and DosT were generated via mutagenic fusion PCR. The mutations encoded amino acid substitutions intended to disrupt the histidine kinase phosphorylation motifs, giving rise to DosS (H395K/H397K) and DosT (H392K/H394K). Recombinant proteins were overexpressed in E. coli as S-Tag fusion proteins. The production of the recombinant S-Tag proteins and their purification from inclusion bodies was verified via SDS-PAGE Coomassie Blue staining and Western analysis with S-protein HRP conjugate (data not shown). In both instances a protein slightly larger than the 75-kDa marker was detected, corresponding to the molecular mass of both DosS and DosT (∼62 kDa) fused to the 16-kDa S-Tag. First we analyzed whether DosT had the ability to autophosphorylate and then transfer the phosphate to DosR. DosT was incubated at room temperature with 50 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, and aliquots of the reaction were removed for analysis at 0 and 60 min. An additional aliquot from the autophosphorylation reaction was removed at 60 min and put into a relay reaction containing purified DosR. Aliquots of the relay reaction were removed at 0, 0.5, 1, 5, and 30 min. The aliquots from both reactions were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 2). The DosT (H392K/H394K) mutant also was analyzed for its ability to autophosphorylate in the same manner. The autoradiograph of the blot corresponding to the DosT autophosphorylation/phosphorelay reaction is shown in Fig. 2A. By 60 min a radiolabeled protein was detected consistent with the predicted ∼78-kDa DosT fusion protein size. Upon transfer to the relay reaction, this same protein was observed at time 0, but the radiolabel in this band waned with time until it was barely detectable at 30 min. In contrast, a radiolabeled protein consistent with the 26-kDa size of DosR was barely detectable at time 0 of the phosphorelay reaction yet became more intense as the 30-min mark approached, indicating that phosphotransfer is occurring between the two proteins. To confirm the identity of the differentially labeled proteins, immunoblot analyses were performed with an S-protein HRP conjugate to detect DosT (Fig. 2B) and after stripping with an anti-DosR antibody (Fig. 2C). Reactivity with the anti-DosR antibody was observed only in the phosphorelay lanes with the radiolabeled 26-kDa protein confirming its identity as DosR, whereas reactivity with the S-protein HRP conjugate was observed with the radiolabeled protein at ∼78 kDa confirming it as DosT. The additional bands in Fig. 2 also reacted with the S-protein HRP conjugate indicating that they are truncated forms of DosT that no longer have the ability to transfer phosphate (data not shown). When the DosT (H392K/H394K) mutant replaced the wild type DosT in the assay, there was no detectable autophosphorylation after 60 min and thus no subsequent phosphate transfer to DosR (data not shown). In addition, no labeling was observed in control phosphotransfer reactions from which DosT was omitted (data not shown), demonstrating that labeling of DosR was caused by phosphotransfer from DosT as opposed to DosR autophosphorylation. To determine whether the phosphorelay proceeded in a m"

Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P. Clark-Lewis I. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Binding to the GAG chains of cell surface proteoglycans is thought to facilitate the formation of high localized concentrations of chemokines, which in turn provide directional signals for leukocyte migration. To understand the molecular details of the chemokine-GAG interaction, in the present study we identified the GAG binding epitopes of MCP-1/CCL2 by characterizing a panel of surface alanine mutants in a series of heparin-binding assays. Using sedimentation equilibrium and cross-linking methods, we also observed that addition of heparin octasaccharide induces tetramer formation of MCP-1/CCL2. Although MCP-1/CCL2 forms a dimer in solution, both a dimer and tetramer have been observed by x-ray crystallography, providing a glimpse of the putative heparin-bound state. When the GAG binding residues are mapped onto the surface of the tetramer, the pattern that emerges is a continuous ring of basic residues encircling the tetramer, creating a positively charged surface well suited for binding GAGs. The structure also suggests several possible functional roles for GAG-induced oligomerization beyond retention of chemokines at the site of production.

The structure also suggests several possible functional roles for GAG-induced oligomerization beyond retention of chemokines at the site of production. Chemokines are small 8-10-kDa proteins that control the migration of specific leukocyte populations during inflammatory responses, hematopoeisis, and routine immune surveillance. They exert their biological effects by binding to seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors on leukocytes, triggering changes in the cytoskeleton and in adhesive interactions with the extracellular matrix and cell surfaces to produce locomotion (2Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar, 3Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar, 4Rossi D. Zlotnik A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar). Inflammatory chemokines can also stimulate further cellular activation, resulting in destructive processes such as lysosomal enzyme release, generation of toxic products from the respiratory burst, and apoptosis (5Baggiolini M. Kernen P. Deranleau D.A. Dewald B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Control over cell populations that are mobilized from the vasculature is determined in large part by the specific chemokines that are secreted and the corresponding receptors that are expressed on the migrating cells. To date, 45 human chemokines and 18 receptors have been discovered. They segregate into four families (CXC, CC, CX3C, and C) based on the pattern of cysteine residues in the ligands (6Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). They can be further classified as either inducible chemokines, which are expressed as a consequence of physiological stress and inflammation (7D'Ambrosio D. Panina-Bordignon P. Sinigaglia F. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 273: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), or as constitutive chemokines which are the homeostatic ligands responsible for routine leukocyte trafficking and developmental processes (8Kunkel E. Butcher E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 512: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 9Butcher E.C. Picker L.J. Science. 1996; 272: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). In general, many chemokines bind multiple receptors and many receptors bind multiple chemokines, creating the potential for combinatorial diversity in their functions. Traditionally, the overlapping receptor-binding capacity of chemokines has been perceived as redundant (10Mantovani A. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 254-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). However, there is mounting evidence that different chemokines interacting with the same receptor may activate different sets of signaling pathways, leading to finely tuned cellular responses (11Devalaraja M.N. Richmond A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 151-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, some chemokines act as agonists of some receptors and antagonists of others (12Dairaghi D.J. Fan R.A. McMaster B.E. Hanley M.R. Schall T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21569-21574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 13Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Brauner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol.

In addition to chemokine G protein-coupled receptor interactions, chemokines bind both to soluble glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) 1The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; WT, wild type; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; IFT, isothermal fluorescence titration. (16Wagner L. Yang O.O. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Ge Y. Kalams S.A. Walker B.D. Pasternack M.S. Luster A.D. Nature. 1998; 391: 908-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) as well as GAGs immobilized on cell surfaces and the extracellular matrix (17Rot A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that chemokine immobilization through the GAG interaction facilitates the formation of haptotactic chemokine gradients and enhances their concentration at the site of production, particularly in the presence of shear forces in blood vessels and draining lymph nodes. Interaction with GAGs may also provide another level of specificity and control to cell migration, beyond that defined by receptor engagement, by selective binding of certain chemokines to different types of GAGs and their diverse isoforms (18Kuschert G.S.V.

Biol. 1994; 4: 394-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Structurally, GAGs are linear polysaccharides containing repeating disaccharide sequences that vary in composition, N- and O-sulfation patterns, and linkage, thus leading to an enormous level of diversity (22Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 391-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar, 23Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The most common GAGs are heparan sulfate, heparin (a highly sulfated form of heparan sulfate), chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid. With the exception of hyaluronic acid and heparin, GAGs are normally covalently attached to membrane bound “core” proteins, although these proteoglycans can also be processed, releasing small fragments that can have either inhibitory or activating functions (24Sasisekharan R. Shriver Z. Venkataraman G. Narayanasami U. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The presence of carboxylate and sulfate groups on the GAG chains gives rise to an overall negative charge and facilitates the interaction with chemokines, which are predominantly basic proteins. The importance of the GAG interaction is supported by the fact that chemokines bind to purified glycosaminoglycans in vitro (25Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S. Proudfoot A.E. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I.

Cell. 1997; 91: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Removal of GAGs by glycosidase treatment also causes a marked reduction in chemokine binding to receptor bearing cells (25Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S. Proudfoot A.E. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I. Power C.A. Wells T.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that GAG binding was essential for the ability of MCP-1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, and MIP-1β/CCL4 to promote cell migration in vivo (1Proudfoot A.E.I. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P. Clark-Lewis I. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). This result was demonstrated with GAG-binding deficient mutants of these chemokines that had near-wild type function in chemotaxis assays in vitro; however, they could not induce cell migration in an in vivo intraperitoneal recruitment assay. In parallel, we also explored the functional relevance of chemokine oligomerization to migration in vivo, since it has been shown that although many chemokines form dimers, oligomerization is not required for receptor binding and chemotaxis in vitro (28Paavola C.D. Hemmerich S. Grunberger D. Polsky I. Bloom A. Freedman R. Mulkins M. Bhakta S. McCarley D. Wiesent L. Wong B. Jarnagin K. Handel T.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3401-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, using monomeric variants of the same chemokines, we demonstrated that oligomerization is required for in vivo cell recruitment (1Proudfoot A.E.I. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P. Clark-Lewis I. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). We also showed that binding to GAGs induces oligomerization of RANTES/CCL5, suggesting that the in vivo requirements for GAG binding and oligomerization are functionally coupled. In the present study, we explored the structural details of the interaction of MCP-1/CCL2 with the GAG heparin. By characterizing a panel of MCP-1/CCL2 mutants in several assays of heparin binding, we defined the GAG binding hotspots on MCP-1/CCL2. We also further investigated the relationship between GAG binding and oligomerization of MCP-1/CCL2 using sedimentation equilibrium and cross-linking experiments. Combining these data with previous crystallographic results supports a structural model of the MCP-1-heparin interaction. The structure suggests several ways in which GAGs could provide an additional level of fine control to chemokine function. Materials—Unfractionated heparin was purchased from Sigma. Size-defined heparin oligosaccharides were from Neoparin, Inc. (San Leandro, CA). Tritiated heparin was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Production of Chemokines—MCP-1/CCL2 mutant expression constructs were made in the context of MCP-1 M64I, which will be referred to as wild type (WT). It has been demonstrated that M64I behaves identically to WT in binding and activity assays (31Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Freedman R. Grunberger D. Krstenansky J. Lee S. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Pease J. Mizoue L. Mirzadegan T. Polsky I. Thompson K. Handel T.M. Jarnagin K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13013-13025Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The gene was constructed by standard gene synthesis techniques with optimal codon usage for expression in Escherichia coli as previously described (28Paavola C.D. Hemmerich S. Grunberger D. Polsky I. Bloom A. Freedman R. Mulkins M. Bhakta S. McCarley D. Wiesent L. Wong B. Jarnagin K. Handel T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33157-33165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Mutant plasmids were generated by a two-step PCR protocol or by the QuikChange method (Stratagene). After verification by sequencing, plasmids were transformed into TAP302 cells. Cell growth, protein expression and protein purification were carried out as previously described (28Paavola C.D. Hemmerich S. Grunberger D. Polsky I. Bloom A. Freedman R. Mulkins M. Bhakta S. McCarley D. Wiesent L. Wong B. Jarnagin K. Handel T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33157-33165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). If needed, proteins were subsequently treated with aminopeptidase (Peprotech, Rock Hill, NJ) to remove the initiating methionine and repurified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. For all experiments except sedimentation equilibrium and cross-linking, or unless otherwise indicated, the initiating methionine was removed. Electrospray mass spectrometry was used to confirm the expected mass of the mutants. In Vitro Heparin Binding Assays—Several assays were used to identify the GAG binding site on MCP-1. As an initial screen, the amount of salt required to elute WT and mutant MCP-1 from a heparin-Sepharose column was determined as previously described (32Kuschert G.S.V. Hoogewerf A.J. Proudfoot A.E.I. Chung C.W. Cooke R.M. Hubbard R.E. Wells T.N.C. Sanderson P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11193-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), with a few minor modifications. Briefly, 1 ml of 10 μm protein (in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5) was injected onto a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose column (Bio-Rad Econopac) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 3 ml/min in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, using a NaCl gradient from 0 to 1 m over 30 min. The gradient was monitored using a conductivity meter, calibrated such that 0 and 1 m NaCl corresponded to 0 and 100% conductivity, respectively. This assay was performed at least three times for each mutant. To measure the contribution of various residues to the specificity of the interaction, the amount of salt required to elute mutants from a nonspecific S-Sepharose column (Bio-Rad Econopac) was also determined using the same protocol and compared with the elution from the heparin-Sepharose column. The specificity index is related to ΔΔNaCl as calculated from the formula below, where the subscripts H and S refer to elution from the heparin-Sepharose or S-Sepharose column, respectively (32Kuschert G.S.V. Hoogewerf A.J. Proudfoot A.E.I. Chung C.W. Cooke R.M. Hubbard R.E. Wells T.N.C. Sanderson P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11193-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), ΔΔ[NaCl]=Δ[NaCl]H−Δ[NaCl]S(Eq. 1) where Δ[NaCl]H = [NaCl]H WT - [NaCl]H mutant and Δ[NaCl]S = [NaCl]S WT - [NaCl]S mutant. As an independent screen of the GAG binding affinity of the various mutants, a tritiated heparin binding assay was employed (1Proudfoot A.E.I. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P. Clark-Lewis I. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In contrast to the Sepharose assays, which are biased toward electrostatic interactions, this assay is thought to reflect the overall binding capacity of a given protein. The assay was done by incubating increasing concentrations of chemokine with [3H]heparin (50 ng/ml) in 96-well filter plates for 1 h at 37 °C. The solutions were transferred to 96-well plates fitted with Whatman cellulose phosphate filters and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline under vacuum. After the addition of 50 μl of scintillant, the radioactivity was counted. Measurements were made at least in triplicate for all mutants. Finally, to determine apparent affinities, a solution-based isothermal fluorescence assay was carried out (33Goger B. Halden Y. Rek A. Mosl R. Pye D. Gallagher J. Kungl A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1640-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Unfractionated porcine mucosal heparin (average molecular mass = 15 kDa) was titrated into a 1 μm solution of chemokine dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, and the change in fluorescence emission of the single tryptophan residue (Trp59) was measured. Measurements were made on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorimeter using excitation and emission wavelengths of 282 and 340 nm, respectively, and a 290-nm cut-off filter. The binding isotherms were analyzed by nonlinear regression to an equation describing a bimolecular association reaction. We describe the resulting number as an apparent affinity because of the assumptions made in the curve fitting to a bimolecular reaction, when changes in aggregation state seem to be occurring (see below). Peritoneal Cell Recruitment—An in vivo peritoneal cell recruitment assay was performed as previously described (1Proudfoot A.E.I. Handel T.M. Johnson Z. Lau E.K. LiWang P. Clark-Lewis I. Borlat F. Wells T.N.C. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8-12-week-old female Balb/c mice (Janvier, Le Genest St. Isle, France) were injected intraperitoneally with 200 μl of sterile NaCl (0.9%, lipopolysaccharide free) or with 10 μg of chemokine diluted in the same buffer. At 18 h postinjection, mice were sacrificed, the peritoneal cavity was washed, the lavage was pooled, and the cells were counted with a hemocytometer. Sedimentation Equilibrium Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation experiments were performed on a Beckman Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge at speeds of 20,000-30,000 rpm at 25 °C. All proteins were prepared at a concentration of 6 μm (the lowest concentration that gave reasonable data) in 10 mm K2PO4, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and premixed with specific molar ratios of heparin saccharide (protein/saccharide = 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, and 1:2). Size-defined heparin oligosaccharides ranging from tetrasaccharide to dodecasaccharide, as well as unfractionated heparin, were used in these experiments. Unless indicated otherwise, the MCP-1 in these experiments contained the initiating methionine. Protein concentrations were determined from the extinction coefficient (34Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) and molecular weight specific to each mutant. Six-channel cells were scanned every hour, at 226 nm, where none of the saccharides absorb. Samples were deemed at equilibrium when the last three scans superimposed, usually in about 10-16 h, and data were collected in five replicates with step size of 0.001 cm. Data analysis was performed using the Beckman/Microcal Origin version 4.0 software package (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) based on the Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm. Data from each run was first fit to the ideal noninteracting single-species model, Ar=A0exp(HM(r2−r02))+E(Eq. 2) H=(1−∇ρ)ω22RT(Eq. 3) where Ar represents the absorbance at radius r, A0 is the absorbance at reference radius r0, ρ is the solvent density, ▿ is the partial specific volume, ω is the angular velocity of the rotor, M is the apparent monomer molecular weight of the solute, and E is the base-line offset. Each data set was then successively fit to monomer-dimer, monomer-tetramer, monomer-octamer, monomer-dimer-tetramer, monomer-tetramer-octamer, and dimer-tetramer-octamer self-association models, where the monomer molecular weight was fixed, and association constants for the relevant oligomeric species were allowed to vary according to the following equation. Ar=exp(lnA0+HM(r2−r02))+exp(n2lnA0+lnKa,2+Hn2M(r2−r02))+exp(n3lnA0+lnKa,3+Hn3M(r2−r02))+E(Eq. 4) Here the stoichiometries n2 and, if relevant to the particular model, n3, are defined by the user to describe monomer-n-mer, or monomer-n2-mer-n3-mer equilibria. Ka,2 is the association constant for the assembly reaction of n2 monomers; likewise, Ka,3 is the association constant for the assembly of n3 monomers. Time-dependent aggregation was noted if the absorbance at the midpoint of overlaid spectra decreased during the course of a run. The monomeric mass used for the MCP-1-GAG complex was the sum of the protein monomer and the saccharide, normalized by stoichiometry and assuming 100% association. The partial specific volume of each MCP-1 mutant was determined from amino acid composition according to the method of Cohn and Edsall (35Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids, and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Rheinhold, New York1943Crossref Google Scholar). The partial specific volume of the MCP-1-GAG complex was calculated as a mass-weighted average of the partial specific volume of MCP-1 (0.737 ml/g) and heparin (0.47 ml/g) (36Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), assuming 100% association. The solvent density was assumed to be 1.00 g/ml. The quality of the fit was characterized by the variance and by examination for systematic deviation of the residuals. Chemical Cross-linking of MCP-1-Saccharide Complexes—Cross-linking between MCP-1 and heparin oligosaccharides was performed with minor modifications of the zero-length two-step procedure (37Vives R.R. Sadir R. Imberty A. Rencurosi A. Lortat-Jacob H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14779-14789Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 38Pye D.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13456-13461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 39Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The main advantage to this method is that only protein and saccharide in direct contact with each other should be cross-linked, since there is no spacer. 200 μm size-defined heparin was first activated with 6 mm 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 15 mmN-hydroxysulfosuccinimide in 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl to convert some of the saccharide carboxyl groups into succinimide esters. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 25 °C for 1 h, at which time it was quenched with 2-mercaptoethanol (20 mm final). Twenty min after quenching, 25 μg of MCP-1 was added in the same buffer to allow activated saccharide to react with primary amine and lysine ϵ-amino groups of the protein, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 25 °C (final concentration = 25 μm protein and 100 μm oligosaccharide). Laemmli buffer was then added to each sample, and samples were electrophoresed on a 12% Tris-Tricine gel. Cross-linked products were detected by silver stain. Identification of the GAG Binding Site on MCP-1—Twenty-two single alanine mutants were generated to define the GAG binding site of MCP-1. To ensure that the mutations did not induce structural perturbations, only residues with solvent-accessible surface areas exceeding 30% were mutated. For all single point mutants that had reduced receptor binding affinity, we had previously recorded 1H-15N HSQC spectra to demonstrate structural integrity (28Paavola C.D. Hemmerich S. Grunberger D. Polsky I. Bloom A. Freedman R. Mulkins M. Bhakta S. McCarley D. Wiesent L. Wong B. Jarnagin K. Handel T.M. J. Biol.

In the present study, we also recorded 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the key double mutant R18A/K19A (discussed below). For this mutant, as for the others, chemical shift changes are localized to the vicinity of the mutation. Thus, all of the mutants discussed in this paper appear structurally unperturbed (see Supplemental Material for comparison of the WT spectra and that of R18A/K19A). The mutants were then characterized in a number of in vitro GAG binding assays using heparin as a representative GAG. Although heparin has been found as a cell surface proteoglycan (40Stringer S.E. Mayer-Proschel M. Kalyani A. Rao M. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25455-25460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it is not the most physiologically relevant GAG with respect to surface localization. However, it is thought to be structurally and chemically similar enough to the more ubiquitous cell surface heparan sulfate to serve as a good prototype for initial investigations. In fact, almost all known GAG-binding proteins interact with the highly sulfated “S domains” of heparan sulfate, justifying its use. Furthermore, chemokine binding to extracellular matrix and other structures has been shown to correlate strongly with the avidity of binding to heparin in vitro (41Koopmann W. Krangel M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10103-10109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We used four different assays of heparin binding to obtain the most reliable definition of the MCP-1 GAG binding epitopes. The first assay involved quantifying the concentration of NaCl required to elute chemokine from a heparin Sepharose column. The contribution of a particular residue was estimated by the decrease in [NaCl] required to disrupt heparin binding for each mutant relative to WT (Δ[NaCl]H). Whereas WT MCP-1 eluted at 546 ± 10 mm NaCl, R18A, K19A, R24A, and K49A showed decreased affinity, eluting at 387 ± 8, 448 ± 6, 414 ± 8, and 453 ± 7 mm, respectively (Fig. 1a, Table I), suggesting that these residues constitute the primary GAG binding site. No other basic residues showed a significant effect, including Lys58 and His66, residues previously reported to be critical for GAG binding (42Chakravarty L. Rogers L. Quach T. Breckenridge S. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29641-29647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Other variants in the panel of mutants included a monomeric variant, P8A, and the mutant Y13A, whose ability to dimerize is greatly destabilized compared with WT MCP-1 (28Paavola C.D. Hemmerich S. Grunberger D. Polsky I. Bloom A. Freedman R. Mulkins M. Bhakta S. McCarley D. Wiesent L. Wong B. Jarnagin K. Handel T.M. J. Biol.

These variants exhibited a small decrease in affinity for heparin, revealing a contribution of oligomerization to GAG binding affinity.Table ISummary of Sepharose affinity data for MCP-1 mutants and Kd values determined from isothermal fluorescence titrations For the IFT data, only Kd < 10 μm could be determined.

ALS2 encodes a large protein termed alsin, which contains a number of predicted cell signaling and protein trafficking sequence motifs. To gain insight into the overall function of alsin and to begin to evaluate its role in motor neuron maintenance, we examined the subcellular localization of alsin and the biochemical activities associated with its individual subdomains. We found that the Vps9p domain of alsin has Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange activity. In addition, alsin interacted specifically with and acted as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1. Immunofluorescence and fractionation experiments in both fibroblasts and neurons revealed that alsin is a cytosolic protein, with a significant portion associated with small, punctate membrane structures. Many of these membrane structures also contained Rab5 or Rac1. Upon overexpression of full-length alsin, the overexpressed material was largely cytosolic, indicating that the association with membrane structures could be saturated. We also found that alsin was present in membrane ruffles and lamellipodia. These data suggest that alsin is involved in membrane transport events, potentially linking endocytic processes and actin cytoskeleton remodeling.

Chronic ethanol consumption causes liver damage by a complex process thought to involve oxidative and nitrosative stress, hypoxia, up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, and defects in energy metabolism (1Arteel G.E.

These responses are also accompanied by a profound increase in the sensitivity of the respiratory chain to inhibition by NO, which we propose plays a key role in contributing to the hypoxia associated with ethanol-dependent hepatotoxicity (17Venkatraman A. Shiva S. Davis A.J. Bailey S.M. Brookes P.S. Darley-Usmar V. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). While mechanisms responsible for ethanol-induced mitochondrial dysfunction have been investigated, the impact of chronic ethanol consumption on the overall content of mitochondrial proteins, the “mitochondrial proteome,” has not been studied. Earlier studies by Cunningham and colleagues (18Coleman W.B. Cunningham C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Coleman W.B. Cunningham C.C.

It is proposed that the inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis following chronic ethanol exposure is due to defects in mtDNA (20Cahill A. Wang X. Hoek J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biophys. 2002; 398: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the mitochondrial proteome involves over 100 proteins as components of oxidative phosphorylation, most of which are encoded by the nuclear genome. Little or no information is available on the effects of ethanol on these nuclear encoded proteins, and because they are thought to play an important regulatory role in mitochondrial function this is potentially important in understanding the basis of mitochondrial pathologies. Indeed the mechanisms by which chronic ethanol alters the mitochondrial genome or levels of other mitochondrial proteins and the role that these changes may play in the development of liver injury from chronic ethanol exposure are not known. Ethanol-dependent hepatotoxicity, particularly in the early stages that precede cirrhosis, is then an ideal model to examine the response of the mitochondrial proteome in an organ exposed to a metabolic stress.Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is the central tool for proteomic analysis.

While conventional two-dimensional IEF/SDS-PAGE is well suited to identify changes in the levels of the more hydrophilic proteins of the mitochondrion, e.g. matrix proteins, analysis of membrane proteins is hampered by the fact that many of these proteins precipitate at the basic end of the IEF gels and are thus poorly resolved on conventional two-dimensional gels (26Lopez M.F.

Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 950-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, alternate protein separation techniques are required to define changes in the levels of membrane proteins. To address this issue we used the two-dimensional blue native (BN)-PAGE technique developed by Schagger and von Jagow (29Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar, 30Schagger H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 555-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and modified by Brookes and colleagues (31Brookes P.S. Pinner A. Ramachandran A. Coward L. Barnes S. Kim H. Darley-Usmar V.M. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) to complement our two-dimensional gel analyses of the mitochondrial proteome. Using this approach changes in the levels of both mitochondrial and nuclear encoded proteins that comprise the respiratory complexes following chronic ethanol consumption can be assessed. Moreover because the first dimension BN-PAGE is done under non-denaturing conditions information regarding protein-protein interactions and the assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes is retained. This is particularly important because it will enable probing the molecular basis of the observation that chronic ethanol consumption decreases the functioning of the oxidative phosphorylation system (12Cunningham C.C. Coleman W.B. Spach P.I. Alcohol Alcohol. 1990; 25: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13Hoek J.B. Curr. Top. Bioenerg. 1994; 17: 197-241Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar).In this investigation, global alterations in mitochondrial protein levels and mtDNA damage were studied in a well characterized rodent model of chronic ethanol feeding (32Lieber C.S. DeCarli L.M. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1982; 6: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) that is known to cause hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction (12Cunningham C.C. Coleman W.B. Spach P.I.

Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1318-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 33Baraona E. Zeballos G.A. Shoichet L. Mak K.M. Lieber C.S. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 2002; 26: 883-889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the early stage of the disease process. Using both the proteomic approaches described above, alterations in the levels of proteins involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids and the oxidative phosphorylation system were found in mitochondria isolated from the livers of rats chronically exposed to ethanol. Moreover significant liver mtDNA damage was detected in response to ethanol consumption. This result is important because it demonstrates that ethanol exposure alters the mitochondrial genome during the very early stages of ethanol-induced liver injury, i.e. fatty liver stage, in young animals. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic ethanol initiates reactions that induce mtDNA damage, which in turn negatively impacts mitochondrial protein synthesis and functioning of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Furthermore the results from these proteomic analyses reveal that although the response of liver to chronic ethanol exposure is a complex process the number of changes in proteins is limited to a specific group of metabolic pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Lieber-DeCarli ethanol and control liquid diets were purchased from Bio-Serv (Frenchtown, NJ). Immobiline pH gradient strips, ampholytes, and molecular weight standards were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Monoclonal antibodies specific for complex I iron-sulfur protein 5 and 7, complex III subunit I, complex IV subunit I, and ATP synthase α and β subunits were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other biochemicals were obtained from Sigma or Bio-Rad.Animals and Diets—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 g) were individually housed in suspended cages and maintained under a 12-h light/dark cycle for the entire duration of the feeding protocol. Nutritionally adequate ethanol and control liquid diets were formulated and prepared according to Lieber and DeCarli (32Lieber C.S. DeCarli L.M. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1982; 6: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The ethanol diet provides 36% of the total daily caloric intake as ethanol, 11% as carbohydrate, 18% as protein, and 35% as fat. Weight-matched control rats were pair-fed and received identical diets except that ethanol calories were substituted isocalorically by dextrin maltose. Animals were maintained on the diets for at least 31 days as described previously (5Bailey S.M. Cunningham C.C. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1318-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These studies were approved by the local institutional animal care and use committee.Isolation of Rat Liver Mitochondria—Coupled liver mitochondria were prepared by differential centrifugation of liver homogenates (34Spach P.I. Bottenus R.E. Cunningham C.C. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35Thayer W.S. Rubin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7717-7723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using ice-cold mitochondria isolation medium containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Protease inhibitors were added to the isolation buffer to prevent protein degradation (10Bailey S.M. Patel V.B. Young T.A. Asayama K. Cunningham C.C. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 2001; 25: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The total mitochondria yield from control animals was 220 ± 20 mg of protein and from ethanol-treated animals was 260 ± 10 mg of protein (n = 8, p = 0.19).Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—First dimension IEF was performed using 11-cm immobilized pH gradient strips with pH range 3–10 using an in-gel rehydration method. Briefly mitochondrial protein from control and ethanol-fed rats were diluted in a rehydration solution containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 2% ampholytes (pH 3–10), and 5 mm tributylphosphine and incubated for 30 min at room temperature to fully solubilize samples. After incubation, 180 μg of protein was applied to IEF gels, and the gels were allowed to rehydrate overnight. IEF was performed for 1 min at 300 V, 1.5 h at a 300–3500-V gradient, and then held at 3500 V for 4.5 h using an Amersham Biosciences Multiphor II system. After IEF, the immobilized pH gradient strips were equilibrated for 20 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue, and 65 mm dithiothreitol followed by a 20-min incubation in the same buffer containing 2.5% iodoacetamide in place of dithiothreitol before SDS-PAGE. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE was performed using 10% homogenous Tris-glycine acrylamide gels (Bio-Rad Criterion precast gels). After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Sypro Ruby Red (Molecular Probes), and gel images were captured with excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 and 620 nm, respectively, using the ProXpress imager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis—BN-PAGE was performed using the method developed by Schagger and von Jagow (29Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar, 30Schagger H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 555-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and modified by Brookes et al. (31Brookes P.S. Pinner A. Ramachandran A. Coward L. Barnes S. Kim H. Darley-Usmar V.M. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). All buffers and solutions were kept at 4 °C and pH 7.0. Mitochondrial pellets (1 mg of protein) were resuspended in 113 μl of extraction buffer containing 0.75 m aminocaproic acid, 50 mm BisTris, and 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and allowed to incubate on ice for 60 min. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant containing the extracted mitochondrial complexes was collected and kept on ice. Protein content was measured by the Bradford method, and 2.5 μl of a 5% (w/v) suspension of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Serva Blue G) in 0.5 m aminocaproic acid was added to 60 μg of protein (∼30 μl by volume). Samples were then stored on ice for no more than 30 min before being loaded onto a non-denaturing 5–16.5% gradient gel to separate the individual oxidative phosphorylation complexes intact. Electrophoresis buffers and conditions are as described previously (31Brookes P.S. Pinner A. Ramachandran A. Coward L. Barnes S. Kim H. Darley-Usmar V.M. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).After native electrophoresis, the entire vertical lane containing all the mitochondrial protein complexes was cut from the gel, rotated 90°, and laid on top of a denaturing 5–15% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gel to resolve the individual polypeptides of the complexes based on molecular weight (31Brookes P.S. Pinner A. Ramachandran A. Coward L. Barnes S. Kim H. Darley-Usmar V.M. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Samples from each pair of control and ethanol-treated mitochondria were resolved on one SDS-PAGE gel to control for intergel differences. In some experiments the individual oxidative phosphorylation complexes were excised from the first dimension BN-PAGE gel and applied to the top of a denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel to resolve individual proteins in that complex. For these experiments, each control and ethanol sample was run in duplicate so that one gel could be stained and the second gel could be immunoblotted to nitro-cellulose membranes. Gels were stained using a mixture of Coomassie Blue R-250 and G-250 (0.05% (w/v) each in 25% isopropanol, 10% glacial acetic acid). For immunoblot analysis, proteins were transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 5% nonfat milk. Levels of mitochondrial proteins were detected using a 1:10,000 dilution of primary antibodies (complex I iron-sulfur protein 5 and 7, complex III subunit I, complex IV subunit I, or ATP synthase α and β subunits) followed by incubation with a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Binding of the secondary antibody was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.Image Analysis of Two-dimensional Gels—Mitochondrial proteins from control and ethanol-fed rats were separated by the proteomic methods described above. Gels were scanned, saved as TIFF files, and analyzed for differences in protein expression using PDQuest Image Analysis software (Bio-Rad). Because the gels were stained with Sypro Ruby Red it was necessary to invert the data from the gels so that the fluorescent protein spots could be identified by the software as dark protein spot density against a light background. Protein spots were identified and a matched set containing five control gels with the corresponding ethanol gels was created. To compare protein spot density across different gels a reference gel (i.e. master image) was selected. To increase the likelihood that the highest possible number of protein spots in each gel could be matched to the corresponding protein spots in the master image, the selection of the master image was based on the highest number of detected proteins spots and the best protein spot resolution across the whole proteome. Thus, the control gel from pair 1 met all the requirements and was used as the master image for protein spot matching purposes. Automatic matching of protein spots in each gel to corresponding protein spots in the master image was performed, and the protein spots that were incorrectly matched to the reference gel were manually corrected. To correct for any possible intergel protein loading differences, the data for all protein spots in a given gel were normalized to the total density in valid protein spots for that gel. Normalized protein spot densities were transferred to Microsoft Excel, and -fold changes for each pair were determined. The -fold changes were then averaged resulting in a mean-fold change ± S.E. Normalized protein spot densities from control gels were compared with normalized protein spot densities from ethanol gels using a two-tailed paired Student's t test. Scanned TIFF images for one-dimensional and two-dimensional BN-PAGE were analyzed using Scion Image Beta 4.02 (Scion Corp.) after removing the background uniformly across all the pairs. The areas under the curve for the individual spots obtained from mitochondria isolated from ethanol-fed animals were normalized to their respective pair-fed controls and represented as -fold change. A two-tailed paired Student's t test was performed on the BN-PAGE raw data.Mass Spectrometry—Protein spots found by the image analysis to have altered levels of expression as a result of chronic ethanol feeding were excised from gels and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry essentially as described in Brookes et al. (31Brookes P.S. Pinner A. Ramachandran A. Coward L. Barnes S. Kim H. Darley-Usmar V.M. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) to identify these proteins. Gel pieces were washed with 5% acetonitrile to remove Coomassie Blue, SDS, and salts. After destaining, the gel pieces were dried, rehydrated with a trypsin-containing solution, and allowed to digest for 16–20 h. The in-gel tryptic digest was extracted several times with 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid. An aliquot of the peptide extract was mixed with an equal volume of the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, and 1.0 μl of this mixture was spotted onto a gold target plate for MALDI-TOF analysis using a PE-Biosystems Voyager Elite instrument (Framingham, MA) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm) and operated using a delayed extraction mode. The peptide masses were entered into the MASCOT search engine, 2See www.matrixscience.com. and the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base was searched to match the tryptic peptide fingerprint with a parent polypeptide.Mitochondrial DNA Damage Assessment by Quantitative PCR (QPCR)—Genomic DNA was extracted from liver homogenates, quantified using PicoGreen (Molecular Probes) on a Cytofluor 4000 Series fluorometer, and 15 ng was used for QPCR. QPCR assesses generalized DNA damage in a gene-specific manner in which DNA lesions block rTth polymerase and lead to a decrease in amplification (36Ballinger S.W. Patterson C. Yan C.N. Doan R. Burow D.L. Young C.G. Yakes F.M. Van Houten B. Ballinger C.A. Freeman B.A. Runge M.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 960-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 37Ballinger S.W. Van Houten B. Jin G.F. Conklin C.A. Godley B.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 68: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Sensitivity of the assay is increased through amplification of large targets that increases the probability of encountering a DNA lesion. A 16,059-bp QPCR product, which encompasses all but 236 bp of NADH5/6 genes in the mitochondrial genome was amplified using primer set M13597 FOR (bp 13597–13620) and 13361 REV (bp 13361–13337). Copy number differences in mitochondrial DNA were normalized using a short QPCR, which yields products directly related to gene copy number using primer pair 13597F/13713R (5′-CCCAGCTACTACCATCTTCAAGT/GATGGTTTGGGAGATTGGTTGATGT-3′) for mitochondrial DNA.Mitochondrial DNA damage was quantified by comparing the relative efficiency of amplification of large (>15-kb) fragments of DNA and normalizing this to gene copy numbers by the amplification of smaller (<250-bp) fragments, which have a statistically negligible likelihood of containing damaged bases. Hence, to measure mtDNA damage, long (L) and short (S) QPCRs were performed to determine DNA damage and number of gene copies present, respectively. To calculate lesion frequencies, the long QPCR values (L) were divided by the corresponding short QPCR results (S) to account for potential copy number differences between samples (L/S). Normalized values from damaged (Ld/Sd = Ad) samples were compared with non-damaged controls (Lo/So = Ao) resulting in a relative amplification ratio (Ad/Ao). Assuming a random distribution of lesions and using the Poisson equation (f(x) = eλλx/x! where λ = the average lesion frequency) for the non-damaged templates (zero class; x = 0), the average lesion frequency per DNA strand was determined: λ = -ln Ad/Ao·A.RESULTSFor these experiments, animals were fed a diet containing 36% total calories as ethanol for 5–6 weeks. Under these conditions a number of changes in mitochondrial function occur including inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis, increased formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and increased sensitivity to the regulation of respiration by NO (5Bailey S.M.

This exposure of ethanol decreased the activity of mitochondrial complexes I, III, and IV (Table I) in agreement with previous studies (12Cunningham C.C. Coleman W.B. Spach P.I. Alcohol Alcohol. 1990; 25: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Chronic ethanol consumption had no effect on citrate synthase activity (Table I) and total mitochondria protein yield, indicating that ethanol feeding had little effect on overall mitochondrial content or purity. This preparation does contain some minor contamination from other nonmitochondrial membrane sources but is functionally viable for the periods needed for respiratory measurement and proteomics.Table IChronic ethanol consumption decreases the activity of respiratory complexes I, III, and IV in liver Complex I activity was assessed by measuring the oxygen consumption of mitochondria isolated from control and ethanol-fed rats in the presence of glutamate/malate (5 mm) and ADP (0.5 mm). Antimycin-sensitive complex III activity was assessed indirectly by measuring the respiratory rate in the presence of succinate (15 mm), ADP (0.5 mm), and antimycin (2 nm). Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) and citrate synthase activities were measured using standard spectrophotometric methods (65Shepherd J.A. Garland G.P.

https://openalex.org/W2147042397,"In humans, lipid mobilization is considered to depend mainly on sympathetic nervous system activation and catecholamine action. A contribution of ANP was hypothesized because we have previously shown that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a lipolytic agent on isolated human fat cells. Control of lipid-mobilizing mechanisms was investigated using in situ microdialysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) in healthy young men during two successive exercise bouts performed at 35% and 60% peak oxygen consumption (VO2max) after placebo or acute oral tertatolol (nonselective beta-antagonist) treatment. In placebo-treated subjects, infusion of propranolol in the probe (100 micromol/l) only partially reduced (40%) the increment in extracellular glycerol concentration (EGC) promoted by exercise. Moreover, oral beta-adrenergic receptor blockade did not prevent exercise-induced lipid mobilization in SCAT while exerting fat cell beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Exercise-induced increase in plasma ANP was potently amplified by oral tertatolol. A positive correlation was found between EGC and plasma ANP levels but also between extracellular cGMP (i.e., index of ANP-mediated lipolysis) and EGC. Thus, we demonstrate that exercise-induced lipid mobilization resistant to local propranolol and lipid-mobilizing action observed under oral beta-blockade is related to the action of ANP. Oral beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, which potentiates exercise-induced ANP release by the heart, may contribute to lipid mobilization in SCAT. The potential relevance of an ANP-related lipid-mobilizing pathway is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2150415032,"Genetic studies using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have identified extensive matrilinear diversity among domestic horses. Here, we show that this high degree of polymorphism is not matched by a corresponding patrilinear diversity of the male-specific Y chromosome. In fact, a screening for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 14.3 kb of noncoding Y chromosome sequence among 52 male horses of 15 different breeds did not identify a single segregation site. These observations are consistent with a strong sex-bias in the domestication process, with few stallions contributing genetically to the domestic horse."

A general feature of MAPK cascades is their composition of three functionally linked protein kinases. A MAPK is phosphorylated and thereby activated by a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which itself becomes activated by another serine/threonine protein kinase, a MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK). Targets of MAPKs can be various transcription factors, protein kinases, or cytoskeletal proteins (1Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar).In plants, MAPK cascades are associated with various physiological, developmental, and hormonal responses, and it became clear that the same MAPK pathway components are involved in responses to different stimuli (2Jonak C.

J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3967-3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This situation put forward the major question, what ensures the fidelity of signaling, particularly in instances in which the same protein kinase functions in more than one pathway. The studies in yeast and mammals revealed that scaffold proteins, which tether MAPK modules in one complex, play important roles in defining the specificity. The first MAPK scaffold discovered was yeast Ste5 protein, which assembles MAPKKK, MAPKK, and MAPK of the pheromone mating pathway (10Kranz J.E. Satterberg B. Elion E.A.

MAPK components themselves were also found to function as scaffolds, such as yeast Pbs2 protein, the MAPKK of the high osmolarity/glycerol pathway (21O'Rourke S.M. Herskowitz I. O'Shea E.K. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 405-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Similarly, human MEKK2 shows synergistic interaction with MKK7 and JNK1 on its kinase domain and activates JNK1 most efficiently through MKK7 activation in the tripartite complex (22Cheng J. Yang J. Xia Y. Karin M. Su B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2334-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).In contrast, nothing is presently known about plant MAPK scaffolds. However, the observation that Arabidopsis MAP-KKK, MEKK1, interacts with Arabidopsis MAPKK, MKK1 and MKK2, and Arabidopsis MAPK, MPK4, in yeast (23Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Irie K. Morris P. Giraudat J. Matsumoto K. Shinozaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 532-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), implies that plant MAPKKKs might function as scaffold molecules.In this report, we show that OMTK1 encodes a functional novel alfalfa MAPKKK that is activated by H2O2 and induces cell death. OMTK1 possesses scaffolding function to bind and selectively activate the alfalfa MAPK, MMK3. Although MMK3 can be activated by several stimuli, including H2O2 (5Cardinale F. Meskiene I. Ouaked F.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36734-36740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), H2O2-induced MMK3 activation completely depends on the presence of OMTK1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation, Sequence Analysis, and Cloning of OMTK1—Primers corresponding to Arabidopsis MEKK1 were used to isolate OMTK1 from alfalfa by PCR. The PCR fragment obtained was cloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). Sequence analysis revealed the fragment to encode an alfalfa MAPKKK, denoted as OMTK1, which subsequently was used to screen an alfalfa (Medicago sativa) cDNA library prepared from somatic embryos. An isolated clone was fully sequenced and found to contain an open reading frame of 592 amino acids. The nucleotide and predicted protein sequences are available in the EMBL data base under accession number AJ575100.In Vitro Binding Assays—MMK3 was expressed as GST fusion proteins as described previously (4Kiegerl S. Cardinale F. Siligan C. Gross A. Baudouin E. Liwosz A. Eklof S. Till S. Bogre L. Hirt H. Meskiene I. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of the recombinant proteins were determined with the Bio-Rad detection system (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard, and the purity of the protein fractions was determined by Coomassie staining after 10% SDS-PAGE. OMTK1 was in vitro transcribed/translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TnT T7/T3-coupled reticulocyte lysate systems kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μlof in vitro transcribed/translated OMTK1 or ΔOMTK1 was incubated overnight at 4 °C in 100 μl of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) in the presence of 5 μg of GST or GST-MMK3, respectively. Subsequently, 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes were washed four times with wash buffer and denatured with SDS loading buffer. The proteins were analyzed by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE.Transient Expression Assays—Transient expression assays were performed with isolated protoplasts from cultured Arabidopsis cell suspension. The isolation, transformation, and cultivation of protoplasts were described earlier (6Ouaked F. Rozhon W. Lecourieux D. Hirt H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1282-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). HA-tagged SIMK and MMK3 were prepared as described previously (4Kiegerl S. Cardinale F. Siligan C. Gross A. Baudouin E. Liwosz A. Eklof S. Till S. Bogre L. Hirt H. Meskiene I. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The open reading frames of MMK2 and SAMK were fused at their C termini to a triple hemagglutinin (HA) epitope and cloned into the plant expression vector pRT101, and the open reading frames of OMTK1 and ΔOMTK1 were fused at their C termini to a double Myc epitope and cloned into the vector pRT101. Arabidopsis protoplasts were transiently transformed via polyethylene glycol with 4 μg each of the plasmids pSH9-SIMK-HA, pRT101-MMK2-HA, pRT100-MMK3-HA, or pRT101-SAMK-HA and the indicated concentrations of pRT101-OMTK1-Myc or pRT101-ΔOMTK1-Myc. Then they were subjected to different treatments 12–16 h after transformation. After treatment, extracts were prepared from the protoplasts and used for immunocomplex kinase assay with antibodies raised against HA or Myc.Immunocomplex Kinase Assays—Protoplast extracts containing equal protein amounts were subjected to a 2-h preincubation in the presence of 20 μl of mixed protein A- and G-Sepharose beads (1:1). The supernatant was then immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of anti-HA monoclonal antibody and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20) and once with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Kinase reactions of the immunoprecipitated proteins were performed in 15 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of MBP, 0.1 mm ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The protein kinase reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min, and the reactions were stopped by adding 4× SDS loading buffer. The phosphorylation of MBP was analyzed by autoradiography after separation on 15% SDS-PAGE.Immunoblots—For Western analysis, equal amounts of protein extracts from protoplasts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) by electroblotting. Membranes were probed with either anti-HA monoclonal antibody or with anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (A-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence as recommended by the manufacturer (Gene Image, Amersham Biosciences).Treatment of Transiently Transformed Protoplasts—Transiently transformed Arabidopsis protoplasts were treated with 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), 2 mm H2O2, 500 μg/ml yeast elicitor (YE), or 100 μm proteasome inhibitor MG115. Samples were harvested at 10 min.Cell Death Assessment—Transiently transformed Arabidopsis protoplasts were treated with or without 2 mm H2O2 for 6 h, and then the number of live and dead cells was determined by double staining with the fluorescent probes fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI). Protoplasts were incubated with 2 μg/ml FDA and 6 μg/ml PI in culture medium for 30 min and were observed with an inverted fluorescent microscope (Zeiss). Images of the fluorescent signal were captured using a digital camera. Over 1000 cells from three different randomly selected fields were counted to determine the percentage of dead cells. The percentage of induced cell death was calculated by subtracting the percentage of dead cells of empty vector transformed non-treated protoplasts divided by the transformation efficiency of the protoplasts, which was determined by transformation with a vector expressing green fluorescent protein.RESULTSPrimary Structure of OMTK1—While screening for new members of the plant MAPKKK family from alfalfa, we isolated a novel MAPKKK, OMTK1. The OMTK1 C-terminal putative kinase domain showed 68.1%, 65%, 64.9%, 60.6%, 40.9%, and 23.6% identity to the kinase domains of Arabidopsis MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, MEKK4, ANP1, and CTR1, respectively. Identity of the kinase domains and the position of the kinase domains in whole proteins suggest that OMTK1 is closely related to the A1 subgroup of the plant MEKK family of MAP-KKKs (24MAPK GroupTrends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). The N-terminal non-catalytic region of OMTK1 showed no significant similarity to any known functional sequence motifs.OMTK1 Selectively Activates the MMK3 Pathway in Plant Protoplasts—To investigate which MAPK pathway is regulated by OMTK1, we transiently coexpressed OMTK1 and four different alfalfa MAPKs in plant protoplasts. Because we found that OMTK1 is autoactive to a certain extent in Arabidopsis protoplasts (see Fig. 3D) 2H. Nakagami and H. Hirt, unpublished results. we transiently expressed HA-tagged MAPKs alone or with different amounts of Myc-tagged OMTK1 in Arabidopsis protoplasts and determined the kinase activity of the HA-immunoprecipitated MAPKs using MBP as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 2, upon coexpression with OMTK1-Myc only MMK3-HA was activated in the protoplasts. As can be seen by immunoblotting, the differences of MAPKs-HA activation by OMTK1-Myc coexpression were not due to differences in MAPK protein amounts. These results indicate that OMTK1 selectively activates MMK3.Fig. 3OMTK1 is activated by H2O2.A, H2O2 MMK3 in combination with OMTK1 in protoplasts. activates Arabidopsis protoplasts were transiently transformed with MMK3-HA alone (lane 1) or MMK3-HA in combination with OMTK1-Myc (0.2 μg of plasmid) (lanes 2–6). Protoplasts were treated for 10 min with 250 mm NaCl (lane 3), 1 mm ACC (lane 4), 2 mm H2O2 (lane 5), 500 μg/ml YE (lane 6), or an equivalent amount of distilled water (lanes 1 and 2). MMK3-HA activity was determined from protein extracts by immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody followed by an in vitro kinase assay with MBP as a substrate. The same extracts were immunoblotted with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies. B, MMK3 is activated by H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of OMTK1. Arabidopsis protoplasts were transiently transformed with MMK3-HA alone or MMK3-HA in combination with OMTK1-Myc (0.2 μg of plasmid), and protoplasts were treated for 10 min with different concentrations of H2O2. MMK3-HA activity was determined from protein extracts by immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody followed by in vitro kinase assays with MBP as a substrate. The same extracts were immunoblotted with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies. C, kinetics of MMK3 activation by H2O2. Arabidopsis protoplasts were transiently transformed with MMK3-HA alone or MMK3-HA in combination with OMTK1-Myc (0.2 μg of plasmid). Protoplasts were treated with 2 mm H2O2 for the indicated times. MMK3-HA activity was determined from protein extracts by immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody followed by in vitro kinase assays with MBP as a substrate. The same extracts were immunoblotted with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies. D, OMTK1 phosphorylates MBP. Arabidopsis protoplasts were transiently transformed with OMTK1-Myc alone (4 μg of plasmid), and protoplasts were treated for 10 min with 2 mm H2O2 (lane 2), distilled water (lane 3), or before treatment (lane 1). OMTK1-Myc activity was determined from protein extracts by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Myc antibody followed by in vitro kinase assays with MBP as a substrate. The same extracts were immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 2OMTK1 selectively activates MMK3 in protoplasts.

After SDS-PAGE, MAPK activities on MBP were determined by autoradiography. Expression levels of MAPKs-HA and OMTK1-Myc were assessed by immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibody, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)OMTK1 Is Activated by H2O2—To define the stimuli that can regulate OMTK1 activity, OMTK1-Myc and MMK3-HA were coexpressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts, and the protoplasts were treated with different stimuli. As shown in Fig. 3A, only H2O2 strongly activated MMK3-HA in combination with OMTK1-Myc. Interestingly, MMK3-HA alone was not notably activated by H2O2, but coexpression of OMTK1-Myc resulted in severalfold higher activation of MMK3-HA (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition, OMTK1-induced activation of MMK3 by H2O2 occurred in a dose-dependent manner above concentrations of 200 μm H2O2 (Fig. 3B), and H2O2-induced MMK3 activation occurred in 5 min and stayed at nearly the same level more than 90 min (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the addition of OMTK1-Myc did not affect the activities of SIMK, MMK2, and SAMK under H2O2 treatment (data not shown). Furthermore, we tested other stimuli, methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, abscisic acid, benzyl alcohol, α-naphthaleneacetic acid, kinetin, and cold stress, but none of them activated MMK3-HA in combination with OMTK1-Myc (data not shown). These data suggest that H2O2 activates an OMTK1-dependent MAPK pathway. Interestingly, as can be seen by immunoblotting, protein amounts of OMTK1-Myc were affected by NaCl and H2O2 treatment (Fig. 3A). This phenomenon is reproducible and was also seen in other experiments. Because of the basal activity of OMTK1, activation of MMK3 by H2O2 might be explained by increased OMTK1 protein levels, but this mechanism seems not to be sufficient for MMK3 activation in response to NaCl treatment (Fig. 3A). To clarify whether OMTK1 is functional as a kinase, we tried to detect its kinase activity. Immunoprecipitated OMTK1-Myc from untreated protoplasts could phosphorylate MBP (Fig. 3D, lane 1), indicating that OMTK1 possesses low constitutive kinase activity. However, total kinase activity of OMTK1 markedly increased in parallel with OMTK1 protein levels upon treatment of protoplasts with H2O2 (Fig. 3D, lane 2). These results show that OMTK1 activity and protein levels are regulated by H2O2.Accumulation of OMTK1 Protein Is Not Sufficient to Activate the MMK3 Pathway—Activation of OMTK1 by H2O2 was generally accompanied with OMTK1 protein accumulation (Fig. 3, A–D). Because OMTK1 was expressed in protoplasts under the 35S promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus, the observed differences in OMTK1 protein amounts cannot be explained by changes of transcription. To investigate the possibility that OMTK1 protein levels are regulated by changes in protein stability, protoplasts expressing OMTK1-Myc and MMK3-HA were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG115. As shown in Fig. 4A, MG115 treatment resulted in rapid and higher accumulation of OMTK1 than after H2O2 treatment. These results indicate that OMTK1 is regulated by a proteasome-dependent pathway. Interestingly, in contrast to H2O2 treatment, accumulation of OMTK1 by MG115 treatment did not lead to MMK3 activation (Fig. 4A, lane 2 and 3, respectively). In addition, we found that, under MG115 treatment, OMTK1 could be further activated by H2O2 treatment (Fig. 4B). These results strongly suggest that besides protein stability other post-translational mechanisms are involved in regulating OMTK1.Fig. 4Accumulation of OMTK1 is not sufficient to activate MMK3 in protoplasts.A, proteasome inhibitor MG115 treatment stabilizes OMTK1 but does not activate MMK3 in protoplasts. Arabidopsis protoplasts were transiently transformed with MMK3-HA in combination with OMTK1-Myc (0.2 μg of plasmid). Protoplasts were treated for 10 min with 2 mm H2O2 (lane 2), 100 μm MG115 (lane 3), or an equivalent amount of distilled water (lane 1). MMK3-HA activity was determined from protein extracts by immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody followed by an in vitro kinase assay with MBP as a substrate. The same extracts were immunoblotted with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies. B, stabilized OMTK1 can be further activated by H2O2. Arabidopsis protoplasts were transiently transformed with OMTK1-Myc (4 μg of plasmid). Protoplasts were preliminary treated with 100 μm MG115 (lane 3) for 10 min, then further treated with 2 mm H2O2 (lane 2) or an equivalent amount of distilled water (lane 1) for 10 min. OMTK1-Myc activity was determined from protein extracts by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Myc antibody followed by in vitro kinase assays with MBP as a substrate. The same extracts were immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)OMTK1 Induces Cell Death—H2O2 is known to induce programmed cell death. To investigate if the OMTK1 signaling pathway regulates cell death, we analyzed cell viability of transiently transformed Arabidopsis protoplasts with or without H2O2 treatment. After 6 h of 2 mm H2O2 treatment, no significant increase of cell death was observed in protoplasts transformed with empty vector (Fig. 5). Expression of MMK3 slightly induced cell death in the absence and upon H2O2 treatment. In contrast, coexpression of OMTK1 and MMK3 highly induced the cell death rate in the absence and presence of H2O2. These results indicate that the OMTK1 pathway triggers cell death.Fig. 5OMTK1 induces cell death.Arabidopsis protoplasts were transiently transformed with MMK3-HA alone or MMK3-HA in combination with OMTK1-Myc (4 μg of plasmid), and protoplasts were treated with or without 2 mm H2O2 for 6 h. Protoplasts were stained with FDA for living cells and PI for dead cells. To determine the percentage of dead protoplasts, over 1000 protoplasts from three different randomly selected fields were counted under each condition. Bars represent the standard deviation between samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Kinase Domain of OMTK1 Is Sufficient to Mediate H2O2 Signaling to the MMK3 Pathway—In an attempt to define which part of OMTK1 is important to receive H2O2 signaling and to activate MMK3, we constructed truncated OMTK1 (ΔOMTK1) which lacks the N-terminal putative regulatory domain (amino acids 1–310, Fig. 1A). To compare ΔOMTK1-Myc with full-length OMTK1-Myc, different amounts of ΔOMTK1-Myc were expressed in protoplasts. As observed with full-length OMTK1, ΔOMTK1-Myc poorly activated MMK3-HA and showed much lower protein amounts in the absence of H2O2 treatment (Fig. 6A).Fig. 6Property of ΔOMTK1.A, ΔOMTK1 activates MMK3 under H2O2 treatment in protoplasts. Arabidopsis protoplasts were transiently transformed with MMK3-HA in combination with 0.05 μg(lanes 1 and 2), 0.1 μg(lanes 3 and 4), or 0.2 μg(lanes 5 and 6) ΔOMTK1-Myc plasmid, or 0.2 μg of OMTK1-Myc plasmid (lanes 7 and 8). Protoplasts were treated with (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) or without (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) 2 mm H2O2 for 10 min. MMK3-HA activities were determined from protein extracts by immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody followed by in vitro kinase assays with MBP as a substrate. The same extracts were immunoblotted with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies. B, ΔOMTK1 shows reduced activity to trigger cell death. Arabidopsis protoplasts were transiently transformed with MMK3-HA alone or MMK3-HA in combination with ΔOMTK1-Myc (4 μg of plasmid) or OMTK1-Myc (4 μg of plasmid). Protoplasts were stained with FDA for living cells and PI for dead cells.

As shown in Fig. 6B, coexpression of ΔOMTK1 and MMK3 also induced cell death, however, the rate of ΔOMTK1/MMK3-induced cell death was far lower in comparison with that induced by full-length OMTK1/MMK3. Because induction of cell death showed strong correlation with MMK3 activity (Figs. 3 and 5), these results indicate that the OMTK1 N-terminal domain is necessary to fully activate MMK3. Interestingly, expression of OMTK1 or ΔOMTK1 alone also induced cell death. These observations could be due to the activation of endogenous MAPKs by OMTK1. Reduced activity of ΔOMTK1 is compatible with the idea that the OMTK1 N-terminal domain is needed to fully activate the downstream MAPK.OMTK1 and MMK3 Exist in a Complex in Vivo—So far, our analysis revealed that OMTK1 is an upstream activator of MMK3. In principle, activation of MAPKs by upstream factors can occur in a transient manner or by stable complex formation. Although this mechanism was intensively studied in yea"
https://openalex.org/W2024628862,"Hsp27 is expressed at high levels after mild heat shock and contributes to making cells extremely resistant to subsequent treatments. The activity of the protein is regulated at the transcriptional level, but also by phosphorylation, which occurs rapidly during stress and is responsible for causing the dissociation of large 700-kDa Hsp27 oligomers into dimers. We investigated the mechanism by which phosphorylation and oligomerization modulate the protective activity of Chinese hamster Hsp27. In contrast to oligomer dissociation, which only required Ser90 phosphorylation, activation of Hsp27 thermoprotective activity required the phosphorylation of both Ser90 and Ser15. Replacement of Ser90 by Ala90, which prevented the dissociation of the oligomer upon stress, did cause a severe defect in the protective activity. Dissociation was, however, not a sufficient condition to activate the protein because replacement of Ser15 by Ala15, which caused little effect in the oligomeric organization of the protein, also yielded an inactive protein. Analyzes of mutants with short deletions in the NH2 terminus identified the Hsp27 WD/EPF or PF-rich domain as essential for protection, maintenance of the oligomeric structure, and in vitro chaperone activity of the protein. In light of a three-dimensional model of Hsp27 based on the crystallographic structure of wheat Hsp16.9, we propose that the conserved WD/EPF motif of mammalian Hsp27 mediates important intramolecular interactions with hydrophic surfaces of the α-crystallin domain of the protein. These interactions are destabilized by Ser90 phosphorylation, making the motif free to interact with heterologous molecular targets upon the additional phosphorylation of the nearby Ser15.

Hsp27 has generated much interest because in addition to accumulating to high levels within a few hours after stress, the protein already present at the time of treatment is phosphorylated within minutes in a stress-sensitive signaling pathway involving the MAP kinase p38 (9Rouse J.

It has been suggested that such a rapid phosphorylation is important to set up a prompt homeostatic mechanism helping to survive stress and accordingly many studies have shown an essential role of phosphorylation in the protective activity of Hsp27 (13Arrigo A.P.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 335-373Google Scholar). Hsp27 belongs to the small Hsp (sHsp) family also called the HspB family, which have representatives in virtually all organisms. In human, the family includes 10 members comprising HspB1/Hsp27, HspB2/MKBP, HspB3/HspL27, αA- and αB-crystallin, Hsp20, HspB7/cvHsp27, HspB8/H11/Hsp22, HspB9, and HspB10/Odf1 (13Arrigo A.P.

The major characteristic of these proteins is the presence at their carboxyl terminus of a sequence of about 100 residues called the α-crystallin domain. The NH2 terminus is less well conserved, but a small prolinephenylalanine-rich region containing one or two WD/EPF motifs is found in many of the sHsp proteins (16Ehrnsperger M. Buchner J. Gaestel M.

Evol. 1993; 10: 103-126PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp27, like most studied sHsp, is found under normal conditions in large oligomers with a molecular mass of some 700 kDa (17Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Structural studies have been difficult because the oligomeric structure is highly dynamic, the high molecular oligomer being in equilibrium with dimers or tetramers and showing a high rate of subunit exchange (19Bova M.P. McHaourab H.S. Han Y. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1035-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the crystal structure of two sHsp has been determined to date, revealing that oligomers of sHsp form as a result of multiple interactions in the α-crystallin domain, stabilized in some but not all cases, by interaction with hydrophobic sequences of the NH2-terminal (20van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 21Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H.

In the case of Hsp27, the oligomer is formed of an estimated number of 24 subunits and deletion studies confirmed the role of molecular interactions at the NH2 terminus in the stability of the oligomers (17Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Studies, both in vitro with recombinant proteins and in vivo with endogenous or ectopically expressed proteins, indicated that phosphorylation causes the dissociation of the oligomers into dimers that are suggested to be the basic building unit of sHsp (17Lambert H.

There are numerous pieces of evidence that phosphorylation or changes in the supramolecular organization modulate the activity of Hsp27. The capacity to modulate actin microfilament dynamics was the first biochemical activity described for Hsp27. In a cell-free assay, small Hsp27 species behave as actin capping proteins that regulate actin polymerization in a phosphorylation-dependant manner (24Miron T. Vancompernolle K. Vandekerckhove J. Wilchek M. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 25Benndorf R. Hayess K. Ryazantsev S. Wieske M. Behlke J. Lutsch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, overexpression of wild type or pseudo-phosphorylated Hsp27 but not a non-phosphorylatable mutant induced an enhanced accumulation of stress fibers in response to growth factors or mild cytotoxic stress (6Huot J. Houle F. Spitz D.R. Landry J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1999; 277: C1032-C1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an effect that in the case of oxidative stress or cisplatin treatment can lead to actin filament-dependent cell blebbing (30Huot J. Houle F. Rousseau S. Deschesnes R.G. Shah G.M. Landry J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1361-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In other contexts, this activity results into a phosphorylation-dependent protection of the actin filaments against severe stress such as cell treatment with the actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin-D. Hsp27 also possesses a chaperone-like activity preventing the thermal aggregation of protein in vitro (31Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Like other sHsp, Hsp27 has no protein folding activity, but it can adsorb heat-denatured protein keeping them in a folding-competent state (33Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The role of phosphorylation in this function is not totally clear. In yeast, both small and large oligomers participate in chaperone activity of the Hsp27 homologue, Hsp26 (34Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). It is proposed that small oligomers bind denatured proteins during hyperthermia. After heat shock, they re-associate into large oligomers with the misfolded proteins (34Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). A sHsp from Cyanobacteria seems to be able to bind denatured proteins both in its small and large oligomeric forms, however, dissociation of the oligomers is required for releasing the sHsp from its substrate and thus for refolding to occur (35Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). On the contrary, although evidence suggest that mammalian Hsp27 bind denatured proteins in a way similar to yeast Hsp26, it was reported that small phosphorylated oligomers of mammalian Hsp27 have reduced chaperone activities (23Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Multimerization is, however, not required for the chaperoning activity of αB-crystallin (36Feil I.K. Malfois M. Hendle J. van Der Zandt H. Svergun D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12024-12029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation has also been shown to regulate the inhibition by Hsp27 of a caspase-independent cell death process mediated by Daxx and Ask1 (37Charette S.J. Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7602-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly considering all the evidence for a regulation of Hsp27 activity by phosphorylation, phosphorylation/dissociation has also been shown to affect the protective activity of Hsp27 at the level of survival. Phosphorylation appears essential for protecting against heat shock-induced loss of clonogenic activity. It is also essential for protection against the toxic action of a number of anticancer drugs (6Huot J. Houle F. Spitz D.R. Landry J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lavoie J.N.

Chem. 2002; 277: 19913-19921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast, the non-phosphorylated and oligomeric species of high molecular weight are better at protecting against tumor necrosis factor-α or oxidative stress, suggesting different modes of protection of Hsp27 against different stresses (39Wyttenbach A. Sauvageot O. Carmichael J. Diaz-Latoud C. Arrigo A.P. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 40Mehlen P. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Arrigo A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Hsp27 is phosphorylated on 2 (rodent) or 3 (human) serine residues by MAPKAP kinase-2, a kinase activated by p38 in a cascade of activation/phosphorylation reactions involving, in the case of heat shock, MKK3/6 and Ask1 (9Rouse J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 30792-30797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser90 (Chinese hamster sequence) is sufficient and necessary to induce the dissociation of the Hsp27 oligomers into basic dimeric subunits (17Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The role of Ser15 phosphorylation is, however, unknown. Hsp27 with Ser15 replaced by Glu15 to mimic phosphorylation or Hsp27 in which Ser90 is replaced by Ala90 so that only Ser15 is phosphorylatable, are expressed in cells as high molecular oligomers only slightly smaller that the wild type protein in the presence or absence of stress, suggesting that the major role of this phosphorylation site is not to regulate oligomerization (17Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the role of phosphorylation at Ser15 and Ser90 in the protective function of Hsp27 against heat shock-induced cell killing. Our results suggest an essential role for both phosphorylation events, one (Ser90) in dissociating the oligomeric structure thereby exposing an active site at the NH2 terminus and the other (Ser15) in derepressing this active site. An important site for activity was mapped to the hydrophobic motif WD/EPF, which in wheat sHsp, Hsp16.9, corresponds to a sequence predicted to play an important role in the supramolecular organization of the protein. Plasmids—pSVHa27WT contains the wild type Chinese hamster Hsp27 sequence from pH8 inserted in HindIII sites of the pSVT7 vector (45Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G. Tanguay R.M. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3420-3429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation mutant constructs pSVHa27AA, pSVHa27EE, pSVHa27AE, and pSVHa27EA were as described before (17Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), whereas pSVHa27DD was constructed as described later. The two last letters of the phosphorylation mutant constructs correspond to the amino acid residue substituted at positions 15 and 90, respectively. Alanine (A), glutamate (E), or aspartate (D) have been added to mimic non-phosphorylatable (A) or pseudo-phosphorylated (E or D) serine residues. pSVHa27Δ5-23 was described before (17Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). All other Hsp27 deletants/mutants were constructed especially for this study using a PCR-based Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (ExSite™, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, polymerase chain reactions were performed on pSVHa27WT as template using two oligonucleotides covering the boundaries of the deletion or the mutation. After amplification, the reaction products were digested with DpnI (Invitrogen) and the polymerase chain reaction products were ligated with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen). The plasmid for expression of the chimeric Hsp27-luciferase protein (pCMVHa27-luciferase) was constructed from the full-length Hsp27 insert of pSVHa27WT inserted at the HindIII/XhoI restriction sites of the pCMV-luciferase vector (17Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). pCMVHa27-luciferase was then used as template to produce the Hsp27 deletants in fusion with luciferase. Preparation of Recombinant Hsp27 Proteins—Vectors for the expression of the recombinant Hsp27 were prepared by insertion of the Hsp27 wild type, mutated, or deleted sequences at the BamHI restriction site of the pGEX4T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting plasmids were subcloned in Escherichia coli strain BL21 Codon+ RIL (Stratagene) producing glutathione S-transferase-Hsp27 fusion proteins (GST-Hsp27) after addition of 0.15 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. Bacteria were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.45 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, the Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics), 1.25 mg/ml lysozyme, and 11.2 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma). Extraction of the GST-Hsp27 proteins from the inclusion bodies was done by a 1-h incubation with vigorous shaking at 37 °C in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and the Complete protease inhibitor. The solubilized GST-Hsp27 proteins were affinity purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and digested with thrombin (Sigma) overnight at room temperature yielding recombinants of Hsp27 with the two additional residues, serine and glycine, before the NH2-terminal methionine. The proteins were purified to homogeneity by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein concentration was determined using a extinction coefficient of 1.87 for a 1 mg/ml solution at 280 nm (46Ehrnsperger M. Lilie H. Gaestel M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14867-14874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The size distribution of the multimeric complexes formed by the recombinant proteins was determined by chromatography on a Superose 12 HR column (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH 3T3 cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere, in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. Cells were plated 24 h before transfection at a concentration of 16,000 cells/cm2 in a 25-cm2 culture flask (in vivo thermoprotective assay) or 4,000 cells/cm2 in a 100-mm Petri dish (glycerol gradient and glutaraldehyde cross-linking analysis). Transfection by calcium phosphate was performed as previously reported with varying amounts of plasmids (0-5 μg) in a 25-cm2 culture flask and 0-10 μg of plasmids in a 100-mm Petri dish (5Landry J. Chrétien P. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Chloroquine (50 μm) was added for the first 5 h of transfection. Glycerol Gradient Ultracentrifugation—Cell lysates were prepared 72 h after transfection by brief sonication in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 3.33% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. Supernatant was cleared by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The lysates (0.5 ml) were loaded on the top of a 12.6-ml linear gradient of glycerol (10-40%) made in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (17Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The tubes were centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 18 h in a SW40 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C. The gradients were fractionated in ∼44 fractions. Aliquots were diluted (1:4) in Tris glycine/SDS buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 0.01% SDS), dot-blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed for Hsp27 using an antibody developed against the COOH-terminal tail of Chinese hamster Hsp27 (Upstate). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. Detection and quantification were done using the Storm Imaging system from Amersham Biosciences and recombinant Hsp27 (5 ng/μl) as standard. Hsp27 Thermoprotective Activity—The cells were transfected with a graded amount of plasmids to obtain varying expression levels of the protein. The cells were trypsinized 24 h after transfection and plated at a concentration of 1, 5, or 25 × 104 cells per 25-cm2 culture flasks. Twenty hours later, the cells were heat shocked for 2.5 h in a water bath maintained at 44 °C and were returned to 37 °C to allow for colony formation. Colonies were stained 13 days later with a solution of 0.25% (w/v) trypan blue and 5% (v/v) acetic acid. Cellular survival was evaluated by counting colonies that contained more than 50 cells. Hsp27 concentration was determined in control groups of transfected cells at the time of heat shock. Quantification was performed by Western blot using the anti-COOH-terminal Hsp27 antibody as described above after electrophoresis of total cell extracts. A standard curve was generated using recombinant Hsp27 as standard (5 ng/μl). Luciferase Activity—Aliquots (10 μl) of each protein extract were diluted in 300 μl of 25 mm glycyl/glycine buffer, pH 7.8, containing 10 mm MgSO4,2mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Luciferase activity was measured in a Berthold Lumat 9501 luminometer for 30 s after the addition of 100 μl of D-luciferin at a final concentration 50 μm. In Vitro Thermal Aggregation Assay—The thermal denaturation kinetics of citrate synthase (CS) were measured from the light scattering at 320 nm during incubation at 43 °C using a Varian spectrophotometer (model Cary 1 Bio) equipped with a temperature-controlled cell holder. CS was diluted at a concentration of 150 μm (monomer) in a solution of 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, in the absence or presence of various concentrations of Hsp27. Three-dimensional Modeling of Hsp27—The secondary structure of Chinese hamster Hsp27 (HaHsp27) was calculated with the Web-based software JNET (47Cuff J.A. Barton G.J. Proteins. 2000; 40: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) 2Available at www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk. and PROFsec and PHDsec (48Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol.

Hughey R. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). 4Available at www.supfam.org., With this alignment, residues of Hsp27 were transferred onto the coordinate of the corresponding residues of the structure of Hsp16.9 (Protein Data Bank codes 1GME chain A and 1GME chain B) using the HOMOLOGY module of INSIGHT II software (Accelrys). Loops that are located between the conserved secondary structure elements were also generated using the HOMOLOGY module. The potential energy of the model of Hsp27 was then minimized using FDISCOVER. Calculations were done on an Octane2 computer (Silicon Graphics, Inc.). Molecular drawings were made with the software Ribbons (50Carson M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Both Ser15 and Ser90 Is Necessary for Full Hsp27 Thermoprotective Activity—NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding various phosphorylation mutants of Chinese hamster Hsp27 and subjected 48 h later to severe heat shock treatment at 44 °C for 150 min. In control sham-transfected NIH 3T3 cells or in cells transfected with empty vectors, such treatments yielded survival in the order of 10-5 to 10-4. In the various experiments, between 1 and 10 cells of 100,000 plated cells could grow into colonies after heat shock. In agreement with the known thermoprotective activity of Hsp27, transient transfection with graded amounts of Hsp27-WT plasmids yielded a dose-dependent increase in survival (Fig. 1a). The pseudo-phosphorylated Hsp27-EE (Fig. 1a) and Hsp27-DD (data not shown) mutants, in which Ser15 and Ser90 had been replaced by glutamate or aspartate, respectively, were also highly protective; the dose-response curve obtained for these mutants was identical to that obtained with Hsp27-WT.

Increased caspase-3 activity associated with apoptosis was found in the skin of wild-type mice after tumor promotion with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and this effect was diminished in PPARβ-null mice. The onset of tumor formation, tumor size, and tumor multiplicity induced from a two-stage carcinogen bioassay (7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) were significantly enhanced in PPARβ-null mice compared with wild-type mice. To begin to characterize the molecular changes underlying this PPARβ-dependent phenotype, microarray analysis was performed and a number of differentially regulated gene products were identified including ubiquitin C. Subsequent promoter analysis, reporter gene assays, site-directed mutagenesis, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays provide evidence that PPARβ regulates ubiquitin C expression, and that ubiquitination of proteins is influenced by PPARβ. These results strongly suggest that activation of PPARβ-dependent target genes provides a novel strategy to inhibit tumor promotion and carcinogenesis.

Keratinocytes, the major cell type of the epidermis, provide a protective epidermal barrier against the external environment. The regulation of proliferation and the unique process of differentiation in keratinocytes are essential in maintaining epidermal function (1Eckert R.L. Welter J.F. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1996; 23: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation are regulated by various biological factors including cytokines and extraneous signals through different signal transduction pathways. For example, activation of transcription factors such as activator protein 1 (AP-1), 1The abbreviations used are: AP-1, activator protein 1; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; DMBA, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine. and signal transducer and activator of transcription, can regulate the expression of genes that in turn influence cell proliferation and differentiation. AP-1 is a major regulator of keratinocyte function, and is activated by phosphorylation via several mechanisms including the protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Alterations in these pathways induced by chemical toxicants can cause disruption of keratinocyte cell cycle control, which could lead to skin cancer (1Eckert R.L. Welter J.F. Mol. Biol.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors and members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (3Bocher V. Pineda-Torra I. Fruchart J.C.

PPARs modulate target gene expression in response to ligand activation after heterodimerization with retinoid X receptor and binding to peroxisome proliferator-responsive elements. Three different PPAR isoforms, each encoded by distinct genes, have been identified and designated PPARα, PPARβ (also referred to as PPARδ), and PPARγ. PPARs exhibit relatively unique tissue distribution and appear to have distinct physiological functions (3Bocher V. Pineda-Torra I. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 967: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4Hihi A.K. Michalik L. Wahli W. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 5Shearer B.G. Hoekstra W.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Extensive studies have been performed examining the biological role of PPARα, and many of these were facilitated by the use of the PPARα-null mouse. Through these studies, it was shown that PPARα mediates the pleiotropic response of peroxisome proliferators, with critical roles in the regulation of target genes that modulate lipid metabolism and hepatocarcinogenesis (6Lee S.S.

PPARγ is known to have important roles in adipocyte differentiation, glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and immune function (11Clark R.B. J.

Additionally, the recent description of a conditional PPARγ-null mouse model provided definitive evidence demonstrating a direct role of PPARγ in target gene regulation that modulates lipid and cholesterol transport in macrophages (15Akiyama T.E. Sakai S. Lambert G. Nicol C.J. Matsusue K. Pimprale S. Lee Y.H. Ricote M. Glass C.K. Brewer Jr., H.B. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2607-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In contrast to PPARα and PPARγ, considerably less is known about the biological functions of PPARβ. PPARβ is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues with relatively high expression in brain, digestive tract, and skin, suggesting possible developmental or physiological roles in these tissues (16Escher P.

Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 483-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the significant increase in the number of reports correlating expression of PPARβ to specific biological functions in the past five years, definitive evidence from a null mouse model is lacking for many of these associations. A striking reduction in adiposity in PPARβ-null mice compared with wild-type mice strongly supports its functional role in lipid metabolism (33Peters J.M. Lee S.S.T. Li W. Ward J.M. Gavrilova O. Everett C. Reitman M.L. Hudson L.D. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5119-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 34Chawla A. Barak Y. Nagy L. Liao D. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). A role for PPARβ in regulating expression of adipose differentiation-related protein in macrophages in response to very low density lipoprotein has also been described using PPARβ-null cells, suggesting that PPARβ may influence atherosclerotic lesion formation (35Chawla A. Lee C.H. Barak Y. He W. Rosenfeld J. Liao D. Han J. Kang H. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1268-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies using a PPARβ-null mouse model showed that PPARβ functions in skin wound healing (36Michalik L. Desvergne B. Tan N.S. Basu-Modak S. Escher P. Rieusset J. Peters J.M.

Wahli W. Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Whereas PPARβ does not directly modulate changes in the expression of genes known to regulate epithelial cell differentiation including transglutaminase, involucrin, and small proline-rich proteins in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), the hyperplastic response to TPA in the epidermis is significantly enhanced in PPARβ-null mice (33Peters J.M. Lee S.S.T. Li W. Ward J.M. Gavrilova O. Everett C. Reitman M.L. Hudson L.D. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5119-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that PPARβ has a critical role in attenuating epidermal cell proliferation, likely because of reduced expression of PPARβ target genes. In this study, the role of PPARβ in the molecular and biochemical regulation of skin cancer was examined in the PPARβ-null mouse model. Two-stage Chemical Carcinogenesis Bioassay—The generation of wild-type and PPARβ-null mice used for this work has been previously described (33Peters J.M. Lee S.S.T. Li W. Ward J.M. Gavrilova O. Everett C. Reitman M.L. Hudson L.D. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5119-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Two-stage chemical carcinogen testing was performed with male wild-type (n = 11) and PPARβ-null (n = 13) mice (7-8 weeks old). Mouse skin was initiated with 50 μg of DMBA dissolved in 200 μl of acetone. One week after DMBA treatment, mice were treated topically with 5 μg of TPA dissolved in 200 μl of acetone, three times per week for 24 weeks. The onset of papilloma formation, and the number and size of papillomas were assessed weekly for each mouse. Caspase-3 Activity—Cytosolic protein samples from wild-type or PPARβ-null mice (control and TPA-treated) were isolated 8 and 48 h post-TPA application or after 2 weeks of 3×/week applications (5 μg/mouse/application) as described above. Caspase-3 activity was measured using a colorimetric assay (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) and data are presented as units of activity per μg of protein. TUNEL Staining—Skin samples from wild-type or PPARβ-null mice (control and TPA-treated) were isolated after 2 weeks of 3×/week applications (5 μg/mouse/application) as described above, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sections (4-6 μm) were prepared. Apoptotic cells were detected using a FragEL™ DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA). Apoptotic cells were quantified using light microscopy and data are presented as the average number of apoptotic cells/frame/slide examined. A total of four slides per treatment group were analyzed and an average of 55 frames ± 3 were examined per slide. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Labeling Index—Wild-type or PPARβ-null mice were injected intraperitoneally with BrdUrd (100 mg/kg) and then treated with TPA (5 μg/mouse/application), followed 48 h later with a second intraperitoneal injection of BrdUrd and TPA application. Twenty-four hours after the second treatment with BrdUrd and TPA, mice were euthanized and skin samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Fixed skin samples were embedded in paraffin, sections (4-6 μm) were prepared, and detection of BrdUrd-labeled keratinocytes was performed using an immunohistochemical assay (Exalpha Biologicals, Inc., Watertown, MA). BrdUrd-labeled keratinocytes were quantified using light microscopy and the labeling index quantified as described by others (39Lu Y.P. Lou Y.R. Xie J.G. Peng Q.Y. Liao J. Yang C.S. Huang M.T. Conney A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12455-12460Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). A total of five slides per treatment group, and a minimum of 1000 cells per slide were examined. Keratinocyte Culture—A previously described method (40Dlugosz A.A. Glick A.B. Tennenbaum T. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was used to culture keratinocytes obtained from 2-day-old neonates from both genotypes. Keratinocytes were cultured in low calcium medium (0.05 mm) until 80% confluent at which time medium was replaced with low calcium medium containing various concentrations of L-165041 in a range known to specifically activate PPARβ (41Berger J. Leibowitz M.D. Doebber T.W. Elbrecht A. Zhang B. Zhou G. Biswas C. Cullinan C.A. Hayes N.S. Li Y. Tanen M. Ventre J. Wu M.S. Berger G.D. Mosley R. Marquis R. Santini C. Sahoo S.P. Tolman R.L. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6718-6725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) or used for transient transfections. The treatment period with the PPARβ ligand L-165041 was 8 h, and RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and the manufacturer's protocol. Skin Histology—After TPA treatment for 2 or 24 weeks, mice were euthanized by overexposure to carbon dioxide. The dorsal skin area was excised, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sections (4-6 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological examination. Skin tumors were randomly selected after termination of TPA treatment, fixed and stained as described above, and examined for lesion progression. RNA Isolation—Skin samples from wild-type or PPARβ-null (control and TPA-treated) mice were isolated 8 h post-treatment. Tissue samples were placed in liquid nitrogen and ground with a mortar and pestle. Ground tissue was further homogenized in TRIzol reagent using a tissuemizer. The remaining procedures for the isolation of total RNA from skin were performed using the manufacturer's protocol. Isolation of RNA from cultured keratinocytes was performed using TRIzol extraction and the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and quantified by spectrophotometry. Microarray Analysis—A commercial microarray containing 2700 cDNAs (Discovery ARRAY 1.1, Display Systems Biotech, Vista, CA) was used to identify novel genes that may be controlled by PPARβ. The advantage of this microarray is there is no bias toward known genes or previously cloned genes, and there is an emphasis on coding regions rather than 3′-untranslated regions. Hybridization and washing were performed following the manufacturer's recommended procedure. Ten micrograms of total RNA isolated from the skin of either one wild-type or PPARβ-null mouse treated with TPA (8 h post-application, 5 μg per mouse) was labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 dyes and hybridized overnight on the microarray slide. A reciprocal labeling method was used to verify changes in gene expression. After hybridization and washing, the slide was scanned with lasers and the fluorescent images were overlaid. Differences in the Cy5/Cy3 ratio were analyzed for statistically significant differences using Gene Pix Pro (Axon Instrument, Union City, CA). A 99% confidence interval was calculated from the ratios of Cy5/Cy3, and differentially expressed cDNAs were determined by selecting those cDNAs whose relative Cy5/Cy3 ratio was outside of the 99% confidence interval. Northern Blot Analysis—To confirm altered expression of PPARβ target genes detected by microarray analysis or to examine mRNA levels after various treatments, 5 to 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel containing 0.22 m formaldehyde, transferred to a nylon membrane, and ultraviolet cross-linked to fix the RNA. Membranes were hybridized in ULTRAhyb hybridization buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX) with random primed probes (Display Systems Biotech, Vista, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol, and washed with salt/detergent solutions using standard procedures. Protein Isolation—Skin samples from wild-type or PPARβ-null (control and TPA treated) mice, isolated 8 h post-treatment, were used to prepare cytosolic fractions. Samples of skin were placed in liquid nitrogen and then ground to a fine powder before total nitrogen evaporation. Samples were placed in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors without detergent followed by differential centrifugation at 1,000 and 100,000 × g. The supernatant from the high speed spin was used for the cytosolic fraction and the pellet was used for microsomes. The protein concentration of each sample was quantified using the BCA detection system (Pierce). Western Blot Analysis—Twenty-five to 50 μg of protein from wild-type or PPARβ-null (control and TPA treated) skin samples were resolved using SDS-PAGE. The samples were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using an electroblotting method. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody, followed by an incubation with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). An ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect immunoreactive protein. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-ubiquitin (Sigma) or anti-lactate dehydrogenase (Rockland Inc., Gilbertsville, PA). Detection of free ubiquitin was performed as described by others (42Mimnaugh E.G. Bonvini P. Neckers L. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cloning the Murine Ubiquitin C Promoter—The PCR primers for amplifying the ubiquitin C promoter were designed using the sequence obtained from the Celera Mouse Genome Data base (CMGD, Release 12). The forward primer sequence was 5′-CAGCCTGGTCTACATAGCATATTCC-3′, and the reverse primer sequence was 5′-ACGGAAACCAAACGTCTGGG-3′. A 1092-bp sequence containing the murine ubiquitin C promoter was cloned by PCR into PCRIITOPO vector (Invitrogen), using the C57BL/6N mouse genomic DNA as template, and confirmed by sequencing. Based on the murine polyubiquitin sequences (GenBank™ accession numbers AF285161 and AF285162), the 1092-bp promoter clone contains nucleotides -963 to +128 (+1 refers to the transcription start site) of the ubiquitin C promoter. The ubiquitin C promoter clone was subsequently subcloned into the pGL3-Basic firefly reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) in the 5′ to 3′ orientation, and this construct was confirmed by sequencing. The human ubiquitin C promoter reporter construct containing nucleotides -951 to +4 (GenBank™ accession number D63791) was kindly provided by Dr. S. Russ Price. Transient Transfections—HepG2 cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) with 0.4 μg of PPARα-, PPARβ-, or PPARγ-pSG5 expression vectors, 0.4 μg of either the human ubiquitin C promoter reporter construct or the murine ubiquitin C promoter reporter construct, and 0.2 μg of a β-galactosidase construct as a control for transfection efficiency. Transfected cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and luciferase activity was measured with a luciferase assay system (Promega) using a Turner TD-20e luminometer. Experiments were performed three times using triplicates for each treatment group, and because of some variability between experiments, data are expressed as a percentage of control normalized luciferase activity (luciferase activity/β-galactosidase activity). For analysis of the PPRE in the mouse ubiquitin C promoter, a 121-bp fragment containing the putative PPRE was amplified by PCR using the ubiquitin C promoter construct as template, subcloned into the pGL3-Promoter firefly reporter plasmid (Promega) in the 5′ to 3′ orientation, and confirmed by sequencing; referred to as pGL3P-mUbcPPRE herein. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed (QuikChange™ Kit, Stratagene Inc.) to introduce a single base pair mutation in the mUbcPPRE (AGGTCACAGCCCT was changed to AAGTCACAGCCCT, mutation in bold), and confirmed by sequencing. Keratinocytes from wild-type and PPARβ-null mice were obtained as described above, cultured to 80% confluency, and transfected with 0.4 μg of the pGL3P-mUbcPPRE and 0.2 μg of a β-galactosidase construct, or 0.4 μg of the mutant pGL3P-mUbcPPRE and 0.2 μg of a β-galactosidase construct. Transfected keratinocytes were allowed to recover for 12 h prior to treatment with L-165041 or vehicle control for 12 h, at which time cells were harvested for analysis of luciferase activity as described. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—To determine whether PPARβ can directly bind to the putative PPRE identified in the murine ubiquitin C promoter, PPARs were in vitro transcribed and translated (TnT, Promega), and incubated with oligonucleotides encoding either the putative PPRE, or a mutated PPRE (see below), which were end labeled using [γ-32P]ATP in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 60 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC). For competition, unlabeled PPRE was added at the indicated molar excess. The following oligonucleotide sequences were used: PPRE-sense strand (5′-CCTCGAGGTCACAGCCCTTGCCC-3′), PPRE-antisense strand (5′-GGGCAAGGGCTGTGACCTCGAGG-3′), mutant PPRE-sense strand (5′-CCTCGAAGCTTCAGCCCTTGCCC-3′), and mutant PPRE-antisense strand (5′-GGGCAAGGGCTGAAGCTTCGAGG-3′). The PPRE is underlined and the mutated bases are indicated in bold. For supershift analysis, 0.6 μg of an anti-PPARβ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was included in the incubation mixture. Binding products were resolved on a 5% acrylamide gel and autoradiography was performed using standard protocols. Co-treatment of TPA and MG-132—Wild-type or PPARβ-null mice, 8 weeks of age were shaved of dorsal hair, and 24 h later were treated topically with MG-132 dissolved in acetone. The treatment area of skin was weighed from previous experiments and it was determined that the average weight of skin was approximately 1 g. This weight was used to calculate an estimated effective concentration in skin equal to approximately twice the KI of MG-132 for proteasome inhibition (8 nm). Based on this calculation, 200 μl of a solution containing 19 ng of MG-132/ml was applied per mouse. Mice were treated with MG-132 at 0600, and then retreated with MG-132 at 0700, followed by 5 μg of TPA dissolved in 200 μl of acetone 15 min after the last MG-132 application. Skin samples were collected after 48 h post-TPA for analysis of epithelial hyperplasia after fixation, sectioning in paraffin, and staining with H&E as described above. Enhanced Skin Carcinogenicity in PPARβ-null Mice—The rationale for examining the role of PPARβ in skin carcinogenesis is based on the observation of enhanced epidermal hyperplasia and mRNA levels of gene products known to regulate cell cycle progression in PPARβ-null mouse skin 48 h post-TPA treatment compared with wild-type controls (33Peters J.M. Lee S.S.T. Li W. Ward J.M. Gavrilova O. Everett C. Reitman M.L. Hudson L.D. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5119-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, topical application of TPA resulted in exacerbated epidermal hyperplasia accompanied with hyperkeratosis in PPARβ-null mice compared with controls (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that PPARβ functions to attenuate epidermal cell proliferation. As it is known that application of TPA can increase epithelial apoptosis (43Kemp C.J. Vo K. Gurley K.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 2051-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), caspase-3 activity was measured and TUNEL staining was performed to determine whether alterations in apoptosis contribute to the observed difference in epithelial cell proliferation. Indeed, increased caspase-3 activity and TUNEL-positive cells were observed in response to TPA in wild-type mouse skin (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, increased caspase-3 activity and TUNEL-positive cells were lacking in skin samples from similarly treated PPARβ-null mice. Whereas the BrdUrd labeling index was significantly increased in TPA-treated wild-type mouse skin as compared with control wild-type (Fig. 1D, 2.8-fold increase), the BrdUrd labeling index observed in TPA-treated PPARβ-null mouse skin was considerably greater as compared with similarly treated wild-type mice (Fig. 1D, 4.5-fold increase). To determine whether these alterations in cell proliferation were biologically significant, a skin cancer bioassay was performed, using wild-type and PPARβ-null mice. Following initiation with DMBA and promotion by weekly applications of TPA, the onset of papilloma formation was significantly sooner in PPARβ-null mice. The first papillomas were observed in null mice after only 7 weeks of TPA administration, whereas wild-type mice began to develop papillomas after 15 weeks of TPA (Fig. 1E). Whereas 100% of the PPARβ-null mice developed papillomas after 11 weeks of tumor promotion, a much smaller percentage of wild-type mice had developed papillomas during the same time frame (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, after 24 weeks of treatment, a significantly smaller percentage of wild-type mice had developed papillomas after 24 weeks of TPA treatment (Fig. 1E). The average number and size of papillomas in PPARβ-null mice were also greater than in wild-type (Fig. 1E). Histological examination of tumors from wild-type and PPARβ-null mice revealed that most lesions in both genotypes were squamous cell papillomas. However, sebaceous gland adenomas and keratocanthomas were found in a small cohort of PPARβ-null mice, and neither of these lesions were observed in wild-type mice (data not shown). No evidence of early dysplasia, early carcinomas,"
https://openalex.org/W2018279422,"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is the major water channel of the neuromuscular system, but its physiological function in both perivascular astrocytes and skeletal muscle sarcolemma is unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess the following in skeletal muscle: a) the expression of all cloned water cannels; b) the functional role of AQP4 using sarcolemma vesicles purified by means of several fractionation methods, and c) the functional effect of AQP4 reduction in mdx mice, the animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Immunofluorescence and immunoblot experiments performed with affinity purified antibodies revealed that only AQP1 and AQP4 are expressed in mouse skeletal muscle: AQP1 in endothelial cells of continuous capillaries and AQP4 on the plasma membrane of muscle fiber. Plasma membrane vesicle purification was performed with a procedure extensively used to purify and characterize dystrophin-associated proteins (DAPs) from rabbit skeletal muscle. Western blot analysis showed strong co-enrichment of the analyzed DAPs and AQP4, indicating that the membrane vesicle preparation was highly enriched in sarcolemma. Stopped-flow light-scattering measurements showed high osmotic water permeability of sarcolemma vesicles (approximately 150 microm/s) compatible with the AQP-mediated pathway for water movement. Sarcolemma vesicles prepared from mdx mice revealed, in parallel with AQP4 disappearance from the plasma membrane, a strong reduction in water permeability compared with wild-type mice. Altogether, these results demonstrate high AQP4-mediated water permeability of the skeletal muscle sarcolemma. Expression of sarcolemmal AQP4 together with that of vascular AQP1 may be responsible for the fast water transfer from the blood into the muscle during intense activity. These data imply an important role for aquaporins in skeletal muscle physiology as well as an involvement of AQP4 in the molecular alterations that occur in the muscle of DMD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2016391226,"Transthyretin (TTR) is a plasma homotetrameric protein that acts physiologically as a transporter of thyroxine (T4) and retinol, in the latter case through binding to retinol-binding protein (RBP). A fraction of plasma TTR is carried in high density lipoproteins by binding to apolipoprotein AI (apoA-I). We further investigated the nature of the TTR-apoA-I interaction and found that TTR from different sources (recombinant and plasmatic) is able to process proteolytically apoA-I, cleaving its C terminus after Phe-225. TTR-mediated proteolysis was inhibited by serine protease inhibitors (phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, Pefabloc, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, chymostatin, and Nα-p-tosyl-l-phenylala-nine-chloromethyl ketone), suggesting a chymotrypsin-like activity. A fluorogenic substrate corresponding to an apoA-I fragment encompassing amino acid residues 223-228 (Abz-ESFKVS-EDDnp) was used to characterize the catalytic activity of TTR, including optimum reaction conditions (37 °C and pH 6.8) and catalytic constant (Km = 29 μm); when complexed with RBP, TTR activity was lost, whereas when complexed with T4, only a slight decrease was observed. Cell lines expressing TTR were able to degrade Abz-ESFKVS-EDDnp 2-fold more efficiently than control cells lacking TTR expression; this effect was reversed by the presence of RBP in cell culture media, therefore proving a TTR-specific proteolytic activity.

Geisow M.J. Oatley S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 339-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) that is mainly synthesized by the liver and the choroid plexus of the brain (2Dickson P.W. Howlett G.J. Schreiber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8214-8219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, TTR functions as a carrier for both thyroxine (T4) and retinol (vitamin A), in the latter case through binding to the retinol-binding protein (RBP) (3Monaco H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We have determined previously that apolipoprotein AI (apoA-I) is also a TTR ligand; physiologically, a fraction of plasma TTR circulates in high density lipoproteins (HDLs) through binding to apoA-I (4Sousa M.M. Berglund L. Saraiva M.J. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 58-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its major protein component. The physiological meaning of this interaction remains to be explained, but it first suggested that it might be relevant in physiological conditions, namely in lipid and/or TTR metabolism. Previous evidence suggested that TTR and lipoprotein biology might be related. In the kidney, megalin, a member of the lipoprotein receptor family, is responsible for TTR tubular reabsorption (5Sousa M.M. Norden A.G.W. Jacobsen C. Willnow T.E. Christensen E.I. Thakker R.V. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. Saraiva M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38176-38181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TTR uptake by the liver (its major site of degradation) is sensitive to the receptor-associated protein, an inhibitor of uptake of all the ligands of the lipoprotein receptor family (6Sousa M.M. Saraiva M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14420-14425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Several point mutations in TTR have been linked to the occurrence of TTR-related amyloidosis (ATTR), a disorder that is characterized by the extracellular systemic deposition of mutated or wild-type (wt) TTR as amyloid fibrils (7Saraiva M.J.M. Birken S. Costa P.P. Goodman D.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1984; 74: 104-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cornwell I.I.I. Sletten K. Jonhansson B. Westermark P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), leading to organ dysfunction and death. The mechanisms by which soluble proteins self-assemble into a fibrillary structure are unknown. Proteolysis has been thought to play an important role in most types of amyloidoses; in several cases, an amyloid peptide is generated by proteolysis of the corresponding protein precursor (9Kisilevsky R. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 10Schormann N. Murrell J.R. Benson M.D. Amyloid. 1998; 5: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). C-terminal TTR peptides with proteolysis occurring between amino acid residues 42 and 59, in addition to intact protein, have been found in amyloid fibrils of some ATTR patients (11Gustavsson A. Jahr H. Tobiassen R. Jacobson D.R. Sletten K. Westermark P. Lab. Investig. 1995; 73: 703-708PubMed Google Scholar). This raised the hypothesis that proteolysis could trigger fibril formation.Amyloidogenic variants of apoA-I have also been reported (12Walsh M.T. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). ApoA-I, a 243-amino acid protein, is synthesized by the liver and plays a key role in the formation, metabolism and catabolism of HDL cholesterol esters. Numerous attempts have been made to determine the arrangement of the amphipathic helices of apoA-I in nascent HDL discs, as they appear to be a critical intermediate in reverse cholesterol transport; however, the tertiary arrangement of apoA-I molecules on HDL particles is not defined yet. In apoA-I-related amyloidosis, amyloid fibrils are characterized by deposition of N-terminal fragments of variable length in the mutated protein (12Walsh M.T. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Interestingly we identified an amyloidogenic variant of apoA-I, L178H, where fibrils presented both mutated apoA-I and wt TTR that co-localized in amyloid deposits as seen by immunohistochemistry and analysis of extracted fibrils (13de Sousa M.M.

This data further suggested that the interaction between apoA-I and TTR might be relevant not only physiologically but also in pathological conditions. In this report we further investigated the apoAI-TTR interaction and verified that TTR is able to process apoA-I proteolytically.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProteins and Protease Inhibitors—Recombinant TTR was produced in Escherichia coli D1210 transformed with pINTR plasmid carrying TTR cDNA (14Furuya H. Nakazato M. Saraiva M.J. Costa S.P. Sasaki H. Matsuo H. Goto I. Sakaki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The protein was isolated and purified as described previously (15Almeida M.R. Damas A.M. Lans M.C. Brower A. Saraiva M.J. Endocrine. 1997; 6: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, after osmotic shock of bacteria, protein extracts were run on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-cellulose (Whatman) ion exchange chromatography, dialyzed, lyophilized, and isolated in native preparative Prosieve agarose (FMC Corp.) gel electrophoresis following the supplier's instructions. After electrophoresis, the TTR band was excised and electroeluted in an Elutrap system (Schleicher & Schuell) in 38 mm glycine and 5 mm Tris, pH 8.3, overnight at 50 V (4 °C). A final purification by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on a Protein Pak 125 column (Waters) coupled to a high precision pump (P-302) and a halocrome-280 UV detector (Gilson), using as eluent 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and 400-μl fractions were collected. Protein standards used for calibration were bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and lysozyme (14 kDa). Serum TTR was purified as described previously (15Almeida M.R. Damas A.M. Lans M.C. Brower A. Saraiva M.J. Endocrine. 1997; 6: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasma was dialyzed against 77 mm NaCl and 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, and run on a DEAE-cellulose ion exchange column, after which protein fractions were dialyzed, lyophilized, and chromatographed on a blue Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Plasma TTR was isolated by preparative electrophoresis, followed by electroelution and HPLC as described above for recombinant TTR. Serum RBP was isolated by affinity in a TTR column and saturated with 3.3 mg/ml all-trans retinol (Sigma) in ethanol as follows: (i) 25 μl of all-trans-retinol were incubated with 800 μl of RBP (1 mg/ml) at 37 °C in the dark for 1 h; and (ii) excess retinol was separated from RBP by gel filtration in 10-ml Biogel P-6 DG columns (Bio-Rad). Recombinant ApoA-I, α2-macroglobulin, and diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) were from Calbiochem. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and T4 were from Sigma. Pefabloc, Pefabloc SC Plus, chymostatin, Nα-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine-chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine-chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), antipain, aprotinin, phosphoramidon, E64, EDTA, bestatin, pepstatin, and leupeptin were from Roche Applied Science.TTR Proteolysis Assay Using ApoA-I as Substrate—TTR and apoA-I at an equimolar ratio were incubated in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, at 37 °C for 3 h unless stated otherwise. After incubation, reactions were run on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (0.125% Coomassie Blue reagent, 50% methanol, and 10% acetic acid). For inhibition assays, TTR was pre-incubated with each of the protease inhibitors (either 4 mm Pefabloc or 4 mm Pefabloc Plus, 10 mm EDTA, 10 μm E-64, 10 μm phosphoramidon, 10 μm bestatin, 0.3 μm aprotinin, 100 μm TPCK, 100 μm TLCK, 100 μm chymostatin, 100 μm leupeptin, 100 μm antipain, 1 mm PMSF, 100 μm DFP, 1 μm pepstatin, and α2-macroglobulin equimolar with TTR) for 30 min at 37 °C before the addition of apoA-I.Analysis of ApoA-I Cleavage Products—For N-terminal sequencing of cleavage products, the apoAI-TTR reaction was run on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and stained with Coomassie Blue for 5 min. Pieces of membrane containing apoA-I fragments were excised, and N-terminal sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems model 494 protein sequencer. For matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), apoA-I cleavage products were cut from a 15% SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie Blue. Gel bands were reduced by incubation with 0.01 m dithiothreitol and 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5) alkylated with 0.015 m iodoacetamide and 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5) and prepared for trypsin digestion by washing once with 0.05 m Tris (pH 8.5) and 25% acetonitrile and twice with 0.05 m Tris (pH 8.5) and 50% acetonitrile. After destaining, gel bands were digested with trypsin and analyzed on a Perspective Voyager DE-RP mass spectrometer in a linear mode (16Henzel W.J. Billeci T.M. Stults J.T. Wong S.C. Grimley C. Watanabe C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5011-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). For C-terminal sequencing of the apoA-I fragments, 200 μg TTR and 100 μg of apoA-I were incubated in 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, overnight at 37 °C, and the reaction was run on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Pieces of membrane containing apoA-I fragments were excised, and C-terminal sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems model 494 protein sequencer (17Boyd V.L. Bozzini M. Zon G. Noble R.L. Mattaliano R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).SDS-PAGE Zymography—12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing casein (Bio-Rad) were used to identify caseinolytic activity of TTR. 25 μg of recombinant TTR were run per lane. After electrophoresis, gels were incubated in 2.5% Triton X-100 (renaturation buffer; Bio-Rad) for 30 min and subsequently overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% Brij 35 (development buffer; Bio-Rad). Gels were then stained with 0.5% Coomassie Blue in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 2 h and destained in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 1 h. For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), blocked with 5% blocking buffer (5% nonfat dried milk in phosphate buffer saline), incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit polyclonal anti-TTR (DAKO; 1:2000 in blocking buffer), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (The Binding Site; 1:5000 in blocking buffer). The immunoblot was developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) as substrate.Fluorometric Assessment of Proteolysis—TTR proteolytic activity was tested with a fluorogenic peptide (Abz-ESFKVS-EDDnp; Global Peptide) encompassing the sequence of apoA-I cleaved by TTR. Abz-ESFKVS-EDDnp is an internally quenched fluorescent peptide in which Abz (ortho-aminobenzoic acid) is the fluorescent donor and EDDnp [N-(ethylenediamine)-2,4-dinitrophenyl amide] is the fluorescent quencher. A stock solution of peptide substrate was prepared by dissolving the peptide in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) to a final concentration of 1 mm. TTR was added to the substrate in an equimolar ratio (5 μm) at a final volume of 100 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8). Hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate was monitored by measuring fluorescence at λem = 420 nm and λex = 320 nm in an fmax plate reader (Molecular Devices). The kinetics of the reaction was followed for 3 h at 37 °C. To convert relative fluorescence units (RFU) into nanomoles of cleaved substrate, a calibration curve was obtained from the total cleavage of the fluorogenic peptide with chymotrypsin (which is also able to cleave Abz-ESFKVS-EDDnp) by incubating 1 nmol of Abz-ESFKVS-EDDnp substrate with 1 unit of chymotrypsin in a final volume of 200 μl of reaction buffer overnight at 37 °C; serial dilutions ranging from 0.005 to 1 nmol of cleaved peptide substrate were measured at λem = 420 nm and λex = 320 nm. Km was determined according to Michaelis-Menten using concentrations of substrate ranging from 0.5 to 100 μm and 5 μm of TTR. The optimum pH for TTR activity was determined in 50 mm Tris with pH values ranging from 3 to 9. TTR complexed with RBP was obtained by incubation in a 1:4 (TTR/RBP) molar ratio for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. Complex formation between TTR and T4 was performed according to Almeida et al. (15Almeida M.R. Damas A.M. Lans M.C. Brower A. Saraiva M.J. Endocrine. 1997; 6: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, TTR activity was tested as described above. As a control for the effect of TTR ligands, chymotrypsin activity was tested in the presence of RBP or T4 under the same conditions used for TTR.Cellular Assays—Cell lines were propagated in 12-well plates in monolayers and maintained at 37 °C in a 95% humidified atmosphere and 5% CO2. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium; Invitrogen). RN22 (rat schwannoma cell line) and FAO (rat hepatoma) cell lines were from the American Type Culture Collection. SAHep (human hepatoma without TTR expression) and Huh7 (human hepatoma with high levels of TTR expression) cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. João Monjardino (Imperial College, London, UK). RN22 cell lines were stably co-transfected with human wt TTR cDNA, subcloned in the p169ZT plasmid, which contains the metallothionein inducible promoter (18Sousa M.M. Fernandes R. Palha J.A. Taboada A. Vieira P. Saraiva M.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 1935-1948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and with a plasmid conferring resistance to neomycin (pL2Neo, kindly provided by Dr. Paulo Vieira, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) following the CaPO4-DNA precipitate method (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.33-16.36Google Scholar). RN22 cell lines stably transfected with human wt TTR cDNA were named RN22 wt. SAHep and FAO cell lines were co-transfected with a construct carrying human wt TTR cDNA under the control of the mouse endogenous TTR promoter (pGEM-2 pTTR exV3, a kind gift from Dr. Robert Costa, University of Illinois, Chicago) and the pL2Neo plasmid using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 3 × 105 cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture plates 1 day before transfection and exposed to a mixture of LipofectAMINE and plasmid DNA for 5 h, after which Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum was added. Resistant colonies were selected in medium supplemented with G418 (1 mg/ml, Sigma). SAHep and FAO cell lines stably transfected with human wt TTR cDNA were termed SAHep wt and FAO wt, respectively. Huh7 and SAHep cells were grown until ∼80% confluence, after which the culture medium was removed and replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum supplemented with 40 μg/ml DQ gelatin (Molecular Probes). DQ gelatin is an intramolecularly quenched substrate heavily labeled with fluorescein, which is used as a substrate for several proteases. Proteolysis of DQ-gelatin yields fluorescent cleaved gelatin-fluorescein peptides; therefore, the localization of fluorescence indicates the sites of net proteolytic activity. For inhibition assays, either 1 mg/ml Pefabloc or 2 μg/ml aprotinin were added to the culture medium. Cells were observed 24 h later on a fluorescence microscope (Auxiovert 200 m, Zeiss). Images were acquired with a coupled digital camera (Zeiss) using either transmission or the fluorescein isothiocyanate channel (λem = 515 nm and λex = 495 nm). In cellular assays using Abz-ESFKVS-EDDnp, ∼80% confluent RN22, RN22 wt, FAO, FAO wt, SAHep, and SAHep wt cells were incubated with 4 nmol of Abz-ESFKVS-EDDnp at 37 °C for 24 h. To assess the effect of RBP, a molar excess of this TTR ligand was added to the culture medium for 1 h at 37 °C before the addition of Abz-ESFKVS-EDDnp. Fluorometric assessment of proteolysis was performed by using 100 μl of each conditioned medium and measuring fluorescence at λem = 420 nm and λex = 320 nm in a Molecular Devices fmax plate reader. After removing conditioned media, cells were treated with 0.1 m NaOH until complete lysis and total protein quantification was performed by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin ranging from 50 to 200 μg/ml as standard. TTR expression in each cell line was assessed by a TTR quantitative enzyme-linked immunoreactive assay (ELISA). 96-well plates (Maxisorp-Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-rabbit TTR (DAKO; 1:500 in 0.1 m carbonate buffer) and blocked with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline. 100 μl of each conditioned media were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Development was performed using peroxidase-conjugated anti-human TTR (1:500 in phosphate buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)/H2O2. TTR concentration was calculated from a standard curve ranging from 5 to 200 ng/ml. Proteolytic activity was defined as 1 nanomole of cleaved substrate per microgram of total cellular protein in each cell line. Three independent experiments were performed, and results depict a representative experiment.RESULTSIdentification of TTR Proteolytic Activity—We have established previously that a fraction of plasma TTR circulates in HDLs through binding to apoA-I (4Sousa M.M. Berglund L. Saraiva M.J. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 58-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further address the nature of the interaction between TTR and apoA-I, we tried to obtain a complex of the two proteins by incubation at 37 °C and physiological pH. By SDS-PAGE analysis, we observed that apoA-I was cleaved in the presence of recombinant TTR (Fig. 1A, lane 4). A major apoA-I fragment of ∼26 kDa was seen; however, with higher incubation times, two extra apoA-I fragments could be observed (data not shown). This was the first evidence suggesting that TTR might be a cryptic protease able to use apoA-I as a substrate. To confirm this hypothesis, incubation of apoA-I with plasma TTR was performed, and the same pattern of SDS-PAGE migration was obtained (Fig. 1A, lane 5). The fact that incubation of apoA-I with either recombinant TTR or plasma TTR from different sources generated the same pattern of apoA-I degradation (Fig. 1A) pointed to a TTR-intrinsic proteolytic activity and argued against the presence of a contaminant protease in the preparation. TTR preparations presented decreased proteolytic activity or completely lost activity with repeated freeze-thawing cycles. LCQ/MS/MS, a powerful tool for identifying protein contaminants in preparations, was performed in one of the recombinant TTR preparations and only TTR-related peaks were observed (data not shown), further suggesting that TTR itself is a novel cryptic protease. To further verify the ability of TTR to act as a protease, we used casein zymography because casein is well known to act as a universal protease substrate (20Jobin M.C. Grenier D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 220: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When TTR was run on casein zymogram gels, one major band of degraded casein was visualized (Fig. 1B, arrow). To ascertain whether TTR was responsible for the appearance of the unstained, degraded casein band, we performed anti-TTR Western analysis of zymograms, which showed that the band with caseinolytic activity corresponded in fact to TTR (Fig. 1B).Serine Protease Inhibitors Block ApoA-I Cleavage by TTR—To characterize the nature of the proteolytic activity of TTR, we used a spectrum of protease inhibitors and tested their ability to block apoA-I cleavage by TTR. α2-macroglobulin (α2M), an inhibitor of all classes of proteases, completely inhibited proteolysis of apoA-I (data not shown); the serine protease inhibitors Pefabloc, PMSF, and DFP abolished apoA-I processing by TTR, whereas inhibitors of other protease classes were without effect (Fig. 2). Chymostatin and TPCK, inhibitors of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases, were also able to block TTR activity (Fig. 2). These data suggested that TTR has a chymotrypsin-like serine protease activity.Fig. 2SDS-PAGE analysis of the inhibition of apoA-I cleavage by TTR using different classes of protease inhibitors. 2 μg of recombinant TTR were pre-incubated with each of the protease inhibitors (either 4 mm Pefabloc, 4 mm Pefabloc Plus, 10 mm EDTA, 10 μm E-64, 0.3 μm aprotinin, 100 μm TPCK, 100 μm TLCK, 1 mm PMSF, 100 μm chymostatin, 100 μm DFP, 100 μm antipain, or 10 μm phosphoramidon) for 30 min at 37 °C before the addition of 1 μg of apoA-I and subsequent incubation for 3 h at 37 °C. *, protease inhibitors that inhibit apoA-I cleavage by TTR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Identification of the Cleavage Site on ApoA-I—To establish the cleavage site in apoA-I, we started by performing N-terminal sequencing of apoA-I fragments generated upon incubation with TTR. As the identified N terminus of the major proteolytic fragment of apoA-I was intact, we concluded that cleavage was occurring in the C terminus of the protein, and we subsequently analyzed the major apoA-I proteolytic fragment by MALDI-MS. A C-terminally deleted apoA-I was identified, presenting MS peaks spanning from amino acid residues 1 to 215 of the protein (Table I). As can be seen by comparison of the MALDI-MS of tryptic peptides derived from full-length apoA-I and apoA-I digested by TTR (Table I), cleavage by TTR occurred between amino acid residues 216 and 226 of apoA-I, because the 216-226 peptide peak, corresponding to the sequence QGLLPVLESFK, was missing in the tryptic MS analysis of apoA-I digested by TTR (Table I). To determine the exact cleavage site, the highest molecular weight fragment of apoA-I digested by TTR was subjected to C-terminal sequencing. This analysis identified the cleavage site in apoA-I as being after Phe-225. For subsequent proteolytic assays, a fluorogenic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 223-228 of apoA-I (Abz-ESFKVS-EDDnp), which encompasses the sequence that is being cleaved by TTR, was used.Table IMS analysis of tryptic peptides derived from full-length apoA-I and TTR-digested apoA-IPositionSequenceFull-length apoA-Ia+, present; −, absent.TTR-digested apoA-Ia+, present; −, absent.1-10DEPPQSPWDR++1-12DEPPQSPWDRVK++13-23DLATVYVDVLK++13-40DLATVYVDVLKDSGRDYVSQFEGSALGK++24-40DSGRDYVSQFEGSALGK++28-40DYVSQFEGSALGK++46-59LLDNWDSVTSTFSK++60-77LREQLGPVTQEFWDNLEK++60-83LREQLGPVTQEFWDNLEKETEGLR++62-77EQLGPVTQEFWDNLEK++62-83EQLGPVTQEFWDNLEKETEGLR++97-106VQPYLDDFQK++97-107VQPYLDDFQKK++107-116KWQEEMELYRQK++108-116WQEEMELYRQK++117-131QKVEPLRAELQEGAR++119-131VEPLRAELQEGAR++119-133VEPLRAELQEGARQK++132-140QKLHELQEK++141-149LSPLGEEMR++141-151LSPLGEEMRDR++154-160ARAHVDAL++154-173ARAHVDALRTHLAPYSDELRQR++161-171THLAPYSDELR++189-195LAEYHAK++207-215AKPALEDLR++216-226QGLLPVLESFK+−216-239QGLLPVLESFKVSFLSALEEYTKK+−227-238VSFLSALEEYTK+−227-239VSFLSALEEYTKK+−a +, present; −, absent. Open table in a new tab Hydrolysis of the Fluorogenic Peptide Abz-ESFKVS-EDDnp by TTR—Different TTR preparations available in our laboratory were used to test the proteolytic cleavage of the Abz-ESFKVS-EDDnp fluorogenic peptide. All of the recombinant batches of protein, as well as the TTR isolated from plasma, retained the ability to cleave the fluorogenic peptide. In an attempt to establish a possible correlation between proteolysis and pathological or physiological processes, the preparations used included both wt or different TTR mutations related either to amyloidogenesis or to structural mutants with biological implications such as T4 binding. The following TTR mutants were used: (i) V30M, the most frequent mutation related to ATTR; (ii) L55P, which is associated with the most aggressive form of ATTR; (iii) T119M, a nonpathogenic variant shown to have a protective effect on the clinical evolution of the disease; and (iv) E92C and S117C, mutants designed with the purpose of stabilizing the dimer/tetramer interactions. TTR activity was apparently independent from these constraints (data not shown), suggesting that the conformational changes occurring either on amyloidogenic variants of the protein or in stabilized dimer/tetramer interactions do not compromise proteolytic activity. The optimum pH determined for TTR cleavage was 6.8; the same optimum pH was determined for cleavage of apoA-I (data not shown). The cleavage reaction of the fluorogenic peptide yielded a Km of 29 μm, as determined by Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 3A). The proteolytic activity of TTR preparations purified by HPLC was tested in each of the eluted fractions in activity assays using Abz-ESFKVS-EDDnp as substrat"

In the present work, we studied the effect of BDV infection on the response of hippocampal neurons, the main target for this virus, to the neurotrophin BDNF. We showed that persistent infection did not affect neuronal survival or morphology. However, it blocked BDNF-induced ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, despite normal expression of the TrkB BDNF receptor. In addition, BDNF-induced expression of synaptic vesicle proteins was abrogated, which resulted in severely impaired synaptogenesis and defects in synaptic organization. Thus, we provide the first evidence that a virus can interfere specifically with neurotrophin-regulated neuroplasticity, thereby hampering proper neuronal connectivity. These results may help to understand the behavioral disorders associated with BDV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2090257280,"A missense mutation of the insulin 2 gene (Cys96Tyr) in Akita mice disrupting one of the two interchain disulfide bonds results in intracellular accumulation of misfolded proinsulin. We analyzed the secretory pathway of pancreatic beta cells by electron microscopy and morphometry and identified sites of proinsulin accumulation by quantitative immunogold electron microscopy in this protein-folding disease. In Akita mice beta cells, the volume density of dilated endoplasmic reticulum subdomains was increased by 2.9-fold, resulting in a 1.7-fold increased volume density of the entire rough endoplasmic reticulum. The volume density of pre-Golgi intermediates was increased by 4.9-fold, and that of the Golgi apparatus was increase by 3.4-fold. The relative labeling intensity for proinsulin was 2.1-fold higher in dilated endoplasmic reticulum subdomains and 2.9-fold higher in pre-Golgi intermediates as compared with narrow endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in a significantly different distribution pattern between Akita and control mice beta cells (Chi2= 29.97, P<0.001). The numerical density of insulin secretory granules was equal in Akita and control mice beta cells. However, their volume density and average volume were reduced to 20% and their average diameter to 58% in Akita mice. Together, these data demonstrate that misfolded proinsulin accumulates mainly in pre-Golgi intermediates and to a lesser extent in dilated endoplasmic reticulum subdomains, providing evidence for the importance of pre-Golgi intermediates in a protein folding disease."

Certain Tocs and Tics were found to be tissue-specific. The protein composition of the transloci in the envelope membranes of chloroplasts was analyzed to describe the function and possible stoichiometry. In contrast to Tic subunits, several Toc subunits seem to have a high turnover. Most chloroplast proteins are nuclear-encoded and synthesized in the cytosol as preproteins with an N-terminal presequence (1Schleiff E. Soll J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Hetero-oligomeric machineries are required for translocation of preproteins across the chloroplast membranes. At least 13 envelope proteins are implicated in protein translocation and its regulation. Six proteins assist the translocation across the outer envelope (OE). 1The abbreviations used are: OE, outer envelope; IE, inner envelope; Toc and Tic, translocon in the outer and inner envelope of chloroplasts. 1The abbreviations used are: OE, outer envelope; IE, inner envelope; Toc and Tic, translocon in the outer and inner envelope of chloroplasts. Toc75 (Translocon in outer envelope of chloroplasts of 75 kDa) forms the translocation channel (2Hinnah S.C. Hill K. Wagner R. Schlicher T. Soll J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Toc34 and Toc159 are two GTPases with receptor function (3Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).Analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome revealed multiple isoforms for several translocon components (10Jackson-Constan D. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1667-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of Pisum sativum Toc34 (psToc34), namely A. thaliana Toc33 (atToc33) and atToc34, were identified (11Gutensohn M. Schulz B. Nicolay P. Flügge U.I. Plant J. 2000; 23: 771-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ppi1 A. thaliana plants, which have a loss of function mutation in atToc33, the homologue to psToc34, show a pale green phenotype in early developmental stages, whereas antisense plants of atToc34 do not differ from wild type. It was concluded that atToc33 can substitute for the atToc34 function but not vice versa (11Gutensohn M. Schulz B. Nicolay P. Flügge U.I. Plant J. 2000; 23: 771-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kubis S. Baldwin A. Patel R. Razzaq A. Dupree P. Lilley K. Kurth J. Leister D. Jarvis P. Plant Cell. 2003; 16: 1859-1871Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Toc34 and Toc33 show differential affinities for different precursor proteins in vitro (13Jelic M. Soll J. Schleiff E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5906-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The second GTPase, Toc159, functioning as a motor of translocation (14Schleiff E. Jelic M. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4604-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), has three isoforms: Toc132, Toc120, and Toc90 (15Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Alvarez-Huerta M. Kessler F. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Knocking out the atToc159 gene leads to defects in chloroplast biogenesis, which cannot be compensated by endogenous expression of other isoforms (16Bauer J. Chen K. Hiltbrunner A. Wehrli E. Eugster M. Schnell D. Kessler F. Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The functional differences of the Toc159 family remain elusive. For Toc75, four members of the gene family were proposed, namely Toc75-I, -III, -IV, and -V, and for Toc64, three members of the gene family are known, namely Toc64-I, -III, and -V. However, Toc64-V is clearly located in mitochondria and not in chloroplasts (17Chew O. Lister R. Qbadou S. Heazlewood J.L. Soll J. Schleiff E. Millar A.H. Whelan J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Some of the proteins were only predicted by in silico analysis, and little is known about the expression and stoichiometry of the subunits in plants. We therefore analyzed the gene expression as well as the protein levels in the envelope membrane to gain insights into possible functions of the proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGene Chip Analysis—RNA was extracted from 4-week-old wild type A. thaliana, and gene chip analysis of Affymetrix ATH1 arabidopsis genome chip (Affymetrix, High Wycombe, UK) was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Expression data were analyzed using the software provided by Affymetrix (MAS). The data for the diurnal gene expression were downloaded from affymetrix.arabidopsis-.info/narrays/experimentpage.pl?experimentid=60. The expression values of investigated gene products were normalized according to the highest expression observed. Then the difference of expression was calculated for all combinations of transcripts at each time point, and the absolute values of the differences were added.Protein Purification, Western Blot Analysis, and Quantification—Chloroplasts and chloroplast envelopes were prepared from pea (P. sativum) after 1 h of light treatment as described (18Schleiff E. Soll J. Küchler M. Kühlbrandt W. Harrer R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cloning and expression of the proteins used is described elsewhere (5Sohrt K. Soll J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Schleiff E. Jelic M. Soll J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6136-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, and references therein). Protein content of envelopes, organelles, and purified proteins was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad), and chloroplast content was analyzed by chlorophyll measurement. Defined amounts of purified proteins or proteins present in the envelopes or organelles were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and incubated with primary antibodies. Primary antibodies raised against His-tagged proteins were preincubated with His-tagged pSSU, sufficiently removing the subset of antibodies specific for the His tag epitope (data not shown). Proteins were visualized by alkaline phosphatase staining, and proteins were quantified after scanning of blots using AIDA image analysis software. Expressed protein dilution series served as a standard for comparison with envelope/chloroplast/amyloplast bands, thus enabling protein amount determination in those samples[32P]ATP and [32P]GTP Binding to Outer Envelope Proteins and DnaK—The binding of [32P]ATP and [32P]GTP to different amounts of OE proteins and of DnaK was performed as described (20Sveshnikova N. Soll J. Schleiff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4973-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the nucleotide binding was analyzed by phosphorimaging device. The molecular ratio between the GTP-loaded Toc34 and the ATP-loaded isHSP70 was quantified using AIDA software.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONGene Expression of the Toc Subunits in Green and Non-green Tissues—Photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic proteins were proposed to use different Toc33 and Toc159 isoforms (12Kubis S. Baldwin A. Patel R. Razzaq A. Dupree P. Lilley K. Kurth J. Leister D. Jarvis P. Plant Cell. 2003; 16: 1859-1871Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether differential gene expression of Toc isoforms in photosynthetically active and inactive tissues could be observed. The data show the highest expression levels for Toc159, Toc75-III, and Toc33 (Fig. 1A). These proteins form the core complex for translocation across the outer envelope (18Schleiff E. Soll J. Küchler M. Kühlbrandt W. Harrer R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Toc132, Toc 90, Toc34, Toc75-V, and the two isoforms of Toc64 showed a similar expression, which is lower than the expression of Toc75-III. Only Toc120 was further reduced, and no expression of Toc75-I and Toc75-IV could be detected.In roots, all genes analyzed were expressed with the exception of Toc75-IV and Toc75-I. A comparison of expression shows higher transcript levels of receptors Toc33, Toc159, and Toc64-III in leaves than in roots. This is in line with the pale or white phenotype of Toc33 or Toc159 knock-out mutants (12Kubis S. Baldwin A. Patel R. Razzaq A. Dupree P. Lilley K. Kurth J. Leister D. Jarvis P. Plant Cell. 2003; 16: 1859-1871Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Bauer J. Chen K. Hiltbrunner A. Wehrli E. Eugster M. Schnell D. Kessler F. Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Three proteins showed a significantly higher expression in roots than in leaves, namely Toc34, Toc132, and Toc120. None of these three isoforms was able to complement the knock-out either completely (in the case of Toc33 (11Gutensohn M. Schulz B. Nicolay P. Flügge U.I. Plant J. 2000; 23: 771-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kubis S. Baldwin A. Patel R. Razzaq A. Dupree P. Lilley K. Kurth J. Leister D. Jarvis P. Plant Cell. 2003; 16: 1859-1871Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar)) or at all (in the case of Toc159 (16Bauer J. Chen K. Hiltbrunner A. Wehrli E. Eugster M. Schnell D. Kessler F. Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar)) their respective isoform in leaves. The ratio of expression of Toc75 isoforms is similar in leaves and roots. Assuming that both isoforms are involved in preprotein translocation suggests that the specification of the complexes for photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic proteins is defined by the receptor components and not by the channel protein.A similar conclusion can be drawn from analysis of the diurnal gene expression (Fig. 1D). Gene expression of Toc75-III and Toc75-V do not differ drastically (dark area). The same was observed for Toc90/Toc159 and Toc120/Toc132 receptor pairs but not for other combinations of these receptors. Toc33 and Toc34 also differ drastically in their expression (white area). Again, the results point to dynamic Toc composition for preprotein recognition.Differences in the Presequence Architecture for Recognition by Toc33 and Toc34—Guided by the hypothesis of differential receptor function based on the gene expression data, we investigated the features of the presequences differentially recognized by Toc33 and Toc34. Due to the small number of proteins analyzed biochemically (13Jelic M. Soll J. Schleiff E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5906-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we analyzed chloroplast-targeted proteins differentially affected in their gene expression in the ppi1 background. We analyzed three pools of 100 nuclear-encoded, chloroplast-targeted proteins each, which are drastically up-, down-, or not regulated in the ppi1 mutant at the transcription level (12Kubis S. Baldwin A. Patel R. Razzaq A. Dupree P. Lilley K. Kurth J. Leister D. Jarvis P. Plant Cell. 2003; 16: 1859-1871Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We observed a difference in the signal lengths. The down-regulated preproteins contain a presequence, which is statistically about 10 amino acids shorter (∼45 amino acids) than up- and not regulated ones (∼55 amino acids, supplementary Fig. 1). The amino acid distribution of the first 30 N-terminal amino acids of the transit sequences shows that up-regulated preproteins exhibit a hydroxylated and proline-rich region from amino acids 20 to 30, whereas not regulated preproteins contain a positively charged and hydroxylated region from amino acids 18 to 26 (supplementary Fig. 2). The down-regulated ones are enriched in hydroxylated amino acids at the beginning of the sequence followed by hydrophobic residues ∼10 amino acids long (supplementary Fig. 2). These features are shared by the presequences of pre-ferredoxin: NADP+ oxidoreductase and pre-γ subunit of the chloroplast ATP synthetase, two proteins recognized with higher affinity by Toc33 than by Toc34 (13Jelic M. Soll J. Schleiff E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5906-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, experimental results suggest that Toc33/34 recognizes the C-terminal portion of the presequence (13Jelic M. Soll J. Schleiff E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5906-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Analysis of the 30 amino acids preceding the cleavage site revealed that preproteins recognized by Toc34 (up- and not regulated) again contain a highly hydroxylated region (Fig. 2), which is not as pronounced in Toc33-preferred presequences (down-regulated). Remarkably, these presequences contain positive charges at the -1 and -8 position. These results suggest that amino acid distribution in the presequence is directly connected with differential recognition by Toc34 homologues.Fig. 2Comparison of the C-terminal portion of presequences. A comparison of the 30 amino acids in the C terminus of the presequence of chloroplast-targeted proteins, which were up-, down-, or not regulated (n = 100) in ppi1 mutant A. thaliana plants, is shown. Boxes highlight regions of difference.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Gene Expression of the Tic Components—Analyzing the gene expression of the Tic components in leaves revealed that Tic55 and Tic110 are the most abundant transcripts. Only the Tic20-IV transcript could not be detected in leaves (Fig. 3A) but was found in roots (Fig. 3B). Tic55 is almost exclusively expressed in green tissue (Fig. 3, B and C). Tic40 is also predominantly expressed in green tissues. All other analyzed Tics are expressed almost similarly in leaves and in roots, with the exception of Tic20-IV. Diurnal expression patterns of the Tic proteins did not fluctuate with the exception of the two Tic20 isoforms (Fig. 3D). Comparing the expression of the Toc and Tic components revealed a 1.43-fold higher expression rate of Toc75-III in comparison with Tic110 in leaves and a 1.90-fold higher expression rate in roots. This might be explained as follows: the OE translocon has to translocate proteins aiming for the IE and for the stroma. Different routes may exist for these two compartments. However, due to the existence of the thylakoid system, containing the photosynthetically active proteins in chloroplasts, a higher translocation rate across the IE is required in comparison with amyloplasts, which do not contain thylakoids. This would lead to an increased Tic/Toc ratio in chloroplasts when compared with non-green plastids.Fig. 3Gene expression of Tic components. A and B, the gene expression of Tic components in leaves (A) and roots (B). C and D, the comparison between both (C) and diurnal changes (D) as described in the legend for Fig. 1 for the Toc proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Protein Level of the Toc and Tic Components—Differential expression levels might also reflect a differential stability of the proteins and might not directly correlate to protein content. Therefore we analyzed the protein concentration of the known Toc and Tic subunits in isolated envelope membranes (Fig. 4, lanes 1-3). For some of the subunits, the amount was also analyzed in amyloplasts (not shown) and chloroplasts (lanes 4-9). Serial dilutions of expressed proteins were used for quantitation (lanes 10-12). For the two channel-forming proteins, we observed 1.3 pmol of Tic110/μg of IE and 5.4 pmol of Toc75/μg of OE of chloroplasts (Table I). Taking into account that protein density in the IE is three times higher than in the OE (21Block M.A. Dorne A.J. Joyard J. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13281-13286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a ratio between Toc75 and Tic110 of 1.4 in chloroplasts can be calculated. This correlates well with the transcript ratio.Fig. 4Analysis of protein amounts. The analysis for quantification of an outer (Toc34, lanes 1-6) or inner envelope protein (Tic40, lanes 7-12) is shown as an example. In total, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, or 0.001 μg of protein (Prot., lanes 1-6 or 7-12), chloroplasts of 17, 5.1, 1.7, 0. 51, 0.17, or 0.051 μg of chlorophyll (Chlo., lanes 1-6 or 7-12), 11.6, 3.48, 1.16, 0.35, 0.12, or 0.035 μg of purified inner envelope (Env., lanes 7-12), or 7.18, 2.16, 0.72, 0.22, 0.072, or 0.022 μg of purified outer envelope (Env., lanes 1-6) were separated on SDS-PAGE followed by immunodecoration with indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IGene expression and protein ratio of the components of the plastid preprotein transloconTable IGene expression and protein ratio of the components of the plastid preprotein translocona The signal intensity of each transcript was normalized to the signal intensity of Toc75-III (Toc) or Tic110 (Tic).b Protein content (pmol/μg) in the OE or IE was determined and normalized to Toc75 (Toc) or Tic110 (Tic).c Determined by ATP and GTP labeling of the components as described under “Experimental Procedures.”d n.h., no homologue in A. thaliana identified at present.e n.p., no expressed or pure protein at present.The gene expression of Toc159 and Toc34, normalized to the expression level of Toc75-III, is 4-6 times higher than the protein content in relation to Toc75 (Table I). This could indicate decreased stability of the receptor proteins. Toc64, Toc12, and isHsp70 are less abundant than the other components. The amount of isHsp70 in the OE identified by SPA-820 antibodies (Fig. 5, lane 3) (7Schnell D.J. Kessler F. Blobel G. Science. 1994; 266: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) in comparison with Toc34 was determined by labeling with radioactive ATP and GTP (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 8). In addition to these three low abundant proteins, Tic22 could be detected in quantitative amounts in the outer envelope. This result points to a subcomplex architecture involving all four components. Such a complex can be isolated. 2E. Schleiff, unpublished information. The low abundance of these proteins might indicate a specialized function. Taking the proposal of Kouranov et al. (9Kouranov A. Chen X. Fuks B. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), this complex might translocate preproteins, which are then further translocated by the Tic20 pathway.Fig. 5Determination of the stoichiometry between isHsp70 and Toc34. Purified OE vesicles (Oev, 20 μg of protein) and 0.5 μg of DnaK were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie (lanes 1 and 2) or immunodecorated with SPA820 antibody after transfer to nitrocellulose (lane 3). [32P]ATP (lanes 4-7) or [32P]GTP (lanes 8 and 9) was cross-linked to Oev proteins and DnaK in the presence of either cold ATP (lanes 5, 7, and 8) or cold GTP (lane 4, 6, and 9). Radioactivity was visualized by a phosphorimaging device. Toc159, Toc34 and Hsp70 are marked. Molecular mass markers are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)For most of the Tic components, no significant alteration of the protein content profile in comparison with the gene expression profile could be observed. The only proteins drastically differing were Tic22 and Tic62. Tic22 was formerly described as a soluble intermembrane space protein, and here, only the membrane-associated protein and not the total protein content was quantified. In line with this observation, small amounts of the proteins were detected in the outer envelope. Tic62 is involved in redox regulation of protein translocation (19Küchler M. Decker S. Hörmann F. Soll J. Heins L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6136-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The reduced subunit ratio when compared with Tic110 might therefore represent a high turnover. Analyzing chloroplasts, we observed a similar protein ratio between the Toc components as in the OE (supplementary Table I). Furthermore, calculating the ratio between the amount of Tic components found in chloroplasts (supplementary Table I) and found in the IE (Table I) reveals a protein ratio between Toc75 and Tic110 of 1.4, which agrees with the estimation from the envelope protein content. The ratio between Toc75 and Tic110 in the envelope membranes might be explained by a pore structure composed of two or three Tic110 proteins or a second pathway requiring the action of Toc75 or Tic110 individually.The analysis of the protein level in amyloplasts revealed a higher protein level of Toc64 than Toc34. However, the gene expression of the two isoforms of Toc34 in A. thaliana (Table I) revealed a higher expression of the gene of atToc33, the homologue to Toc34 in P. sativum (13Jelic M. Soll J. Schleiff E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5906-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), in leaves in comparison with the gene expression of atToc34. In roots, the relationship of the expression is vice versa. Since we so far did not identify the second isoform in P. sativum, the cross-reactivity of the antibodies used with the second isoform is not confirmed. Therefore, the result might reflect that psToc34 is of low abundance in amyloplasts, which would be in line with the gene expression analysis. The protein ratio found for the Tic components investigated (supplementary Table I) are similar to the gene expression ratio found.Speculation—From the expression analysis, it can be speculated that two distinct receptor complexes exist. The first complex would be more specific for photosynthetic proteins, predominantly expressed in green tissues and composed of Toc159, Toc90, and Toc33. This would explain their existence in leaves (Fig. 1) and the observed phenotypes in ppi1 and ppi2 (12Kubis S. Baldwin A. Patel R. Razzaq A. Dupree P. Lilley K. Kurth J. Leister D. Jarvis P. Plant Cell. 2003; 16: 1859-1871Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Bauer J. Chen K. Hiltbrunner A. Wehrli E. Eugster M. Schnell D. Kessler F. Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The low expression level of Toc90, however, is consistent with the ppi2 phenotype. The second complex would be more specific for the housekeeping proteins and composed of Toc132, Toc120, and Toc34, explaining that both complexes coexist in the same tissues (Fig. 1). Their different preprotein recognition profile might be defined by differential targeting signals (Fig. 2). The large discrepancy between gene expression and protein levels of Toc34 and Toc159 leads to the question of whether these two proteins are less stable than the protein channel. Since both proteins face the cytosol and are phosphorylated, it might be that this event is involved in signaling for degradation. It could also be thought that both receptors are partly soluble and therefore not detectable in the membranes. However, this contradicts the current knowledge, especially on Toc34.From the protein ratio and from the gene expression data, it can be excluded that Tic20 forms the channel for stromal-targeted proteins (9Kouranov A. Chen X. Fuks B. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) since a 10-fold molar excess of Toc75 over Tic20 is present in chloroplasts. However, Tic20 might be involved in a translocation pathway of other proteins as suggested above. Most chloroplast proteins are nuclear-encoded and synthesized in the cytosol as preproteins with an N-terminal presequence (1Schleiff E. Soll J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Hetero-oligomeric machineries are required for translocation of preproteins across the chloroplast membranes. At least 13 envelope proteins are implicated in protein translocation and its regulation. Six proteins assist the translocation across the outer envelope (OE). 1The abbreviations used are: OE, outer envelope; IE, inner envelope; Toc and Tic, translocon in the outer and inner envelope of chloroplasts. 1The abbreviations used are: OE, outer envelope; IE, inner envelope; Toc and Tic, translocon in the outer and inner envelope of chloroplasts. Toc75 (Translocon in outer envelope of chloroplasts of 75 kDa) forms the translocation channel (2Hinnah S.C. Hill K. Wagner R. Schlicher T. Soll J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Toc34 and Toc159 are two GTPases with receptor function (3Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and Toc12 2E. Schleiff, unpublished information. 2E.

Science. 1994; 266: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The Tic complex is composed of seven components (1Schleiff E. Soll J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Tic110 acts as the protein translocation pore in the inner envelope (IE), and Tic55, Tic62, and Tic32 are involved in redox regulation of translocation (1Schleiff E. Soll J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). 3J. Soll, unpublished information. 3J. Soll, unpublished information. The functions of Tic40, Tic22, and Tic20 are less well defined. Tic40 shares homology to heat shock-associated proteins (8Stahl T. Glockmann C. Soll J. Heins L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37467-37472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), Tic22 might be a preprotein receptor in the intermembrane space, and Tic 20 might contribute to the translocation channel (9Kouranov A. Chen X. Fuks B. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome revealed multiple isoforms for several translocon components (10Jackson-Constan D. Keegstra K.

In this report, we studied the expression profiles of 159 genes in the rat nucleus accumbens during morphine exposure (14 days, 10 mg/kg s.c.) and drug-abstinence (3 weeks). We used real-time quantitative PCR to monitor gene expression after establishing its sensitivity and resolution to resolve small changes in expression for genes in various abundance classes. Morphine-exposure (5 time points) and subsequent abstinence (6 time points) induced phase-specific temporal gene expression of distinct functional groups of genes, for example, short-term homeostatic responses. Opiate withdrawal appeared to be a new stimulus in terms of gene expression and mediates a marked wave of gene repression. Prolonged abstinence resulted in persistently changed expression levels of genes involved in neuronal outgrowth and re-wiring. Our findings substantiate the hypothesis that this new gene program, initiated upon morphine-withdrawal, may subserve long-term neuronal plasticity involved in the persistent behavioral consequences of repeated drug-exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2025106039,"Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) is an essential enzyme because it catalyzes the formation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the principal biological methyl donor. Of the two genes that encode MAT, MAT1A is mainly expressed in adult liver and MAT2A is expressed in all extrahepatic tissues. Mice lacking MAT1A have reduced hepatic SAMe content and spontaneously develop hepatocellular carcinoma. The current study examined the influence of chronic hepatic SAMe deficiency on liver regeneration. Despite having higher baseline hepatic staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, MAT1A knockout mice had impaired liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH) as determined by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. This can be explained by an inability to up-regulate cyclin D1 after PH in the knockout mice. Upstream signaling pathways involved in cyclin D1 activation include nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB), the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3). At baseline, JNK and ERK are more activated in the knockouts whereas NFkappaB and STAT-3 are similar to wild-type mice. Following PH, early activation of these pathways occurred, but although they remained increased in wild-type mice, c-jun and ERK phosphorylation fell progressively in the knockouts. Hepatic SAMe levels fell progressively following PH in wild-type mice but remained unchanged in the knockouts. In culture, MAT1A knockout hepatocytes have higher baseline DNA synthesis but failed to respond to the mitogenic effect of hepatocyte growth factor. Taken together, our findings define a critical role for SAMe in ERK signaling and cyclin D1 regulation during regeneration and suggest chronic hepatic SAMe depletion results in loss of responsiveness to mitogenic signals."

Primary cluster analysis focused on mRNAs encoding matrix proteins and modulators of matrix turnover as classified by Onto-Compare and Gene Ontology and identified both molecules and pathways already implicated in the pathogenesis of TIF (e.g. transforming growth factor β1-CTGF-fibronectin-1 pathway) and novel TIF-associated genes (e.g. SPARC and Matrilin-2).

As with other proteinuric glomerulopathies, subsequent progressive loss of renal function is associated with the development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF). Proposed stimuli for TIF in this context include glomerular-derived proteinuria, inflammatory mediators, cytokines and growth factors, and tubulointerstitial ischemia secondary to glomerular capillary injury and obsolescence (2Anders H.J.

Several complementary lines of evidence from in vitro and in vivo experiments implicate transdifferentiation of tubule epithelial cells to fibroblast-like cells as a central event in this setting (6Okada H. Strutz F. Danoff T.M. Kalluri R. Neilson E.G. Contrib. Nephrol. 1996; 118: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Strutz F. Muller G.A. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2000; 15: 1729-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Whereas several macrostimuli for TIF have been defined in FSGS, there remains a dearth of knowledge with regard to the molecular basis of the fibrotic process and, in particular, with regard to the molecular events that drive epithelial cell dysfunction during TIF. The emergence of microarray technology, which allows large scale profiling of gene expression in biological systems has greatly enhanced our capacity to probe the molecular pathogenesis of renal injury. In this present study, using microarrays, changes in the renal transcriptome were monitored in a murine model of FSGS, namely adriamycin nephropathy, during the transition of the tubulointerstitium from an normal to a fibrotic phenotype. Through sequential biological function-focused and “baited”-global cluster analysis, a cohort of candidate modulators of TIF were identified, several of which were also modulated during epithelial-fibroblast transdifferentiation in vitro. Murine Model of Adriamycin Nephrosis in Vivo—Six-week-old male BALB/c mice were kept under standard conditions and were randomly allocated to either control or experimental groups. Murine adriamycin nephropathy was established by a single injection of adriamycin at a dose of 9.5 μg/g as previously reported (8Wang Y. Wang Y.P. Tay Y.C. Harris D.C. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1797-1804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Age-matched controls were injected with the same volume of isotonic saline. Adriamycin-treated animals were sacrificed at days 3, 7, 14, and 28 following injection. Cell Culture and Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transdifferentiation (EMT) in Vitro—Murine proximal tubular epithelial cells were grown in vitro in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, 1% penicillum, and 1% streptomycin as previously described (9Haverty T.P.

For EMT experiments, cells were serum starved in K-1 medium: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 1% glutamine, 1% penicillum, and 1% streptomycin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml selenium, and 36 ng/ml hydrocortisone. Murine proximal tubular cells were induced to undergo EMT by exposure to 3 ng/ml TGF-β1 and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor for 72 h according to the protocol of Strutz and Muller (7Strutz F. Muller G.A. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2000; 15: 1729-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Microarray Analysis—RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, in vitro transcription, and microarray analysis were preformed as previously reported (10Kieran N.E. Doran P.P. Connolly S.B. Greenan M.C.

Briefly, total RNA was isolated from whole kidneys at baseline and 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-injection of adriamycin and from murine proximal tubular cells in vitro using RNeasy Mini Column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using the Superscript Choice kit (Invitrogen). Biotin-labeled cRNA prepared from template cDNAs was fragmented and hybridized to the Affymetrix mu74av2 arrays as per the Affymetrix protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Arrays were then washed and fluorescently labeled prior to scanning with a confocal scanner (Affymetrix). All in vivo time points were microarrayed in triplicate (i.e. experimental triplicates). Image files were obtained through Affymetrix GeneChip software (MAS5). Subsequently robust multichip analysis (RMA) was performed (11Bolstad B.M. Irizarry R.A. Astrand M. Speed T.P.

As each in vivo time point was microarrayed in triplicate an average RMA value was computed to ensure that the average was statistically representative a t test and p values were generated. Only those genes with a p value of ≤0.01 were included in subsequent bioinformatic analysis (13Quackenbush J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 14Tusher V.G.

Thereafter, expression data for each time point was compared with control and a signal log ratio of 0.6 or greater (equivalent to a -fold change in expression of 1.5 or greater) was taken to identify significant differential regulation. Using normalized RMA values, cluster analysis was performed by Eisen's program (15Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Initially all the genes under study are assessed and the two closest genes are joined creating the first node. Subsequent nodes are determined and added by the pairwise joining of genes, based on the distance between them, culminating in all genes belonging to the one node (15Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T.

To ensure tight cluster analysis and reduce the background noise that accompanies microarray experiments the 12,488 genes of the Affymetrix mu74av2 chip were filtered to remove genes with very low expression at all time points (16Ross D.T.

An initial cluster analysis of each individual array and the average array for each time point was performed to ensure that each time point was sufficiently similar in expression profiles to permit the use of average values thereafter. A list of 200 extracellular matrix proteins or modulators of matrix turnover was curated via the publicly available Onto-Compare and Gene Ontology (GO) data bases (18Consortium Gene Ontology Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 19Draghici S.

When individual and computed average microarrays were clustered there was strong alignment to their respective time point as illustrated in Fig. 2, panel A. Of the 12,488 gene sequences expressed on the Affymetrix mu74av2 oligonucleotide microarray 1.7 (211 genes), 1.8 (228 genes), 2.1 (368 genes), and 6.8% (852 genes) were perturbed at days 3, 7, 14, and 28 following adriamycin injection, respectively. Tables I and II highlight the genes whose mRNA levels changed most dramatically at days 3, 7, 14, and 28.Fig. 2Global changes in gene expression in FSGS and patterns of changes in gene expression in the major functional families. Each time point was assessed in triplicate using the mu74av2 Affymetrix microarray, which displays 12,488 transcripts. Panel A illustrates hierarchical cluster analysis of individual and average arrays, as can be seen by array clusters according to the disease time point. Panel B summarizes the global changes in gene expression with a signal log ratio (SLR) of ≥+0.6 defining up-regulation and a SLR ≤-0.6 defining down-regulation of individual genes.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 summarizes the global changes in gene expression (panel B) and the pattern of change within major gene families, classified on the basis of known function (panel C). Interestingly, whereas adriamycin induced robust changes in functional classes that correlate with the typical histopathological phenotype (e.g. inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis, and matrix proteins), striking changes were also noted in cohorts of developmental and metabolism genes not classically associated with nephropathy and TIF. With the exception of inflammatory/immune genes, which peaked earlier, gene expression levels were most strikingly increased when moving between day 14 (269 mRNA transcripts significantly up-regulated) and day 28 (661 mRNA transcripts significantly up-regulated) (Fig. 2, panel B), a phase characterized by a shift in the disease from a predominantly glomerular phenotype with proteinuria and mild renal dysfunction to establish tubulointerstitial fibrosis and chronic renal failure (Fig. 1). Whereas the temporal pattern was less striking with regard to down-regulated genes, maximal disturbance was again noted at day 28. Mathematically “tight” clusters of genes following perturbation of biological systems can infer a commonality of function or regulation (15Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl.

In the present study the expression profile of 200 known ECM proteins and modulators of ECM turnover was first assessed with unsupervised hierarchical clustering, thereby defining the major patterns of expression within this functional class during adriamycin nephropathy (“Primary ECM-focused Cluster Analysis”). Genes within these major ECM clusters were then used as bait to probe the remainder of the transcriptome and identify other genes with similar patterns of expression (“Secondary Baited-Global Cluster Analysis”). For primary cluster analysis 200 genes that encode for either ECM proteins or modulators of ECM turnover were selected using Gene Ontology and Onto-Compare (18Consortium Gene Ontology Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 19Draghici S. Khatri P. Bhavsar P. Shah A. Krawetz S.A. Tainsky M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3775-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Those genes with low expression at all time points were removed as previously described, resulting in average linkage unsupervised hierarchical analysis of 81 ECM genes and the identification of four prominent patterns of gene expression (Fig. 3). Identification of SPARC, Tenascin-C and Fibrillin-1 among Major Clusters of Up-regulated Genes in TIF—Two clusters (Fig. 3, primary clusters A and B) were characterized by a striking increase in mRNA levels at day 28. The first (Cluster A) included induced TGF-β, several members of the collagen superfamily (Col1α1, Col1α2, Col3α1, Col4α1, Col4α2, Col8α1, Col15α1, and Col18α1), matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12), fibronectin-1, and decorin. Also of interest was SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), which along with tenascin C and thrombospondin-1, are members of a family of secreted regulatory proteins that modulate interactions between cells and the ECM (23Francki A. Sage E.H. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2001; 11: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). They are expressed in vivo during development and during tissue remodeling following injury, consistent with the emerging paradigm highlighted again in this study (Fig. 2, panel C), that many developmental programs are recapitulated in the context of fibrosis and repair. SPARC is found in a wide variety of cell types where it inhibits proliferation, focal adhesion, and prevents cell spreading in vitro (24Motamed K. Funk S.E. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E.W. Sage E.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consistent with the current study, increased SPARC mRNA expression has been shown in experimental models of Heyman nephritis, mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, and diabetic nephropathy (25Floege J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32145-32152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) demonstrated that SPARC regulated both TGF-β1 and type I collagen production in mesangial cells, which is particularly interesting given that SPARC clustered alongside type I collagens (Col1α1 and Col1α2) and TGF-β1 (Primary Cluster A) in this in vivo model of TIF (28Francki A.

Together this data supports the suggestion that SPARC promotes ECM production and deposition by regulating type I collagen expression through TGF-β1-dependent pathways. The second cluster of genes up-regulated at day 28 (Fig. 3, Primary Cluster B) included TGF-β1, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), the matrix protein type VI collagen (Col6α1 and Col6α3), tenascin C, and fibulin-1. Consistent with the hypothesis that cluster analysis can identify genes whose regulation or function is linked, CTGF is induced by TGF-β1 and promotes ECM production by fibroblasts and indeed resident renal cells (29Gupta S. Clarkson M.R. Duggan J. Brady H.R. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Increased tenascin C expression is noteworthy as overexpression of tenascin C is associated with disruption of cell adhesion and migration in non-renal systems (21Atula T. Hedstrom J. Finne P. Leivo I. Markkanen-Leppanen M. Haglund C. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 3051-3056PubMed Google Scholar, 30Jahkola T. Toivonen T. Virtanen I. von Smitten K. Nordling S. von Boguslawski K. Haglund C. Nevanlinna H. Blomqvist C. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In keeping with an emerging role for tenascin C in renal disease, tenascin C expression is limited to the medullary interstitium in normal kidney, whereas marked tenascin C expression has been reported in the context of human tubulointerstitial inflammation or fibrosis in a variety of pathological conditions (31Truong L.D. Foster S.V. Barrios R. D'Agati V. Verani R.R. Gonzalez J.M. Suki W.N. Nephron. 1996; 72: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As with TGF-β the clustering of tenascin C with CTGF was remarkable given that CTGF has been shown to induce tenascin C in human tubule epithelial cells in vitro again supporting a role for tenascin C in TIF (32Gore-Hyer E.

The finding of fibulin-1 in this cluster was also intriguing given that this fibrillar ECM protein binds to a host of basement membrane proteins including fibronectin, fibrillin, laminins, and collagens, several of which were also represented in this cluster (33Timpl R. Sasaki T. Kostka G. Chu M.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Fibulin-1 interacts with fibronectin in vitro to inhibit cell motility of mesenc"

https://openalex.org/W2026195376,"We have recently shown that phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) is activated by the central repeated units (CRUs) of the AHNAK protein in the presence of arachidonic acid. Here we demonstrate that four central repeated units (4 CRUs) of AHNAK act as a scaffolding motif networking PLC-γ and PKC-α. Specifically, 4 CRUs of AHNAK bind and activate PKC-α, which in turn stimulates the release of arachidonic acid near where PLC-γ1 is localized. Moreover, 4 CRUs of AHNAK interacted with PLC-γ and the concerted action of 4 CRUs with arachidonic acid stimulated PLC-γ activity. Stimulation of NIH3T3 cells expressing 4 CRUs of AHNAK with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate resulted in the increased generation of total inositol phosphates (IPT) and mobilization of the intracellular calcium. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-dependent generation of IPT was completely blocked in NIH3T3 cells depleted of PLC-γ1 by RNA interference. Furthermore, bradykinin, which normally stimulated the PLC-β isozyme resulting in the generation of a monophasic IPT within 30 s in NIH3T3 cells, led to a biphasic pattern for generation of IPT in NIH3T3 cells expressing 4 CRUs of AHNAK. The secondary activation of PLC is likely because of the scaffolding activity of AHNAK, which is consistent with the role of 4 CRUs as a molecular linker between PLC-γ and PKC-α.

AHNAK, a nuclear phosphoprotein with the estimated molecular mass of 700 Da, was originally identified in human neuroblastomas and skin epithelial cells (1Shtivenman E. Cohen F.E. Bishop J.M. Proc.

AHNAK contains three distinct structural regions: the NH2-terminal 251-amino acid region, a large central region of about 4300 amino acids with 36 repeated units, and the COOH-terminal 1002 amino acids region. The carboxyl-terminal region of AHNAK proteins was reported to play an important role in cellular localization and in interaction with L-type Ca2+ channels in cardiac cells (4Hohaus A. Person V.

In low calcium concentrations, AHNAK proteins are mainly localized in the nucleus, but the increase in intracellular calcium levels leads the protein to translocate to plasma membrane (3Hashimoto T.

The central repeated unit in AHNAK is 128 amino acids in length and displays a heptasequence motif, (D/E)φΩφK(A/G)P, where φ and Ω represent hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid residues, respectively.

PLC catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG). To date, a total of 11-different isozymes of PLC have been identified in mammalian cells, and these can be classified into four subfamilies, β (β1-β4), γ (γ1 and γ2), δ (δ1-δ4), and ϵ isozymes. Based on their primary structures, this classification has been correlated with their different activation mechanisms (7Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Although protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK)-mediated PLC-γ isozyme activation is well established, lipid-derived second messengers such as phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate, and arachidonic acid (AA) were also proposed to activate the isozyme (7Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Furthermore, concerted action of arachidonic acid with tau or with repeated units of AHNAK was also shown to stimulate the activation of PLC-γ isozymes (8Hwang S.C. Jhon D.Y. Bae Y.S. Kim J.H.

The 11 PKC isozymes thus far identified display diverse tissue expression, subcellular localization, cofactor requirements, and functional diversity (10Kikkawa U. Kishimoto A. Nishizuka Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 11Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 12Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S.

The PKC isozymes can be classified into three groups according to their regulatory properties, which are in turn governed by the presence of specific domains in the proteins. The conventional PKCs include PKCα, βI, βII, and γ, and these isoforms can be activated by Ca2+ and/or by DAG and phorbol esters. The novel PKCs, δ, ϵ, θ, and η, can also be activated by DAG and phorbol esters but are Ca2+-independent. The atypical PKCs, which include PKCξ and PKCι, are unresponsive to Ca2+ and DAG/phorbol esters. It has been established that PKC isozymes activate the Raf-MAPK cascade and NF-κB as downstream molecules in cell signaling (14Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Rennert P. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes hydrolyze fatty acid from the sn-2 position of phospholipid with the concomitant production of lysophospholipid. Mammalian cells contain structurally diverse forms of PLA2 including secretory PLA2, calcium-independent PLA2, and the 85-kDa cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2). It has been reported that AA is produced in response to diverse stimuli including interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, epidermal growth factor, okadaic acid, the phagocytic particle zymosan, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (15Kramer R.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20146-20156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These reports indicate that AA, a product of PLA2, plays the role not only of an important initiator of inflammatory processes but also of a regulator of signaling process (16Gijón M.A. Leslie C.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Although 4 central repeated units (CRUs) of the AHNAK protein bind and activate PLC-γ in vitro, the cellular function of the CRUs in AHNAK is not clear. Our results suggest that the 4 CRUs of AHNAK concomitantly interact with PKC-α and PLC-γ in response to PMA. It is likely that PKC-α in a ternary complex translocates to the membrane and then induces the release of AA through cPLA2 activation. Once released, AA likely activates PLC-γ through a concerted action with AHNAK. Taken together, these results indicate that 4 CRUs of AHANK act as a scaffolding protein networking for PLC-γ and PKC-α. Materials—[5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]Arachidonic acid (189 Ci/mmol) and myo-[2-3H]inositol were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

MACSelect KK MicroBeads were obtained from Miltenyi Biotec, and SuperFect was purchased from Qiagen. The anti-HA, anti-PKC-β3, and anti-PKC-α monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Roche Diagnostics, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively. Cell Cultures—NIH3T3 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum. COS-7 and TV1 null cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids—Human AHNAK cDNA was obtained by screening the human male BAC library. The division of AHNAK into N (amino acid residues 1-257), C1 (amino acid residues 4640-5386), and C2 (amino acid residues 5258-5643) domains was based on a previously published report (4Hohaus A. Person V. Behlke J. Schaper J. Morano I. Hasse H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragments were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pcDNA3-HA vector by digestion with EcoRI and XhoI. The gene for 4 CRUs of AHNAK (amino acid residues 3860-4412) was subcloned into pcDNA3-HA by digestion with EcoRI and XhoI. The gene for 4 CRUs of AHNAK was also obtained by PCR and inserted into pEGFP-N1 and pDsRed-C1 (Clontech) by digestion with XhoI and HindIII and HindIII and BamHI, respectively. All constructs were checked by restriction site mapping and sequencing. Transfection—NIH3T3 cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates. The cells were transfected with 4 μg of pcDNA3, pcDNA3-HA-AHNAK-N, pcDNA3-HA-4CRUs, pcDNA3-HA-C1, pcDNA3-HA-C2, pDsRed-C1, or pDsRed-C1-4CRUs using SuperFect reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol and maintained in the completed medium for 24 h. The cells were serum-starved for 12 h and then stimulated with various agonists for the indicated times. Release of Arachidonic Acid—NIH3T3 cells (2.5 × 105) were plated at 6-well plates. The cells were cultured for 24 h and labeled by incubation for 16 h in 1 ml of serum-free medium containing [3H]arachidonic acid (0.5 μCi/ml) and 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. The cells were then washed twice with DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 100 nm PMA in the absence or presence of 10 μm A23187 for 10 min. Radioactivity in the supernatant fractions and the cell lysates containing 1% Triton X-100 were measured by liquid scintillation counting. The percentage of arachidonic acid release was calculated as the (medium cpm/(cells + medium) cpm) × 100 and then normalized to the value of unstimulated controls (18Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y.

Measurement of Total Inositol Phosphate (IPT) in Cells—NIH3T3 cells were labeled with inositol-free DMEM supplemented with myo-[2-3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml, 25 mCi/mmol) (DuPont Biotechnology Systems) for 14 h and then washed with inositol-free DMEM (20Bae Y.S.

The cells were subsequently incubated in DMEM containing 20 mm LiCl for 30 min and stimulated with 100 nm PMA for 10 min or stimulated with 1 μm bradykinin for the indicated time. To inhibit PKC activity, the cells were treated with 5 μm GF109203X for 10 min followed by 100 nm PMA for 10 min. To inhibit Src and epidermal growth factor receptor activity, the cells were pretreated with 10 μm PP-1, 1 μm AG1478 for 30 min and then stimulated with 1 μm bradykinin for the indicated time periods. The incubation was terminated by adding perchloric acid to a final concentration of 5% (w/v). The cells were scraped into Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was equilibrated with 2 m KOH, 1 mm EDTA and applied to a SAX column connected to a high performance liquid chromatograph (Hewlett Packard series 1100). Bound inositol phosphates were eluted by applying a linear gradient (0-1.0 m ammonium phosphate) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Radioactivity in the resulting fraction, corresponding to liberated [3H]IPT, was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Magnetic Enrichment of NIH3T3 Cells Expressing AHNAK—NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected pMACS KK with pcDNA3-HA or pcDNA3-HA-4CRUs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without EDTA. The cells were again incubated with 500 μl of trypsin solution per 100-mm dish until dissociated from culture dish and from each other. Trypsinization was stopped by adding 100 μl of 100% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then incubated with 80 μl of MACSelect KK MicroBeads per 100-mm dish for 15 min at room temperature and PBS containing 2 mm EDTA and 0.5% fetal bovine serum was added to a final volume of 2 ml. The cells expressing MACS KK protein were separated from magnetic columns, plated on 6-well plates, and allowed to recover for 24 h. The cells were subsequently incubated for 18 h in inositol-free DMEM supplemented with myo-[3H]inositol (1.5 μCi/ml, 25 mCi/mmol) (DuPont), and processed as described above. Measurement of Intracellular Calcium ([Ca2+]i)—[Ca2+]i was measured using a laser scanning confocal microscope (21Lee Z.W. Kweon S.M. Kim B.C. Leem S.H. Shin I.C. Kim J.H. Ha K.S. J. Biol.

Transfected or nontransfected NIH3T3 cells were serum-starved for 12 h, incubated with 2 μm Fluo-4/AM in serum-free medium for 40 min, and washed three times with Ca2+-free Locke's solution (158.4 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES buffer adjusted to pH 7.3, 10 mm glucose, and 0.2 mm EGTA). The coverslips containing the stained cells were mounted on a perfusion chamber (21Lee Z.W. Kweon S.M. Kim B.C. Leem S.H. Shin I.C. Kim J.H. Ha K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12710-12715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and subjected to confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis (Olympus LV300). Prior to observing the release of real calcium in response to PMA, NIH3T3 cells expressing red fluorescence protein-tagged AHNAK were pre-selected through scanning with 543- and 560-nm emission filters and scanned every second with a 488-nm excitation argon laser and a 515-nm long pass emission filter. A solution containing 100 nm PMA was then added to the cells with an automatic pumping system (21Lee Z.W. Kweon S.M. Kim B.C. Leem S.H. Shin I.C. Kim J.H. Ha K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12710-12715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). About 150 images resulting from the scanning were analyzed for changes of [Ca2+]i at a single cell level. The results were expressed as relative fluorescence intensity. Construction of Small Interfering RNA (SiRNA) for PLC-γ1—Specific sequences of 19-nucleotide sequence (ctactactctgaggagacc, residues 1695 to 1713) of the human PLC-γ1 cDNA were selected for synthesis of a siRNA. pSUPER vector for siRNA was purchased from Oligoengine (22Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the pSUPER vector with BglII (5′ end) and HindIII (3′ end). Cells were transfected with the resulting construct and cultured for 48 h in complete medium. The transfected cells were deprived of serum for 12 h, incubated for 10 min in the absence or presence of PMA or for the indicated times in the absence or presence of bradykinin, and then analyzed by measurement of total inositol phosphates. The depletion of endogenous PLC-γ1 by the siRNA was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Immunofluorescence—COS-7 cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with pEGFP-N1-4CRUs. The cells were serum-starved for 12 h, stimulated with 100 nm PMA for 10 min, washed with cold PBS, fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100. Nonspecific sites were blocked by treating the cells with PBS containing 0.05% gelatin and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies against PKC-α or PLC-γ in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody (TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse-IgG), and then mounted on glass slides using a drop of Aqua-Poly/mount. Images were recorded using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss 510). GST Fusion Protein Binding Assays—Cultures of Escherichia coli BL21 containing pGEX4T1 and pGEX4T1-4CRUs were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. The harvested bacteria were suspended in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (0.1 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The samples were washed three times with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and subjected to immunoblot analyses. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Lysates (1-2 × 106 cells) were mixed with antibodies (0.5-1 μg) for 4 h, followed by addition of 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed five times with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10% glycerol). After boiling 2 times in sample buffer, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were immunoblotted with the indicated primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibodies. Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. PMA Stimulates PLC-γ Activation in NIH3T3 Cells Expressing Four Central Repeated Units of AHNAK—In a previous report (9Sekiya F. Bae Y.S. Jhon D.Y. Hwang S.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13900-13907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we have shown that AHNAK binds and activates PLC-γ in the presence of AA. To verify the cellular function of the AHNAK protein as an activator of PLC-γ, we first identified an agonist that can generate AA in cells. It is known that PMA, a known PKC activator, can activate cPLA2 and then release AA in various cell types (23Qiu Z.-H. Gijón M.A. de Carvalho M.S. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8203-8211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were labeled with [3H]AA, and the cPLA2 activity was monitored by measuring the release of [3H]AA to the supernatant in the absence or presence of PMA stimulation. Stimulation of the cell with PMA resulted in the maximal release of [3H]AA within 30 min followed by a gradual decrease to basal level (Fig. 1). To determine whether AHNAK can activate PLC-γ in response to PMA, we transiently expressed the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged AHNAK (HA-AHNAK) derivative in NIH3T3 cells and measured the production of IPT as an indicator of PLC activity. The large size of AHNAK makes it virtually impossible to express the full-length of the protein, AHNAK was divided into three domains based on sequence analysis and functional studies previously reported (4Hohaus A. Person V. Behlke J. Schaper J. Morano I. Hasse H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Sekiya F. Bae Y.S. Jhon D.Y. Hwang S.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13900-13907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); HA-N (amino acids 1-257), HA-4CRUs (amino acids 3859-4412), HA-C1 (amino acids 4640-5386), and HA-C2 (amino acids 5258-5643) (Fig. 2A). We found that PMA stimulated IPT production in cells expressing HA-4CRUs by 150% but not in those expressing other regions of AHNAK (Fig. 2B). Moreover, inhibition of PKC activity by pretreatment of the cells with GF109203X abrogated production of IPT in cells expressing HA-4CRUs. These results suggest that PKC might be involved in the AHNAK-dependent activation of PLC. The rather modest level increase in IPT generation by PMA in NIH3T3 cells is mostly likely because HA-4CRUs transfection efficiency is low. To confirm the effect of AHNAK on PLC activation, we transfected NIH3T3 cells with HA-4CRUs and pMACS KK, which encodes truncated mouse H-2Kk protein, thus allowing enrichment of cells expressing HA-4CRUs using the MACSelect KK magnetic bead. Incubation of the selected cells expressing the HA-4CRU protein with PMA resulted in an increase of IPT generation by 7-fold (Fig. 2D). We next examined whether PMA can trigger intracellular Ca2+ mobilization ([Ca2+]i) in NIH3T3 cells expressing 4 CRUs of AHNAK. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with RFP-4CRU and the intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured by laser-based confocal microscopy with Fluo-4 dye. PMA failed to mobilize intracellular calcium in untransfected cells, whereas stimulation of NIH3T3 cells expressing RFP-4CRU with PMA resulted in a rapid and transient increase of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that AHNAK is involved in production of IPT and mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ in response to PMA. To prove the selectivity for PLC-γ1 in AHNAK-mediated IPT generation, we subjected NIH3T3 cells to transient transfection with pSUPER-PLC-γ1 encoding a siRNA specific for the PLC-γ1 gene (22Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). The cells transfected with the siRNA vector exhibited a marked reduction in the abundance of the endogenous PLC-γ1 protein compared with cells transfected with the empty pSUPER vector (Fig. 3A). NIH3T3 cells transfected with the pSUPER-PLC-γ1 vector failed to generate IPT in response to PMA, whereas the cells transfected with pSUPER alone exhibited a marked increase of IPT generation in response to PMA stimulation, suggesting that generation of IPT results from AHNAK-mediated activation of PLC-γ1 (Fig. 3A). The central role of PLC-γ1 in AHNAK-mediated IPT generation was further demonstrated in PLC-γ1-null fibroblasts (TV1-null) (24Ji Q.-S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Expression of 4 CRUs of AHNAK in PLC-γ1-null fibroblasts failed in IPT generation in response to PMA, whereas add-back expression of PLC-γ1 in the fibroblast cells expressing 4 CRUs of AHNAK restored PMA-dependent IPT generation (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that the PLC-γ1 isozyme plays the central role in PMA-induced IPT generation in the presence of AHNAK. Central Repeated Units of the AHNAK Protein Interact with PLC-γ in Response to PMA—We previously demonstrated a direct interaction between AHNAK and PLC-γ1 in an AA-dependent manner in vitro but did not establish whether PMA can induce 4 CRUs of the AHNAK-PLC-γ1 complex formation in cells. To address this question, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with monoclonal antibodies against HA. Cells expressing the HA-4CRUs protein were either unstimulated or stimulated with PMA for 10 min and then lysed in a buffer containing nonionic detergent. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody and examined by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies against PLC-γ1, PLC-β1, PLC-β3, and PLC-δ1, respectively. PLC-β3 is the predominantly expressed PLC-β isozyme in NIH3T3 cells. The 4 CRUs of the AHNAK protein interacted with PLC-γ in a PMA-dependent manner, whereas other isozymes failed to interact with AHNAK (Fig. 4A). To investigate whether platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates the interaction of 4 CRUs of AHNAK with PLC-γ1, NIH3T3 cells expressing the HA-4CRU protein were either unstimulated or stimulated with PDGF for 10 min and then lysed in a buffer containing nonionic detergent. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against HA and examined by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies against PLC-γ1. The result indicates that 4 CRUs of the AHNAK protein failed to interact with PLC-γ1 in response to PDGF suggesting that AHNAK mediates PTK-independent PLC-γ activation (Fig. 4B). Moreover, we have observed colocalization of PLC-γ1 with AHNAK in response to PMA. Endogenous PLC-γ and GFP-4CRU were located in the cytoplasm and perinuclear regions in resting cells, whereas GFP-4CRU was co-localized with PLC-γ in plasma membrane (arrow) and the perinuclear region in response to PMA stimulation (Fig. 4C). Asterisks indicate NIH3T3 cells untransfected with 4 CRUs of AHNAK. Plasma membrane localization of PLC-γ in response to PMA was not observed in untransfected NIH3T3 cells (indicated by asterisks). Results from immunoprecipitation experiments and confocal microscopy indicate that PMA induces formation of the AHNAK-PLCγ complex in the plasma membrane. Central Repeated Units of AHNAK Protein Interact with PKC Isozyme—Because NIH3T3 cells appear to mainly express the PKC-α isozyme (25Goodnight J. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mushinaski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9991-10001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), we employed co-immunoprecipitation experiments and confocal microscopy experiments to investigate molecular interaction between 4 CRUs of AHNAK and PKC-α. We have observed that PKC-α interacts with 4 CRUs of AHNAK in response to PMA stimulation in a GST pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 5, A and B). To examine co-localization of 4 CRUs of AHNAK with PKC-α in cells, we performed confocal microscopy with cells expressing GFP-4CRUs. PKC-α was stained with antibody against PKC-α. GFP-4CRUs and PKC-α were dispersed in the cytoplasm in the absence of PMA, whereas GFP-4CRU (arrow) was co-localized with endogenous PKC-α (arrow) in plasma membrane upon PMA stimulation (Fig. 5C"
https://openalex.org/W2023897728,"Bcl-2 promotes oncogenesis by inhibiting cell death. Bcl-2 also inhibits proliferation and suppresses tumorigenesis in some settings. To clarify the role of the antiproliferative function of Bcl-2, mice expressing a mutant form of Bcl-2 reported to lack antiproliferative activity were generated (tyrosine 28 to alanine, Bcl-2-Y28A). As expected, both wild type (WT) and Bcl-2-Y28A inhibited apoptosis similarly. In contrast to previous results in cell lines, Bcl-2-Y28A inhibited T-cell proliferation identical to WT-Bcl-2. Significantly, both Bcl-2-Y28A and WT-Bcl-2 inhibited proliferation of T cells isolated from older animals, but not proliferation of T cells from immature mice. Instead, inhibition of cell activation correlated with T-cell size, p27 levels, and RNA content, all indicators of quiescent G0 arrest. Consistent with this model, Bcl-2 inhibition of T-cell proliferation was reversed by expression of Bax, again correlating cell proliferation with cell size. These experiments do not support genetically separate effects of Bcl-2 on apoptosis and proliferation. Instead, the data support a model in which Bcl-2 and Bax regulate T-cell proliferation by changes in T-cell size and by increasing the markers of quiescent G0 arrest. These changes likely result from prolonged T-cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2128002624,"Mutations in the gene GJB2, encoding the gap junction protein Connexin26 (Cx26), are the most prevalent cause of inherited hearing loss, and Cx26M34T was one of the first mutations linked to deafness (Kelsell et al., 1997; Nature 387, 80-83). We report the first characterization of the gating properties of M34T, which had previously been reported to be nonfunctional. Although homotypic mutant channels did not produce detectable currents, heterotypic pairings with wtCx26 confirmed that M34T formed intercellular channels, although the gating properties were altered. Cx26M34T displayed an inverted response to transjunctional voltage (Vj), mediating currents that activate in a time- and Vj-dependent manner. These characteristics suggest that the channel population is only partially open at rest, consistent with previous reports that dye transfer in M34T-expressing cells is reduced or abolished (e.g., Thonnissen et al., Human Genet. 111, 190-197). To investigate the controversial recessive/dominant behavior of this mutant, we coexpressed M34T with wtCx26 RNA at equimolar levels, mimicking the situation in heterozygotic individuals. Under these conditions, M34T did not significantly reduce Cx26/Cx26 coupling, or alter the electrophysiological properties of the wt channels, consistent with the recessive nature of the allele. Overexpression of the mutant did have some inhibitory effects on conductance, possibly explaining some of the previous reports in exogenous expression systems and some patients. Consistent with its electrophysiological behavior, we also show that M34T localizes to cell junctions in both transfected HeLa cells and patient-derived tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2032315452,"Nitric oxide (NO) produced by inducible nitric-oxide synthase (NOSII) is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level by the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). In the present study, we further analyzed the role of NF-κB in the in vivo transcriptional regulation of NOSII gene by comparing two clones isolated from the EMT-6 mouse mammary cancer cell line. In response to interleukin (IL)-1β or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), EMT-6 clone J (EMT-6J) cells produce 3-fold more NO than EMT-6 clone H (EMT-6H) cells, an effect correlated with enhanced activation of NF-κB in EMT-6J cells. In response to IL-1β, the kinetics of degradation of NF-κB inhibitors IκB-α and IκB-β, the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of the transcription factor and its binding to a specific DNA sequence were similar in both clones. In contrast, an IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of serine residues in NF-κB p65 subunit was observed in EMT-6J, but not in EMT-6H, cells. This IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of p65 was specifically prevented by pretreatment of EMT-6J cells with the casein kinase II inhibitor DRB. Small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of casein kinase II-α subunit also decreased NF-κB transcriptional activity and NOSII gene transcription in IL-1β and LPS-stimulated EMT-6J cells to the levels observed in EMT-6H cells treated in the same conditions. Altogether, these data indicate that casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation of p65 subunit can enhance the transcriptional activity of NF-κB in vivo. This post-translational modification of the transcription factor can be responsible for increased NOSII gene transcription and NO production in tumor cells exposed to either IL-1β or LPS. Nitric oxide (NO) produced by inducible nitric-oxide synthase (NOSII) is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level by the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). In the present study, we further analyzed the role of NF-κB in the in vivo transcriptional regulation of NOSII gene by comparing two clones isolated from the EMT-6 mouse mammary cancer cell line. In response to interleukin (IL)-1β or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), EMT-6 clone J (EMT-6J) cells produce 3-fold more NO than EMT-6 clone H (EMT-6H) cells, an effect correlated with enhanced activation of NF-κB in EMT-6J cells. In response to IL-1β, the kinetics of degradation of NF-κB inhibitors IκB-α and IκB-β, the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of the transcription factor and its binding to a specific DNA sequence were similar in both clones. In contrast, an IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of serine residues in NF-κB p65 subunit was observed in EMT-6J, but not in EMT-6H, cells. This IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of p65 was specifically prevented by pretreatment of EMT-6J cells with the casein kinase II inhibitor DRB. Small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of casein kinase II-α subunit also decreased NF-κB transcriptional activity and NOSII gene transcription in IL-1β and LPS-stimulated EMT-6J cells to the levels observed in EMT-6H cells treated in the same conditions.

Fibroblasts that are heterogeneous with respect to the surface expression of Thy-1 differ markedly in morphology, cytoskeletal organization, and migration, suggesting differential regulation of focal adhesion dynamics. Here we demonstrate that disassembly of focal adhesions mediated by both full-length thrombospondin-1 and the hep I peptide in fibroblasts requires the expression of Thy-1, although it does not appear to function as a stable member of the hep I receptor complex. Consistent with a known function of Thy-1 in regulating lipid raft-associated signaling, intact lipid rafts are necessary for hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly. Furthermore, we establish Src family kinase (SFK) activation as a novel component required for hep I-induced signaling leading to focal adhesion disassembly. hep I induces transient phosphorylation of SFKs in Thy-1-expressing fibroblasts only. Therefore, we conclude that Thy-1 surface expression is required for thrombospondin-1-induced focal adhesion disassembly in fibroblasts through an SFK-dependent mechanism.

Thy-1 is enriched in lipid raft microdomains, within which activation of multiple signaling cascades occurs (24Drevot P. Langlet C. Guo X.J. Bernard A.M. Colard O. Chauvin J. Lasserre R. He H.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The location of Thy-1 in lipid rafts affects its signaling functions (25Tiveron M.C. Nosten-Bertrand M. Jani H. Garnett D. Hirst E. Grosveld F. Morris R.J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1783-1796PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these known properties and our own observation that Thy-1 affects Src-mediated Rho GTPase activation (and subsequent fibroblast focal adhesion, cytoskeletal redistribution, and migration) (26Barker T.H. Grenett H.E. MacEwen M.W. Tilden S.G. Fuller G. Settleman J. Woods A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Hagood J.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 285: 488-496Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Thy-1 expression regulates focal adhesion dynamics in fibroblasts, including disassembly of focal adhesions by thombospondin-1. In this report, we describe clearly discordant responses of Thy-1 fibroblast subpopulations to TSP-1-mediated focal adhesion disassembly, identify that both lipid raft integrity and Src family kinase (SFK) activation are critical to the TSP-1-mediated focal adhesion disassembly signaling cascade, and demonstrate that Thy-1 surface expression is required for SFK activation by TSP-1 and subsequent focal adhesion disassembly in fibroblasts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—hep I peptide (ELTGAARKGSGRRLVKGPD) and modified hep I peptide (ELTGAARAGSGRRLVAGPDC) were synthesized, purified, and analyzed by Anaspec, Inc. (San Jose, CA) (24Drevot P. Langlet C. Guo X.J. Bernard A.M. Colard O. Chauvin J. Lasserre R. He H.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1899-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thrombospondin-1 was purified from human platelets as described by Murphy-Ullrich et al. (27Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Gurusiddappa S. Frazier W.A. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26784-26789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wortmannin, LY294002, grade 1 glutaraldehyde, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD), and cholesterol were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against low density LRP were kindly provided by Dr. Dudley Strickland (Department of Vascular Biology, Holland Laboratory, American Red Cross, Rockville, MD). Antibodies against phosphorylated Src (Y416) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). FITC-labeled antibodies against murine Thy-1.1 and Thy-1.2 and horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from BD Biosciences, and the Src2 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Alexafluor 566- and Texas Red X-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fetal bovine serum (FBS), HEPES buffer, minimal essential medium (MEM), trypsin, and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Mediatech, Inc. (Herndon, VA). Murine Thy-1.2 cDNA in a pBluescript SK+ plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Hiromitsu Nakauchi (The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, Tsukuba, Japan). The mammalian expression system pcDNA3.1 Zeo+ and Zeocin were purchased from Invitrogen. LT-1 transfection reagent was purchased from Mirus Corp. (Madison, WI). Anti-calreticulin (CRT) antiserum was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (Golden, CO).Primary Fibroblast Purification—Lung fibroblasts from Lewis rats were isolated and cultured as described previously (13McIntosh J.C. Hagood J.S. Richardson T.L. Simecka J.W. Eur. Respir. J. 1994; 7: 2131-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Primary fibroblasts were cultured in MEM with 10% FBS, 2.5 mm HEPES, 1% penicillin/streptomycin.Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting—Primary fibroblasts were trypsinized, placed in sterile polystyrene tubes (106 cells/tube, minimum 5 tubes), and washed with sterile PBS with 1% FBS. Each tube was then incubated with 20 μl of FITC-labeled anti-Thy-1.1 antibody (20 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 60 min. The cell suspension was then washed in PBS, 1% FBS and sorted in a BD Biosciences FACSTARPlus cell sorter under sterile conditions. Cells positive and negative for Thy-1 expression were subcultured and re-sorted once or twice additionally until subpopulations of >90% purity were obtained. Flow cytometry was also used to analyze cell-surface CRT expression.Thy-1 Expression Vector Creation and Transfection—A 480-bp murine Thy-1.2 cDNA containing the full-length coding sequence was isolated from a pBluescript SK+ plasmid by digestion with EcoRI and XhoI, purified by gel electrophoresis, and ligated into the mammalian expression system pcDNA3.1 Zeo+ at the EcoRI and XhoI sites using standard techniques. The construct was sequenced for verification and orientation. Embryonic rat lung fibroblasts (RFL6), cultured in growth medium (F12K with 20% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin), were transfected with both the empty pcDNA3.1 Zeo(+) expression vector (RFL6.EV) as well as the expression vector containing the murine Thy-1 cDNA (RFL6.Thy-1) using the transfection reagent LT-1 (Mirus, Madison, WI), and stable clones were selected by culture in the presence of 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Flow cytometry analysis was performed to verify populations of ≥90% Thy-1-positive fibroblasts and populations expressing Thy-1 at levels similar to those of wild-type Thy-1(+) fibroblasts for experimentation.Focal Adhesion Assay—Focal adhesion assays were performed as described previously (28Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Hook M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, fibroblasts were grown on glass coverslips in full growth medium (as described above) to ∼70% confluency, at which point the cells were rinsed with warm serum-free medium to remove the serum components and incubated in serum-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C to allow recovery from shear stress-related responses. In some experiments, inhibitors were added to the cells at this time. The cells were then treated with 1 μm hep I (the active focal adhesion disassembly sequence of TSP-1), human platelet TSP-1 (250 nm), modified hep I (1 μm), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB (545 nm) for 30 min. The coverslips were fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde and examined by interference reflection microscopy (IRM) using a modified inverted Zeiss microscope. Analysis was performed by a single experienced investigator blinded to cell type and condition, and the cells were issued a positive score based on the presence of at least three focal adhesion structures/cell. A minimum number of 300 cells/coverslip was scored.Biotin-tagged hep I Peptide Pull-down—Thy-1(+) fibroblasts were incubated with biotin-tagged hep I peptide for 5 min and washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the cells were then harvested by scraping. Membrane proteins were solubilized with 50 mm Brij98. Equal amounts of protein (1 mg) from each cell type were analyzed. Proteins associated with biotin-tagged hep I were co-precipitated by incubation overnight at 4 °C with a 100-μl slurry of neutravidin beads (Pierce). The samples were washed seven times in DTO buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.5% Tween 20, and 0.1% ovalbumin). Bound proteins were solubilized in Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on 6% gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose, Thy-1 co-precipitation with the biotin peptide complexes was detected by immunoblotting with anti-Thy-1 antibody. The blots were stripped and checked for CRT presence using anti-CRT antiserum.Immunoblotting—For cell signaling immunoblots, cells were plated and grown to 70% confluence in full growth medium, at which point the cells were rendered quiescent in medium containing 0.1% FBS for a minimum of 24 h. Following the quiescence period, the cells were stimulated with hep I peptide (5 μm) for 0, 2, 5, 10, and 15 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cells were then washed briefly with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.2, and lysed using standard 2× SDS sample buffer or modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm NaVO4, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Immunoblots for LRP expression were generated from unstimulated fibroblasts in logarithmic growth. All lysates were sonicated for 10 s and immediately boiled for 5 min and then stored at -20 °C until used. The lysates were electrophoresed in 10% (for SFK signaling) or 5% (for LRP expression) SDS-polyacrylamide gels as indicated, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF-Plus, Osmonics, Washington, MA), and probed as described in Ref. 26Barker T.H. Grenett H.E. MacEwen M.W. Tilden S.G. Fuller G. Settleman J. Woods A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Hagood J.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 285: 488-496Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar. To account for gel-loading errors in signaling experiments, as well as variations in cell density, the membranes were stripped and re-blotted for total Src family kinases using the broad Src family antibody Src2 (Santa Cruz).Immunofluorescence—Subconfluent monolayers of Thy-1(+) fibroblasts were cultured on glass coverslips and then rendered quiescent. Fibroblasts were stimulated with hep I peptide (5 μm) for 5 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Coverslips were then washed briefly with ice-cold PBS, blocked with 10% normal goat serum/PBS, incubated with anti-Thy-1.1·FITC for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of 0.1 mm NaVO4, and then fixed in methanol at -20 °C and incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-human phospho-Src (Y416) for 16 h at 4 °C followed by Texas Red X-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 40 min at room temperature. The controls for antibody specificity were mouse IgG1κ·FITC (BD Biosciences) and rabbit IgG. Coverslips were mounted on glass microscope slides and examined with a Leitz Axioplan epifluorescence microscope. Images were acquired with a SenSys-cooled charge-coupled device, high resolution, monochromatic digital camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) and analyzed with IPLab Spectrum software (Signal Analytics Corp., Fairfax, VA).Statistical Analysis—Comparisons involving three or more groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA (Student-Newman-Keuls method for multiple comparisons). Student's t test was employed when determining the significance of single treatments compared with untreated samples. In both cases a p value ≤ 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.RESULTShep I Mediates Focal Adhesion Disassembly Only in Thy-1(+) Primary Fibroblasts—Focal adhesion disassembly in response to TSP-1 or the hep I peptide was analyzed in Thy-1(-)- and Thy-1(+)-sorted primary Lewis rat lung fibroblasts using IRM. Thy-1(+) fibroblasts actively underwent focal adhesion disassembly in response to a 30-min stimulation with hep I (1 μm; Fig. 1) or TSP-1 (250 nm), whereas Thy-1(-) fibroblasts failed to respond. The specificity of the hep I/TSP-1 response was verified by determining the focal adhesion disassembly following treatment with a control-modified hep I peptide (1 μm) and PDGF-BB (545 nm), a potent stimulator of focal adhesion disassembly in fibroblasts (29Greenwood J.A. Theibert A.B. Prestwich G.D. Murphy-Ullrich J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 627-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Consistent with qualitative findings, the quantitative analysis indicates that TSP-1 and its active peptide, hep I, mediate focal adhesion disassembly in Thy-1(+) (but not Thy-1(-)) fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). Statistical comparison by one-way ANOVA (power = 1.00, α = 0.05) demonstrates that modified hep I does not elicit focal adhesion disassembly responses in either fibroblast subpopulation, whereas PDGF-BB induced focal adhesion disassembly in both Thy-1(+) and Thy-1(-) fibroblasts, indicating that the Thy-1-dependent response is specific to the TSP-1/hep I-mediated signaling pathway (Figs. 1 and 2A). As reported previously (5Greenwood J.A. Pallero M.A. Theibert A.B. Murphy-Ullrich J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1755-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) for bovine aortic endothelial cells, the hep I-mediated response in Thy-1(+) fibroblasts was sensitive to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, indicating a critical role for this signaling pathway in the observed response (Fig. 2B). In endothelial cells, the receptor complex mediating focal adhesion disassembly in response to hep I is known to include cell-surface CRT and LRP. Both Thy-1(-) and Thy-1(+) fibroblast subpopulations were shown to express both CRT and LRP (Fig. 3).Fig. 2The differential focal adhesion disassembly response of Thy-1 fibroblast subpopulations is specific to TSP-1/hep I and dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling. A, sorted Thy-1 fibroblasts were grown on coverslips as described in the legend to Fig. 1 and incubated with hep I (1 μm), TSP-1 (250 nm), modified hep I (1 μm), PDGF-BB (545 nm), or MEM only for 30 min. B, Thy-1(+) fibroblasts were grown on coverslips as described above and preincubated with MEM, LY294002 (10 μm), or Wortmannin (2.5 nm) for 15 min followed by stimulation with hep I (1 μm) or MEM for 30 min. The coverslips were examined by IRM and assayed for the percentage of cells positive for focal adhesions ± S.D., n ≥ 3. A minimum of 300 cells/condition was evaluated. One-way ANOVA demonstrates that only Thy-1(+) fibroblasts treated with hep I, TSP-1, and PDGF-BB and Thy-1(-) fibroblasts treated with PDGF-BB were significantly different from the base-line controls. Student's t test demonstrates that both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors are sufficient to block hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly. In both statistical analyses, *** denotes p ≤ 0.001 versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Thy-1(+) and Thy-1(-) fibroblasts express both known hep I receptor components. A, Thy-1(+) and Thy-1(-) fibroblasts were plated on standard tissue culture-treated plastic in MEM with 10% FBS and grown to ∼80% confluence. The cells were lysed in 2× reducing Laemmli sample buffer, immediately boiled and separated by gel electrophoresis (5% acrylamide), and transferred for Western blotting. Rabbit anti-LRP was used to detect LRP expression in both subpopulations. B, Thy-1(+) and Thy-1(-) fibroblasts were plated on tissue culture-treated plastic to 80% confluence and removed by EDTA. Cell suspensions were stained for cell-surface CRT by indirect immunofluorescence and analyzed by flow cytometry (lower histograms), compared with secondary antibody-only controls (upper left). To control for the staining of intracellular CRT due to membrane permeability, the samples were analyzed for the intracellular Src family kinase member fyn (upper right). Flow histograms show no significant difference in the expression of cell-surface CRT in either subpopulation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Src Family Kinases Are Activated by hep I and Are Required for Focal Adhesion Disassembly Mediated by Both hep I and PDGF-BB—Src family kinases have been shown to be activated following Thy-1 cross-linking in lymphocytes and are essential in Thy-1-dependent T-cell activation following Fc receptor engagement (22Haeryfar S.M. Hoskin D.W. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Draberova L. Draber P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; : 3611-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Src family kinases have both signaling and structural roles in the maintenance and turnover of focal adhesions (31Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 32Frame M.C. Fincham V.J. Carragher N.O. Wyke J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We identified a requirement for Src family kinase downstream signaling in Thy-1-dependent hep I-mediated fibroblast focal adhesion disassembly by the addition of the Src-specific inhibitor PP2 (10 nm, Fig 4A). The addition of PP2, which binds the kinase domain of all Src family members prior to hep I stimulation, was sufficient to inhibit hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly in Thy-1(+) fibroblasts. Furthermore, PP2 treatment was also sufficient to block PDGF-BB (which is a potent stimulator of Src in both subpopulations)-stimulated (26Barker T.H. Grenett H.E. MacEwen M.W. Tilden S.G. Fuller G. Settleman J. Woods A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Hagood J.S. Exp.

Western blotting for active Src family kinases following hep I stimulation demonstrates that Src family kinases are transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine 416 following stimulation. Only Thy-1(+) fibroblasts demonstrate Src activation following hep I stimulation (Fig. 5B). Immunofluorescence confirms Src activation following hep I stimulation (Fig. 5A).Fig. 4hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly in Thy-1(+) fibroblasts requires Src family kinase activity. Thy-1(+) fibroblasts (>90% purity) were plated on coverslips in the presence of full growth medium, allowed to spread overnight, and then washed with warm MEM and incubated at 37 °C to recover from stress responses for 30 min. The broad Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2 (10 nm), was added at the time of the 30-min incubation to recover from shear stress. Following the recovery time, the cells were treated with hep I (1 μm), PDGF-BB (545 nm), or MEM alone for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were examined by IRM and assayed for the percentage of cells positive for focal adhesions ± S.D., n ≥ 3. A minimum of 300 cells/condition was evaluated.

The cells were then treated with hep I (1 μm) for 5 min and immediately fixed with 3% formaldehyde. The fixed cells were stained for Thy-1 and phospho-Src (pY416) and imaged on a Leitz inverted microscope with a 100× objective. B, Thy-1 fibroblast subpopulations were grown on tissue culture plastic in full growth medium. At 80% confluence, the cells were rendered quiescent for 48 h by serum starvation. The monolayers were immediately stimulated by the addition of hep I (1 μm) for 0, 2, 5, 10, and 15 min. Following stimulation, the cells were immediately lysed in buffer containing phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and analyzed by Western blotting for total Src family kinases and phosphorylated Src family kinases.

We tested whether lipid raft integrity is required for hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly in Thy-1(+) fibroblasts by lipid raft disruption with MBCD and lipid raft reconstitution by the addition of exogenous cholesterol. In a dose-dependent manner, MBCD was shown to inhibit hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, the addition of excessive cholesterol with MBCD rescued the hep I response in these cells (Fig. 6B).Fig. 6Lipid raft integrity is essential for hep I-mediated focal adhesion disassembly in Thy-1(+) fibroblasts. A, Thy-1(+) fibroblasts (>90% purity) were plated on coverslips in the presence of full growth medium and allowed to spread overnight and then washed with warm MEM and incubated at 37 °C to recover from stress responses for 30 min. The cells were incubated with MBCD at various concentrations (as noted under “Experimental Procedures”) for 15 min prior to hep I stimulation. Following the 30-min recovery period, the cells were treated with hep I (1 μm) or MEM alone for 30 min at 37 °C.

Diacylglycerol induces translocation of the vesicle priming factor Munc13 and association of the secretory vesicle protein DOC2B to the membrane. Here we demonstrate that a rise in intracellular Ca2+ is sufficient for a Munc13-independent recruitment of DOC2B to the target membrane. This novel mechanism occurred readily in the absence of Munc13 and was not influenced by DOC2B mutations that abolish Munc13 binding. Purified DOC2B (expressed as a bacterial fusion protein) bound phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent way, suggesting that the translocation is the result of a C2 domain activation mechanism. Ca2+-induced translocation was also observed in cultured neurons expressing DOC2B-enhanced green fluorescent protein. In this case, however, various degrees of membrane association occurred under resting conditions, suggesting that physiological Ca2+ concentrations modulate DOC2B localization. Depolarization of the neurons induced a complete translocation of DOC2B-enhanced green fluorescent protein to the target membrane within 5 s. We hypothesize that this novel Ca2+-induced activity of DOC2B functions synergistically with diacylglycerol-induced Munc13 binding to enhance exocytosis during episodes of high secretory activity.

We hypothesize that this novel Ca2+-induced activity of DOC2B functions synergistically with diacylglycerol-induced Munc13 binding to enhance exocytosis during episodes of high secretory activity. Ca2+-induced exocytosis is a widely conserved mechanism of importance for a broad range of secretory systems, such as the release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the central and peripheral nervous system. To attain fusion competence, secretory vesicles must first dock at the target membrane and undergo a process called priming. The release of fusion-ready vesicles is coupled to the opening of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane, producing a transient high Ca2+ concentration (10-100 μm for ∼1 ms) in close proximity to the channels. The inward Ca2+ current then diffuses into the cytoplasm, resulting in a residual concentration in the range of 1 μm during tens of seconds. It is widely accepted that this residual Ca2+ concentration induces short term changes in exocytotic strength (e.g. see Refs. 1Fisher S.A. Fischer T.M. Carew T.J. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 170-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar and 2Zucker R.S. Regehr W.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 355-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (3312) Google Scholar), although the mechanisms that contribute to this phenomenon remain largely unclear. As a result, the secretory strength of neuronal and endocrine release sites is modulated in an activity-dependent way. This phenomenon is important to avoid vesicle depletion during repetitive stimulation and is furthermore considered in neurons to contribute to memory and learning. Although Ca2+ is the most important messenger after high frequency activation of the release site, exocytotic potentiation can also be induced by diacylglycerol (synthesized by members of the phospholipase family) or by its phorbolester analogues. Diacylglycerol has multiple intracellular targets (e.g. protein kinase C isoforms), but the potentiating effect in regulated exocytosis is mediated by the priming factor Munc13-1. Munc13-1-deficient mice die shortly after birth and show a defect in synaptic vesicle exocytosis from glutamatergic synapses, presumably due to an arrest between the docking and fusion steps of the synaptic vesicle cycle (3Augustin I. Rosenmund C. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Nature. 1999; 400: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). In another study, the Munc13-1 gene was replaced with the allele Munc13-1H567K, encoding a mutant protein that specifically lacks diacylglycerol-binding activity. Hippocampal neurons from homozygous Munc13-1H567K mice show normal evoked postsynaptic currents (4Rhee J.S. Betz A. Pyott S. Reim K. Varoqueaux F. Augustin I. Hesse D. Sudhof T.C. Takahashi M. Rosenmund C. Brose N. Cell. 2002; 108: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, the readily releasable pool size is diminished, the recovery from high frequency stimulation is slowed down, and the potentiating effect of phorbolesters is blocked (4Rhee J.S. Betz A. Pyott S. Reim K. Varoqueaux F. Augustin I. Hesse D. Sudhof T.C. Takahashi M. Rosenmund C. Brose N. Cell. 2002; 108: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Thus, Munc13-1 may enhance vesicle priming during high frequency stimulation through acting as a diacylglycerol sensor. Several studies have suggested that the potentiating activity of Munc13 involves its interaction with proteins of the DOC2 family, as discussed below. The DOC2 protein family comprises three isoforms, designated DOC2A, -B, and -C. The latter is predominantly expressed in the heart (5Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). DOC2A and DOC2B are both expressed in the brain, and in addition DOC2B is found in several peripheral tissues (6Sakaguchi G. Orita S. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Verhage M. de Vries K.J. Roshol H. Burbach J.P. Gispen W.H. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 453-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In subcellular fractionations, DOC2A and -B copurify with secretory vesicles, although they lack a transmembrane domain. DOC2 proteins consist of three structural domains: a short N-terminal domain and two C2 domains named C2A and C2B, respectively, similar to those in synaptotagmins and protein kinase C (PKC). 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MAP2, microtubule-associated protein 2. This presence of these motifs predicts a Ca2+-binding function. For DOC2B, this was experimentally confirmed in vitro; Ca2+ induced binding of the isolated C2A domain to phosphatidylserine-containing liposomes with half-maximal binding at 1 μm Ca2+ (8Kojima T. Fukuda M. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A positive function in secretion was suggested by the increased release of growth hormone from PC12 cells overexpressing DOC2A (9Orita S. Sasaki T. Komuro R. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7257-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both DOC2A and -B bind Munc13-1 in a diacylglycerol-dependent manner (10Orita S. Naito A. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16081-16084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This interaction is mediated by the Munc13-interacting domain located within the N-terminal domain of DOC2. Interestingly, diacylglycerol also induces a Munc13-1-dependent translocation of DOC2B to the plasma membrane in HEK293 cells (11Duncan R.R. Betz A. Shipston M.J. Brose N. Chow R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27347-27350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Injection of a synthetic peptide identical to the Munc13-interacting domain region into cholinergic neurons of the superior cervical ganglion was shown to inhibit synaptic transmission in an activity-dependent manner (12Mochida S. Orita S. Sakaguchi G. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11418-11422Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similarly, injection of this peptide into the Calyx of Held blocked the potentiating effect of phorbolester administered 5 min after the peptide (13Hori T. Takai Y. Takahashi T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7262-7267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that the DOC2-Munc13 interaction contributes to the mechanism of diacylglycerol-induced presynaptic potentiation. DOC2 proteins also bind to Munc18, a syntaxin-binding protein that is required for neurotransmitter secretion (7Verhage M. de Vries K.J. Roshol H. Burbach J.P. Gispen W.H. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 453-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 14Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). In chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland, homozygous Munc18 null mice showed a 10-fold reduction in morphologically docked vesicles and a corresponding reduction in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of large dense core vesicles (15Voets T. Toonen R.F. Brian E.C. de Wit H. Moser T. Rettig J. Sudhof T.C. Neher E. Verhage M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Many overexpression studies with Munc18 homologs have been reported with seemingly conflicting results, in general supporting the hypothesis that Munc18 exerts its function in the final stages upstream from Ca2+-induced vesicle exocytosis at least in mammalian systems (16Toonen R.F. Verhage M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Here we describe a novel mechanism for the translocation of DOC2B to the membrane, triggered by intracellular Ca2+. In contrast to the diacylglycerol-induced translocation, Ca2+-dependent translocation occurs independent of Munc13 binding. Since diacylglycerol and Ca2+ activation generally coincide during episodes of high secretory activity, we hypothesize that both mechanisms may act in concert to increase the exocytotic strength. Antibodies—A polyclonal antibody designated 13.2 was raised against DOC2B by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with 500 μg of a bacterially expressed polypeptide comprising amino acids 22-116 of DOC2B. The serum recognized a single protein of the expected molecular mass as determined by Western blotting using rat brain homogenate. It also reacted strongly with lysate from HEK293 cells expressing fusion proteins consisting of DOC2B and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) but not EGFP alone. The mouse monoclonal anti-Myc tag antibody 9E10 and the mouse monoclonal anti-EGFP antibody B34 were purchased from Babco (Richmond, CA). Construction of Expression Vectors—A cDNA fragment encoding full-length wild type DOC2B (GenBank™ accession number U70778) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the DNA polymerase PfuI (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the rat cDNA clone pNP3a as template (7Verhage M. de Vries K.J. Roshol H. Burbach J.P. Gispen W.H. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 453-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The sense primer (5′-ttggtacccgctgacttaccccc-3′) introduces a KpnI restriction site 69 nucleotides upstream of the start codon; the anti-sense primer (5′-gcggatcccgtcgtcgagtacagc-3′) removes the stop codon and introduces a BamHI restriction site. This fragment was introduced into pEGFP-N2 (Clontech) using the corresponding sites. Expression vectors encoding Myc-tagged DOC2B were derived from this vector by subcloning the NheI-BamHI fragment into the corresponding sites of pCDNA3.1-Myc-HisC (Invitrogen). Expression vectors encoding Munc13-1, PKC-α, and PKC-γ were described previously (17Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

Site-directed Mutagenesis—Complementary DNAs encoding the mutant fusion proteins listed in Table I were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, performed by full-length amplification of the pEGFP-N2-DOC2B expression vector with mutagenic primers. PfuI DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) was used for amplification. Template DNA was selectively degraded by incubation with DpnI endonuclease, and the PCR product was introduced into Escherichia coli DH5α. The integrity of all mutant cDNAs was confirmed by sequence analysis of the complete open reading frame on a Beckman CEQ 2000 automated sequencer (Fullerton, CA). All DOC2B variants (wild type and mutant) were also subcloned into pCDNA3.1 and pCDNA3.1-Myc (Invitrogen).Table INames of mutant DOC2B molecules generated by site-directed mutagenesisNameMutationEffectTCTΔ2-9Blocks Tctex-1 bindingM13Substitution of amino acids 15-20 (QEHMAI to YKDWAF)Blocks Munc13 binding Open table in a new tab Cell Culture—HEK293 (ATCC CRL 1573) were cultured at 37 °C in the presence of 5% (v/v) CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing sodium pyruvate, pyridoxine, and 1 g/liter glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 1 mm glutamine, 1× nonessential amino acids (Gibco), 200 IU/ml penicillin, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin. One day after seeding on glass coverslips in 6-well plates, the cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of vector DNA using the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. For co-expression of Munc13-1, the expression vector pCDNA3-Munc13-1 was added in a 3-fold molar excess over pEGFPDOC2B. Medium was refreshed at 16 and 40 h, and translocation assays were performed at 48-50 h post-transfection. PC12 cells were cultured on 18-mm glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in the presence of 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of vector DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), and measurements (by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy) were conducted 6-8 h post-transfection. Neurons were isolated from C57BL/6 mouse embryos at day 18 of gestation and seeded at 25,000 cells/cm2 in 12-well plates on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B-27 supplement (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified chamber gassed with 5% CO2. Six h after seeding, the neurons were transduced with lentiviral particles using a multiplicity of infection of 1.5-2 infective particles/cell. Western Blotting—Fourty-eight h post-transfection, HEK293 cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 16,000 × g, followed by electrophoresis on a 6-15% Tris-glycine gradient gel. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (BioRad). Membranes were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C in 5% blocking agent (Amersham Biosciences) dissolved in TBST (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), washed, and incubated with anti-GFP (Covance Research Products, Denver, PA; diluted 1:25,000) or anti-Doc2B (13.2; diluted 1:1,000) for 90 min in TBST. The membranes where washed again and incubated for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:5,000 in TBST. Finally, the membranes were washed, incubated for 5 min in enhanced chemifluorescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences), and analyzed on a FLA5000 fluoroimager (Raytest, Tilburg, The Netherlands). All incubations were carried out at room temperature unless otherwise stated. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed 48 h post-transfection for 15 min in 2% paraformaldehyde (Merck) in PBS and 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. Subsequently, they were incubated in PBS containing 4% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) for 20 min. Next, the cells were incubated with anti-Doc2B antibody 13.2, diluted 1:4,000 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. As the secondary antibody we used Alexa546-conjugated goat anti rabbit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) diluted 1:1,000 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were mounted in Dabco-Mowiol (Sigma) and analyzed on an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss BV, Weesp, The Netherlands). Confocal Imaging of Live and Fixed Cells—For imaging of EGFP fluorescence in fixed cells, the cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in basal buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.4 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm glucose), in ionophore-containing medium (basal buffer supplemented with 3 mm CaCl2 and 1 μm A23187) or in a depolarizing medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 90 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 1.4 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm glucose. A23187 was purchased from Sigma. In case cells were fixed, this was achieved by adding an equal volume of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde to the medium and incubating for 20 min at room temperature. Neurons were then counterstained for microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2; a neuron-specific protein located in dendrites) as follows. After fixation, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated for 1 h with a monoclonal antibody recognizing MAP2 (Chemicon; diluted 1:200 in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100), washed again twice, and incubated in the presence of Alexa546-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes; diluted 1:000). Confocal imaging was performed with an LSM 510 confocal microscope and a ×63 Plan-Neofluar lens (Carl Zeiss). Fluorescence intensity in regions of interest was quantitated using Multianalyst image analysis software (Bio-Rad). To test statistically if the fluorescence intensity after stimulation was significantly different from that before stimulation, the fluorescence after stimulation was calculated as a percentage of the original value. This was done for each cellular compartment in nine different cells. A two-tailed Student's t test was used to test whether the resulting mean values differed significantly from 100% (p < 0.005). Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy—Transfected PC12 cells were incubated in basal solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.35, 147 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm glucose. Depolarizing solution (identical except for NaCl (90 mm) and KCl (60 mm)) was applied using a motor-driven two barrel Piezo perfusion device (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT), allowing for fast (<10-ms) switching between depolarizing and basal solution. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy was performed on a Zeiss inverted microscope with custom built TIRF set up (Till Photonics, Grafelfing, Germany), using a ×100 objective with 1.45 numerical aperture. The depth of the evanescent field was measured to be 128 nm. Images were collected at 30 Hz using an intensified CCD camera (I-Pentamax; Roper Scientific) and analyzed with Metamorph (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Fluorescence intensity was measured in a region of interest over the cell and corrected for background measured outside of the cell. Expression and Purification of GST-DOC2B—Full-length rat DOC2B cDNA was cloned into the expression vector pGEX4T3 (Amersham Biosciences) to encode a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and DOC2B. To isolate GST-DOC2B, 5 liters of Luria broth medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.2% glucose was incubated at 37 °C until the exponential growth phase was reached. The incubation was then prolonged for 4 h in the presence of 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to induce expression. Bacteria were centrifuged for 15 min at 4,000 × g and resuspended in 100 ml of HBS buffer (140 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Applied Science catalog no. 1836170). The cells were lysed by sonication and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of 2.5% Triton X-100 for solubilization. After clearing the lysate by centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g and 4 °C, GST-DOC2B was affinity-purified using glutathione-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma). The amount of bound protein was determined by eluting GST-DOC2B in HBS plus 10 mm glutathione from a sample of the beads, followed by a Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The final yield of recombinant protein was 1.2 mg/liter of culture volume. Liposome Binding Assay—3H-Labeled liposomes were prepared by drying a mixture of 125 μl of phosphatidylcholine, 50 μl of phosphatidylserine (both 10 mg/ml in chloroform; Sigma), and 20 μl of 1,2-dipalmitoyl, l-3-phosphatidyl [N-methyl-3H]choline (1 mCi/ml; specific activity 83 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) under a nitrogen gas flow. The phospholipids were suspended in 10 ml of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 100 mm NaCl, sonicated for 30 s, and centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 × g to remove aggregates from the liposome suspension. Buffered Ca2+ solutions were prepared in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.20, 140 mm NaCl, and 10 mm EGTA (<1 μm free Ca2+) or HEDTA (>1 μm free Ca2+) as a chelator. The concentrations of total Ca2+ were calculated with Win-Maxc version 2.40 (Chris Patton, Stanford, CA; available on the World Wide Web at www.standford.edu/~cpatton). Liposome binding was assayed in each buffer by incubating 50 μl of a 25% Sepharose slurry containing 50 μg of immobilized GST-DOC2B with 100 μl of the 3H-labeled liposome suspension for 1 h at 20 °C in a total volume of 1.5 ml. The beads were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 × g and washed with 1.5 ml of the same buffered Ca2+ solution. After five washes, bound 3H-labeled phospholipids were eluted from the beads in 0.5% SDS, and radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting in UltimaGold mixture (Packard). To investigate the possibility that DOC2B may function as a Ca2+ sensor in the activity-dependent enhancement of exocytosis, we first used heterologous cell lines to analyze whether Ca2+ influences the cellular distribution of DOC2B. To focus exclusively on Ca2+-dependent mechanisms, we selected HEK293 cells that lack endogenous expression of Munc13, thus excluding the diacylglycerol-induced DOC2B translocation for which Munc13 is required (11Duncan R.R. Betz A. Shipston M.J. Brose N. Chow R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27347-27350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins consisting of full-length DOC2B and EGFP were expressed in HEK293 cells as stable proteins with the expected molecular mass (Fig. 1). The full-length band was also recognized by a polyclonal antibody against DOC2B, whereas this antibody did not recognize EGFP alone (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether the EGFP tag could cause mislocalization of the expressed protein, we compared the cellular distribution of DOC2B-EGFP with that of untagged DOC2B. As shown in Fig. 1, C and F, both proteins produced a similar staining pattern using anti-DOC2B antibody. The immunostaining pattern was also similar to the fluorescence derived directly from the EGFP tag, except that the nuclear staining was relatively weak (Fig. 1, C-E). The antigenic region could be less accessible in nuclear-resident DOC2B-EGFP. As an additional control we replaced EGFP with a Myc tag, resulting in the same distribution under all conditions tested (data not shown). The distribution of DOC2BMyc was again similar to that of the untagged DOC2B variants. From these control experiments, we conclude that the EGFP tag does not cause instability or artifacts in the subcellular localization of DOC2B. Ca2+-dependent Localization of DOC2B-EGFP in Heterologous Cells—Under standard culture conditions, DOC2B-EGFP and DOC2B were homogenously distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected HEK293 cells. The fluorescence intensity in the nucleus varied between cells. The same homogenous distribution was observed when the cells were incubated in basal buffer lacking Ca2+. In contrast, when the cells were incubated under conditions that elevate intracellular Ca2+ levels, DOC2B-EGFP showed a clearly distinct distribution characterized by an intense membrane-associated fluorescence and a loss of cytoplasmic fluorescence. This is shown in Fig. 2, where Ca2+ influx was induced by the extracellular application of 3 mm Ca2+ and a 1 μm concentration of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Following this treatment, a redistribution of the fusion protein was evident within less than 10 s. After stimulation, the membrane-associated fluorescence was not completely uniform along the cell membrane but showed focal accumulations (Fig. 2, arrowheads). The overall fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm, membrane, and nucleus was quantitated at different time points in nine different cells. Cytoplasmic fluorescence decreased significantly (p < 0.005) to 44 ± 3% of the original value (mean ± S.E., n = 9), whereas the membrane-associated fluorescence increased significantly (p < 0.005) to 131 ± 6%. The nuclear fluorescence intensity remained constant (mean value 101 ± 1%). We therefore conclude that DOC2B-EGFP migrates from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane after Ca2+ influx. To exclude a nonspecific activity of the ionophore A23187 or its solvent, the ionophore was administered in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. This treatment did not induce any change in fluorescence distribution (Fig. 3, C and G). When 3 mm extracellular Ca2+ was applied without the ionophore, there was a small but detectable increase in plasma membrane-associated fluorescence (Fig. 3, B and F). This subtle change may reflect a small increase in intracellular Ca2+ as a consequence of the extracellular rise in Ca2+ concentration. Only after application of both components at the same time did a quantitative translocation of the fluorescent protein occur (Fig. 3, D and H). We also investigated whether the translocation was reversible and repeatable (Fig. 3, I-P). Cells expressing DOC2B-EGFP were stimulated as described above. The medium was then replaced to wash out the ionophore, resulting in a reversal of the membrane-associated fluorescence to a homogenous cytoplasmic distribution. An additional replacement with stimulation medium again induced a translocation of DOC2B-EGFP to the plasma membrane. These control experiments indicate that the observed translocation of DOC2BEGFP requires Ca2+ influx and is not caused by irreversible cell damage due to the stimulation treatment. The Ca2+-induced Translocation of DOC2B Is Independent of Munc13 and Tctex-1 Binding—The binding of DOC2B to the plasma membrane could be mediated by accessory proteins or by direct binding of one of the C2 domains to the phospholipid bilayer. To investigate the participation of each functional domain, we introduced targeted mutations in the N-terminal domain to block the interaction with Munc13 and Tctex-1 (a subunit of the cytoplasmic dynein complex), respectively (Fig. 4) (see Table I). All mutants expressed showed the expected molecular mass without visible signs of degradation in Western blotting (Fig. 1). Although HEK293 cells do not express Munc13 to detectable amounts as analyzed by immunoblotting, the above experiments do not exclude the involvement of extremely low amounts of Munc13. Therefore, we introduced a previously characterized mutation in the Munc13-interacting domain of DOC2B that abolishes Munc13 binding (12Mochida S. Orita S. Sakaguchi G. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11418-11422Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (see Table I). To confirm that this mutation blocks the Munc13-dependent translocation triggered by phorbolesters, we first co-expressed DOC2B-EGFP and Munc13-1 in HEK293 cells. In agreement with previously reported studies (11Duncan R.R. Betz A. Shipston M.J. Brose N. Chow R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27347-27350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the administration of the phorbolester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate resulted in a translocation of DOC2B-EGFP (Fig. 5A). When the same treatment was performed with the mutated DOC2B-EGFP variant (M13), no translocation was observed (Fig. 5B). However, when the same cells were stimulated with 3 mm Ca2+ and 1 μm ionophore, the mutated protein readily translocated to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5C). Having confirmed that the M13 mutation effectively blocks the phorbolester-induced translocation of DOC2B-EGFP, we next expressed mutated DOC2BEGFP without co-expression of Munc13 (Fig. 6). Upon induction of Ca2+ influx, the mutant fusion protein rapidly associated with the plasma membrane in a way that was indistinguishable from wild type DOC2B-"

However, effects on cardiac function caused by inhibition of their activity in the heart have yet to be evaluated. Cardiac-specific inhibition of Rho family protein activities was achieved by expressing Rho GDIalpha, an endogenous specific GDP dissociation inhibitor for Rho family proteins, using the alpha-myosin heavy-chain promoter. Increased expression of Rho GDIalpha led to atrial arrhythmias and mild ventricular hypertrophy in adult mice (4-7 months). However, left ventricular systolic and diastolic function was largely preserved before and after the development of cardiac hypertrophy, indicating that Rho GTPases are not required to maintain ventricular contractile function under basal physiological condition. Electrocardiography and intracardiac electrophysiological studies revealed first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block in the transgenic heart at 1 week of age, which further progressed into second-degree AV block at 4 weeks of age before the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Expression of connexin 40 dramatically decreased from 1 week to 4 weeks of age in the transgenic heart, which may contribute in part to the conduction defects in the transgenic mice. This study provides novel evidence for an important role of Rho GTPases in regulating AV conduction."
https://openalex.org/W2132830613,"ERK7 is a unique member of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subfamily of MAP kinases. Although ERK7 shares a TEY motif in the activation loop of the kinase, it displays constitutive activation, nuclear localization, and growth inhibitory properties that are regulated by its C-terminal domain. Because ERK7 is expressed at low levels compared with ERK2 and its activity is dependent upon its expression level, we investigated the mechanism by which ERK7 expression is regulated. We now show that ERK7 expression is regulated by ubiquitination and rapid proteosomal turnover. Furthermore, both the kinase domain and the C-terminal tail are independently degraded at a rate comparable with that of the intact protein. Analysis of a series of chimeras between ERK2 and ERK7 reveal that the N-terminal 20 amino acids of the kinase domain are a primary determinant of ERK7 degradation. Fusion of the N-terminal 20 amino acids is both necessary and sufficient to cause proteolytic degradation of both ERK2 and green fluorescent protein. Finally, ERK7 is stabilized by an N-terminal mutant of Cullin-1 suggesting that ERK7 is ubiquitinated by the Skip1-Cullin-F box complex. These results indicate that ERK7 is a highly regulated enzyme whose cellular expression and kinase activation level is tightly controlled by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway.

Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3479) Google Scholar). These kinases, which consist of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the Jun kinases (JNKs), and the p38 kinases, are classically activated via dual phosphorylation by a MAP kinase kinase. MAP kinase kinases, which phosphorylate an activation loop on MAP kinase consisting of a TXY motif, are in turn phosphorylated by MAP kinase kinase kinases that respond to extracellular stimuli. Although this paradigm applies to the general MAP kinase family, recent evidence suggests that activation of more distant members of this family may be regulated by other mechanisms.The ERK family of MAP kinases can be divided into at least two classes: 1) the classic MAP kinases that consist primarily of a kinase domain such as ERK1 and ERK2; and 2) the big MAP kinases such as ERK3, ERK5, ERK7, and ERK8 that consist of both a kinase domain and a C-terminal domain and range in size from 60 to over 100 kDa. In contrast to ERK1 and ERK2 that require discrete scaffolding proteins such as KSR for maximal activation, the big MAP kinases have C-terminal regions that can function as protein interaction domains that regulate kinase localization (2Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), activation (3Abe M.K. Kahle K.T. Saelzler M.P. Orth K. Dixon J.E. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21272-21279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and transcriptional activity (4Kasler H.G. Victoria J. Duramad O. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8382-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of ERK7 has been shown previously to be required for ERK7 constitutive activation and nuclear localization as well as growth inhibition by ERK7 (2Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Abe M.K. Kahle K.T. Saelzler M.P. Orth K. Dixon J.E. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21272-21279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, a role for the C-terminal domain in regulating protein expression has not previously been described.From an evolutionary perspective, ERK7 is a unique member of the MAP kinase family. Unlike ERKs, JNKs, and p38s that share over 90% homology between human and rodents, ERK7, which was originally cloned in rat, shares less than 70% homology with its closest human counterpart identified in the human genome, ERK8. Furthermore, ERK8 differs in its mechanism of activation, localization, and substrate specificity (5Abe M.K. Saelzler M.P. Espinosa III, R. Kahle K.T. Hershenson M.B. Le Beau M.M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16733-16743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, although ERK8 may be considered the human orthologue of ERK7, its evolutionary divergence that derives in large part from the C-terminal domain raises the possibility that the two enzymes may have unique as well as overlapping functions. The physiological roles of ERK7 and ERK8 are currently under investigation. Initial studies revealed that overexpression of ERK7 can lead to suppression of DNA synthesis that was dependent on the presence of the C-terminal domain of ERK7 but independent of its kinase activity (2Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A recent study suggested that exogenously expressed rat ERK7 can regulate the proteolytic turnover of the estrogen receptor in human cells (6Henrich L.M. Smith J.A. Kitt D. Errington T.M. Nguyen B. Traish A.M. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5979-5988Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, in light of the significant sequence and functional differences between ERK7 and ERK8, the physiological relevance of these observations requires further investigation.One of the striking features of ERK7 and ERK8 are the extremely low levels of endogenous protein expression in cultured cells and tissues. The present study was undertaken to determine the mechanism by which ERK7 is regulated. Whereas no significant difference in transcript levels were detected, our results indicated that the ERK7 protein is rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteosome, and this process is regulated in part by the N terminus of the kinase domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—A rabbit polyclonal antibody against green fluorescent protein (GFP) (GFP (FL) sc-8334) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA). The anti-GFP antibody was used at a 1:1000 dilution in 0.5% milk/TBST buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). Antibody against human Cullin-1 protein (CUL-1 (H-213)) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Proteasome inhibitor I, lactacystin, MG-132, and E64 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set III from Calbiochem was used at a 1:200 dilution in lysis buffer for immunoblotting and a 1:2000 dilution in washing buffer for immunoprecipitation. Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set III includes 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride, HCl (100 mm), aprotinin (80 μm), bestatin (5 mm), E64 (1.5 mm), leupeptin (2 mm), and pepsin A (1 mm). Anti-HA antibodies used were HA.11 purchased from Covance (Berkeley, CA) for immunoprecipitation, and 3F10 purchase from Roche Diagnostics for immunoblotting. Anti-galactosidase antibody was used at 1:2000 dilution. Cycloheximide purchased from Sigma was prepared in 50% methanol at 30 mg/ml and added to cells at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Oligonucleotides were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA), and DNA sequencing was done by the DNA Sequencing Facility at the University of Chicago Cancer Research Center.Cell Culture—COS and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (10,000 units and 10,000 μgof stock, respectively) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.Plasmid Constructs—Plasmid expressing HA-ERK2, HA-ERK7, HA-ERK7(K43R), pCMV-β-galactosidase, as well as pGreen-Lantern-1 were described previously (2Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The pcDNA-hCul1-N452 plasmid was from Drs. J. Wade Harper and Jianping Jin (Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine). pCW7 and pCW8 are cytomegalovirus (CMV)-driven expression vectors for His6-Myc-ubiquitin (wild type) and His6-Myc-ubiquitin (K48R) (7Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar).ERK7 and ERK2 Chimeric Constructs—Unique site mutagenesis was used to generate new restriction enzyme sites on HA-ERK7 and HA-ERK2 expression vectors. New restriction enzyme sites were created for domain swapping between ERK7 and ERK2. An EcoRV site was created in ERK7 by mutating T to C at nucleotide position 423 using the oligonucleotide 5′-agggatatCtacctgtgt-3′. Similarly, a new EcoRV site was created in ERK2 using an oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-aaagataAtCtatatagta-3′. The slash in the sequence RDI/YIV indicates the junction between ERK7 and ERK2 in the ERK7/2(VI) construct, and the slash in the sequence KDI/YLV indicates the junction between ERK2 and ERK7 in the ERK2/7(VI) construct. A KpnI site was created in HA-ERK2 at nucleotide position 634 with the primer 5′-tggtacCgagctcca-3′. The slash in the sequence WY/RAP indicates the junction between ERK7 and ERK2 in both the ERK2/7(VIII) and ERK7/2(VIII) constructs. Other ERK7/2 and ERK2/7 chimeras and ERK7/GFP chimeric constructs were generated using the overlap extension PCR approach (8Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). The final PCR product was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, pCR3.1 (Invitrogen), using the T-A cloning method.

The total amount of DNA used for transfection was 3–5 μg per 100-mm dish and the ratio of the transfection control vector to test constructs was 1:6 to 1:10. About 24 h after transfection, cells were pooled and split into smaller dishes for a time course of CHX treatment or for proteasome inhibitor treatments.Preparation of Cell Lysate—Cells in culture were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm EGTA, 40 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture as described above). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf bench top centrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C to clear cell debris. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad).Western Blot Analysis—Cell extracts (10–60 μg of protein per lane unless otherwise noted) were resolved by 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in 1× TBST for 1 h, incubated with primary antibodies at appropriate concentrations for 1 h, washed for 30 min, and then incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h. All incubations and washes were done at room temperature. The signal was detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and analyzed by autoradiography or digital imaging. To reprobe membranes with a new antibody, membranes were incubated in a stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol) at 50–55 °C for 30 min and then washed extensively with 1× TBST.Northern Blot Analysis—Cells were transfected as described above and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). 20 μg of total RNA was loaded in each lane, separated, and transferred as previously described (2Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A 32P-labeled β-galactosidase probe was prepared using the Megaprime DNA Labeling System (Amersham Biosciences), and a 32P-labeled antisense-HA oligo probe was prepared as previously described (2Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were diluted into 0.5× RIPA and incubated with specific antibodies on a rotator for 4 h or overnight at 4 °C. Sepharose-Protein A or Sepharose-Protein G was added to each tube, and the tubes were reincubated for another 2 h. The immunocomplexes were washed 3 times with 0.5× RIPA. After washing, 20 μlof2× loading dye was added to the beads, and the tubes were boiled for 5 min to elute proteins from the beads. Eluted proteins were separated by 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose, and the signals were detected by Western blotting and ECL as described above. 600 μg of protein extract from each sample was used for immunoprecipitation and detection of ubiquitinated protein, and 200–300 μg was used for serum induction. The presence of epitope-tagged proteins in the immunoprecipitates was verified by Western analysis with a 3F10 monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope.Pulse-Chase Analysis—Cells transfected with HA-ERK7 were pooled and re-plated to normalize for transfection efficiency. Following incubation in medium deficient in methionine and cysteine, cells were incubated with Tran35S-label (MP Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) for a 30-min pulse. Cells were then incubated in growth medium containing an excess of cold methionine and cysteine until harvested at the indicated time points. HA-ERK7 was immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates using an anti-HA antibody and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was incubated in an autoradiographic enhancer, dried, and analyzed using the STORM 850 system (Amersham Biosciences).Virus Production and Infection of PC12 Cells—The full-length ERK7 and ERK7 tail consisting of the last 193 amino acids were subcloned into the pCLE retroviral vector (9Gaiano N. Kohtz J.D. Turnbull D.H. Fishell G. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 812-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) to generate pCLE-ERK7 and pCLE-ERK7 TAIL, respectively. These constructs were co-transfected into a 293T-derived packaging cell line (Phoenix-gp) along with pHCMV-G, which expresses the VSV-G protein. Phoenix-gp cells were transfected at ∼65% confluency in 75-cm2 flasks by calcium phosphate precipitation using 12.5 μg of each retroviral construct and 14 μg of pHCMV-G DNA. Virus-containing supernatant was harvested at 24 h and used to infect PC12 cells that were plated 24 h earlier at 7 × 105 cells per 100-mm dish. >90% of PC12 cells were infected based on staining (alkaline phosphatase substrate kit IV; Vector Laboratories, Inc.) for the human placental alkaline phosphatase gene contained in the pCLE vector.pCLE-ERK7 and pCLE-ERK7 TAIL Turnover Assay—Cells stably expressing either pCLE-ERK7 or pCLE-ERK7 TAIL were plated at 1 × 106 cells per 60-mm dish. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% horse serum and 50 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were harvested at the time points indicated and 20 μg of each lysate was used for Western analysis with an anti-ERK7 antibody as previously described (2Abe M.K. Kuo W.L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).RESULTSTo compare the expression levels of ERK2 and ERK7, COS cells were transfected with β-galactosidase and either HA-ERK2 or HA-ERK7 on CMV expression vectors. As shown in Fig. 1, ERK2 protein levels were 10–100 times higher than ERK7 at comparable transfection efficiencies. Co-expression of ERK2 and ERK7 in the same cell did not change the relative ERK expression levels. Similarly, co-expression of HA-ERK7 with GFP on CMV expression vectors did not alter the levels of GFP protein (data not shown) suggesting that the difference in expression levels is a property of ERK7 itself and not an indirect effect of ERK7 signaling. However, it is also independent of the state of activation of ERK7, as shown by the kinase-minus (K43R) mutant.To determine whether the regulation of ERK7 expression occurred at the transcriptional level, COS cells transfected with β-galactosidase and HA-ERK2, HA-ERK7, or HA-ERK7(K43R) were lysed and analyzed for mRNA transcripts by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, ERK7 mRNA levels were comparable with those of ERK2. These results indicate that the regulation of ERK7 was likely occurring at a posttranscriptional level.Fig. 2HA-ERK2 and HA-ERK7 transcript levels in COS cells are similar. HA-ERK7, HA-ERK7(K43R), and HA-ERK2 constructs were co-transfected with pCMV β-galactosidase (β-gal) into COS cells, and total RNA was isolated from the cells. Twenty micrograms of total RNA was loaded into each lane, and the RNA was separated in a formaldehyde gel by electrophoresis. Northern blot analyses were performed, and the membranes were probed with 32P-labeled HA antisense oligonucleotides and β-galactosidase antisense DNA fragments. A, analysis of Northern blots by autoradiography. B, plot of transcript levels. Northern blots were scanned with a phosphorimager, and the radioactive bands were quantitated. The levels of HA-ERK7 and HA-ERK7(K43R) transcripts were normalized to the level of HA-ERK2 transcripts. The data plotted represent the average of three independent experiments ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The previous results suggest that protein rather than mRNA stability might be the source of differential ERK expression. To test this possibility, COS cells transfected with HA-ERK2 or HA-ERK7 were treated with cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis, and the stability of the remaining protein determined by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3A, top). The results indicate that ERK7 is degraded with a t½ of about 2 h. In contrast to HA-ERK7, HA-ERK2 is a stable protein and its t½ is longer than 6 h (Fig. 3A, top). Pulse-chase 35S-labeled HA-ERK7 confirmed the short t½ of ∼2 h. (Fig. 3A, middle and bottom panels). To determine whether degradation of ERK7 was mediated by the proteosome, COS cells transfected with HA-ERK7 were pretreated with proteosome inhibitors prior to cycloheximide treatment. ERK7 degradation was blocked by a number of proteosome inhibitors including lactacystin, proteosome inhibitor 1, or MG132, whereas E64, a cysteine protease inhibitor not specific to the proteosome pathway, had no effect (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained when HEK293T cells were used for the experiments (data not shown).Fig. 3ERK7 is rapidly degraded and can be stabilized by proteasome inhibitors. A, analysis of HA-ERK7 and HA-ERK2 protein stability in COS cells. HA-ERK7 and HA-ERK2 were transfected into COS cells. The cells were then incubated with CHX (50 μg/ml) for different lengths of time as indicated. Cell lysates were prepared and the protein extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and chemiluminescent detection as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 10 and 40 μg of protein extracts from HA-ERK2 and HA-ERK7, respectively, were loaded in each lane (top). COS cells were transfected with an HA-ERK7 expression vector, and then metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min. The medium was replaced to chase medium containing excess unlabeled methionine and cysteine, and cell lysates were collected at the various time points indicated. 35S-Labeled HA-ERK7 protein was immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography (middle). The gel was scanned with an imager to quantitate the 35S-labeled protein, and the data were plotted (bottom). B, stabilization of ERK7 with proteosome inhibitors. COS cells were transfected with an HA-ERK7 expression vector, pooled, and divided into smaller dishes. The cells were later treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX), and then harvested at different time points as indicated. For the cells treated with Me SO (DMSO), E64 (50 μm), or proteasome inhibitors (lactacystin, 16.7 2μm; MG132, 50 μm; proteosome inhibitor I, 50 μm), the reagents were added 2 h before the addition of CHX. Following treatment, cells were lysed and the same amount of protein was loaded into each lane for SDS-PAGE analysis. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody and chemiluminescence. These results are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To directly confirm that ERK7 is ubiquitinated, HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-ERK7 and His6-Myc-ubiquitin. Cells were then either untreated or pretreated with proteosome inhibitor 1 to block degradation of ubiquitinated protein. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, anti-Myc, or anti-ERK7 antibodies, and the immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin or anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 4). Analysis of immunoprecipitated HA-ERK7 with anti-ubiquitin antibody shows a series of bands corresponding to protein with different amounts of conjugated ubiquitin. Detection of HA-ERK7 in the Myc-ubiquitin immunoprecipitate and the ERK7 immunoprecipitate indicates that most of the ubiquitinated ERK7 is less conjugated. These results clearly demonstrate that ERK7 is ubiquitinated prior to protein degradation.Fig. 4HA-ERK7 is a ubiquitinated protein. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for HA-ERK7 and His6-Myc-ubiquitin (pCW7). After 36– 48 h, cells were either untreated or treated with proteasome inhibitor I (PSI) for 6 h. Following lysis, cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, anti-Myc, or anti-ERK7 antibodies and then probed with anti-ubiquitin or anti-HA antibodies as indicated. Unmodified HA-ERK7 and immunoglobulin heavy chain are indicated with arrows, and ubiquitinated-HA-ERK7 (Ubi-HA-ERK7) is marked with a bracket. These results are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)One of the three major classes of ubiquitin ligases that recognize and ubiquitinate substrates are the Cullin-based E3 ligases (reviewed in Ref. 10Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Among these E3 ligase complexes are the anaphase promoting complex (APC), the von Hippel Landau tumor suppressor/Elongin BC complex (CBC), and the SCF (Skp1/Cull/F-box protein) that contains Cullin-1 (Cul-1). To determine whether the degradation of ERK7 occurred via the SCF complex, we expressed ERK7 in HEK293T cells in the presence or absence of a mutant human Cullin-1 (hCul-1) comprising the N-terminal 452 amino acids of Cullin-1 that blocks ubiquitination of substrates (11Wu K. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Tan P. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1382-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells were then pretreated with cycloheximide to monitor the rate of protein turnover. The addition of mutant hCul-1 stabilized ERK7 (Fig. 5). The stabilizing effect of the dominant-negative mutant hCul-1 on HA-ERK7 was similar to the stabilizing effect of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 5). These results provide additional evidence that ERK7 is degraded by the proteosome and suggest that ERK7 is degraded by a multisubunit Cullin-based SCF complex.Fig. 5HA-ERK7 protein is stabilized by disrupting SCF complexes with a Cullin-1 mutant. An expression vector for HA-ERK7 and either hCullin-1-N452 (hCul-1-N452) or a vector control were co-transfected into HEK293T cells. A GFP expression vector, pGreen-Lantern-1, was included as a control for transfection efficiency. At 36– 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with MG132 (50 μm) or Me2SO (control) for 2 h before the addition of cycloheximide (CHX). Cells were lysed at different time points after the addition of CHX. 30 μg of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody for detection of HA-ERK7. The membrane was then stripped and re-probed with anti-GFP antibody. These results are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To identify the region(s) in ERK7 that are responsible for its ubiquitination, we generated chimeras between ERK2 and ERK7. Initially, we analyzed a set of mutants and chimeras in which the kinase domains I–V or I–VII were switched (Fig. 6). The kinase domains were analyzed either alone or with the addition of the ERK7 C-terminal tail. To monitor stability, the mutant and chimeric proteins were expressed in either COS or HEK293 cells along with a GFP expression vector to control for transfection efficiency. As shown in Fig. 6C (right panel), the kinase domain of ERK7 (ERK7ΔT) is highly unstable relative to ERK2. Transfer of the N-terminal kinase domains I–V or I–VII from ERK7 to ERK2 resulted in significantly lower expression of the resultant chimeric proteins ERK7/2(VI) and ERK7/2(VIII) (Fig. 6C, right panel). Conversely, substituting kinase domains I–V or I–VII of ERK2 for the comparable domains in the ERK7 kinase lacking the C-terminal tail (ERK2/7(VI)ΔT and ERK2/7(VIII)ΔT) dramatically stabilized the proteins (Fig. 6C, left panel). These findings indicate that a signal promoting the turnover of ERK7 exists within N-terminal kinase domains I–V of ERK7.Fig. 6Both the N- and C-terminal domains of ERK7 contribute to rapid turnover of the ERK7 protein.

Here we report that wild-type (wt) human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), particles were neutralized by higher concentrations of either anti-Env glycoprotein (gp) 41 antibodies or recombinant soluble human CD4 compared with Δnef HIV-1. This appeared to be the result of a Nef-induced increase of virion incorporation of both gp41 (transmembrane (TM)) and surface gp120 Env products likely originating from enhanced steady-state levels of cell membrane-associated Env products. This, in turn, seemed to be the consequence of a reduced retention of the Env precursor. Most interesting, we found that both the Nef-directed increase of Env membrane expression and the Nef-induced enhancement of HIV-1 infectivity relied on the presence of the intracytoplasmic domain of TM, supporting the hypothesis of a functional correlation between these effects. Mutagenesis studies allowed us to establish that the two leucine residues at the TM C terminus, which are part of a sorting motif involved in the control of Env membrane expression, and the 181–210-residue Nef C-terminal region were critically involved in the Nef/Env functional interaction. In conclusion, we propose that Nef increases the infectivity of HIV-1 at least in part by enhancing the amounts of Env products incorporated into virus particles.

Nef is a non-enzymatic, myristoylated protein of 27–34 kDa, expressed exclusively by human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1/2) 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; AP, adaptor complex; dFCS, decomplemented fetal calf serum; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GFP, green fluorescence protein; ICD, intracytoplasmic domain; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PE, phycoerythrin; SIV, simian immunodeficiency virus; SU, surface; TM, transmembrane; VSV-G, glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; wt, wild type; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; rsh, recombinant soluble human; NGFr, nerve growth factor receptor; gp, glycoprotein; geoMFI, geometric mean fluorescence values.1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; AP, adaptor complex; dFCS, decomplemented fetal calf serum; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GFP, green fluorescence protein; ICD, intracytoplasmic domain; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PE, phycoerythrin; SIV, simian immunodeficiency virus; SU, surface; TM, transmembrane; VSV-G, glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; wt, wild type; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; rsh, recombinant soluble human; NGFr, nerve growth factor receptor; gp, glycoprotein; geoMFI, geometric mean fluorescence values. and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) lentiviruses (for reviews see Refs. 1Arold S.T.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Despite its original denomination (i.e. Negative factor), Nef acts as an enhancer of the viral infectivity through mechanisms still not fully clarified. Although previous observations suggested that the expression of Nef in the producer cells increases the retrotranscription activity in the target cells (3Schwartz O. Marechal V. Danos O. Heard J.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4053-4059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Aiken C. Trono D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5048-5056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), more recent papers suggested that Nef acts by increasing the viral infectivity through the stimulation of the intravirion retrotranscription activity (5Khan M. Garcia-Barrio M. Powell M.D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12081-12087Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or by increasing the cytoplasmic delivery of virions through a mechanism acting at the level of viral entry (6Schaeffer E. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2993-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Finally, the possibility that Nef influences the functions of the viral envelope has been proposed (7Zhou J. Aiken C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5851-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). HIV-1 Env products originate from the translation of single spliced viral RNA species into a highly glycosylated gp160 precursor. Most of the Env precursor is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum or in the cis-Golgi compartment (8Willey R.L. Bonifacino J.S. Potts B.J. Martin M.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9580-9584Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 9Crise B. Buonocore L. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5585-5593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Courageot J. Fenouillet E. Bastiani P. Miquelis R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Only a small part of the Env precursor is transported to the trans-Golgi network and then to the cell membrane, where it is inserted upon cleavage by a cell protease. The outcome is the expositions of trimers of the SU gp120 subunit that are retained at the cell membrane through non-covalent interactions with trimers of the transmembrane gp41 subunit (TM) (11Freed E.O. Martin M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23883-23886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This is characterized by a long (i.e. near 150 amino acids) intracytoplasmic domain (ICD) carrying sequences involved in the intracellular trafficking. These include a tyrosine-based, membrane-proximal 712YXXΦ715 motif (where Φ indicates an amino acid with a bulky aliphatic side chain) that induces TM endocytosis by means of the interaction with the adaptor complex (AP)-2 molecules (12Boge M.

Bonifacino J.S. Virology. 1997; 238: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), whereas two additional distal elements have been reported to induce retention at the Golgi apparatus of internalized TM (14Bultmann A. Muranyi W. Seed B. Haas J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5263-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, the well conserved C-terminal dileucine motif of the ICD-TM acts as a retention signal by binding the AP-1 clathrin adaptor, ultimately controlling the levels of Env transported to the cell surface (15Wyss S. Berlioz-Torrent C. Boge M. Blot G. Honing S. Benarous R. Thali M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2982-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Increasing bodies of evidence indicate that the release of infectious lentivirus particles relies on a coordinated interaction among different viral proteins. As an example, it was reported that the interaction between HIV-1 matrix protein and ICD-TM is critical for the correct assembling of infectious HIV-1 particles (16Yu X. Yuan X. Matsuda Z. Lee T.H. Essex M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dorfman T. Mammano F. Haseltine W.A. Gottlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By investigating the mechanisms involved in the Nef-induced increase of HIV-1 infectivity, we observed that both Env products are more efficiently incorporated in wt than in Δnef HIV-1 particles, possibly as the consequence of a Nef-dependent enhanced membrane expression of both Env products. In addition, we established that both the C-terminal dileucine motif of the ICD-TM and the structured Nef C-terminal region were critically involved in such a Nef/Env functional interaction. In sum, our data are consistent with the idea that Nef increases the infectivity of HIV-1 at least in part by enhancing the Env incorporation into the infectious virus particles. Molecular Constructs—All HIV-1 molecular clones were derivatives of the NL4-3 strain (18Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Δnef HIV-1 (19Chowers M.Y. Spina C.A. Kwoh T.J. Fitch N.J. Richman D.D. Guatelli J.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2906-2914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the HIV-1 expressing a TM deprived of the whole ICD (pl94/NL4-3) (20Wilk T. Pfeiffer T. Bosch V. Virology. 1992; 189: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and that deleted of the CD4 binding domain (pl227/NL4-3) have been described preciously (20Wilk T. Pfeiffer T. Bosch V. Virology. 1992; 189: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The Δnef derivative of pl94 was obtained by means of an XhoI-generated frameshift at nucleotide 103. NL4-3 nef and mutants thereof, as well as the VSV-G receptor protein, were expressed under the control of the immediate early cytomegalovirus promoter. The CD8/and ΔNGFr (the low affinity receptor for the human nerve growth factor truncated in its ICD, 21)/ICD-TM constructs were obtained by means of overlapping PCR following the standard procedures. In detail, the sequences coding either the CD8, the ΔNGFr, and the ICD-TM from the NL4-3 strain were amplified from pUc19ΔNGFr (21Mavilio F. Ferrari G. Rossini S. Nobili N. Bonini C. Casorati G. Traversari C. Bordignon C. Blood. 1994; 83: 1988-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pEF-BOS/CD8 (22Baur A.S. Sawai E.T. Dazin P. Fantl W.J. Cheng-Mayer C. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1994; 1: 373-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and pNL4-3 plasmids, respectively. The tyrosine to cysteine or isoleucine amino acid substitutions were created by mutating the first two nucleotides of the tyrosine codon of the 712YXXΦ715 TM domain from TA to TG or AT, respectively. Purified PCR products were then appropriately mixed in a single PCR amplification (100 ng each in 50 μl of final volume of reaction) by using exclusively the forward primer of CD8 or ΔNGFr (carrying the HindIII site) and the reverse primer specific for the ICD-TM (carrying the XbaI site). The final PCR product was purified, HindIII- and XbaI-digested, and inserted in the homologous sites of the pcDNA3 vector. The dileucine ICD-TM deletion mutant was recovered using a TM reverse primer lacking the two C-terminal codons. The enhanced green fluorescence protein (GFP) and the NL4-3 Nef-GFP fusion protein were expressed by immediate early cytomegalovirus-promoted pCsg25GFP and pCNefsg25GFP vectors, respectively. Vectors expressing the Nef mutants fused with GFP were obtained by amplifying each Nef sequence through oligoprimers carrying the SacII and NheI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, and afterward inserting the PCR products in the homologous restriction sites of the pCsg25GFP vector. The construction of the CD8-fused Nef deletion mutants was described previously (22Baur A.S. Sawai E.T. Dazin P. Fantl W.J. Cheng-Mayer C. Peterlin B.M.

All PCR-generated molecular constructs were fully sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method in order to exclude the presence of undesired mutations. Cell Cultures—293T and HeLaCD4 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% decomplemented fetal calf serum (dFCS). CD4 highly positive CEMss and CEM-GFP (24Gervaix A. West D. Leoni L.M. Richman D.D. Wong-Staal F. Corbeil J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4653-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) cells were cultivated in RPMI supplemented with 10% dFCS. CD4+ human peripheral blood lymphocytes were recovered as described previously (25Alessandrini L. Santarcangelo A.C. Olivetta E. Ferrantelli F. D'Aloja P. Pugliese K. Pelosi E. Chelucci C. Mattia G. Peschle C. Verani P. Federico M. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2905-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) from the buffy coat obtained from 20–40-year-old healthy male blood donors, activated with 2 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Sigma), and cultivated in RPMI containing 20% dFCS in the presence of 100 units/ml interleukin-2 (Roche Applied Science). HIV-1 Production and Purification, Infections, and Detection—Supernatants from both 293T-transfected cells and CEMss-infected cells were the source of virus preparations. 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with the respective pNL4-3 molecular clones and, for recovering pseudotyped HIV-1, the VSV-G expressing vector in a 5:1 molar ratio. Supernatants were harvested 48 h thereafter, clarified, and for the most part of purposes, concentrated by ultracentrifugation as described (26Chelucci C. Hassan H.J. Locardi C. Bulgarini D. Pelosi E. Mariani G. Testa U. Federico M. Valtieri M. Peschle C. Blood. 1995; 85: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some instances, the concentrated virus preparations were purified through an additional ultracentrifugation step (SW 60 rotor, 30,000 × g, 4 h at 4 °C) by loading the viral pellet on a 20% sucrose cushion. Virus preparations were also recovered upon the infection of CEMss cells with VSV-G pseudotypes performed by adsorbing the viral inoculum for 1 h at 37 °C and, after washing, seeding the cells at the concentration of 5 × 105/ml and recovering supernatants 48 h after the challenge. For HIV-1 purification, viral pellets recovered upon ultracentrifugation on a 20% sucrose cushion were resuspended in 200 μl of PBS and ultracentrifuged in a 20–60% sucrose gradient for 14 h at 100,000 × g in an SW 60 rotor. Twenty fractions of 200 μl were then collected, diluted to 1.5 ml in PBS, centrifuged for 20 min at 60,000 × g in a TL100 (Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA) ultracentrifuge, and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS. Fractions included in the peak of reverse transcriptase activity were pooled, pelleted as described above, and analyzed by Western blot. Virus preparations were titrated by both anti-p24 Gag quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Abbott), and reverse transcriptase assay (27Rossi G.B. Verani P. Macchi B. Federico M. Orecchia A. Nicoletti L. Buttò S. Lazzarin A. Mariani G. Ippolito G. Manzari V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1987; 511: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The infectivity of different HIV-1 strains was evaluated by infecting CEM-GFP cells with serial dilutions of the viral preparations and scoring the number of green fluorescent cells 48 h after the challenge by FACS. Virus Neutralization Assay—Ten μl of complete medium containing 2 ng of HIV-1 were incubated in 96-well plates for 1 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of complete medium containing dilutions of either the anti-TM mAb 2F5 or the recombinant soluble human (rsh) CD4. Afterward, 2 × 104 CEM-GFP cells were added in a volume of 20 μl and incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. Sixty μl of complete medium was added, and the cultures were carried out for an additional 2 days. Finally, cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed, and the percentages of fluorescent cells scored by FACS. In the case of experiments carried out with untreated HIV-1 supernatants, the cells were scored 4 days after the challenge due to the lower virus input used (i.e. 0.2 ng). HIV-1 Binding Assay—35S-Labeled HIV-1 preparations purified as described above served for the binding assay. These were recovered by transfecting 293T cells with wt or Δnef HIV-1-expressing vectors, labeling cells 24 h later with 1.85 MBq of both 35S-methionine and -cysteine in methionine/cysteine-free medium in the presence of 5% dialyzed dFCS, and recovering supernatants after an additional 24 h. CEMss cells (2.5 × 105) were first incubated at 4 °C with an excess (i.e. 200 ng) of unlabeled HIV-1 strain defective for the CD4-binding site (CD4– HIV-1), in order to saturate the nonspecific binding sites on the cell membrane. After two washings, cells were incubated with increasing amounts (i.e. from 6 to 45 ng, corresponding to 36,000–270,000 cpm) of 35S-labeled wt, Δnef, or CD4– HIV-1 preparations. After an additional hour of incubation at 4 °C, cells were extensively washed, and the cell-bound radioactivity was evaluated upon trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Immunofluorescence Analyses—For the detection of TM on the cell membrane, 3 × 105 HIV-1-infected CEMs cells were incubated with a 1:30 dilution of the MD-1 human anti-TM mAb for 1 h at 4 °C, and, thereafter, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human IgG. The membrane expression of SU was scored similarly, except cells were labeled with a 1:30 dilution of the 4G10 mouse anti-SU mAb. Regardless of the viral receptor detected, cells were then treated with Permeafix (Ortho Diagnostic, Raritan, NJ) for 30 min at room temperature and labeled for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:50 dilution of KC57-RD1 phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-Gag mAb (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). The levels of membrane expression of the CD8/or ΔNGFr/ICD-TM products were evaluated either by direct immunofluorescence analyses using 1:50 dilutions of PE-conjugated anti-CD8 mAb (BD Biosciences) or by indirect FACS analysis by labeling the cells with anti-NGFr mAb (21Mavilio F. Ferrari G. Rossini S. Nobili N. Bonini C. Casorati G. Traversari C. Bordignon C. Blood. 1994; 83: 1988-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, in the second step, with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Protein Detection—Both cells and purified viral preparations cells were lysed in PBS, 1% Triton X-100 in the presence of anti-proteolytic agents. For the preparation of cytoplasmic extracts, whole cell lysates were centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were frozen at –80 °C. Aliquots of 30 μg of total cell proteins were used for the Western blot assays. The following mono- or polyclonal Abs served for the revelation of both virus and cell-associated HIV-1 products: HT3 goat anti-Env gp160 antiserum, Chessie 8 anti-TM mAb, AG3.0 anti-Gag mAb, ARP 444 sheep anti-Nef antiserum, and a pool of human anti-HIV-1 antisera. The pulse-chase labeling assay was performed by infecting CEMss cells with wt or Δnef VSV-G HIV-1 (m.o.i. 0.5) and, 48 h thereafter, labeling the cells either for 1 h with [35S]methionine and -cysteine after 1 h of starvation or for 8 h, in both cases in the presence of 10% dialyzed dFCS. Infected cell cultures were then extensively washed and re-seeded in complete medium. Cells were sampled at different times, and 100 μg of cell lysates was immunoprecipitated overnight with pooled human anti-HIV-1 antisera in the presence of protein A-G-agarose beads (Pierce). Immunoprecipitated proteins were finally resolved in a 10% SDS-PAGE and revealed by autoradiography. Specific signals were quantified by means of an Instant Imager software (Packard Instrument Co.). The Expression of Nef in Virus-producing Cells Correlates with Decreased Sensitivity of the Released Virus Particles to both Anti-TM and Anti-SU Neutralization Factors—By attempting to determine whether the widely reproduced drop in the infectivity of Δnef HIV-1 virions could be related to an altered molecular composition, we sought to evaluate the relative amounts of Env products in the virus particles. This was first approached through a virus neutralization assay carried out by incubating equivalent amounts of wt or Δnef HIV-1 particles with increasing amounts of either anti-TM mAb or rshCD4. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, CEM-GFP cells (i.e. a CEM cell clone expressing the GFP under the control of HIV-1 long terminal repeat in a Tat-dependent manner) (24Gervaix A. West D. Leoni L.M. Richman D.D. Wong-Staal F. Corbeil J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4653-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) were added, and the percentages of infected cells were scored after an additional 48 h by FACS analysis. The number of infected cells was expressed as percent of untreated infected cells. Of note, we found that the wt HIV-1 particles were neutralized with about 10-fold higher doses of anti-TM mAb than Δnef HIV-1 preparations. In particular, the concentrations of anti-TM mAb neutralizing the 50% of wt HIV-1 particles ranged between 27 and 81 ng/ml for the wt HIV-1 and between 3 and 9 ng/ml for the Δnef counterpart. These results were obtained by infecting CEM-GFP cells with equal amounts of wt or Δnef HIV-1 preparations. However, it is well known that the lack of nef expression leads to a reduction in the virus infectivity from 2- to 20-fold, depending on the target cells. This was also true for CEM-GFP cells that in our hands replicate Δnef HIV-1 5-fold less efficiently than wt HIV-1 (not shown). To exclude the possibility that the striking differences we noticed in terms of anti-TM virus neutralization could be influenced by the differences in the infectivity between wt and Δnef HIV-1, we repeated the neutralization assay by increasing the viral input of Δnef HIV-1 by 5-fold. Also, the amounts of anti-TM mAb needed for neutralizing 50% of wt particles exceeded about 10 times those required for Δnef HIV-1 (Fig. 1B). TM and SU products originated from a common gp160 Env precursor. Hence, monitoring the possible effects of Nef on Env SU might be helpful in clarifying which level Nef acts on the Env products. Thus, we repeated the neutralization assay by using different concentrations of rshCD4. Similarly to that already observed for anti-TM mAb, significantly higher doses (i.e. about 10-fold) of rshCD4 were required in order to neutralize 50% of the infectivity of wt compared with Δnef HIV-1 particles (Fig. 1C). Coincident results were obtained using concentrated HIV-1 preparations upon purification on a sucrose cushion (not shown). Finally, we demonstrated that the virus concentration procedures did not influence the outcomes from both the anti-TM and anti-SU neutralization assays. In fact, we reproduced the results obtained previously by also neutralizing unprocessed HIV-1 supernatants (Fig. 1, D and E). The Expression of Nef in the Producer Cells Leads to Increased Incorporation of Env Products in Virus Particles—The lower amounts of anti-Env neutralizing factors required for the neutralization of Δnef compared with wt HIV-1 could imply a defect in the incorporation of Env products in the absence of Nef expression. To test such an hypothesis, we sought to evaluate the amounts of Env proteins in both wt and Δnef virions. Viral particles emerging from CEMss cells infected with VSV-G HIV-1 were purified through a 20–60% sucrose gradient as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two-fold serial dilutions of viral lysates (from 50 to 6.25 ng of Gag p24 for the TM detection and, in view of its fainter signal, from 400 to 100 ng for SU; Fig. 2A) as well as the lysates from the respective producer cells (Fig. 2B) were analyzed by Western blot. Such analyses showed that the amounts of both SU and TM found in wt virions exceeded those detectable in Δnef HIV-1 at 2–4-fold, in the absence of significant differences in the steady-state levels of such viral products in the producer cells (Fig. 2B). Of note, some reductions of both p55 and p32 Gag premature products were also detectable in Δnef HIV-1. Consistent results were obtained by analyzing virus particles 48 h after the transfection of 293T cells with the respective HIV-1 molecular clones (not shown). In summary, we found that the decreased susceptibility to neutralization factors of HIV-1 produced in the presence of Nef coupled with increased virion incorporation of Env products. The Expression of Nef Induces Increased Expression of both TM and SU HIV-1 Proteins at the Cell Membrane—Data reported here indicate that the expression of Nef leads to an increased inclusion of both HIV-1 Env subunits in the virus particles. To inspect the underlying mechanism, we first were interested in evaluating the influence of Nef on the levels of cell membrane-associated Env products. For this purpose, CEMss cells were infected with an m.o.i. of 1 for VSV-G wt or Δnef HIV-1. The use of pseudotypes was necessary for both increasing the overall infection efficiencies and alleviating the strong differences in the infectivity between the two HIV-1 strains. Infected cells were harvested at different times after the challenge, labeled with either anti-TM (Fig. 3A) or anti-SU (Fig. 3B) mAbs, and after cell permeabilization, stained with a mAb detecting HIV-1 Gag-related products. The FACS analyses revealed that the expression of Nef correlated with higher steady-state levels of both Env products at the cell membrane starting 24 h post-infection, as revealed by the increased percentages of double positive cells and/or by the enhanced mean fluorescence intensity values. Of note, such increases did not appear to be related to the extent of the viral genome expression, as indicated by the Gag-related fluorescence intensities. More prolonged observations were hindered by the rapid decline of the cell viability. In conclusion, we established a direct correlation among the Nef expressions in the producer cells, the amount of cell membrane-associated Env products, and the extent of their virion incorporation. The Nef Expression Couples with a Decreased Persistence of the gp160 Env Precursor—Backward in the Env life cycle, we next analyzed whether the presence of Nef could influence the fate of a newly synthesized Env precursor in HIV-1-infected cells. Cells infected with wt or Δnef HIV-1 were labeled for 1 h and harvested at different time points until 8 h after the chase. Both Env gp160 and a product of its cleavage, i.e. SU gp120, were detected by means of immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4A). On the contrary, under these conditions the TM subunit was not reproducibly detectable. No major differences were noticed in such a first set of experiments, suggesting that both the stability and the maturation of the 35S-labeled gp160 Env precursor produced in 1 h of labeling were not affected by Nef. Since the 1 h of labeling allowed detecting Env products no longer than 8 h after the chase, we repeated the pulse-chase assay by prolonging the pulse to 8 h and the chase to 30 h (Fig. 4B). Clearly, under these conditions higher amounts of gp160 Env persisted in Δnef HIV-1-infected cells, as was also detectable by scanning the specific signals (Fig. 4C). Consistently, the gp160/gp120 SU ratio appeared significantly higher in Δnef HIV-1-infected cells both at the steady state and in all chase time points (Fig. 4D). This ratio decreased in the earlier chase time points, increasing between 4 and 24 h, which is indicative of an overall impaired production of Env mature products. Conversely, such a ratio constantly decreased in wt HIV-1-infected cells, which is suggestive of a gradual Env gp160 processing and membrane targeting of its cleavage products. The fact that the expression of Nef correlated with a decreased persistence of the Env precursor is suggestive of its diminished retention at the cis-Golgi. This, in turn, could be the basis of the Nef-dependent increase in Env cell membrane expression we observed previously. Wild-type HIV-1 Binds the Cell Membrane of CD4+ Cells More Efficiently than Δnef HIV-1—Reported data strongly suggest that the presence of Nef in the producer cells increases the levels of Env products incorporated in HIV-1 virions. In order to test the biological relevance of such a finding, we compared the binding activity on CD4+ human cells of wt versus Δnef HIV-1. After a pretreatment at 4 °C with an excess (i.e. 200 ng) of an HIV-1 strain defective for the CD4-binding site (CD4– HIV-1), CEMss cells were incubated with different amounts (i.e. from 6 to 45 ng) of purified, 35S-labeled wt, Δnef, or, as control, CD4– HIV-1 preparations. After an additional hour of incubation at 4 °C, cells were extensively washed, and the cell-associated radioactivity was evaluated upon trichloroacetic acid precipitation. As shown in the Fig. 5, significantly higher amounts (i.e. 1.5–2-fold) of wt than Δnef HIV-1 were found associated with CEMss cells, consistently with the observation that the expression of Nef in the producer cells leads to increased incorporation of Env products into virus particles. The Nef-dependent Increase of Env Products at the Cell Membrane Relies on the Presence of the Intracytoplasmic Domain (ICD) of TM—In o"
https://openalex.org/W2078714850,"It is known that the two types of FK506-binding proteins FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 are tightly associated with the skeletal (RyR1) and cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2), respectively, and their interactions are important for channel functions of the RyR. In the case of cardiac muscle, three amino acid residues (Gln-31, Asn-32, and Phe-59) of FKBP12.6 could be essential for the selective binding to RyR2 (Xin, H. B., Rogers, K., Qi, Y., Kanematsu, T., and Fleischer, S. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 15315-15319). In this study to identify amino acid residues of FKBP12 that are important for the selective binding to RyR1, we mutated 9 amino acid residues of FKBP12 that differ from the counterparts of FKBP12.6 (Q3E, R18A, E31Q, D32N, M49R, R57A, W59F, H94A, and K105A), and we examined binding properties of these mutants to RyR1 by in vitro binding assay by using glutathione S-transferase-fused proteins of the mutants and Triton X-100-solubilized, FKBP12-depleted rabbit skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Among the nine mutants tested, only Q3E and R18A lost their selective binding ability to RyR1. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation of RyR1 with 33 various mutants for the 9 positions produced by introducing different size, charge, and hydrophobicity revealed that an integration of the hydrogen bonds by the irreplaceable Gln-3 and the hydrophobic interactions by the residues Arg-18 and Met-49 could be a possible mechanism for the binding of FKBP12 to RyR1. Therefore, these results suggest that the N-terminal regions of FKBP12 (Gln-3 and Arg-18) and Met-49 are essential and unique for binding of FKBP12 to RyR1 in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2156440761,"B1 bradykinin receptor (B1R) induction is critical in the adaptation of the kinin-mediated inflammatory response from a B2 bradykinin receptor (B2R) subtype to a B1R subtype that occurs during chronic insult. Here, we show that B1R spontaneously forms a proteolytic plasma membrane complex with B2R along with increased receptor signaling capacity. Co-expression of hemagglutinin-tagged B2R with FLAG-tagged B1R in HEK293 cells resulted in degradation of B2R as determined by the diminution of the intact 65-kDa B2R species and the appearance of proteolytic B2R products at 30–40 kDa and by the reduction in B2R bradykinin binding sites. On the other hand, the 35-kDa B1R remained intact. Receptor co-expression also led to an increase in constitutive and agonist-stimulated receptor signaling. Selective immunoprecipitation with epitope-specific antibodies revealed a spontaneously formed heterologous receptor complex, which was composed of the intact 35-kDa B1R and the B2R degradation products. Cellular fractionation, cell surface biotinylation, and immunoelectron microscopy showed that B2R·B1R complexes were present on the cell surface. This is the first evidence that a heterologous G protein-coupled receptor complex in the plasma membrane is linked to proteolytic degradation of a participating receptor, and this mechanism may contribute to the adaptation of the kinin response from a B2 type to a B1 type during chronic insult. B1 bradykinin receptor (B1R) induction is critical in the adaptation of the kinin-mediated inflammatory response from a B2 bradykinin receptor (B2R) subtype to a B1R subtype that occurs during chronic insult.

This is the first evidence that a heterologous G protein-coupled receptor complex in the plasma membrane is linked to proteolytic degradation of a participating receptor, and this mechanism may contribute to the adaptation of the kinin response from a B2 type to a B1 type during chronic insult. Kinins are potent agonists who participate in the inflammatory and pain responses to insults by acting through two receptor subtypes named B1 and B2 (1Couture R. Harrisson M. Vianna R.M. Cloutier F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 429: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). During sustained insult, the kinin-mediated response adapts from a B2 type in the acute phase to a B1 type in the chronic phase (2Dray A. Perkins M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 99-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). This adaptation is explained in part by an induction of B1R 1The abbreviations used are: B1R, B1 receptor; B2R, B2 receptor; FB1, FLAG-tagged B1 receptor; HB2, hemagglutinin-tagged B2 receptor; BK, bradykinin; DK, desArg10kallidin; PI, phosphoinositide; WT, wild-type; HA, hemagglutinin. from essentially a null level, which is triggered by pro-inflammatory cytokines (3Marceau F.

B1R induction may be necessary to prolong the kinin response because it has been observed that the cellular B2 response desensitizes rapidly, whereas the B1 response is sustained (6Mathis S.A. Criscimagna N.L. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 128-129PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, B1R is constitutively active, i.e. active in the absence of agonist (7Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Kang D.S. Lamb M.E. Mathis S. Fathy D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8785-8792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is now well established that G protein-coupled receptors are capable of hetero-oligomerizing in the cell (8Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), but in only a few cases has a direct causal relationship been established between a hetero-oligomer and a functional outcome. The best described hetero-oligomeric G protein-coupled receptor system is the GABAB receptor, in which the type 1 receptor is responsible for recognizing GABA, the type 2 receptor for agonist-dependent receptor G protein coupling, and expression of both receptors is required for proper trafficking to the plasma membrane (9Jones K.A.

Other heterologous G protein-coupled receptor combinations have revealed receptor trans-activation and changes in pharmacological profiles, agonist efficacy, and receptor internalization. B1R and B2R subtypes are co-expressed on many cell structures on which B1R induction may be readily observed including primary sensory neurons, which are critical for the pain response (12Wohlfart P. Dedio J. Wirth K. Schölkens B.A. Wiemer G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 1109-1116PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tropea M.M. Gummelt D. Herzig M.C.S. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cellular cross-talk between B1R and B2R occurs via bradykinin (BK) stimulation of B2R, which leads to an autocrine up-regulation of B1R through an interleukin-1β-mediated mechanism (16Phagoo S.B. Poole S. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Also, in some cells that co-express the receptors, such as PC3 prostate cancer cells, the pharmacological profile of kinin signaling through each receptor subtype suggests the co-engagement of the other subtype in the response (15Barki-Harrington L. Bookout A.L. Raj G.V. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Daaka Y. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). On this basis, we hypothesized that in cells that co-express B1R and B2R, these receptors directly interact to enhance signaling. In this report we investigated the effect of heterologous co-expression of B1R and B2R. Our results show that B1R promotes the formation of a plasma membrane complex with B2R, which involves proteolytic degradation of B2R along with increased constitutive and agonist-stimulated kinin receptor signaling. This event may be part of a cellular adaptation of kinin signaling in the inflammatory and pain response from a B2 type to a B1 type that occurs during sustained insult. Cell Culture, Mutation, and Transfection—HEK293 cells were grown, and mutations and transfections were done as described previously (7Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Kang D.S. Lamb M.E. Mathis S. Fathy D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8785-8792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The FLAG and HA epitopes were inserted at the receptor N terminus immediately following the initial methionine. Plasma Membrane Fractionation—Enrichment of plasma membranes followed the procedure by Smart et al. (17Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), with a few modifications as described previously by us (18Lamb M.E. Zhang C. Shea T. Kyle D.J. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14340-14347Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Functional Receptor Assays—Receptor activities were assayed by monitoring PI hydrolysis in cells transfected with a series of receptor cDNA amounts and labeled with 1 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol as described previously (7Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Kang D.S. Lamb M.E. Mathis S. Fathy D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8785-8792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). B1R and B2R densities were determined using saturating concentrations (2–3 nm) of [3H]DK and [3H]BK (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), respectively. The slope factors of the increases in basal cellular PI hydrolysis and agonist-stimulated PI hydrolysis as a function of the level of receptor expression were used as parameters of constitutive and agonist-dependent receptor activity. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cells were biotinylated with 4 ml of 0.3 mg/ml non-permeable polyethylene oxide-maleimide activated biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed two times with ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline, and quenched with 1 mm dithiothreitol/phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at 4 °C. After washing three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were immunoprecipitated and electroblotted as described below. Biotinylated receptors were detected with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation and/or immunoblotting essentially as described previously (7Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Kang D.S. Lamb M.E. Mathis S. Fathy D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8785-8792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, the lysate was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:300; Stratagene), anti-HA antibody (1:300; Covance), or polyclonal antibodies raised against the B1R and B2R C-terminal tail residues 317–353 (anti-B1R-(317–353)) and 310–364 (anti-B2R-(310–364)), respectively (18Lamb M.E. Zhang C. Shea T. Kyle D.J. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14340-14347Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads with or without precoupled rabbit antimouse IgG. For immunoblotting, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (6% β-mercaptoethanol) on 12% gels, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and then stained with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:1000) or anti-HA antibody (1:1000). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with a chemiluminescence immunodetection kit using peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse antibody according to the procedure described by the supplier (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoelectron Microscopy—The FLAG and HA antibodies were labeled with colloidal gold of different sizes (5 and 11 nm, respectively), as described previously (19Baschong W. Wrigley N.G. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1990; 14: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cells co-expressing FLAG-tagged B1R (FB1) and HA-tagged B2 receptor (HB2) were incubated with the gold-labeled antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were fixed for 1 h at room temperature and then fixed overnight at 4 °C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.15 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4 (cacodylate buffer). The fixed samples were washed with cacodylate buffer and postfixed for 1 h at room temperature in 1% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer. The samples were then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in Epon 812 using acetone as intermediate solvent. Specimens were sectioned with a diamond knife into 50-nm-thick, ultrathin sections on an LKB ultramicrotome. The sections were then stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Specimens were observed in a Jeol JEM 1230 electron microscope operated at 80 kV accelerating voltage. Images were recorded with a Gatan Multiscan 791 charge-coupled device camera. Data Analysis—Where indicated, data are presented as the mean ± S.E. and were compared using Student's t test. Identification of Human B1R and B2R and Their Relative Level of Glycosylation—To study the consequence of B1R and B2R co-expression, the respective receptors were structurally modified with the FLAG and HA epitopes at their N termini and then expressed in HEK293 cells. The 35-kDa FB1 (Fig. 1A, lane 2) and 65-kDa hemagglutinin-tagged B2R (HB2) (Fig. 1B, lane 2) were then monitored with epitope-specific antibodies and antibodies against human B1R C-terminal residues 317–353 (anti-B1R-(317–353)) and human B2R C-terminal tail residues 310–364 (anti-B2R-(310–364)). The different relative molecular mass of intact B2R and B1R was due to differential N-linked glycosylation. As shown in Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4, treatment of anti-B2R-(310–364) immunoprecipitates with 2 units of PNGase F for 2 h at 37 °C promoted a decrease in the relative mass of HB2 from 65 kDa to ∼40 kDa. On the other hand, treatment of anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates did not change the relative mass of FB1 (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). B1R-promoted Proteolytic Processing of B2R—Co-expression of HB2 and WT B1R resulted in the diminution of the intact 65-kDa HB2 species and the appearance of heterogeneous products at 30–40 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 3). The B1R-promoted effect on B2R was also observed in a highly enriched plasma membrane fraction of the cell (Fig. 2C, top panel, lane 4). The effect of B1R on B2R was dose-dependent (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–6) and was paralleled by the loss of cell surface binding sites for the selective B2R agonist [3H]BK (Fig. 2D) (69 ± 8% of control binding at 2 μg of B1R DNA). On the other hand, B2R did not alter either the integrity of the 35-kDa FB1 (Fig. 2C, bottom panel, lanes 4 and 5) or the cell surface binding sites for the selective B1R agonist [3H]DK (Fig. 2D). Neither the WT serotonin 5HT2A receptor nor the WT chemokine receptor CXCR4 had any apparent effect on B2R integrity (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5) or [3H]BK binding (100 ± 2% of control binding at 2 μg of CXCR4 DNA). Furthermore, B1R had no apparent effect on the integrity of FLAG-tagged CXCR4 (data not shown). To directly address whether B2R was proteolytically degraded, we compared HB2 expressed alone and together with B1R, immunoprecipitated with anti-B2R-(310–364) antibody, and then immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. Proteolytic cleavage would be indicated if, after introduction of B1R, the HA antibody, which recognizes the B2 receptor N-terminal tail, reacted less with the anti-B2R-(310–364) immunoprecipitate, which recognizes the B2 receptor C-terminal tail. Fig. 2E shows an almost complete loss of anti-HA reactivity after co-expression of HB2 with B1R. These results provide direct evidence that the decrease in B2R molecular mass is caused by proteolytic B2R cleavage. Spontaneous Formation of Proteolytic Hetero-oligomeric B1R and B2R Complexes—Relatively stable detergent-resistant homo-oligomeric B1R structures were readily apparent on gels (Fig. 1A, lane 2, and Fig. 2C, bottom panel, lanes 4 and 5). To determine whether the B1R-promoted degradation of B2R involved receptor hetero-oligomerization, attempts were made to co-immunoprecipitate the two receptors. Immunoprecipitation of HB2 with HA antibodies yielded the co-precipitation of FB1 (Fig. 3A, top panel, lane 4). Also, the FB1 immunoprecipitate contained HB2 activity whether FB1 had been captured with anti-FLAG (Fig. 3A, bottom panel, lane 3) or anti-B1R-(317–353) antibodies (Fig. 3B, lane 2). Interestingly, this HB2 activity was exclusively that of the degradation products. Mixing lysates from cells expressing each receptor individually did not yield any FB1 activity in the HB2 precipitate (Fig. 3C, lane 4). Furthermore, FLAG-tagged CXCR4 did not co-precipitate with HB2 (Fig. 3C, lane 5). These results show that B1R and B2R form a hetero-oligomeric complex in the cell, and this complex is specifically composed of the intact 35-kDa B1R and the proteolytically degraded B2R products. Fig. 3D shows that the B2R products were distinct from and smaller than the deglycosylated B2R, providing further evidence that the products are the result of proteolytic degradation. The degree of B1R-promoted B2R proteolysis is difficult to assess but assumed to be relatively extensive because (a) probably only a fraction of the cells is co-transfected with our transient transfection protocol and (b) very little, if any, intact B2R is complexed with B1R. Plasma Membrane Localization of the Hetero-oligomeric B1R and B2R Complexes—To establish a plasma membrane localization of the proteolytic B1R·B2R complex beyond that of subcellular fractionation (see Fig. 2C), cell surface biotinylation with a membrane-impermeable biotin analogue was performed. Fig. 4, lane 2, clearly shows the presence of biotinylated cell surface FB1. Interestingly, a clearly detectable amount of these receptors was present in the HB2 precipitate (Fig. 4, lane 3). This association was cell-dependent because mixing lysates from biotinylated cells expressing each receptor individually did not result in biotinylated receptor co-precipitation (Fig. 4, lane 4). Plasma membrane-associated hetero-oligomeric B2R and B1R complexes were also investigated using immunoelectron microscopy. To do so, FLAG antibodies were labeled with 5-nm gold particles, whereas the HA antibodies were labeled with 11-nm gold particles. The antibodies were then incubated with cells co-expressing FB1 and HB2 at 4 °C. As shown in Fig. 5, the gold particles were located exclusively on the surface of the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the majority of the gold particles existed as dimeric combinations of one 5-nm particle and one 11-nm particle. These results provide direct evidence that B1R and B2R form dimers in the plasma membrane. No higher order complexes were identified. However, such complexes cannot be completely excluded because steric hindrance may prevent them from being labeled. Kinetics of Hetero-oligomeric B1R and B2R Complex Formation—To address which receptor is rate-limiting in the complex formation, FB1 and HB2 were first transfected at different DNA ratios (μg/μg) and co-precipitated with HA antibodies. Co-precipitation was dose-dependent because maintaining the ratio at 2 but increasing the total amount of transfected receptors from 2:1 to 4:2 increased the amount of FB1 in the HB2 precipitate (Fig. 6A). Increasing the amount of HB2 relative to FB1 by 2-fold (2:1 to 2:2 or 4:1 to 4:2) decreased the amount of FB1 in the precipitate, whereas increasing the amount of FB1 relative to HB2 by 2-fold (2:1 to 4:1 or 2:2 to 4:2) dramatically increased the amount. Thus, B1R is rate-limiting in complex formation. Furthermore, the complex forms spontaneously because neither the B1R agonist DK nor the B2 agonist BK nor kallidin, a less selective receptor agonist, had any apparent effect on the amount of FB1 in the precipitate (Fig. 6B). Increased Signaling of the Hetero-oligomeric B1R and B2R Complexes—Next, we analyzed whether the spontaneous B1R and B2R interaction is also indicated at the functional level. We have shown previously that B1R is constitutively active because it dose-dependently increases PI hydrolysis in the absence of agonist (Fig. 7B, Mock), whereas B2R is essentially inactive on its own (Fig. 7A, Mock) (7Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F.

Interestingly, in the presence of a constant amount of B1R, which by itself partially increased PI hydrolysis, B2R dose-dependently increased basal PI hydrolysis with a slope that was at least 14-fold higher than that in the absence of B1R (Fig. 7A). An increase (2-fold) in constitutive signaling also occurred when B2R was held constant and B1R was varied (Fig. 7B). Neither mock-transfection with pcDNA3 nor co-transfection with CXCR4 caused a change in B2R activity (data not shown). Fig. 7C shows that B1R and B2R co-expression also increased the ability of B1R to be stimulated by 1 μm desArg9BK. This response remained B1R-specific because desArg10[Leu9]kallidin, a highly selective B1 antagonist, effectively inhibited the response, whereas the selective B2 inverse agonist NPC17731 did not inhibit the response (data not shown). Furthermore, NPC17731 had no effect on the increase in basal PI hydrolysis caused by coexpression, excluding the conversion of B2R to a more active conformational state as the source of this increase (20Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. Herzig M.C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25970-25973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Fathy D.B. Leeb T. Mathis S.A. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol.

These results show that the spontaneous interaction of B1R and B2R is functionally significant and translates into an increased coupling efficacy of the receptor to Gq and subsequent phospholipase Cβ activity. Our observation is, to our knowledge, the first to implicate proteolysis of a G protein-coupled receptor in its participation in an oligomeric plasma membrane receptor complex. Such complexes are novel species that may have broad significance in receptor signaling and regulation, and the complexes and the involved protease(s) could represent new targets for therapeutic intervention. Multiple approaches were used to show spontaneously formed functional hetero-oligomeric B1R and B2R complexes. These include receptor co-immunoprecipitation using epitope-specific antibodies against both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the receptors, direct identification of complexes by immunoelectron microscopy using antibodies labeled with differently sized gold particles, and constitutive receptor activity. The immunoelectron microscopy indicated the presence of receptor dimers. Regulated proteolytic degradation of plasma membrane receptors through endocytic targeting to lysosomes is well characterized (22von Zastrow M. Parkinsonism Relat. Disord. 2001; 7: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recently, increased attention has been drawn to plasma membrane proteolysis in receptor function (23Brown M. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 24Coughlin S. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar, 25Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). It is most likely that the degraded B2R products are formed after B1R and B2R complex formation rather than before it. Indeed, when in a complex with B1R, B2R may become susceptible to an intracellular or membrane-bound protease that may or may not have been recruited by B1R or to which B2R is recruited by B1R. Furthermore, hetero-oligomeric B2R may be more prone to degradation than homo-oligomeric B2R, which has been shown to exist (26AbdAlla S. Zaki E. Lother H. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26079-26084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Whether or not an endocytic mechanism is involved in the proteolysis is not clear, but this possibility cannot be excluded because the complex may recycle from an intracellular degradative compartment back to the plasma membrane. Alternatively, proteolysis may occur while the receptors are in the endoplasmic reticulum or en route to the surface, if complexes are capable of forming at these points. The presence of a spontaneously formed proteolytic receptor complex in the plasma membrane that correlates with increased constitutive and agonist-stimulated receptor signaling efficacy argues strongly that the complex is functionally significant. The lack of effect of the B2R inverse agonist NPC17731 suggests that the increase involves an allosteric enhancement by the B2R fragment of the inherent signaling of B1R. Indeed, this effect may be related to that which B2R elicits by hetero-oligomerizing with the angiotensin II AT1 receptor (27AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The possibility that B2R and B1R are typical protease-activated receptors seems unlikely because kinins are their natural receptor ligands. It has been reported that B2R is activated in cell culture by some extracellular proteases, which could be released from neutrophils and bacteria during insult, but without any direct evidence for receptor proteolysis (28Hecquet C. Tan F. Marcic B.M. Erdös E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Starving the cells in the absence of serum for 24 h had no effect on B2R degradation, suggesting a cell-associated plasma membrane-bound or intracellular protease rather than a serum-derived extracellular protease as the cause of the degradation. Induction of B1R expression by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β is an important mechanism underlying the adaptation of the kinin-mediated inflammatory pain response from a B2 type to a B1 type during chronic insult. Considering that these receptor subtypes are co-expressed on numerous cellular structures including primary sensory neurons, which are critical for the pain response, a proteolytic B1R·B2R complex could be involved in assuring the fading of the B2-type response and in augmenting the kinin signal. Indeed, a proteolytic plasma membrane mechanism to remove B2R may be necessary because this receptor (a) recycles relatively rapidly after agonist-promoted internalization (29Munoz C.M. Cotecchia S. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Bachvarov D.R. Houle S. Bachvarova M. Bouthillier J. Adam A. Marceau F. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Their close relatives, ryanodine receptors (RyR), are another family of intracellular Ca2+ channels with a more restricted distribution and different modes of regulation (2Sitsapesan R. Williams A.J.

The last two TMD, together with the intervening loop from each of the four subunits, form the pore (11Ramos-Franco J. Galvan D. Mignery G.A. Fill M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although the transmembrane topology of RyR subunits is unresolved, they are known to have an even number of TMD (probably six or eight) (12Du G.G. Sandu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and, as with IP3R, the last pair of TMD form the pore (13Balshaw D. Gao L. Meissner G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

For both IP3R and RyR, the last pair of TMD, together with ∼25 conserved residues lying ∼35 residues downstream of them, are also major determinants of assembly of the tetrameric protein (10Galvan D.L.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Evidence that some IP3R contain sialic acid (31Khan A.A. Steiner J.P. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar). Even within the ER, IP3R are not uniformly distributed. The complex spatial organization of IP3-evoked Ca2+ signals suggests that IP3R (and RyR) form unevenly distributed clusters (33Seymour-Laurent K.J. Barish M.E. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2592-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Lipp P.

IP3R are concentrated in specific regions of some cells, for example, the apical pole of pancreatic acini (37Petersen O.H. Burdakov D. Tepikin A.V. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but are excluded from others, for example, the dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons, which express RyR but not IP3R (17Sharp A.H.

Neuron. 2001; 31: 115-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). IP3R associate with a bewildering array of additional proteins (39Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar), and many of these associations are likely to be important in determining the subcellular distribution of IP3R. An interaction between residues close to the N-terminal of the IP3R and Homer, for example, can facilitate targeting of IP3R to dendritic spines (38Sala C. Piëch V. Wilson N.R. Passafaro M. Liu G. Sheng M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 115-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) and allows IP3R to specifically associate with other signaling proteins in the plasma membrane, notably metabotropic glutamate receptors (40Tu J.C.

ER-resident proteins can maintain their location either because they never leave the ER (they may either lack export signals or express retention signals) or because they are actively retrieved from the Golgi. Soluble proteins (and a few type II membrane proteins) are retained within the ER by a C-terminal KDEL motif (42Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms responsible for retaining membrane proteins (particularly multi-spanning membrane proteins; Ref. 43Heinrich S.U. Rapaport T.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) are neither so well established nor as universal (44Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). A cytosolic di-lysine motif at the C-terminal (KKXX or more rarely KXKXX) allows COP1-mediated retrieval of ER-resident membrane proteins (44Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 45Zerangue N. Malan M.J. Fried S.R. Dazin P.F. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Schwappach B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2431-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Neither IP3R nor RyR have appropriately positioned di-lysine motifs. Cytosolic di-arginine motifs (RR or RXR) also mediate ER targeting: they are effective wherever they are expressed, although surrounding residues influence the strength of the signal (45Zerangue N. Malan M.J. Fried S.R. Dazin P.F. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Schwappach B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2431-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). There are 11 such sites distributed between the two major cytosolic domains of IP3R1, but neither of the C-terminal sequences satisfies the criteria for the most effective retention signals (45Zerangue N. Malan M.J. Fried S.R. Dazin P.F. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Schwappach B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2431-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A cytosolic C-terminal sequence (YXXLXXRX), similar to the tyrosine-based endocytic signal (46Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar), can also mediate ER retention (47Mallabiaberrena A. Jimenez M.A. Rico M. Alarcon B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2257-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but it is absent from IP3Rs. TMDs can also serve as ER localization signals for membrane proteins of various topologies (48Sato K. Sato M. Nakano A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9693-9698Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TMDs with centrally placed polar residues (49Sato K. Sato M. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3605-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) can interact with Rer1p, which allows ER retrieval from the cis Golgi in COPI vesicles. Short TMD (<17 residues) with hydrophilic residues down one face may also promote ER targeting (50Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1970-1975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 51Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Borgese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1832-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Finally, some proteins may be trapped within the ER because they form large oligomeric structures that are too large to move onward (53Schweizer A. Rohrer J. Huari H.-P. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and others by luminal signals that have yet to be defined (54Mottola G. Jourdan N. Castaldo G. Malagolini N. Lahm A.

Different retention and retrieval signals are likely to collaborate to target native ER membrane proteins (47Mallabiaberrena A. Jimenez M.A. Rico M. Alarcon B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2257-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 55Sato M. Sato K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Previous work established that IP3Rs lacking the entire N-terminal cytosolic region were targeted to the ER (18Takei K. Mignery G.A. Mugnaini E. Südhof T.C. De Camilli P.

For RyR too, deletion of much of the N-terminal region failed to affect targeting to the ER and the final TMD (homologous with TMD6 of IP3R), though not other TMDs, was sufficient to retain a plasma membrane protein in the ER (58Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8597-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that IP3R1 contains redundant ER-targeting sequences. Any pair of TMD ensures effective targeting to, and retention within, ER membranes, and either TMD of the last pair is retained within the ER membrane, albeit less effectively than pairs of TMD. We discuss the relative effectiveness of different TMD in the context of known ER retention signals and the implications for selective targeting of IP3R (and other intracellular Ca2+ channels) to different subcellular locations. Cell Culture and Transfections—COS-7 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 5.6 mm glucose, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generation of Expression Constructs—Full-length rat type 1 IP3R (lacking the S1 splice site) (59Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer B.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and various fragments of it (see Fig. 1) were subcloned in-frame into the pC1-EYFP vector (Clontech). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change a single residue in the pore region (VG2550DVLR to VGAVLR) of all fragments that included the TMD5-6 region to inactivate the channel (60Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). ICAM-EYFP and chimeras of EYFP-tagged IP3R fragments with ICAM (see Fig. 1) were generated by PCR amplification from the pC1-EYFP clones and then ligated into a vector containing ICAM-1 (a gift from Dr Mark Davis, Stanford University; Ref. 61Wulfing C. Sjaastad M.D. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6302-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The pC1-EYFP and pECFP-ER vectors were from Clontech. Confocal Imaging—COS-7 cells were grown to near confluence on glass coverslips, transfected as above, and 20 h after transfection, they were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. After fixation, cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.1%, 10 min) and blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 10 min. A rabbit anti-calreticulin antiserum (Calbiochem, 1:100 in PBS with 5% BSA) was then added for 2.5 h at 20 °C, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with a goat anti-rabbit Cy5-coupled secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:500 in PBS with 5% BSA) for 1 h at 20 °C. After three washes with PBS and a rinse in distilled water, coverslips were mounted in 85% glycerol with 2.5% n-propyl gallate and stored at -20 °C. Two methods were used to identify mitochondria. Transfected cells were incubated in the normal culture medium supplemented with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (100 nm, 30 min at 37 °C; Molecular Probes) or they were co-transfected with pDsRed1-Mito (Clontech) and the usual YFP constructs. In both cases, cells were washed and fixed as above. All imaging was performed using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 scanning confocal microscope. Images were imported into Adobe Photoshop™ and adjusted to use the full range of pixel intensities. Western Blotting, Cross-linking, and Deglycosylation—Membranes were collected from transfected COS-7 cells 24 h after transfection. Cells were washed twice, scraped into ice-cold PBS containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), lysed by 30 passages through a 25-gauge needle, and the membranes were collected by centrifugation (30,000 × gav, 30 min). For cross-linking and deglycosylation experiments, washed cells (from a 35-mm dish) were collected directly into lysis medium (300 μl, 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, the protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.4), sonicated for 3 min, and left on ice for 30 min. For cross-linking, 0.1 mm bis(sulfosuccininimidyl) suberate (Sigma) was added to samples (100 μl), and they were incubated at 20 °C. After 20 min, reactions were quenched by the addition of ammonium acetate (20 μl, final concentration = 170 mm). The susceptibility of proteins to endoglycosidase H (final activity 0.01 units/100 μl, Roche Applied Science) and N-glycosidase F (1 unit/100 μl, Roche Applied Science) was assessed by incubating samples at 37 °C for 4 h. Reactions were terminated by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 4-12% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen), transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore), and the EYFP-tagged proteins were identified by using affinity-purified rabbit anti-GFP antibodies, which also recognize YFP and CFP (AbCam, 1:1000), and horse radish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antiserum (AbCam, 1:2000). Antibody binding was detected by Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Perbio). Targeting of IP3R to the ER by Pairs of TMD—Western blotting and immunocytochemistry established that full-length IP3R1 tagged at its N-terminal with YFP could be expressed in COS-7 cells; others have shown that this tagged IP3R functions normally (57Nakayama T. Hattori M. Uchida K. Nakamura T. Tateishi Y. Bannai H. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Expression of fragments of the IP3R that included the pore region (TMD5-6) perturbed the morphology of the cells. Because such fragments would be expected to form permanently open channels (11Ramos-Franco J. Galvan D. Mignery G.A. Fill M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 57Nakayama T. Hattori M. Uchida K. Nakamura T. Tateishi Y. Bannai H. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we expressed the same IP3R fragments but with a point mutation (Asp2550 → Ala) to disable the pore (60Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The morphology of cells expressing the mutated fragments was indistinguishable from normal cells. In all subsequent experiments with fragments that included TMD5-6, IP3R with the pore mutation were used. The fragments used (and their nomenclature) are shown in Fig. 1. An antibody to calreticulin (a protein restricted to the ER lumen; Ref. 62Michalak M. Corbett E.F. Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) and CFP-ER (CFP tagged with the signal sequence of calreticulin at its N terminus and KDEL at its C terminus) revealed a characteristic ER structure, with strong perinuclear fluorescence and a tubular network extending toward the cell periphery (Fig. 2, B and C). Expression of YFP alone produced a very different pattern that was clearly not coincident with calreticulin staining (Fig. 2A), confirming that YFP is not itself targeted to the ER. Full-length IP3R colocalized with both ER markers (Fig. 2, B and C). We cannot exclude the presence of IP3Rs in the Golgi and ERGIC, but there was no evidence for their selective concentration within either (not shown, and see below). These results confirm the prevailing view that most IP3 receptors in most cells are targeted to the ER (3Taylor C.W. Genazzani A.A. Morris S.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A confirms earlier work (18Takei K. Mignery G.A. Mugnaini E. Südhof T.C. De Camilli P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 327-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 56Sayers L.G. Miyawaki A. Muto A. Takeshita H. Yamamoto A. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem.

J. 2004; 377: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) by demonstrating that the large N-terminal cytosolic portion of the IP3R is not required for targeting to the ER, but goes further by showing that the C-terminal tail, which includes putative ER-retention signals (see beginning of text) can also be deleted (Fig. 3B). The latter observation is consistent with a report that full-length IP3R1 truncated immediately after TMD6 targets to the ER (18Takei K. Mignery G.A. Mugnaini E. Südhof T.C. De Camilli P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 327-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Our results establish, therefore, that the region including the six TMD is all that is required to retain IP3R in the ER. Indeed, any pair of TMD together with the linking luminal loop (TMD1-2, TMD3-4, TMD5-6) is sufficient to retain the protein in the ER (Fig. 3, C-E). After centrifugation of cell homogenates, IP3R fragments were detected only in the membrane pellet, whereas CFP-ER was distributed equally between supernatant and membrane fractions (Fig. 3F). The distribution of CFP-ER presumably reflects release of this soluble protein from ER damaged during homogenization. The clear difference between CFP-ER and IP3R fragments confirms that the latter were not trapped within the ER lumen but were incorporated into the ER membrane. TMD of IP3R Retain a Plasma Membrane Protein in the ER—To establish whether IP3R-targeting sequences could redirect other membrane proteins to the ER, we attached them to a plasma membrane protein, ICAM-1, which is a glycoprotein with a large extracellular N-terminal domain and a single TMD (63Bella J. Rossman M.G. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A confirms the plasma membrane localization of YFP-ICAM, which is clearly very different from the distribution of calreticulin. Attaching the TMD fragments of the IP3R that were targeted to the ER to the C-terminal of ICAM caused the chimeric proteins to be both inserted into membranes (Fig. 4F) and targeted to the ER (Fig. 4, B-E). We conclude that any pair of TMD from IP3R1 linked by a luminal loop is sufficient to retain an integral plasma membrane protein in the ER membrane. IP3R Retention Sequences Prevent IP3R from Reaching the Medial Golgi—Glycosylation of N-linked glycoproteins begins in the ER and continues in the Golgi, where attachment of a terminal N-acetylglucosamine in the medial Golgi renders the glycoprotein insensitive to endoglycosidase H (32Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar, 64Velasco A. Hendricks L. Moreman K.W. Tulsiani D.R.P. Touster O. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Glycoproteins remain sensitive to N-glycosidase F throughout this processing. The sensitivity of glycoproteins to endoglycosidase H, therefore, reveals whether they have progressed to the medial Golgi. There are only two glycosylation sites on rat IP3R1 (Asn2476 and Asn2504) (9Michikawa T. Hamanaka H. Otsu H. Yamamoto A. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Tashiro Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9184-9189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and both are present in the luminal loop linking TMD5 and TMD6. Full-length IP3R and all fragments that include TMD5-6 migrated on SDS-PAGE (usually as a doublet) with a molecular mass greater than that predicted from their primary sequences, and they were sensitive to treatment with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 5A). Earlier work had likewise established that full-length IP3Rs were sensitive both to N-glycosidase F (9Michikawa T. Hamanaka H. Otsu H. Yamamoto A. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Tashiro Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9184-9189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 65Joseph S.K. Pierson S. Samanta S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and endoglycosidase H (66Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5673-5679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results establish that neither full-length IP3R nor fragments containing TMD5-6 progress to the medial Golgi. The extracellular domain of ICAM contains eight N-glycosylation sites (63Bella J. Rossman M.G. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ICAM migrated as two bands on SDS-PAGE. Most protein was in the higher molecular weight band, which was resistant to endoglycosidase H but sensitive to N-glycosidase F (Fig. 5, B and C). The upper band is the fully glycosylated protein that has passed through the medial Golgi, and the lower band, which was susceptible to both enzymes, is the core glycosylated protein.

In the present study, purified recombinant human envoplakin and periplakin were used to investigate their properties and interactions. We found that envoplakin was insoluble at physiological conditions in vitro, and co-assembly with periplakin was required for its solubility. Envoplakin and periplakin formed soluble complexes with equimolar stoichiometry. Chemical cross-linking revealed that the major soluble form of all periplakin constructs and of envoplakin/periplakin rod domains was a dimer, although co-assembly of the full-length proteins resulted in formation of higher order oligomers. Electron microscopy of rotary-shadowed periplakin demonstrated thin flexible molecules with an average contour length of 88 nm for the rod-plus-tail fragment, and immunolabeling EM confirmed the molecule as a parallel, in-register, dimer. Both periplakin and envoplakin/periplakin oligomers were able to bind synthetic lipid vesicles whose composition mimicked the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. This binding was dependent on anionic phospholipids and Ca2+. These findings raise the possibility that envoplakin and periplakin bind to the plasma membrane upon elevation of intracellular [Ca2+] in differentiating keratinocytes, where they serve as a scaffold for cornified cell envelope assembly.

Terminally differentiating stratified squamous epithelial cells assemble a specialized protective barrier structure at their periphery termed the cornified cell envelope (CE) 1The abbreviations used are: CE, cornified cell envelope; IF, intermediate filaments; SLV, synthetic lipid vesicles. 1The abbreviations used are: CE, cornified cell envelope; IF, intermediate filaments; SLV, synthetic lipid vesicles.

BioEssays. 2002; 24: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The CE replaces the plasma membrane and provides vital physical and permeability barrier properties to epithelial tissues in mammals. It consists of a 10-nm thick layer of transglutaminase cross-linked proteins. In the particular case of the epidermis, a 5-nm thick layer of ceramide lipids is covalently bound to the proteins (3Swartzendruber D.C. Wertz P.W. Madison K.C. Downing D.T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1987; 88: 709-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Envoplakin and periplakin have been proposed to provide a scaffolding on to which the CE is assembled (4Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A. Parry D.A. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1835-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).As early as 1984, Simon and Green (5Simon M. Green H. Cell. 1984; 36: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) identified two proteins with apparent molecular masses of 195 and 210 kDa that were incorporated into the keratinocyte CE upon activation of cellular transglutaminase. Later it was shown that the 195-kDa protein, mostly soluble in undifferentiated cells, becomes insoluble and submembranously located at the periphery of differentiated cells (6Ma A.S. Sun T.T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After the sequences of these CE precursors were identified, the proteins were named periplakin and envoplakin, respectively (4Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A. Parry D.A. Watt F.M. J.

Moreover, both envoplakin and periplakin were identified as CE lipid-attachment sites along with involucrin (11Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17763-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Their expression precedes the expression of other CE precursor proteins (4Ruhrberg C.

Envoplakin is expressed in the suprabasal layers of stratified squamous epithelia, but not in simple epithelia or nonepithelial cells (7Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A. Simon M. Dooley T.P. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 715-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Periplakin is expressed in a number of epithelial and nonepithelial tissues as well (4Ruhrberg C.

Dermatol. 2002; 11: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Both proteins are up-regulated during the terminal differentiation and partially colocalize with desmosomes in addition to decorating the intermediate filaments (IF) in differentiating keratinocytes (4Ruhrberg C.

The immature CEs of cultured keratinocytes contain a higher proportion of periplakin and envoplakin than do mature CE from skin (12Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4247-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, masking of their epitopes by deposition of loricrin on the cytoplasmic face of the CE at later stages of its assembly suggested an outermost location for periplakin and envoplakin, immediately adjacent to the surrounding layer of covalently attached lipids (12Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4247-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Together, these data led to the proposal that periplakin and envoplakin, along with involucrin, initiate the CE assembly, providing sites for attachment of reinforcement proteins (loricrin, small proline-rich proteins and others) from one side and CE-specific lipids from the opposite side (12Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4247-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Envoplakin and periplakin are members of the plakin family (18Fuchs E. Karakesisoglou I.

Formation of dimers by desmoplakin (28O'Keefe E.J. Erickson H.P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8310-8318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and tetramers by plectin (27Foisner R. Wiche G. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 515-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) has been reported. Based on theoretical calculations, envoplakin and periplakin were predicted to be the only family members able to form heterodimers with each other, and their coimmunoprecipitation under stringent buffer conditions provided support for this idea (4Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A. Parry D.A. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1835-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Later, in transfection studies it was found that envoplakin accumulated in nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates but redistributed to desmosomes and the IF upon introduction of periplakin into the cells (16DiColandrea T. Karashima T. Määttä A. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because both proteins can be found decorating the IF network, envoplakin and periplakin were proposed to connect the IF to the CE, conferring mechanical integrity to a cornified cell (4Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A. Parry D.A. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1835-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 7Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A. Simon M. Dooley T.P. Watt F.M. J.

In this paper, we report the oligomerization state, conformation, and ultrastructure of periplakin and envoplakin/periplakin molecules, and their binding properties to synthetic lipid vesicles (SLV).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of cDNA Constructs—Full-length or fragments (Fig. 1) of human envoplakin and periplakin cDNAs were cloned using pairs of primers (Table I) with NdeI and HindIII sites in forward and reverse primers, respectively. First strand cDNA was synthesized with the ThermoScript RT-PCR System (Invitrogen) using as a template total RNA isolated from a normal human keratinocyte cell culture, grown for 1 day after induction of terminal differentiation by 1.2 mm calcium. The reaction was carried out for 60 min at 58 °C with E6 or P6 envoplakin or periplakin gene-specific primers, respectively. Target DNA was amplified by PCR using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR Kit (Roche Applied Science) in 35 cycles with specific primer pairs (Fig. 1). The products were cloned into the pET-23a(+) expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) with vector-encoded C-terminal His6 tag fusion, and expressed in the Epicurian Coli BL21-Codon Plus(DE3)-RIL strain of Escherichia coli (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).Table IPrimers usedPrimerSequenceE15′-TACGCATATGTTCAAGGGGCTGAGCAAAGG-3′E25′-GCAGCATATGGAGAGCCCTGCCCAAGCAG-3′E35′-GAGCCATATGGAGCTCAGCCAGGAGACCC-3′E45′-GCTGAAGCTTCAGGGCCTCTGACTCTCTCC-3′E55′-TGGAAAGCTTGGTGGAAAGGTTGGTCTCTCG-3′E65′-CCCAAGCTTGCGAAGGGAGCGCGGGAC-3′P15′-CGCCCATATGAACTCGCTCTTCAGGAAGAGAAAC-3′P25′-GGTGCATATGAAGGTGCCGGATCCCGTG-3′P35′-CGAGCATATGAAGCGCCTGGGCTCCG-3′P45′-GCTGAAGCTTCTCCTCCAGCACGGGATCC-3′P55′-GCTCAAGCTTGACGGCCACGGAGC-3′P65′-GTGCAAGCTTCTGCCCAGATACCAAGACCG-3′ Open table in a new tab Protein Purification—Bacterial cultures were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Recombinant protein expression was induced in mid-log phase at A600 = 0.6-0.7 by 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Soluble proteins Et, Pt, and Ph were extracted from pelleted bacteria with B-PER Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce) supplemented with 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The other recombinant proteins were solubilized from inclusion bodies with 500 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, 5 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. His-tagged proteins were purified using a nickel-chelated Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) followed by anion-exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length envoplakin and its rod-containing fragments Er and Ert were further purified by preparative SDS-PAGE, freed of SDS by ion-pair extraction (31Konigsberg W.H. Henderson L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and re-dissolved in assembly buffer (see below) containing 6 m urea immediately prior to use. For production of radioactively labeled proteins, bacteria were grown in M9 minimal medium (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and [35S]methionine or [3H]leucine were added to 10 μCi/ml simultaneously with the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce).Circular Dichroism (CD) Measurements—Spectra of purified proteins at 0.1 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.5 were measured using a Jasco J-715 spectrometer calibrated with a solution of ammonium (-)-10-camphorsulfonate. The spectra were scanned at 50 nm/min, digitized, and recorded at 0.5-nm intervals. All spectra were measured at room temperature using a 0.1-cm path length cuvette and averaged over 4 individual scans. The data were analyzed using CONTIN-CD software (33Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar).Protein Assembly in Vitro—Envoplakin, periplakin, or their mixtures at 1 mg/ml in 6 m urea, 25 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.8, were diluted 20-fold with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA in 25 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.8 (Assembly buffer), and incubated at room temperature for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 175,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4-12 or 4-20% Tris glycine gels (Invitrogen). Supernatants were analyzed on 4-12% Tris glycine gels under non-denaturing conditions as well. When complexes were assembled from 35S-labeled envoplakin and 3H-labeled periplakin, protein bands were cut out the Coomassie Blue-stained gels and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide at 60 °C overnight followed by addition of 10 ml of CytoScint liquid scintillation mixture (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). 35S and 3H radioactivity were counted separately using a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).Cross-linking Experiments—Protein solutions at 50 μg/ml in 6 m urea, 25 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.8, were dialyzed against the same buffer of desired urea concentration and cross-linked with 2 mm bis[2-sulfosuccinimidooxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone (Sulfo-BSOCOES) (Pierce) on ice for 2 h. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4-12 or 4-20% Tris glycine gels.Electron Microscopy—For rotary shadowing, 20-μl aliquots of protein at 50 μg/ml in 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.8, were mixed with 40 μl of glycerol and sprayed on to freshly cleaved mica (34Tyler J.M. Branton D. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 71: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The mica was placed on the rotary table of a RMC freeze-fracture unit (Boeckeler Instruments, Tucson, AZ) and pumped to ∼2 × 10-5 pascal. The samples were rotary shadowed at room temperature with platinum/carbon at an angle of 6° and coated with carbon at 90°. The replicas were floated off on deionized water, picked up on copper grids, observed with a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope (Peabody, MA) operated at 80 kV, and photographed at a magnification of 50,000. The negatives were digitized with a Microtek ScanMaker 8700 scanner at a resolution of 1200 dpi. Digitized micrographs were processed using Adobe Photoshop version 5.5. Contour length measurements were done with Image J version 1.30. 2Available at rsb.info.nih.gov/ij. Anti-periplakin Antibodies—The polyclonal chicken antibodies were produced by Aves Labs, Inc. (Tigard, OR). Purified recombinant tail domain of periplakin (periplakin amino acids 1638-1756) without His tag was used for immunization. The antibodies were affinity purified on HiTrap NHS HP column (Amersham Biosciences) with the antigen coupled.Preparation of SLV—Individual lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) were dissolved and mixed in chloroform/methanol (9:1). Lipid composition was 25 mol % of cholesterol, 60 mol % of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, and 15 mol % of anionic phospholipid: dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine or dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylglycerol, or dipalmitoyl-phosphatidic acid or bovine liver phosphatidylinositol. When anionic phospholipids were omitted, phosphatidylcholine content was 75 mol %.Lipid mixtures were dried under nitrogen followed by high vacuum for 4 h, and hydrated in 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm NaN3, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, by shaking at 60 °C for 30 min. Large, unilamellar vesicles with a nominal mean diameter of 250 nm were prepared by extrusion through a 200-nm polycarbonate membrane in the Avanti Mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) at 60 °C. SLV were diluted with an equal volume of the above buffer without sucrose, spun down at 175,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman airfuge (Beckman Coulter), and resuspended in the latter buffer to a final concentration of 20 μmol of lipids/ml. Phospholipid concentrations were measured by phosphorus content (35Gerlach E. Deuticke B. Biochem. Z. 1963; 337: 477-479PubMed Google Scholar).Assaying Membrane Association of Envoplakin and Periplakin—Typically, 20-μl reaction mixtures contained 1 μg of protein and varying amounts of SLV (15-150 nmol of lipids) in 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, with a range of CaCl2 concentrations. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and centrifuged at 175,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants (non-bound protein) and pellets (SLV-bound protein) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on Tris glycine gels. To determine the binding capacity of liposomes, the amount of protein in the pellets was quantitated by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels.RESULTSCo-assembly with Periplakin Is Required for Proper Folding of Envoplakin—cDNAs encoding the full-length proteins or their separate domains (Fig. 1) were cloned into bacterial expression vectors. When expressed, most of these proteins, with the exception of Ph, Et, and Pt constructs, were insoluble in bacterial cells and accumulated in inclusion bodies. Experiments with several commercially available bacterial strains specifically adapted for recombinant protein expression and with different temperature regimens did not yield detectable levels of soluble protein. Nevertheless, all periplakin constructs and envoplakin head domain could be successfully refolded from urea solutions by step dialysis against buffers with progressively decreasing urea concentrations upon completion of purification in urea-containing buffers. Their folding is evidenced by the fairly good agreement of circular dichroism measurements of secondary structure content with predictions, both yielding a high content of α-helix (Table II). Whereas rod domain-containing periplakin constructs remained soluble upon diluting out the urea (Fig. 2, panels Pr, Prt, and P), full-length envoplakin or its rod-containing fragments precipitated when the urea concentration was lowered below 1 m (Fig. 2, panels Er, Ert, and E). However, if envoplakin was first mixed with periplakin in 6 m urea, it remained soluble after dilution of urea (Fig. 2, panels Er + Pr, Ert + Prt, and E + P; Table II). The periplakin rod domain alone was sufficient to rescue full-length envoplakin from aggregation (Fig. 2, panel E + Pr).Table IISecondary structure of envoplakin and periplakin domainsProtein domainα-Helix contentPredicted by “GOR IV”Measured (best fit)%EnvoplakinEh6490-100 (100)Et4336-39 (39)PeriplakinPh6879-90 (86)Pr8783-100 (94)Pt4314-38 (25)ComplexEr/Pr82/87aFor each protein separately.50-100 (100)a For each protein separately. Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Periplakin rescues envoplakin from aggregation. Individual proteins at 1 mg/ml or their equimolar mixture in 6 m urea, 25 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8, were diluted 20-fold by 25 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA in a centrifuge tube and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged at 175,000 × g for 30 min and supernatants (s) and pellets (p) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4-12% gradient gels stained with Coomassie Blue. Note that all envoplakin constructs are found in the pellet fractions when periplakin is not present (panels Er, Ert, and E), but shift to the supernatant when co-assembled with periplakin (panels Er + Pr, Ert + Prt, E + P, and E + Pr).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Periplakin and Envoplakin Form Hetero-oligomers at a 1:1 Ratio—When envoplakin and periplakin were refolded together in equimolar amounts and the resulting soluble fraction was analyzed by non-denaturing gels, no bands of periplakin homo-oligomers were detected, but a band of envoplakin/periplakin hetero-oligomer appeared (Fig. 3A, compare lanes M, M′, and M″ to lanes Pr, Prt, and P). Note the absence of any soluble protein when attempts were made to refold envoplakin by itself (Fig. 3A, lanes Er, Ert, and E), and the appearance of high molecular weight soluble complexes at the bottom of gel wells in the case of full-length periplakin and its mixture with envoplakin (Fig. 3A, lanes P and M″). To prove that the major product of envoplakin and periplakin co-assembly was their hetero-oligomer and to determine its stoichiometry, assembly experiments were performed with 35S-labeled envoplakin and 3H-labeled periplakin. Protein bands were cut out of the Coomassie Blue-stained non-denaturing gels and 35S and 3H radioactivity were counted separately. The bands marked as Er/Pr in Fig. 3B contained both 35S and 3H radioactivity. When the proteins were mixed at an equimolar ratio, the major band contained equal amounts of envoplakin and periplakin (Fig. 3B). When either protein was present in up to 3-fold excess, the soluble material was near-equimolar with only a slight excess of either 35S or 3H radioactivity (see “Discussion”). Accordingly, these data suggest that the two proteins are present in equimolar amounts in heteromeric complexes.Fig. 3Periplakin and envoplakin form hetero-oligomers. Proteins were refolded from urea solutions as described in the legend for Fig. 2, centrifuged at 175,000 × g for 30 min, and supernatants were analyzed by PAGE under non-denaturing conditions. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. M, M′, and M″ denote lines with equimolar mixtures of non-labeled proteins (A). B, [35S]envoplakin and [3H]periplakin (both of specific activity 250 dpm/pmol) were mixed in a range of molar ratios indicated on the top. Mixtures contained at least 2,500 disintegrations/min of each protein. Protein bands were cut out of the Coomassie Blue-stained gels and 35S and 3H radioactivity were counted separately using a scintillation counter. [35S] to [3H] ratios in envoplakin/periplakin hetero-oligomer are indicated at the bottom. Protein band assignments are shown at the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Periplakin Forms Heterodimers and Higher Order Complexes with Envoplakin That Are as Stable as Periplakin Dimers—To determine the numbers of polypeptide chains in periplakin homo-oligomers and periplakin/envoplakin hetero-oligomers, chemical cross-linking was performed with the bifunctional reagent bis[2-sulfosuccinimidooxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone. Cross-linking of full-length periplakin and envoplakin resulted in two major products: a band with apparent mobility of about 850 kDa and a large complex that was unable to enter the gel and stayed in the loading well (Fig. 4A, left panel). Both cross-linking products were soluble as judged by ultracentrifugation (Fig. 4A, right panel). Absence of any intermediate between monomers and the 850-kDa band even at the shortest time of cross-linking led us to believe that this band is a dimer.Fig. 4Examination of periplakin and the envoplakin/periplakin oligomeric state by chemical cross-linking.A, a mixture of full-length envoplakin and periplakin at 50 μg/ml each in 6 m urea, 25 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8, was dialyzed against the same buffer without urea, cleared by ultracentrifugation, and the soluble fraction was cross-linked with 1 mm Sulfo-BSOCOES on ice. Aliquots were withdrawn after 1, 5, or 30 min after addition of the cross-linker and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (left panel). An aliquot taken after 30 min incubation was centrifuged at 175,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant (s) and pellet (p) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (right panel). Note that all cross-linked protein is found in the supernatant. The positions of rabbit muscle myosin (200"

The limiting rate constants of reactive center loop insertion (klim) and concentrations of proteinase at half-saturation (K0.5) for tPA and uPA and the specificity constants (klim/K0.5) for elastase were determined. The pH dependences of klim/K0.5 reflected inactivation of each enzyme due to protonation of His57 of the catalytic triad. However, the specificity of the inhibitory reaction with tPA and uPA was notably higher than that for the substrate reaction catalyzed by elastase. pH dependences of klim and K0.5 obtained for tPA revealed an additional ionizable group (pKa, 6.0–6.2) affecting the reaction. Protonation of this group resulted in a significant increase in both klim and K0.5 and a 4.6-fold decrease in the specificity of the reaction of tPA with NBD P9 PAI-1. Binding of monoclonal antibody MA-55F4C12 to PAI-1 induced a decrease in klim and K0.5 at any pH but did not affect either the pKa of the group or an observed decrease in klim/K0.5 due to protonation of the group. In contrast to tPA, the klim and K0.5 for the reactions of uPA with NBD P9 PAI-1 or its complex with the monoclonal antibody were independent of pH in the 6.5–8.5 range. Since slightly acidic pH is a feature of a number of malignant tumors, alterations in PAI-1/tPA kinetics could play a role in the cancerogenesis. Changes in the protonation state of His188, which is placed closely to the S1 site and is unique for tPA, has been proposed to contribute to the observed pH dependences of klim and K0.5.

PAI-1 is a major endogenous regulator of tissue-type (EC 3.4.21.68) (tPA) and urokinase-type (EC 3.4.21.73) (uPA) plasminogen activators (2van Mourik J.A. Lawrence D.A. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14914-14921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both uPA and tPA cleave the zymogen plasminogen, producing active serine proteinase plasmin, which participates in fibrin degradation. As a result, PAI-1 plays an important role in the control of normal fibrinolysis (26Carrell R.W. Evans D.L. Stein P.E.

High levels of PAI-1, which prevent formation of plasmin and result in thrombosis, are associated with the development of ischemic arterial disease and deep vein thrombosis. It has been proposed that PAI-1 contributes to malignant tumor growth as an effective regulator of angiogenesis. However, inconsistencies in the reports (33Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S.

Recent studies of the effect of PAI-1 on choroidal pathologic vascularization (39Lambert V. Munaut C. Noel A. Frankenne F. Bajou K. Gerard R. Carmeliet P. Defresne M.P. Foidart J.M. Rakic J.M.

Therefore, understanding of this mechanism would be beneficial for the development of new therapeutic compounds for controlling pathologic angiogenesis (41McMahon G.A. Petitclerc E. Stefansson S.

One of the possible reasons for alterations in PAI-1 reaction could be a difference in the composition or physicochemical properties of the extracellular fluid between normal and malignant tissues. It has been found that tumors are often characterized by an acidic extracellular microenvironment that can be 0.5–1.0 pH unit lower than the pH of the normal tissue and blood (42Ashby B.S. Lancet. 1966; 2: 312-315Abstract PubMed Google Scholar, 43Helmlinger G. Yuan F. Dellian M. Jain R.K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 44Helmlinger G. Sckell A.

To the best of our knowledge there are no data available on the pH dependence of the kinetics of PAI-1 inhibitory reaction. To address this question, we studied pH dependences of the reaction of PAI-1 with its target proteinases (tPA and uPA) and with human pancreatic elastase. In the present study, the S338C mutant variant of PAI-1 with NBD group attached to the sulfhydryl group of cysteine (NBD P9 PAI-1) has been used to examine the kinetics of the insertion of cleaved RCL at different pH values. The pH dependences of limiting rates of RCL insertion for reactions of tPA and uPA with NBD P9 PAI-1 and its complex with monoclonal antibody (mAb) MA-55F4C12 have been determined. Obtained data revealed the features contributing to the PAI-1/proteinase recognition and the nature of the functional groups involved. A single residue, unique for PAI-1/tPA (most likely a histidine in the proteinase), is proposed to control changes in the limiting rate of RCL insertion at the physiological pH range. Proteins and Reagents—Analytical grade buffer reagents and pancreatic elastase were purchased from Sigma. The S338C (P9 Cys) PAI-1 was labeled with NBD group as described previously (45Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The concentration of NBD P9 PAI-1 and incorporation of the NBD group were determined from absorbances at 280 and 480 nm, respectively (45Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Activity of NBD P9 PAI-1 was determined by titration of the inhibitor with uPA or tPA. Concentrations of wild type PAI-1 were calculated from absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient (∈280) of 0.93 ml mg–1 cm–1 and Mr of 43,000 (46Vaughan D.E. Declerck P.J. Reilly T.M. Park K. Collen D. Fasman G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Human recombinant tPA (Activase) was obtained from Genentech, South San Francisco, CA. Single chain tPA was converted to the two-chain form by treatment with immobilized plasmin as described previously (47Kvassman J.O. Shore J.D. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 215-221Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Human recombinant uPA was a gift from Abbott Laboratories. The concentrations of tPA and uPA were calculated from absorbance values at 280 nm using Mr values of 63,500 and 54,000 and ∈280 values of 1.90 and 1.36 ml mg–1 cm–1, respectively. Mouse mAb MA-55F4C12 was selected from the panel raised against the human PAI-1·tPA complex (48Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Antibody concentration was determined spectrophotometrically from the absorbance at 280 nm using Mr of 150,000 and ∈280 of 1.3 ml mg–1 cm–1. All experiments were performed using 50 mm phosphate buffer prepared by mixing solutions of 50 mm KH2PO4 with 50 mm K2HPO4. Due to a low solubility of tPA at low pH, the range of the measurements was limited by pH 5.5. Measurements of the Rates of RCL Insertion—NBD P9 PAI-1, which behaves similarly to the wild type PAI-1, has been used previously to study the mechanisms of spontaneous and mAb-assisted inactivation of PAI-1 as well as the interaction of PAI-1 and its mAb complexes with proteinases (22Lawrence D.A.

Changes in the environment of the NBD group, due to its removal from contact with solution and the burial of the RCL into the β-sheet A, resulted in a significant increase in the intensity of the NBD fluorescence emission (45Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Time-dependent inactivation of NBD P9 PAI-1 or its complex with MA-55F4C12 by tPA and uPA was measured by incubating various concentrations of proteinase (0–5 μm) with 20–40 nm inhibitor. A microvolume stopped-flow reaction analyzer (model SX-18MV, Applied Photophysics Ltd.) equipped with a fluorescence detector and a thermostated cell was used to monitor the changes in fluorescence of NBD P9 PAI-1 on its reaction with proteinases. The excitation wavelength was set at 480 nm, and the progress of the reaction was monitored by measuring the increase in NBD fluorescence emission through a 500 nm cut-off filter. Pseudo-first-order ([proteinase] > 5 [NBD P9 PAI-1]) rate constants (kobs) were obtained directly from the stopped-flow traces by fitting observed changes in fluorescence emission to a single exponential process Ft = A + B (1 – e–(kobs)t). Effect of pH on Kinetic Parameters of NBD P9 PAI-1/Proteinase Reaction—The values of kobs were measured at different proteinase concentrations and at varying pH ranges of 5.5–8.5. Plots of kobs (average of four to six measurements) versus proteinase concentration, obtained for tPA and uPA, were fitted to the hyperbolic equation kobs = klim × [E]/(K0.5 + [E]) where klim is the limiting rate constant of RCL insertion at infinite concentration of proteinase, and K0.5 represents the proteinase concentration at half-saturation. This equation describes the scheme of the interaction of proteinase with NBD PAI-1, which includes formation of the Michaelis-like complex between NBD P9 PAI-1 and proteinase followed by the RCL insertion. Dependences of the rate of RCL insertion on concentration of elastase did not demonstrate saturation within the range of pH used; therefore, the values of specificity constant (klim/K0.5) for elastase were calculated from the slopes of linear dependences of kobs versus proteinase concentration. Data Analysis and Calculation of pKa—The values of specificity constant obtained for tPA, uPA, and elastase at pH ranging from 5.5 to 8.5 were plotted as log(klim/K0.5) versus pH and were fitted to the equation: klim/K0.5 = (klim/K0.5)lim/(1 + 10pKa – pH)) (53Leskovac V. Comprehensive Enzyme Kinetics. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2003: 283-315Google Scholar) where (klim/K0.5)lim represents the plateau value of klim/K0.5, and Ka represents the ionization constant of the catalytically important residue(s). This equation corresponds to a model in which transition of proteinase from the active to the inactive conformation occurs as a result of protonation of a single residue. The pH dependences for klim for reactions of NBD P9 PAI-1 and its complex with MA-55F4C12 with tPA were fitted to the equation, which suggests that tPA is active in both protonated and deprotonated forms. klim = (klimA 10(–pH) + klimB 10(–pKa))/(10(–pH) + 10(–pKa)) (53Leskovac V. Comprehensive Enzyme Kinetics. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2003: 283-315Google Scholar) where klimA and klimB represent the limiting rates of RCL insertion of the species with protonated and deprotonated group, respectively. The pH dependences for klim for reactions of NBD P9 PAI-1 and its complex with MA-55F4C12 with uPA were fitted to the equation klim = klimB/(1 + 10(pKa – pH)) (53Leskovac V. Comprehensive Enzyme Kinetics. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2003: 283-315Google Scholar), suggesting inactivation of the uPA due to protonation of the single group. Changes in Specificity of the Reaction with PAI-1—The rate constant for the reaction of a free PAI-1 with a free proteinase equals klim/K0.5. Therefore, at similar conditions, the ratio ((klimtPA/K0.5tPA)/(klimuPA/K0.5uPA)) reflects the relative specificity of the reaction of the target proteinases with PAI-1. To determine differences in the Gibbs free energy between tPA and uPA or elastase, the values of ΔΔG0 were calculated as –RT ln(klimtPA/K0.5tPA)/(klimE/K0.5E) where E is either uPA or elastase, T is the absolute temperature, and R is a gas constant. Effect of pH on the Formation of the Initial PAI-1·Proteinase Complex—The displacement of p-aminobenzamidine (PAB) (54Evans S.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 14891-14895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been used to determine the effect of pH on binding of tPA and uPA to PAI-1. PAB·proteinase complexes were preformed by incubating uPA (0.08–0.16 μm) or tPA (0.15 μm) with PAB (100 and 180–400 μm, respectively) for 10 min at 25 °C at different pH values. PAI-1 (0–5.0 μm) was mixed with proteinase·PAB complex using the SX-18MV (excitation wavelengths were 320 and 330 nm for uPA and tPA, respectively). Progress of the reaction was monitored by following a decreasing fluorescent emission detected through a 335 nm cut-off filter. Data were fitted to a single exponential equation: Ft = A + B e–(k tobs)t where Ft is the fluorescence at time t, A is an offset, B is the amplitude, and kobs is the pseudo-first-order rate constant. The rates of formation of the PAI-1·proteinase complexes (k1) were calculated from the slopes of dependences of the kobs on PAI-1 concentration as described earlier. The pH dependences of log k1 for tPA and uPA were fitted to the equation k1 = klim/(1 + 10(pKa – pH)) where klim11 is the maximal value of k1, and Ka represents the ionization constant of the residue controlling the initial complex formation. Effect of pH on the Specificity of the Reaction of NBD P9 PAI-1 with tPA, uPA, and Elastase—tPA and uPA, the physiological targets of PAI-1, were used to study the effects of pH on the rate of RCL insertion due to the inhibitory reaction with NBD P9 PAI-1. In contrast to tPA and uPA, human pancreatic elastase cleaves the P3P4 peptide bond of PAI-1 and does not form a PAI-1/proteinase inhibitory complex (57Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, upon cleavage by elastase, RCL is inserted into the β-sheet A of PAI-1 in a fashion similar to that for the inhibitory complex (57Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction with elastase follows the substrate branch of the PAI-1 mechanism and does not include either the translocation of the proteinase or the distortion of its active site. Thus, the RCL insertion due to the reaction with elastase was selected as a control to distinguish mechanistic features that are common to all three proteinases. The values of the specificity constant (klim/K0.5), where klim is the maximal rate of RCL insertion, and K0.5 is the concentration of the proteinase when RCL insertion occurs at half-klim, were calculated from the slopes of linear ([proteinase] « K0.5) dependences of the observed rate constant (kobs) of the RCL insertion on the enzyme concentration. Values of kobs were measured directly from the increase in the fluorescence emission of the NBD group due to RCL insertion as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For all three enzymes, the specificity constants increased significantly from pH 5.5 to 6.5 followed by a plateau (Fig. 1). The pH dependences observed for the pH interval 5.5–8.5 (Fig. 1) fitted well to the model, which includes two types of proteinase molecules, inactive protonated and active deprotonated species, with a specificity constant equal to that from the plateau value for each proteinase. The limiting value of klim/K0.5 ((klim/K0.5)lim) for the reaction with elastase (0.12 μm–1 s–1) was almost 2 orders of magnitude lower than that for the inhibitory reaction with uPA and was 400 times less than (klim/K0.5)lim for tPA (Table I). The changes in Gibbs free energy calculated from the relative specificity of tPA/uPA, uPA/elastase, and tPA/elastase pairs (Table I) demonstrated that the inhibitory reactions of PAI-1 with tPA and uPA are thermodynamically more beneficial than the substrate reaction with elastase by –3.6 and –2.6 kcal/mol, respectively. The values of pKa estimated from pH dependences of klim/K0.5 for tPA, uPA, and elastase were within the range 6.1–6.4 (Table I). Thus, deprotonation of the group (probably an imidazole ring of a histidine residue), with pKa of 6.0–6.5, is required for maximal efficiency of the RCL insertion. Linear regression analysis of the data points from the acidic portion of curves yielded slopes of 1.1 ± 0.2 for uPA and elastase, suggesting that a single residue is responsible for the observed pH dependences. These results support the conclusion that a decrease in the klim/K0.5 at pH below 6.0 most likely reflects protonation of the catalytic His57, which is a conserved residue in serine proteinases. However, the slope for the linear part of the pH dependence of tPA was close to 2.0 (Table I), indicating protonation of another group apart from the His57. To gain further insight into the basis of the different pH dependences for tPA and uPA, the values of klim and K0.5 for the reaction of NBD P9 PAI-1 with each target proteinase were determined at pH ranging from 6.0 to 8.5.Table IKinetic parameters for the reaction of NBD P9 PAI-1 with proteinases calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures” from the pH dependences of klim/K0.5Enzyme(klim/K0.5)maxpKaSlopeaEstimated from the linear part of the pH dependences.ΔΔG0m-1 s-1 × 10-6kcal/molbCalculated as ΔΔG0=−RTIn(klimtPA/K0.5tPA)max/(klimE/K0.5E)max, where T is the absolute temperature, R is gas constant, and E is either uPA or elastase.tPA48.4 ± 4.06.4 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.2uPA9.3 ± 1.06.1 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.2-1.0Elastase0.12 ± 0.026.2 ± 0.41.1 ± 0.2-3.6a Estimated from the linear part of the pH dependences.b Calculated as ΔΔG0=−RTIn(klimtPA/K0.5tPA)max/(klimE/K0.5E)max, where T is the absolute temperature, R is gas constant, and E is either uPA or elastase.
