https://openalex.org/W2989530049,"Systematic scientometric reviews, empowered by computational and visual analytic approaches, offer opportunities to improve the timeliness, accessibility, and reproducibility of studies of the literature of a field of research. On the other hand, effectively and adequately identifying the most representative body of scholarly publications as the basis of subsequent analyses remains a common bottleneck in the current practice. What can we do to reduce the risk of missing something potentially significant? How can we compare different search strategies in terms of the relevance and specificity of topical areas covered? In this study, we introduce a flexible and generic methodology based on a significant extension of the general conceptual framework of citation indexing for delineating the literature of a research field. The method, through cascading citation expansion, provides a practical connection between studies of science from local and global perspectives. We demonstrate an application of the methodology to the research of literature-based discovery (LBD) and compare five datasets constructed based on three use scenarios and corresponding retrieval strategies, namely a query-based lexical search (one dataset), forward expansions starting from a groundbreaking article of LBD (two datasets), and backward expansions starting from a recently published review article by a prominent expert in LBD (two datasets). We particularly discuss the relevance of areas captured by expansion processes with reference to the query-based scientometric visualization. The method used in this study for comparing bibliometric datasets is applicable to comparative studies of search strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2981981976,"Chronic stress (CS) is a major risk factor for the development of depression. Here, we demonstrate that CS-induced hyperactivity in ventral tegmental area (VTA)-projecting lateral habenula (LHb) neurons is associated with increased passive coping (PC), but not anxiety or anhedonia. LHb→VTA neurons in mice with increased PC show increased burst and tonic firing as well as synaptic adaptations in excitatory inputs from the entopeduncular nucleus (EP). In vivo manipulations of EP→LHb or LHb→VTA neurons selectively alter PC and effort-related motivation. Conversely, dorsal raphe (DR)-projecting LHb neurons do not show CS-induced hyperactivity and are targeted indirectly by the EP. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we reveal a set of genes that can collectively serve as biomarkers to identify mice with increased PC and differentiate LHb→VTA from LHb→DR neurons. Together, we provide a set of biological markers at the level of genes, synapses, cells, and circuits that define a distinctive CS-induced behavioral phenotype."

The mechanism of this deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) is poorly understood. Poludnenko et al. developed an analytical model to describe DDTs, then tested it with lab experiments and numerical simulations. Their model successfully reproduced the DDT seen in the experiments and predicted a DDT in type Ia supernovae, which is consistent with observational constraints. The same mechanism may apply to DDTs in any unconfined explosion. Science , this issue p. eaau7365"
https://openalex.org/W2985098807,"The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in health and disease and produces, through fermentative reactions, several metabolic products, such as lactate, that can affect the host. The microbiota also interacts with and metabolizes compounds produced by the host, such as primary bile acids. Lactate and bile acids (BA) are of particular interest in gastrointestinal diseases because they have been associated with metabolic acidosis and bile acid diarrhea, respectively. The objectives of this study were to validate an enzymatic assay to quantify D-, L-, and total lactate in canine feces, and to characterize fecal lactate and BA concentrations as well as bacterial abundances in healthy dogs and dogs with gastrointestinal diseases. Fecal samples were collected from 34 healthy dogs, 15 dogs with chronic enteropathy (CE), and 36 dogs with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Lactate was quantified with an enzymatic assay, BA with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 11 bacterial groups with qPCR. A fecal lactate reference interval was established from 34 healthy dogs and was 0.7–1.4 mM, 0.3–6.0 mM, and 1.0–7.0 mM for D-, L-, and total lactate, respectively. The assay to measure D-, L-, and total lactate in canine fecal samples was linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible. Significant increases in fecal lactate and decreases in secondary BA concentrations were observed in dogs with CE and dogs with EPI. Dogs with EPI had an increased abundance of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium; a decreased abundance of Fusobacterium and Clostridium hiranonis; and a higher Dysbiosis Index when compared to healthy dogs. Further studies are necessary to determine the clinical utility of lactate and BA quantification in canine feces. These metabolites suggest functional alterations of intestinal dysbiosis and may become promising targets for further elucidating the role of the microbiota in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2983600939,"The family of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) contains several species of major public health relevance due to their role as vectors of human disease. One of these species, Aedes aegypti, is responsible for the transmission of some of the most important vector-borne viruses affecting humankind, including dengue fever, chikungunya and Zika. Traditionally, control of Ae. aegypti and other arthropod species has relied on the use of a relatively small diversity of chemical insecticides. However, widespread and intensive use of these substances has caused significant adverse environmental effects and has contributed to the appearance of pesticide-resistant populations in an increasing number of locations around the world, thereby dramatically reducing their efficiency. Therefore, it becomes urgent to develop novel alternative tools for vector control. In that context, our study aimed at evaluating the insecticidal activity against Ae. aegypti of aqueous extracts obtained from the fruits of Solanum mammosum L., as well as silver nanoparticles synthesized using aqueous extracts from this plant species (SmAgNPs). To perform the test, third instar Ae. aegypti larvae were exposed to increasing concentrations of plant extract and SmAgNPs for 24 h. Our results suggest that both the aqueous extract and SmAgNPs were toxic to the larvae, with SmAgNPs displaying a much higher level of toxicity than the extract alone, as reflected in their LC50 values (0.06 ppm vs 1631.27 ppm, respectively). These results suggest that both S. mammosum extracts and SmAgNPs exhibit noteworthy larvicidal activity, and should be further explored as potential source of alternative tools in the fight against insect vectors of human disease."

This study aimed to develop and validate deep-learning-based risk stratification for the mortality of patients with AMI (DAMI). Methods The data of 22,875 AMI patients from the Korean working group of the myocardial infarction (KorMI) registry were exclusively divided into 12,152 derivation data of 36 hospitals and 10,723 validation data of 23 hospitals. The predictor variables were the initial demographic and laboratory data. The endpoints were in-hospital mortality and 12-months mortality. We compared the DAMI performance with the global registry of acute coronary event (GRACE) score, acute coronary treatment and intervention outcomes network (ACTION) score, and the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) score using the validation data. Results In-hospital mortality for the study subjects was 4.4% and 6-month mortality after survival upon discharge was 2.2%. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the DAMI were 0.905 [95% confidence interval 0.902–0.909] and 0.870 [0.865–0.876] for the ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients, respectively; these results significantly outperformed those of the GRACE (0.851 [0.846–0.856], 0.810 [0.803–0.819]), ACTION (0.852 [0.847–0.857], 0.806 [0.799–0.814] and TIMI score (0.781 [0.775–0.787], 0.593[0.585–0.603]). DAMI predicted 30.9% of patients more accurately than the GRACE score. As secondary outcome, during the 6-month follow-up, the high risk group, defined by the DAMI, has a significantly higher mortality rate than the low risk group (17.1% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001). Conclusions The DAMI predicted in-hospital mortality and 12-month mortality of AMI patients more accurately than the existing risk scores and other machine-learning methods."
https://openalex.org/W2987054543,"Introduction Mental health disorders in pregnant women living with HIV are associated with poor maternal and child outcomes, and undermine the global goals of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). This study aimed to determine prevalence of depression and anxiety and identify factors associated with these common mental health disorders among HIV-infeced pregnant women in Tanzania. Methods We enrolled 200 pregnant women living with HIV from antenatal care clinics in the Kilimanjaro region. Women were eligible if they were in the second or third trimester of pregnancy and had been in PMTCT care for a minimum of one month. Data were collected via interviewer administered surveys. Participants self reported depression symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, EPDS) and anxiety symptoms (Brief Symptom Index, BSI). Multivariate logistic regression models examined factors associated with depression, anxiety, and comorbid depression and anxiety. Results 25.0% of women met screening criteria for depression (EPDS ≥10). Depression was significantly associated with being single (aOR = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.1–15.5), food insecurity (aOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.0–6.4), and HIV shame (aOR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.1–1.3). 23.5% of participants met screening criteria for anxiety (BSI ≥1.01). Anxiety was associated with being single (aOR = 3.6, 95%CI = 1.1–11.1), HIV shame (aOR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.1–1.2) and lifetime experience of violence (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.0–5.1). 17.8% of the sample met screening criteria for both depression and anxiety. Comorbid depression and anxiety was associated with being single (aOR = 4.5, 95%CI = 1.0–19.1), HIV shame (aOR = 1.2, 95%CI = 1.1–1.3) and lifetime experience of violence (aOR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.2–9.6). Conclusion Depression and anxiety symptomatology was common in this sample of pregnant women living with HIV, with a sizable number screening positive for comorbid depression and anxiety. In order to successfully engage women in PMTCT care and support their well-being, strategies to screen for mental health disorders and support women with mental illnesses are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2984675434,"Primary postpartum hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Ethiopia has made significant progress in maternal health care services. Despite this, primary postpartum hemorrhage continues to remain the leading cause of maternal mortality in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of primary postpartum hemorrhage among mothers who gave birth at selected hospitals in the Southern Ethiopia.An institution-based cross-sectional study was employed from March 2-28, 2018. Four hundred and twenty-two study participants were obtained using the consecutive sampling method. A structured interviewer-administered questionnaire and chart review were used to collect data. Data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 22. Multivariable logistic regression were used to determine the predictors of primary postpartum hemorrhage with 95% CI and p-value < 0.05.The overall prevalence of primary postpartum hemorrhage was 16.6%. Mothers aged 35 and above [AOR = 6.8, 95% CI (3.6, 16.0)], pre-partum anemia [AOR = 5.3, 95% CI (2.2, 12.8)], complications during labor [AOR = 1.8, 95% CI (2.8, 4.2)], history of previous postpartum hemorrhage [AOR = 2.7, 95% CI (1.1, 6.8)] and instrumental delivery [AOR = 5.3, 95% CI (2.2, 12.8)] were significant predictors of primary postpartum hemorrhage.Primary postpartum hemorrhage is quite common in the study area. Mothers aged 35 and above, complications during labor, history of previous postpartum hemorrhage, and instrumental delivery were predictors of primary postpartum hemorrhage. Since postpartum hemorrhage being relatively common, all obstetrics unit members should be prepared to manage mothers who experience it."
https://openalex.org/W2982775337,"Time-varying elastance models can simulate only the pressure and volume signals in the heart chambers while the diagnosis of clinical cases and evaluation of different treatment techniques require more information. In this study, an extended model utilizing the geometric dimensions of the heart chambers was developed to describe the cardiac function. The new cardiac model was evaluated by simulating a healthy and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) condition for adults and children. The left ventricular ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume, end-diastolic diameter and diastolic sphericity index were 53.60%, 125 mL, 5.08 cm and 1.82 in the healthy adult cardiovascular system model and 23.70%, 173 mL, 6.60 cm and 1.40 in the DCM adult cardiovascular system model. In the healthy child cardiovascular system model, the left ventricular ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume, end-diastolic diameter and diastolic sphericity index were 59.70%, 92 mL, 4.10 cm and 2.26 respectively and 30.70%, 125 mL, 4.94 cm and 1.87 in the DCM child cardiovascular system model. The developed cardiovascular system model simulates the hemodynamic variables and clinical diagnostic indicators within the physiological range for healthy and DCM conditions proving the feasibility of this new model to evaluate clinical cases in adults and children."
https://openalex.org/W2982616490,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) is an integral component of the RAS pathway and a therapeutic target in RAS-driven cancers. Although tumor responses to MEK inhibition are rarely durable, MEK inhibitors have shown substantial activity and durable tumor regressions when combined with systemic immunotherapies in preclinical models of RAS-driven tumors. MEK inhibitors have been shown to potentiate anti-tumor T cell immunity, but little is known about the effects of MEK inhibition on other immune subsets, including B cells. We show here that treatment with a MEK inhibitor reduces B regulatory cells (Bregs) in vitro, and reduces the number of Bregs in tumor draining lymph nodes in a colorectal cancer model in vivo. MEK inhibition does not impede anti-tumor humoral immunity, and B cells contribute meaningfully to anti-tumor immunity in the context of MEK inhibitor therapy. Treatment with a MEK inhibitor is associated with improved T cell infiltration and an enhanced response to anti-PD1 immunotherapy. Together these data indicate that MEK inhibition may reduce Bregs while sparing anti-tumor B cell function, resulting in enhanced anti-tumor immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2982400320,"Virtual reality has become a popular means to study human behavior in a wide range of settings, including the role of pedestrians in traffic research. To understand distance perception in virtual environments is thereby crucial to the interpretation of results, as reactions to complex and dynamic traffic scenarios depend on perceptual processes allowing for the correct anticipation of future events. A number of approaches have been suggested to quantify perceived distances. While previous studies imply that the selected method influences the estimates’ accuracy, it is unclear how the respective estimates depend on depth information provided by different perceptual modalities. In the present study, six methodological approaches were compared in a virtual city scenery. The respective influence of visual and non-visual cues was investigated by manipulating the ratio between visually perceived and physically walked distances. In a repeated measures design with 30 participants, significant differences between methods were observed, with the smallest error occurring for visually guided walking and verbal estimates. A linear relation emerged between the visual-to-physical ratio and the extent of underestimation, indicating that non-visual cues during walking affected distance estimates. This relationship was mainly evident for methods building on actual or imagined walking movements and verbal estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2985975915,"Probiotics are dietary supplements containing viable, non-pathogenic microorganisms that interact with the gastrointestinal microflora and directly with the immune system. The possible health effects of probiotics include modulating the immune system and exerting antibacterial, anticancer, and anti-mutagenic effects. The purpose of this study was to isolate, identify, and characterize novel strains of probiotics from the faeces of Korean infants. Various assays were conducted to determine the physiological features of candidate probiotic isolates, including Gram staining, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, tolerance assays to stimulated gastric juice and bile salts, adherence ability assays, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and assays of immunomodulatory effects. Based on these morphological and biochemical characteristics, five potential probiotic isolates (Enterococcus faecalis BioE EF71, Lactobacillus fermentum BioE LF11, Lactobacillus plantarum BioE LPL59, Lactobacillus paracasei BioE LP08, and Streptococcus thermophilus BioE ST107) were selected. E. faecalis BioE EF71 and L. plantarum BioE LPL59 showed high tolerance to stimulated gastric juice and bile salts, and S. thermophilus BioE ST107 as well as these two strains exhibited stronger adherence ability than reference strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. All five strains inhibited secretion of lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α in RAW264.7 macrophages in vitro. L. fermentum BioE LF11, L. plantarum BioE LPL59, and S. thermophilus BioE ST107 enhanced the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the five novel strains have potential as safe probiotics and encouraged varying degrees of immunomodulatory effects."
https://openalex.org/W2982381279,"Anemia is a common clinical problem contributing to increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality during pregnancy. Anemia can be caused by different factors apart from known diseases. The main aim of this study was to identify determinants of anemia among pregnant women attending antenatal care at the public health facilities of Horo Guduru Wollega Zone, West Ethiopia, 2017.Health facility-based unmatched case-control study was conducted among 191 anemic and 382 non-anemic pregnant women from September 7, 2017, to October 25, 2017, in Horo Guduru Wollega Zone, West Ethiopia. Data were collected using pre-tested questionnaires from nine health facilities. Hemoglobin level determination, hemo-parasite diagnosis, venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test, and stool examination were done in the laboratories of the respective health centers. Cleaned and coded data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Frequency, proportion, mean and standard deviation were computed to summarize the data and presented by tables and bar graphs. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association of predictors and response variables at P ≤ 0.05. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI was used to show the strength of association between predictors and outcome variables.A total of 573 pregnant women were enrolled in this study. Monthly income < 500 Ethiopian birr (AOR = 9.16, 95% CI: 4.23, 19.82), heavy menstrual bleeding (AOR = 2.38, 95%CI: 1.38, 4.09), taking iron supplement irregularly (AOR = 2.87, 95%CI:1.41, 5.84), Mid-upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) < 23 cm (AOR = 3.42, 95%CI: 2.07, 5.63), low dietary diversity score (AOR = 12.30, 95%CI: 4.64, 32.72), medium dietary diversity score (AOR = 3.40, 95%CI:1.48, 7.84) and intestinal helminthic infections (AOR = 6.31, 95%CI: 3.44, 11.58) were significantly associated with anemia during pregnancy.Average monthly income < 500 Ethiopian birr, heavy menstrual bleeding, low and medium dietary diversity score, taking of iron supplements irregularly, MUAC < 23 cm and intestinal helminthic infections were identified as independent determinants of anemia during pregnancy. Therefore, improving dietary diversity intake, routine deworming and empowering women on taking iron regularly are vital to prevent anemia during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2989283765,"Context Many assume that having poor physical health in old age lowers life satisfaction, but in fact there are large differences in life satisfaction among older people who experience disability. Objective To investigate whether psychosocial factors modify the negative association between disability and life satisfaction in older people and whether these differ across the life course. Design Cross sectional study. Setting 66,561 community-dwelling Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) participants aged 50–106 with a mean age of 67.8 ± 9.9 (SD) years from 17 European countries and Israel. Methods Psychosocial factors included depression (EURO-D scale), perceived loneliness, having a spouse, having children, contact with children, and participation in social activities. Disability was assessed by limitations in (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) and life satisfaction by Cantril’s ladder. We also ran the analyses with the Control Autonomy Self-realization Pleasure (CASP-12) Index, a normative measure of quality of life. We used multiple linear regressions to estimate associations and proportion of variance explained. Results The variance in life satisfaction that could be attributed uniquely to ADL and IADL disability was 0.17% and 0.33% respectively (both p < 0.001). The impact of (I)ADL disabilities on life satisfaction was strongest at age 50 and gradually decreased with increasing age (p trend < 0.001). Mental health explained more variance; 5.75% for depressive symptoms and 2.50% for loneliness and for social resources this ranged from 0.09% to 0.47% (all p < 0.001). While disability has a negative effect on life satisfaction, the effect was not stronger in older persons who were depressed, neither in those who felt lonely nor in those without social resources. Similar outcomes were found when using CASP-12 as the explained variable. Conclusion The impact of (I)ADL disabilities on life satisfaction in community-dwelling older people decreases with age. These associations are not affected by psychosocial factors and these patterns cannot be explained by people changing their norms and values."
https://openalex.org/W2987708350,"Background HCV is one of the main causes of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver transplantation. Aim The aim of this study was to estimate the number of living individuals diagnosed with hepatitis C in Italy. This study also aimed to stratify these subjects as diagnosed and cured, diagnosed awaiting a cure, and undiagnosed (individuals who were not diagnosed, living or lived with hepatitis C). Methods To quantify the number of ill patients in Italy, an inquiry was conducted based on questionnaires submitted to three nationally representative regions, namely, Campania, Lazio and Piemonte, as representatives of the three main areas of Italy (North, Centre and South regions). The data were collected through a questionnaire to acquire demographic and clinical information on patients in the participating hospitals. The questionnaires contained 6 questions on sex, age, region of residence, disease condition, type of exemption and category. The questionnaires were administered individually to consecutive patients through face-to-face interviews conducted by specialised personnel in each centre. Data were collected between September 2017 and January 2018. Results In total, 2,860 questionnaires were analysed. They were completed by the patients (55% male), who had an average age of 61 years (64 years for women and 59 years for men). In total, 54% of the sample declared that they were still infected with HCV (1,548 patients out of 2,860 respondents), while the remaining subjects declared that they had been cured. The inquiry showed that 46.6% of the sample had at least a 016 exemption (chronic hepatitis), while more than 51% (1,469 interviewed patients out of 2,860 respondents) had a different type of exemption. Only 2% of the respondents declared that they had no exemption. Assuming that the analysed sample is representative of the actual HCV-positive population in Italy and considering the number of 016 exempt patients in the regional data, the model estimates that there are 443,491 cured and HCV-positive living patients and 240,043 ill patients who have yet to be treated. Conclusions Although this study has limitations, it represents a considerable improvement over the previously available studies. This study can help decision-makers implement more effective strategic planning to eliminate hepatitis C."
https://openalex.org/W2984651242,"Mitochondrial toxicity is a primary source of pre-clinical drug attrition, black box warning and post-market drug withdrawal. Methods that detect mitochondrial toxicity as early as possible during the drug development process are required. Here we introduce a new method for detecting mitochondrial toxicity based on MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing the genetically encoded FRET lactate indicator, Laconic. The method takes advantage of the high cytosolic lactate accumulation observed during mitochondrial stress, regardless of the specific toxicity mechanism, explained by compensatory glycolytic activation. Using a standard multi-well plate reader, dose-response curve experiments allowed the sensitivity of the methodology to detect metabolic toxicity induced by classical mitochondrial toxicants. Suitability for high-throughput screening applications was evaluated resulting in a Z'-factor > 0.5 and CV% < 20 inter-assay variability. A pilot screening allowed sensitive detection of commercial drugs that were previously withdrawn from the market due to liver/cardiac toxicity issues, such as camptothecin, ciglitazone, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and terfenadine, in ten minutes. We envisage that the availability of this technology, based on a fluorescent genetically encoded indicator, will allow direct assessment of mitochondrial metabolism, and will make the early detection of mitochondrial toxicity in the drug development process possible, saving time and resources."
https://openalex.org/W2986893505,"Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are defined as a collaborative approach in which the public and private sector share resources, responsibilities and risks to achieve common objectives and mutual benefits in a sustainable manner. PPPs are identified as a key solution to reinforce Veterinary Services. However only limited information is available on the scope, added value and enabling factors of PPPs in this sector. The aims of this study were to develop a typology of PPPs in the veterinary field and to identify key success factors and obstacles to their implementation. A structured questionnaire was sent to all 181 World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Member Countries and to 47 private contacts. 36 different variables characterizing PPP initiatives were collected. 97 examples of PPPs were retrieved from 76 countries. Dimensionality reduction techniques were combined with clustering and discrimination methods to establish a typology of PPPs and to derive a set of simple rules to classify new instances of PPPs. Three clusters were identified, separated according to two main variables: the type of private partners and the type of interaction. Cluster 1, transactional PPPs, represented the traditional understanding of PPPs by Veterinary Services, initiated and funded by the public sector, giving service delivery accreditation to mostly private veterinarians; cluster 2, collaborative PPPs, included partnerships between producer associations and public Veterinary Services, driven by trade interests; cluster 3, transformational PPPs, represented joint programs initiated and funded by private companies and initially driven by business development objectives. Specific success factors and key obstacles affecting the performances and sustainability of these initiatives were identified for each cluster. This study represents the first practical attempt to develop a meaningful typology of PPPs in the field of animal health and to identify fundamental obstacles currently inhibiting the development of PPPs, and suggests ways to support national Veterinary Services in overcoming these obstacles."
https://openalex.org/W2985407598,"With the development of economic globalization and information technology, enterprises pay more attention to the sustainable development of their e-commerce. Under this trend, we study the subsidy strategy commonly used by pharmaceutical e-commerce platforms in two-sided market. Based on the two-sided market theory, we set up the two-sided user's utility function and formulate the subsidy strategy as the decision of platform profit optimization. We show that the platform chooses to subsidize consumers only if the net income from consumer is lower than the total revenue of drug retailers and platforms in each transaction; the maximum profit for platform increases with the intensity of the network externality. This study provides theoretical support and decision-making suggestions for the pharmaceutical e-commerce platforms to capture the market share, obtain higher profits and ultimately achieve the sustainable development goal."
https://openalex.org/W2986101025,"Next generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a flexible approach that can be applied to a range of applications including global quantification of transcript expression, the characterization of RNA structure such as splicing patterns and profiling of expressed mutations. Many RNA-seq protocols require up to microgram levels of total RNA input amounts to generate high quality data, and thus remain impractical for the limited starting material amounts typically obtained from rare cell populations, such as those from early developmental stages or from laser micro-dissected clinical samples. Here, we present an assessment of the contemporary ribosomal RNA depletion-based protocols, and identify those that are suitable for inputs as low as 1–10 ng of intact total RNA and 100–500 ng of partially degraded RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2983247065,"Eco-engineering and the installation of green infrastructure such as artificial floating islands (AFIs), are novel techniques used to support biodiversity. The European Convention on Biological Diversity highlighted the development of green infrastructure as a key method of enhancement in degraded habitats. Research specifically on AFIs in marine environments has largely focused on their ecological functioning role and engineering outcomes, with little consideration for the social benefits or concerns. The aim of this study was to gain an understanding of public perception of coastal habitat loss in the UK and AFIs as a method of habitat creation in coastal environments. This was achieved via a survey, consisting of six closed and two open questions. Of the 200 respondents, 94.5% were concerned about the loss of coastal habitats in the UK, but less than a third were aware of habitat restoration or creation projects in their area of residence. There was a positive correlation between proximity of residency to the coast and knowledge of habitat restoration or creation projects. The majority of the respondents understood the ecological functioning role of AFIs and 62% would preferably want successful plant growth and avian species utilising the AFI. Nearly a third of the respondents had concerns about AFI installations, such as the degradation of the plastic matrix, long term maintenance and disturbance of native species. Despite 90.9% of the respondents supporting the installation of AFIs, the concerns of the public must be addressed during the planning stages of any habitat creation project."
https://openalex.org/W2982499498,"Heart failure is a global epidemic. Left ventricular assist devices provide added cardiac output for severe cases but cause infection and thromboembolism. Proposed direct cardiac compression devices eliminate blood contacting surfaces, but no group has optimized the balance between hemodynamic benefit and excessive ventricular wall strains and stresses. Here, we use left ventricular simulations to apply compressions and analyze hemodynamics as well as regional wall mechanics. This axisymmetric model corresponds with current symmetric bench prototypes. At nominal pressures of 3.1 kPa applied over the epicardial compression zone, hemodynamics improved substantially. Ejection fraction changed from 17.6% at baseline to 30.3% with compression and stroke work nearly doubled. Parametric studies were conducted by increasing and decreasing applied pressures; ejection fraction, peak pressure, and stroke work increased linearly with changes in applied compression. End-systolic volume decreased substantially. Regional mechanics analysis showed principal stress increases at the endocardium, in the middle of the compression region. Principal strains remained unchanged or increased moderately with nominal compression. However, at maximum applied compression, stresses and strains increased substantially providing potential constraints on allowable compressions. These results demonstrate a framework for analysis and optimization of cardiac compression as a prelude to biventricular simulations and subsequent animal experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2985626566,"Three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) occur in mammals. High levels of NO produced by NOS2/iNOS can protect against bacterial and parasitic infections, but the role of NOS in fungal innate immunity is less clear. Compared to wild type mice, Nos3-/- mice showed significantly higher survival of candidemia caused by Candida albicans SC5314. NOS3/eNOS is expressed by endothelial cells in the kidney, and colonization of this organ was decreased during the sub-acute stage of disseminated candidiasis. Nos3-/- mice more rapidly eliminated Candida from the renal cortex and exhibited more balanced local inflammatory reactions, with similar macrophage but less neutrophil infiltration than in infected wild type. Levels of the serum cytokines IL-9, IL-12, IL-17 and chemokines GM-CSF, MIP1α, and MIP1β were significantly elevated, and IL-15 was significantly lower in infected Nos3-/- mice. Spleens of infected Nos3-/- mice had significantly more Th2 and Th9 but not other CD4+ T cells compared with wild type. Inflammatory genes associated with leukocyte chemotaxis, IL-1 signaling, TLR signaling and Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation pathways were significantly overexpressed in infected Nos3-/- kidneys, with Nos2 being the most strongly induced. Conversely, the general NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester increased virulence in the mouse candidemia model, suggesting that iNOS contributes to the protective mechanism in infected Nos3-/- mice. By moderating neutrophil infiltration, the absence of eNOS may reduce the collateral damage to kidney cortex, and Th-9 CD4+ cells may enhance clearance of the infection. These data suggest that selective eNOS inhibition could mitigate candidemia by a combination of systemic and local responses that promote a more effective host immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2987967058,"Soil-borne fungi influence coexistence of plant species in mesic environments, but much less is known about their effects on demographic processes relevant to coexistence in arid and semi-arid systems. We isolated 43 fungal strains that naturally colonize seeds of an invasive winter annual (Brassica tournefortii) in the Sonoran Desert, and evaluated the impact of 18 of them on seed germination and mortality of B. tournefortii and a co-occurring native annual (Plantago ovata) under simulated summer and winter temperatures. Fungi isolated from B. tournefortii seeds impacted germination and mortality of seeds of both plant species in vitro. Seed responses reflected host-specific effects by fungi, the degree of which differed significantly between the strains, and depended on the temperature. In the winter temperature, ten fungal strains increased or reduced seed germination, but substantial seed mortality due to fungi was not observed. Two strains increased germination of P. ovata more strongly than B. tournefortii. In the summer temperature, fungi induced both substantial seed germination and mortality, with ten strains demonstrating host-specificity. Under natural conditions, host-specific effects of fungi on seed germination may further differentiate plant species niche in germination response, with a potential of promoting coexistence. Both host-specific and non-host-specific effects of fungi on seed loss may induce polarizing effects on plant coexistence depending on the ecological context. The coexistence theory provides a clear framework to interpret these polarizing effects. Moreover, fungi pathogenic to both plant species could induce host-specific germination, which challenges the theoretical assumption of density-independent germination response. These implications from an in vitro study underscore the need to weave theoretical modeling, reductive empirical experiments, and natural observations to illuminate effects of soil-borne fungi on coexistence of annual plant species in variable desert environments."
https://openalex.org/W2985288735,"Until recently, Czech taxonomists often treated Betula carpatica as a distinct species. Several morphological traits for distinguishing B. carpatica from B. pubescens or other birches are described in literature; however, it has been proven impossible to reliably identify B. carpatica in the field. With the use of morphological and molecular approaches, we intended to assess the position of B. carpatica in the context of other birch taxa reported from the Bohemian Massif and to find more reliable morphological traits for their identification. In our dataset, we distinguished the following birch taxa referred to in the recent Czech literature: B. pendula, B. pubescens, B. carpatica, B. oycoviensis, B. nana, B. petraea and B. ×seideliana. We complemented them with triploids and several diploid and tetraploid ""working units"" into which we included intermediate individuals that in terms of morphology did not unambiguously match any of the abovementioned birch taxa. Holoploid genome size was measured to determine the ploidy level. To identify genetic relationships between selected taxa and ""working units"", microsatellite analyses were performed. Model-based STRUCTURE analysis together with principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on genetic distances was performed to identify the similarities in multilocus genotype data between groups distinguished in the dataset. The applied analyses were not able clearly to distinguish any group among tetraploid individuals. In this light, it was of no use to search for any more reliable morphological traits of B. carpatica and also B. petraea. Among diploids, B. nana was always distinguished, in contrast to B. oycoviensis, which was not genetically recognized despite being usually morphologically distinct. Based on our results and a literature review, we suggest that B. carpatica and also the closely similar B. petraea should not be considered separate species. A similar conclusion seems relevant also for B. oycoviensis; however, further verification is desirable in this case."
https://openalex.org/W2985918245,"G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) participate in the majority of signal transduction processes in the body. Specifically, the binding of an external agonist promotes coupling of the GPCR to its G protein and this, in turn, induces downstream signaling. Recently, it was shown that agonist binding to the M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R) and to other GPCRs is voltage dependent. Here we examine, whether the coupling of the M2R to its G protein is also voltage-dependent. We first show, in Xenopus oocytes, that the activity of the M2R in the absence of agonist (constitutive activity) can be used to report the coupling. We then show that the coupling is, by itself, voltage dependent. This novel finding is of physiological importance, as it shows that the actual signal transduction, whose first step is the coupling of the GPCR to its cognate G protein, is voltage dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2987699098,"In our previous study, we found that horizontal ocular deviation (OD) was significantly increased in patients with unilateral vestibular neuritis (VN). This study is aimed to compare the measurements of horizontal OD in various diseases which can present as acute vertigo in the emergency department. We retrospectively reviewed patients who visited the emergency department and underwent brain MRI due to acute vertigo. We compared them to healthy controls who underwent brain MRI for a regular health examination. Among the study participants, 149 patients who were diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), unilateral Ménière's disease (MD), vestibular migraine (VM), unilateral vestibular neuritis (VN), or posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) infarction were enrolled. Absolute angles of horizontal OD were larger in the definite MD (19.1 ± 12.7°), possible and probable MD (15.5 ± 11.7°), and VN (22.2 ± 11.7°) groups compared to the control group (4.3 ± 3.7°). Most VN patients (83.3%) had horizontal OD toward the direction of the lesion. About half of the MD patients (46.2%) and half of the patients with PICA infarction (50.0%) had horizontal OD toward the opposite direction of the lesion. Regarding PICA infarction, horizontal OD was observed only in patients who immediately underwent an MRI after developing the PICA territory vestibulocerebellar infarction. Although the exact mechanism of horizontal OD is unclear, this study suggests that horizontal OD reflects a static vestibular imbalance, and that the eyeball is deviated to the weaker of the two vestibular nuclei during neural resting activity. Therefore, horizontal OD could be helpful in assessing for a prior vestibular imbalance."

As there are no conclusive studies on the specific effects of biochar application on tobacco quality, this study aimed to improve the yield and quality of tobacco as a model crop for economic and genetic research in southern China, by such application. We used transcriptome sequencing to reveal the effects of applied biochar on tobacco development before and after topping. Our results showed that topping affected carbon and nitrogen metabolism, photosynthesis and secondary metabolism in the tobacco plants, while straw biochar-application to the soil resulted in amino acid and lipid synthesis; additionally, it affected secondary metabolism of the tobacco plants through carbon restoration and hormonal action, before and after topping. In addition to the new insights into the impact of biochar on crops, our findings provide a basis for biochar application measures in tobacco and other crops."
https://openalex.org/W2982914835,"Several inherited human diseases have been linked to mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (mtARSs). Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL) is a leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the DARS2 gene which encodes mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. As mitochondrial ARSs are key components of the mitochondrial translation apparatus, we investigated the effects of DARS2 mutations on mitochondrial functions and mitochondrial morphology in an LBSL patient. In fibroblasts from the patient with LBSL, biosynthesis of respiratory chain complex proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA was decreased, while those encoded by nuclear DNA were not. Cellular oxygen consumption rates and respiratory control ratio were decreased in the LBSL patient; in addition, fragmentation of mitochondria was increased, while their tubular elongation and interconnectivity were decreased. Taken together, these findings suggest that DARS2 mutations impair translations of mitochondrial DNA-encoded respiratory chain complex proteins, consequently causing dysfunction of cellular respiration and impediment of mitochondrial dynamics, which highlights the role of mtARSs in the maintenance of normal mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2983324485,"The accuracy of four machine learning methods in predicting narrative macrostructure scores was compared to scores obtained by human raters utilizing a criterion-referenced progress monitoring rubric. The machine learning methods that were explored covered methods that utilized hand-engineered features, as well as those that learn directly from the raw text. The predictive models were trained on a corpus of 414 narratives from a normative sample of school-aged children (5;0-9;11) who were given a standardized measure of narrative proficiency. Performance was measured using Quadratic Weighted Kappa, a metric of inter-rater reliability. The results indicated that one model, BERT, not only achieved significantly higher scoring accuracy than the other methods, but was consistent with scores obtained by human raters using a valid and reliable rubric. The findings from this study suggest that a machine learning method, specifically, BERT, shows promise as a way to automate the scoring of narrative macrostructure for potential use in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2983834937,"Rice plant architecture affects biomass and grain yield. Thus, it is important to select rice genotypes with ideal plant architecture. High-throughput phenotyping by use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) allows all lines in a field to be observed in less time than with traditional procedures. However, discrimination of plants in dense plantings is difficult, especially during the reproductive stage, because leaves and panicles overlap. Here, we developed an original method that relies on using UAV to identify panicle positions for dissecting plant architecture and to distinguish rice lines by detecting red flags attached to panicle bases. The plant architecture of recombinant inbred lines derived from Japanese cultivars 'Hokuriku 193' and 'Mizuhochikara', which differ in plant architecture, was assessed using a commercial camera-UAV system. Orthomosaics were made from UAV digital images. The center of plants was plotted on the image during the vegetative stage. The horizontal distance from the center to the red flag during the reproductive stage was used as the panicle position (PP). The red flags enabled us to recognize the positions of the panicles at a rate of 92%. The PP phenotype was related to but was not identical with the phenotypes of the panicle base angle, leaf sheath angle, and score of spreading habit. These results indicate that PP on orthomosaics could be used as an index of plant architecture under field conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2986130858,"St. Augustinegrass (Stenotaphrum secundatum) is a warm-season grass species commonly utilized as turf in the southeastern US. Improvement in the drought tolerance of St. Augustinegrass has significant value within the turfgrass industry. Detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with drought tolerance will allow for advanced breeding strategies to identify St. Augustinegrass germplasm with improved performance for this trait. A multi-year and multi-environment study was performed to identify QTL in a 'Raleigh' x 'Seville' mapping population segregating for phenotypic traits associated with drought tolerance. Phenotypic data was collected from a field trial and a two-year greenhouse study, which included relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll content (CHC), leaf firing (LF), leaf wilting (LW), green cover (GC) and normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI). Significant phenotypic variance was observed and a total of 70 QTL were detected for all traits. A genomic region on linkage group R6 simultaneously harbored QTL for RWC, LF and LW in different experiments. In addition, overlapping QTL for GC, LF, LW and NDVI were found on linkage groups R1, R5, R7 and S2. Sequence alignment analysis revealed several drought response genes within these regions. The QTL identified in this study have potential to be used in the future to identify genes associated with drought tolerance and for use in marker-assisted breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2987774273,"The methodological challenges to effectiveness evaluation of complex interventions has been widely discussed. Bottom-up case management for frail older person was implemented in Belgium, and indeed, it was evaluated as a complex intervention. This paper presents the methodological approach we developed to respond to four main methodological challenges regarding the evaluation of case management: (1) the standardization of the interventions, (2) stratification of the frail older population that was used to test various modalities of case management with different risks groups, (3) the building of a control group, and (4) the use of multiple outcomes in evaluating case management. To address these challenges, we developed a mixed-methods approach that (1) used multiple embedded case studies to classify case management types according to their characteristics and implementation conditions; and (2) compared subgroups of beneficiaries with specific needs (defined by Principal Component Analysis prior to cluster analysis) and a control group receiving 'usual care', to evaluate the effectiveness of case management. The beneficiaries' subgroups were matched using propensity scores and compared using generalized pairwise comparison and the hurdle model with the control group. Our results suggest that the impact of case management on patient health and the services used varies according to specific needs and categories of case management. However, these equivocal results question our methodological approach. We suggest to reconsider the evaluation approach by moving away from a viewing case management as an intervention. Rather, it should be considered as a process of interconnected actions taking place within a complex system."
https://openalex.org/W2982322548,"Objective Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) are neonates born with birth weight below the 10th centile for a given week of pregnancy. It is a risk factor of perinatal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is an ongoing debate whether prenatal detection of SGA neonates is good predictor of perinatal outcome especially in low risk populations. Our primary aim was to compare the odds ratios for unfavorable outcome in a risk stratified cohort of SGA neonates in regard to prenatal detection status. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study analysing the effect of prenatal detection on perinatal outcome. This cohort has been divided into a predefined low-risk and high-risk population. Electronic records of 39,032 singleton deliveries from 2010 through 2016 were analysed. SGA was defined as newborn weight below the 10th percentile on the Fenton growth chart. Detected SGA (dSGA) neonates were those that were admitted for delivery with a prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of abnormal growth. Undetected SGA (uSGA) were neonates that were found to be below the 10th percentile after birth. Perinatal and neonatal outcome was compared. Results The detection rate in high-risk pregnancies was almost 45.7% versus low risk where it amounted to 18.9%. In both the high-risk and low-risk populations there was a significantly higher risk of composite mortality for undetected SGA compared to approporiate-for-gestational-age (AGA) (OR 7.95 CI 4.76–13.29; OR 14.4 CI 4.99–41.45 respectively). The odds for the composite neonatal outcome were significantly higher for dSGA and uSGA than for AGA in all the studied populations except for the uSGA in high risk population (OR 1.57 CI 0.97–3.53). Importantly, there was not a single case of intrauterine fetal death among detected SGA, in the low risk group. Conclusions Prenatal detection of SGA status is related to perinatal outcomes, especially mortality. Therefore, assessment of SGA status even in low-risk pregnancies could help predict potential perinatal and neonatal complications."
https://openalex.org/W2982635146,"Indicators of emotional processes (positive experiences with physical exercises) and functional processes (mobility) were previously found to be associated with positive cognitive resources (meaning in life), and the key outcome in the rehabilitation, namely physical quality of life (QOL). Yet, the mediating roles of such processes were not tested. Therefore, this prospective study investigated whether the relationship between meaning in life and physical QOL was mediated by positive experiences with physical exercises and mobility.Prospective data were collected at two measurement points, 1 month apart. A total of N = 339 participants (aged 19-84 years old, 57.9% women) provided data at Time 1 (T1) at the beginning of inpatient rehabilitation from central nervous system diseases (CNSD, e.g., stroke; n = 89) or musculoskeletal system diseases (MSD, e.g., dorsopathies; n = 250), and n = 234 at Time 2 (T2, the end of rehabilitation; 4 weeks after T1). Mediation analysis with meaning in life as predictor (T1), positive experiences with physical exercises and mobility as sequential mediators (T2), and physical QOL (T2) as the outcome was conducted.Higher meaning in life (T1) predicted more positive experiences with physical exercises (T2), which were associated with a higher level of mobility (T2), which in turn was associated with better physical quality of life (T2).Meaning in life at the beginning of inpatient rehabilitation may trigger positive experiences with physical exercises and functional changes in mobility levels, leading to better physical quality of life. Screening for low meaning in life may allow to identify patients who are at risk for a lack of improvement of mobility and physical quality of life during rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2984829872,"Soil microbes live within highly complex communities, where community composition, function, and evolution are the product of diverse interactions among community members. Analysis of the complex networks of interactions within communities has the potential to shed light on community stability, functioning, and evolution. However, we have little understanding of the variation in interaction networks among coevolved soil populations. We evaluated networks of antibiotic inhibitory interactions among sympatric Streptomyces communities from prairie soil. Inhibition networks differed significantly in key network characteristics from expectations under null models, largely reflecting variation among Streptomyces in the number of sympatric populations that they inhibited. Moreover, networks of inhibitory interactions within Streptomyces communities differed significantly from each other, suggesting unique network structures among soil communities from different locations. Analyses of tri-partite interactions (triads) showed that some triads were significantly over- or under- represented, and that communities differed in 'preferred' triads. These results suggest that local processes generate distinct structures among sympatric Streptomyces inhibition networks in soil. Understanding the properties of microbial interaction networks that generate competitive and functional capacities of soil communities will shed light on the ecological and coevolutionary history of sympatric populations, and provide a foundation for more effective management of inhibitory capacities of soil microbial communities."

To this end, the recommendation system within a social network adopts topical attention and probabilistic matrix factorization (STAPMF) is proposed. We combine the trust information in social networks and the topical information from review documents by proposing a novel algorithm combining probabilistic matrix factorization and attention-based recurrent neural networks to extract item underlying feature vectors, user's personal potential feature vectors, and user's social hidden feature vectors, which represent the features extracted from the user's trusted network. Using real-world datasets, we show a significant improvement in recommendation performance comparing with the prevailing state-of-the-art algorithms for social network-based recommendation."
https://openalex.org/W2988780968,"Additional surgical resection should be considered for the patients with pathological findings beyond the expanded criteria with the risk for LN metastasis. However, close observation without additional surgery may be applied because of various reasons. We aimed to determine the clinical outcomes of early gastric cancer beyond the expanded criteria after endoscopic resection according to the pathological extent. A total of 288 patients with 289 lesions beyond the expanded criteria of endoscopic submucosal dissection for early gastric cancer were analyzed between 2005 and 2016, and classified into two groups according to additional treatment: observation (n = 175 patients, 175 lesions) and surgery (n = 113 patients, 114 lesions). The depth of tumor invasion was greater and the tumor-positive vertical margin and lymphatic and venous invasion were more common in the surgery group than in the observation group (P<0.001). Residual, synchronous, and metachronous tumors were more common in the observation group; however, the occurrence of regional lymph node and distant metastasis did not differ between the groups. Overall survival and 5-year disease-specific survival did not differ between the groups (observation vs surgery, 88.6 vs 93.8%; P = 0.259, 98.2 vs 100%; P = 0.484, respectively), but the 5-year disease-free survival was lower in the observation group (73.5 vs 97.9%; P<0.001). On multivariate analysis, tumor-positive lateral margin was a risk factor for residual tumor and lymphatic and venous invasion were risk factors for regional lymph node metastasis. In conclusion, the clinical course of beyond the expanded criteria of endoscopic submucosal dissection for early gastric cancer showed good prognosis over 98% in 5-year disease specific survival. If additional surgery cannot be performed, a close follow-up with endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography can be considered as an alternative for carefully selected patients without lymphatic and vascular invasion."

Like a key in a lock, these proteins require many contacts to specify the correct DNA sequence. Using information theory we develop an equation that defines the number of independent contacts, which is the dimensionality of the binding. We show that EcoRI, which binds to the sequence GAATTC, functions in 24 dimensions. Information theory represents messages as spheres in high dimensional spaces. Better sphere packing leads to better communications systems. The densest known packing of hyperspheres occurs on the Leech lattice in 24 dimensions. We suggest that the single protein EcoRI molecule employs a Leech lattice in its operation. Optimizing density of sphere packing explains why 6 base restriction enzymes are so common."

The tests consisted of 30 shots in prone position and 30 in standing position on a 10 ring electronic target, on a distance of 50 metres, without any time limit, at rest.Caffeine supplementation entailed a mean decrease in shooting performance by 11.8 points (95% CI: 6.7 to 17.0, effect size: 0.9). This was primarily a result of an 11.3 (95% CI: 7.2 to 15.4, effect size: 0.9) point decrease during shooting in standing position and not in prone position (0.6 point decrease, 95% CI: -2.1 to 3.2, effect size: 0.1).We conclude that prior ingestion of 300 mg caffeine impairs rifle shooting accuracy in trained shooters when performed in standing but not in prone position."
https://openalex.org/W2983873342,"Vocal communication in social animals plays a crucial role in mate choice, maintaining social structure, and foraging strategy. The Indian grey wolf, among the least studied subspecies, is a social carnivore that lives in groups called packs and has many types of vocal communication. In this study, we characterise harmonic vocalisation types of the Indian wolf using howl survey responses and opportunistic recordings from captive and nine packs (each pack contains 2–9 individuals) of free-ranging Indian wolves. Using principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering, and discriminant function analysis, we found four distinct vocalisations using 270 recorded vocalisations (Average Silhouette width Si = 0.598) which include howls and howl-barks (N = 238), whimper (N = 2), social squeak (N = 28), and whine (N = 2). Although having a smaller body size compared to other wolf subspecies, Indian wolf howls have an average mean fundamental frequency of 422 Hz (±126), which is similar to other wolf subspecies. The whimper showed the highest frequency modulation (37.296±4.601) and the highest mean fundamental frequency (1708±524 Hz) compared to other call types. Less information is available on the third vocalisation type, i.e. ‘Social squeak’ or ‘talking’ (Mean fundamental frequency = 461±83 Hz), which is highly variable (coefficient of frequency variation = 18.778±3.587). Lastly, we identified the whine, which had a mean fundamental frequency of 906Hz (±242) and is similar to the Italian wolf (979±109 Hz). Our study’s characterisation of the Indian wolf’s harmonic vocal repertoire provides a first step in understanding the function and contextual use of vocalisations in this social mammal."

Seasonal patterns have to our knowledge not previously been systematically investigated and are poorly understood. We investigate emerging seasonal changes in clinical aspects like potentially increasing hospitalization during the year, variations in clinical symptoms and disease severity during the season and seasonal dynamics of fatal outcomes.TBEV infection became a notifiable disease in Germany in 2001. We used the national reporting dataset spanning from 2001-2018, provided by the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI). There were general epidemiological variables available, including ""symptom onset"", ""age"" and ""sex"". Furthermore, several variables documented disease severity. These included ""CNS symptoms"", ""myelitis"", ""fatal outcome"" and ""hospitalization"". Potential factors influencing the occurrence of CNS symptoms, myelitis, hospitalizations and fatal outcome were analyzed using logistic regression models. Linear trends, including the ""time point in year"" at which TBEV infection related symptoms were detected, were tested using calendar year as a continuous covariate. In addition, seasonal trends and age and sex specific differences were exploratively tested for non-linear effects using restricted cubic splines with knot locations based on Harrell's recommended percentiles. Finally, the dynamic relationship between in-seasonal trends year of detection, sex and age was tested using interaction terms.6,073 TBEV infection cases from 2001-2018 were included in our analysis. We find that from 2001-2018 TBEV infections are reported 0.69 days earlier each year (p<0.001). There was no detectable seasonal variation regarding the occurrence of fatal outcome, CNS and myelitis. However, there was a significant changing trend regarding hospitalizations over the course of the year: The risk for hospitalization increases until August, decreases again from October on.We present epidemiological evidence that the TBE season in Germany has shifted to start earlier over the last years, beginning approximately 12 days earlier in 2018 than it did in 2001. There are seasonal patterns regarding a higher risk of hospitalization during August."
https://openalex.org/W2982526942,"Teredinid bivalves, commonly referred to as shipworms, are known for their propensity to inhabit, bioerode, and digest woody substrates across a range of brackish and fully marine settings. Shipworm body fossils and/or their borings, which are most allied with the ichnotaxon Teredolites longissimus, are found in wood preserved in sedimentary sequences ranging in age from Early Cretaceous to Recent and traditionally they have been regarded as evidence of marginal marine or marine depositional environments. Recent studies associated with the Philippine Mollusk Symbiont International Collaboration Biodiversity Group (PMS-ICBG) expedition on the island of Bohol, Philippines, have identified a new shipworm taxon (Lithoredo abatanica) that is responsible for macrobioerosion of a moderately indurated Neogene foraminiferal packstone cropping out along a freshwater reach of the Abatan River. In the process of drilling into and ingesting the limestone, these shipworms produce elongate borings that expand in diameter very gradually toward distal termini, exhibit sinuous or highly contorted axes and circular transverse outlines, and are lined along most of their length by a calcite tube. Given their strong resemblance to T. longissimus produced in wood but their unusual occurrence in a lithic substrate, these shipworm borings can be regarded as incipient Gastrochaenolites or, alternatively, as Apectoichnus. The alternate names reflect that the borings provide a testbed for ideas of the appropriateness of substrate as an ichnotaxobasis. The discovery of previously unrecognized shipworm borings in lithic substrates and the co-occurrence of another shipworm (Nausitora) in submerged logs in the same freshwater setting have implications for interpreting depositional conditions based on fossil teredinids or their ichnofossils. Of equal significance, the Abatan River study demonstrates that macrobioerosion in freshwater systems may be just as important as it is in marine systems with regard to habitat creation and landscape development. L. abatanica serve as ecosystems engineers in the sense that networks of their abandoned borings provide habitats for a variety of nestling invertebrates, and associated bioerosion undoubtedly enhances rates of mechanical and chemical degradation, thus influencing the Abatan River profile."
https://openalex.org/W2982638734,"The goal of the present study was to examine whether the effect of visual context on the interpretation of facial expression from an actor's face could be produced using isolated photographic stills, instead of the typical dynamic film sequences used to demonstrate the effect. Two-photograph sequences consisting of a context photograph varying in pleasantness and a photograph of an actor's neutral face were presented. Participants performed a liking rating task for the context photograph (to ensure attention to the stimulus) and they performed three tasks for the face stimulus: labeling the emotion portrayed by the actor, rating valence, and rating arousal. The results of the labeling data confirmed the existence of a visual context effect, with more faces labeled as ""happy"" after viewing pleasant context and more faces labeled ""sad"" or ""fearful"" after viewing unpleasant context. This effect was demonstrated when no explicit connection between the context stimulus and face stimulus was invoked, with the contextual information exerting its effect on labeling after being held in memory for at least 10 seconds. The results for ratings of valence and arousal were mixed. Overall, the results suggest that isolated photograph sequences produce a Kuleshov-type context effect on attributions of emotion to actors' faces, replicating previous research conducted with dynamic film sequences."

Further, consumer and clinician participation in service development processes can boost confidence and motivation levels in organisational employees and help foster clinical accountability.To see where consumers' care experiences could be improved by better understanding where care coordination organisational systems needed improvement.Experienced based co-design informed an investigation of consumer and clinician experiences of a care coordination service and involved the sharing of those experiences across service employees in a series of iterative and feedback loops over eighteen months (July 2012-January 2014). Formal participants included care coordination clinicians (n = 13) and consumers. Data from formal participants were collected during September-December 2012, consisting of consumer video-recorded and clinician audio-recorded interviews. Interview transcriptions were analysed to identify service ""touch points"", being emotionally significant events related to key service aspects that connect or disconnect consumers and/or clinicians.Results revealed that consumers highly valued the transdisciplinary skill base of the care coordination workforce, though service improvements were needed for transition support, quality discharge planning and conveying better understandings of care coordination activity both internally and externally.Incorporating consumer and clinician view-points about their experiences, including the production of a DVD, facilitated conversations across the entire service about care coordination provision and provided a catalyst for design improvement that may otherwise have been difficult to achieve. Some changes to the service were made such as improved client complaints processes, new roles for the care coordination service, and enlisting clinical staff to undertake motivational interviewing training to promote greater consumer self-management capacity. In this study, the user experience was given a platform within a larger healthcare workforce capability development project."

There is a need to understand more about this young group of persons since they often have problems with mobility and gait, but they may also face participation restrictions due to issues associated with integration into a new community and culture.A total of 14 young immigrants with late effects of polio participated and were interviewed individually. The study used a qualitative method to explore personal experiences and the interviews were analyzed through an inductive approach, using qualitative content analysis.The analysis led to a major theme; self-image and acceptance, that comprised a changeable process and experiences of cultural, social, and gender-specific barriers, but also of environmental and personal factors that impacted their outdoor mobility. By using a car, the participants felt they could come across as normal which also increased their self-esteem.Independent mobility is a major enabler for ongoing employment and being able to use a car increases the chances for integration into society for young immigrants with late effects of polio. Public transport is not considered to be adequate or efficient enough due to the participants' mobility impairments, but driving can prevent involuntary isolation and facilitate participation. A car can increase quality of life but may also be a facilitator for work and reduce the demand for societal support."
https://openalex.org/W2986975611,"Many biological data sets are prepared using one-shot sampling, in which each individual organism is sampled at most once. Time series therefore do not follow trajectories of individuals over time. However, samples collected at different times from individuals grown under the same conditions share the same perturbations of the biological processes, and hence behave as surrogates for multiple samples from a single individual at different times. This implies the importance of growing individuals under multiple conditions if one-shot sampling is used. This paper models the condition effect explicitly by using condition-dependent nominal mRNA production amounts for each gene, it quantifies the performance of network structure estimators both analytically and numerically, and it illustrates the difficulty in network reconstruction under one-shot sampling when the condition effect is absent. A case study of an Arabidopsis circadian clock network model is also included."

https://openalex.org/W2982383953,"The detection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is important for early diagnosis of precancerous cervical lesion. The distribution of HR-HPV genotypes in East Asia is different from that in Western countries. HR-HPVs non-16/18 including HPV-58 are highly prevalent in East Asia. Thus, a variety of HPV tests that could identify individual genotypes have been widely used. HPV 9G DNA is a deoxyribonucleic acid-based chip test, while PANArray HPV chip is a peptide nucleic acid-based array. We compared the analytic performance of these two chips for detecting and genotyping HR-HPV using 356 liquid-based cytology specimens and evaluated their diagnostic accuracies based on direct sequencing. For identifying HR-HPV, PANArray HPV and HPV 9G DNA chips agreed with each other for 85.1% of samples. Overall strength of agreement between the two tests was substantial (k = 0.68). Specifically, these two tests almost perfectly agreed for detecting several types of HR-HPV, including HPV-16, -18, -35, -52, -58, and -59 (k>0.81 for all). According to direct sequencing, PANArray HPV produced consistently higher sensitivities for detecting HR-HPV than HPV 9G DNA for either overall or individual genotypes of HR-HPV. Sensitivities and specificities for detecting HPV-58 were perfect (100%) with PANArray HPV. In conclusion, PANArray HPV is more effective than HPV 9G DNA in detecting HR-HPV. It is more useful for regions with high prevalent HPV-58 infection."
https://openalex.org/W4253664985,"Spatially heterogeneous flicker, characterized by probabilistic and locally independent luminance modulations, abounds in nature. It is generated by flames, water surfaces, rustling leaves, and so on, and it is pleasant to the senses. It affords spatiotemporal multistability that allows sensory activation conforming to the biases of the visual system, thereby generating the perception of spontaneous motion and likely facilitating the calibration of motion detectors. One may thus hypothesize that spatially heterogeneous flicker might potentially provide restoring stimuli to the visual system that engage fluent (requiring minimal top-down control) and self-calibrating processes. Here, we present some converging behavioral and electrophysiological evidence consistent with this idea. Spatially heterogeneous (multistable) flicker (relative to controls matched in temporal statistics) reduced posterior EEG (electroencephalography) beta power implicated in long-range neural interactions that impose top-down influences on sensory processing. Further, the degree of spatiotemporal multistability, the amount of posterior beta-power reduction, and the aesthetic responses to flicker were closely associated. These results are consistent with the idea that the pleasantness of natural flicker may derive from its spatiotemporal multistability that affords fluent and self-calibrating visual processing."
