https://openalex.org/W2005855529,"Avian influenza A viruses rarely infect humans; however, when human infection and subsequent human-to-human transmission occurs, worldwide outbreaks (pandemics) can result. The recent sporadic infections of humans in China with a previously unrecognized avian influenza A virus of the H7N9 subtype (A(H7N9)) have caused concern owing to the appreciable case fatality rate associated with these infections (more than 25%), potential instances of human-to-human transmission, and the lack of pre-existing immunity among humans to viruses of this subtype. Here we characterize two early human A(H7N9) isolates, A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9); hereafter referred to as Anhui/1 and Shanghai/1, respectively. In mice, Anhui/1 and Shanghai/1 were more pathogenic than a control avian H7N9 virus (A/duck/Gunma/466/2011 (H7N9); Dk/GM466) and a representative pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus (A/California/4/2009 (H1N1pdm09); CA04). Anhui/1, Shanghai/1 and Dk/GM466 replicated well in the nasal turbinates of ferrets. In nonhuman primates, Anhui/1 and Dk/GM466 replicated efficiently in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, whereas the replicative ability of conventional human influenza viruses is typically restricted to the upper respiratory tract of infected primates. By contrast, Anhui/1 did not replicate well in miniature pigs after intranasal inoculation. Critically, Anhui/1 transmitted through respiratory droplets in one of three pairs of ferrets. Glycan arrays showed that Anhui/1, Shanghai/1 and A/Hangzhou/1/2013 (H7N9) (a third human A(H7N9) virus tested in this assay) bind to human virus-type receptors, a property that may be critical for virus transmissibility in ferrets. Anhui/1 was found to be less sensitive in mice to neuraminidase inhibitors than a pandemic H1N1 2009 virus, although both viruses were equally susceptible to an experimental antiviral polymerase inhibitor. The robust replicative ability in mice, ferrets and nonhuman primates and the limited transmissibility in ferrets of Anhui/1 suggest that A(H7N9) viruses have pandemic potential."

It is unclear how to develop these sensory epithelia from pluripotent stem cells, a process that will be critical for modelling inner ear disorders or developing cell-based therapies for profound hearing loss and balance disorders. So far, attempts to derive inner ear mechanosensitive hair cells and sensory neurons have resulted in inefficient or incomplete phenotypic conversion of stem cells into inner-ear-like cells. A key insight lacking from these previous studies is the importance of the non-neural and preplacodal ectoderm, two critical precursors during inner ear development. Here we report the stepwise differentiation of inner ear sensory epithelia from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in three-dimensional culture. We show that by recapitulating in vivo development with precise temporal control of signalling pathways, ESC aggregates transform sequentially into non-neural, preplacodal and otic-placode-like epithelia. Notably, in a self-organized process that mimics normal development, vesicles containing prosensory cells emerge from the presumptive otic placodes and give rise to hair cells bearing stereocilia bundles and a kinocilium. Moreover, these stem-cell-derived hair cells exhibit functional properties of native mechanosensitive hair cells and form specialized synapses with sensory neurons that have also arisen from ESCs in the culture. Finally, we demonstrate how these vesicles are structurally and biochemically comparable to developing vestibular end organs. Our data thus establish a new in vitro model of inner ear differentiation that can be used to gain deeper insight into inner ear development and disorder."

https://openalex.org/W2009551722,"The new H7N9 influenza virus, recently emerged in China, can replicate in human airway cells and in the respiratory tract of ferrets to a higher level than can seasonal H3N2 virus and shows higher lethality in mice than genetically related H7N9 and H9N2 viruses, but shows limited transmission in ferrets by respiratory droplets. By 20 July 2013, there had been 134 laboratory-confirmed human cases of infection with avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection, including 43 deaths. Yoshihiro Kawaoka and colleagues characterize the biology of two recent isolates of the virus. They provide a wealth of data from infections in mice, pigs, macaques and ferrets. H7N9 virus is shown to be less sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors than pandemic H1N1 virus, but equally susceptible to an experimental polymerase inhibitor. Terrence Tumpey and colleagues determine the capacity of two clinical H7N9 isolates to cause disease and transmit between mammals. They show that the virus can replicate in human airway cells and in the respiratory tract of ferrets to a higher level than can seasonal H3N2 virus, and show higher lethality in mice than genetically related H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. In transmission studies, the H7N9 virus showed limited transmission in ferrets by respiratory droplets. Ron Fouchier and colleagues investigate the transmissibility of H7N9 virus between ferrets. They show that airborne transmission can occur, but inefficiently. They also show that on passage in ferrets, virus variants that have higher avian receptor binding, higher pH of fusion and lower thermostability are selected, and they suggest that these characteristics may result in reduced transmissibility. On 29 March 2013, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first reported case of human infection with an avian influenza A(H7N9) virus1. The recent human infections with H7N9 virus, totalling over 130 cases with 39 fatalities to date, have been characterized by severe pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)2. This is concerning because H7 viruses have typically been associated with ocular disease in humans, rather than severe respiratory disease3. This recent outbreak underscores the need to better understand the pathogenesis and transmission of these viruses in mammals. Here we assess the ability of A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) viruses, isolated from fatal human cases, to cause disease in mice and ferrets and to transmit to naive animals. Both H7N9 viruses replicated to higher titre in human airway epithelial cells and in the respiratory tract of ferrets compared to a seasonal H3N2 virus. Moreover, the H7N9 viruses showed greater infectivity and lethality in mice compared to genetically related H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H7N9 viruses were readily transmitted to naive ferrets through direct contact but, unlike the seasonal H3N2 virus, did not transmit readily by respiratory droplets. The lack of efficient respiratory droplet transmission was corroborated by low receptor-binding specificity for human-like α2,6-linked sialosides. Our results indicate that H7N9 viruses have the capacity for efficient replication in mammals and human airway cells and highlight the need for continued public health surveillance of this emerging virus."
https://openalex.org/W1994464752,"Unlike most salmonellae, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi causes life-threatening systemic infections known as typhoid fever, for which the molecular basis is unknown; here administration of typhoid toxin produced by S. Typhi reproduces many of the acute symptoms of typhoid fever, carbohydrates on cell surface glycoproteins are identified as receptors for typhoid toxin and the toxin’s crystal structure is determined, providing insights into these interactions. The biological basis for the pathogenic properties of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is largely unknown. S. Typhi causes life-threatening systemic infections known as typhoid fever, whereas most other Salmonella enterica serotypes are either harmless or associated with less-serious gastric infections or food poisoning. This study shows that administration of typhoid toxin, a novel AB toxin composed of two A subunits unique to S. Typhi, reproduces many of the acute symptoms of typhoid fever. The authors go on to identify carbohydrates on cell-surface glycoproteins as receptors for typhoid toxin and determine the toxin's crystal structure, providing insights into these interactions. Theses advances suggest that antitoxin-based therapeutics may be effective in treating typhoid. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) differs from most other salmonellae in that it causes a life-threatening systemic infection known as typhoid fever1. The molecular bases for its unique clinical presentation are unknown2. Here we find that the systemic administration of typhoid toxin, a unique virulence factor of S. Typhi, reproduces many of the acute symptoms of typhoid fever in an animal model. We identify specific carbohydrate moieties on specific surface glycoproteins that serve as receptors for typhoid toxin, which explains its broad cell target specificity. We present the atomic structure of typhoid toxin, which shows an unprecedented A2B5 organization with two covalently linked A subunits non-covalently associated to a pentameric B subunit. The structure provides insight into the toxin’s receptor-binding specificity and delivery mechanisms and reveals how the activities of two powerful toxins have been co-opted into a single, unique toxin that can induce many of the symptoms characteristic of typhoid fever. These findings may lead to the development of potentially life-saving therapeutics against typhoid fever."
https://openalex.org/W2025016146,"It is increasingly clear that systemic inflammation has both adaptive and deleterious effects on the brain. However, detailed comparisons of brain effects of systemic challenges with different pro-inflammatory cytokines are lacking. In the present study, we challenged female C57BL/6 mice intraperitoneally with LPS (100 µg/kg), IL-1β (15 or 50 µg/kg), TNF-α (50 or 250 µg/kg) or IL-6 (50 or 125 µg/kg). We investigated effects on core body temperature, open field activity and plasma levels of inflammatory markers at 2 hours post injection. We also examined levels of hepatic, hypothalamic and hippocampal inflammatory cytokine transcripts. Hypothermia and locomotor hypoactivity were induced by LPS>IL-1β>TNF-α>>IL-6. Systemic LPS, IL-1β and TNF-α challenges induced robust and broadly similar systemic and central inflammation compared to IL-6, which showed limited effects, but did induce a hepatic acute phase response. Important exceptions included IFNβ, which could only be induced by LPS. Systemic IL-1β could not induce significant blood TNF-α, but induced CNS TNF-α mRNA, while systemic TNF-α could induce IL-1β in blood and brain. Differences between IL-1β and TNF-α-induced hippocampal profiles, specifically for IL-6 and CXCL1 prompted a temporal analysis of systemic and central responses at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours, which revealed that IL-1β and TNF-α both induced the chemokines CXCL1 and CCL2 but only IL-1β induced the pentraxin PTX3. Expression of COX-2, CXCL1 and CCL2, with nuclear localisation of the p65 subunit of NFκB, in the cerebrovasculature was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we used cFOS immunohistochemistry to show that LPS, IL-1β and to a lesser degree, TNF-α activated the central nucleus of the amygdala. Given the increasing attention in the clinical literautre on correlating specific systemic inflammatory mediators with neurological or neuropsychiatric conditions and complications, these data will provide a useful resource on the likely CNS inflammatory profiles resulting from systemic elevation of particular cytokines."

https://openalex.org/W2056786696,"Given the frequent use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) around the world, the study of traumatic blast injuries is of increasing interest. The ear is the most common organ affected by blast injury because it is the body's most sensitive pressure transducer. We fabricated a blast chamber to re-create blast profiles similar to that of IEDs and used it to develop a reproducible mouse model to study blast-induced hearing loss. The tympanic membrane was perforated in all mice after blast exposure and found to heal spontaneously. Micro-computed tomography demonstrated no evidence for middle ear or otic capsule injuries; however, the healed tympanic membrane was thickened. Auditory brainstem response and distortion product otoacoustic emission threshold shifts were found to be correlated with blast intensity. As well, these threshold shifts were larger than those found in control mice that underwent surgical perforation of their tympanic membranes, indicating cochlear trauma. Histological studies one week and three months after the blast demonstrated no disruption or damage to the intra-cochlear membranes. However, there was loss of outer hair cells (OHCs) within the basal turn of the cochlea and decreased spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and afferent nerve synapses. Using our mouse model that recapitulates human IED exposure, our results identify that the mechanisms underlying blast-induced hearing loss does not include gross membranous rupture as is commonly believed. Instead, there is both OHC and SGN loss that produce auditory dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2059616389,"The main purpose of this study was to directly quantify the relative contribution of Ca2+ cycling to resting metabolic rate in mouse fast (extensor digitorum longus, EDL) and slow (soleus) twitch skeletal muscle. Resting oxygen consumption of isolated muscles (VO2, µL/g wet weight/s) measured polarographically at 30°C was ~20% higher (P<0.05) in soleus (0.326 ± 0.022) than in EDL (0.261 ± 0.020). In order to quantify the specific contribution of Ca2+ cycling to resting metabolic rate, the concentration of MgCl2 in the bath was increased to 10 mM to block Ca2+ release through the ryanodine receptor, thus eliminating a major source of Ca2+ leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and thereby indirectly inhibiting the activity of the sarco(endo) plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (SERCAs). The relative (%) reduction in muscle VO2 in response to 10 mM MgCl2 was similar between soleus (48.0±3.7) and EDL (42.4±3.2). Using a different approach, we attempted to directly inhibit SERCA ATPase activity in stretched EDL and soleus muscles (1.42x optimum length) using the specific SERCA inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (CPA, up to 160 µM), but were unsuccessful in removing the energetic cost of Ca2+ cycling in resting isolated muscles. The results of the MgCl2 experiments indicate that ATP consumption by SERCAs is responsible for 40–50% of resting metabolic rate in both mouse fast- and slow-twitch muscles at 30°C, or 12–15% of whole body resting VO2. Thus, SERCA pumps in skeletal muscle could represent an important control point for energy balance regulation and a potential target for metabolic alterations to oppose obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1985966332,"Olfactory receptors (ORs) are G protein-coupled receptors that detect odorants in the olfactory epithelium, and comprise the largest gene family in the genome. Identification of OR ligands typically requires OR surface expression in heterologous cells; however, ORs rarely traffic to the cell surface when exogenously expressed. Therefore, most ORs are orphan receptors with no known ligands. To date, studies have utilized non-cleavable rhodopsin (Rho) tags and/or chaperones (i.e. Receptor Transporting Protein, RTP1S, Ric8b and G(αolf)) to improve surface expression. However, even with these tools, many ORs still fail to reach the cell surface. We used a test set of fifteen ORs to examine the effect of a cleavable leucine-rich signal peptide sequence (Lucy tag) on OR surface expression in HEK293T cells. We report here that the addition of the Lucy tag to the N-terminus increases the number of ORs reaching the cell surface to 7 of the 15 ORs (as compared to 3/15 without Rho or Lucy tags). Moreover, when ORs tagged with both Lucy and Rho were co-expressed with previously reported chaperones (RTP1S, Ric8b and G(αolf)), we observed surface expression for all 15 receptors examined. In fact, two-thirds of Lucy-tagged ORs are able to reach the cell surface synergistically with chaperones even when the Rho tag is removed (10/15 ORs), allowing for the potential assessment of OR function with only an 8-amino acid Flag tag on the mature protein. As expected for a signal peptide, the Lucy tag was cleaved from the mature protein and did not alter OR-ligand binding and signaling. Our studies demonstrate that widespread surface expression of ORs can be achieved in HEK293T cells, providing promise for future large-scale deorphanization studies."
https://openalex.org/W1924315749,"Commercially available angiotensin II AT2 receptor antibodies are widely employed for receptor localization and quantification, but they have not been adequately validated. In this study, we characterized three commercially available AT2 receptor antibodies: 2818-1 from Epitomics, sc-9040 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and AAR-012 from Alomone Labs. Using western blot analysis the immunostaining patterns observed were different for every antibody tested, and in most cases consisted of multiple immunoreactive bands. Identical immunoreactive patterns were present in wild-type and AT2 receptor knockout mice not expressing the target protein. In the mouse brain, immunocytochemical studies revealed very different cellular immunoreactivity for each antibody tested. While the 2818-1 antibody reacted only with endothelial cells in small parenchymal arteries, the sc-9040 antibody reacted only with ependymal cells lining the cerebral ventricles, and the AAR-012 antibody reacted only with multiple neuronal cell bodies in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, the immunoreactivities were identical in brain tissue from wild-type or AT2 receptor knockout mice. Furthermore, in both mice and rat tissue extracts, there was no correlation between the observed immunoreactivity and the presence or absence of AT2 receptor binding or gene expression. We conclude that none of these commercially available AT2 receptor antibodies tested met the criteria for specificity. In the absence of full antibody characterization, competitive radioligand binding and determination of mRNA expression remain the only reliable approaches to study AT2 receptor expression."
https://openalex.org/W2078072567,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays an important role in corneal epithelial migration and proliferation to improve the wound healing process. This study aimed to understand the role of NFκB in EGF-induced corneal epithelial wound healing through regulation of CTCF activity, which plays important roles in cell motility and migration to promote wound healing. The effect of NFκB p50 on corneal epithelial wound healing was investigated by comparing the eyes of wild-type and p50 knockout mice. We found that there was a significant retardation in corneal epithelial wound healing in the corneas of p50 knockout mice. Wound closure rates were measured in human corneal epithelial cells transfected with an NFκB activation-sensitive CTCF expression construct to demonstrate the effect of human CTCF expression under the control of EGF-induced NFκB activation on wound healing. EGF stimulation activated NFκB, which directly triggered the expression of the exogenous human CTCF in transfected cells and, subsequently, promoted human corneal epithelial cell motility, migration, and wound healing. Overexpression of CTCF in corneal epithelial cells and mouse corneas significantly enhanced the wound healing process. Furthermore, the effect of overexpressing NFκB p50 in corneal epithelial cells on the promotion of wound healing was abolished by knockdown of CTCF with CTCF-specific shRNA. Thus, a direct regulatory relationship between EGF-induced NFκB p50 and CTCF activation affecting corneal epithelial wound healing has been established, indicating that CTCF is, indeed, a NFκB p50-targeted and effective gene product in the core transcriptional network downstream from the growth factor-induced NFκB signaling pathway.Background: We study NF-κB-activated CTCF in EGF-induced wound healing.Results: Corneal epithelial wound healing was significantly impaired because of the lack of CTCF activity in NFκB-p50−/− mice.

In corneal epithelial cells, EGF-induced activation of the NF-κB pathway regulates cell fate in a subtype-specific fashion through interactions with CTCF that function as a downstream component in the core transcriptional network (14.Lu L.

As previously described, EGF is an important growth factor in corneal epithelial wound healing. It facilitates corneal epithelial wound repair by promoting migration and proliferation in both in vivo and in vitro model systems (1.Lu L. Reinach P.S. Kao W.W. Corneal epithelial wound healing.Exp.

The question that remains to be answered is whether CTCF is one of the key factors that directly switch EGF-induced activation of NF-κB signaling to genetic responses that subsequently change corneal epithelial cell stages, resulting in the acceleration of wound healing. On the corneal surface, corneal epithelial wound healing requires proper activities of cell migration that are essential for successful re-epithelialization in the process of corneal epithelial self-renewal (1.Lu L. Reinach P.S. Kao W.W. Corneal epithelial wound healing.Exp. Biol. Med. 2001; 226: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that EGF-induced CTCF activation accelerates corneal epithelial cell migration, which is favorable for wound healing and tissue repair in the cornea (15.Li T. Lu L.

However, the results obtained for EGF-induced NFκB subtype activation are sometimes contradictory, and the role of CTCF in corneal epithelial wound healing remains unclear. This study aimed to advance our understanding of how the EGF-induced NFκB subtype p50 directly activates CTCF to increase cell motility and migration in human corneal epithelial cells to promote corneal epithelial wound healing. We further revealed an EGF-induced activation of the NFκB p50 subtype that interacts with CTCF in the promoter region, resulting in the activation of CTCF and facilitating corneal epithelial wound healing. NF-κB p50 knockout transgenic mice (NF-κB 1−/−) and wild-type mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), and genotypes of these mice were confirmed by PCR analysis from prepared tail DNA. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the institutional guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee according to National Institutes of Health guidelines. Human telomerase-immortalized corneal epithelial (HTCE) cells were cultured in a keratinocyte serum-free medium containing 120 μm calcium and supplemented with 0.4% bovine pituitary extract and 0.2 ng/ml EGF (Invitrogen). Human SV-40 large T-transformed corneal epithelial (HCE) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 μg/ml insulin. Cells were cultured in an incubator supplied with 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Culture media were replaced every 2 days, and cells were subcultured by treatment with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. For EGF-induced experiments, cells were synchronized in growth factor-deprived medium for 24–48 h before EGF stimulation. Full-length cDNA encoding human p50 was cloned into the pcDNA4-to-A vector (Invitrogen), named pcDNA4-p50. Both the pcDNA4-p50 construct and the pcDNA4-to-A vector (control) were transfected into HTCE cells by FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche) for wound healing assays and Western blot analysis. For the experiments knocking down cellular NF-κB p50, p50-specific siRNA (GGGGCUAUAAUCCUGG-ACU (sense) and AGUCCAGGAUUAU-AGCCCC (antisense)) and control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were transfected into HCE cells that were subject to wound healing assays and Western blot analysis. Lentiviral particles containing shRNA of CTCF tagged with a variant of green fluorescent protein (Turbo-GFP, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were packaged in HEK-293T cells (17.Wang L. Deng S.X. Lu L. Role of CTCF in EGF-induced migration of immortalized human corneal epithelial cells.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2012; 53: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The viral concentrations in the culture medium were titrated by PCR after cotransfection of HTCE cells with pCMV-VSV-G, psPAX2, and pGIPZshRNA-CTCF fused to the GFP for 72 h (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL). The culture medium containing the lentiviral particles secreted from HEK-293T cells was added to HTCE cells, and infected clones stably expressing shRNAs were selected in selective culture with puromycin (2 μg/ml). HTCE cells infected with a pGIPZ-shRNA-control vector packed in the lentivirus served as controls. In addition, expression of GFP from the pGIPZ-TurboGFP vector allowed measuring of the efficiency of the viral infection and distinguishing green from non-green cells. The green cells integrated with shRNA were visualized by fluorescence microscope (Nikon). For corneal wound healing studies, the cDNA encoding the full-length CTCF gene were introduced into a linearized Adeno-x-vector using the In-Fusion HD cloning system (Clontech). The recombinant adenovirus was packaged in HEK293 cells and amplified by transfecting PacI-digested vectors. The viral titer of 109 plaque-forming units was obtained from crude viral lysates. The recombinant adenoviruses Adeno-x-vector (for controls) or Adeno-x-CTCF were added to the culture medium at 2.5 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml. After 5 days of incubation, the eyeballs were transferred to a new dish containing normal defined keratinocyte serum-free (KSF) medium without virus and incubated for additional 10–15 days. The medium was changed every other day and photographed with a Nikon fluorescent microscope. The wound area was calculated with Nikon Tis NIS-Elements software. NF-κB transcription response element (TREs) sties were inserted in five repeats upstream of the mini-CMV promoter followed by GFP or GFP plus full-length human CTCF cDNAs. The constructs were termed TRE-Control and TRE-CTCF, respectively. GFP served as a reporter of NF-κB activity. Lentiviral particles that contained NF-κB TRE-Control or TRE-CTCF were cotransfected with pCMV-VSV-G and psPAX2 into HEK-293T cells for packaging. The culture medium containing a high titer of lentivirus secreted from HEK-293T cells was collected and added to HTCE cells. All clones that were integrated with TRE-Control or TRE-CTCF were selected for 4 weeks by adding puromycin (2 μg/ml) to the culture medium to establish stable expression cell lines. Two wound healing assays were performed, including corneal wound healing in cultured whole-eye organ and a scratch-induced directional wound-healing assay. The corneas in cultured whole-eye organs were used for experiments of corneal epithelial wound healing. Under a dissecting microscope, the surface layer of the mouse corneas was debrided without damaging the basement membrane of the corneal epithelia using a corneal rust ring remover with a 0.5-mm burr (Algerbrush, The Alger Company, Inc., Lago Vista, TX). The whole eyeball was dissected and placed in culture wells (the corneas facing up) with the medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. The rate of epithelial healing in whole-eye organ culture was measured immediately after wounding. Eyeballs were taken from wild-type or NF-κB p50 knockout mice and allowed to heal under culture conditions. Lesions of the corneas were stained topically with fluorescein (fluorescein sodium 1.0% w/v) and photographed with an inverted microscope (Nikon). The corneal epithelial layer was removed in an area of 1.5-mm diameter (or 2-mm diameter for Ad-x-CTCF transduction assays) near the central cornea. Wounded corneas were incubated for 1–2 days under normal and EGF-induced conditions and up to 15 days in the absence of FBS and EGF. All animals used in our experiments were treated in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research using protocols approved and monitored by the LABioMed Animal Care Committee at the University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine. Corneal epithelial cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates and grown to 100% confluence. A cross-stripe scratch wound was made on the cell surface with a yellow micropipette tip. The wound area was measured by calculating the average values at multiple points (at least 10 points/wound along the edges) using commercial software (NIS-Element, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and photographed with an inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti, Nikon) during the healing period. The microscope was able to record exactly the same area at each time point by memorizing the x-y directions through a computer-controlled and motorized head stage. The width of the wounded area was measured, and the rate of wound closure was calculated using the units of micrometers/hour. The cell migration assay was performed following the instructions of the manufacturer (Transwell, Corning Inc., Corning, NY). The migration chamber culture insert contained a polyethylene terephthalate membrane 6.5 mm in diameter with an 8-μm pore size. HTCE cells expressing NF-κB TRE-CTCF or TRE-Control (5 × 104) were seeded in the culture insert (upper chamber) with plain medium and incubated for 24 h. EGF (20 ng/ml) or the sham was added to the culture insert, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. Migrated cells that grew on the culture well (bottom chamber) were counted and photographed with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon). The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with 0.3% crystal violet, and photographed. The dye in the cells was then dissolved in 10% acetic acid, and the absorbance of the dissolved dye was measured at a wavelength of 600 nm. The Motility of HTCE cells expressing NF-κB TRE-CTCF and TRE-Control was measured using an inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti, Nikon) with the following functions: time-lapse videos of the phase contrast/fluorescent live images, built-in total internal reflection fluorescence and FRET, perfect focus system, and a digital charge-coupled device (CCD) camera at a time interval of 2 min for each photo. The system was equipped with a heated chamber at 37 °C and flushed with mixed 5% CO2 that kept the cells under normal culture conditions. Live cells were recorded for a period of 0.5–3 h. Cell motility was examined by tracking cell movements and distances (millimeters/hour) using an inverted microscope with a motorized head stage and software (Tis NIS-Elements, Nikon). Immunocytochemistry experiments were performed following a protocol as described previously (36.Wang L. Payton R. Dai W. Lu L. Hyperosmotic stress-induced ATF-2 activation through Polo-like kinase 3 in human corneal epithelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1951-1958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse eyeballs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned into 8-μm sections. The tissue section was perforated with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBS-T). After being blocked with 2% BSA and 5% normal serum in PBS-T, the sections were incubated with primary antibody against CTCF (Millipore) in 1% BSA-0.1% Triton X-100-PBS for 16 h at 4 °C. Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody was applied in 1% BSA- 0.1% Triton X-100-PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Stained tissues were mounted with shield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc.) and photographed using the Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope with a ×60 oil total internal reflection fluorescence lens. Western blot analyses were performed by lysing corneal epithelial cells (2 × 105) in SDS sample buffer that contained 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm DTT, and 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue. Proteins in the lysates were denatured by boiling for 5 min and being size-fractionated in 8–10% PAGE gels. Proteins in PAGE gels were electrotransferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) by using a semidry gel transferring apparatus (Bio-Rad, CA). The PVDF membranes were exposed to the blocking buffer containing 5% nonfat milk in TBS and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at 22 °C and then incubated with the respective primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was applied in TBS-T buffer for 1 h at 22 °C. Western blot analyses were developed by an ECL Plus system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized by exposure to x-ray films. Recent reports demonstrate that corneal epithelial wound healing is affected by a deficiency of IκB (in the NF-κB pathway) in the eyes of IκB knockout mice (37.Chen L. Meng Q. Kao W. Xia Y. IκB kinase β regulates epithelium migration during corneal wound healing.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e16132Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Googl"
https://openalex.org/W2030409371,"The analysis of mutualistic networks has become a central tool in answering theoretical and applied questions regarding our understanding of ecological processes. Significant gaps in knowledge do however need to be bridged in order to effectively and accurately be able to describe networks. Main concern are the incorporation of species level information, accounting for sampling limitations and understanding linkage rules. Here I propose a simple method to combine plant pollinator effort-limited sampling with information about plant community to gain understanding of what drives linkage rules, while accounting for possible undetected linkages. I use hierarchical models to estimate the probability of detection of each plant-pollinator interaction in 12 Mediterranean plant-pollinator networks. As it is possible to incorporate plant traits as co-variables in the models, this method has the potential to be used for predictive purposes, such as identifying undetected links among existing species, as well as potential interactions with new plant species. Results show that pollinator detectability is very skewed and usually low. Nevertheless, 84% of the models are enhanced by the inclusion of co-variables, with flower abundance and inflorescence type being the most commonly retained co-variables. The predicted networks increase network Connectance by 13%, but not Nestedness, which is known to be robust to sampling effects. However, 46% of the pollinator interactions in the studied networks comprised a single observation and hence could not be modeled. The hierarchical modeling approach suggested here is highly flexible and can be used on binary or frequency networks, accommodate different observers or include collection day weather variables as confounding factors. An R script is provided for a rapid adoption of this method."
https://openalex.org/W2060544572,"Background Intestinal barrier failure may lead to systemic inflammation and distant organ injury in patients following severe injury. Enteric glia cells (EGCs) have been shown to play an important role in maintaining gut barrier integrity through secretion of S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). We have recently shown than Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS) increases EGC activation, which was associated with improved gut barrier integrity. Thus, we sought to further study the mechanism by which EGCs prevent intestinal barrier breakdown utilizing an in vitro model. We postulated that EGCs, through the secretion of GSNO, would improve intestinal barrier function through improved expression and localization of intestinal tight junction proteins. Methods Epithelial cells were co-cultured with EGCs or incubated with GSNO and exposed to Cytomix (TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-1β) for 24 hours. Barrier function was assessed by permeability to 4kDa FITC-Dextran. Changes in tight junction proteins ZO-1, occludin, and phospho-MLC (P-MLC) were assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot. Key Results Co-culture of Cytomix-stimulated epithelial monolayers with EGCs prevented increases in permeability and improved expression and localization of occludin, ZO-1, and P-MLC. Further, treatment of epithelial monolayers with GSNO also prevented Cytomix-induced increases in permeability and exhibited a similar improvement in expression and localization of occludin, ZO-1, and P-MLC. Conclusions & Inferences The addition of EGCs, or their secreted mediator GSNO, prevents epithelial barrier failure after injury and improved expression of tight junction proteins. Thus, therapies that increase EGC activation, such as VNS, may be a novel strategy to limit barrier failure in patients following severe injury."
https://openalex.org/W2164076172,"Mutants created by deleting the ddrA, ddrB, ddrC, ddrD, and pprA loci of Deinococcus radiodurans R1alone and in all possible combinations of pairs revealed that the encoded gene products contribute to this species' resistance to UV light and/or mitomycin C. Deleting pprA from an otherwise wild type cell sensitizes the resulting strain to UV irradiation, reducing viability by as much as eight fold relative to R1. If this deletion is introduced into a ΔddrA or ΔddrD background, the resulting strains become profoundly sensitive to the lethal effects of UV light. At a fluence of 1000 Jm⁻², the ΔddrA ΔpprA and ΔddrD ΔpprA strains are 100- and 1000-fold more sensitive to UV relative to the strain that has only lost pprA. Deletion of ddrA results in a 100 fold increase in strain sensitivity to mitomycin C, but in backgrounds that combine a deletion of ddrA with deletions of either ddrC or ddrD, mitomycin resistance is restored to wild type levels. Inactivation of ddrB also increases D. radiodurans sensitivity to mitomycin, but unlike the ddrA mutant deleting ddrC or ddrD from a ΔddrB background further increases that sensitivity. Despite the effect that loss of these gene products has on DNA damage resistance, none appear to directly affect either excision repair or homologous recombination suggesting that they participate in novel processes that facilitate tolerance to UV light and interstrand crosslinks in this species."
https://openalex.org/W2076243163,"Nuclear export and translation of intron-containing viral mRNAs are required for HIV-1 gene expression and replication. In this report, we provide evidence to show that DDX3 regulates the translation of HIV-1 mRNAs. We found that knockdown of DDX3 expression effectively inhibited HIV-1 production. Translation of HIV-1 early regulatory proteins, Tat and rev, was impaired in DDX3-depleted cells. All HIV-1 transcripts share a highly structured 5’ untranslated region (UTR) with inhibitory elements on translation of viral mRNAs, yet DDX3 promoted translation of reporter mRNAs containing the HIV-1 5’ UTR, especially with the transactivation response (TAR) hairpin. Interestingly, DDX3 directly interacts with HIV-1 Tat, a well-characterized transcriptional activator bound to the TAR hairpin. HIV-1 Tat is partially targeted to cytoplasmic stress granules upon DDX3 overexpression or cell stress conditions, suggesting a potential role of Tat/DDX3 complex in translation. We further demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat remains associated with translating mRNAs and facilitates translation of mRNAs containing the HIV-1 5’ UTR. Taken together, these findings indicate that DDX3 is recruited to the TAR hairpin by interaction with viral Tat to facilitate HIV-1 mRNA translation."
https://openalex.org/W2125222853,"Aedes albopictus, a vector of Dengue and Chikungunya viruses, is a robust invasive species in both tropical and temperate environments. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression and biological processes including embryonic development, innate immunity and infection. While a number of miRNAs have been discovered in some mosquitoes, no comprehensive effort has been made to characterize them from different developmental stages from a single species. Systematic analysis of miRNAs in Ae. albopictus will improve our understanding of its basic biology and inform novel strategies to prevent virus transmission. Between 10–14 million Illumina sequencing reads per sample were obtained from embryos, larvae, pupae, adult males, sugar-fed and blood-fed adult females. A total of 119 miRNA genes represented by 215 miRNA or miRNA star (miRNA*) sequences were identified, 15 of which are novel. Eleven, two, and two of the newly-discovered miRNA genes appear specific to Aedes, Culicinae, and Culicidae, respectively. A number of miRNAs accumulate predominantly in one or two developmental stages and the large number that showed differences in abundance following a blood meal likely are important in blood-induced mosquito biology. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the targets of all Ae. albopictus miRNAs provides a useful starting point for the study of their functions in mosquitoes. This study is the first systematic analysis of miRNAs based on deep-sequencing of small RNA samples of all developmental stages of a mosquito species. A number of miRNAs are related to specific physiological states, most notably, pre- and post-blood feeding. The distribution of lineage-specific miRNAs is consistent with mosquito phylogeny and the presence of a number of Aedes-specific miRNAs likely reflects the divergence between the Aedes and Culex genera."
https://openalex.org/W1972412759,"In studies of consistent individual differences (personality) along the bold-shy continuum, a pattern of behavioral correlations frequently emerges: individuals towards the bold end of the continuum are more likely to utilize risky habitat, approach potential predators, and feed under risky conditions. Here, we address the hypothesis that observed phenotypic correlations among component behaviors of the bold-shy continuum are a result of underlying genetic correlations (quantitative genetic architecture). We used a replicated three-generation pedigree of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to study three putative components of the bold-shy continuum: horizontal position, swim level, and feeding latency. We detected significant narrow-sense heritabilities as well as significant genetic and phenotypic correlations among all three behaviors, such that fish selected for swimming at the front of the tank swam closer to the observer, swam higher in the water column, and fed more quickly than fish selected for swimming at the back of the tank. Further, the lines varied in their initial open field behavior (swim level and activity level). The quantitative genetic architecture of the bold-shy continuum indicates that the multivariate behavioral phenotype characteristic of a “bold” personality type may be a result of correlated evolution via underlying genetic correlations."
https://openalex.org/W1995294620,"Methionine, folic acid, betaine and choline interact in the one-carbon metabolism which provides methyl groups for methylation reactions. An optimal intake of these nutrients during pregnancy is required for successful completion of fetal development and evidence is growing that they could be involved in metabolic long-term programming. However, the biological pathways involved in the action of these nutrients are still poorly known. This study investigated the interaction between methyl donors and protein content in maternal diet during the preconceptual, pregnancy and lactation periods and the consequences on the rat offspring in the short and long term. Methyl donor supplementation reduced leptin secretion in offspring, whereas insulin levels were mostly affected by protein restriction. The joint effect of protein restriction and methyl donor excess strongly impaired postnatal growth in both gender and long term weight gain in male offspring only, without affecting food intake. In addition, rats born from protein restricted and methyl donor supplemented dams gained less weight when fed a hypercaloric diet. Methylation of the leptin gene promoter in adipose tissue was increased in methyl donor supplemented groups but not affected by protein restriction only. These results suggest that maternal methyl donor supplementation may influence energy homeostasis in a gender-dependent manner, without affecting food intake. Moreover, we showed that macronutrients and micronutrients in maternal diet interact to influence the programming of the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2044629601,"Salinomycin is used as an antibiotic in animal husbandry. Its implication in cancer therapy has recently been proposed. Present study evaluated the toxic effects of Salinomycin on male reproductive system of mice. Doses of 1, 3 or 5 mg/kg of Salinomycin were administered daily for 28 days. Half of the mice were sacrificed after 24 h of the last treatment and other half were sacrificed 28 days after withdrawal of treatment. Effects of SAL on body and reproductive organ weights were studied. Histoarchitecture of testis and epididymis was evaluated along with ultrastructural changes in Leydig cells. Serum and testicular testosterone and luteinizing hormones were estimated. Superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, lipid peroxidation, catalase and lactate dehydrogenase activities were measured. Spermatozoa count, morphology, motility and fertility were evaluated. Expression patterns of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage proteins (CYP11A1) were assessed by Western blotting. Salinomycin treatment was lethal to few mice and retarded body growth in others with decreased weight of testes and seminal vesicles in a dose dependent manner. Seminiferous tubules in testes were disrupted and the epithelium of epididymis showed frequent occurrence of vacuolization and necrosis. Leydig cells showed hypertrophied cytoplasm with shrunken nuclei, condensed mitochondria, proliferated endoplasmic reticulum and increased number of lipid droplets. Salinomycin decreased motility and spermatozoa count with increased number of abnormal spermatozoa leading to infertility. The testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels were decreased in testis but increased in serum at higher doses. Depletion of superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione with increased lipid peroxidation in both testis and epididymis indicated generation of oxidative stress. Suppressed expression of StAR and CYP11A1 proteins indicates inhibition of steroidogenesis. Spermatogenesis was however observed in testis 28 days after Salinomycin withdrawal. The results indicate reversible dose-dependent adverse effects of Salinomycin on male reproductive system of mice."
https://openalex.org/W2056906927,"GABA(B) receptors are the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) for GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Native GABA(B) receptors comprise principle and auxiliary subunits that regulate receptor properties in distinct ways. The principle subunits GABA(B1a), GABA(B1b), and GABA(B2) form fully functional heteromeric GABA(B(1a,2)) and GABA(B(1b,2)) receptors. Principal subunits regulate forward trafficking of the receptors from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane and control receptor distribution to axons and dendrites. The auxiliary subunits KCTD8, -12, -12b, and -16 are cytosolic proteins that influence agonist potency and G-protein signaling of GABA(B(1a,2)) and GABA(B(1b,2)) receptors. Here, we used transfected cells to study assembly, surface trafficking, and internalization of GABA(B) receptors in the presence of the KCTD12 subunit. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation and metabolic labeling, we show that GABA(B) receptors associate with KCTD12 while they reside in the endoplasmic reticulum. Glycosylation experiments support that association with KCTD12 does not influence maturation of the receptor complex. Immunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments demonstrate that KCTD12 remains associated with the receptor during receptor activity and receptor internalization from the cell surface. We further show that KCTD12 reduces constitutive receptor internalization and thereby increases the magnitude of receptor signaling at the cell surface. Accordingly, knock-out or knockdown of KCTD12 in cultured hippocampal neurons reduces the magnitude of the GABA(B) receptor-mediated K(+) current response. In summary, our experiments support that the up-regulation of functional GABA(B) receptors at the neuronal plasma membrane is an additional physiological role of the auxiliary subunit KCTD12."
https://openalex.org/W1964791395,"The methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, is an important organism used for the production of therapeutic proteins. However, the presence of fungal-like glycans, either N-linked or O-linked, can elicit an immune response or enable the expressed protein to bind to mannose receptors, thus reducing their efficacy. Previously we have reported the elimination of β-linked glycans in this organism. In the current report we have focused on reducing the O-linked mannose content of proteins produced in P. pastoris, thereby reducing the potential to bind to mannose receptors. The initial step in the synthesis of O-linked glycans in P. pastoris is the transfer of mannose from dolichol-phosphomannose to a target protein in the yeast secretory pathway by members of the protein-O-mannosyltransferase (PMT) family. In this report we identify and characterize the members of the P. pastoris PMT family. Like Candida albicans, P. pastoris has five PMT genes. Based on sequence homology, these PMTs can be grouped into three sub-families, with both PMT1 and PMT2 sub-families possessing two members each (PMT1 and PMT5, and PMT2 and PMT6, respectively). The remaining sub-family, PMT4, has only one member (PMT4). Through gene knockouts we show that PMT1 and PMT2 each play a significant role in O-glycosylation. Both, by gene knockouts and the use of Pmt inhibitors we were able to significantly reduce not only the degree of O-mannosylation, but also the chain-length of these glycans. Taken together, this reduction of O-glycosylation represents an important step forward in developing the P. pastoris platform as a suitable system for the production of therapeutic glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2164453459,"In recent years, the uptake of assisted reproductive techniques such as in vitro fertilisation has risen exponentially. However, there is much that is still not fully understood about the biochemical modifications that take place during the development and maturation of the oocyte. As such, it is essential to further the understanding of how oocyte manipulation during these procedures ultimately affects its developmental potential; yet, there are few methods currently available which are capable of providing a quantitative measure of oocyte quality. Raman spectroscopy enables investigation of the global biochemical profile of intact cells without the need for labelling. Here, Raman spectra were acquired from the ooplasm of mouse oocytes at various stages of development, from late pre-antral follicles, collected after in vitro maturation within their ovarian follicles and from unstimulated and stimulated ovulatory cycles. Using a combination of univariate and multivariate statistical methods, it was found that ooplasm lipid content could be used to discriminate between different stages of oocyte development. Furthermore, the spectral profiles of mature oocytes revealed that oocytes which have developed in vitro are protein-deficient when compared to in vivo grown oocytes. Finally, the ratio of two Raman peak intensities, namely 1605∶1447 cm−1, used as a proxy for the protein-to-lipid ratio of the ooplasm, was shown to be indicative of the oocyte’s quality. Together, results indicate that Raman spectroscopy may present an alternative analytical tool for investigating the biochemistry of oocyte developmental stage and quality."
https://openalex.org/W2037621262,"The Notch signaling pathway controls diverse cell-fate specification events throughout development. The versatility of this pathway to influence different aspects of development comes from its multiple levels of regulation. Upon ligand-induced Notch activation, the Notch intracellular domain (Notch-ICD) is released from the membrane and translocates to the nucleus, where it transduces Notch signals by regulating the transcription of downstream target genes. But the exact mechanism of translocation of Notch-ICD into the nucleus is not clear. Here, we implicate Importin-α3 (also known as karyopherin-α3) in the nuclear translocation of Notch-ICD in Drosophila. Our present analyses reveal that Importin-α3 can directly bind to Notch-ICD and loss of Importin-α3 function results in cytoplasmic accumulation of the Notch receptor. Using MARCM (Mosaic Analysis with a Repressible Cell Marker) technique, we demonstrate that Importin-α3 is required for nuclear localization of Notch-ICD. These results reveal that the nuclear transport of Notch-ICD is mediated by the canonical Importin-α3/Importin-β transport pathway. In addition, co-expression of both Notch-ICD and Importin-α3 displays synergistic effects on cell proliferation. Taken together, our results suggest that Importin-α3 mediated nuclear import of Notch-ICD may play important role in regulation of Notch signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2004651646,"Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remains the main cause of postneonatal infant death. Thermal stress is a major risk factor and makes infants more vulnerable to SIDS. Although it has been suggested that thermal stress could lead to SIDS by disrupting autonomic functions, clinical and physiopathological data on this hypothesis are scarce. We evaluated the influence of ambient temperature on autonomic nervous activity during sleep in thirty-four preterm neonates (mean ± SD gestational age: 31.4±1.5 weeks, postmenstrual age: 36.2±0.9 weeks). Heart rate variability was assessed as a function of the sleep stage at three different ambient temperatures (thermoneutrality and warm and cool thermal conditions). An elevated ambient temperature was associated with a higher basal heart rate and lower short- and long-term variability in all sleep stages, together with higher sympathetic activity and lower parasympathetic activity. Our study results showed that modification of the ambient temperature led to significant changes in autonomic nervous system control in sleeping preterm neonates. The latter changes are very similar to those observed in infants at risk of SIDS. Our findings may provide greater insight into the thermally-induced disease mechanisms related to SIDS and may help improve prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2038799833,"CDK-cyclin complexes regulate centriole duplication and microtubule nucleation at specific cell cycle stages, although their exact roles in these processes remain unclear. As the activities of CDK-cyclins are themselves positively regulated by CDC25 phosphatases, we investigated the role of centrosomal CDC25B during interphase. We report that overexpression of CDC25B, as is commonly found in human cancer, results in a significant increase in centrin 2 at the centrosomes of interphase cells. Conversely, CDC25B depletion causes a loss of centrin 2 from the centrosome, which can be rescued by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. CDC25B overexpression also promotes the formation of excess centrin 2 “foci”. These foci can accumulate other centrosome proteins, including γ-tubulin and PCM-1, and can function as microtubule organising centres, indicating that these represent functional centrosomes. Formation of centrin 2 foci can be blocked by specific inhibition of CDK2 but not CDK1. CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of Monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) at the G1/S transition is essential for the initiation of centrosome duplication, and Mps1 is reported to phosphorylate centrin 2. Overexpression of wild-type or non-degradable Mps1 exacerbated the formation of excess centrin 2 foci induced by CDC25B overexpression, while kinase-dead Mps1 has a protective effect. Together, our data suggest that CDC25B, through activation of a centrosomal pool of CDK2, stabilises the local pool of Mps1 which in turn regulates the level of centrin 2 at the centrosome. Overexpression of CDC25B may therefore contribute to tumourigenesis by perturbing the natural turnover of centrosome proteins such as Mps1 and centrin 2, thus resulting in the de novo assembly of extra-numerary centrosomes and potentiating chromosome instability."
https://openalex.org/W2031173942,"Background The mechanisms by which tracheal occlusion (TO) improves alveolarization in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) are incompletely understood. Therefore transcriptional and histological effects of TO on alveolarization were studied in the rabbit model for CDH. The question of the best normalization strategy for gene expression analysis was also addressed. Methods Fetal rabbits were randomized for CDH or sham operation on gestational day 23/31 and for TO or sham operation on day 28/31 resulting in four study groups. Untouched littermates were added. At term and before lung harvest, fetuses were subjected to mechanical ventilation or not. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on lungs from 4–5 fetuses of each group with and without previous ventilation. Stability of ten housekeeping genes (HKGs) and optimal number of HKGs for normalization were determined, followed by assessment of HKG expression levels. Expression levels of eleven target genes were studied in ventilated lungs, including genes regulating elastogenesis, cell-environment interactions, and thinning of alveolar walls. Elastic staining, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting completed gene analysis. Results Regarding HKG expression, TO increased β-actin and β-subunit of ATP synthase. Mechanical ventilation increased β-actin and β2-microglobulin. Flavoprotein subunit of succinate dehydrogenase and DNA topoisomerase were the most stable HKGs. CDH lungs showed disorganized elastin deposition with lower levels for tropoelastin, fibulin-5, tenascin-C, and α6-integrin. After TO, CDH lungs displayed a normal pattern of elastin distribution with increased levels for tropoelastin, fibulin-5, tenascin-C, α6-integrin, ß1-integrin, lysyl oxidase, and drebrin. TO increased transcription and immunoreactivity of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1. Conclusions Experimental TO might improve alveolarization through the mechanoregulation of crucial genes for late lung development. However part of the transcriptional changes involved genes that were not affected in CDH, raising the question of TO-induced disturbances of alveolar remodeling. Attention should also be paid to selection of HKGs for studies on mechanotransduction-mediated gene expressions."
https://openalex.org/W2037193312,"The widely conserved ω subunit encoded by rpoZ is the smallest subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) but is dispensable for bacterial growth. Function of ω is known to be substituted by GroEL in ω-null strain, which thus does not exhibit a discernable phenotype. In this work, we report isolation of ω variants whose expression in vivo leads to a dominant lethal phenotype. Studies show that in contrast to ω, which is largely unstructured, ω mutants display substantial acquisition of secondary structure.

https://openalex.org/W1973535547,"Background There are no data on the metabolic consequences of post-term birth (≥42 weeks gestation). We hypothesized that post-term birth would adversely affect insulin sensitivity, as well as other metabolic parameters and body composition in childhood. Methods 77 healthy pre-pubertal children, born appropriate-for-gestational-age were studied in Auckland, New Zealand: 36 born post-term (18 boys) and 41 (27 boys) born at term (38–40 weeks gestation). Primary outcome was insulin sensitivity measured using intravenous glucose tolerance tests and Bergman’s minimal model. Other assessments included fasting hormone concentrations and lipid profiles, body composition from whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and inflammatory markers. Results Insulin sensitivity was 34% lower in post-term than in term children (7.7 vs. 11.6 x10-4·min-1·(mU/l); p<0.0001). There was a compensatory increase in acute insulin response among post-term children (418 vs 304 mU/l; p=0.037), who also displayed lower glucose effectiveness than those born at term (2.25 vs 3.11 x10-2·min-1; p=0.047). Post-term children not only had more body fat (p=0.014) and less fat-free mass (p=0.014), but also had increased central adiposity with more truncal fat (p=0.017) and greater android to gynoid fat ratio (p=0.007) compared to term controls. Further, post-term children displayed other markers of the metabolic syndrome: lower normal nocturnal systolic blood pressure dipping (p=0.027), lower adiponectin concentrations (p=0.005), as well as higher leptin (p=0.008) and uric acid (p=0.033) concentrations. Post-term boys (but not girls) also displayed a less favourable lipid profile, with higher total cholesterol (p=0.018) and LDL-C (p=0.006) concentrations, and total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio (p=0.048). Conclusions Post-term children have reduced insulin sensitivity and display a number of early markers of the metabolic syndrome. These findings could have important implications for the management of prolonged pregnancies. Future studies need to examine potential impacts later in life, as well as possible underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2018172002,"Potassium, a widely accepted macronutrient, is vital for many physiological processes such as regulation of cell volume, maintenance of intracellular pH, synthesis of proteins and activation of enzymes in filamentous fungi. Another cation, calcium, plays an essential role in many signaling processes from lower to higher eukaryotes. Imbalance in the intracellular ionic levels of potassium or calcium causes adverse effects on cell growth, morphology and development, and eventually death. Previous studies on the adaptation of Aspergillus nidulans to salt and osmotic stress conditions have revealed the role of SltA, a C₂H₂ zinc finger transcription factor in cation homeostasis. SltA is highly conserved in the Ascomycota phylum with no identifiable homolog in S. cerevisiae and other yeast-like fungi, and prevents toxicity by the cations Na⁺, K⁺, Li⁺, Cs⁺ and Mg²⁺, but not by Ca²⁺. However its role in morphology and biosynthesis of natural products such as mycotoxins remained unknown. This study shows the first characterization of the role of calcium and SltA fungal homologs in morphogenesis using the model system A. nidulans. Addition of potassium to sltA deletion mutants resulted in decreased levels of sterigmatocystin production. A similar phenotype was observed for both types of mutants in veA1 and veA⁺ genetic background. Expression of the sterigmatocystin genes aflR and stcU was strongly reduced in sltA deletion mutant when K⁺ was added. Additionally, increased concentrations of K⁺ drastically reduced sexual and asexual development, as well as radial growth in deletion sltA colonies. This reduction was accompanied by lower expression of the morphology related genes nsdD, steA and brlA. Interestingly, addition of calcium was able to stimulate asexual and sexual development and remediate the deletion sltA phenotype, including defects in morphology and toxin production."
https://openalex.org/W2104012010,"Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is caused by genetic defects decreasing Fas function and is characterized by lymphadenopathy/splenomegaly and expansion of CD4/CD8 double-negative T cells. This latter expansion is absent in the ALPS variant named Dianzani Autoimmune/lymphoproliferative Disease (DALD). In addition to the causative mutations, the genetic background influences ALPS and DALD development. We previously suggested a disease-modifying role for the perforin gene involved in familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL). The UNC13D gene codes for Munc13-4, which is involved in perforin secretion and FHL development, and thus, another candidate for a disease-modifying role in ALPS and DALD. In this work, we sequenced UNC13D in 21 ALPS and 20 DALD patients and compared these results with sequences obtained from 61 healthy subjects and 38 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We detected four rare missense variations in three heterozygous ALPS patients carrying p.Cys112Ser, p.Val781Ile, and a haplotype comprising both p.Ile848Leu and p.Ala995Pro. Transfection of the mutant cDNAs into HMC-1 cells showed that they decreased granule exocytosis, compared to the wild-type construct. An additional rare missense variation, p.Pro271Ser, was detected in a healthy subject, but this variation did not decrease Munc13-4 function. These data suggest that rare loss-of-function variations of UND13D are risk factors for ALPS development."
https://openalex.org/W2118640006,"Adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5) was described as major cardiac AC isoform. The knockout of AC5 (AC5KO) exerted cardioprotective effects in heart failure. Our study explored the impact of AC5KO on mouse heart AC activities and evaluated putative AC5-selective inhibitors. In cardiac membranes from AC5KO mice, basal AC activity was decreased, while AC stimulation was intact. The putative AC5-selective P-site inhibitors SQ22,536 [9-(tetra-hydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine], vidarabine (9-β-D-arabinosyladenine) and NKY80 [2-amino-7-(2-furanyl)-7,8-dihydro-5(6H)-quinazolinone] inhibited recombinant AC5 more potently than AC2 and AC1, but selectivity was only modest (∼4-40-fold). These compounds inhibited cardiac AC from WT and AC5KO mice with similar potencies. In conclusion, AC regulation in AC5KO hearts was unimpaired, questioning the supposed dominant role of AC5 in the heart. Moreover, the AC inhibitors SQ22,536, NKY80 and vidarabine lack adequate selectivity for AC5 and, therefore, do not present suitable tools to study AC5-specific functions."
https://openalex.org/W1970931631,"Perceptual decision making is prone to errors, especially near threshold. Physiological, behavioural and modeling studies suggest this is due to the intrinsic or 'internal' noise in neural systems, which derives from a mixture of bottom-up and top-down sources. We show here that internal noise can form the basis of perceptual decision making when the external signal lacks the required information for the decision. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in listeners attempting to discriminate between identical tones. Since the acoustic signal was constant, bottom-up and top-down influences were under experimental control. We found that early cortical responses to the identical stimuli varied in global field power and topography according to the perceptual decision made, and activity preceding stimulus presentation could predict both later activity and behavioural decision. Our results suggest that activity variations induced by internal noise of both sensory and cognitive origin are sufficient to drive discrimination judgments."
https://openalex.org/W2091033658,"Symmetry has a central role in visual art, it is often linked to beauty, and observers can detect it efficiently in the lab. We studied what kind of fast and automatic responses are generated by visual presentation of symmetrical patterns. Specifically, we tested whether a brief presentation of novel symmetrical patterns engenders positive affect using a priming paradigm. The abstract patterns were used as primes in a pattern-word interference task. To ensure that familiarity was not a factor, no pattern and no word was ever repeated within each experiment. The task was to classify words that were selected to have either positive or negative valence. We tested irregular patterns, patterns containing vertical and horizontal reflectional symmetry, and patterns containing a 90 deg rotation. In a series of 7 experiments we found that the effect of affective congruence was present for both types of regularity but only when observers had to classify the regularity of the pattern after responding to the word. The findings show that processing abstract symmetrical shapes or random pattern can engender positive or negative affect as long as the regularity of the pattern is a feature that observers have to attend to and classify."
https://openalex.org/W1972761814,"Juvenile noble crayfish, Astacus astacus (Crustacea, Astacidea) in the second year of age were kept in the laboratory for a twelve-month period under continuing “summer conditions” (LD 16:8, 19°C). Molting processes in this population could be synchronized by artificial moonlight cycles. Peaks of exuviations occurred at “new moons”. Males showed a slightly higher degree of synchronization than females. A phase-shift of the artificial lunar cycle in relation to the natural cycle resulted in a corresponding shift of the molting cycle. This clearly demonstrates that changes in the nocturnal light regime provide the primary external information for the lunar-monthly molting rhythm. There is a first indication that lunar photic stimuli do not act directly but as a zeitgeber which entrains an endogenous molting rhythm to the lunar cycle. Moreover, the results of the long-term experiments suggest that the hibernal resting period of A. astacus in the field (no molts between October and April) may also involve some endogenous programming. Continuing artificial summer conditions can delay but not completely suppress this resting period. The adaptive significance of the phenomena and how the findings may be applied to improve the management of crowded crayfish stocks are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2055624154,"The vaccinia virus TianTan (VTT) has been modified as an HIV vaccine vector in China and has shown excellent performance in immunogenicity and safety. However, its adverse effects in immunosuppressed individuals warrant the search for a safer vector in the following clinic trails. In this study, we deleted the C7L and K1L genes of VTT and constructed six recombinant vaccinia strains VTT△C7L, VTT△K1L, VTT△C7LK1L, VTKgpe△C7L, VTKgpe△K1L and VTT△C7LK1L-gag. The pathogenicity and immunogenicity of these recombinants were evaluated in mouse and rabbit models. Comparing to parental VTT, VTT△C7L and VTT△K1L showed significantly decreased replication capability in CEF, Vero, BHK-21 and HeLa cell lines. In particular, replication of VTT△C7LK1L decreased more than 10-fold in all four cell lines. The virulence of all these mutants were decreased in BALB/c mouse and rabbit models; VTT△C7LK1L once again showed the greatest attenuation, having resulted in no evident damage in mice and erythema of only 0.4 cm diameter in rabbits, compared to 1.48 cm for VTT. VTKgpe△C7L, VTKgpe△K1L and VTT△C7LK1L-gag elicited as strong cellular and humoral responses against HIV genes as did VTKgpe, while humoral immune response against the vaccinia itself was reduced by 4-8-fold. These data show that deletion of C7L and K1L genes leads to significantly decreased virulence without compromising animal host immunogenicity, and may thus be key to creating a more safe and effective HIV vaccine vector."
https://openalex.org/W2103949858,"To complete meiosis II in animal cells, the male DNA material needs to meet the female DNA material contained in the female pronucleus at the egg center, but it is not known how the male pronucleus, deposited by the sperm at the periphery of the cell, finds the cell center in large eggs. Pronucleus centering is an active process that appears to involve microtubules and molecular motors. For small and medium-sized cells, the force required to move the centrosome can arise from either microtubule pushing on the cortex, or cortically-attached dynein pulling on microtubules. However, in large cells, such as the fertilized Xenopus laevis embryo, where microtubules are too long to support pushing forces or they do not reach all boundaries before centrosome centering begins, a different force generating mechanism must exist. Here, we present a centrosome positioning model in which the cytosolic drag experienced by cargoes hauled by cytoplasmic dynein on the sperm aster microtubules can move the centrosome towards the cell's center. We find that small, fast cargoes (diameter ∼100 nm, cargo velocity ∼2 µm/s) are sufficient to move the centrosome in the geometry of the Xenopus laevis embryo within the experimentally observed length and time scales."
https://openalex.org/W1998263816,"The myeloid translocation gene 16 product MTG16 is found in multiple transcription factor–containing complexes as a regulator of gene expression implicated in development and tumorigenesis. A stable Tet-On system for doxycycline–dependent expression of MTG16 was established in B-lymphoblastoid Raji cells to unravel its molecular functions in transformed cells. A noticeable finding was that expression of certain genes involved in tumor cell metabolism including 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 and 4 (PFKFB3 and PFKFB4), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 1 (PDK1) was rapidly diminished when MTG16 was expressed. Furthermore, hypoxia–stimulated production of PFKFB3, PFKFB4 and PDK1 was inhibited by MTG16 expression. The genes in question encode key regulators of glycolysis and its coupling to mitochondrial metabolism and are commonly found to be overexpressed in transformed cells. The MTG16 Nervy Homology Region 2 (NHR2) oligomerization domain and the NHR3 protein–protein interaction domain were required intact for inhibition of PFKFB3, PFKFB4 and PDK1 expression to occur. Expression of MTG16 reduced glycolytic metabolism while mitochondrial respiration and formation of reactive oxygen species increased. The metabolic changes were paralleled by increased phosphorylation of mitogen–activated protein kinases, reduced levels of amino acids and inhibition of proliferation with a decreased fraction of cells in S-phase. Overall, our findings show that MTG16 can serve as a brake on glycolysis, a stimulator of mitochondrial respiration and an inhibitor of cell proliferation. Hence, elevation of MTG16 might have anti–tumor effect."
https://openalex.org/W2046709463,"Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a powerful modulator of renal hemodynamic and fluid homeostasis. Up-regulation in components of intra-renal RAS occurs with ageing. Recently we reported that 2 year old uninephrectomised (uni-x) female sheep have low renin hypertension and reduced renal function. By 5 years of age, these uni-x sheep had augmented decrease in renal blood flow (RBF) compared to sham. We hypothesised that this decrease in RBF in 5 year old uni-x sheep was due to an up-regulation in components of the intra-renal RAS. In this study, renal responses to angiotensin II (AngII) infusion and AngII type 1 receptor (AT1R) blockade were examined in the same 5 year old sheep. We also administered AngII in the presence of losartan to increase AngII bioavailability to the AT2R in order to understand AT2R contribution to renal function in this model. Uni-x animals had significantly lower renal cortical content of renin, AngII (∼40%) and Ang 1–7 (∼60%) and reduced cortical expression of AT1R gene than sham animals. In response to both AngII infusion and AT1R blockade via losartan, renal hemodynamic responses and tubular sodium excretion were significantly attenuated in uni-x animals compared to sham. However, AngII infusion in the presence of losartan caused ∼33% increase in RBF in uni-x sheep compared to ∼14% in sham (P<0.05). This was associated with a significant decrease in renal vascular resistance in the uni-x animals (22% vs 15%, P<0.05) without any changes in systemic blood pressure. The present study shows that majority of the intra-renal RAS components are suppressed in this model of low renin hypertension. However, increasing the availability of AngII to AT2R by AT1R blockade improved renal blood flow in uni-x sheep. This suggests that manipulation of the AT2R maybe a potential therapeutic target for treatment of renal dysfunction associated with a congenital nephron deficit."
https://openalex.org/W2117139439,"Conservation efforts to increase duck production have led the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to restore grasslands with multi-species (3-5) mixtures of introduced cool season vegetation often termed dense nesting cover (DNC). The effectiveness of DNC to increase duck production has been variable, and maintenance of the cover type is expensive. In an effort to decrease the financial and ecological costs (increased carbon emissions from plowing and reseeding) of maintaining DNC and provide a long-term, resilient cover that will support a diversity of grassland fauna, restoration of multi-species (16-32) plantings of native plants has been explored. We investigated the vegetation characteristics, nesting density and nest survival between the 2 aforementioned cover types in the Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota, USA from 2010–2011 to see if restored-native plantings provide similar benefits to nesting hens as DNC. We searched 14 fields (7 DNC, 271 ha; and 7 restored native, 230 ha) locating 3384 nests (1215 in restored-native vegetation and 2169 in DNC) in 2010-2011. Nest survival was similar between cover types in 2010, while DNC had greater survival than native plantings in 2011. Densities of nests adjusted for detection probability were not different between cover types in either year. We found no structural difference in vegetation between cover types in 2010; however, a difference was detected during the late sampling period in 2011 with DNC having deeper litter and taller vegetation. Our results indicate restored-native plantings are able to support similar nesting density as DNC; however, nest survival is more stable between years in DNC. It appears the annual variation in security between cover types goes undetected by hens as hens selected cover types at similar levels both years."
https://openalex.org/W1979603499,"The COP9 signalosome (CSN), an evolutionally highly conserved protein complex composed of 8 unique subunits (CSN1 through CSN8) in higher eukaryotes, is purported to modulate protein degradation mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) but this has not been demonstrated in a critical mitotic parenchymal organ of vertebrates. Hepatocyte-specific knockout of the Cops8 gene (HS-Csn8KO) was shown to cause massive hepatocyte apoptosis and liver malfunction but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that Csn8/CSN exerts profound impacts on hepatic UPS function and is critical to the stability of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim. Significant decreases in CIS (cytokine-inducible Src homology 2 domain-containing protein), a Bim receptor of a cullin2-based ubiquitin ligase, were found to co-exist with a marked increase of Bim proteins. Csn8 deficiency also significantly decreased 19S proteasome subunit Rpt5 and markedly increased high molecular weight neddylated and ubiquitinated proteins. The use of a surrogate UPS substrate further reveals severe impairment of UPS-mediated proteolysis in HS-Csn8KO livers. Inclusion body-like materials were accumulated in Csn8 deficient hepatocytes. In addition to Bim, massive hepatocyte apoptosis in HS-Csn8KO livers is also associated with elevated expression of other members of the Bcl2 family, including pro-apoptotic Bax as well as anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and Bcl-XL. Increased interaction between Bcl2 and Bim, but not between Bcl2 and Bax, was detected. Hence, it is concluded that hepatic CSN8 deficiency impairs the UPS in the liver and the resultant Bim upregulation likely plays an important role in triggering hepatocyte apoptosis via sequestering Bcl2 away from Bax."
https://openalex.org/W2091393409,"Cytokine receptors are randomly distributed on the cell surface membrane and are activated upon binding of their extracellular ligands to mediate downstream cellular activities. We hypothesized that pharmaceutical clustering of ligand-bound, activated receptors may lead to heretofore unrealized gain-of-function with therapeutically desirable properties. We here describe an engineered bifunctional cytokine borne of the fusion of Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GMCSF) and Interleukin-9 (IL9) (hereafter GIFT9 fusokine) and demonstrate that it chaperones co-clustering of the functionally unrelated GMCSF receptor (GMCSFR) and IL9 receptor (IL9R) on cell surface of target cells. We demonstrate that GIFT9 treatment of MC/9 cells leads to transhyperphosphorylation of IL9R-associated STAT1 by GMCSFR-associated JAK2. We also show that IL9R-associated JAK1 and JAK3 augment phosphorylation of GMCSFR-linked STAT5. The functional relevance of these synergistic JAK/STAT transphosphorylation events translates to an increased mitogenic response by GMCSFR/IL9R-expressing primary marrow mast cells. The notion of inducing heterologous receptor clustering by engineered fusokines such as GIFT9 opens the door to a novel type of biopharmaceutical platform where designer fusokines modulate cell physiology through clustering of targeted receptor complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2070441258,"We have reported the upregulation of MARCO, a member of the class A scavenger receptor family, on the surface of murine and human dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with tumor lysates. Exposure of murine tumor lysate-pulsed DCs to an anti-MARCO antibody led to loss of dendritic-like processes and enhanced migratory capacity. In this study, we have further examined the biological and therapeutic implications of MARCO expression by DCs. DCs generated from the bone marrow (bm) of MARCO knockout (MARCO⁻/⁻) mice were phenotypically similar to DCs generated from the bm of wild-type mice and produced normal levels of IL-12 and TNF-α when exposed to LPS. MARCO⁻/⁻ DCs demonstrated enhanced migratory capacity in response to CCL-21 in vitro. After subcutaneous injection into mice, MARCO⁻/⁻ TP-DCs migrated more efficiently to the draining lymph node leading to enhanced generation of tumor-specific IFN-γ producing T cells and improved tumor regression and survival in B16 melanoma-bearing mice. These results support targeting MARCO on the surface of DCs to improve trafficking and induction of anti-tumor immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2082247896,"Transcriptional control by TCF/LEF proteins is crucial in key developmental processes such as embryo polarity, tissue architecture and cell fate determination. TCFs associate with β-catenin to activate transcription in the presence of Wnt signaling, but in its absence act as repressors together with Groucho-family proteins (GRGs). TCF4 is critical in vertebrate intestinal epithelium, where TCF4-β-catenin complexes are necessary for the maintenance of a proliferative compartment, and their abnormal formation initiates tumorigenesis. However, the extent of TCF4-GRG complexes’ roles in development and the mechanisms by which they repress transcription are not completely understood. Here we characterize the interaction between TCF4 and GRG5/AES, a Groucho family member whose functional relationship with TCFs has been controversial. We map the core GRG interaction region in TCF4 to a 111-amino acid fragment and show that, in contrast to other GRGs, GRG5/AES-binding specifically depends on a 4-amino acid motif (LVPQ) present only in TCF3 and some TCF4 isoforms. We further demonstrate that GRG5/AES represses Wnt-mediated transcription both in human cells and zebrafish embryos. Importantly, we provide the first evidence of an inherent repressive function of GRG5/AES in dorsal-ventral patterning during early zebrafish embryogenesis. These results improve our understanding of TCF-GRG interactions, have significant implications for models of transcriptional repression by TCF-GRG complexes, and lay the groundwork for in depth direct assessment of the potential role of Groucho-family proteins in both normal and abnormal development."
https://openalex.org/W1991463555,"The aim of this study is to investigate whether reliable and accurate 3D geometrical models of the murine aortic arch can be constructed from sparse-view data in vivo micro-CT acquisitions. This would considerably reduce acquisition time and X-ray dose. In vivo contrast-enhanced micro-CT datasets were reconstructed using a conventional filtered back projection algorithm (FDK), the image space reconstruction algorithm (ISRA) and total variation regularized ISRA (ISRA-TV). The reconstructed images were then semi-automatically segmented. Segmentations of high- and low-dose protocols were compared and evaluated based on voxel classification, 3D model diameters and centerline differences. FDK reconstruction does not lead to accurate segmentation in the case of low-view acquisitions. ISRA manages accurate segmentation with 1024 or more projection views. ISRA-TV needs a minimum of 256 views. These results indicate that accurate vascular models can be obtained from micro-CT scans with 8 times less X-ray dose and acquisition time, as long as regularized iterative reconstruction is used."
https://openalex.org/W2139952451,"Rho family GTPases act as molecular switches to regulate a range of physiological functions, including the regulation of the actin-based cytoskeleton, membrane trafficking, cell morphology, nuclear gene expression, and cell growth. Rho function is regulated by its ability to bind GTP and by its localization. We previously demonstrated functional and physical interactions between Rho3 and the clathrin-associated adaptor protein-1 (AP-1) complex, which revealed a role of Rho3 in regulating Golgi/endosomal trafficking in fission yeast. Sip1, a conserved AP-1 accessory protein, recruits the AP-1 complex to the Golgi/endosomes through physical interaction. In this study, we showed that Sip1 is required for Rho3 localization. First, overexpression of rho3+ suppressed defective membrane trafficking associated with sip1-i4 mutant cells, including defects in vacuolar fusion, Golgi/endosomal trafficking and secretion. Notably, Sip1 interacted with Rho3, and GFP-Rho3, similar to Apm1-GFP, did not properly localize to the Golgi/endosomes in sip1-i4 mutant cells at 27°C. Interestingly, the C-terminal region of Sip1 is required for its localization to the Golgi/endosomes, because Sip1-i4-GFP protein failed to properly localize to Golgi/endosomes, whereas the fluorescence of Sip1ΔN mutant protein co-localized with that of FM4-64. Consistently, in the sip1-i4 mutant cells, which lack the C-terminal region of Sip1, binding between Apm1 and Rho3 was greatly impaired, presumably due to mislocalization of these proteins in the sip1-i4 mutant cells. Furthermore, the interaction between Apm1 and Rho3 as well as Rho3 localization to the Golgi/endosomes were significantly rescued in sip1-i4 mutant cells by the expression of Sip1ΔN. Taken together, these results suggest that Sip1 recruits Rho3 to the Golgi/endosomes through physical interaction and enhances the formation of the Golgi/endosome AP-1/Rho3 complex, thereby promoting crosstalk between AP-1 and Rho3 in the regulation of Golgi/endosomal trafficking in fission yeast."
