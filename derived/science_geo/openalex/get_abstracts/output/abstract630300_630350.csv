https://openalex.org/W2923370183,"Quantum computation, a paradigm of computing that is completely different from classical methods, benefits from theoretically proved speed-ups for certain problems and can be used to study the properties of quantum systems1. Yet, because of the inherently fragile nature of the physical computing elements (qubits), achieving quantum advantages over classical computation requires extremely low error rates for qubit operations, as well as substantial physical qubits, to realize fault tolerance via quantum error correction2,3. However, recent theoretical work4,5 has shown that the accuracy of computation (based on expectation values of quantum observables) can be enhanced through an extrapolation of results from a collection of experiments of varying noise. Here we demonstrate this error mitigation protocol on a superconducting quantum processor, enhancing its computational capability, with no additional hardware modifications. We apply the protocol to mitigate errors in canonical single- and two-qubit experiments and then extend its application to the variational optimization6–8 of Hamiltonians for quantum chemistry and magnetism9. We effectively demonstrate that the suppression of incoherent errors helps to achieve an otherwise inaccessible level of accuracy in the variational solutions using our noisy processor. These results demonstrate that error mitigation techniques will enable substantial improvements in the capabilities of near-term quantum computing hardware. The accuracy of computations on noisy, near-term quantum systems can be enhanced by extrapolating results from experiments with various noise levels, without requiring additional hardware modifications."

However, their application is restricted due to limited performances of caloric materials. Here, we have identified colossal barocaloric effects (CBCEs) in a class of disordered solids called plastic crystals. The obtained entropy changes are about 380 J kg-1 K-1 in the representative neopentylglycol around room temperature. Inelastic neutron scattering reveals that the CBCEs in plastic crystals are attributed to the combination of the vast molecular orientational disorder, giant compressibility, and high anharmonic lattice dynamics. Our study establishes the microscopic scenario for CBCEs in plastic crystals and paves a new route to the next-generation solid-state refrigeration technology."

Machine-learning may offer potential to explore outcomes of even greater complexity, such as premature death. This study aimed to develop novel prediction algorithms using machine-learning, in addition to standard survival modelling, to predict premature all-cause mortality.A prospective population cohort of 502,628 participants aged 40-69 years were recruited to the UK Biobank from 2006-2010 and followed-up until 2016. Participants were assessed on a range of demographic, biometric, clinical and lifestyle factors. Mortality data by ICD-10 were obtained from linkage to Office of National Statistics. Models were developed using deep learning, random forest and Cox regression. Calibration was assessed by comparing observed to predicted risks; and discrimination by area under the 'receiver operating curve' (AUC).14,418 deaths (2.9%) occurred over a total follow-up time of 3,508,454 person-years. A simple age and gender Cox model was the least predictive (AUC 0.689, 95% CI 0.681-0.699). A multivariate Cox regression model significantly improved discrimination by 6.2% (AUC 0.751, 95% CI 0.748-0.767). The application of machine-learning algorithms further improved discrimination by 3.2% using random forest (AUC 0.783, 95% CI 0.776-0.791) and 3.9% using deep learning (AUC 0.790, 95% CI 0.783-0.797). These ML algorithms improved discrimination by 9.4% and 10.1% respectively from a simple age and gender Cox regression model. Random forest and deep learning achieved similar levels of discrimination with no significant difference. Machine-learning algorithms were well-calibrated, while Cox regression models consistently over-predicted risk.Machine-learning significantly improved accuracy of prediction of premature all-cause mortality in this middle-aged population, compared to standard methods. This study illustrates the value of machine-learning for risk prediction within a traditional epidemiological study design, and how this approach might be reported to assist scientific verification."
https://openalex.org/W2924561613,"There is considerable concern about the role that social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, play in promoting misperceptions during political campaigns. These technologies are widely used, and inaccurate information flowing across them has a high profile. This research uses three-wave panel surveys conducted with representative samples of Americans during both the 2012 and 2016 U.S. Presidential elections to assess whether use of social media for political information promoted endorsement of falsehoods about major party candidates or important campaign issues. Fixed effects regression helps ensure that observed effects are not due to individual differences. Results indicate that social media use had a small but significant influence on misperceptions about President Obama in the 2012 election, and that this effect was most pronounced among strong partisans. Social media had no effect on belief accuracy about the Republican candidate in that election. The 2016 survey focused on campaign issues. There is no evidence that social media use influenced belief accuracy about these topics in aggregate, but Facebook users were unique. Social media use by this group reduced issue misperceptions relative to those who only used other social media. These results demonstrate that social media can alter citizens' willingness to endorse falsehoods during an election, but that the effects are often small."

https://openalex.org/W2925195818,"Individualized therapy in endometrial cancer, the most common gynaecologic cancer in the developed world, focuses on identifying specific molecular subtypes. Mutations in the exonuclease domain of the DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) gene define one such subtype, which causes an ultra-mutated tumour phenotype. These tumours may have an improved progression-free survival and may be receptive to specific therapies. However, the clinical phenotype of these tumours is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical and genetic features of POLE-mutated tumours from a large cohort of women whose cases are characterized by: (1) the availability of detailed clinical and lifestyle data; (2) mutation analysis; and (3) long-term follow-up.A total of 604 patients with endometrial cancer were included in the study. Data from a detailed questionnaire, including lifestyle and family history information, provided extensive pertinent information on the patients. Sequencing of exons 9-14 of the POLE gene was performed. Follow-up data were gathered and analysed.Hotspot pathogenic POLE mutations were identified in N = 38/599 patients (6.3%). Patients with a POLE-mutated tumour were significantly younger, were more often nulliparous, and had a history of smoking. POLE-mutated tumours were more frequently aneuploid. Prognosis for patients with hotspot POLE-mutated tumours was significantly better in comparison with patients with non-mutated tumours; however careful selection of pathogenic mutations is essential to the definition of this prognostically favourable group.This study demonstrates that POLE-mutated endometrial cancer is significantly associated with previously unknown clinicopathologic characteristics. Outcome in POLE-mutated tumours was excellent in cases with hotspot mutations. Our results suggest that prediction of excellent outcome in cases of POLE-mutated EMCA should be restricted to cases of EMCA with hotspot mutations until further data are available on the rising number of mutations with unknown significance."
https://openalex.org/W2922652697,"This study investigates which of four paradigms best portrays the risk profile manifest by investors in their financial asset investment decisions. The paradigms used to explain this profile were: prospect theory, investor profile analysis (IPA), the Big Five Personality Test, and the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT). The choice of proxy for the risk preferences (profile) of a typical investor was defined by simulating investments in a laboratory setting. The results are analyzed using ordered logistic regression and show that people who have greater risk tolerance according to IPA, who violate prospect theory, and who have a high degree of openness to experience have the greatest probability of taking higher levels of risk in their investment decisions. With regard to the CRT, higher numbers of correct responses in this test has an inverse relationship with risk taking."
https://openalex.org/W2924070987,"Despite years of HIV testing and other interventions, Lesotho continues to experience an incredibly high HIV burden. Prevalence of HIV among children ages 0-14 years is at 2.1% and 25.6% among adults ages 15-59 years. Among adults living with HIV, 77.2% know their status, 90.2% of those with known HIV positive status are currently receiving ART and 88.3% are virally suppressed. In order to identify adults, adolescents and children at high risk of HIV infection, Population Services International (PSI)/Lesotho with support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) introduced the HIV Index testing model in 2015. PLHIV recruited for index testing, were accessed through health facilities and community testing at PSI New Start channels in five districts. Consenting index clients received home visits for HIV testing of their biological children and sexual partners with unknown status. Routine monitoring of data gathered between May 2015 and November 2017 was analyzed to assess feasibility of this approach. For HIV index testing, 49.2% of children below 15 years and 37.3% of adolescents ages 15-19 were first time testers while 18.8% of all adults aged 20 years and above tested were testing for the first time. Higher HIV positivity rates among clients tested through the HIV index testing model across all age groups in comparison to other HIV testing models were statistically significant. Among children ages 2-14 years, the HIV positivity rate was 1.4%, adolescents ages 15-19 years had a positivity rate of 2.4% and adults ages 20 years and above had a positivity rate of 17.6%. Linkage rates of 92%, 73% and 72% for children, adolescents and adults, respectively, achieved with the HIV index testing model were higher than linkage rates observed with other HIV testing models. Results indicate that testing of biological children and sexual partners utilizing the HIV index testing model can be viable to identify and link children, adolescents and adults into care and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2924422663,"Background Men and women are increasingly likely to stay sexually active into later life, but research shows that sexual activity and satisfaction decrease with increasing age. Ill health and medical treatments may affect sexual activity but there is little research on why some older people with a health problem affecting their sexual activity are satisfied with their sex life, and others are not. Methods A mixed method study integrating data and analyses from the third British National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (n = 3343 aged 55–74 years) and from follow-up in-depth interviews with 23 survey participants who reported having a health condition or taking medication affecting their sex life. Results Overall, 26.9% of men and 17.1% of women aged 55–74 reported having a health condition that affected their sex life. Among this group, women were less likely than men to be sexually active in the previous 6 months (54.3% vs 62.0%) but just as likely to be satisfied with their sex life (41.9% vs 42.1%). In follow-up interviews, participants sometimes struggled to tease out the effects of ill health from those of advancing age. Where effects of ill health were identified, they tended to operate through the inclination and capacity to be sexually active, the practical possibilities for doing so and the limits placed on forms of sexual expression. In close relationships partners worked to establish compensatory mechanisms, but in less close relationships ill health provided an excuse to stop sex or deterred attempts to resolve difficulties. Most fundamentally, ill health may influence whether individuals have a partner with whom to have sex. Conclusion The data show complex interactions between health, lifestyle and relationship factors that affect sexual activity/satisfaction. When dealing with sexual problems in older people, practitioners need to take account of individual lifestyle, needs and preferences."
https://openalex.org/W2924751031,"Genetic and epigenetic variability between iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) combined with differences in investigator technique and selection protocols contributes to variability between NPC lines, which subsequently impacts the quality of differentiated neuronal cultures. We therefore sought to develop an efficient method to reduce this variability in order to improve the purity of NPC and neuronal cultures. Here, we describe a magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) method for enriching NPC cultures for CD271-/CD133+ cells at both early (<2-3) and late (>10) passage. MACS results in a similar sorting efficiency to fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), while achieving an increased yield of live cells and reduced cellular stress. Furthermore, neurons derived from MACS NPCs showed greater homogeneity between cell lines compared to those derived from unsorted NPCs. We conclude that MACS is a cheap technique for incorporation into standard NPC differentiation and maintenance protocols in order to improve culture homogeneity and consistency."
https://openalex.org/W2923443694,"Identifying university students’ weaknesses results in better learning and can function as an early warning system to enable students to improve. However, the satisfaction level of existing systems is not promising. New and dynamic hybrid systems are needed to imitate this mechanism. A hybrid system (a modified Recurrent Neural Network with an adapted Grey Wolf Optimizer) is used to forecast students’ outcomes. This proposed system would improve instruction by the faculty and enhance the students’ learning experiences. The results show that a modified recurrent neural network with an adapted Grey Wolf Optimizer has the best accuracy when compared with other models."
https://openalex.org/W2925298067,"Usage of high-throughput sequencing approaches allow for the generation and characterization of reference transcriptome datasets that support gene-based marker discovery, which in turn can be used to build genetic maps among other purposes. We have obtained a transcriptome assembly including 49,453 genes for the lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) cultivar Alpo using RNAseq methodology. This transcriptome was used as reference to obtain 6,306 quality polymorphic markers (SNPs and short indels) analyzing genotype data from a RIL population at F7 generation derived from the interspecific cross between L. culinaris cv. Alpo and L. odemensis accession ILWL235. L. odemensis is a wild species included in the secondary gene pool and can be used as a source for gene introgression in lentil breeding programs. Marker data were used to construct the first genetic interspecific map between these two species. This linkage map has been used to precisely identify regions of the CDC-Redberry lentil draft genome in which the candidate genes for some qualitative traits (seed coat spotting pattern, flower color, and stem pigmentation) could be located. The genome regions corresponding to a significant single quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling ""time to flowering"" located in chromosome 6 and three QTLs regulating seed size and positioned in chromosomes 1 and 5 (two QTLs) were also identified. Significant QTLs for Ascochyta blight resistance in lentil were mapped to chromosome 6 in the genome region or close to it where QTLs for Ascochyta blight resistance have previously been reported."
https://openalex.org/W2923404453,"Miniaturised frogs form a fascinating but poorly understood amphibian ecomorph and have been exceptionally prone to taxonomic underestimation. The subfamily Cophylinae (family Microhylidae), endemic to Madagascar, has a particularly large diversity of miniaturised species which have historically been attributed to the single genus Stumpffia largely based on their small size. Recent phylogenetic work has revealed that several independent lineages of cophyline microhylids evolved towards highly miniaturised body sizes, achieving adult snout–vent lengths under 16 mm. Here, we describe five new species belonging to three clades that independently miniaturised and that are all genetically highly divergent from their relatives: (i) a new genus (Mini gen. nov.) with three new species from southern Madagascar, (ii) one species of Rhombophryne, and (iii) one species of Anodonthyla. Mini mum sp. nov. from Manombo in eastern Madagascar is one of the smallest frogs in the world, reaching an adult body size of 9.7 mm in males and 11.3 mm in females. Mini scule sp. nov. from Sainte Luce in southeastern Madagascar is slightly larger and has maxillary teeth. Mini ature sp. nov. from Andohahela in southeast Madagascar is larger than its congeners but is similar in build. Rhombophryne proportionalis sp. nov. from Tsaratanana in northern Madagascar is unique among Madagascar’s miniaturised frogs in being a proportional dwarf, exhibiting far less advanced signs of paedomorphism than other species of similar size. Anodonthyla eximia sp. nov. from Ranomafana in eastern Madagascar is distinctly smaller than any of its congeners and is secondarily terrestrial, providing evidence that miniaturisation and terrestriality may be evolutionarily linked. The evolution of body size in Madagascar’s microhylids has been more dynamic than previously understood, and future studies will hopefully shed light on the interplay between ecology and evolution of these remarkably diverse frogs."
https://openalex.org/W2895243187,"Information on species distribution is recognized as a crucial input for biodiversity conservation and management. To that end, considerable resources have been dedicated towards increasing the quantity and availability of species occurrence data, boosting their use in species distribution modeling and online platforms for their dissemination. Currently, those platforms face the challenge of bringing biology into modeling by making informed decisions that result in meaningful models, based on limited occurrence and ecological data. Here we describe BioModelos, a modeling approach supported by an online system and a core team of modelers, whereby a network of experts contributes to the development of species distribution models by assessing the quality of occurrence data, identifying potentially limiting environmental variables, establishing species’ accessible areas and validating modeling predictions qualitatively. Models developed through BioModelos become freely and publicly available once validated by experts, furthering their use in conservation applications. Our approach has been implemented in Colombia since 2013 and it currently consist of a network of nearly 500 experts that collaboratively contribute to enhance the knowledge on the distribution of a growing number of species and it has aided the development of several decision support products such as national risk assessments and biodiversity compensation manuals. BioModelos is an example of operationalization of an essential biodiversity variable at a national level through the implementation of a research infrastructure that enhances the value of open access species data."
https://openalex.org/W2923382232,"Background Immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide; IMID) are widely used in the treatment of multiple myeloma patients. To date, few data are available on IMID adherence in multiple myeloma patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate IMID adherence and to compare two indirect methods to measure IMID adherence in multiple myeloma patients: a specific questionnaire and the medication possession ratio (MPR). Another aim was to explore this specific questionnaire for the assessment of IMID adherence in multiple myeloma patients. Methods All consecutive multiple myeloma patients, with at least two consecutive dispensations of thalidomide, lenalidomide or pomalidomide in our hospital were included in this prospective study. IMID adherence was measured using a specific questionnaire and the medication possession ratio. Relationship between the questionnaire scores and variables of interest was evaluated by multiple linear regression with a robust variance estimator. Findings Sixty-three patients were included in our study. The mean questionnaire score was 8.2±1.2 and the mean medication possession ratio value was 0.97±0.06. A total of 76% of patients were considered adherent according to the questionnaire (i.e. score ≥ 8), 94% according to the medication possession ratio (i.e. MPR ≥ 0.90), and 70% according to the questionnaire and the medication possession ratio. No statistically significant linear association was observed between the questionnaire score and any variables of interest including medication possession ratio. All Cronbach’s alpha were relatively low (range 0.0342–0.2443), showing a low correlation of the different questions with the questionnaire score. Conclusions Our study is the first prospective study evaluating IMID adherence in multiple myeloma patients in real life. The high adherence to IMIDs reported here, regardless of the drug, is encouraging considering the efficacy, toxicity and elevated cost of IMIDs. The specific questionnaire should be used with caution to evaluate IMID adherence."
https://openalex.org/W2928162137,"Antibodies that recognize amyloidogenic aggregates with high conformational and sequence specificity are important for detecting and potentially treating a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. However, these types of antibodies are challenging to generate because of the large size, hydrophobicity, and heterogeneity of protein aggregates. To address this challenge, we developed a method for generating antibodies specific for amyloid aggregates. First, we grafted amyloidogenic peptide segments from the target polypeptide [Alzheimer’s amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide] into the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of a stable antibody scaffold. Next, we diversified the grafted and neighboring CDR sites using focused mutagenesis to sample each WT or grafted residue, as well as one to five of the most commonly occurring amino acids at each site in human antibodies. Finally, we displayed these antibody libraries on the surface of yeast cells and selected antibodies that strongly recognize Aβ-amyloid fibrils and only weakly recognize soluble Aβ. We found that this approach enables the generation of monovalent and bivalent antibodies with nanomolar affinity for Aβ fibrils. These antibodies display high conformational and sequence specificity as well as low levels of nonspecific binding and recognize a conformational epitope at the extreme N terminus of human Aβ. We expect that this systematic approach will be useful for generating antibodies with conformational and sequence specificity against a wide range of peptide and protein aggregates associated with neurodegenerative disorders.

First, we have previously developed a strategy that involves grafting key amyloidogenic peptide motifs from amyloid-forming polypeptides (Aβ and IAPP) into the CDRs of single domain (variable heavy, VH) or multidomain (single-chain variable fragment, scFv) antibodies (19Lee C.C.

The resulting grafted amyloid-motif antibodies (gammabodies) bind to their cognate amyloid fibrils with conformational and sequence specificity. These grafted antibodies recognize amyloid fibrils via homotypic interactions between the grafted amyloidogenic peptides and the cognate peptides in fibrils. Nevertheless, the key next steps in improving our anti-amyloid grafted antibodies are to improve their affinity and specificity. We have previously developed a mutagenesis method (Natural Diversity Mutagenesis) (17Tiller K.E. Chowdhury R. Li T. Ludwig S.D. Sen S. Maranas C.D. Tessier P.M. Facile affinity maturation of antibody variable domains using natural diversity mutagenesis.Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 (28928732): 98610.3389/fimmu.2017.00986Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with the goal of designing antibody libraries for affinity maturation. Given that it is not possible to sample all combinations of mutations using 20 amino acids even in a single antibody CDR (e.g. >1019 possible variants for a CDR with 15 residues), our method involved sampling the WT residue at each targeted CDR site as well as one to five mutations that are most common in human antibodies and which are compatible with degenerate codons. This approach enables testing all possible single, double, and higher-order combinations of CDR mutations in a single library by restricting the diversity at each CDR site. We previously used this library design approach for affinity maturation of single-domain (VHH) antibodies and found that it was highly effective for isolating antibody variants with significant improvements in affinity and specificity (17Tiller K.E.

We reasoned that diversifying the grafted Aβ peptide segments in antibody CDRs (e.g. C-terminal Aβ residues 33–42) would lead to the isolation of antibody mutants with either improved homotypic-like interactions (e.g. mutated Aβ C-terminal segments in antibody CDRs interacting with the Aβ C-terminal region in fibrils) or heterotypic interactions (e.g. mutated Aβ C-terminal segments in antibody CDRs interacting with the Aβ N-terminal or central regions in fibrils). These hypotheses are based on the fact that both homotypic (intermolecular) and heterotypic (intramolecular) interactions involving different Aβ peptide segments are observed in Aβ fibrils (23Gremer L.

We also reasoned that the immobilization of Aβ fibrils on magnetic beads (29Ackerman M. Levary D. Tobon G. Hackel B. Orcutt K.D. Wittrup K.D.

Moreover, we posited that negative selections using magnetic beads coated with disaggregated Aβ42 would eliminate antibodies that possess sequence specificity but not conformational specificity. We also expected that these negative selections would be particularly effective at eliminating antibodies with poor specificity in general because antibody CDRs enriched in positively charged and hydrophobic residues, which are expected to associate with the negatively charged and extremely hydrophobic Aβ42 peptide, have been linked to low antibody specificity (16Tiller K.E.

Finally, we reasoned the conformational specificity of monovalent antibodies that we generate against multivalent amyloid aggregates could be significantly increased by reformatting them as bivalent antibodies to enhance avidity effects (36Brännström K. Lindhagen-Persson M. Gharibyan A.L. Iakovleva I. Vestling M. Sellin M.E. Brännström T. Morozova-Roche L. Forsgren L. Olofsson A.

Here, we report integrated library design and selection methods that lead to the isolation of anti-amyloid antibodies with high affinity and specificity. Toward our goal of isolating conformation-specific antibodies against Aβ fibrils with high specificity, we first designed an antibody library using a methodology that involved several key components. First, we grafted Aβ residues 33GLMVGGVVIA42 into heavy chain CDR3 (HCDR3) of a stable single-chain variable fragment (scFv) (16Tiller K.E. Li L. Kumar S. Julian M.C. Garde S. Tessier P.M. Arginine mutations in antibody complementarity-determining regions display context-dependent affinity/specificity trade-offs.J. Biol.

Next, we diversified a total of 15 positions within HCDR3 in a manner that sampled the WT or grafted residue as well as one to five of the most frequently occurring residues in human antibodies (Fig. 2A). The natural frequency of each amino acid at a given position in HCDR3 was obtained from the abYsis database (37Swindells M.B. Porter C.T. Couch M. Hurst J. Abhinandan K.R. Nielsen J.H. Macindoe G. Hetherington J. Martin A.C. abYsis: integrated antibody sequence and structure-management, analysis, and prediction.J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429 (27561707): 356-36410.1016/j.jmb.2016.08.019Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We chose to target a high level of mutagenesis, which results in sampling only two to three grafted Aβ residues per antibody variant on average, to enable the selection of antibodies with potentially large improvements in their binding properties. Our library design methodology aimed to maximize the coverage of amino acid diversity observed in human antibodies at each CDR site in our designed libraries. We define natural diversity coverage as the sum of the average percentage occurrence of each amino acid in human antibodies at each CDR site (as given by the abYsis database) for the subset of residues sampled in our library. For example, the average occurrence at the HCDR3 site 100 (Kabat numbering) is 16% glycine and 12% serine for tens of thousands of human antibody sequences in the abYsis database (37Swindells M.B. Porter C.T. Couch M. Hurst J. Abhinandan K.R. Nielsen J.H. Macindoe G. Hetherington J. Martin A.C. abYsis: integrated antibody sequence and structure-management, analysis, and prediction.J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429 (27561707): 356-36410.1016/j.jmb.2016.08.019Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the degenerate codon used in our library to sample both residues resulted in 28% coverage of natural diversity for human antibodies. At some CDR sites, we achieved >50% coverage of human antibody natural diversity, whereas at other sites the coverage was much lower (e.g. 15%) due to limitations in the combinations of amino acids that could be sampled using a single degenerate codon. For example, at HCDR3 position 100b, sampling the WT residue (methionine) along with the most frequently occurring amino acids (glycine and tyrosine) would lead to inclusion of eight additional amino acids. This is undesirable because it would greatly increase the library size as well as incorporate stop codons and other codons that are rare in human antibodies at this CDR site. Our final design (Fig. 2A) resulted in a library with 6.4 × 107 unique antibody variants, which was small enough to enable sampling of all possible variants using yeast surface display given that we are able to achieve >108 yeast transformants using standard electroporation methods (16Tiller K.E.

We next synthesized the antibody DNA library and cloned it into a yeast surface display plasmid as a C-terminal fusion to a yeast cell-surface protein (Aga2). Sequencing analysis of 27 unique variants from the initial library revealed that the amino acids were generally sampled in HCDR3 as expected based on the library design (Fig. 2B and Fig. S1). Moreover, we expressed the antibody library on the surface of yeast and confirmed expression via a c-Myc tag at the antibody C terminus using flow cytometry (data not shown). Our antibody sorting strategy (as summarized in Fig. 1) involved first performing three negative selections against disaggregated Aβ in round 1. Yeast cells were incubated with magnetic beads coated with disaggregated Aβ, and cells that failed to bind were separated and incubated with a second batch of magnetic beads coated with disaggregated Aβ. After repeating this process for a third time as part of round 1, the remaining (unbound) yeast cells were incubated with magnetic beads coated with Aβ fibrils. Yeast cells that bound to immobilized Aβ fibrils were recovered by regrowing them in fresh media. The number of isolated yeast cells in round 1 was also evaluated by plating them on selective agar plates. As a control to evaluate the performance of our negative selections, we also performed a mock-positive sort against disaggregated Aβ in the same manner as was done for Aβ fibrils. If the negative selections were effective at eliminating antibodies that recognize disaggregated Aβ, we would expect many fewer cells to be retained in these mock-positive selections against disaggregated Aβ relative to the positive selections against aggregated Aβ. In the first three rounds of antibody sorting, we used a large (100-fold) excess of yeast cells (109 cells) relative to magnetic beads (107 beads). Our reasoning was that most of the library would lack affinity and/or specificity for Aβ fibrils, and thus we sought to enrich rare clones in these early rounds of sorting. In these first two rounds, we retained relatively few cells (Fig. 3A), and the antibody library displayed preference for disaggregated Aβ (Fig. 3B). However, in round 3, we observed a modest (2-fold) preference of the library for aggregated Aβ relative to disaggregated Aβ (Fig. 3B). At this point, we reduced the number of yeast cells (107) while maintaining the number of magnetic beads (107) to improve the stringency of the negative selections. This led to significant improvements in the library specificity for fibrils, including a 47-fold preference of the library for recognizing Aβ fibrils in round 5 (Fig. 3B). These encouraging res"

Current selective screening strategies rely on clinical risk factors such as age, family history of diabetes, macrosomia or GDM in a previous pregnancy, and they possess a relatively low specificity. Here we hypothesize that novel first trimester protein predictors of GDM can contribute to the current selective screening strategies for early and accurate prediction of GDM, thus allowing for timely interventions.A proteomics discovery approach was applied to first trimester sera from obese (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) women (n = 60) in a nested case-control study design, utilizing tandem mass tag labelling and tandem mass spectrometry. A subset of the identified protein markers was further validated in a second set of serum samples (n = 210) and evaluated for their contribution as predictors of GDM in relation to the maternal risk factors, by use of logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis.Serum proteomic profiling identified 25 proteins with significantly different levels between cases and controls. Three proteins; afamin, serum amyloid P-component and vitronectin could be further confirmed as predictors of GDM in a validation set. Vitronectin was shown to contribute significantly to the predictive power of the maternal risk factors, indicating it as a novel independent predictor of GDM.Current selective screening strategies can potentially be improved by addition of protein predictors."

Clinical complications include impaired glucose metabolism, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Evidence has shown that natural phenolics play a protective effect on both the development and management of type 2 diabetes. This study evaluated effects of the extract from peanut skins containing polyphenols on induced- hyperglycemia using in vivo and in vitro methods. A human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) was used to investigate the effect of the peanut skin extract on cell viability after exposure to high glucose concentrations. In vivo, the effect of peanut skin extract on an oral glucose tolerance was investigated in human subjects. Fifteen participants aged 21–32 underwent an oral glucose tolerance test with five treatments: 1) 50-gram glucose solution (reference); 2). 50-gram glucose solution, followed by 12 mg of vegi-capsulated maltodextrin; 3) 50-gram glucose solution, followed by 120 mg of vegi-capsulated maltodextrin-encapsulated peanut skin extract; 4). 50-gram glucose solution, followed by 28 grams of unfortified coated peanuts; 5) 50-gram glucose solution, followed by 28 grams of chili lime coated peanuts fortified with encapsulated peanut skin extract. Glucose levels were measured using a continuous monitor. Peanut skin extract was found to attenuate the decrease in cell viability in high glucose treated HepG2 cells, showing a protective effect against hyperglycemia induced cell death. No difference in the glycemic response area under the curve between any treatments using the tolerance test, but the treatment of the peanut skin extract with the glucose reference resulted in a significantly lower peak blood glucose response at 45 minutes, indicating that it was effective at reducing the glycemic response. The present study shows that the phenolic extract of peanut skins has an antidiabetic effect, further confirming their value as a functional food ingredient."
https://openalex.org/W2923504462,"IgA nephropathy(IgAN) is a common glomerular disease with a higher risk of progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in certain ethnic populations. Since galactose deficient IgA1(Gd-IgA1) is a critical molecule in its pathogenesis, it has generated interest as a biomarker for this disease.We measured serum Gd-IgA1 levels using a non- lectin based enzyme linked immunoassay(ELISA) in 136 immunosuppression naïve patients with primary IgAN and 110 controls(60-non IgA glomerular diseases, 50-healthy volunteers).Median serum Gd-IgA1 levels were significantly higher in IgAN patients [13135.6(2723.3,59603.8)ng/ml] compared to those with non IgA glomerular disease [4954.8(892.9,18256.2) ng/ml] and healthy controls [6299.5(1993.2,19256) ng/ml] and this was observed even after log transformation and adjustment for age and gender(p<0.0001). Considering a cut-off value of serum Gd-IGA1≥7982.1ng/ml, the sensitivity for diagnosing IgAN compared to healthy controls was 74.3% and specificity was 72.0% with a positive predictive value of 87.8% and negative predictive value of 50.7%. The serum Gd-IgA1 level did not co-relate with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, urine protein creatinine ratio and the M, E, S, T and C scores on renal biopsy.

A growing body of evidence suggests that lawmakers are more responsive to the rich when they craft policy. However, some scholars theorize that officials also exhibit a corresponding bias in favor of the poor when they handle casework, essentially giving policy to the rich and services to the poor. In this paper, we test this casework prediction using four experiments in which confederates sent simple requests to state or local officials. In each, our confederates’ reported social classes were randomly assigned and signaled with a brief introductory statement mentioning the sender’s occupation or economic situation. Across our samples, we find precisely-estimated null effects of social class biases: the officials we studied were equally likely to respond regardless of the constituent’s class. These findings raise doubts about whether casework is really a class-biased process."

https://openalex.org/W2924985322,"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is often aberrantly activated, particularly when genetically altered, in human cancers. mTOR inhibitors targeting the activated mTOR signaling are highly promising anti-cancer drugs. Knowing the activating genetic change in mTOR can help guide the use of mTOR inhibitors for cancer treatment. This study was conducted to identify and characterize novel oncogenic mTOR mutations that can potentially be therapeutic targets in human cancer. We sequenced 30 exons of the mTOR gene in 12 thyroid cancer cell lines, 3 melanoma cell lines, 20 anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) tumors, and 23 melanoma tumors and functionally characterized the identified novel mTOR mutations in vitro and in vivo. We identified a novel point mutation A1256G in ATC cell line and G7076A in melanoma tumor in exon 9 and exon 51 of the mTOR gene, respectively. Over-expression of the corresponding mTOR mutants H419R and G2359E created through induced mutagenesis showed markedly elevated protein kinase activities associated with the activation of mTOR/p70S6K signaling in HEK293T cells. Stable expression of the two mTOR mutants in NIH3T3 cells strongly activated the mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway and induced morphologic transformation, cell focus formation, anchorage-independent cell growth, and invasion. Inoculation of these mutant-expressing cells in athymic nude mice induced rapid tumor development, showing their driving oncogenicity. We also demonstrated that transfection with the novel mutants conferred cells high sensitivities to the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus. We speculate that human cancers harboring these mTOR mutations, such as ATC and melanoma, may be effectively treated with inhibitors targeting mTOR."
https://openalex.org/W2922893627,"Angiogenesis is critical to cancer development and metastasis. However, anti-angiogenic agents have only had modest therapeutic success, partly due to an incomplete understanding of tumor endothelial cell (EC) biology. We previously reported that the microRNA (miR)-200 family inhibits metastasis through regulation of tumor angiogenesis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly characterized. Here, using integrated bioinformatics approaches, we identified the RNA-binding protein (RBP) quaking (QKI) as a leading miR-200b endothelial target with previously unappreciated roles in the tumor microenvironment in lung cancer. In lung cancer samples, both miR-200b suppression and QKI overexpression corresponded with tumor ECs relative to normal ECs, and QKI silencing phenocopied miR-200b-mediated inhibition of sprouting. Additionally, both cancer cell and endothelial QKI expression in patient samples significantly corresponded with poor survival and correlated with angiogenic indices. QKI supported EC function by stabilizing cyclin D1 (CCND1) mRNA to promote EC G1/S cell cycle transition and proliferation. Both nanoparticle-mediated RNA interference of endothelial QKI expression and palbociclib blockade of CCND1 function potently inhibited metastasis in concert with significant effects on tumor vasculature. Altogether, this work demonstrates the clinical relevance and therapeutic potential of a novel, actionable miR/RBP axis in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2923041485,"Background Damage to endothelial glycocalyx is thought to be an early marker of atherosclerosis and measuring reduced glycocalyx size clinically via the Perfused Boundary Region (PBR) may allow early detection of cardiovascular disease. However, the true value of the glycocalyx in estimating cardiovascular risk or detecting cardiovascular disease is uncertain. We therefore investigated whether small glycocalyx size is associated with cardiovascular risk or disease in a large multi-ethnic cohort. Methods In a multi-ethnic community-based sample (N = 6169, 42.4% male, mean age 43.6 ±13) we applied multiple imputation for missing data and used logistic regression and odds ratios to cross-sectionally investigate the relationship of small glycocalyx size as estimated by highest quartile of PBR with, on the one hand, classical risk factors for atherosclerosis including age, sex, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, BMI, diabetes, smoking status, and antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication; on the other hand, prevalent cardiovascular disease. Analyses were additionally adjusted for ethnicity. Results With PBR divided in quartiles, the highest PBR quartile (smallest glycocalyx size) as dependent variable was independently associated with female sex (OR for male versus female: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.70) and diabetes (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.03–1.59) in a model adjusted for all classical risk factors of atherosclerosis and for ethnicity. With regard to cardiovascular disease, no association was found between the smallest glycocalyx size as independent variable and overall cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease and revascularization procedures, or stroke. Conclusions Small glycocalyx size as estimated by highest PBR is associated with female sex and diabetes, which do not completely reflect a high cardiovascular risk profile. At the same time, glycocalyx size is not associated with prevalent cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2923695679,"Rab proteins play an essential role in regulating intracellular membrane trafficking processes. Rab activity is dependent upon geranylgeranylation, a post-translational modification that involves the addition of 20-carbon isoprenoid chains via the enzyme geranylgeranyl transferase (GGTase) II. We have focused on the development of inhibitors against geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGDPS), which generates the isoprenoid donor (GGPP), as anti-Rab agents. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by abnormal mucin production and these mucins play important roles in tumor development, metastasis and chemo-resistance. We hypothesized that GGDPS inhibitor (GGDPSi) treatment would induce PDAC cell death by disrupting mucin trafficking, thereby inducing the unfolded protein response pathway (UPR) and apoptosis. To this end, we evaluated the effects of RAM2061, a potent GGDPSi, against PDAC. Our studies revealed that GGDPSi treatment activates the UPR and triggers apoptosis in a variety of human and mouse PDAC cell lines. Furthermore, GGDPSi treatment was found to disrupt the intracellular trafficking of key mucins such as MUC1. These effects could be recapitulated by incubation with a specific GGTase II inhibitor, but not a GGTase I inhibitor, consistent with the effect being dependent on disruption of Rab-mediated activities. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of GGDPS induces upregulation of UPR markers and disrupts MUC1 trafficking in PDAC cells. Experiments in two mouse models of PDAC demonstrated that GGDPSi treatment significantly slows tumor growth. Collectively, these data support further development of GGDPSi therapy as a novel strategy for the treatment of PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W2923729367,"The symbiosis between rhizobia and legumes is characterized by a complex molecular dialogue in which the bacterial NodD protein plays a major role due to its capacity to activate the expression of the nodulation genes in the presence of appropiate flavonoids. These genes are involved in the synthesis of molecules, the nodulation factors (NF), responsible for launching the nodulation process. Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899, a rhizobial strain that nodulates Phaseolus vulgaris, is characterized by its tolerance to multiple environmental stresses such as high temperatures, acidity or elevated osmolarity. This strain produces nodulation factors under saline stress and the same set of CIAT 899 nodulation genes activated by inducing flavonoids are also up-regulated in a process controlled by the NodD2 protein. In this paper, we have studied the effect of osmotic stress (high mannitol concentrations) on the R. tropici CIAT 899 transcriptomic response. In the same manner as with saline stress, the osmotic stress mediated NF production and export was controlled directly by NodD2. In contrast to previous reports, the nodA2FE operon and the nodA3 and nodD1 genes were up-regulated with mannitol, which correlated with an increase in the production of biologically active NF. Interestingly, in these conditions, this regulatory protein controlled not only the expression of nodulation genes but also the expression of other genes involved in protein folding and synthesis, motility, synthesis of polysaccharides and, surprinsingly, nitrogen fixation. Moreover, the non-metabolizable sugar dulcitol was also able to induce the NF production and the activation of nod genes in CIAT 899."

In the present study, 3D-scaffold was fabricated using nanocrystalline forsterite powder in polymer sponge method. The FU scaffold was used in investigating the physicochemical, biomechanics, cell attachment, in vitro biocompatibility and osteogenic differentiation properties. For physicochemical characterisation, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoemission spectrometer (XPS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) were used. FTIR, EDX, XRD peaks and Raman spectroscopy demonstrated correlating to FU. The XPS confirmed the surface chemistry associating to FU. The BET revealed FU scaffold surface area of 12.67 m2/g and total pore size of 0.03 cm3/g. Compressive strength of the FU scaffold was found to be 27.18 ± 13.4 MPa. The human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs) characterisation prior to perform seeding on FU scaffold verified the stromal cell phenotypic and lineage commitments. SEM, confocal images and presto blue viability assay suggested good cell attachment and proliferation of hBMSCs on FU scaffold and comparable to a commercial bone substitutes (cBS). Osteogenic proteins and gene expression from day 7 onward indicated FU scaffold had a significant osteogenic potential (p<0.05), when compared with day 1 as well as between FU and cBS. These findings suggest that FU scaffold has a greater potential for use in orthopaedic and/or orthodontic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2923666150,"Long term dietary consumption of genistein by Chinese men is associated with decreased PCa metastasis and mortality. Short term treatment of US men with prostate cancer (PCa) with genistein decreases MMP-2 in prostate tissue. MEK4 regulates MMP-2 expression, drives PCa metastasis, and genistein inhibits MEK4, decreases MMP-2 expression and dietary dosing inhibits human PCa metastasis in mice. This study examines short- versus long-term treatment effects of genistein in humans and in vitro.US men with localized PCa were treated on a phase II trial with genistein (N = 14) versus not (N = 14) for one month prior to radical prostatectomy. Prostate epithelial cells were removed from fresh frozen tissue by laser capture microdissection, and the expression of 12,000 genes profiled. Genistein significantly altered the expression of four genes, three had established links to cancer cell motility and metastasis. Of these three, one was a non-coding transcript, and the other two were BASP1 and HCF2. Genistein increased BASP1 expression in humans, and its engineered over expression and knockdown demonstrated that it suppressed cell invasion in all six human prostate cell lines examined. Genistein decreased HCF2 expression in humans, and it was shown to increase cell invasion in all cell lines examined. The expression of MMP-2, MEK4 and BASP1 was then measured in formalin fixed prostate tissue from N = 38 Chinese men living in China and N = 41 US men living in the US, both cohorts with localized PCa. MMP-2 was 52% higher in Chinese compared to US tissue (P < 0.0001), MEK4 was 48% lower (P < 0.0001), and BASP1 was unaltered. Treatment of PC3 human PCa cells in vitro for up to 8 weeks demonstrated that short term genistein treatment decreased MMP-2, while long term treatment increased it, both changes being significant (P<0.05) compared to untreated control cells. Long term genistein-treated cells retained their responsiveness to genistein's anti-motility effect.Genistein inhibits pathways in human prostate that drive transformation to a lethal high motility phenotype. Long term treatment induces compensatory changes in biomarkers of efficacy. The current strategy of using such biomarkers after short term intervention as go/no-go determinants in early phase chemoprevention trials should be carefully examined."

This study estimated the production potential for beekeepers in Northern Uganda by quantifying current production assets (equipment and knowledge) and impact on rural income streams range of proposed interventions. Intervention scenarios evaluated the economic benefits to be derived from different hive types combined with year-round provision of a nectar source (Calliandra calothyrsus) planted at varying density. Findings show that the type and number of beehive combinations used influenced the amount of revenue streams generated by the beekeepers. Addition of 20 log hives increased incomes 10 times, 20 KTBs increased revenues 16 times and Langstroth 18 times. Adding Calliandra trees as a forage source to the baseline scenario yielded revenues up to 17.6 times higher than the baseline. Implying that good management plus the introduction of a reliable nectar source, to off-set dry season challenges (absconding), could improve beekeeping productivity in Northern Uganda. Further research is required to validate in situ the impact of modelled scenarios on both honey yield and other ecosystem service benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2926865601,"Current thought holds that factor Xa (FXa) bound in the prothrombinase complex is resistant to regulation by protein protease inhibitors during prothrombin activation. Here we provide evidence that, contrary to this view, the FXa-specific serpin inhibitor, protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI), complexed with its cofactor, protein Z (PZ), functions as a physiologically significant inhibitor of prothrombinase-bound FXa during prothrombin activation. Kinetics studies showed that the rapid rate of inhibition of FXa by the ZPI-PZ complex on procoagulant membrane vesicles (ka(app) ∼107 m−1 s−1) was decreased ∼10-fold when FXa was bound to FVa in prothrombinase and a further ∼3–4–fold when plasma levels of S195A prothrombin were present (ka(app) 2 × 105 m−1 s−1). Nevertheless, the ZPI-PZ complex produced a major inhibition of thrombin generation during prothrombinase-catalyzed activation of prothrombin under physiologically relevant conditions. The importance of ZPI-PZ complex anticoagulant regulation of FXa both before and after incorporation into prothrombinase was supported by thrombin generation assays in plasma. These showed enhanced thrombin generation when the inhibitor was neutralized with a PZ-specific antibody and decreased thrombin generation when exogenous ZPI-PZ complex was added whether prothrombin was activated directly by FXa or through extrinsic or intrinsic pathway activators. Moreover, the PZ antibody enhanced thrombin generation both in the absence and presence of activated protein C (APC) anticoagulant activity. Taken together, these results suggest an important anticoagulant role for the ZPI-PZ complex in regulating both free FXa generated in the initiation phase of coagulation as well as prothrombinase-bound FXa in the propagation phase that complement prothrombinase regulation by APC."
https://openalex.org/W2923691004,"Greatly enhanced atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels relative to well-mixed marine air are observed during periods of offshore winds at coastal sensor platforms in Monterey Bay, California, USA. The highest concentrations originate from urban and agricultural areas, are driven by diurnal winds, and peak in the early morning. These enhanced atmospheric levels can be detected across a ~100km wide nearshore area and represent a significant addition to total oceanic CO2 uptake. A global estimate puts the added sea-air flux of CO2 from these greatly enhanced atmospheric CO2 levels at 25 million tonnes, roughly 1% of the ocean’s annual CO2 uptake. The increased uptake over the 100 km coastal swath is of order 20%, indicating a potentially large impact on ocean acidification in productive coastal waters."
https://openalex.org/W2923418815,"Background Although herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are a major target for vaccine development no vaccine is currently licensed. Methods A live attenuated HSV virus vaccine, VC2 was compared to a subunit HSV vaccine, glycoprotein D (gD2) administered with the adjuvant, MPL/Alum using the guinea pig model of genital herpes. Three doses of intramuscular (IM) vaccine were provided followed by intravaginal challenge with HSV-2 at either 3 weeks or six months after the last vaccination. Results Both VC2 and gD2 vaccines reduced acute genital disease. VC2 was somewhat more effective in reducing acute vaginal replication, the amount of virus in neural tissue, subsequent recurrent disease and recurrent virus shedding following challenge at 3 weeks post vaccination. Both vaccines continued to provide protection at 6 months after vaccination but the differences between the vaccines became more pronounced in favor of the live attenuated vaccine, VC2. Significant differences in acute disease, acute vaginal virus replication, recurrent disease and recurrent virus shedding (P<0.05 for each) was observed comparing the vaccines. Re-examination of protection for this study using criteria similar to those used in recent clinical trials (inclusion of recurrent disease) showed that efficacy may not be as high in this model as previously thought prompting a need to assess the best predictive outcomes for protection in humans. Conclusion While both the live attenuated vaccine, VC2, and the gD2 subunit vaccine provided protection, the duration of protection appeared to be greater for VC2. Using the same evaluation criteria as used in human trials provided unique insights into the utility of the guinea pig model."

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) across sex and age groups and to analyze associations between demographic and socio-economic variables and ideal CVH metrics in the adult population of the Republic of Serbia. Methods Information on demographic (age, sex, marital status, and type of settlement) and socio-economic characteristics (education, and wealth index), and the 7 ideal CVH metrics (smoking, physical activity, healthy diet, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose) was obtained for 13100 respondents aged 20 years and above, from the 2013 National Health Survey in the Republic of Serbia. According to the American Heart Association, the ideal CVH was defined as the simultaneous presence of 7 ideal CVH metrics. Results Out of all ideal CVH metrics, the most prevalent components were ideal glucose (92.2%), ideal cholesterol (86.4%) and ideal smoking (63%), while the least prevalent ideal CVH component was ideal healthy diet (2.4%). Only 0.1% had all 7 CVH components at the ideal level. According to the multivariable logistic regression analysis the higher number of ideal CVH metrics was observed in women (OR = 4.46), younger people (OR = 7.12), people living without partner (OR = 1.70), more educated (OR = 2.51 for middle educated and OR = 3.57 for high educated), as well as among the rich (OR = 1.43). Conclusion Our findings of existing age-specific, sex and socio-economic differences in the prevalence and number of ideal CVH metrics should serve for the development of appropriate CVD prevention policies tailored to fit specific needs of both sexes, all age groups and people with different socioeconomic status."

Discovering the underlying structure of mental well-being is important for a full understanding of this complex construct. Using data from 3 countries (the United States, Japan, and Iran), we performed multi-dimensional scaling to analyze the representation of 9 hedonic and eudaimonic well-being variables in a 2-dimensional psychological space. The analyses revealed 2 interpretable underlying dimensions across cultures and gender groups. The first dimension—eudaimonic well-being versus hedonic well-being—is well-known to well-being researchers. The second dimension—existential relatedness versus Epicurean independence—has not been recognized before. Existential relatedness is the characteristic of being meaningfully interconnected with things other than oneself, and is mainly based on the variables positive relations with others, personal growth, purpose in life, and life satisfaction. Epicurean independence is the characteristic of being relatively free of painful experiences and not feeling the need to have ones’ views accepted by anyone but oneself. Epicurean independence is mainly based on the variables autonomy and absence of negative affect. We explain these dimensions in detail and discuss the implications for well-being research and policy."
https://openalex.org/W2923586958,"Whole-genome sequencing is a promising approach for human autosomal dominant disease studies. However, the vast number of genetic variants observed by this method constitutes a challenge when trying to identify the causal variants. This is often handled by restricting disease studies to the most damaging variants, e.g. those found in coding regions, and overlooking the remaining genetic variation. Such a biased approach explains in part why the genetic causes of many families with dominantly inherited diseases, in spite of being included in whole-genome sequencing studies, are left unsolved today. Here we explore the use of a geographically matched control population to minimize the number of candidate disease-causing variants without excluding variants based on assumptions on genomic position or functional predictions. To exemplify the benefit of the geographically matched control population we apply a typical disease variant filtering strategy in a family with an autosomal dominant form of colorectal cancer. With the use of the geographically matched control population we end up with 26 candidate variants genome wide. This is in contrast to the tens of thousands of candidates left when only making use of available public variant datasets. The effect of the local control population is dual, it (1) reduces the total number of candidate variants shared between affected individuals, and more importantly (2) increases the rate by which the number of candidate variants are reduced as additional affected family members are included in the filtering strategy. We demonstrate that the application of a geographically matched control population effectively limits the number of candidate disease-causing variants and may provide the means by which variants suitable for functional studies are identified genome wide."

https://openalex.org/W2923251896,"Novel chemical controls are needed that selectively target human, animal, and plant parasitic nematodes with reduced adverse effects on the host or the environment. We hypothesize that the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzyme family represents a potential target for development of novel nematicides and anthelmintics. To test this, we identified six PDE families present in the nematode phylum that are orthologous to six of the eleven human PDE families. We characterized the binding interactions of family-selective PDE inhibitors with human and C. elegans PDE4 in conjunction with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to evaluate differences in binding interactions of these inhibitors within the PDE4 catalytic domain. We observed that roflumilast (human PDE4-selective inhibitor) and zardaverine (selective for human PDE3 and PDE4) were 159- and 77-fold less potent, respectively, in inhibiting C. elegans PDE4. The pan-specific PDE inhibitor isobutyl methyl xanthine (IBMX) had similar affinity for nematode and human PDE4. Of 32 residues within 5 Å of the ligand binding site, five revealed significant differences in non-bonded interaction energies (van der Waals and electrostatic interaction energies) that could account for the differential binding affinities of roflumilast and zardaverine. One site (Phe506 in the human PDE4D3 amino acid sequence corresponding to Tyr253 in C. elegans PDE4) is predicted to alter the binding conformation of roflumilast and zardaverine (but not IBMX) into a less energetically favorable state for the nematode enzyme. The pharmacological differences in sensitivity to PDE4 inhibitors in conjunction with differences in the amino acids comprising the inhibitor binding sites of human and C. elegans PDE4 catalytic domains together support the feasibility of designing the next generation of anthelmintics/nematicides that could selectively bind to nematode PDEs."

Biofilm formation modifies the surfaces in favor of bacteria facilitating the survival of the bacteria under different stressed conditions. On the other hand, the formation of biofilm has a direct adverse economic impact in various industries and more importantly in medical practices. This adherence is the reason for the failure of many indwelling medical devices. Surface biofilm adhesion is the key to biofilm growth and stability. Hence this adhesion needs to be substantially lowered to inhibit biofilm stability. Both chemical and physical properties of the surface influence biofilm formation and modulating these properties can control this formation. In this study, we have investigated the effect of Hydrofluoric acid (HF), at a specific concentration as an etchant, on the surface morphology of substrates and the growth of biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. and Staphylococcus aureus. We find that the bacterial counts on the etched surfaces undergo a periodic increase and decrease. This, on one hand, shows the close correlation between the biofilm growth and the particular roughness scale, and on the other hand, explains the existing contradictory results regarding the effects of etching on substrate roughness and biofilm growth. We propose a simple model of a sequence of hole formation, hole expansion and etching away of the hole walls to form a new, comparatively smooth surface, coupled with the preferential accumulation of bacteria at the hole edges, to explain these periodicities."
https://openalex.org/W2923270166,"Allosteric ligands bind to receptors at sites that are distinct from those endogenous agonists and orthosteric pharmacological agents interact with. Both an allosteric and orthosteric ligand bind simultaneously to the receptor to form a ternary complex, where each ligand influences binding affinity of the other to the receptor, either positively or negatively. Allosteric modulators are an intensively studied group of receptor ligands because of their potentially greater selectivity over orthosteric ligands, with the possibility of fine tuning of the effects of endogenous neurotransmitters and hormones. The affinity of an unlabelled allosteric ligand is commonly estimated by measuring its effects on binding of a radio-labelled orthosteric tracer. This scenario is complicated by many folds when one studies the kinetics of interactions of two allosteric agents, added simultaneously, on binding of an orthosteric tracer. In this paper, we provide, for the first time, theoretical basis for analysis of such complex interactions. We have expanded our analysis to include the possibility of having two allosteric modulators interact with the same or different sites on the receptor. An added value of our analysis is to provide a tool to distinguish between the two situations. Finally, we also modelled binding of two molecules of one allosteric modulator to one receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2922791083,"This study tested the effect of two block setting conditions i.e., the usual block setting [US] and an anthropometry-driven block setting [AS] on the kinematic and kinetic parameters of the sprint start. Furthermore, we verified whether this effect is influenced by the relative lengths of the sprinter’s trunk and lower limbs i.e., the Cormic Index by subdividing sprinters into brachycormic, metricormic and macrocormic groups. Forty-two sprinters performed 6 maximal-effort 10 m sprints using the US and AS conditions. Dynamometric starting blocks measured forces generated by the sprinters. The times at 5 m and 10 m in the sprint trials were measured with photocells. Results showed that the anteroposterior block distances were significantly different between the two conditions (P<0.001). Across the sample, the horizontal block velocity, the rear peak force, the rear force impulse, the total force impulse, the horizontal block power, the ratio of horizontal to resultant impulse in the rear block, the first and second step lengths and the times at 5 m and 10 m improved in AS vs. US (P values from 0.05 to 0.001). Considering the interaction between the block setting condition and the Cormic Index, the rear peak force and the rear force impulse were significantly increased in the metricormic and brachycormic groups (P≤0.001) and the metricormic group (P<0.001), respectively. Kinetic variables in the rear block and the difference (Delta) in the front block/starting line distance between US and AS were related with each other (Adjusted R2 values from 0.07 to 0.36). In conclusion, AS was associated with improvement in the kinematic and kinetic parameters of the sprint start performance vs. US; however, AS is apparently best suited for metricormic sprinters. Further work is needed to verify how the sprint start kinetic and kinematic parameters are related to the front block/starting line distance and whether a block setting driven by the sprinter’s Cormic Index is able to improve sprint start performance."

Effective contraceptive adoption by these patients reduces the risks of unintended pregnancy and repeat abortion.This study uses data from the Incidence and Magnitude of Unsafe Abortion Study of 2012 to assess the level and determinants of highly effective contraception among patients treated with complications from an unsafe abortion in healthcare facilities in Kenya. Highly effective contraception was defined as any method adopted by a PAC patient that reduces pregnancy rate by over 99%.Generally, contraceptive counseling was high among all PAC patients (90%). However, only 54% of them received a modern family planning method-45% a short-acting method and 9% a long-acting and permanent method. Adoption of highly effective contraception was determined by patient's previous exposure to unintended pregnancies, induced abortion and modern family planning (FP). Facility level factors associated with the uptake of highly effective contraceptives included: facility ownership, availability of evacuation procedure room, whether the facility had a specialized obstetric-gynecologist, a facility that also had maternity services and the number of FP methods available for PAC patients.For better adoption of highly effective FP, counseling of PAC patients requires an understanding of the patient's past experience with contraception and their future fertility intentions and desires in order to meet their reproductive needs more specifically. Family planning integration with PAC can increase contraceptive uptake and improve the reproductive health of post-abortion care patients."

We developed an inclined observation technique in a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) system, based on confocal microscopy, which measures the concentration distribution in the depth direction at less than micrometre intervals. The focal plane of confocal microscopy was tilted to enable simultaneous depth scanning in the microscopic field of view inside the permeable substrate. Our system achieved real-time and non-contact depth measurement of concentration distribution in the permeable hydrogel film. Simultaneous depth concentration measurement was realised with < 1 μm/pixel resolution over a maximum depth range of 570 μm, depending on the tilt angle of the stage and optical conditions. Our system measured the concentration of fluorescence materials based on the fluorescence intensities at several depth positions with a minimum concentration resolution of 1.3 nmol/L. Applying the proposed system to real-time concentration imaging, we successfully visualised unsteady concentration transport phenomena, and estimated the mass transport coefficient through the liquid-hydrogel interface. Our findings are useful for investigating the mass transport of physical, biological, and medical phenomena in permeable substrates."
