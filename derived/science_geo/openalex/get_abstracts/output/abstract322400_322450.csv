The surface of the quantasome appears to contain four or more subunits. The molecular weight, determined from volume and density measurements, is 2 x 10(6) This is twice the minimum molecular weight calculated from the manganese content and corresponds to a chlorophyll content of 230 chlorophyll molecules per quantasome."
https://openalex.org/W1982867950,"Preliminary Ames-magnetometer data from Explorer 35, the lunar orbiter, show no evidence of a lunar bow shock. However, an increase of the magnetic field by about 1.5 gamma (over the interplanetary value) is evident on Moon's dark side, as well as dips in field strength at the limbs. Interpretation of these spatial variations in the field as deriving from plasma diamagnetism is consistent with a plasma void on the dark side, and steady-state (B = 0) magnetic transparency of Moon."

https://openalex.org/W2009874942,"Results of absorption spectra measurements on silicate glasses of various compositions indicate that ions of the first transition-metal series are present in tetrahedral and octahedral sites in silicate melts (glasses). The fractionation patterns observed for transition-metal ions between magmas and silicate minerals can be interpreted according to crystal field theory in terms of octahedral ""site preference energies"" of transition ions in crystal lattices."
https://openalex.org/W1992795396,Data for aeromagnetic profiles obtained in Antarctica during the 1963-64 austral summer were used together with earlier results to construct a map showing the areal distribution of narrow-width magnetic anomalies. Numerous anomalies are associated with known volcanic mountains in western Antarctica. A large area of few anomalies is probably a result of an extension of the thick metasedimentary section observed in the Ellsworth Mountains. Portions of the Trans-Antarctic Mountains have associated anomalies which are probably caused by late Cenozoic volcanic rocks.

Continuation of the present rate of increase, particularly with the trend to imported fuels, will lead in short order to a level of dependency on imports which is disturbing for both the national security and the balance of payments. The inevitable rise in the price of energy will presumably lead to some increases in the domestic energy supply. But our reserves, particularly in the preferred forms of petroleum, gas, and even low-sulfur coal, are finite. Thus, the energy problem must also be attacked from the standpoint of energy conservation. The forthcoming rise in fuel prices will, of course, make more attractive some forms of conservation which at present are economically marginal. Nevertheless, consumers, industry, and government will have to make difficult choices in the years ahead: between greater convenience and lower energy bills, between the high capital costs of energy conservation measures and the long-term dollar savings from increased energy efficiency, and between environmental protection and the availability of needed energy supplies. Existing capabilities and technology, on which short- and midterm improvements must be based, appear to offer substantial possibilities for reducing U.S. energy consumption within the next decade (11). Long-term solutions to the energy problem, however, will depend to a considerable extent on the continuing appearance of new technological capabilities for increased efficiency of energy utilization and increased integration of energy applications. The capacity for continuing technological advances is, of course, dependent in turn on a strong relevant scientific base. A word of caution is necessary. Recent experience has shown that technological advances alone will not solve the problem. The problem spans not only the traditional physical and engineering sciences but also those sciences which deal with human attitudes and actions, that is, the social sciences, and includes a more fundamental understanding of underlying economic principles. The challenge to all sectors of American science should be clear."

The product is a viscous oil consisting mainly of saturated and highly branched hydrocarbons containing an average of about 20 carbon atoms per molecule. This would seem to be evidence for positiveion chemical reactions in the solid state analogous to those previously reported to occur in the gaseous state at pressures above 0.01 mm-Hg. It would thus appear that the solar ionizing ultraviolet radiation (about I erg cm(-2) sec(-1) at the earth) must polymerize methane at an appreciable rate under many likely conditions.
https://openalex.org/W1989388389,"Electron-microprobe analyses across six successive sections of a single staurolite crystal show that the staurolite has three crystallographically controlled sectors, each with a distinctive content of Al, Si, Ti, Fe, Mg, and Mn. The sector distribution of elements raises the question of whether the staurolite acts as one or several phases during growth. Total analyses of the separate sectors suggest that: (i) the staurolite has tetrahedral Al substitution for Si, and (ii) the hydroxyl content varies beween sectors."

https://openalex.org/W4248582805,"Two ""gibberellin-like"" substances were present in malted wheat, compared to only one in sound, unmalted wheat. Alcoholic extracts of wheat malt fractionated by paper chromatography and bioassayed for gibberellin-like activity by three methods, indicated a new gibberellin in malted wheat. This component increased particularly in the embryo section of the sprouted wheat during the first 3 to 4 days of germination."

However, there still remains the danger that this background light (less than 5 x 10(-13) as bright as the sun) will interfere with observations of the solar corona and zodiacal light."

A difference in the oxygen isotopic composition of right-and left-coiled specimens was observed. Deposition of calcium carbonate by right-and left-coiled Foraminifera takes place, at least in the species measured, during non-coincident periods of the year."

https://openalex.org/W1987977301,"The region alpha (right ascension) equal to 23(h) 50(m) to 01(h) 30(m), delta (declination) 39 degrees 20' to 40 degrees 40' has been observed at 195 and 430 megahertz with the 1000-foot (300 m) telescope of the Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory. Eighteen sources from the Ohio Catalogue and source 3C 13 are contained in this region. We conclude that the sources have straight-line spectra with indices between -0.4 and -0.9 and that they are probably not associated with M 31, except those within the optical limit of the nebula."
