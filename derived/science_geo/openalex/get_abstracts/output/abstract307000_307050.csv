https://openalex.org/W2088481082,"Observations are reported of high-albedo soils denuded by overgrazing which appear bright, in high contrast to regions covered by natural vegetation. Measurements and modeling show that the denuded surfaces are cooler, when compared under sunlit conditions. This observed ""thermal depression"" eflect should, on theoretical grounds, result in a decreased lifting of air necessary for cloud formation and precipitation, and thus lead to regional climatic desertification."

No Caribbean species excela in all strategies, and on western Caribbean coral reefs there is a positive correlation between coral abudance and diversity. On eastern Pacific coral reefs, however. Pocillopora damicornis excludes other corals, and on these reefs there is an inverse relation between coral abundance and diversity, except in areas where distrubances, such as Acanthaster predation offset space monopolization."

About 90 percent (by weight) of the mercury released from a furnace fired with pulverized coal appears to be in the vapor phase, and 10 percent remains with the furnace residual ash. For a 700-megawatt unit, approximately 2.5 kilograms of mercury per day are released."
https://openalex.org/W1977022102,"Observations by means of conventional scuba techniques have revealed that highly modified planktonic gastropods, in the order Thecosomata, utilize a free and unsupported mucus web for collecting food particles. Their delicate bodies, quick reactions, and apparent abundance suggest that traditional plankton-sampling methods may be inadequate to assess their importance in the blue-water plankton communities."
https://openalex.org/W2795747826,"During the past 15 years, surfaces have been increasingly studied on the atomic scale. As a result, their atomic structure and composition and the dynamics of gas-surface interactions are much better understood. Modern surface science is beginning to have an impact on many technologies. Techniques are readily available to study solid-vacuum and solid-gas interfaces. Studies of solid-liquid and solid-solid interfaces are difficult and appear to be challenging frontier areas of research. Surface science is at the heart of most research and development problems in energy conversion and storage."

Preliminary estimates indicate that some New Haven plants have slightly higher than natural amounts of mercury. The burden of lead and the difficulty in removing it by washing suggest a potential for pathological significance."
https://openalex.org/W2089774173,"American eels, long-distance migrating fish, consistently exhibited conditioned cardiac deceleration responses to electric fields as small as 0.167 x 10(-2) microampere per square centimeter in water of resistivity 4000 ohm centimeters (6.7 microvolts per centimeter) and 400 ohm centimeters (0.67 microvolt per centimeter). Fewer responses were shown at this current density (0.167 x 10(-2) microampere per square centimeter) in more saline water (40 ohm centimeters, 0.067 microvolt per centimeter) and at a lower current density (0.167 x 10(-3) microampere per square centimeter) in fresh water. Thus, eels have sufficient sensitivity to utilize geoelectric information for orientation."
https://openalex.org/W2040186228,"Incipient manganese concretions occur in microcavities of planktonic skeletal debris (especially diatom frustules) in some Pacific Basin deep-sea sediments. These concretions contain over 50 percent manganese and very little iron (< 1 percent). There is a continuum of growth stages in the concretions having a diameter between 0 and approximately 2 millimeters, and a genetic relationship is suggested between the very small and the centimeter sized concretions."

https://openalex.org/W1969006749,Contrasts between the latitudinal distributions of ice-rafted debris deposited in deep-sea sediments during Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods are predicted by a new model. The model requires the existence of a restricted zone where rates of deposition of ice-rafted debris are essentially independent of glacial-interglacial cycles. Initial tests and published results show that the concept is valid in the Southern Ocean and that it provides a new means of diagnosing major migrations of climatic zones.

https://openalex.org/W2053631350,"The National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Human Rights and its 350 correspondent academy members seeks to ease the plight of individual scientists, engineers, and medical personnel suffering severe repression. It has engaged in a program of private inquiry, public remonstrance, and moral support in behalf of individuals from 11 countries. In developing this activity, members of the committee had to engage in a series of troubling issues related to the nature of human rights, the choice of cases, and the format of protest. But most troubling of all are the issues raised by the profound distortions of humanness, nationhood, and science that follow in the wake of repression."

https://openalex.org/W1988498110,"It is argued that the moonquakes recorded by sensors at the Apollo 12 landing site between December 1969 and December 1970, and which according to Latham et al. (1971) are believed to be triggered by the anomalistic lunar tide, could be triggered just as well by the latitudinal (or declination) tidal wave. Considerations are set forth which indicate that a combined latitudinal-anomalistic tidal mechanism is supported by Latham's data."
