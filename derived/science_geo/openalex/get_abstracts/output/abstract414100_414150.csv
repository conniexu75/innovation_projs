https://openalex.org/W2087431155,"Although denervation has long been implicated in aging muscle, the degree to which it is causes the fiber atrophy seen in aging muscle is unknown. To address this question, we quantified motoneuron soma counts in the lumbar spinal cord using choline acetyl transferase immunhistochemistry and quantified the size of denervated versus innervated muscle fibers in the gastrocnemius muscle using the in situ expression of the denervation-specific sodium channel, Nav1.5, in young adult (YA) and senescent (SEN) rats. To gain insights into the mechanisms driving myofiber atrophy, we also examined the myofiber expression of the two primary ubiquitin ligases necessary for muscle atrophy (MAFbx, MuRF1). MN soma number in lumbar spinal cord declined 27% between YA (638±34 MNs×mm−1) and SEN (469±13 MNs×mm−1). Nav1.5 positive fibers (1548±70 μm2) were 35% smaller than Nav1.5 negative fibers (2367±78 μm2; P<0.05) in SEN muscle, whereas Nav1.5 negative fibers in SEN were only 7% smaller than fibers in YA (2553±33 μm2; P<0.05) where no Nav1.5 labeling was seen, suggesting denervation is the primary cause of aging myofiber atrophy. Nav1.5 positive fibers had higher levels of MAFbx and MuRF1 (P<0.05), consistent with involvement of the proteasome proteolytic pathway in the atrophy of denervated muscle fibers in aging muscle. In summary, our study provides the first quantitative assessment of the contribution of denervation to myofiber atrophy in aging muscle, suggesting it explains the majority of the atrophy we observed. This striking result suggests a renewed focus should be placed on denervation in seeking understanding of the causes of and treatments for aging muscle atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2160854465,"Using stable isotope mixing models (SIMMs) as a tool to investigate the foraging ecology of animals is gaining popularity among researchers. As a result, statistical methods are rapidly evolving and numerous models have been produced to estimate the diets of animals—each with their benefits and their limitations. Deciding which SIMM to use is contingent on factors such as the consumer of interest, its food sources, sample size, the familiarity a user has with a particular framework for statistical analysis, or the level of inference the researcher desires to make (e.g., population- or individual-level). In this paper, we provide a review of commonly used SIMM models and describe a comprehensive SIMM that includes all features commonly used in SIMM analysis and two new features. We used data collected in Yosemite National Park to demonstrate IsotopeR's ability to estimate dietary parameters. We then examined the importance of each feature in the model and compared our results to inferences from commonly used SIMMs. IsotopeR's user interface (in R) will provide researchers a user-friendly tool for SIMM analysis. The model is also applicable for use in paleontology, archaeology, and forensic studies as well as estimating pollution inputs."

These characteristic aggregates are a “landmark” of the disease, but their role in the pathogenesis is still obscure. In previous works, we have shown that the C-terminal Gln/Asn-rich region (residues 321–366) of TDP-43 is involved in the interaction of this protein with other members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein protein family. Furthermore, we have shown that the interaction through this region is important for TDP-43 splicing inhibition of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator exon 9, and there were indications that it was involved in the aggregation process. Our experiments show that in cell lines and primary rat neuronal cultures, the introduction of tandem repeats carrying the 331–369-residue Gln/Asn region from TDP-43 can trigger the formation of phosphorylated and ubiquitinated aggregates that recapitulate many but not all the characteristics observed in patients. These results establish a much needed cell-based TDP-43 aggregation model useful to investigate the mechanisms involved in the formation of inclusions and the gain- and loss-of-function consequences of TDP-43 aggregation within cells. In addition, it will be a powerful tool to test novel therapeutic strategies/effectors aimed at preventing/reducing this phenomenon.

The enzymes that constitute the de novo thymidylate pathway include SHMT1, SHMT2α, thymidylate synthase (TYMS), and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Methylene-THF generated by SHMT is the one-carbon donor for the TYMS-catalyzed conversion of dUMP to thymidylate, generating dihydrofolate. DHFR catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of dihydrofolate to regenerate THF for subsequent cycles of de novo thymidylate synthesis (Fig. 1). SHMT1, TYMS, and DHFR have been localized to the nucleus, and their translocation is mediated by post-translational modification with the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) (6.Anderson D.D.

A nuclear multienzyme complex, termed the replitase, which contained some of the enzyme activities required for the de novo thymidylate cycle, including ribonucleotide reductase, TYMS, and DHFR, as well as DNA polymerase, was identified in mammalian nuclear extracts from S phase cells (20.Prem veer Reddy G.

In this study, we investigated the presence of a nuclear multienzyme complex that included SHMT and the entire de novo thymidylate pathway, and its association with the DNA replication machinery. The results of this study demonstrate that the de novo thymidylate synthesis pathway is associated with nuclear lamina and that SHMT1 or SHMT2α serve essential roles as scaffold proteins for complex formation. Furthermore, this metabolic complex is enriched at sites of DNA replication initiation, indicating that de novo thymidine nucleotide synthesis occurs at the sites of DNA synthesis.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that the de novo thymidylate synthesis pathway is present in the nucleus as a metabolic complex associated with the nuclear lamina and that SHMT1 and SHMT2α anchor the de novo thymidylate synthesis metabolic complex to the nuclear lamina. Previous studies have shown that de novo thymidylate synthesis activity in isolated nuclei is impaired following sonication, indicating a role for nuclear architecture in thymidylate synthesis (6.Anderson D.D. Stover P.J. SHMT1 and SHMT2 are functionally redundant in nuclear de novo thymidylate biosynthesis.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The results of this study provide a mechanism for this observation by demonstrating that SHMT1 and SHMT2α are lamin-binding proteins that serve as scaffold proteins that are essential for assembly of the de novo thymidylate synthesis pathway into a multienzyme complex in the nucleus.The SHMT1 scaffold function probably accounts for its role as a limiting factor for de novo thymidylate biosynthesis in cell culture and mouse models (11.Oppenheim E.W. Adelman C. Liu X. Stover P.J. Heavy chain ferritin enhances serine hydroxymethyltransferase expression and de novo thymidine biosynthesis.J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38381-38389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Uracil levels in nuclear DNA, which are a proxy for thymidylate synthesis capacity, are elevated in Shmt1+/− mice compared with wild-type littermates (12.MacFarlane A.J. Liu X. Perry C.A. Flodby P. Allen R.H. Stabler S.P. Stover P.J. Cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase regulates the metabolic partitioning of methylenetetrahydrofolate but is not essential in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25846-25853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), demonstrating a key role of this enzyme in determining thymidylate synthesis capacity in vivo. The results from this study indicate that the scaffold function of SHMT may be a more important determinant of de novo thymidylate biosynthesis capacity than its catalytic activity. Expression of a dominant negative SHMT1 that lacked catalytic activity but retained lamin binding activity in neuroblastoma reduced the incorporation of SHMT1-derived one-carbon units into methionine synthesis, which occurs in the cytoplasm, but enhanced the incorporation of SHMT1-derived one-carbon units into de novo thymidylate synthesis, which occurs in the nucleus. Furthermore, the identification of MTHFD1 as a component of the nuclear thymidylate biosynthesis complex indicates that formate may be an important source of nuclear methylene-THF for de novo thymidylate biosynthesis.These data also support a role for de novo thymidylate biosynthesis at the sites of nuclear DNA synthesis. TYMS and DHFR, like SHMT1, were shown to be present in the nucleus only during S and G2/M phases and thereby enable nuclear de novo thymidylate synthesis during DNA replication and repair. The nuclear lamina has been observed to play an important role in tethering DNA to the nuclear periphery during replication and repair, and in this study, it is shown to support the formation of the de novo thymidylate synthesis multienzyme complex. The results of this study also indicate that de novo thymidylate biosynthesis occurs at the sites of DNA synthesis and is associated with the DNA replication machinery. SHMT1 was shown to interact with PCNA, RFC1, and the DNA polymerases δ and ϵ, and PCNA was shown to interact with SHMT1, TYMS, and DHFR. SHMT1, TYMS, and DHFR proteins are associated with replicating DNA and are enriched at sites of DNA replication initiation.Thymidine nucleotides are unique from the other nucleotides required for DNA replication. They are not essential during DNA replication, because dUTP can be incorporated into DNA in lieu of dTTP. Furthermore, although all other nucleotide synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm, we have shown that the de novo thymidylate biosynthesis pathway localizes to the nucleus and that its presence in the nucleus is essential to prevent uracil accumulation in nuclear DNA (10.Macfarlane A.J. Anderson D.D. Flodby P. Perry C.A. Allen R.H. Stabler S.P. Stover P.J. Nuclear localization of de novo thymidylate biosynthesis pathway is required to prevent uracil accumulation in DNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 44015-44022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The finding that SHMT1 is an essential scaffold for the formation of the de novo thymidylate biosynthesis multicomplex accounts for the sensitivity of Shmt+/− mice to increased uracil misincorporation in DNA, increased risk of intestinal cancer (26.Macfarlane A.J.

Furthermore, the nuclear compartmentation of de novo thymidylate biosynthesis at the replication fork may permit the regulation of dUTP incorporation into DNA, as opposed to its misincorporation in DNA, for the regulation of transcriptional networks and biological pathways, as has been demonstrated in Drosophila (33.Deutsch W.A.

The enzymes that constitute the de novo thymidylate pathway include SHMT1, SHMT2α, thymidylate synthase (TYMS), and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Methylene-THF generated by SHMT is the one-carbon donor for the TYMS-catalyzed conversion of dUMP to thymidylate, generating dihydrofolate. DHFR catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of dihydrofolate to regenerate THF for subsequent cycles of de novo thymidylate synthesis (Fig. 1). SHMT1, TYMS, and DHFR have been localized to the nucleus, and their translocation is mediated by post-translational modification with the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) (6.Anderson D.D.

https://openalex.org/W2066780692,"The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) serves an important role in coordinating stage-specific recruitment and release of cellular machines during transcription. Dynamic placement and removal of phosphorylation marks on different residues of a repeating heptapeptide (YSPTSPS) of the CTD underlies the engagement of relevant cellular machinery. Whereas sequential placement of phosphorylation marks is well explored, genome-wide engagement of phosphatases that remove these CTD marks is poorly understood. In particular, identifying the enzyme that erases phospho-Ser7 (Ser7-P) marks is especially important, because we find that substituting this residue with a glutamate, a phospho-mimic, is lethal. Our observations implicate Ssu72 as a Ser7-P phosphatase. We report that removal of all phospho-CTD marks during transcription termination is mechanistically coupled. An inability to remove these marks prevents Pol II from terminating efficiently and will likely impede subsequent assembly into the pre-initiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W2033007319,"Background Few studies have considered in detail the range of biosecurity practices undertaken on cattle farms, particularly within the UK. In this study, 56 cattle farmers in a 100 km2 area of north-west England were questioned regarding their on-farm biosecurity practices, including those relating to animal movements, equipment sharing and companies and contractors visiting the farms. Methodology/Principal Findings There was great variation between farms in terms of the type of, and extent to which, biosecurity was carried out. For example, the majority of farmers did not isolate stock bought onto the farm, but a small proportion always isolated stock. Many farmers administered treatments post-movement, primarily vaccinations and anthelmintics, but very few farms reported carrying out any health checks after moving animals on. In addition, there appeared to be much variation in the amount of biosecurity carried out by the different companies and contractors visiting the farms. Deadstock collectors and contracted animal waste spreaders, although likely to have a high potential for contact with infectious agents, were reported to infrequently disinfect themselves and their vehicles. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that although certain biosecurity practices are undertaken, many are carried out infrequently or not at all. This may be due to many factors, including cost (in time and money), lack of proven efficacies of practices and lack of relevant education of veterinary surgeons, producers and other herd health specialists. Further research exploring the reasons for the lack of uptake is imperative if preventive medicine is to be utilised fully by the farming industry."
https://openalex.org/W2069493137,"ETS-related gene (ERG) is a member of the ETS transcription factor family. Our previous studies have shown that ERG expression is highly enriched in endothelial cells (EC) both in vitro and in vivo. ERG expression is markedly repressed in response to inflammatory stimuli. It has been shown that ERG is a positive regulator of several EC-restricted genes including VE-cadherin, endoglin, and von Willebrand factor, and a negative regulator of other genes such as interleukin (IL)-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. In this study we have identified a novel role for ERG in the regulation of EC barrier function. ERG knockdown results in marked increases in EC permeability. This is associated with a significant increase of stress fiber and gap formation in EC. Furthermore, we identify CLDN5 as a downstream target of ERG in EC. Thus, our results suggest that ERG plays a pivotal role in regulating EC barrier function and that this effect is mediated in part through its regulation of CLDN5 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2069381818,"Cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease (AD) is increasingly attributed to the neuronal impact of soluble oligomers of the amyloid-β peptide (AβOs). Current knowledge on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of AβOs stems largely from rodent-derived cell/tissue culture experiments or from transgenic models of AD, which do not necessarily recapitulate the complexity of the human disease. Here, we used DNA microarray and RT-PCR to investigate changes in transcription in adult human cortical slices exposed to sublethal doses of AβOs. The results revealed a set of 27 genes that showed consistent differential expression upon exposure of slices from three different donors to AβOs. Functional classification of differentially expressed genes revealed that AβOs impact pathways important for neuronal physiology and known to be dysregulated in AD, including vesicle trafficking, cell adhesion, actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and insulin signaling. Most genes (70%) were down-regulated by AβO treatment, suggesting a predominantly inhibitory effect on the corresponding pathways. Significantly, AβOs induced down-regulation of synaptophysin, a presynaptic vesicle membrane protein, suggesting a mechanism by which oligomers cause synapse failure. The results provide insight into early mechanisms of pathogenesis of AD and suggest that the neuronal pathways affected by AβOs may be targets for the development of novel diagnostic or therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W1977333753,"IL-21 is a class I cytokine that exerts pleiotropic effects on both innate and adaptive immune responses. It signals through a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) and the common γ-chain. A hallmark of the class I cytokine receptors is the class I cytokine receptor signature motif (WSXWS). The exact role of this motif has not been determined yet; however, it has been implicated in diverse functions, including ligand binding, receptor internalization, proper folding, and export, as well as signal transduction. Furthermore, the WXXW motif is known to be a consensus sequence for C-mannosylation. Here, we present the crystal structure of IL-21 bound to IL-21R and reveal that the WSXWS motif of IL-21R is C-mannosylated at the first tryptophan. We furthermore demonstrate that a sugar chain bridges the two fibronectin domains that constitute the extracellular domain of IL-21R and anchors at the WSXWS motif through an extensive hydrogen bonding network, including mannosylation. The glycan thus transforms the V-shaped receptor into an A-frame. This finding offers a novel structural explanation of the role of the class I cytokine signature motif."
https://openalex.org/W2022654795,"Ultrasonic technologies pervade the medical field: as a long established imaging modality in clinical diagnostics; and, with the emergence of targeted high intensity focused ultrasound, as a means of thermally ablating tumours. In parallel, the potential of [non-thermal] intermediate intensity ultrasound as a minimally invasive therapy is also being rigorously assessed. Here, induction of apoptosis in cancer cells has been observed, although definitive identification of the underlying mechanism has thus far remained elusive. A likely candidate process has been suggested to involve sonochemical activity, where reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate the generation of DNA single-strand breaks. Here however, we provide compelling new evidence that strongly supports a purely mechanical mechanism. Moreover, by a combination of specific assays (neutral comet tail and staining for γH2AX foci formation) we demonstrate for the first time that US exposure at even moderate intensities exhibits genotoxic potential, through its facility to generate DNA damage across multiple cancer lines. Notably, colocalization assays highlight that ionizing radiation and ultrasound have distinctly different signatures to their respective γH2AX foci formation patterns, likely reflecting the different stress distributions that initiated damage formation. Furthermore, parallel immuno-blotting suggests that DNA-PKcs have a preferential role in the repair of ultrasound-induced damage."
https://openalex.org/W2037882240,"α-Synuclein is causative for autosomal dominant familial Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, and the phosphorylation of α-synuclein at residue Ser-129 is a key posttranslational modification detected in Parkinson disease/dementia with Lewy bodies lesions. However, the role of Ser-129 phosphorylation on the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease/dementia with Lewy bodies remains unclear. Here we investigated the neurotoxicity of Ser-129-substituted α-synuclein in the transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (Tg worm) model of synucleinopathy. Tg worms pan-neuronally overexpressing nonphosphorylatable (S129A) α-synuclein showed severe defects including motor dysfunction, growth retardation, and synaptic abnormalities. In contrast, Tg worms expressing phosphorylation mimic (S129D) α-synuclein exhibited nearly normal phenotypes. Biochemical fractionation revealed that the level of membrane-bound α-synuclein was significantly increased in S129A-α-synuclein Tg worms, whereas S129D- as well as A30P-α-synuclein displayed lower membrane binding properties. Furthermore, A30P/S129A double mutant α-synuclein did not cause neuronal dysfunction and displayed low membrane binding property. In human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, localization of S129A-α-synuclein to membranes was significantly increased. Finally, gene expression profiling of S129A-Tg worms revealed a dramatic up-regulation of Daf-16/FOXO pathway genes, which likely act against the dysfunction caused by S129A-α-synuclein. These results imply a role of Ser-129 phosphorylation of α-synuclein in the attenuation of α-synuclein-induced neuronal dysfunction and downstream stress response by lowering the membrane binding property."
https://openalex.org/W2004293180,"Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with adverse medical consequences, including cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Patients with MDD may be classified as having melancholic, atypical, or undifferentiated features. The goal of the present study was to assess whether these clinical subtypes of depression have different endocrine and metabolic features and consequently, varying medical outcomes. Methods Premenopausal women, ages 21 to 45 years, with MDD (N = 89) and healthy controls (N = 44) were recruited for a prospective study of bone turnover. Women with MDD were classified as having melancholic (N = 51), atypical (N = 16), or undifferentiated (N = 22) features. Outcome measures included: metabolic parameters, body composition, bone mineral density (BMD), and 24 hourly sampling of plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), cortisol, and leptin. Results Compared with control subjects, women with undifferentiated and atypical features of MDD exhibited greater BMI, waist/hip ratio, and whole body and abdominal fat mass. Women with undifferentiated MDD characteristics also had higher lipid and fasting glucose levels in addition to a greater prevalence of low BMD at the femoral neck compared to controls. Elevated ACTH levels were demonstrated in women with atypical features of depression, whereas higher mean 24-hour leptin levels were observed in the melancholic subgroup. Conclusions Pre-menopausal women with various features of MDD exhibit metabolic, endocrine, and BMD features that may be associated with different health consequences.

https://openalex.org/W1541308622,"Vinculin, an actin-binding protein, is emerging as an important regulator of adherens junctions. In focal-adhesions, vinculin is activated by simultaneous binding of talin to its head domain and actin filaments to its tail domain. Talin is not present in adherens junctions. Consequently, the identity of the ligand that activates vinculin in cell-cell junctions is not known. Here we show that in the presence of F-actin, α-catenin, a cytoplasmic component of the cadherin adhesion complex, activates vinculin. Direct binding of α-catenin to vinculin is critical for this event because a point mutant (α-catenin L344P) lacking high affinity binding does not activate vinculin. Furthermore, unlike all known vinculin activators, α-catenin binds to and activates vinculin independently of an A50I substitution in the vinculin head, a mutation that inhibits vinculin binding to talin and IpaA. Collectively, these data suggest that α-catenin employs a novel mechanism to activate vinculin and may explain how vinculin is differentially recruited and/or activated in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions.

Developmental and cellular cues alter cell-cell adhesion by facilitating the assembly and disassembly of protein complexes at the cadherins cytoplasmic tail (7.Niessen C.M. Gottardi C.J. Molecular components of the adherens junction.Biochim Biophys Acta. 2008; 1778: 562-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), but the molecular events that regulate these processes remain poorly understood. Vinculin is recruited to the cadherin adhesion complex by binding to β-catenin, and it governs cadherin function. For example, our laboratory showed that vinculin is required for stabilizing E-cadherin on the cell surface and that in its absence, cell-cell junctions do not properly assemble (8.Peng X. Cuff L.E. Lawton C.D. DeMali K.A. Vinculin regulates cell surface E-cadherin expression by binding to β-catenin.J. Cell Science. 2010; 123: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Similarly, conditional knock-out of vinculin in the cardiomyocytes of mice resulted in disrupted N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions and depolarized localization of gap junctions (9.Zemljic-Harpf A.E. Miller J.C. Henderson S.A. Wright A.T. Manso A.M. Elsherif L. Dalton N.D. Thor A.K. Perkins G.A. McCulloch A.D. Ross R.S.

Others demonstrated that vinculin acts downstream of myosin VI to regulate the maturation of cell-cell adhesions (10.Maddugoda M.P. Crampton M.S. Shewan A.M. Yap A.S. Myosin VI and vinculin cooperate during the morphogenesis of cadherin cell cell contacts in mammalian epithelial cells.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating the assembly and maintenance of junctions, vinculin is critical for E-cadherin-mediated mechanosensing (11.le Duc Q. Shi Q. Blonk I. Sonnenberg A. Wang N. Leckband D. de Rooij J. Vinculin potentiates E-cadherin mechanosensing and is recruited to actin-anchored sites within adherens junctions in a myosin II-dependent manner.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 189: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). These studies establish vinculin as a critical component of the cadherin adhesion complex, but how vinculin is regulated at this site is not known. Vinculin has no enzymatic activity; rather it functions by binding to other proteins. For example, efficient membrane protrusion requires transient recruitment of the Arp2/3 complex to vinculin in adhesions in the leading edge of spreading cells (12.DeMali K.A. Burridge K. Coupling membrane protrusion and cell adhesion.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2389-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), whereas the extent of integrin clustering requires vinculin binding to both talin and actin (13.Humphries J.D. Wang P.

Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1043-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). In order for vinculin to bind ligands, an inactivating intramolecular interaction between its head and tail domains must be relieved (14.Johnson R.P. Craig S.W.

The relaxation of this intramolecular interaction has been termed vinculin activation. In cell-matrix or focal adhesions, the mechanism for vinculin activation is somewhat controversial with some groups proposing that a single ligand, talin, activates vinculin and others demonstrating a requirement for talin and actin filaments (17.Izard T.

Talin is not present in adherens junctions. Therefore, another ligand must activate vinculin in this region of the cell. In this study, we tested whether α- or β-catenin, two cadherin adhesion complex components that bind vinculin, can activate it (23.Hazan R.B. Kang L. Roe S. Borgen P.I. Rimm D.L.

We found that α-catenin, but not β-catenin, activates vinculin, and that this activation requires binding of vinculin to actin filaments. We generated an α-catenin point mutant that does not bind vinculin and found that vinculin activation requires direct binding to α-catenin. Furthermore, we report that α-catenin, unlike all the other known vinculin activators, binds and activates vinculin in the presence of an A50I substitution in the vinculin head. These data suggest that α-catenin employs a distinct and novel mechanism to activate vinculin. In addition, the results provide new evidence for stable activation of vinculin by coincident action of two ligands. pEGFP-V1–1066± A50I, pEGFP-V1–851± A50I are previously described (16.Cohen D.M.

The emission spectra of fluorescent proteins in the lysate were acquired at 20 °C with a Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ). Cerulean emission was traced from 460 to 600 nm with excitation at 440 nm, and Citrine emission was traced from 510 to 600 nm with excitation at 490 nm. The increment was 1 nm, and integration was 0.2 s. The excitation and emission slit widths were 3 mm and 5 mm, respectively. Lysate from an equal number of untransfected HEK293 cells was used to obtain a background emission spectrum. The raw FRET signal is the Citrine emission (peak at 525) stimulated by excitation of Cerulean at 440 nm. It consists of the sensitized emission (SE), 3The abbreviations used are: SEsensitized emissionERemission ratioVBSvinculin binding site. the emission from direct excitation of citrine by 440 nm, and the overlap of the cerulean emission spectrum with the citrine emission spectrum. The latter two components of the raw FRET signal are referred to as “spectral cross-talk”. The amount of spectral cross-talk was determined as previously described (20.Chen H. Cohen D.M.

The corrected FRET emission ratio (ER) is the ratio of the sensitized emission at 525 nm to the emission at 475 nm, after correcting for the citrine and cerulean cross-talk. ER is SE/Fda, where SE is the sensitized emission and Fda is the fluorescence of the donor in the presence of the acceptor. SE/Fda correlates directly with FRET efficiency (20.Chen H. Cohen D.M.

After elution, all the proteins were dialyzed against FP buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl). Proteins were concentrated using the Amicon Ultra 3,000 MWCO system (Millipore) and stored at 4 °C. 50 μg of purified GST, or GST-FL α-catenin, or GST-α-catenin truncations bound to the glutathione-Sepharose were incubated with MDCK cell lysate at 4 °C for 1.5 h. The recovered proteins were washed, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. Purified GST, GST-α-catenin 273–510, GST-α-catenin 273–510 L344P, GST-FL α-catenin, or GST-FL α-catenin L344P (5 μm) was incubated with 1.5 μm His6-vinculin 1–398 or His6-vinculin 1–398 A50I in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF) at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose, that had been preincubated with 5 μm BSA at 4 °C for 30 min. The recovered proteins were washed, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. HEK 293 cells were detached with 1 mm EDTA in calcium- and magnesium-free PBS at 37 °C for 20 min. The pelleted cells were resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm PMSF) and at a density of 2 to 4 × 106 cells/ml, incubated on ice for 20 min, and homogenized manually. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C, 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and then subjected to another centrifugation at 25 °C, 80,000 rpm for 30 min. Lysates were mixed with designated purified protein at room temperature for 1 h. Samples were spun at 25 °C, 80,000 rpm for 30 min. Equivalent amounts of total sample before spin (T), supernatant (S), and pellet (P) fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and recognized with hVIN1 and C4 monoclonal antibodies to vinculin (Sigma) and actin (Millipore), respectively. The amount of GFP-tagged vinculin in the pellet to the total (pellet/total) was quantified using densitometry and expressed as a ratio. The data presented in the graph are the mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments. HEK293 cells were lysed as described in actin cosedimentation assay. The cell lysate containing GFP-V1–851 or GFP-V1–851 A50I was incubated with increasing concentration of His6-tagged α-catenin 273–510 for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose. The unbound GFP-V1–851 or GFP-V1–851 A50I was separated from the bound fraction by centrifugation and assayed for concentration by spectrofluorimetry. The fraction of GFP-V1–851 or GFP-V1–851 A50I in complex with α-catenin 273–510 was plotted against unbound protein. Data were fitted to the equation Bmax × X/(Kd + X) using Sigmaplot software, where Bmax = maximum fraction of receptor capable of binding to ligand. The data presented in the graph are the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. 1 μm purified His-tagged α-catenin 273–510, 1 μm full-length vinculin, and 5 μm skeletal muscle F-actin were mixed together in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF) at room temperature for 30 min. The mixtures were then incubated with GST Vinexin (amino acids 42–155) bound to glutathione beads that had been blocked with 5 μm BSA overnight at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged and the supernatant harvested and saved as the soluble (S) fraction. The beads were then washed and the pellet (P) was recovered. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. HEK293 cells were lysed as described in the actin cosedimentation assay. Cell lysates were incubated with indicated purified protein(s) for 1 h at room temperature. GFP was then immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal GFP antibody (Roche) at 4 °C, and the immunoprecipitates were washed four times in lysis buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF, and subjected to Western blot analysis with the appropriate antibody: the p34-Arc subunit of the Arp2/3 complex was blotted using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide that encompassed amino acids 179–204 of p34-Arc (25.DeMali K.A.

Ponsin was blotted using a rabbit antibody raised against synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 192–206 of human CAP (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). GFP was blotted with a mouse monoclonal antibody (Roche). Actin was blotted with a mouse monoclonal antibody (clone C4, MP Biomedicals). The blots were developed using ECL Western blot detection reagents (Pierce), and the signal was detected on x-ray film (Kodak). In adherens junctions α- and β-catenin bind to the vinculin head domain suggesting that one or both of these proteins might activate vinculin (24.Watabe-Uchida M. Uchida N. Imamura Y. Nagafuchi A.

We tested whether vinculin is activated by either catenin. When vinculin is activated, it binds to actin filaments (16.Cohen D.M. Chen H. Johnson R.P. Choudhury B. Craig S.W.

Consequently, vinculin activation has reliably been measured by examining the ability of vinculin to co-sediment with actin filaments (16.Cohen D.M. Chen H. Johnson R.P. Choudhury B. Craig S.W.

We examined whether α- or β-catenin could induce vinculin to co-sediment with actin filaments. For most of these studies, we employed an α-catenin fragment 273–510 that binds vinculin because the full-length protein forms intramolecular interactions that preclude access to the vinculin binding site (27.Janssen M.E. Kim E. Liu H. Fujimoto L.M. Bobkov A. Volkmann N. Hanein D. Three-dimensional structure of vinculin bound to actin filaments.Mol.

Shibata M. α-Catenin as a tension transducer that induces adherens junction development.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Also, full-length α-catenin dimer binds actin and this would prevent knowing whether a ternary complex of vinculin, α-catenin, and actin is present in pellets of actin co-sedimentation assays. When cell lysate containing full length EGFP-vinculin was incubated with purified actin filaments and then centrifuged at speeds sufficient to sediment actin filaments, little to no vinculin co-sedimented with actin filaments alone (Fig. 1, A and C and Ref. 22.Chen H. Choudhury D.M. Craig S.W. Coincidence of actin filaments and talin is required to activate vinculin.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40389-40398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The addition of α-catenin 273–510 to the mixtures of vinculin and actin triggered large amounts of vinculin to pellet with actin filaments (Fig. 1, A and C). This effect was specific for α-catenin as little or no vinculin sedimented when β-catenin was added (Fig. 1B). Similar results were found in parallel experiments using FRET probes that report on vinculin activation and actin-binding in cell lysates (16.Cohen D.M. Chen H. Johnson R.P. Choudhury B. Craig S.W.

Chem. 2005; 280: 17109-17117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 20.Chen H. Cohen D.M. Choudhury D.M. Kioka N. Craig S.W.

For these studies, we employed a vinculin FRET probe, TP3, that contains Citrine inserted before the tail domain and Cerulean on the C terminus, in place of YFP and CFP in the original TP2 construct (20.Chen H. Cohen D.M. Choudhury D.M. Kioka N. Craig S.W. Spatial distribution and functional significance of activated vinculin in living cells.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). When vinculin is in the closed conformation, the two fluorophores in this probe are in close contact, which gives a high FRET signal; after vinculin activation and binding to actin, the FRET signal reduces because the binding of actin to vinculin tail domain forces the two fluorophores away from one another (20.Chen H. Cohen D.M. Choudhury D.M. Kioka N. Craig S.W. Spatial distribution and functional significance of activated vinculin in living cells.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We found that the FRET probe has a strong fluorescent signal by itself; the addition of 5 μm actin filaments alone, or purified α-catenin 273–510 had little effect on the FRET signal (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the addition of both actin filaments and α-catenin 273–510 induced a significant reduction in the FRET signal (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, α-catenin activation of vinculin was dose dependent with a half-maximal activation observed at 3 μm α-catenin 273–510 (Fig. 1E). Like wild type vinculin, the vinculin FRET probe also co-sediments with actin in the presence of α-catenin or IpaA (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, α-catenin activates vinculin. To determine whether α-catenin 273–510 activates vinculin for binding to its ligands and to evaluate whether actin is required for this event, we tested whether vinculin bound ponsin, a component of the nectin based adhesions, or the Arp2/3 complex, a potent nucleator of actin polymerization. Both of these ligands bind to sites in the proline-rich region of vinculin and previous studies show that vinculin co-immunoprecipitates with these proteins only when its inactivating intramolecular head-tail interaction has been relieved (12.DeMali K.A. Burridge K. Coupling membrane protrusion and cell adhesion.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2389-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 29.Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. Ponsin/SH3P12: an l-afadin- and vinculin-binding protein localized at cell-cell and cell-matrix adherens junctions.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1001-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In the absence of α-catenin 273–510 or actin filaments, neither ponsin nor the Arp2/3 complex was recovered with vinculin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1F). In the presence of both α-catenin 273–510 and actin, ponsin, and the Arp2/3 complex were recruited to vinculin (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these results show that α-catenin activates vinculin for binding to Arp2/3 and ponsin and that this activation requires actin filaments. To ensure that vinculin activation by α-catenin did not require other proteins present in the cell lysates, we tested whether the activation could be recapitulated in vitro using purified proteins. We monitored activation by examining vinculin binding to the SH3 domain of vinexin. We found that only a small fraction of vinculin bound vinexin when α-catenin 273–510 alone or F-actin alone were present. When both α-catenin and F-actin were present, a large percentage of vinculin bound to GST-vinexin (Fig. 1G). These results indicate that purified α-catenin activates vinculin and rules out the possibility that other constituents of the lysates are responsible (Fig. 1G). Hence, α-catenin, like talin, employs a combinatorial mechanism to fully activate vinculin. To explore whether direct binding of α-catenin to vinculin is required for activation, we considered generating a mutant form of α-catenin that could not bind vinculin. We mapped the vinculin-binding site on α-catenin using a series of α-catenin fragments expressed as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 2A). Previous studies showed vinculin binds to a region of α-catenin that contains amino acids 273–510 (27.Janssen M.E. Kim E. Liu H. Fujimoto L.M. Bobkov A. Volkmann N. Hanein D.

Here we employed a comprehensive array of clinically relevant in vivo MRI techniques to identify early markers of cardiac dysfunction and follow disease progression in the hearts of mdx mice. Methods and Results Serial measurements of cardiac morphology and function were made in the same group of mdx mice and controls (housed in a non-SPF facility) using MRI at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after birth. Left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) systolic and diastolic function, response to dobutamine stress and myocardial fibrosis were assessed. RV dysfunction preceded LV dysfunction, with RV end systolic volumes increased and RV ejection fractions reduced at 3 months of age. LV ejection fractions were reduced at 12 months, compared with controls. An abnormal response to dobutamine stress was identified in the RV of mdx mice as early as 1 month. Late-gadolinium-enhanced MRI identified increased levels of myocardial fibrosis in 6, 9 and 12-month-old mdx mice, the extent of fibrosis correlating with the degree of cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy. Conclusions MRI could identify cardiac abnormalities in the RV of mdx mice as young as 1 month, and detected myocardial fibrosis at 6 months. We believe these to be the earliest MRI measurements of cardiac function reported for any mice, and the first use of late-gadolinium-enhancement in a mouse model of congenital cardiomyopathy. These techniques offer a sensitive and clinically relevant in vivo method for assessment of cardiomyopathy caused by muscular dystrophy and other diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2059133557,"Background Asthma is a common complex condition with clear racial and ethnic differences in both prevalence and severity. Asthma consultation rates, mortality, and severe symptoms are greatly increased in African descent populations of developed countries. African ancestry has been associated with asthma, total serum IgE and lower pulmonary function in African-admixed populations. To replicate previous findings, here we aimed to examine whether African ancestry was associated with asthma susceptibility in African Americans. In addition, we examined for the first time whether African ancestry was associated with asthma exacerbations. Methodology/Principal Findings After filtering for self-reported ancestry and genotype data quality, samples from 1,117 self-reported African-American individuals from New York and Baltimore (394 cases, 481 controls), and Chicago (321 cases followed for asthma exacerbations) were analyzed. Genetic ancestry was estimated based on ancestry informative markers (AIMs) selected for being highly divergent among European and West African populations (95 AIMs for New York and Baltimore, and 66 independent AIMs for Chicago). Among case-control samples, the mean African ancestry was significantly higher in asthmatics than in non-asthmatics (82.0±14.0% vs. 77.8±18.1%, mean difference 4.2% [95% confidence interval (CI):2.0–6.4], p<0.0001). This association remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders (odds ratio: 4.55, 95% CI: 1.69–12.29, p = 0.003). African ancestry failed to show an association with asthma exacerbations (p = 0.965) using a model based on longitudinal data of the number of exacerbations followed over 1.5 years. Conclusions/Significance These data replicate previous findings indicating that African ancestry constitutes a risk factor for asthma and suggest that elevated asthma rates in African Americans can be partially attributed to African genetic ancestry."

Porcine Bim had three alternative splicing variants (Bim-extra long, Bim-long, and Bim-short), all containing the consensus Bcl-2 homology 3 domain. We then found the Bim-extra long (BimEL) protein, the most abundant isoform of Bim, was strongly expressed and co-localized with apoptotic (TUNEL-positive) granulosa cells from porcine atretic follicles. Furthermore, overexpression of BimEL triggered apoptosis in granulosa cells. In primary granulosa cell cultures under basal conditions, we observed that BimEL expression was dampened by treatment with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).

Four groups of autotoxic compounds from the aqueous extracts of the fibrous roots were isolated and characterized. The ethyl acetate extracts of these water-soluble compounds were further analyzed and separated into five fractions. Among them, the most autotoxic fraction (Fr 3) was subjected to GC/MS analysis, resulting in 32 identified compounds. Based on literature, nine compounds were selected for testing their autotoxic effects on radicle growth. Seven out of the nine compounds were phenolic, which significantly reduced radicle growth in a concentration-dependent manner. The other two were aliphatic compounds that showed a moderate inhibition effect at three concentrations. Concentration of these compounds in soil samples was determined by HPLC. Furthermore, the autotoxic compounds were also found in the top soil of the commercially cultivated Rehmannia fields. It appears that a close link exists between the autotoxic effects on the seedlings and the compounds extracted from fibrous roots of Rehmannia."
https://openalex.org/W1964345483,"Background Improved maps of species distributions are important for effective management of wildlife under increasing anthropogenic pressures. Recent advances in lidar and radar remote sensing have shown considerable potential for mapping forest structure and habitat characteristics across landscapes. However, their relative efficacies and integrated use in habitat mapping remain largely unexplored. We evaluated the use of lidar, radar and multispectral remote sensing data in predicting multi-year bird detections or prevalence for 8 migratory songbird species in the unfragmented temperate deciduous forests of New Hampshire, USA. Methodology and Principal Findings A set of 104 predictor variables describing vegetation vertical structure and variability from lidar, phenology from multispectral data and backscatter properties from radar data were derived. We tested the accuracies of these variables in predicting prevalence using Random Forests regression models. All data sets showed more than 30% predictive power with radar models having the lowest and multi-sensor synergy (“fusion”) models having highest accuracies. Fusion explained between 54% and 75% variance in prevalence for all the birds considered. Stem density from discrete return lidar and phenology from multispectral data were among the best predictors. Further analysis revealed different relationships between the remote sensing metrics and bird prevalence. Spatial maps of prevalence were consistent with known habitat preferences for the bird species. Conclusion and Significance Our results highlight the potential of integrating multiple remote sensing data sets using machine-learning methods to improve habitat mapping. Multi-dimensional habitat structure maps such as those generated from this study can significantly advance forest management and ecological research by facilitating fine-scale studies at both stand and landscape level."
https://openalex.org/W1991998407,"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis stress response factor SigH plays a crucial role in modulating the pathogen's response to heat, oxidative-stress, envelope damage and hypoxia. We hypothesized that the lack of this key stress response factor would alter the interaction between the pathogen and its host cells. We compared the interaction of Mtb, Mtb:Δ-sigH and a strain where the mutation had been genetically complemented (Mtb: Δ-sigH:CO) with primary rhesus macaque bone marrow derived macrophages (Rh-BMDMs). The expression of numerous inducible and homeostatic (CCL) β-chemokines and several apoptotic markers was induced to higher levels in the cells infected with Mtb:Δ-sigH, relative to Mtb or the complemented strain. The differential expression of these genes manifested into functional differences in chemotaxis and apoptosis in cells infected with these two strains. The mutant strain also exhibited reduced late-stage survival in Rh-BMDMs. We hypothesize that the product of one or more SigH-dependent genes may modulate the innate interaction of Mtb with host cells, effectively reducing the chemokine-mediated recruitment of immune effector cells, apoptosis of infected monocytes and enhancing the long-term survival and replication of the pathogen in this milieu The significantly higher induction of Prostaglandin Synthetase 2 (PTGS2 or COX2) in Rh-BMDMs infected with Mtb relative to Mtb: Δ-sigH may explain reduced apoptosis in Mtb-infected cells, as PTGS2 is known to inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis.The SigH-regulon modulates the innate interaction of Mtb with host phagocytes, perhaps as part of a strategy to limit its clearance and prolong its survival. The SigH regulon appears to be required to modulate innate immune responses directed against Mtb."

Binding of the talin FERM (four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain to the integrin β tail provides one key activation signal, but recent data indicate that the kindlin family of FERM domain proteins also play a central role. Kindlins directly bind integrin β subunit cytoplasmic domains at a site distinct from the talin-binding site, and target to focal adhesions in adherent cells. However, the mechanisms by which kindlins impact integrin activation remain largely unknown. A notable feature of kindlins is their similarity to the integrin-binding and activating talin FERM domain. Drawing on this similarity, here we report the identification of an unstructured insert in the kindlin F1 FERM domain, and provide evidence that a highly conserved polylysine motif in this loop supports binding to negatively charged phospholipid head groups. We further show that the F1 loop and its membrane-binding motif are required for kindlin-1 targeting to focal adhesions, and for the cooperation between kindlin-1 and -2 and the talin head in αIIbβ3 integrin activation, but not for kindlin binding to integrin β tails. These studies highlight the structural and functional similarities between kindlins and the talin head and indicate that as for talin, FERM domain interactions with acidic membrane phospholipids as well β-integrin tails contribute to the ability of kindlins to activate integrins.

https://openalex.org/W2020388502,"Objective The expression of FcγRIIIa/CD16 may render monocytes targets for activation by IgG-containing immune complexes (IC). We investigated whether FcγRIIIa/CD16 was upregulated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), associated with TNF production in response to IC-stimulation, and if this predicted response to methotrexate therapy. Methods FcγRIIIa/CD16 expression on CD14low and CD14++ monocytes was measured by flow cytometry in healthy controls and RA patients (early and long-standing disease). Intracellular TNF-staining was carried out after in vitro LPS or heat-aggregated immunoglobulin (HAG) activation. FcγRIIIa/CD16 expression pre- and post-steroid/methotrexate treatment was examined. Results Increased FcγRIIIa/CD16 expression on CD14++ monocytes in long-standing RA patients compared to controls was demonstrated (p = 0.002) with intermediate levels in early-RA patients. HAG-induced TNF-production in RA patients was correlated with the percentage of CD14++ monocytes expressing FcγRIIIa/CD16 (p<0.001). The percentage of CD14++ monocytes expressing FcγRIIIa/CD16 at baseline in early DMARD-naïve RA patients was negatively correlated with DAS28-ESR improvement 14-weeks post-methotrexate therapy (p = 0.003) and was significantly increased in EULAR non-responders compared to moderate (p = 0.01) or good responders (p = 0.003). FcγRIIIa/CD16 expression was not correlated with age, presence of systemic inflammation or autoantibody titers. Conclusion Increased FcγRIIIa/CD16 expression on CD14++ monocytes in RA may result in a cell that has increased responsiveness to IC-stimulation. This monocyte subset may contribute to non-response to methotrexate therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1969873234,"The lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) is located in the ventrolateral medulla and is known as a sympathoexcitatory area involved in the control of blood pressure. In recent experiments, we showed that the LPGi contains a large number of neurons activated during PS hypersomnia following a selective deprivation. Among these neurons, more than two-thirds are GABAergic and more than one fourth send efferent fibers to the wake-active locus coeruleus nucleus. To get more insight into the role of the LPGi in PS regulation, we combined an electrophysiological and anatomical approach in the rat, using extracellular recordings in the head-restrained model and injections of tracers followed by the immunohistochemical detection of Fos in control, PS-deprived and PS-recovery animals. With the head-restrained preparation, we showed that the LPGi contains neurons specifically active during PS (PS-On neurons), neurons inactive during PS (PS-Off neurons) and neurons indifferent to the sleep-waking cycle. After injection of CTb in the facial nucleus, the neurons of which are hyperpolarized during PS, the largest population of Fos/CTb neurons visualized in the medulla in the PS-recovery condition was observed in the LPGi. After injection of CTb in the LPGi itself and PS-recovery, the nucleus containing the highest number of Fos/CTb neurons, moreover bilaterally, was the sublaterodorsal nucleus (SLD). The SLD is known as the pontine executive PS area and triggers PS through glutamatergic neurons. We propose that, during PS, the LPGi is strongly excited by the SLD and hyperpolarizes the motoneurons of the facial nucleus in addition to local and locus coeruleus PS-Off neurons, and by this means contributes to PS genesis."

Proteins are often covalently trapped on DNA by DNA damaging agents, forming DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs). However, little is known about how immobilized proteins affect transcription. To elucidate the effect of DPCs on transcription, we constructed DNA templates containing site-specific DPCs and performed in vitro transcription reactions using phage T7 RNAP. We show here that DPCs constitute strong but not absolute blocks to in vitro transcription catalyzed by T7 RNAP. More importantly, sequence analysis of transcripts shows that RNAPs roadblocked not only by DPCs but also by the stalled leading RNAP become highly error prone and generate mutations in the upstream intact template regions. This contrasts with the transcriptional mutations induced by conventional DNA lesions, which are delivered to the active site or its proximal position in RNAPs and cause direct misincorporation. Our data also indicate that the trailing RNAP stimulates forward translocation of the stalled leading RNAP, promoting the translesion bypass of DPCs. The present results provide new insights into the transcriptional fidelity and mutual interactions of RNAPs that encounter persistent roadblocks.

https://openalex.org/W2152574220,"Flagellum motility is critical for normal human development and for transmission of pathogenic protozoa that cause tremendous human suffering worldwide. Biophysical principles underlying motility of eukaryotic flagella are conserved from protists to vertebrates. However, individual cells exhibit diverse waveforms that depend on cell-specific elaborations on basic flagellum architecture. Trypanosoma brucei is a uniflagellated protozoan parasite that causes African sleeping sickness. The T. brucei flagellum is comprised of a 9+2 axoneme and an extra-axonemal paraflagellar rod (PFR), but the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of the underlying structural units is poorly defined. Here, we use dual-axis electron tomography to determine the 3D architecture of the T. brucei flagellum. We define the T. brucei axonemal repeating unit. We observe direct connections between the PFR and axonemal dyneins, suggesting a mechanism by which mechanochemical signals may be transmitted from the PFR to axonemal dyneins. We find that the PFR itself is comprised of overlapping laths organized into distinct zones that are connected through twisting elements at the zonal interfaces. The overall structure has an underlying 57 nm repeating unit. Biomechanical properties inferred from PFR structure lead us to propose that the PFR functions as a biomechanical spring that may store and transmit energy derived from axonemal beating. These findings provide insight into the structural foundations that underlie the distinctive flagellar waveform that is a hallmark of T. brucei cell motility."
https://openalex.org/W2009025915,"NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2)-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)) microbicidal function. Nox2 also plays a role in intracellular signaling, but the site of oxidase assembly is unknown. It has been proposed to occur on secondary granules. We previously demonstrated that intracellular NADPH oxidase-derived ROS production is required for endotoxin priming. We hypothesized that endotoxin drives Nox2 assembly on endosomes. Endotoxin induced ROS generation within an endosomal compartment as quantified by flow cytometry (dihydrorhodamine 123 and Oxyburst Green). Inhibition of endocytosis by the dynamin-II inhibitor Dynasore blocked endocytosis of dextran, intracellular generation of ROS, and priming of PMN by endotoxin. Confocal microscopy demonstrated a ROS-containing endosomal compartment that co-labeled with gp91(phox), p40(phox), p67(phox), and Rab5, but not with the secondary granule marker CD66b. To further characterize this compartment, PMNs were fractionated by nitrogen cavitation and differential centrifugation, followed by free flow electrophoresis. Specific subfractions made superoxide in the presence of NADPH by cell-free assay (cytochrome c). Subfraction content of membrane and cytosolic subunits of Nox2 correlated with ROS production. Following priming, there was a shift in the light membrane subfractions where ROS production was highest. CD66b was not mobilized from the secondary granule compartment. These data demonstrate a novel, nonphagosomal intracellular site for Nox2 assembly. This compartment is endocytic in origin and is required for PMN priming by endotoxin."

Phosphorylation of the m-domain may modulate interactions of the C1-m-C2 region with the myosin S2 region and actin. cMyBP-C is extensively phosphorylated under basal conditions (22.Sadayappan S.

In vitro studies demonstrated that phosphorylated cMyBP-C displays a weakened interaction with the S2 region of myosin and that this state promotes myosin-actin interaction, activating cross-bridge cycling rates (9.Gruen M. Prinz H. Gautel M. cAPK-phosphorylation controls the interaction of the regulatory domain of cardiac myosin binding protein C with myosin-S2 in an on-off fashion.FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies support the idea that cMyBP-C modulates sarcomere assembly and stabilizes thick and thin filaments via its N-terminal region. However, little is known about the structural mechanisms by which the N-terminal region of cMyBP-C modulates cardiac contractility in different vertebrate species. A complete understanding of cMyBP-C arrangement in the sarcomere is essential in determining the roles that post-translational modification plays in modulating cMyBP-C interaction with myosin and/or actin. Two structural models are currently being discussed in the literature: the trimeric collar model and the rod model. The collar-like model proposes that three cMyBP-C molecules interact with each other at the C5–C10 domains and form a collar-like structure around the core of the thick filament (27.Flashman E. Korkie L. Watkins H. Redwood C. Moolman-Smook J.C. Support for a trimeric collar of myosin binding protein C in cardiac and fast skeletal muscle, but not in slow skeletal muscle.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The rod model proposes that the C-terminal region of cMyBP-C interacts along the axis of the thick filament with the N-terminal region, extending perpendicularly toward the thin filament (28.Squire J.M. Luther P.K. Knupp C. Structural evidence for the interaction of C-protein (MyBP-C) with actin and sequence identification of a possible actin-binding domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 713-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although there are conflicting data for each of the models, all invoke interaction with the thick and thin filament systems, suggesting the necessity of further studies on cMyBP-C to determine the structure and arrangement of the N-terminal region, its interaction partners, and the role of phosphorylation. Small angle x-ray scattering of the N-terminal region in combination with the NMR structures of the individual C0, C1, and C2 domains suggests an elongated rodlike particle of sufficient length to span the interfilament cross-bridge distance (29.Jeffries C.M. Whitten A.E. Harris S.P. Trewhella J. Small-angle x-ray scattering reveals the N-terminal domain organization of cardiac myosin binding protein C.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 1186-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics analyses and scattering data for C1-m-C2 suggest that the structure of the m-domain is compact and consistent with an immunoglobulin-like fold (29.Jeffries C.M. Whitten A.E. Harris S.P. Trewhella J. Small-angle x-ray scattering reveals the N-terminal domain organization of cardiac myosin binding protein C.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 1186-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These studies further show that interdomain interfaces between C0, C1, m-domain, and C2 have a degree of rigidity, whereas the Pro/Ala linker connecting the C0 and C1 domains provides structural flexibility at the extreme N terminus (30.Jeffries C.M. Lu Y. Hynson R.M. Taylor J.E. Ballesteros M. Kwan A.H. Trewhella J. Human cardiac myosin binding protein C: structural flexibility within an extended modular architecture.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 414: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, atomic force microscopic analysis predicts that the m-domain is likely to be disordered, increasing the flexibility between the C1 and C2 domains (31.Karsai A. Kellermayer M.S. Harris S.P. Mechanical unfolding of cardiac myosin binding protein-C by atomic force microscopy.Biophys. J. 2011; 101: 1968-1977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Small angle neutron scattering with contrast variation in the presence of actin demonstrated a specific interaction between the N-terminal region of cMyBP-C and actin (32.Whitten A.E. Jeffries C.M. Harris S.P. Trewhella J. Cardiac myosin-binding protein C decorates F-actin: implications for cardiac function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18360-18365Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The best fit model predicts that C0-C1 lie at the interface between two adjacent actin molecules with C0 lying close to the DNase I binding loop and C1 lying close to the actin filament near subdomain 1 (32.Whitten A.E. Jeffries C.M. Harris S.P. Trewhella J. Cardiac myosin-binding protein C decorates F-actin: implications for cardiac function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18360-18365Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this configuration, the m-domain and C2 project away from the actin filament partially as a consequence of steric hindrance. Taken together, the available structural data suggest that the N-terminal region of cMyBP-C interacts with both myosin and actin, providing a means for cMyBP-C to modulate thick and thin filament interactions. However, the molecular details of these interactions and the structural consequences of m-domain phosphorylation on the interactions of cMyBP-C with the thick and thin filaments remain unknown. In the present study, we utilized NMR to analyze the structure and dynamics of the m-domain in solution. Surprisingly, we found the N-terminal subdomain to be largely disordered and the C-terminal subdomain containing three helices to be capable of forming a three-helix bundle, potentially providing a platform for interactions with actin. DNA coding for amino acids 255–357 of mouse cMyBP-C (UniProt accession number 070468), representing the m-domain, was amplified by PCR using C0C2-coding DNA as a template. The forward and reverse cMyBP-C m-domain primers were 5′-ATGCCGCATATGCATGAGGCCATTGGTTCTGG-3′ and 5′-ATGCATGCGGCCGCTCACTTCTTTTCATCCTG-3′. The PCR product was then cloned into pET 28a(+) using the NdeI and NotI restriction enzymes and subsequently transformed in DH5α cells immediately following successful ligation. Plasmid minipreps were done, and the authenticity of the m-domain insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Uniform 13C/15N isotope-labeled protein representing the cMyBP-C m-domain was expressed following transformation into BL21(DE3) host cells (Novagen) using M9 medium supplemented with 1.0 g/liter 15NH4Cl and 2 g/liter [13C]glucose. Cells were grown to an A600 of 1.0 and induced with 0.1 mm final concentration of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for recombinant protein expression. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after 4 h of induction and stored at −80 °C until further use. Frozen cells were thawed, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, and subsequently lysed by sonication. Following centrifugation, the clarified supernatant was loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed, and the m-domain was eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of 5–300 mm imidazole. Fractions containing m-domain were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column. The m-domain eluted as a single peak and was determined to be homogenous by SDS gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Protein concentration was estimated by Bradford analysis. The purified m-domain was concentrated by ultrafiltration and exchanged into NMR buffer (20 mm Tris-d11, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 1 mm EDTA, 10% 2H2O) to a final concentration of ∼1 mm. Backbone and side-chain resonances for [13C,15N]cMyBP-C(255–357) were assigned using the following suite of NMR experiments: HNCαCβ, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, CβCα(CO)NH,HβHα(CO)NH, and C(CO)NH (Table 1). 15N-TOCSY (50-ms mixing time), 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (100-ms mixing times), and 15N-edited HSQC-NOESY-HSQC (100-, 150-, and 200-ms mixing times) were also used (Table 1). 15N{1H}NOE values were collected at 800 MHz as described previously (33.Gaponenko V. Abusamhadneh E. Abbott M.B. Finley N. Gasmi-Seabrook G. Solaro R.J. Rance M. Rosevear P.R.

Chemical shift assignments for the m-domain were deposited in the BioMagResBank the under the accession number 17867. The secondary structure of the m-domain was predicted using chemical shift index (CSI) analysis, which was generated using 1Hα, 13Cα,13Cβ, and 13C′ chemical shifts. Dihedral angle restraints were calculated from 1Hα, 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C′, and 15N chemical shifts with the program TALOS+ (34.Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. Protein backbone angle restraints from searching a database for chemical shift and sequence homology.J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure for the C-terminal portion of the m-domain was calculated with CS-Rosetta using the complete 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C′, 15N, 1Hα, and 1HN chemical shifts of those residues determined by TALOS+ to have an S2 value >0.7. A set of 200 fragment candidates matching these chemical shifts was used to calculate 5000 structures in Rosetta. The energy of these Rosetta structures was then rescored against the observed chemical shifts, and the 20 lowest rescored energy structures were selected for the ensemble. This produced an ensemble of 20 structures with a Cα root mean square deviation of 1.3 ± 0.4 against the lowest energy structure. The structure ensemble representing the C-terminal portion of the m-domain was deposited in the Protein Data Bank the under the accession number 2LHU.TABLE 1NMR parameters for resonance assignment and secondary structure determination of m-domain from cMyBP-CExperimentntsw1sw2sw3np1np2np3FieldHNCO812,0193,7702,4301,0248032800HN(CA)CO3212,0193,7702,4301,0246432800HNCACB1612,01916,0792,4301,0248032800CBCA(CO)NH1612,01916,0792,4301,0248032800HBHA(CO)NH3212,0196,0102,4301,0246032800C(CO)NNH1612,01916,0792,4301,0248032800noesyNhsqc328,3818,3851,8301,0248028600tocsyNhsqc328,3858,3851,8301,0248028600NhsqcNOESYNhsqc56/968,3851,8301,8301,02448/3428600gNhsqc3212,0192,4301,024128800gNOE16012,0192,4301,024128800 Open table in a new tab We have cloned, expressed, and purified the m-domain, corresponding to residues 255–357 (human 257–361), of mouse cMyBP-C in an effort to probe the structure, dynamics, and consequences of phosphorylation on the N terminus of this multidomain protein. A 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the m-domain was used to visualize the purity of the protein before initiating structural studies (Fig. 1). The CD spectrum of the m-domain was consistent with a protein having a high content of undefined structural elements. Fitting the experimental data using the CDSSTR method gave 33% helix, 16% strand, 20% turns, and 31% unordered structure (35.Whitmore L.

Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar). Consistent with the high percentage of unordered structure, the melting curve for the m-domain is gradual and noncooperative when ellipticity at 220 nm was monitored as a function of temperature. This suggested that a portion of the m-domain is disordered or flexible in solution without a compact hydrophobic core. To further explore the structure and stability of the m-domain, isotope-labeled [13C, 15N]m-domain was prepared for analysis by heteronuclear multidimensional NMR. Backbone and side-chain NMR resonances were assigned for all 104 residues using standard triple resonance assignment strategies. Consistent with CD spectra, dispersion in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was significantly lower than that observed for a well structured protein (Fig. 2). To evaluate the dynamic properties of the m-domain, 15N{1H}NOE values at 800 MHz were collected. The 15N{1H}NOE data suggest that the protein can be divided into two regions, a well folded C-terminal portion having an average 15N{1H}NOE value of 0.78 and an N-terminal portion having 15N{1H}NOE values less then 0.6, suggesting a much more flexible structure (Fig. 3). Residues 309–314 appear to form a short linker between the less ordered N-terminal portion and the structured C-terminal portion (Fig. 3).FIGURE 31H-15N heteronuclear NOE values (15N{1H}NOE) for [13C,15N]m-domain are plotted versus residue number of m-domain in cMyBP-C. Data were collected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The error bars represent the standard deviation of the heteronuclear NOE ratio.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Backbone and 13Cβ chemical shifts were used to evaluate m-domain secondary structure. Secondary chemical shifts, deviations in the observed chemical shifts from their random coil values, can be used to calculate the CSI, an accurate predictor of fully formed α- and β-structure (37.Wishart D.S.

Chemical shifts as a tool for structure determination.Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Backbone chemical shifts for the Cβ, Cα, C′, and Hα resonances were used to determine CSI values for each m-domain residue (Table 2). The consensus CSI predicted five potential helical regions in the m-domain. Residues showing helical propensities were 265–268, 293–295, 314–322, 329–336, and 340–348 (Table 2). No regions of β-structure were detected. Backbone chemical shifts were also analyzed using a residue-specific secondary structure propensity (SSP) score (39.Marsh J.A. Singh V.K. Jia Z. Forman-Kay J.D. Sensitivity of secondary structure propensities to sequence differences between α- and γ-synuclein: implications for fibrillation.Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2795-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). This approach has been highly successful in comparing secondary structure propensities in both intrinsically disordered and folded proteins. Residue-specific SSP scores of 1 or −1 reflect fully formed α- and β-structure, respectively. Scores between 0 and 1 are representative of the fraction of α-structure, whereas scores between 0 and −1 are representative of the fraction of β-structure. Thus, SSP scores qualitatively correspond to the secondary structural propensity at that residue. The SSP scores calculated for m-domain residues are shown in Fig. 4. Five regions with varying secondary structural propensities were identified. Residues 263–267 for helix 1 and residues 292–298 for helix 2 were found to have average structural propensities of 27 and 36%, respectively (Table 2). Lower structural propensities for these helices correspond to reduced 15N{1H}NOE values observed for t"

Previous studies have suggested that Hsp47 may preferentially recognize the triple-helix form of procollagen rather than unfolded procollagen chains in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the underlying mechanism has remained unclear because of limitations in the available methods for detecting in vitro and in vivo interactions between Hsp47 and collagen. In this study, we established novel methods for this purpose by adopting a time-resolved FRET technique in vitro and a bimolecular fluorescence complementation technique in vivo. Using these methods, we provide direct evidence that Hsp47 binds to collagen triple helices but not to the monomer form in vitro. We also demonstrate that Hsp47 binds a collagen model peptide in the trimer conformation in vivo. Hsp47 did not bind collagen peptides that had been modified to block their ability to form triple helices in vivo.

IntroductionCollagen is the most abundant protein in mammals and, as a major component of the extracellular matrix, plays a pivotal role in tissue architecture and robustness and in cell-cell interactions. Individual collagen polypeptide chains contain large numbers of repetitive amino acid sequences, most often Gly-Xaa-Yaa, where Xaa is often Pro and Yaa is often 4-hydroxy-l-proline, the latter amino acid being produced by hydroxylation of Pro following collagen polypeptide synthesis. All types of collagen have a characteristic triple-helical structure. The presence of Gly at every third residue and the high imino acid content allow the formation of a triple-helical structure in which the three helical chains are staggered by one residue and are supercoiled in a right-handed manner. Appropriate folding of collagen into its triple helix followed by processing of N- and C-propeptides is critical for the formation of the extracellular matrix. Because the extracellular matrix is required for the formation of bones and other tissues, collagen folding defects lead to severe bone fragility and deformities such as osteogenesis imperfecta (1.Prockop D.J.

These results indicate that Hsp47 is essential for the maturation of collagen.To elucidate the mechanism of client recognition by Hsp47, in vitro binding analysis using a synthetic collagen model peptide has been used to identify a specific Hsp47-binding sequence in collagen; Arg residues at the Yaa position of the collagen Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats are a critical minimum for Hsp47 binding (17.Koide T.

However, because of a lack of direct mechanistic studies of the interaction between Hsp47 and procollagen, it remains controversial as to whether Hsp47 recognizes only the triple-helix conformation or whether it also recognizes the single-chain polypeptide.In this study, we provide direct observational evidence that Hsp47 interacts with triple-helix collagen but not with its monomer. This result was achieved using self-assembling homotrimeric collagen model peptides, separated by gel filtration chromatography, in a novel binding assay based on a time-resolved (TR) FRET technique. We also developed a versatile visualization system for detecting the interaction between Hsp47 and a collagen model peptide fused to foldon, which is derived from the C-terminal domain of T4 fibritin and is known to facilitate trimer conformation (21.Frank S.

This technique provides a tremendous advantage over existing techniques to measure protein-protein interactions, including immunoprecipitation, surface plasmon resonance, and pulldown techniques (27.Nakai A.

For example, indirect interaction via other proteins cannot be excluded using immunoprecipitation or pulldown techniques, and steric effects can potentially interfere with analysis by surface plasmon resonance. Additional advantages of our new technique include the shorter overall incubation time, greater throughput capacity, stability of the readout signal, and ease of automation for high-throughput screening. Recently, Okano-Kosugi et al. (32.Okano-Kosugi H. Matsushita O. Asada S. Herr A.B. Kitagawa K. Koide T. Development of a high-throughput screening system for the compounds that inhibit collagen-protein interactions.Anal. Biochem. 2009; 394: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) reported a turbidimetric assay to screen inhibitors of collagen-binding proteins, including Hsp47. The assay is based on changes in absorbance at 313 nm due to collagen fibril formation in vitro. However, this interesting method is not suitable for drug screening because of the large number of compounds with absorption close to 313 nm, which could cause false positive or negative signals. Meanwhile, the TR-FRET technique that we have employed in this assay may be an effective tool for drug screening due to the large Stokes shift of the assay and the long lifetime of the emitted light.Several lines of circumstantial evidence suggest that Hsp47 recognizes triple helices of collagen preferentially rather than unfolded collagen chains in the ER (18.Tasab M. Jenkinson L. Bulleid N.J. Sequence-specific recognition of collagen triple helices by the collagen-specific molecular chaperone HSP47.J. Biol.

Using a novel TR-FRET assay, we have now conclusively demonstrated in vitro that Hsp47 can interact with the trimer form of a collagen model peptide containing GPP triplets and GPTGPR, although it cannot interact with the monomer form (Fig. 2). Collagen model peptides with GPP triplet repeats form a triple helix at 25 °C when the number of repeats is greater than nine, which was judged by CD spectroscopic analysis (30.Koide T. Nishikawa Y.

Chem. 2010; 18: 3767-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and our results therefore strongly suggest that Hsp47 binds to the triple-helix form of collagen.The trimer fraction of the collagen model peptide was converted to the monomer form by heat treatment at 37 °C (Fig. 3B) but reverted to the trimer form after cooling at 4 °C (Fig. 3F). By referring to supplemental Fig. 2A, the transition from trimer to monomer did not occur during gel filtration. Interestingly, the monomer form separated by GFC did not revert to the trimer after cooling at 4 °C (supplemental Fig. 5F). The data presented in supplemental Fig. 3 suggest that the formation of the triple helix is concentration-dependent. The concentration of the monomer fraction separated by GFC was 4.9 μm, which was substantially higher than the concentration of 1 μm at which trimer formation can take place (supplemental Fig. 3A). Some unidentified difference might cause such a difference in the triple-helix formation.We also successfully developed a novel visualization system for detecting the interaction of Hsp47 with collagen model peptides within the ER of mammalian cells using a BiFC technique (24.Kerppola T.K. Visualization of molecular interactions by fluorescence complementation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) based on the reconstitution of two split fragments of the fluorescent protein mKG (25.Ueyama T. Kusakabe T. Karasawa S. Kawasaki T. Shimizu A. Son J. Leto T.L. Miyawaki A. Saito N. Sequential binding of cytosolic Phox complex to phagosomes through regulated adaptor proteins: evaluation using the novel monomeric Kusabira-Green system and live imaging of phagocytosis.J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We first attempted to detect the interaction of Hsp47 with the collagen model peptide fused to the C terminus of mKG together with the ER signal sequence. However, no significant interaction was detected (Fig. 5B, lower row). Detection of the interacting signals was dramatically improved by incorporating the foldon sequence into the collagen model peptide, suggesting that collagen model peptides do not form trimers without foldon and that Hsp47 cannot interact with non-trimeric model peptides within the cells. Collagen model peptides without foldon may be unable to form trimers because of conformational restrictions or poor prolyl hydroxylation by prolyl 4-hydroxylase due to the fusion with mKG or to decreased triple-helix formation at the incubation temperature of 37 °C, as described above. Du et al. (31.Du C. Wang M. Liu J. Pan M. Cai Y. Yao J. Improvement of thermostability of recombinant collagen-like protein by incorporating a foldon sequence.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 79: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported that the thermostability of recombinant collagen-like proteins was significantly improved when fused with the foldon sequence. Thus, the promotion of trimer formation in the collagen model peptides by foldon was necessary for the interaction with Hsp47 in this in vivo visualization system.No significant interaction was detected after the cotransfection of Hsp47 with (i) the PPG×3 peptide, which has only three Pro-Pro-Gly triplet repeats (Fig. 6A and supplemental Fig. 6A); (ii) the PPG×5 peptide, which has five Pro-Pro-Gly triplet repeats (data not shown); and (iii) the CP2GA×9 peptide, in which all of the Gly residues in CP2×9 were replaced by Ala (Fig. 6A and supplemental Fig. 6A). These results are attributed to the failure to form triple helices because of the small number of the triplet repeats (i and ii) or steric hindrance due to the substitution of Gly with Ala at the innermost position of the triple-helical structure (iii). Notably, the data using PPG×3 and PPG×5 peptides correlate well with previous work by Koide et al. (29.Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. Substrate recognition of collagen-specific molecular chaperone HSP47. Structural requirements and binding regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), in which Hsp47 did not interact with collagen model peptides containing fewer than six GPP triplet repeats. From these results, we conclude that the novel visualization system described here provides an efficient and specific methodology for detecting interactions between collagen-binding proteins and collagen model peptides within the ER of mammalian cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the real-time interaction of Hsp47 with collagen model peptides in living cells.In summary, we have conclusively demonstrated that Hsp47 recognizes and binds the triple-helix form (but not the monomer form) of collagen model peptides in vitro and in vivo using two newly developed methods. These findings suggest an important role for Hsp47 as a collagen-specific molecular chaperone in stabilizing the triple helices of procollagen in the ER. Our newly developed in vitro and in vivo analysis systems may also provide useful tools for screening small molecule inhibitors of the interaction between Hsp47 and collagen. IntroductionCollagen is the most abundant protein in mammals and, as a major component of the extracellular matrix, plays a pivotal role in tissue architecture and robustness and in cell-cell interactions. Individual collagen polypeptide chains contain large numbers of repetitive amino acid sequences, most often Gly-Xaa-Yaa, where Xaa is often Pro and Yaa is often 4-hydroxy-l-proline, the latter amino acid being produced by hydroxylation of Pro following collagen polypeptide synthesis. All types of collagen have a characteristic triple-helical structure. The presence of Gly at every third residue and the high imino acid content allow the formation of a triple-helical structure in which the three helical chains are staggered by one residue and are supercoiled in a right-handed manner. Appropriate folding of collagen into its triple helix followed by processing of N- and C-propeptides is critical for the formation of the extracellular matrix. Because the extracellular matrix is required for the formation of bones and other tissues, collagen folding defects lead to severe bone fragility and deformities such as osteogenesis imperfecta (1.Prockop D.J.

https://openalex.org/W2082818785,"Quantile-dependent penetrance is proposed to occur when the phenotypic expression of a SNP depends upon the population percentile of the phenotype. To illustrate the phenomenon, quantiles of height, body mass index (BMI), and plasma lipids and lipoproteins were compared to genetic risk scores (GRS) derived from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s having established genome-wide significance: 180 SNPs for height, 32 for BMI, 37 for low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, 47 for high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, 52 for total cholesterol, and 31 for triglycerides in 1930 subjects. Both phenotypes and GRSs were adjusted for sex, age, study, and smoking status. Quantile regression showed that the slope of the genotype-phenotype relationships increased with the percentile of BMI (P = 0.002), LDL-cholesterol (P = 3×10−8), HDL-cholesterol (P = 5×10−6), total cholesterol (P = 2.5×10−6), and triglyceride distribution (P = 7.5×10−6), but not height (P = 0.09). Compared to a GRS's phenotypic effect at the 10th population percentile, its effect at the 90th percentile was 4.2-fold greater for BMI, 4.9-fold greater for LDL-cholesterol, 1.9-fold greater for HDL-cholesterol, 3.1-fold greater for total cholesterol, and 3.3-fold greater for triglycerides. Moreover, the effect of the rs1558902 (FTO) risk allele was 6.7-fold greater at the 90th than the 10th percentile of the BMI distribution, and that of the rs3764261 (CETP) risk allele was 2.4-fold greater at the 90th than the 10th percentile of the HDL-cholesterol distribution. Conceptually, it maybe useful to distinguish environmental effects on the phenotype that in turn alters a gene's phenotypic expression (quantile-dependent penetrance) from environmental effects affecting the gene's phenotypic expression directly (gene-environment interaction)."

We investigated the rapid change in polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) numbers in response to PGF2α administration as the first cells recruited to inflammatory sites, together with mRNA of interleukin-8 (IL-8: neutrophil chemoattractant) and P-selectin (leukocyte adhesion molecule) in the bovine CL. CLs were collected by ovariectomy at various times after PGF2α injection. The number of PMNs was increased at 5 min after PGF2α administration, whereas IL-8 and P-selectin mRNA increased at 30 min and 2 h, respectively. PGF2α directly stimulated P-selectin protein expression at 5–30 min in luteal endothelial cells (LECs). Moreover, PGF2α enhanced PMN adhesion to LECs, and this enhancement by PGF2α was inhibited by anti-P-selectin antibody, suggesting that P-selectin expression by PGF2α is crucial in PMN migration. In conclusion, PGF2α rapidly induces the accumulation of PMNs into the bovine CL at 5 min and enhances PMN adhesion via P-selectin expression in LECs. It is suggested that luteolytic cascade by PGF2α may involve an acute inflammatory-like response due to rapidly infiltrated PMNs."
https://openalex.org/W2010310550,"Abnormal phosphorylation and aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau are hallmarks of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease. Molecular mechanisms that regulate Tau phosphorylation are complex and currently incompletely understood. We have developed a novel live cell reporter system based on protein-fragment complementation assay to study dynamic changes in Tau phosphorylation status. In this assay, fusion proteins of Tau and Pin1 (peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase 1) carrying complementary fragments of a luciferase protein serve as a sensor of altered protein-protein interaction between Tau and Pin1, a critical regulator of Tau dephosphorylation at several disease-associated proline-directed phosphorylation sites. Using this system, we identified several structurally distinct GABA(A) receptor modulators as novel regulators of Tau phosphorylation in a chemical library screen. GABA(A) receptor activation promoted specific phosphorylation of Tau at the AT8 epitope (Ser-199/Ser-202/Thr-205) in cultures of mature cortical neurons. Increased Tau phosphorylation by GABA(A) receptor activity was associated with reduced Tau binding to protein phosphatase 2A and was dependent on Cdk5 but not GSK3β kinase activity."

The GAG 2The abbreviations used are:GAGglycosaminoglycan6N3-GlcNAc6-deoxy, 6-azido-N-acetylglucosaminePmCSP. multocida chondroitin synthaseHAhyaluronanPmHASP. multocida hyaluronan synthasePmHSP. multocida heparosan synthaseHexNhexosamineGlcN-TFAN-trifluoroacetyl-glucosamine.synthases that are responsible for forming the polysaccharide capsule of different serotypes of the pathogenic bacteria Pasteurella multocida have been identified. The enzymes PmHAS (Carter Type A), PmCS (Type F), and PmHS1 (Type D) are responsible for forming hyaluronan, chondroitin, or heparosan capsule, respectively (1.DeAngelis P.L. Microbial glycosaminoglycan glycosyltransferases.Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 9R-16RCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). PmHS2, which synthesizes heparosan in vitro, is also found in multiple serotypes of Pasteurella (Types A, D, and F) and has been hypothesized to be responsible for capsule switching (2.Deangelis P.L.

In all cases identified thus far, the disaccharide repeats that constitute these GAGs are synthesized by glycosyltransferases, which use UDP-sugar nucleotide donor molecules according to the reactionn UDP−GIcUA+n UDP−HexNAc→2n UDP+(GIcUA−HexNAc)n glycosaminoglycan 6-deoxy, 6-azido-N-acetylglucosamine P. multocida chondroitin synthase hyaluronan P. multocida hyaluronan synthase P. multocida heparosan synthase hexosamine N-trifluoroacetyl-glucosamine. where HexNAc = N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) or N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc). Each of the GAGs generated by these synthases are identical or similar to the GAGs found in vertebrates and are postulated to act as a form of “molecular camouflage” for enhancing infection of Pasteurella (1.DeAngelis P.L. Microbial glycosaminoglycan glycosyltransferases.Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 9R-16RCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, anti-capsule antibodies are effective host weapons, but GAGs are a difficult target to defend against due to their “self” nature. The Pasteurella heparosan synthases are bifunctional glycosyltransferases that consist of two domains that have significant similarity to the Escherichia coli K5 monofunctional glycosyltransferases, KfiA and KfiC, which together are responsible for generating the heparosan (N-acetylheparosan or the unmodified heparin backbone) capsule of E. coli K5 (3.Hodson N.

KfiC is a CAZy (Carbohydrate Active enZymes database) GT2 family GlcUA-transferase, whereas KfiA is a GT45 family GlcNAc-transferase. PmHAS and PmCS are also bifunctional glycosyltransferases, each consisting of two CAZy GT2 family domains (containing 22,514 predicted and 255 characterized members as of 2011) (5.DeAngelis P.L. Evolution of glycosaminoglycans and their glycosyltransferases: implications for the extracellular matrices of animals and the capsules of pathogenic bacteria.Anat. Rec. 2002; 268: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Each of these synthases have similarity to the E. coli K4 chondroitin polymerase for which there is a crystal structure available (6.Osawa T. Sugiura N. Shimada H. Hirooka R. Tsuji A. Shirakawa T.

Commun. 2009; 378: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The structure and activity of the Pasteurella heparosan synthases are less well studied. There are only five biochemically characterized members with the GT45 family GlcNAc-transferase component (containing 15 total members) found in their domains. The GlcUA-transferase domain, located at the N terminus of the PmHS synthases, is a GT2 family member. The corresponding, but rather dissimilar (∼30% protein sequence identity), functional domains of both PmHAS and PmCS reside at the C terminus. In lieu of specific three-dimensional structural information for PmHS1 or PmHS2, we explored the possibility of threading the Pasteurella heparosan synthase sequences onto existing protein structures, but appropriate candidates with suitable sequence similarity are not apparent. Our attempts to dissect the bifunctional heparosan synthases into two polypeptides each with an active glycosyltransferase component (i.e. either GT2 or GT45) by molecular genetic means or partial proteolysis were unsuccessful; therefore, our annotation of the boundaries of the domains are approximate. The high degree of sequence identity between PmHS1 and PmHS2 (supplemental Fig. 1), along with their distinct catalytic abilities to initiate polysaccharide chains and utilize unnatural UDP-sugar analogs (7.Sismey-Ragatz A.E. Green D.E. Otto N.J. Rejzek M. Field R.A. DeAngelis P.L. Chemoenzymatic synthesis with distinct Pasteurella heparosan synthases: monodisperse polymers and unnatural structures.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), affords a unique opportunity to study the structure/function relationship of these synthases. Each of the PmHS1 and PmHS2 glycosyltransferases possess a desirable catalytic property or “phenotype” that the other enzyme lacks (7.Sismey-Ragatz A.E. Green D.E. Otto N.J. Rejzek M. Field R.A.

In addition to the structure/function insights gained in this work, our chimeric polypeptide approach to studying these enzymes has also enabled us to generate mutant enzymes possessing multiple desirable traits for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of GAGs. We present here the generation of novel catalysts that are able to transfer two useful UDP-sugar analogs, as well as possessing enhanced transferase activity and the ability to generate longer, more monodisperse polysaccharides containing these sugar analogs. As a demonstration, we have also synthesized polysaccharides containing both natural and analog sugar “blocks” with potential utility for producing mimics of heparan sulfate/heparin polysaccharides. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher Scientific unless otherwise noted. Custom synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Various HA molecular weight standards were obtained from Hyalose, LLC (Oklahoma City, OK) (8.Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Synchronized chemoenzymatic synthesis of monodisperse hyaluronan polymers.J. Biol.

PCR products resulting from the gene splicing reactions (supplemental Fig. 2) were cloned into the pMAL-c4e vector (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) according to manufacturer's instructions and transformed into E. coli TOP-10F′ cells with selection on LB/ampicillin plates at 30 °C. The plasmids of transformants were screened by restriction digest, and those with the correct insert were confirmed by DNA sequencing of both strands (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation sequencing facility). Plasmids were then transformed into the production host, phage lysin-expressing freeze/thaw lysis E. coli XJa cells (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). For protein production, cultures of recombinant E. coli XJa in Superior Broth (AthenaES, Baltimore, MD) with ampicillin (50 μg/ml), carbenicillin (50 μg/ml), and l-arabinose (3.25 mm final; to induce the lysin enzyme) were grown at 30 °C. Expression of target protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (0.2 mm final) when the culture A600 reached 0.35. At 1 h after induction, growth was supplemented with fructose (12.8 mm final), and growth proceeded for ∼16 h before cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g, 30 min at 4 °C). The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, with protease inhibitors p-(4-2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, benzamidine, N-(N-(l-3-trans-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl)-l-leucyl)-agmatine, and leupeptin on ice and subjected to two freeze/thaw cycles to allow the phage lysin to degrade the cell walls. The lysates were then clarified by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 30 min at 4 °C). Protein content was measured by the Bradford assay with a BSA standard (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The maltose-binding protein-tagged chimeric proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized amylose beads according to the manufacturer's guidelines (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). After ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra 10 kDa, Millipore, Billerica, MA) and buffer exchange into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, the purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by staining with Coomassie Blue dye or by Western blotting with detection using an anti-PmHS primary antibody that recognizes a common PmHS1/PmHS2 sequence (2.Deangelis P.L.

UDP-N-trifluoroacetyl-glucosamine (UDP-GlcN-TFA) was synthesized using chemoenzymatic methods as described (10.Liu R. Xu Y. Chen M. Weïwer M. Zhou X. Bridges A.S. DeAngelis P.L. Zhang Q. Linhardt R.J. Liu J. Chemoenzymatic design of heparan sulfate oligosaccharides.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 34240-34249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The synthesis of UDP-6-deoxy, 6-azido-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-6N3-GlcNAc), began with a selective tosylation at the C-6 position of GlcNAc α-benzyl glycoside (11.Yeager A.R. Finney N.S. Synthesis of fluorescently labeled UDP-GlcNAc analogues and their evaluation as chitin synthase substrates.J. Org. Chem. 2005; 70: 1269-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Acetylation followed by hydrogenolysis generated the free anomeric hydroxyl, which was phosphorylated using phosphoramidite chemistry. Removal of all protecting groups gave 6-tosyl-α-GlcNAc 1-phosphate, and treatment with sodium azide in N,N-dimethylformamide introduced the 6-azido functionality. A final coupling with UMP-morpholidate gave the product UDP-6-deoxy, 6-azido-N-acetylglucosamine, which was stored as the disodium salt. Radiolabeled sugar incorporation assays (25-μl reactions, 30 °C for the times noted) were performed using purified enzymes (2–12 μg of protein, as noted) in the presence of 10 mm UDP-GlcUA with radioactive precursor (UDP-[3H]GlcUA, 0.2 μCi per assay, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and various amounts as noted of UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GlcN-TFA, or UDP-6N3-GlcNAc. An assay with no second hexosamine precursor was used as a negative control. The reaction buffer was 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm MnCl2. As noted, extensively sonicated Type D P. multocida-derived heparosan (sonicated 60 min on ice to increase the number of termini; average size ∼30 kDa) was used as an acceptor. Reactions were incubated at the indicated temperatures for the times noted and then stopped with 2% final SDS and separated by descending paper chromatography (overnight in 65:35 ethanol/1 m ammonium acetate buffer, Whatman 3MM paper). This method enables the separation of GAG polysaccharides with greater than ∼14 sugar units, which remain at the origin, from smaller oligomers and unincorporated nucleotide sugars that migrate down the strip. The origin of the strip was cut out and subjected to liquid scintillation counting (Biosafe, RPI Corp., Mount Prospect, IL). Single sugar incorporation assays were performed using 2 mm heparosan tetrasaccharide as an acceptor (GlcUA-GlcNAc-GlcUA-anhydromannitol; prepared as in Ref. 12.Chen M. Bridges A. Liu J. Determination of the substrate specificities of N-acetyl-d-glucosaminyltransferase.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12358-12365Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Donor nucleotide sugars (UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-6N3-GlcNAc, or UDP-GlcN-TFA) were used at 10 mm. Reactions were performed in the presence of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 0.2 μg/μl of the enzyme noted for 16 h at 30 °C. Reaction products were assessed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry (reflector negative mode using an Ultraflex II instrument, Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA), with the matrix 6-aza-2-thiothymine at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). HA oligosaccharides were employed as mass calibrants (Hyalose, LLC, Oklahoma City, OK). Spectra were analyzed using flexAnalysis version 2.4 (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). Polysaccharides containing alternating blocks of GlcNAc- and GlcN-TFA-based repeats were synthesized by a series of successive addition reactions. Reactions contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm MnCl2 buffer. Each stage was incubated at 30 °C for 16 h. The first reaction had 400 μm heparosan tetrasaccharide (GlcUA-GlcNAc-GlcUA-anhydromannitol) as an acceptor. All reactions received 10 mm UDP-GlcUA and, depending on the desired block, either 10 mm UDP-GlcNAc or 10 mm UDP-GlcN-TFA. Each reaction received 0.5 μg/μl Chimera G enzyme. After each step, polysaccharide products were purified from the unincorporated UDP-sugars and UDP using ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra 3 kDa, three times with 500-μl water rinses). These polysaccharide intermediates were then used as acceptor (as noted) in reactions where the hexosamine donors were alternated (e.g. after GlcNAc was added in first block, UDP-GlcN-TFA was then employed) as indicated to produce bipartite or tripartite polysaccharide products. We were able to generate unique GAG pentasaccharides by extending tetrasaccharides using unnatural UDP-sugar analog donor molecules (Fig. 1). PmHS1 was able to utilize the donor molecule UDP-6N3-GlcNAc to add 6N3-GlcNAc to GlcUA-terminated heparosan tetrasaccharides. PmHS2 could transfer GlcN-TFA from the donor UDP-GlcN-TFA to the same heparosan tetrasaccharides. In contrast, PmHS1 incorporates the GlcN-TFA analog very poorly, whereas PmHS2 is unable to use the 6N3-GlcNAc analog (as shown later). Chimera G is able to transfer both GlcN-TFA and 6N3-GlcNAc as well as the natural hexosamine sugar. These unnatural sugar analogs have functional chemical groups, making them useful for a wide range of applications ranging from biomaterials to therapeutics (Fig. 2). Demonstrations of the utility of analog functionalities in novel heparosan oligosaccharides are shown in supplemental Figs. 3 and 4. For the TFA analog-containing oligosaccharide, the protecting group was removed to expose the free amine (while preserving other existing acetyl groups), which was subsequently reacted with an isothiocyanate dye (supplemental Fig. 3). For the azide analog-containing oligosaccharide, a biotin click reagent was installed (supplemental Fig. 4).FIGURE 2Utility of unnatural UDP-sugar donors for synthesis of novel polysaccharides. GAGs with new functional chemical groups may be prepared by chemoenzymatic synthesis with the appropriate precursors and catalysts. PmHS1 is able to use the analog donor UDP-6N3-GlcNAc, but uses UDP-GlcN-TFA poorly. PmHS2 is able to use UDP-GlcN-TFA, but is not able to use UDP-6N3-GlcNAc. Another level of N-sulfation control is possible using Chimera G and UDP-GlcN-TFA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The specific activity of the wild-type PmHS2 synthase for polymerization of heparosan in the presence of an exogenous acceptor is ∼50–100-fold lower than that of PmHS1 (Fig. 3). It is of interest to determine which regions of these synthases account for this difference. Previous work has indicated that both the PmHS1 and PmHS2 GlcUA-transferase components operate at a higher rate than their GlcNAc-transferase counterparts (13.Chavaroche A.A. van den Broek L.A. Springer J. Boeriu C. Eggink G. Analysis of the polymerization initiation and activity of Pasteurella multocida heparosan synthase PmHS2, an enzyme with glycosyltransferase and UDP-sugar hydrolase activity.J. Biol.

Functional characterization of PmHS1, a Pasteurella multocida heparosan synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33192-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Of the chimeras that are active, enzymes containing portions of the PmHS1 GlcUA-transferase domain (PmHS11–318) exhibit markedly higher rates of polymerization than those with portions of the PmHS2 GlcUA-transferase, although none of the chimeric enzymes achieved the rate of polymerization of wild-type PmHS1. Three of the 10 chimeric enzymes failed to have detectable activity (Chimeras C, F, and H); this observation may be due to stability issues for those constructs or the loss of important residues or structures required for function. Notably, two of the inactive chimeras contained the same splice site at the C-terminal of the protein where the amino acid sequence of PmHS1 switches to PmHS2 (Chimeras C and H). The minimal oligosaccharide required for binding as an efficient acceptor for PmHS1 is not well characterized, but PmHAS employs hyaluronan trisaccharide and tetrasaccharide acceptors rather efficiently (15.Williams K.J. Halkes K.M. Kamerling J.P. DeAngelis P.L. Critical elements of oligosaccharide acceptor substrates for the Pasteurella multocida hyaluronan synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5391-5397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, it is clear that heparosan tetrasaccharide acceptors increase the overall rate of PmHS1-catalyzed polymer formation. This acceptor-stimulating effect on PmHAS and PmHS1 is postulated to be due to bypassing the relatively slow initiation phase of synthesis (coupling the first monosaccharide to a UDP-sugar) and allowing the much more rapid elongation phase to proceed. The initial polymerization rate of PmHS1 in the presence of exogenous acceptor is ∼350-fold higher than in reactions without acceptor. PmHS2 activity is also boosted by the presence of acceptor, but to a much lower extent (∼4-fold). Previous work using electrophoretic gel analysis of in vitro polymerization reactions has shown that, in the presence of acceptor, PmHS1 appears to prefer to elongate existing polysaccharide chains rather than start new chains (7.Sismey-Ragatz A.E. Green D.E. Otto N.J. Rejzek M. Field R.A. DeAngelis P.L. Chemoenzymatic synthesis with distinct Pasteurella heparosan synthases: monodisperse polymers and unnatural structures.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This circumstance allows synchronization of polymerization resulting in the production of heparosan with a narrow size distribution (quasi-monodisperse) due to virtually simultaneous extension. Conversely, PmHS2 is better at initiating synthesis of new polysaccharide chains, so the resulting heparosan is much more polydisperse and potentially of lower size (i.e. chains are not extensively elongated) (7.Sismey-Ragatz A.E. Green D.E. Otto N.J. Rejzek M. Field R.A. DeAngelis P.L. Chemoenzymatic synthesis with distinct Pasteurella heparosan synthases: monodisperse polymers and unnatural structures.J. Biol.

Chem. 2011; 286: 1777-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The ability to control the size distribution of the polysaccharide product through synchronized reactions is a desirable property; therefore, it is of interest to determine which portions of PmHS1 and PmHS2 are responsible for their differential abilities to initiate de novo synthesis of heparosan. Work is in progress to address this question, but based on our chimeric enzyme study (Fig. 3), we predict that residues in the heparosan synthases GlcUA-transferase domain acceptor binding site play a role in promoting new chain initiation by promoting binding of UDP-GlcNAc as an acceptor as in Ref. 13.Chavaroche A.A. van den Broek L.A.

Unnatural UDP-sugar donor molecules have the promise of generating GAG structures with utility for orthogonal chemistry. UDP-6N3-GlcNAc is the source of an azide group known to be useful for efficient click chemistry. UDP-GlcN-TFA is the source of a hexosamine that may be deprotected, leaving a free amine group that has utility for further reaction with NHS-esters, isothiocyanates, etc. (Fig. 2). In the case of GAGs, the normal acetyl groups on glucosamine residues are unaffected by mild base treatment (16.Sheng J. Liu R. Xu Y. Liu J. The dominating role of N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 1 in forming domain structures in heparan sulfate.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but the TFA group on the glucosamine is removed, revealing the underlying free amine. This procedure allows site-specific reactions including installation of N-sulfo groups (16.Sheng J. Liu R. Xu Y. Liu J.

Chem. 2011; 286: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). By comparing the ability of the various chimera constructs to transfer two hexosamine UDP-sugar analogs, we have been able to tentatively identify regions of the respective polypeptides that impact analog specificity (Fig. 3). As evident in Reactions 1–3 below, the monosaccharide unit of a UDP-hexosamine (HexN) plays multiple roles in polymerization catalyzed by a GAG synthase. First, it binds and is transferred by the hexosamine-transferase component (Reaction 1). Second, the residue binds to the GlcUA-transferase site and serves as part of an acceptor (Reaction 2). As the chain is extended with a second hexosamine, the original unit now serves as part of an acceptor in the HexN-transferase site (Reaction 3). Therefore, an unnatural analog has to interact with multiple binding sites and to be compatible with various catalytic processes to support repetitive polymerization by a GAG synthase. It should be noted that the acceptors are hypothesized to make a series of contacts with each of the glycosyltransferases of a bifunctional synthase. If the acceptor pocket interacts with a tetrasaccharide or greater size portion of the nascent chain, then an acceptor containing multiple hexosamine analogs making multiple potentially unfavorable contacts will become an increasingly poor acceptor as more analog units are added. In all cases where the chimeric enzyme was active, polypeptides containing the putative PmHS1 GlcUA-transferase site region (PmHS1134–318) had the ability to transfer 6N3-GlcNAc (Chimeras B, D, G, and J, Fig. 3). None of the constructs that lacked this region of PmHS1 had the ability to transfer the 6N3-GlcNAc sugar analog. In summary, usage of this hexosamine analog tracks with the uronic acid-transferase domain of PmHS1. We hypothesize that for PmHS2 and chimeras lacking the PmHS1 GlcUA-transferase region (PmHS1134–318), the inability to generate polysaccharide using the UDP-6N3-GlcNAc donor is probably due to an as yet unidentified deficiency in acceptor binding or positioning in the PmHS2 GlcUA-transferase domain. Although we do observe low activity by wild-type PmHS1 toward the transfer of GlcN-TFA (Fig. 4C), we have been unable to readily generate long polysaccharide chains containing this sugar analog (data not shown). It appears that PmHS1 may be able to transfer one or two of these sugar units, but the subsequent transfer of sugar units falters. This result indicates that incorporation of GlcN-TFA by PmHS1 does not fail due to donor binding. Instead, it is possible that more than one or two of these unnatural sugar units in the nascent acceptor polysaccharide a"

In neurons, neurexins bind to both sub-plasma membrane and synaptic vesicle-associated constituents of the secretory machinery, play a key role in the organization and stabilization of the presynaptic active zone, and help mediate docking of synaptic vesicles. We have previously shown that neurexins, like many other protein constituents of the neurotransmitter exocytotic machinery, are expressed in pancreatic β cells. We hypothesized that the role of neurexins in β cells parallels their role in neurons, with β-cell neurexins helping to mediate insulin granule docking and secretion. Here we demonstrate that β cells express a more restricted pattern of neurexin transcripts than neurons, with a clear predominance of neurexin-1α expressed in isolated islets. Using INS-1E β cells, we found that neurexin-1α interacts with membrane-bound components of the secretory granule-docking machinery and with the granule-associated protein granuphilin. Decreased expression of neurexin-1α, like decreased expression of granuphilin, reduces granule docking at the β-cell membrane and improves insulin secretion. Perifusion of neurexin-1α KO mouse islets revealed a significant increase in second-phase insulin secretion with a trend toward increased first-phase secretion. Upon glucose stimulation, neurexin-1α protein levels decrease. This glucose-induced down-regulation may enhance glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We conclude that neurexin-1α is a component of the β-cell secretory machinery and contributes to secretory granule docking, most likely through interactions with granuphilin.

Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of insulin granule docking and exocytosis. β cells share many similarities with neurons, including the expression of many of the same scaffolding and exocytotic proteins (1.Abderrahmani A.

Advances in the neurobiology field regarding synaptic maturation and function thus frequently offer important clues regarding overall β-cell function and the mechanisms underlying insulin secretion. Neurexins (NRXNs) 2The abbreviations used are: NRXNneurexinSEAPsecreted alkaline phosphataseIPimmunoprecipitationqPCRreal-time quantitative PCRISRinsulin secretion rateAUCarea under the curve. are a family of synaptic adhesion molecules that function as neuronal cell-surface receptors and signaling proteins (4.Missler M.

Based on the similarities between neurotransmitter exocytosis and insulin secretion, we hypothesized that NRXNs in the β-cell are constituents of the insulin secretory machinery, perhaps helping to mediate secretory granule docking via interactions with granuphilin. In the present study we examined the role of NRXN1α in β-cell function. Our data show that NRXN1α is an integral component of the secretory granule docking machinery. Like other proteins that contribute to the granuphilin-mediated docking of secretory granules at the β-cell membrane, NRXN1α inhibits insulin secretion (28.Regazzi R. Ravazzola M. Iezzi M. Lang J.

The following antibodies were obtained commercially: goat anti-NRXN1 (P-15), goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, and goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit anti-granuphilin (Atlas Antibodies); mouse anti-syntaxin 1 and -GAPDH (Sigma-Aldrich); mouse anti-synaptophysin, -CASK and -Munc18 (BD Biosciences); rabbit anti-GFP/CFP and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes); guinea pig anti-NRXN1α and donkey anti-guinea pig-Cy3 (Millipore); guinea pig anti-insulin (Dako); biotinylated goat anti-guinea pig IgG (Vector Laboratories); and IRDye 680-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and IRDye 800CW-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (LI-COR). To detect NRXN expression by immunoblotting, we raised a polyclonal, pan-NRXN antibody against a previously described NRXN peptide (15.O'Connor V.M. Shamotienko O. Grishin E. Betz H.

https://openalex.org/W2082676381,"Keratins are cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins providing crucial structural support in epithelial cells. Keratin expression has diagnostic and even prognostic value in disease settings, and recent studies have uncovered modulatory roles for select keratin proteins in signaling pathways regulating cell growth and cell death. Elevated keratin expression in select cancers is correlated with higher expression of EGF receptor (EGFR), whose overexpression and/or mutation give rise to cancer. To explore the role of keratins in oncogenic signaling pathways, we examined the regulation of epithelial growth-associated keratin 17 (K17) in response to EGFR activation. K17 is specifically up-regulated in detergent-soluble fraction upon EGFR activation, and immunofluorescence analysis revealed alterations in K17-containing filaments. Interestingly, we identified AnxA2 as a novel interacting partner of K17, and this interaction is antagonized by EGFR activation. K17 and AnxA2 proteins show reciprocal regulation. Modulating expression of AnxA2 altered K17 stability, and AnxA2 overexpression delays EGFR-mediated change in K17 detergent solubility. Down-regulation of K17 expression, in turn, results in decreased AnxA2 phosphorylation at Tyr-23. These findings uncover a novel interaction involving K17 and AnxA2 and identify AnxA2 as a potential regulator of keratin filaments. Keratins are cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins providing crucial structural support in epithelial cells. Keratin expression has diagnostic and even prognostic value in disease settings, and recent studies have uncovered modulatory roles for select keratin proteins in signaling pathways regulating cell growth and cell death.

https://openalex.org/W2050127411,"Both the probability of a mutation occurring and the ability of the mutant to persist will influence the distribution of mutants that arise in a population. We studied the interaction of these factors for the in vitro selection of rifampicin (RIF)-resistant mutants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We characterised two series of spontaneous RIF-resistant in vitro mutants from isoniazid (INH)-sensitive and -resistant laboratory strains and clinical isolates, representing various M. tuberculosis genotypes. The first series were selected from multiple parallel 1 ml cultures and the second from single 10 ml cultures. RIF-resistant mutants were screened by Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) or by sequencing the rpoB gene. For all strains the mutation rate for RIF resistance was determined with a fluctuation assay. The most striking observation was a shift towards rpoB-S531L (TCG→TTG) mutations in a panel of laboratory-generated INH-resistant mutants selected from the 10-ml cultures (p<0.001). All tested strains showed similar mutation rates (1.33×10⁻⁸ to 2.49×10⁻⁷) except one of the laboratory-generated INH mutants with a mutation rate measured at 5.71×10⁻⁷, more than 10 times higher than that of the INH susceptible parental strain (5.46-7.44×10⁻⁸). No significant, systematic difference in the spectrum of rpoB-mutations between strains of different genotypes was observed. The dramatic shift towards rpoB-S531L in our INH-resistant laboratory mutants suggests that the relative fitness of resistant mutants can dramatically impact the distribution of (subsequent) mutations that accumulate in a M. tuberculosis population, at least in vitro. We conclude that, against specific genetic backgrounds, certain resistance mutations are particularly likely to spread. Molecular screening for these (combinations of) mutations in clinical isolates could rapidly identify these particular pathogenic strains. We therefore recommend that isolates are screened for the distribution of resistance mutations, especially in regions that are highly endemic for (multi)drug resistant tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2032125969,"Objective To investigate the differences between the gene expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from normal controls and patients with Kashin-Beck disease (KBD). Methods Twenty KBD patients and 12 normal subjects were selected from a KBD-endemic area and divided into four pairs of KBD vs. control (KBD, n = 5 per pair; control, n = 3 per pair). RNAs were respectively isolated from KBD PBMCs and normal PBMCs. Gene expression profiles were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarray. The gene expression profiles in PBMCs from KBD patients and normal controls were compared and the differentially expressed genes were identified. The obtained microarray data was further confirmed by using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results Approximately 501 genes, corresponding to 2.4% of the total probe transcripts, showed a 2-fold change in differential expression. 19.4% (97 out of 501)of the differentially expressed genes were commonly detected in all the four pairs. Among the 97 differentially expressed genes, 83 genes were up-regulated and 14 genes were down-regulated, compared with those in the normal controls. Some differentially expressed genes were found to be related to functions such as immunity, metabolism, apoptosis, cystoskeleton and cell movement, and extracellular matrix. The validity of our microarray data were supported by the results of qRT-PCR assay. Conclusion Differences in the PBMC gene expression profile between the KBD patients and the normal controls exhibited a similar pattern among all the four pairs of microarrays examined, indicating that the suppressed immunity may play an important role in the pathogenesis of KBD."
https://openalex.org/W2024264329,"Peptides corresponding to N- and C-terminal heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2, respectively) of viral fusion proteins can block infection of viruses in a dominant negative manner by interfering with refolding of the viral HR1 and HR2 to form a six-helix bundle (6HB) that drives fusion between viral and host cell membranes. The 6HB of the HIV gp41 (endogenous bundle) consists of an HR1 coiled-coil trimer with grooves lined by antiparallel HR2 helices. HR1 peptides form coiled-coil oligomers that may bind to gp41 HR2 as trimers to form a heterologous 6HB (inhibitor bundle) or to gp41 HR1 as monomers or dimers to form a heterologous coiled coil. To gain insights into mechanisms of Env entry and inhibition by HR1 peptides, we compared resistance to a peptide corresponding to 36 residues in gp41 HR1 (N36) and the same peptide with a coiled-coil trimerization domain fused to its N terminus (IZN36) that stabilizes the trimer and increases inhibitor potency (Eckert, D. M., and Kim, P. S. (2001) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 98, 11187-11192). Whereas N36 selected two genetic pathways with equal probability, each defined by an early mutation in either HR1 or HR2, IZN36 preferentially selected the HR1 pathway. Both pathways conferred cross-resistance to both peptides. Each HR mutation enhanced the thermostability of the endogenous 6HB, potentially allowing the virus to simultaneously escape inhibitors targeting either gp41 HR1 or HR2. These findings inform inhibitor design and identify regions of plasticity in the highly conserved gp41 that modulate virus entry and escape from HR1 peptide inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1981545007,"Background Web-based, free-text documents on science and technology have been increasing growing on the web. However, most of these documents are not immediately processable by computers slowing down the acquisition of useful information. Computational ontologies might represent a possible solution by enabling semantically machine readable data sets. But, the process of ontology creation, instantiation and maintenance is still based on manual methodologies and thus time and cost intensive. Method We focused on a large corpus containing information on researchers, research fields, and institutions. We based our strategy on traditional entity recognition, social computing and correlation. We devised a semi automatic approach for the recognition, correlation and extraction of named entities and relations from textual documents which are then used to create, instantiate, and maintain an ontology. Results We present a prototype demonstrating the applicability of the proposed strategy, along with a case study describing how direct and indirect relations can be extracted from academic and professional activities registered in a database of curriculum vitae in free-text format. We present evidence that this system can identify entities to assist in the process of knowledge extraction and representation to support ontology maintenance. We also demonstrate the extraction of relationships among ontology classes and their instances. Conclusion We have demonstrated that our system can be used for the conversion of research information in free text format into database with a semantic structure. Future studies should test this system using the growing number of free-text information available at the institutional and national levels."
https://openalex.org/W2140013867,"Strong effects of predator chemical cues on prey are common in aquatic and marine ecosystems, but are thought to be rare in terrestrial systems and specifically for arthropods. For ants, herbivores are hypothesized to eavesdrop on ant chemical communication and thereby avoid predation or confrontation. Here I tested the effect of ant chemical cues on herbivore choice and herbivory. Using Margaridisa sp. flea beetles and leaves from the host tree (Conostegia xalapensis), I performed paired-leaf choice feeding experiments. Coating leaves with crushed ant liquids (Azteca instabilis), exposing leaves to ant patrolling prior to choice tests (A. instabilis and Camponotus textor) and comparing leaves from trees with and without A. instabilis nests resulted in more herbivores and herbivory on control (no ant-treatment) relative to ant-treatment leaves. In contrast to A. instabilis and C. textor, leaves previously patrolled by Solenopsis geminata had no difference in beetle number and damage compared to control leaves. Altering the time A. instabilis patrolled treatment leaves prior to choice tests (0-, 5-, 30-, 90-, 180-min.) revealed treatment effects were only statistically significant after 90- and 180-min. of prior leaf exposure. This study suggests, for two ecologically important and taxonomically diverse genera (Azteca and Camponotus), ant chemical cues have important effects on herbivores and that these effects may be widespread across the ant family. It suggests that the effect of chemical cues on herbivores may only appear after substantial previous ant activity has occurred on plant tissues. Furthermore, it supports the hypothesis that herbivores use ant chemical communication to avoid predation or confrontation with ants."
https://openalex.org/W1992124845,"The von Willebrand factor (VWF) A1-glycoprotein (GP) Ibα interaction is of major importance during thrombosis mainly at sites of high shear stress. Inhibitors of this interaction prevent platelet-dependent thrombus formation in vivo, without major bleeding complications. However, the size and/or protein nature of the inhibitors currently in development limit oral bioavailability and clinical development. We therefore aimed to search for a small molecule protein-protein interaction inhibitor interfering with the VWF-GPIbα binding. After determination of putative small molecule binding pockets on the surface of VWF-A1 and GPIbα using site-finding algorithms and molecular dynamics, high throughput molecular docking was performed on both binding partners. A selection of compounds showing good in silico docking scores into the predicted pockets was retained for testing their in vitro effect on VWF-GPIbα complex formation, by which we identified a compound that surprisingly stimulated the VWF-GPIbα binding in a ristocetin cofactor ELISA and increased platelet adhesion in whole blood to collagen under arterial shear rate but in contrast inhibited ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation. The selected compound adhering to the predicted binding partner GPIbα could be confirmed by saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy. We thus clearly identified a small molecule that modulates VWF-GPIbα binding and that will now serve as a starting point for further studies and chemical modifications to fully characterize the interaction and to manipulate specific activity of the compound."
https://openalex.org/W2086863107,"GAT-1 mediates transport of GABA together with sodium and chloride in an electrogenic process enabling efficient GABAergic transmission. Biochemical and modeling studies based on the structure of the bacterial homologue LeuT are consistent with a mechanism whereby the binding pocket is alternately accessible to either side of the membrane and which predicts that the extracellular part of transmembrane domain 10 (TM10) exhibits aqueous accessibility in the outward-facing conformation only. In this study we have engineered cysteine residues in the extracellular half of TM10 of GAT-1 and probed their state-dependent accessibility to sulfhydryl reagents. In three out of four of the accessible cysteine mutants, the inhibition of transport by a membrane impermeant sulfhydryl reagent was diminished under conditions expected to increase the proportion of inward-facing transporters, such as the presence of GABA together with the cotransported ions. A conserved TM10 aspartate residue, whose LeuT counterpart participates in a ""thin"" extracellular gate, was found to be essential for transport and only the D451E mutant exhibited residual transport activity. D451E exhibited robust sodium-dependent transient currents with a voltage-dependence indicative of an increased apparent affinity for sodium. Moreover the accessibility of an endogenous cysteine to a membrane impermeant sulfhydryl reagent was enhanced by the D451E mutation, suggesting that sodium binding promotes an outward-facing conformation of the transporter. Our results support the idea that TM10 of GAT-1 lines an accessibility pathway from the extracellular space into the binding pocket and plays a role in the opening and closing of the extracellular transporter gate."

Once prepared, A-I dHDL particles were repurified using a tandem SEC setup (Superdex 200 and Superose 6, GE Healthcare) to remove any lipids and proteins not bound to the particles. For apoA-I and apoA-II mixed discoidal HDL (A-I/A-II dHDL) reconstitution, repurified A-I dHDL was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 20 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to fully equilibrate various conformational subpopulations of A-I dHDL. Next, apoA-II was introduced at a molar ratio of 200:95 apoA-I:apoA-II, and the solution was incubated at 4 °C for an additional 48 h. This ratio has been reported to generate mixed apoA-I and apoA-II particles without displacing any apoA-I from 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) particles (11.Durbin D.M. Jonas A.

SEC analysis carried out upon apoA-II introduction into A-I dHDL confirmed that there was no detectable displaced apoA-I from the particles. Hence A-I/A-II dHDL particles were used in the study without a SEC purification step. The A-I/A-II dHDL were concentrated by ultrafiltration to 1 mg/ml of total protein and then used for analysis within 3 days. The final composition of A-I dHDL and A-I/A-II dHDL are reported in Table 1.TABLE 1Characterization of A-I dHDL and A-I/A-II dHDL particles used in the studyParticleParticle diameter by PAGEaParticle diameters were calculated from native PAGE of particles with respect to a known set of high Mr standards (GE Healthcare, catalog number 17-0445-01).

The total protein concentration was determined by modified Markwell Lowry protein assay (28.Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E.

Deuterium incorporation into the amide backbone of apoA-I in A-I dHDL and A-I/A-II dHDL as a function of time was monitored using three independent A-I dHDL and A-I/A-II dHDL particle preparations. The experiments were carried out adapting the methods reported before as required for the mass spectrometry system available to us (QStar-XL, AB Sciex, Foster City, CA). The detailed methodology for the experimental approach is given under supplemental “Experimental Procedures” (30.Zhang Z. Smith D.L. Determination of amide hydrogen exchange by mass spectrometry.

Differences in surface exposure of Lys residues on apoA-I incorporated in A-I dHDL and A-I/A-II dHDL were monitored, subjecting three independent particle preparations to acetic anhydride (Ac2O) modifications. The methodology details are given under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Limited tryptic digestion experiments on A-I dHDL and A-I/A-II dHDL were carried out using similar experimental conditions as reported before (11.Durbin D.M. Jonas A. The effect of apolipoprotein A-II on the structure and function of apolipoprotein A-I in a homogeneous reconstituted high density lipoprotein particle.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31333-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Two sets of independently prepared particles were subjected to proteolysis. A-I dHDL and A-I/A-II dHDL particles for LCAT assay were prepared as described above, except that in addition to apoA-I and POPC, these particles contained a small amount of free cholesterol (FC). For A-I dHDL the starting proportion of POPC:FC:apoA-I was 80:5:1. From the total amount of FC, about 10% of FC consisted of tritiated [3H]cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The amounts of [3H]cholesterol were chosen for the final particles used in the assay (0.5 mg/ml, 20 μl sample volume) to result in 5000 cpm. The particle diameters, based on native PAGE, were identical to the particles used in HDX-MS and Ac2O modification experiments (data not shown). The assay was performed as reported before (11.Durbin D.M. Jonas A.

Upon LCAT reaction, the entire lipid content was extracted and separated using thin layer chromatography (TLC) using a solvent system containing petroleum ether:ethyl ether:acetic acid (85:15:1). Separated FC and cholesteryl ester (CE) bands were scraped from TLC plates and the amounts of [3H]cholesterol in each band were determined by scintillation counting. Statistical analyses were performed on data collected from three independent particle preparations using a two-tailed equal variance t test. Statistical comparisons were made between the sets of similar apoA-I peptides generated from A-I dHDL and A-I/A-II dHDL. There are no statistical corrections on the data sets for multiple peptide comparisons. To understand the interactions between apoA-I and apoA-II, we reconstituted a stable A-I/A-II dHDL particle with a highly defined composition. Durbin and Jonas (11.Durbin D.M. Jonas A.

They reported that apoA-II could displace apoA-I from discoidal HDL when apoA-II exceeds the 2:1 apoA-I:apoA-II ratio, but not below. Based on the average protein ratios used, the particles were reported to contain two molecules of apoA-I and one molecule apoA-II. We began by applying this method to produce stable mixed particles. However, we chose to use POPC as the lipid, rather than DPPC, as it is more representative of the fluid mixed chain lipids found in plasma HDL. During our initial attempts, we used 1 mg/ml of particle concentration and a 20-min incubation step upon apoA-II introduction, as was reported before (11.Durbin D.M. Jonas A.

These conditions generated particles that appeared homogeneous by native PAGE, but were found to be heterogeneous in terms of apolipoprotein stoichiometry per particle upon particle cross-linking followed by SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). Given that particles prepared with only apoA-I and only apoA-II generate particles with almost identical hydrodynamic diameters (26.Silva R.A. Hilliard G.M. Li L. Segrest J.P. Davidson W.S.

Upon further experimentation, we found that it was necessary to incubate the parent A-I dHDL particles for 48 h at 37 °C prior to the introduction of apoA-II. Moreover, the incubation must be carried out at a low particle concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, because incubations at high concentrations resulted in the change of particle diameter with generation of heterogeneous particle populations as seen by native PAGE (data not shown). Upon apoA-II introduction, particles were incubated for another 48 h. A-I/A-II dHDL particles were generated using our optimized method, exhibited a comparable Stokes diameter to the parental A-I dHDL particles, as seen by native PAGE (Fig. 1A and Table 1).

https://openalex.org/W2003359584,"Evaluation of a quick and easy model to determine the intrinsic ability of clinical strains to generate active TB has been set by assuming that this is linked to the fitness of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain at the innate phase of the infection. Thus, the higher the bacillary load, the greater the possibility of inducting liquefaction, and thus active TB, once the adaptive response is set.The virulence of seven clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated in Spain was tested by determining the bacillary concentration in the spleen and lung of mice at weeks 0, 1 and 2 after intravenous (IV) inoculation of 10⁴ CFU, and by determining the growth in vitro until the stationary phase had been reached. Cord distribution automated analysis showed two clear patterns related to the high and low fitness in the lung after IV infection. This pattern was not seen in the in vitro fitness tests, which clearly favored the reference strain (H37Rv). Subsequent determination using a more physiological low-dose aerosol (AER) inoculation with 10² CFU showed a third pattern in which the three best values coincided with the highest dissemination capacity according to epidemiological data.The fitness obtained after low dose aerosol administration in the presence of the innate immune response is the most predictive factor for determining the virulence of clinical strains. This gives support to a mechanism of the induction of active TB derived from the dynamic hypothesis of latent tuberculosis infection."
https://openalex.org/W1989706328,"Although complex diseases and traits are thought to have multifactorial genetic basis, the common methods in genome-wide association analyses test each variant for association independent of the others. This computational simplification may lead to reduced power to identify variants with small effect sizes and requires correcting for multiple hypothesis tests with complex relationships. However, advances in computational methods and increase in computational resources are enabling the computation of models that adhere more closely to the theory of multifactorial inheritance. Here, a Bayesian variable selection and model averaging approach is formulated for searching for additive and dominant genetic effects. The approach considers simultaneously all available variants for inclusion as predictors in a linear genotype-phenotype mapping and averages over the uncertainty in the variable selection. This leads to naturally interpretable summary quantities on the significances of the variants and their contribution to the genetic basis of the studied trait. We first characterize the behavior of the approach in simulations. The results indicate a gain in the causal variant identification performance when additive and dominant variation are simulated, with a negligible loss of power in purely additive case. An application to the analysis of high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in a dataset of 3895 Finns is then presented, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach at the current scale of single-nucleotide polymorphism data. We describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the computation and give suggestions on the specification of prior parameters using commonly available prior information. An open-source software implementing the method is available at http://www.lce.hut.fi/research/mm/bmagwa/ and https://github.com/to-mi/."
https://openalex.org/W2065030772,"Many viruses use a pH-dependent pathway for fusion with host cell membrane, the mechanism of which is still poorly understood. Here we report that a subtle leucine (Leu)-valine (Val) change at position 501 in the envelope glycoproteins (Envs) of two related retroviruses, jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) and enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV), is responsible for their distinct low pH requirements for membrane fusion and infection. The Leu and Val residues are predicted to reside within the C-terminal heptad repeat (HR2) region of JSRV and ENTV Envs, particularly proximal to the hairpin turn of the putative six-helix bundle (6HB). Substitution of the JSRV Leu with a Val blocked the Env-mediated membrane fusion at pH 5.0, whereas replacement of the ENTV Val with a Leu rendered the ENTV Env capable of fusing at pH 5.0. A Leu-Val change has no apparent effect on the stability of native Env, but appears to stabilize an intermediate induced by receptor binding. These results are consistent with the existence of at least two metastable conformations of these viral glycoproteins, the native prefusion conformation and a receptor-induced metastable intermediate. Collectively, this work represents an interesting perhaps unique example whereby a simple Leu-Val change has critical impact on pH-dependent virus fusion and entry."

These features clearly indicate that QHNDH must undergo various posttranslational modifications to attain its amine-oxidizing activity in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria. Not necessarily in the given order, these modifications are 1) formation of the three intrapeptidyl thioether cross-links and CTQ in the γ subunit, 2) removal of the signal peptides during the periplasmic translocation of the α and β subunits, 3) insertion of the two hemes in the α subunit, and 4) association of the subunits to form active QHNDH. The manner, timing, location, and order of these modifications, which could occur as either independent events in a single subunit or coordinated processes involving dimeric or trimeric subunit complexes, remain unclear. The mechanism of the periplasmic translocation of the γ subunit, without signal peptides, is also unknown. quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase cysteine tryptophylquinone S-adenosylmethionine. The structural genes encoding the QHNDH subunits constitute an operon harboring at least five ORFs that may be transcribed synchronously by an amine inducer (Fig. 1C). In this operon, the α, β, and γ subunit polypeptides are encoded by ORF1, ORF4, and ORF3, respectively. ORF2, intervening between the genes for the α and γ subunits, encodes a putative [Fe-S] cluster- and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-binding protein, belonging to the “radical AdoMet superfamily,” which includes various proteins involved in vitamin biosynthesis and posttranslational activation of other enzymes adjacently encoded in the genome (7.Sofia H.J.

We previously demonstrated that ORF2 of P. denitrificans plays an essential role in the posttranslational processing of the γ subunit, most likely by participating in intrapeptidyl thioether cross-link formation via an [Fe-S] cluster- and AdoMet-dependent mechanism (8.Ono K.

This leader peptide is atypical as a signal peptide for the periplasmic translocation of the γ subunit and instead seems to participate in the cytoplasmic processing of the γ subunit, e.g. serving as a primer or scaffold for intrapeptidyl thioether cross-link formation by ORF2. ORF5 encodes an ∼22.5 kDa protein belonging to subfamily S8A of peptidase family S8 (subtilisin family), as revealed by a sequence similarity search in a protein database (supplemental Fig. S1).

Protocols for construction of plasmid vectors, growth conditions, homologous recombination, and site-directed mutagenesis were mostly conventional and are described in detail in the supplemental information. E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with pET-ORF5 (supplemental Fig. S2) and pRARE encoding tRNAs for rare codons of E. coli, and then grown at 37 °C in a Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μm ampicillin and 34 μm chloramphenicol to a mid-logarithmic phase. After addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.15 mm), cells were further cultivated at 30 °C for 4 h, harvested by centrifugation, and washed with 0.85% NaCl. Washed cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm imidazole and 0.5 m NaCl (buffer C). After ultrasonic disruption of the cells, the cell extract was collected by centrifugation and loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap FF crude column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer C. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of buffer C. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 50–300 mm imidazole. Fractions containing His6-tagged ORF5 were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES (pH 6.5), containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100 (buffer D). Insoluble aggregates were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant solution was applied to a 5-ml HiTrap SP FF column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer D. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of buffer D. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 50–500 mm NaCl in buffer D. His6-tagged ORF5 expressed in PdKO7/pRK-H6ORF5 was also purified as described above using a 1-ml Resource PHE column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 1.35 m ammonium sulfate in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) instead of the HiTrap SP column. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 1.35–0 m ammonium sulfate in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer. For both purifications, fractions containing His6-tagged ORF5 were pooled, concentrated, and stored at 4 °C until use. ΔORF5 strain PdKO7 was cultured in a medium containing 0.5% (w/v) n-butylamine and 20 mm choline·HCl as described in supplemental experimental procedures. The spheroplasts prepared from the cultured cells as described previously (8.Ono K. Okajima T. Tani M. Kuroda S. Sun D. Davidson V.L. Tanizawa K. Involvement of a putative [Fe-S] cluster-binding protein in the biogenesis of quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase.J. Biol.

The spheroplasts were disrupted by sonication, and the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 60 min. Formic acid was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1.5% (v/v), and the precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min. CH3CN was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10% (v/v), and this solution was applied to the solid-phase extraction column (SiliaBond® C4, 25 ml, 5 g, SiliCycle) pre-equilibrated with 10% CH3CN in 0.1% TFA, followed by washing thoroughly with 0.1% TFA in 20% CH3CN. The polypeptide was eluted with 50% CH3CN in 0.1% TFA. Fractions containing the γ subunit polypeptide were detected by Western blotting (8.Ono K. Okajima T. Tani M. Kuroda S. Sun D. Davidson V.L. Tanizawa K. Involvement of a putative [Fe-S] cluster-binding protein in the biogenesis of quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13672-13684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The eluate was diluted 2-fold with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 6 m urea, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The suspension was then applied to a 1-ml HiTrap Q FF column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer, and the peptide was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 M NaCl in the buffer. Fractions containing the γ subunit polypeptide were pooled, and formic acid was added to a final concentration of 1.5%. The γ subunit polypeptide was further purified on an HPLC system (Hitachi, L-7100) using a C18 reversed-phase column (Tosoh, TSK-gel Octadecyl-4PW, 4.6 × 150 mm). The sample was loaded onto the column pre-equilibrated with 20% CH3CN containing 0.1% TFA, and the column was washed thoroughly with the same solvent. The γ subunit polypeptide was eluted with a 50-min linear gradient of 20–35% (10 min), 35–50% (30 min), and 50–80% (10 min) CH3CN containing 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing the γ subunit polypeptide were collected and concentrated with a centrifugal concentrator (Tomy, CC-180). The second HPLC separation was repeated, and the resultant sample was concentrated and used for mass spectrometric analysis. Two synthetic heptapeptides N- or C-terminally labeled with fluorescein (N- or C-Flc), Flc-CO-EVVAMNA-NH2 (Mr = 1090.18) and Ac-EVVAMNA-NHCH2CH2NHCO-Flc (Mr = 1175.29), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Japan. The peptide substrate (20–200 μm) was incubated with the purified ORF5 protein (0.2 mg/ml) at 30 °C in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm DTT. After 15 h, a 20-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was applied to the HPLC system equipped with a C4 reverse phase column (5C4-AR-300, 4.6 mm × 150 mm, Nacalai Tesque) and a fluorescence detector (F-1050, Hitachi). Separation was performed using a 25-min (or 20-min) linear gradient of 0–52% (or 0–80%) CH3CN containing 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, monitored with absorbance at 220 nm and fluorescence at 520 nm upon excitation at 445 nm. HPLC fractions containing the cleaved product from N-Flc substrate bound to ORF5 were collected, dried by vacuum centrifugation, and redissolved in 6 m urea and 94 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). The protein was reduced with 4.6 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and then carboxyamidomethylated with 31 mm iodoacetamide. After addition of excess DTT, the carboxyamidomethylated protein was digested at 37 °C for 16 h with modified trypsin (New England Biolabs). The tryptic digests were applied to the HPLC system equipped with a fluorescence detector as described above. The major fluorescent peaks were collected and dried for mass analysis. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were obtained with an Autoflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser lamp. The samples were prepared on an MTP AnchorChipTM var/384 TF plate (Bruker) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 0.5–1 μl of sample solution was applied onto the target and mixed with 1–2 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (0.3 mg/ml in ethanol:acetone, 2:1) or sinapinic acid (1 mg/ml in CH3CN:0.1% TFA, 9:1) as matrices. All samples were dried and recrystallized by dissolving in 1 μl of ethanol:acetone:0.1% TFA, 6:3:1 (for α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) or CH3CN:0.1% TFA, 9:1 (for sinapinic acid). Measurements were performed in the positive-ion linear mode with delayed extraction. All MALDI spectra were initially calibrated with a peptide or protein calibration standard I kit (Bruker). Electrospray ionization MS was carried out in a positive ion mode on a SYNAPT G1 mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoACQUITY HPLC system (Waters) and a Mass PREP Micro desalting column (Waters, 2.1 × 5 mm). The elution system consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in CH3CN (solvent B) from 0% to 90% B at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. By Western blot analysis with an antiserum raised against ORF5 expressed in E. coli, we confirmed ORF5 expression in WT P. denitrificans Pd1222 cells grown in n-butylamine-containing medium but not in cells grown in medium containing glucose as the energy and carbon source (Fig. 2A). This finding indicates that ORF5 is a gene in the n-butylamine-utilizing operon of P. denitrificans and its expression is controlled under the same promoter as the structural genes for the QHNDH subunits. However, the amount of ORF5 in Pd1222 was estimated to be only about 8% of the QHNDH β subunit (∼12% by molar amount) by quantitative Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B). Presumably, because of an N-terminal sequence that follows the “N-end rule” (11.Hirel P.H. Schmitter M.J. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Extent of N-terminal methionine excision from Escherichia coli proteins is governed by the side-chain length of the penultimate amino acid.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The N-end rule in bacteria.Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1), ORF5 may be rapidly degraded even if its expression is induced to a similar amount as in the QHNDH subunits. Indeed, the amount of ORF5 was also very small when it was expressed through broad host-range plasmid pRK415 with multiple copies (13.Keen N.T. Tamaki S. Kobayashi D. Trollinger D. Improved broad-host-range plasmids for DNA cloning in gram-negative bacteria.Gene. 1988; 70: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar), in marked contrast to the abundant N-terminal His6-tagged protein (N-His6-ORF5) expressed through the same plasmid (Fig. 2B), which avoided degradation because of the N-end rule. Consistent with the absence of a sequence characteristic of a signal peptide in the N-terminal region (see GenBanktm AB063330), ORF5 was detected only in the cytoplasmic fraction of Pd1222 (Fig. 2C). Therefore, ORF5 probably functions in the cytoplasm similarly to the ORF2-encoded [Fe-S] cluster/AdoMet-binding protein (8.Ono K. Okajima T. Tani M. Kuroda S. Sun D. Davidson V.L. Tanizawa K.

Chem. 2006; 281: 13672-13684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and unlike QHNDH, which occurs in the periplasm (1.Takagi K. Torimura M. Kawaguchi K. Kano K. Ikeda T.

Pd1222 cells grew efficiently in minimum mineral medium containing n-butylamine as the sole carbon and energy source and showed a high level of QHNDH activity, whereas cells of a ΔORF5 mutant strain (PdKO7, Fig. 2A) neither grew nor showed QHNDH activity in the same medium (Fig. 3, A and B). Nevertheless, the QHNDH subunit polypeptides were produced even in PdKO7 cells grown in the medium containing n-butylamine and choline (Fig. 2, D and E). The latter compound was added to support the n-butylamine-independent growth of P. denitrificans (14.Page M.D. Ferguson S.J. Differential reduction in soluble and membrane-bound c-type cytochrome contents in a Paracoccus denitrificans mutant partially deficient in 5-aminolevulinate synthase activity.J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5919-5928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that the QHNDH subunit polypeptides are produced in PdKO7 but do not form active QHNDH. Therefore, ORF5 is essential for bacterial growth in medium containing n-butylamine as the sole carbon and energy source, which is oxidized by active QHNDH in the periplasm. Consistent with the presence of N-terminal-flanking signal peptides in both the α and the β subunits (4.Vandenberghe I. Kim J.K. Devreese B. Hacisalihoglu A. Iwabuki H. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Adachi O.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14268-14273Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the two subunits were localized exclusively to the periplasmic fractions of Pd1222 and PdKO7 (Fig. 2D). By using an antibody against the C-terminal region of the γ subunit, the γ subunit polypeptide was also detected in the periplasmic fraction of Pd1222 (Fig. 2E). In contrast, this polypeptide was predominantly detected in the cytoplasmic fraction of PdKO7. Moreover, the cytoplasmic γ subunit of PdKO7 retained the N-terminal leader peptide, which was completely undetectable in the γ subunit of Pd1222 (Fig. 2E). The mass difference of ∼4 kDa is also consistent with the presence of the leader peptide in the cytoplasmic γ subunit of PdKO7. Similar cytoplasmic localization and retention of the leader peptide has been observed in the γ subunit of a ΔORF2 mutant strain, PdKO4 (8.Ono K. Okajima T. Tani M. Kuroda S. Sun D. Davidson V.L. Tanizawa K. Involvement of a putative [Fe-S] cluster-binding protein in the biogenesis of quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13672-13684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When PdKO7 was transformed with a plasmid carrying ORF5 (pRK-ORF5, supplemental Fig. S2), both cell growth and QHNDH activity were significantly recovered in the medium containing n-butylamine as the sole carbon and energy source (Fig. 3, A and B). Noteworthy is that this recovery of QHNDH activity exceeded the activity in Pd1222 by about 50% (Fig. 2B) and appeared to correlate with the intracellular amount of ORF5 (∼50% more in PdKO7/pRK-ORF5 than in Pd1222, Fig. 2B). However, the recovered activity was not increased further, even with N-His6-ORF5 (Fig. 3B), which was produced abundantly (Fig. 2B). Presumably, the increase in QHNDH activity was limited by the amount of QHNDH subunits. The amounts of the β subunit were similar in Pd1222, PdKO7/pRK-ORF5, and PdKO7/pRK-H6ORF5 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the γ subunit of PdKO7/pRK-ORF5 was translocated to the periplasm and completely lost the N-terminal leader peptide (Fig. 2E). These results unequivocally show that ORF5 is necessary for the processing of the γ subunit leader peptide, which eventually leads to the periplasmic formation of active QHNDH, essential for n-butylamine-dependent bacterial growth. To examine whether ORF5 functions as a subtilisin-like protease, the putative catalytic triad (Asp-8/His-39/Ser-177) was mutated individually to Ala. When PdKO7 was transformed with expression plasmids (pRK-ORF5-D8A, pRK-ORF5-H39A, or pRK-ORF5-S177A) constructed for the mutant proteins (supplemental Fig. S2), the cells neither grew well nor exhibited QHNDH activity (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that the γ subunit was mainly present in the cytoplasmic fractions of PdKO7 transformed with these plasmids (supplemental Fig. S3D) and also retained the N-terminal leader peptide (supplemental Fig. S3E). The results strongly suggest that ORF5 is a subtilisin-like protease possessing the Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad and directly cleaves the N-terminal leader peptide. In addition, the γ subunit polypeptides detected slightly in the periplasmic fractions of PdKO7 transformed with the mutant plasmids (supplemental Fig. S3B) still contained the N-terminal leader peptide (supplemental Fig. S3C). This observation suggests that removal of the N-terminal leader peptide itself is not a prerequisite for the periplasmic translocation of the γ subunit and that the leader peptide does not function as a signal peptide, unlike those of the α and β subunits (4.Vandenberghe I. Kim J.K. Devreese B. Hacisalihoglu A. Iwabuki H. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Adachi O. Jongejan J.A. Duine J.A. Tanizawa K. Van Beeumen J.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14268-14273Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the leader peptide may function as a signal peptide (i.e. by directing translocon-dependent translocation into the periplasm) but lacks a signal peptide cleavage site, and the cleavage is instead carried out by ORF5. Although the mechanism of the periplasmic translocation of the γ subunit remains to be clarified, removal of the N-terminal leader peptide is probably necessary for efficient translocation of the γ subunit. To elaborate the posttranslational modification of the γ subunit in PdKO7, the γ subunit polypeptide was purified by repeated HPLC with a C18 reversed-phase column (Fig. 4A). We reported previously that, for purification of the γ subunit from PdKO4, treatment of the peptide with 4-vinylpyridine is necessary before HPLC to block the free SH groups (8.Ono K. Okajima T.

In this study, we addressed the functional consequences of these interactions by examining whether purified Rad27 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae affects the enzymatic activity of Dna2 and vice versa. For this purpose, we constructed Rad27DA (catalytically defective enzyme with an Asp to Ala substitution at amino acid 179) and found that it significantly stimulated the endonuclease activity of wild type Dna2, but failed to do so with Dna2Δ405N that lacks the N-terminal 405 amino acids. This was an unexpected finding because dna2Δ405N cells were still partially suppressed by overexpression of rad27DA in vivo. Further analyses revealed that Rad27 is a trans-autostimulatory enzyme, providing an explanation why overexpression of Rad27, regardless of its catalytic activity, suppressed dna2 mutants as long as an endogenous wild type Rad27 is available. We found that the C-terminal 16-amino acid fragment of Rad27, a highly polybasic region due to the presence of multiple positively charged lysine and arginine residues, was sufficient and necessary for the stimulation of both Rad27 and Dna2.

https://openalex.org/W2036858283,"Background Data on which to base definitive recommendations on the doses and duration of therapy for genotype 3 HCV/HIV-coinfected patients are scarce. We evaluated the efficacy of a lower peginterferon-α 2a dose and a shorter duration of therapy than the current standard of care in genotype 3 HCV/HIV-coinfected patients. Methods and Findings Pilot, open-label, single arm clinical trial which involved 58 Caucasian HCV/HIV-coinfected patients who received weekly 135 µg peginterferon-α 2a plus ribavirin 400 mg twice daily during 20 weeks after attaining undetectable viremia. The relationships between baseline patient-related variables, including IL28B genotype, plasma HCV-RNA, ribavirin dose/kg, peginterferon-α 2a and ribavirin levels with virological responses were analyzed. Only 4 patients showed lack of response and 5 patients dropped out due to adverse events related to the study medication. Overall, sustained virologic response (SVR) rates were 58.3% by intention-to-treat and 71.4% by per protocol analysis, respectively. Among patients with rapid virologic response (RVR), SVR and relapses rates were 92.6% and 7.4%, respectively. No relationships were observed between viral responses and ribavirin dose/kg, peginterferon-α 2a concentrations, ribavirin levels or rs129679860 genotype. Conclusions Weekly 135 µg pegIFN-α 2a could be as effective as the standard 180 µg dose, with a very low incidence of severe adverse events. A 24-week treatment duration appears to be appropriate in patients achieving RVR, but extending treatment up to just 20 weeks beyond negativization of viremia is associated with a high relapse rate in those patients not achieving RVR. There was no influence of IL28B genotype on the virological responses. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00553930"
