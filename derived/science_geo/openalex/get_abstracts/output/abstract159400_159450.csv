https://openalex.org/W2583347981,"Motors generating mechanical force, powered by the hydrolysis of ATP, translocate double-stranded DNA into preformed capsids (proheads) of bacterial viruses and certain animal viruses. Here we describe the motor that packages the double-stranded DNA of the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage phi29 into a precursor capsid. We determined the structure of the head-tail connector--the central component of the phi29 DNA packaging motor--to 3.2 A resolution by means of X-ray crystallography. We then fitted the connector into the electron densities of the prohead and of the partially packaged prohead as determined using cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction analysis. Our results suggest that the prohead plus dodecameric connector, prohead RNA, viral ATPase and DNA comprise a rotary motor with the head-prohead RNA-ATPase complex acting as a stator, the DNA acting as a spindle, and the connector as a ball-race. The helical nature of the DNA converts the rotary action of the connector into translation of the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1677119557,"Non-avian dinosaurs are mostly medium to large-sized animals, and to date all known mature specimens are larger than the most primitive bird, Archaeopteryx. Here we report on a new dromaeosaurid dinosaur, Microraptor zhaoianus gen. et sp. nov., from the Early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning, China. This is the first mature non-avian dinosaur to be found that is smaller than Archaeopteryx, and it eliminates the size disparity between the earliest birds and their closest non-avian theropod relatives. The more bird-like teeth, the Rahonavis-like ischium and the small number of caudal vertebrae of Microraptor are unique among dromaeosaurids and improve our understanding of the morphological transition to birds. The nearly completely articulated foot shows features, such as distally positioned digit I, slender and recurved pedal claws, and elongated penultimate phalanges, that are comparable to those of arboreal birds. The discovery of these in non-avian theropods provides new insights for studying the palaeoecology of some bird-like theropod dinosaurs."

https://openalex.org/W1646671735,"The increasingly sluggish response of a supercooled liquid as it nears its glass transition (for example, refrigerated honey) is prototypical of glassy dynamics found in proteins, neural networks and superconductors. The notion that molecules rearrange cooperatively has long been postulated to explain diverging relaxation times and broadened (non-exponential) response functions near the glass transition. Recently, cooperativity was observed and analysed in colloid glasses and in simulations of binary liquids well above the glass transition. But nanometre-scale studies of cooperativity at the molecular glass transition are lacking. Important issues to be resolved include the precise form of the cooperativity and its length scale, and whether the broadened response is intrinsic to individual cooperative regions, or arises only from heterogeneity in an ensemble of such regions. Here we describe direct observations of molecular cooperativity near the glass transition in polyvinylacetate (PVAc), using nanometre-scale probing of dielectric fluctuations. Molecular clusters switched spontaneously among two to four distinct configurations, producing random telegraph noise. Our analysis of these noise signals and their power spectra reveals that individual clusters exhibit transient dynamical heterogeneity and non-exponential kinetics."

https://openalex.org/W3099064928,"Quantum theory predicts that Bose-Einstein condensation of a spatially homogeneous gas with attractive interactions is precluded by a conventional phase transition into either a liquid or solid. When confined to a trap, however, such a condensate can form, provided that its occupation number does not exceed a limiting value. The stability limit is determined by a balance between the self-attractive forces and a repulsion that arises from position-momentum uncertainty under conditions of spatial confinement. Near the stability limit, self-attraction can overwhelm the repulsion, causing the condensate to collapse. Growth of the condensate is therefore punctuated by intermittent collapses that are triggered by either macroscopic quantum tunnelling or thermal fluctuation. Previous observations of growth and collapse dynamics have been hampered by the stochastic nature of these mechanisms. Here we report direct observations of the growth and subsequent collapse of a 7Li condensate with attractive interactions, using phase-contrast imaging. The success of the measurement lies in our ability to reduce the stochasticity in the dynamics by controlling the initial number of condensate atoms using a two-photon transition to a diatomic molecular state."

https://openalex.org/W3101403501,"The energy source of the anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) is not understood, hence their designation as anomalous. Unlike binary X-ray pulsars, no companions are seen, so the energy cannot be supplied by accretion of matter from a companion star. The loss of rotational energy, which powers radio pulsars, is insufficient to power AXPs. Two models are generally considered: accretion from a large disk left over from the birth process, or decay of a very strong magnetic field (10(15) G) associated with a 'magnetar'. The lack of counterparts at other wavelengths has hampered progress in our understanding of these objects. Here we report deep optical observations of the field around 4U0142+61, which is the brightest AXP in X-rays. The source has no associated supernova remnant, which, together with its spin-down timescale of approximately 10(5) yr (ref. 5), suggests that it may be relatively old. We find an object with peculiar optical colours at the position of the X-ray source, and argue that it is the optical counterpart. The optical emission is too faint to admit the presence of a large accretion disk, but may be consistent with magnetospheric emission from a magnetar."

https://openalex.org/W2322137861,"Wild-type p53 is stabilized and accumulates in the nucleus of DNA damaged cells. The effect of stabilizing p53 is to inhibit cell growth, either through a G1 cell cycle arrest or apoptotic cell death. MDM2 can inhibit p53 activity, in part, by promoting its rapid degradation through the ubiquitin proteolysis pathway. In the current study, MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 was partially inhibited in cells treated with leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of nuclear export. In contrast, levels of ubiquitinated p53 increased in LMB-treated cells, indicating that nuclear export is not required for p53 ubiquitination. To investigate this further, p53 mutants were generated which localize to either the nucleus or cytoplasm, and their susceptibility to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination was assessed. p53 mutants that localized to either the nucleus or the cytoplasm were efficiently ubiquitinated, and their steady-state levels decreased, when coexpressed with MDM2. In addition, an MDM2-mutant that localized to the cytoplasm was able to ubiquitinate and degrade a p53 mutant which was similarly localized in the cytoplasm. Our results indicate that nuclear export is not required for p53 ubiquitination, and that p53 proteins that localize to either the nucleus or cytoplasm can be ubiquitinated and degraded by MDM2."

https://openalex.org/W2058583494,"The radiosensitizing effect of caffeine has been associated with the disruption of multiple DNA damage-responsive cell cycle checkpoints, but several lines of evidence also implicate inhibition of DNA repair. The role of DNA repair inhibition in caffeine radiosensitization remains uncharacterized, and it is unknown which repair process, or lesion, is affected. We show that a radiosensitive cell line, mutant for the RAD51 homolog XRCC2 and defective in homologous recombination repair (HRR), displays significantly diminished caffeine radiosensitization that can be restored by expression of XRCC2. Despite the reduced radiosensitization, caffeine effectively abrogates checkpoints in S and G2 phases in XRCC2 mutant cells indicating that checkpoint abrogation is not sufficient for radiosensitization. Another radiosensitive line, mutant for XRCC3 and defective in HRR, similarly shows reduced caffeine radiosensitization. On the other hand, a radiosensitive mutant (irs-20) of DNA-PKcs with a defect in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is radiosensitized by caffeine to an extent comparable to wild-type cells. In addition, rejoining of radiation-induced DNA DSBs, that mainly reflects NHEJ, remains unaffected by caffeine in XRCC2 and XRCC3 mutants, or their wild-type counterparts. These observations suggest that caffeine targets steps in HRR but not in NHEJ and that abrogation of checkpoint response is not sufficient to explain radiosensitization. Indeed, immortalized fibroblasts from AT patients show caffeine radiosensitization despite the checkpoint defects associated with ATM mutation. We propose that caffeine radiosensitization is mediated by inhibition of stages in DNA DSB repair requiring HRR and that checkpoint disruption contributes by allowing these DSBs to transit into irreparable states. Thus, checkpoints may contribute to genomic stability by promoting error-free HRR."
https://openalex.org/W1582044678,"Up to 10 per cent of the ocean floor consists of plateaux--regions of unusually thick oceanic crust thought to be formed by the heads of mantle plumes. Given the ubiquitous presence of recycled oceanic crust in the mantle source of hotspot basalts, it follows that plateau material should also be an important mantle constituent. Here we show that the geochemistry of the Pleistocene basalts from Logudoro, Sardinia, is compatible with the remelting of ancient ocean plateau material that has been recycled into the mantle. The Sr, Nd and Hf isotope compositions of these basalts do not show the signature of pelagic sediments. The basalts' low CaO/Al2O3 and Ce/Pb ratios, their unradiogenic 206Pb and 208Pb, and their Sr, Ba, Eu and Pb excesses indicate that their mantle source contains ancient gabbros formed initially by plagioclase accumulation, typical of plateau material. Also, the high Th/U ratios of the mantle source resemble those of plume magmas. Geochemically, the Logudoro basalts resemble those from Pitcairn Island, which contain the controversial EM-1 component that has been interpreted as arising from a mantle source sprinkled with remains of pelagic sediments. We argue, instead, that the EM-1 source from these two localities is essentially free of sedimentary material, the geochemical characteristics of these lavas being better explained by the presence of recycled oceanic plateaux. The storage of plume heads in the deep mantle through time offers a convenient explanation for the persistence of chemical and mineralogical layering in the mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2322243000,"Synthesis of cell attachment proteins and cytokines, such as osteopontin (OPN), can promote tumor cell remodeling of the extracellular matrix into an environment that promotes tumor cell attachment and migration. We investigated the transcriptional regulation of OPN in the U-251MG and U-87MG human malignant astrocytoma cell lines. Deletion and mutagenesis analyses of the OPN promoter region identified a proximal promoter element (-24 to -94 relative to the transcription initiation site) that is essential for maintaining high levels of OPN expression in the tumor cells. This element, designated RE-1, consists of two cis-acting elements, RE-1a (-55 to -86) and RE-1b (-22 to -45), which act synergistically to regulate the activity of the OPN promoter. Gel shift assays using nuclear extracts of U-251MG cells demonstrated that RE-1a contains binding sites for transcription factors Sp1, the glucocorticoid receptor, and the E-box-binding factors, whereas RE-1b contains a binding site for the octamer motif-binding protein (OCT-1/OCT-2). Inclusion of antibodies directed toward Myc and OCT-1 in the gel shift assays indicated that Myc and OCT-1 participate in forming DNA-protein complexes on the RE-1a and RE-1b elements, respectively. Our results identify two previously unrecognized elements in the OPN promoter that act synergistically to promote upregulation of OPN synthesis by tumor cells but are regulated by different transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2312867955,"The protein Kinase A (PKA) pathway was found to selectively regulate the function of oncogenic but not non-oncogenic E6 proteins. High risk E6 proteins are phosphorylated at their Dlg/PDZ binding motif at the C-terminus by a PKA like activity. This PKA and PDZ binding module is found only for human PV, is strictly conserved in all the transforming HPVs and is absent in all the low risk HPV types. We present evidence of a conditional regulation of E6 induced degradation of Dlg. HPV18E6 positive but not HPV negative keratinocytes exhibit increased Dlg steady state levels under conditions of high PKA activity, with a concomitant increase in the presence of Dlg at tight junctions. In vitro binding experiments show that E6 phosphorylation by PKA reduces its binding to Dlg and molecular modelling can explain this observation in a structural context. E6 dependent degradation of Dlg in cells with high PKA levels is inhibited and this is dependent on phosphorylation of the PDZ binding site in E6. In contrast, the degradation of p53 induced by E6 is not affected by PKA. We propose a differential regulation of E6 for the ubiquitin mediated degradation of specific E6 target proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1999942847,"Meltrin α/ADAM12 is a member of the ADAM/MDC family proteins characterized by the presence of metalloprotease and disintegrin domains. This protein also contains a single transmembrane domain and a relatively long cytoplasmic domain containing several proline-rich sequences. These sequences are compatible with the consensus sequences for binding the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. To determine whether the proline-rich sequences interact with SH3 domains in several proteins, binding of recombinant SH3 domains to the meltrin α cytoplasmic domain was analysed by pull-down assays. The SH3 domains of Src and Yes bound strongly, but that of Abl or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 subunit did not. Full-length Grb2/Ash bound strongly, whereas its N-terminal SH3 domain alone did less strongly. Src and Grb2 in bovine brain extracts also bound to meltrin α cytoplasmic domain on affinity resin. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody to meltrin α resulted in coprecipitation of Src and Grb2 with meltrin α in cell extracts, suggesting that Src and Grb2 are associated in vivo with meltrin α cytoplasmic domain. This notion was also supported by the findings that exogenously expressed meltrin α cytoplasmic domain coexisted with Src and Grb2 on the membrane ruffles. The C-terminal Tyr901 of meltrin α was phosphorylated both in vitro and in cultured cells by v-Src. These results may imply that meltrin α cytoplasmic domain is involved in a signal transduction for some biological function through the interaction with SH3-containing proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2015042023,"The familial cancer syndrome, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, characterized by a predisposition to renal cell carcinoma and certain other tumor types, is caused by mutational inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Loss of VHL gene function is detected also in the vast majority of sporadic renal cell carcinomas. Previous reports have determined a protective role for VHL in response to serum withdrawal and glucose deprivation. In this study, the effect of UV irradiation on VHL-negative and VHL-positive renal carcinoma cells was examined. VHL-negative 786-O renal carcinoma cells underwent apoptosis following UV irradiation. In contrast, reintroduction of wild-type VHL expression protected 786-O cells from UV-mediated cell death. p53 and Bax levels were equivalent in VHL-negative and VHL-positive 786-O cells. Strikingly, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 underwent proteasome-dependent degradation in VHL-negative 786-O cells following UV treatment. However, p21 and p27 protein levels were stable in VHL-positive cells. Also, levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were elevated in VHL-positive cells, consistent with the protection from apoptotic stimuli. UV treatment led to increased S phase in VHL-negative, but not VHL-positive cells. Thus, following UV irradiation, diminution of p21 and p27 levels resulted in a hyperproliferative state in VHL-negative cells, leading to apoptosis. These results suggest that loss of VHL function promotes apoptosis and may provide selective pressure toward cells that are able to escape apoptosis, leading to tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2326367330,"Expression of oncogenic Ras in epithelial tumor cells is linked to the loss of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) anti-proliferative activity, and was proposed to involve inhibition of Smad2/3 nuclear translocation. Here we studied several epithelial cell lines expressing oncogenic N-RasK61 and show that TGF-beta-induced nuclear translocation of and transcriptional activation by Smad2/3 were unaffected. In contrast, oncogenic Ras mediated nuclearto-cytoplasmic mislocalization of p27KiP1 (p27) and of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) CDK6, but not CDK2. Concomitantly, oncogenic Ras abrogated the ability of TGF-beta to release p27 from CDK6, to enhance its binding to CDK2 and to inhibit CDK2 activity. Inactivation of Ras by a specific antagonist restored the growth inhibitory response to TGF-beta with concurrent normalization of p27 and CDK6 localization. Therefore, the disruption of TGF-beta-mediated growth inhibition by oncogenic Ras appears to be due to lack of inhibition of CDK2, caused by the sequestration of p27 and CDK2 in different subcellular compartments and by the loss of TGF-beta-induced partner switching of p27 from CDK6 to CDK2."
https://openalex.org/W1638263916,"Atoms crammed tightly together in metal crystal surfaces are surprisingly mobile. Atoms in close-packed surfaces of metal crystals move around at surprisingly high rates, even though each atom is locked in tightly by its neighbours. Here we use a low density of indium atoms, embedded in the outermost atomic layer of a copper surface, as tracer particles for scanning tunnelling microscopy to reveal the high vacancy-assisted mobility of atoms in this surface. We believe that most close-packed surfaces of metals and other materials will exhibit a similar vacancy-assisted motion at room temperature, with such surfaces behaving like a gigantic atomic slide-puzzle."
https://openalex.org/W2331808804,"A majority of human colon carcinomas coexpress the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related peptides transforming growth factor α (TGFα), amphiregulin (AR) and CRIPTO-1 (CR). We have synthesized novel, antisense mixed backbone oligonucleotides (AS MBOs) directed against TGFα, AR and CR. We screened the EGF-related AS MBOs for their ability to inhibit the anchorage independent growth of GEO human colon carcinoma cells. The MBOs that showed a high in vitro efficacy were then used for in vivo experiments. TGFα, AR and CR AS MBOs were able to inhibit the growth of GEO tumor xenografts in nude mice in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the AS MBOs were able to specifically inhibit the expression of the target mRNAs and proteins in the tumor xenografts. A more significant tumor growth inhibition was observed when mice were treated with a combination of the three AS MBOs as compared to treatment with a single AS MBO. Finally, tumors from mice treated with TGFα, AR and CR AS MBOs showed a significant reduction of microvessel count, as compared with tumors from untreated mice or from mice treated with a single AS MBO. These data suggest that combinations of AS oligonucleotides directed against different growth factors might represent a novel, experimental therapy approach of colon carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2312829076,"The mechanism behind hormone dependent growth of breast cancer is presently not well understood. We show that the HES-1 protein level in the breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF-7 is down regulated by 17β-estradiol treatment. This regulation could be reversed by addition of the anti-estrogens 4OH tamoxifen, raloxifen and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) 182,780. In T47D cells with inducible exogenous HES-1 expression, induced expression of HES-1 protein prevented the proliferative effect of 17β-estradiol and subsequent up regulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). An inverse correlation between the HES-1 and PCNA protein levels respectively was found in colon cancer cell lines. These findings point to a potential role of HES-1 as a tumor suppressor in epithelial cells, and as a mediator of 17β-estradiols proliferative effect on breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2317119496,"H19 is a paternally imprinted gene whose expression produces a 2.4 kb RNA in most tissues during development and in mammalian myoblastic cell lines upon differentiation. Deletion of the active maternal allele of H19 and its flanking regions in the mouse leads to biallelic methylation and loss of imprinting of the neighbouring Igf2 gene. The function of H19 RNA remains unknown and, although polysome-associated, the absence of a conserved open reading frame suggests that it does not encode a protein product. We describe a novel post-transcriptional regulation of H19 gene expression which, in spite of this lack of coding capacity, is dependent on translational activity. We show that stabilization of the RNA is solely responsible for its accumulation during in vitro muscle cell differentiation. This conclusion is based on the finding that inhibition of protein synthesis results in a dramatic destabilization of H19 RNA in proliferating mouse C2C12 myoblastic cells but not in differentiated cells, and on run-on experiments which showed that the rate of transcription of H19 RNA remains constant during muscle cell differentiation. This mechanism could also be involved in H19 gene expression during mouse development in addition to its transcriptional activation which we have shown to occur."
https://openalex.org/W2313576448,"Effects of p53 expression on cell morphology and motility were studied using the derivatives of p53-null 10(1) mouse fibroblasts with tetracycline-regulated expression of exogenous human p53. Induction of p53 expression was accompanied by significant decrease in extracellular matrix (fibronectin) and reduction of matrix fibrils, diminution of the number and size of focal contacts, decrease of cell areas, establishment of more elongated cell shape and alterations of actin cytoskeleton (actin bundles became thinner, their number and size decreased). Expression of His175 and Gln22/Ser23 p53 mutants caused no such effects. To study the influence of p53 expression on cell motility we used wound technique and videomicroscopy observation of single living cells. It was found that induction of p53 expression led to increase of lamellar activity of cell edge. However, in spite of enhanced lamellar activity p53-expressing cells migrated to shorter distance and filled the narrow wound in longer time as compared with their p53-null counterparts. Possible mechanisms of the influence of p53 expression on cell morphology and motility are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2323083683,"IL-4 and IL-13 act on human lung fibroblasts through specific receptors differing in their composition. Indeed, the gammac chain is constitutively expressed in tumor lung myofibroblast but not in normal cells. Here, we have analysed the signal transduction induced by IL-4 and IL-13 in both cell types, in order to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor stromal development. The IL-4Ralpha chain is constitutively phosphorylated and pre-associated with the JAK1 protein in both cell types. In normal cells, we detected the activation of the classic IRS-2 or JAK1/STAT6 pathways, the phosphorylation of JAK2, while Tyk2 was constitutively phosphorylated and not modified by both cytokines. In addition to these pathways, in lung tumor myofibroblasts, IL-4 and IL-13 induced the phosphorylation of JAK3 and increased the phosphorylation of Tyk2. Interestingly, in both cell types IL-4 and IL-13 triggered an unusual pattern of STAT1 and STAT3 activation. These events probably correspond to a tissue-specific signaling important for the immunoregulatory functions of airways fibroblasts. Indeed, the inflammatory-like pattern of STATs signaling triggered by IL-4 and IL-13 in these cells may favor the homing of inflammatory and/or metastatic cells. In lung myofibroblasts, these properties could be modified through the different pattern of JAK activation."

https://openalex.org/W2117165121,"Myxoid and round-cell liposarcomas share the translocation t(12;16)(q13;p11) creating the TLS-CHOP fusion gene as a common genetic alteration. We previously reported several unique characteristics of genomic sequences around the breakpoints in the TLS and CHOP loci, and among them was the presence of consensus recognition motifs of Translin, a protein that associates with chromosomal translocations of lymphoid neoplasms. We further extended our search for Translin binding motifs in sequences adjacent to breakpoints and investigated whether Translin binds to these sequences in vitro by mobility-shift assay. Computer-assisted search found sequences highly homologous (>70%) with Translin binding motifs adjacent to the breakpoints in 10 out of 11 liposarcomas with the TLS-CHOP fusion genes. All of 13 oligonucleotides corresponding to the putative binding sequences in these cases bind to Hela cell extract and also recombinant Translin protein, although the binding affinity of each motif showed considerable differences. The DNA-protein complex formation was inhibited by non-labeled competitor or anti-Translin antibody, suggesting the specificity of the complex formation. Considering the high incidence and specific binding property, the presence of Translin binding motif may be one of the important determinants for the location of breakpoints in the TLS and CHOP genes in liposarcomas."

https://openalex.org/W2328043515,"Release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signals an increase in transcription of both the early response gene, c-fos, and the late response gene, grp78. We have used thapsigargin (TG), an ER calcium-ATPase pump inhibitor that induces calcium release from the ER, to investigate the possible involvement of c-Fos, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor, in grp78 induction. Two cell lines with markedly different responses to TG treatment were employed: the WEHI7.2 mouse lymphoma line in which TG fails to induce grp78, and the MDA-MB-468 mammary epithelial line in which TG induces grp78. In WEHI7.2 cells, TG-induced calcium release triggers a rapid increase in c-fos mRNA, but the level of c-Fos protein decreases due to degradation by the multicatalytic proteasome. C-FosdeltaC, a proteasome resistant c-Fos mutant with AP-1 activity similar to that of wild type c-Fos, restores grp78 induction in WEHI7.2 cells, detected by both Northern hybridization and a grp78 promoter-luciferase reporter assay. In MDA-MB-468 cells, TG-mediated calcium release induces a sustained elevation of c-Fos protein that precedes grp78 induction. A region of the grp78 promoter containing both ERSE and CORE regions, but missing TRE and CRE regions, is sufficient to mediate induction of reporter luciferase activity. Induction of this reporter was blocked by A-Fos, a dominant negative inhibitor of c-Fos. Also, the induction of grp78-luciferase reporter activity was inhibited by c-fos antisense mRNA. In summary, the findings indicate that c-Fos is involved in signaling grp78 induction following TG treatment, and that grp78 induction is inhibited by proteasome-mediated c-Fos degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2321563398,"v-Jun shares the ability of the Myc, E1A, and E2F oncogenes to both sustain cell cycle progression and promote apoptosis in the absence of mitogenic stimulation. To gain an insight into the mechanism of apoptosis sensitization, we examined the possible involvement of key regulatory proteins previously implicated in oncogene-induced cell death during v-Jun-induced apoptosis triggered by serum withdrawal. We observed that ectopic expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, or of two downstream effectors of growth factor signalling, v-PI 3-Kinase and v-Src, partially or completely suppressed apoptosis. Apoptosis was also observed in the presence of serum growth factors when endogenous PI3K activity was blocked using the synthetic inhibitor LY294002, further suggesting an important role for PI3-K in cell survival. Cytochrome C was released into the cytosol of apoptotic v-Jun expressing cells, and this release was inhibited by Bcl-2, suggesting an important role for mitochondrial dysfunction in v-Jun induced apoptosis. In contrast, inhibition of Fas signalling using dominant negative FADD did not inhibit apoptosis, nor was there any evidence for accumulation or activation of p53 in v-Jun transformed cells. Consistent with this latter observation, inhibition of p53 function by HPV16 E6 protein had no effect on v-Jun induced cell death. Taken together, these results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is an important component of the mechanism through which v-Jun sensitizes cells to apoptosis, but that the apoptotic signals elicited by v-Jun upstream of the mitochondria do not depend on increased levels of p53 activity or Fas signalling."
