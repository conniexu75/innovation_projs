https://openalex.org/W3037521276,"We report on the results of a measurement study carried out on a commuter bus in Dublin, Ireland using the Google/Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) API. This API is likely to be widely used by Covid-19 contact tracing apps. Measurements were collected between 60 pairs of handset locations and are publicly available. We find that the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API need not increase with distance between handsets, consistent with there being a complex radio environment inside a bus caused by the metal-rich environment. Changing the people holding a pair of handsets, with the location of the handsets otherwise remaining unchanged, can cause variations of +/-10dB in the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API. Applying the rule used by the Swiss Covid-19 contact tracing app to trigger an exposure notification to our bus measurements we find that no exposure notifications would have been triggered despite the fact that all pairs of handsets were within 2m of one another for at least 15 mins. Applying an alternative threshold-based exposure notification rule can somewhat improve performance to a detection rate of 5% when an exposure duration threshold of 15 minutes is used, increasing to 8% when the exposure duration threshold is reduced to 10 mins. Stratifying the data by distance between pairs of handsets indicates that there is only a weak dependence of detection rate on distance."
https://openalex.org/W3157754364,"The emergence of the novel coronavirus and then pandemic outbreak was coined 2019- nCoV or COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019). This disease has a mortality rate of about 3·7 percent, and successful therapy is desperately needed to combat it. The exact cellular mechanisms of COVID-19 need to be illustrated in detail. This study aimed to evaluate serum cytokines in COVID-19 patients. In this study, serum was collected from volunteer individuals, moderate COVID-19 patients, severe cases of COVID-19 patients, and patients who recovered from COVID-19 (n = 122). The serum concentrations of interleukins such as IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The concentrations of IL-1 and TNF-α were did not differ significantly among groups. However, the concentration of IL-6 was significantly higher in moderate COVID-19 and severe cases of COVID-19 groups compared to control and recovered groups indicating it to be an independent predictor in the coronavirus disease. The levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 were significantly lower in the recovery group than the severe case of the COVID-19 group. In contrast, the level of IL-10 in recovered COVID-19 patients was significantly higher in compare to severe cases, COVID-19 patients. Varying levels of cytokines were detected in COVID-19 group than control group suggesting distinct immunoregulatory mechanisms involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis. However, additional investigations are needed to be to be performed to understand the exact cellular mechanism of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W3159012474,"Background Negative lifestyle behaviors are associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes from coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study aimed to assess lifestyle changes affecting weight, sleep, mental health, physical activity, and dietary habits prospectively from before COVID-19 to during lockdown. Methods A total of 297 Saudi women, aged 19–30 years (mean age, 20.7 ± 1.4 years), were interviewed at two time points, before and during the quarantine. The data collected included anthropometrics, sociodemographic data, clinical history, food frequency questionnaire responses, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores, Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) responses, and Perceived Stress Scale measures. In addition, during quarantine, COVID-19 and nutrition-related information and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores were collected. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the indicators of weight gain and loss from before COVID-19 (baseline) until during lockdown. Results Although approximately half of the participants did not report a weight change, 30% revealed weight loss and 18%, weight gain. The variables associated with increased weight gain were self-quarantine since COVID-19 started (OR: 5.17, 95% CI: 1.57–17.01, p = 0.007), age (OR: 1.53, 1.03–2.28, p = 0.04), and stress at baseline and during lockdown (OR: 1.15, 1.03–1.29, p = 0.01; OR: 1.10, 1.01–1.19, p = 0.03, respectively). The variables associated with a reduced risk of weight gain were the GPAQ score during lockdown (OR: 0.16, 0.04–0.66, p = 0.01), coffee consumption (OR: 0.36, 0.19–0.67, p = 0.01), and total sleep time (OR: 0.70, 0.51–0.97, p = 0.03). Conclusion While most young Saudi women experienced no weight change during the COVID-19 lockdown, one-third lost weight and a significant proportion gained weight. Factors associated with weight, such as stress, sleep hours, physical activity, and coffee consumption, highlight the need to carefully consider those at risk during future circumstances that may require lockdowns. These factors could also aid in implementing policies for future lockdowns and support those most at risk of gaining weight."
https://openalex.org/W3158128220,"Background Risk communication is a key component of public health interventions during an outbreak. As the coronavirus pandemic unfolded in late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was at the forefront in the development of risk communication strategies. The WHO introduced a range of activities with the purpose of enabling the public to avail verified and timely information on COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Given the various WHO activities to protect the public health during COVID-19, it is important to investigate the extent of familiarity and uptake of the WHO recommendations among the public during the first wave of the pandemic. Methods To do this, we conducted a large-scale Pan-European survey covering around 7500 individuals that are representative of populations from seven European countries, collected online during April 2-April 15, 2020. We use descriptive statistics including proportions and correlations and graphical representations such as bar charts to analyze and display the data. Results Our findings suggest that information from the WHO in the context of COVID-19 is well trusted and acted upon by the public. Overall familiarity and adherence were quite high in most countries. Adherence was higher for social distancing recommendations compared to hygiene measures. Familiarity and adherence were higher among older, female, and highly educated respondents. However, country level heterogeneities were observed in the level of trust in information from the WHO, with countries severely affected by the pandemic reporting lower levels of trust. Conclusion Our findings call for efforts from health authorities to get regular feedback from the public on their familiarity and compliance with recommendations for preventive measures at all stages of the pandemic, to further develop and adapt risk communication as the pandemic evolves."

Unusual findings include frequent suspicion of bacterial translocations originating from the digestive tract as well as bacterial persistence in the lungs despite adequate therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3158570693,"Background Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to rage worldwide, clinical and laboratory studies of this disease have been limited in many countries. We investigated the epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory findings of COVID-19 infected patients to identify the effective indicators correlated with the disease. Methods A retrospective study was conducted at King Abdullah Hospital in Bisha Province, Saudi Arabia, from March 20 to June 30, 2020. Patients of different age groups were confirmed as having COVID-19 infection using a real-time polymerase chain reaction. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of the patients were statistically analyzed. Results Of the 132 patients, 85 were male and 47 were female, with a mean age of 50.9 years (SD±16.7). The patients were elderly (n = 29) and adults (n = 103). Of these, 54 (40.9%) had comorbidities, (25%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 12 (9.1%) died. On admission, the main clinical manifestations were fever (84.1%), cough (64.4%), shortness of breath (25%), chest pain (20.5%), and fatigue (18.2%). In all patients, increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes were observed. Patients’ lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated. C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated in 48.5%, D-dimer in 43.2%, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in 40.9% of patients. The elderly showed higher neutrophil (p = 0.011) and lower lymphocyte (p = 0.009) counts than adults. Glucose, creatine kinase-MB, LDH, bilirubin, D-dimer, and ESR were significantly higher in the elderly than in the adults. The COVID-19 death group had a higher leucocyte count (p = 0.036), and higher urea (p = 0.029) and potassium (p = 0.022) than the recovered group but had a lower hemoglobin concentration (p = 0.018). A significant association was determined between COVID-19 death and the presence of cardiovascular disease (χ2(1) = 16.297, p&lt;0.001), hypertension (χ2(1) = 12.034, p = 0.001), renal failure (χ2(1) = 3.843, p = 0. 05), old age (t (130) = 4.9, p &lt;0.001), and ICU admission (χ2(1) = 17.6 (1), p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Investigating some of the laboratory and clinical parameters could help assess the disease progression, risk of mortality, and follow up patients who could progress to a fatal condition."
https://openalex.org/W3158149342,"Alfalfa ( Medicago sativa L.) is an important legume crop for forage, agriculture, and environment in the world. Ascorbic acid (AsA) plays positive roles in plants. However, its effects on germination and salt-tolerance of alfalfa are unknown. The effects of AsA applications on seed germination and seedling salt-tolerance of alfalfa were investigated. The results revealed that 0.1 and 1 mmol L -1 of exogenous AsA increased germination, amylase, and protease, as well as seedling length, fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), and endogenous AsA both in the shoots and roots, except that 1 mmol L -1 AsA reduced the activities of α-amylase, β-amylase and protease on day 3. However, 10 and 100 mmol L -1 AsA inhibited these parameters and even caused serious rot. It indicates that 0.1 mmol L -1 AsA has the optimal effects, whereas 100 mmol L -1 AsA has the worst impacts. Another part of the results showed that 0.1 mmol L -1 AsA not only enhanced stem elongation, FW and DW, but also increased chlorophyll and carotenoids both under non-stress and 150 mmol L -1 NaCl stress. Furthermore, 0.1 mmol L -1 AsA mitigated the damages of membrane permeability, malondialdehyde, and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ions both in the shoots and roots under 150 mmol L -1 NaCl stress. Hence, 0.1 mmol L -1 AsA improves growth and induces salt-tolerance by inhibiting excessive ROS, down-regulating the ion toxicity and up-regulating the antioxidant system. The principal component analysis included two main components both in the shoots and roots, and it explained the results well. In summary, the optimum concentration of 0.1 mmol L -1 AsA can be implemented to improve the seed germination and seedling growth of alfalfa under salt stress."
https://openalex.org/W3158607448,"We present a novel, hardware-agnostic implementation strategy for lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations, which yields massive performance on homogeneous and heterogeneous many-core platforms. Based solely on C++17 Parallel Algorithms, our approach does not rely on any language extensions, external libraries, vendor-specific code annotations, or pre-compilation steps. Thanks in particular to a recently proposed GPU back-end to C++17 Parallel Algorithms, it is shown that a single code can compile and reach state-of-the-art performance on both many-core CPU and GPU environments for the solution of a given non trivial fluid dynamics problem. The proposed strategy is tested with six different, commonly used implementation schemes to test the performance impact of memory access patterns on different platforms. Nine different LB collision models are included in the tests and exhibit good performance, demonstrating the versatility of our parallel approach. This work shows that it is less than ever necessary to draw a distinction between research and production software, as a concise and generic LB implementation yields performances comparable to those achievable in a hardware specific programming language. The results also highlight the gains of performance achieved by modern many-core CPUs and their apparent capability to narrow the gap with the traditionally massively faster GPU platforms. All code is made available to the community in form of the open-source project ""stlbm"", which serves both as a stand-alone simulation software and as a collection of reusable patterns for the acceleration of pre-existing LB codes."
https://openalex.org/W3159606333,"With the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 globally, more than 40,000 healthcare staff rushed to Wuhan, Hubei Province to fight against this threatening disease. All staff had to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) for several hours when caring for patients, which resulted in adverse skin reactions and injuries. In this study, we used an online questionnaire to collect the self-reported skin damages among the first-line medical staff in the epidemic. The questionnaire was designed by four front-line wound care nurses and then revised through Delphi consultants. Items mainly focused on the adverse skin reactions and preventive strategies. The survey was distributed through phone application from March 15 th to March 20 th and received 275 responses in total. The prevalence of skin reactions (212, 77.09%) was high in both head and hands. The common clinical symptoms of skin reactions were redness, device-like mark, and burning pain in face; and dryness, dermatitis, and itch/irritation in hands. Three risk factors included gender, level of protection, and daily wearing time of PPE were identified that caused skin reactions among medical staff. 150 of 275 (54.55%) participants took preventive strategies like prophylactic dressings, however, more than 75% users had little knowledge about dressings. We suggest the frontline staff strengthened the protection of skin integrity and reduced the prevalence of adverse skin reactions after professional education."
https://openalex.org/W3157407611,"Insects are frequently infected with heritable bacterial endosymbionts. Endosymbionts have a dramatic impact on their host physiology and evolution. Their tissue distribution is variable with some species being housed intracellularly, some extracellularly and some having a mixed lifestyle. The impact of extracellular endosymbionts on the biofluids they colonize ( e . g . insect hemolymph) is however difficult to appreciate because biofluid composition can depend on the contribution of numerous tissues. Here we investigate Drosophila hemolymph proteome changes in response to the infection with the endosymbiont Spiroplasma poulsonii . S . poulsonii inhabits the fly hemolymph and gets vertically transmitted over generations by hijacking the oogenesis in females. Using dual proteomics on infected hemolymph, we uncovered a weak, chronic activation of the Toll immune pathway by S . poulsonii that was previously undetected by transcriptomics-based approaches. Using Drosophila genetics, we also identified candidate proteins putatively involved in controlling S . poulsonii growth. Last, we also provide a deep proteome of S . poulsonii , which, in combination with previously published transcriptomics data, improves our understanding of the post-transcriptional regulations operating in this bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W3040593374,"Here we present our Python toolbox “MR. Estimator” to reliably estimate the intrinsic timescale from electrophysiologal recordings of heavily subsampled systems. Originally intended for the analysis of time series from neuronal spiking activity, our toolbox is applicable to a wide range of systems where subsampling—the difficulty to observe the whole system in full detail—limits our capability to record. Applications range from epidemic spreading to any system that can be represented by an autoregressive process. In the context of neuroscience, the intrinsic timescale can be thought of as the duration over which any perturbation reverberates within the network; it has been used as a key observable to investigate a functional hierarchy across the primate cortex and serves as a measure of working memory. It is also a proxy for the distance to criticality and quantifies a system’s dynamic working point."
https://openalex.org/W3158423879,"Streptococcus pyogenes or group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a leading cause of bacterial pharyngitis, skin and soft tissue infections, life-threatening invasive infections, and the post-infectious autoimmune syndromes of acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Genetic manipulation of this important pathogen is complicated by resistance of the organism to genetic transformation. Very low transformation efficiency is attributed to recognition and degradation of introduced foreign DNA by a type I restriction-modification system encoded by the hsdRSM locus. DNA sequence analysis of this locus in ten GAS strains that had been previously transformed with an unrelated plasmid revealed that six of the ten harbored a spontaneous mutation in hsdR , S , or M . The mutations were all different, and at least five of the six were predicted to result in loss of function of the respective hsd gene product. The unexpected occurrence of such mutations in previously transformed isolates suggested that the process of transformation selects for spontaneous inactivating mutations in the Hsd system. We investigated the possibility of exploiting the increased transformability of hsd mutants by constructing a deletion mutation in hsdM in GAS strain 854, a clinical isolate representative of the globally dominant M1T1 clonal group. Mutant strain 854Δ hsdM exhibited a 5-fold increase in electrotransformation efficiency compared to the wild type parent strain and no obvious change in growth or off-target gene expression. We conclude that genetic transformation of GAS selects for spontaneous mutants in the hsdRSM restriction modification system. We propose that use of a defined hsdM mutant as a parent strain for genetic manipulation of GAS will enhance transformation efficiency and reduce the likelihood of selecting spontaneous hsd mutants with uncharacterized genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3157983547,"Background Transition readiness refers to a client who knows about his/her illness and oriented towards future goals and hopes, shows skills needed to negotiate healthcare, and can assume responsibility for his/ her treatment, and participate in decision-making that ensures uninterrupted care during and after the care transition to adult HIV care. There is a paucity of research on effective transition strategies. This study explored factors associated with adolescent readiness for the transition into adult care in Uganda. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 786 adolescents, and young people living with HIV randomly selected from 9 antiretroviral therapy clinics, utilizing a structured questionnaire. The readiness level was determined using a pre-existing scale from the Ministry of Health, and adolescents were categorized as ready or not ready for the transition. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Results A total of 786 adolescents were included in this study. The mean age of participants was 17.48 years (SD = 4). The majority of the participants, 484 (61.6%), were females. Most of the participants, 363 (46.2%), had no education. The majority of the participants, 549 (69.8%), were on first-line treatment. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that readiness to transition into adult care remained significantly associated with having acquired a tertiary education (AOR 4.535, 95% CI 1.243–16.546, P = 0.022), trusting peer educators for HIV treatment (AOR 16.222, 95% CI 1.835–143.412, P = 0.012), having received counselling on transition to adult services (AOR 2.349, 95% CI 1.004–5.495, P = 0.049), having visited an adult clinic to prepare for transition (AOR 6.616, 95% CI 2.435–17.987, P = &lt; 0.001) and being satisfied with the transition process in general (AOR 0.213, 95% CI 0.069–0.658, P = 0.007). Conclusion The perceived readiness to transition care among young adults was low. A series of individual, social and health system and services factors may determine successful transition readiness among adolescents in Uganda. Transition readiness may be enhanced by strengthening the implementation of age-appropriate and individualized case management transition at all sites while creating supportive family, peer, and healthcare environments."
https://openalex.org/W3158222044,"Ubiquitination is a dynamic and reversible process of a specific modification of target proteins catalyzed by a series of ubiquitination enzymes. Because of the extensive range of substrates, ubiquitination plays a crucial role in the localization, metabolism, regulation, and degradation of proteins. Although the treatment of glioma has been improved, the survival rate of patients is still not satisfactory. Therefore, we explore the role of ubiquitin proteasome in glioma. Survival-related ubiquitination related genes (URGs) were obtained through analysis of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Cox analysis was performed to construct risk model. The accuracy of risk model is verified by survival, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Cox analysis. We obtained 36 differentially expressed URGs and found that 25 URGs were related to patient prognosis. We used the 25 URGs to construct a model containing 8 URGs to predict glioma patient risk by Cox analysis. ROC showed that the accuracy rate of this model is 85.3%. Cox analysis found that this model can be used as an independent prognostic factor. We also found that this model is related to molecular typing markers. Patients in the high-risk group were enriched in multiple tumor-related signaling pathways. In addition, we predicted TFs that may regulate the risk model URGs and found that the risk model is related to B cells, CD4 T cells, and neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W3159560895,"Determining sensitive drugs for a patient is one of the most critical problems in precision medicine. Using genomic profiles of the tumor and drug information can help in tailoring the most efficient treatment for a patient. In this paper, we proposed a classification machine learning approach that predicts the sensitive/resistant drugs for a cell line. It can be performed by using both drug and cell line similarities, one of the cell line or drug similarities, or even not using any similarity information. This paper investigates the influence of using previously defined as well as two newly introduced similarities on predicting anti-cancer drug sensitivity. The proposed method uses max concentration thresholds for assigning drug responses to class labels. Its performance was evaluated using stratified five-fold cross-validation on cell line-drug pairs in two datasets. Assessing the predictive powers of the proposed model and three sets of methods, including state-of-the-art classification methods, state-of-the-art regression methods, and off-the-shelf classification machine learning approaches shows that the proposed method outperforms other methods. Moreover, The efficiency of the model is evaluated in tissue-specific conditions. Besides, the novel sensitive associations predicted by this model were verified by several supportive evidence in the literature and reliable database. Therefore, the proposed model can efficiently be used in predicting anti-cancer drug sensitivity. Material and implementation are available at https://github.com/fahmadimoughari/CDSML ."
https://openalex.org/W3159816676,"The bean fly ( Ophiomyia spp) is a key insect pest causing significant crop damage and yield loss in common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L., 2n = 2x = 22). Development and deployment of agronomic superior and bean fly resistant common bean varieties aredependent on genetic variation and the identification of genes and genomic regions controlling economic traits. This study’s objective was to determine the population structure of a diverse panel of common bean genotypes and deduce associations between bean fly resistance and agronomic traits based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Ninety-nine common bean genotypes were phenotyped in two seasons at two locations and genotyped with 16 565 SNP markers. The genotypes exhibited significant variation for bean fly damage severity (BDS), plant mortality rate (PMR), and pupa count (PC). Likewise, the genotypes showed significant variation for agro-morphological traits such as days to flowering (DTF), days to maturity (DTM), number of pods per plant (NPP), number of seeds per pod (NSP), and grain yield (GYD). The genotypes were delineated into two populations, which were based on the Andean and Mesoamerican gene pools. The genotypes exhibited a minimum membership coefficient of 0.60 to their respective populations. Eighty-three significant (P&lt;0.01) markers were identified with an average linkage disequilibrium of 0.20 at 12Mb across the 11 chromosomes. Three markers were identified, each having pleiotropic effects on two traits: M100049197 (BDS and NPP), M3379537 (DTF and PC), and M13122571 (NPP and GYD). The identified markers are useful for marker-assisted selection in the breeding program to develop common bean genotypes with resistance to bean fly damage."

https://openalex.org/W3158785191,"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a locally aggressive neoplasm characterized by mutations in the CTNNB1 gene, which encodes the β-catenin protein. We reviewed 85 cases of DF and performed Sanger sequencing for detecting mutations in CTNNB1 and immunostaining for detecting β-catenin localization. We included 70 DF samples, of which 56 cases demonstrated nuclear β-catenin localization and 43 cases harboured CTNNB1 mutations. CTNNB1- mutant DF samples consistently displayed nuclear β-catenin expression and were derived from larger-sized tumours compared to samples with wild-type CTNNB1 . When we further classified DF cases into 2 subgroups based on the type of specimen, excised specimens with nuclear β-catenin expression frequently displayed CTNNB1 mutation and no statistical correlation between nuclear β-catenin expression and CTNNB1 mutation was observed in biopsies. When we classified CTNNB1 mutation cases into 2 subgroups (DF with T41A or T41I, and DF with S45F or S45P), T41A or T41I mutations were observed more frequently in males than in females. Additionally, DF tumours harbouring S45F or S45P mutations were located more frequently in the abdominal wall than tumours with T41A or T41I mutations. In conclusion, CTNNB1 mutation correlates with nuclear β-catenin expression in larger or excised DF tumours, and DF harbouring CTNNB1 mutations manifest variable clinical presentations."
https://openalex.org/W3159094452,"Organic acids and sugars are the primary components that determine the quality and flavor of loquat fruits. In the present study, major organic acids, sugar content, enzyme activities, and the expression of related genes were analyzed during fruit development in two loquat cultivars, ’JieFangZhong’ (JFZ) and ’BaiLi’ (BL). Our results showed that the sugar content increased during fruit development in the two cultivars; however, the organic acid content dramatically decreased in the later stages of fruit development. The differences in organic acid and sugar content between the two cultivars primarily occured in the late stage of fruit development and the related enzymes showed dynamic changes in activies during development. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and mNAD malic dehydrogenase (mNAD-MDH) showed higher activities in JFZ at 95 days after flowering (DAF) than in BL. However, NADP-dependent malic enzyme (NADP-ME) activity was the lowest at 95 DAF in both JFZ and BL with BL showing higher activity compared with JFZ. At 125 DAF, the activity of fructokinase (FRK) was significantly higher in JFZ than in BL. The activity of sucrose synthase (SUSY) in the sucrose cleavage direction (SS-C) was low at early stages of fruit development and increased at 125 DAF. SS-C activity was higher in JFZ than in BL. vAI and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activities were similar in the two both cultivars and increased with fruit development. RNA-sequencing was performed to determine the candidate genes for organic acid and sugar metabolism. Our results showed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with the greated fold changes in the later stages of fruit development between the two cultivars were phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 2 ( PEPC2 ), mNAD-malate dehydrogenase ( mNAD-MDH ), cytosolic NADP-ME ( cyNADP-ME2 ), aluminum-activated malate transporter ( ALMT9 ), subunit A of vacuolar H + -ATPase ( VHA-A ), vacuolar H + -PPase ( VHP1 ), NAD-sorbitol dehydrogenase ( NAD-SDH ), fructokinase ( FK ), sucrose synthase in sucrose cleavage ( SS-C ), sucrose-phosphate synthase 1 ( SPS1) , neutral invertase (NI), and vacuolar acid invertase ( vAI) . The expression of 12 key DEGs was validated by quantitative reverese transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Our findings will help understand the molecular mechanism of organic acid and sugar formation in loquat, which will aid in breeding high-quality loquat cultivars."

However, little is known on the association between obesity and iron deficiency in Qatar. This study aimed to investigate the link between abdominal obesity indices and iron status among adults in Qatar. A random sample of 1000 healthy Qatari adults, aged 20-50 years, was obtained from Qatar Biobank study. Body weight, waist circumference, dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) parameters and iron status indicators were measured using standard techniques. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the associations. The prevalence of iron deficiency and anaemia were 35.4 and 25%, respectively. Of the participants with a large waist circumference, 31.7% had anaemia. Ferritin significantly increased with the increase in the android fat to gynoid fat ratio and visceral fat in both genders. Serum iron and transferring saturation decreased significantly with the increase in waist circumference in women. In both genders, C-reactive protein increased with the increase in all obesity indices. Standardized values of waist circumference, android fat, gynoid fat ratio and visceral fat were significantly associated with log transformed ferritin in men and women. Waist circumference was inversely related to serum iron (β:-0.95, 95% CI:-1.50,-0.39) and transferrin saturation (β:-1.45, 95%CI:-2.46, -0.43) in women. In men, waist circumference was positively associated with haemoglobin level (β: 0.16, 95% CI:0.04, 0.29). Central obesity coexists with anaemia among the study population. Elevated central obesity indices were associated with an increase in ferritin concentration. The increased ferritin concentration may be attributed to the increase in inflammatory status as a result of an increase in c-reactive protein concentration associated with central obesity."

Recent studies show Netrin-4 expressed in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord is associated with chronic pain. Here we found involvement of Netrin-4 in neuropathic pain in the maxillofacial region. Netrin-4, along with one of its receptors, Unc5B, are expressed in the caudal subnucleus of the trigeminal spinal tract nucleus. Inhibition of its binding by anti-Netrin-4 antibodies not only shows a behavioral analgesic effect but also neuronal activity suppression. There was increased Netrin-4 expression at 14 days after infraorbital nerve injury. Our findings suggest that Netrin-4 induced by peripheral nerve injury causes neuropathic pain via Unc5B."
https://openalex.org/W3158249183,"Objective Clinicians and healthcare organizations are ethically obligated to treat patients with respect, yet it is not clear what actions best demonstrate respect to patients. This exploratory qualitative study aimed to understand what actions on both an individual and organizational level effectively demonstrate respect for primary care patients. Methods We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with primary care patients in an integrated healthcare delivery system in Oregon and an integrated safety net health system in Colorado who were participating in a genomics implementation research study of a hereditary cancer screening program. We systematically coded interview transcripts using a coding framework developed based on iterative review of the interview guide and transcripts. We further analyzed the data coded with sub-codes relating to patients’ experiences with respect in healthcare using a descriptive content analysis approach. Results We interviewed 40 English-speaking (n = 30, 75%) and Spanish-speaking (n = 10, 25%) patients. Most interviewees identified as female (n = 35, 88%) and either Hispanic/Latino(a) (n = 17, 43%) or White or European American (n = 15, 38%). Interviewees identified two categories of efforts by individual clinicians that demonstrate respect: engaging with patients and being transparent. They identified five efforts by healthcare organizations: promoting safety and inclusivity, protecting patient privacy, communicating about scheduling, navigating financial barriers to care, and ensuring continuity of care. Conclusions Our findings suggest that patients’ experiences of respect depend on efforts by individual clinicians as well as healthcare organizations. Our findings offer insight into how clinicians can build stronger partnerships with patients and how organizations can seek to promote access to care and patient safety and comfort. They also illustrate areas for future research and quality improvement to more effectively respect patients."
https://openalex.org/W3158398933,"Previous studies have identified frequent comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders and conditions in adults with thyrotoxicosis. These studies are scarce or even lacking in pediatric population. This work aimed to study the behavior of children and adolescents with Graves’ disease (GD). This study included 35 children with GD (boys = 15; girls = 25; mean age: 11.45±1.50yrs) and 40 healthy children (boys = 20; girls = 20; mean age: 12.54±1.62yrs). Behavior was assessed using Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Children with GD were assessed during periods of thyroid hormone elevation (active disease) and normalized thyroid hormones (with anti-thyroid drugs or ATDs). Compared to healthy children, patients during periods of thyroid hormone elevation (74.29%) and normalized thyroid hormones (31.43%) had higher frequencies of behavioral abnormalities and scorings of total CBCL scale (P = 0.01; P = 0.04, respectively) and its subscales’ [Anxious/Depressed (P = 0.02; P = 0.04), Withdrawn/Depressed (P = 0.03; P = 0.04) and Somatic Complaints (P = 0.03; P = 0.127) and Social (P = 0.01; P = 0.225), Thought (P = 0.01; P = 0.128) and Attention (P = 0.01; P = 0.01) problems], indicating internalizing and externalizing problems. The majority of patients had at least two different behavioral problems. Marked improvement was found during period of normalized thyroid hormones (P = 0.001). Correlation analyses showed significant associations between total CBCL scoring and age at onset (P = 0.01; P = 0.001) and lower concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (P = 0.001; P = 0.04) and higher concentrations of free thyroxine (fT4) (P = 0.01; P = 0.02), triiodothyronine (fT3) (P = 0.01; P = 0.03) and thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAbs) (P = 0.001; P = 0.01) during periods of thyroid hormone elevation and normalized thyroid hormones, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that ""at presentation"" lower concentrations of TSH (P = 0.001; P = 0.03) and higher concentrations of fT4 (P = 0.001, P = 0.01), fT3 (P = 0.01; P = 0.06) and TRAbs (P = 0.001; P = 0.001) were predictors of behavioral problems during periods of active disease and normalized thyroid hormones. We conclude that GD is associated with higher frequencies and severities of anxiety, depression and inattention during periods of thyroid hormone elevation as well as normalized thyroid hormones with ATDs. Therefore, early diagnosis and optimizing management are required to improve children’s social life."
https://openalex.org/W3158838946,"The 20-question Revised Study Process Questionnaire (R-SPQ-2F), which is frequently used to categorize student learning approaches as either deep or surface , was administered to three sections of Anatomy &amp; Physiology (A&amp;P) courses at a highest research university in the southeastern United States as part of a larger research project. Two hundred thirty-one (231) respondents completed the full survey and 11 participants were recruited to a comparative case study. Initial review of interview transcripts raised concerns about the validity of the R-SPQ-2F results with the population of interest. Interview transcripts were coded using a priori codes corresponding to the R-SPQ-2F items, and qualitative and quantitative results were then triangulated. Additional survey responses were collected in a subsequent semester and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed using the complete responses from 381 students. The CFA yielded similar or better measures of reliability and fit to the two-factor structure as those in previously reported work by other authors. Nonetheless, findings from triangulation suggest that the R-SPQ-2F was not able to group students by deep and surface approaches to learning in the context of an undergraduate A&amp;P course. In addition, six interviews (3 deep, 3 surface) demonstrated a new theme of surface leading to deep with participants indicating that memorization was necessary for the purpose of gaining a full understanding of the course material. This mixed method analysis calls into question whether the results are valid for separating student approaches into the previously published descriptions of deep and surface approaches. The finding of the surface leading to deep orientation, which may align with previous descriptions of an achieving approach, has significant implications for both research and instruction, as memorizing and other “surface” strategies are often minimized and discouraged, yet are an important step in student learning."
https://openalex.org/W3159065712,"Background For many years, discussions about health care for people with disabilities (PwD) in Brazil have not been treated as a priority; however, based on the advances made at the beginning of this century, new policies have been developed with the aim of improving access of these people to health services. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze how individual characteristics and contextual indicators are associated with access to rehabilitation services for PwD in Brazil. Methods A multivariate analysis was performed based on data from the National Health Survey 2013, considering access to rehabilitation services by PwD as the primary outcome and individual and contextual factors selected from Andersen’s behavioral model as independent variables. The contextual variables were reduced to two composite indicators (1-primary health care coverage and unfavorable socioeconomic conditions, and 2-economic inequality) from the analysis of the principal components. Poisson regression analysis with robust variance was performed to estimate the prevalence ratio (PR) and the respective 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Results Access to rehabilitation services by PwD was more prevalent in people aged 0 to 17 years (PR = 3.28; 95%CI 2.85–3.78), who are illiterate (PR = 1.24; 95%CI 1.09–1.40), whose socioeconomic level is A or B (PR = 1.60; 95%CI 1.35–1.88), who have health insurance (PR = 1.31; 95%CI 1.15–1.49), who have severe limitations (PR = 3.09; 95%CI 2.64–3.62), who live in states with a good offer of Specialized Rehabilitation Centers, both type II (PR = 1.20; CI95% 1.08; 1.33) and type IV (PR = 1.29; CI95% 1.15; 1.44), and who have greater coverage of primary health care, but unfavorable socioeconomic conditions (PR = 1.15; CI95% 1.03–1.28). Conclusion The results clarify the social inequities that exist regarding access to rehabilitation services for PwD in Brazil and highlight the need to formulate and implement public policies that guarantee the realization of the rights of these people."
https://openalex.org/W3159233443,"Cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.) is considered as the most valuable cash crop of Pakistan. During last decade, its yield has been declined due to various biotic and abiotic factors. Among abiotic factors, improper use of fertilizers is considered very important specially regarding plant defense and yield. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of different levels (0, 40, 80 and 120 kg ha -1 ) of K fertilizer (K 2 O) on different growth parameters of two commercial Bt cotton cultivars (CYTO-301 and IUB-2013) and one non-Bt cultivar (CYTO-142) during 2016 and 2017. Maximum plant height (124–134 cm), dry matter contents (915–1005%), fruiting point (441–462), bolls per plant (96–139), average boll weight (4.2–5.2 g) and seed cotton yield (2524–3175 kg ha -1 ) and minimum shedding (43–73%) were observed in plots receiving highest dose of K (120 kg ha -1 ). The CYTO-103 cultivar was found more responsive to K fertilizer as compared to rest of cultivars (CYTO-142 and IUB-2013). Concluding, ideal dose of fertilizer is very important (120 kg ha -1 in our case) for optimum growth and production of good quality fiber with enhanced seed cotton yield."
https://openalex.org/W3159862376,"Driving under the influence (DUI) increases the risk of crashes. Emerging technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), represent potentially powerful and attractive tools for the prevention of risky behaviours, such as DUI. Therefore, they are embraced in prevention efforts with VR interventions primed to grow in popularity in near future. However, little is known about the actual effectiveness of such DUI-targeting VR interventions. To help fill the knowledge gap, this study explored the effects of one VR intervention as delivered in the real world. Using pre and post test design, including an intervention group (n = 98) and a control group (n = 39), the intervention evaluation examined young drivers’ (aged 18 to 25, no known history of DUI) intention and self-reported behaviour three months after the intervention as compared to the baseline. The results did not provide evidence for statistically significant effects of the VR intervention on self-reported DUI behaviour during the three months post intervention and DUI intention at three months post intervention. Such results might be due to the fact that the recruited participants generally self-reported little DUI behaviour, i.e. positively changing behaviour that is already positive is inherently challenging. Nevertheless, the results question the utility of funding the roll-out of arguably attractive technologies without a thorough understanding of their effectiveness in particular settings. To improve the potential for future positive outcomes of such interventions, we provide suggestions on how VR software might be further developed and, subsequently, leveraged in future research to improve the likelihood for behavioural change, e.g. by collecting, analysing and presenting objective driving performance data. Alternatively, future endeavours might focus on participants with known DUI history and examine the effects of the VR intervention for this particular higher-risk group."

We conducted a cross-sectional study of 280 people aged ≥60 years served at public primary health care centers in Northeastern Brazil. Sociodemographic, oral discomfort and general health data were collected. The Lawton and Brody scale were used to assess IADL. This research adheres to the STROBE checklist. Most participants were married (n = 139; 49.6%), women (n = 182; 65.0%) and retired (n = 212; 75.7%). A total of 37 (13.2%) older adults had some degree of dependence in IADL. Dependence in IADL was associated with: retirement (p&lt;0.040), poor general health (p = 0.002), speech problems (p = 0.014), use of medications (p = 0.021), difficulty chewing and swallowing food (p = 0.011), voice changes (p = 0.044), edentulism (p = 0.011), use of toothbrush (p&lt;0.001), use of toothpaste (p&lt;0.001), and visit to the dentist in the previous year (p = 0.020). Functional disability was associated with older age, cardiovascular diseases, speech problems, chewing and swallowing difficulties, use of medication and brushing deficiency. The functional dependence in IADL can be considered an indicator of oral health status in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3158053187,"Multiple matrix metalloproteinases have significant roles in tissue organization during lung development, and repair. Imbalance of proteinases may lead to chronic inflammation, changes in tissue structure, and are also highly associated to cancer development. The role of MMP20 is not well studied in lung organogenesis, however, it was previously shown to be present at high level in lung adenocarcinoma. The current study aimed to identify the functional properties of MMP20 on cell proliferation and motility in a lung adenocarcinoma in vitro cell model, and relate the interaction of MMP20 with other molecular signalling pathways in the lung cells after gaining tumoral properties. In this study, two different single guide RNA (sgRNAs) that specifically targeted on MMP20 sites were transfected into human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells by using CRISPR-Cas method. Following that, the changes of PI3-K, survivin, and MAP-K mRNA gene expression were determined by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). The occurrence of cell death was also examined by Acridine Orange/Propidium Iodide double staining. Meanwhile, the motility of the transfected cells was evaluated by wound healing assay. All the data were compared with non-transfected cells as a control group. Our results demonstrated that the transfection of the individual sgRNAs significantly disrupted the proliferation of the A549 cell line through suppression in the gene expression of PI3-K, survivin, and MAP-K. When compared to non-transfected cells, both experimental cell groups showed reduction in the migration rate, as reflected by the wider gaps in the wound healing assay. The current study provided preliminary evidence that MMP20 could have regulatory role on stemness and proliferative genes in the lung tissues and affect the cell motility. It also supports the notion that targeting MMP20 could be a potential treatment mode for halting cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W3159009732,"Food insecurity correlates with poor physical and mental health in older individuals, but has not been studied in a laboratory animal model. This explorative study developed a laboratory mouse model for analyzing the impact of food insecurity on food consumption, stress coping mechanisms, exploratory behavior, and memory. 18-month-old CD-1 female mice were assigned to either the food insecurity exposure condition (31 mice, 8 cages) or the control condition (34 mice, 8 cages) by cage. Over four weeks, the mice that were exposed to food insecurity received varied, unpredictable portions of their baseline food consumption (50%, 75%, 125%, 150% of baseline) for four days, followed by ad libitum access for three days, to approximate the inconsistent access to food observed in households experiencing food insecurity. Behavioral tasks were conducted before and after food insecurity exposure. Mice in the food insecurity exposure condition ate less compared to control mice during food insecurity (two-way ANOVA: group x time interaction: F 7,93 = 10.95, P &lt; 0.01) but ate more when given access to high fat food (two-way ANOVA, group x time interaction: F 1,14 = 11.14, P &lt; 0.01). Mice exposed to food insecurity increased active escaping behaviors in the forced swim test (repeated measures two-way ANOVA, group x time interaction: F 1,63 = 5.40, P = 0.023). Exploratory behaviors were unaffected by food insecurity. Mice exposed to food insecurity showed a reduction in memory (repeated measures two-way ANOVA, group x time interaction: F 1,61 = 4.81, P = 0.037). These results suggest that exposure to food insecurity is associated with differences in food consumption patterns, active coping mechanisms, and memory. The behavioral changes associated with food insecurity may inform research on food insecurity’s impact on health in elderly humans."
https://openalex.org/W3159290821,"In the summer of 2017, an estimated 745,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh in what has been described as one of the largest and fastest growing refugee crises in the world. Among numerous health concerns, an outbreak of acute jaundice syndrome (AJS) was detected by the disease surveillance system in early 2018 among the refugee population. This paper describes the investigation into the increase in AJS cases, the process and results of the investigation, which were strongly suggestive of a large outbreak due to hepatitis A virus (HAV). An enhanced serological investigation was conducted between 28 February to 26 March 2018 to determine the etiologies and risk factors associated with the outbreak. A total of 275 samples were collected from 18 health facilities reporting AJS cases. Blood samples were collected from all patients fulfilling the study specific case definition and inclusion criteria, and tested for antibody responses using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Out of the 275 samples, 206 were positive for one of the agents tested. The laboratory results confirmed multiple etiologies including 154 (56%) samples tested positive for hepatitis A, 1 (0.4%) positive for hepatitis E, 36 (13%) positive for hepatitis B, 25 (9%) positive for hepatitis C, and 14 (5%) positive for leptospirosis. Among all specimens tested 24 (9%) showed evidence of co-infections with multiple etiologies. Hepatitis A and E are commonly found in refugee camps and have similar clinical presentations. In the absence of robust testing capacity when the epidemic was identified through syndromic reporting, a particular concern was that of a hepatitis E outbreak, for which immunity tends to be limited, and which may be particularly severe among pregnant women. This report highlights the challenges of identifying causative agents in such settings and the resources required to do so. Results from the month-long enhanced investigation did not point out widespread hepatitis E virus (HEV) transmission, but instead strongly suggested a large-scale hepatitis A outbreak of milder consequences, and highlighted a number of other concomitant causes of AJS (acute hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Leptospirosis), albeit most likely at sporadic level. Results strengthen the need for further water and sanitation interventions and are a stark reminder of the risk of other epidemics transmitted through similar routes in such settings, particularly dysentery and cholera. It also highlights the need to ensure clinical management capacity for potentially chronic conditions in this vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W3159118220,"Pooling (or combining) and analysing observational, longitudinal data at the individual level facilitates inference through increased sample sizes, allowing for joint estimation of study- and individual-level exposure variables, and better enabling the assessment of rare exposures and diseases. Empirical studies leveraging such methods when randomization is unethical or impractical have grown in the health sciences in recent years. The adoption of so-called ""causal"" methods to account for both/either measured and/or unmeasured confounders is an important addition to the methodological toolkit for understanding the distribution, progression, and consequences of infectious diseases (IDs) and interventions on IDs. In the face of the Covid-19 pandemic and in the absence of systematic randomization of exposures or interventions, the value of these methods is even more apparent. Yet to our knowledge, no studies have assessed how causal methods involving pooling individual-level, observational, longitudinal data are being applied in ID-related research. In this systematic review, we assess how these methods are used and reported in ID-related research over the last 10 years. Findings will facilitate evaluation of trends of causal methods for ID research and lead to concrete recommendations for how to apply these methods where gaps in methodological rigor are identified.We will apply MeSH and text terms to identify relevant studies from EBSCO (Academic Search Complete, Business Source Premier, CINAHL, EconLit with Full Text, PsychINFO), EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. Eligible studies are those that apply causal methods to account for confounding when assessing the effects of an intervention or exposure on an ID-related outcome using pooled, individual-level data from 2 or more longitudinal, observational studies.

It is an essential concept in many applications, including personalized pricing, auction and negotiation. While consumers will not volunteer their RPs, we may be able to predict these values, based on each consumer’s specific information, using a model learned from earlier consumer transactions. Here, we view each such (non)transaction as a censored observation , which motivates us to use techniques from survival analysis/prediction, to produce models that can generate a consumer-specific RP distribution, based on features of each new consumer. To validate this framework of RP, we run experiments on realistic data, with four survival prediction methods. These models performed very well (under three different criteria) on the task of estimating consumer-specific RP distributions, which shows that our RP framework can be effective."

There is need to develop post-trial care guidelines that are flexible and sensitive to local contexts and to the specific needs of different groups of participants, particularly in low income contexts. Evidence regarding HIV trial closure and post-trial care is required to underpin the development of appropriate policies in this area. This article reports research from Uganda that develops a new model of ‘Facilitated Transition’ to conceptualize the transition process of HIV positive trial participants from ‘research’ to ‘usual care’ health facilities after trial conclusion. This was a qualitative grounded theory study that included 21 adult HIV positive post-trial participants and 22 research staff, undertaken between October 2014 and August 2015. The findings showed that trial closure is a complex process for HIV positive participants which includes three phases: the pre-closure, trial-closure, and post-trial phases. The model highlights a range of different needs of research participants and suggests specific and person-centred interventions that can be delivered at different phases with the aim of improving health outcomes and experiences for trial participants in low income settings during trial closure. Further research needs to be done to verify the model in other contexts and for other conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3157484020,"The foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is able to survive across a wide range of intra- and extra-host environments by appropriately modulating gene expression patterns in response to different stimuli. Positive Regulatory Factor A (PrfA) is the major transcriptional regulator of virulence gene expression in L . monocytogenes . It has long been known that activated charcoal is required to induce the expression of PrfA-regulated genes in complex media, such as Brain Heart Infusion (BHI), but not in chemically defined media. In this study, we show that the expression of the PrfA-regulated hly , which encodes listeriolysin O, is induced 5- and 8-fold in L . monocytogenes cells grown in Chelex-treated BHI (Ch-BHI) and in the presence of activated charcoal (AC-BHI), respectively, relative to cells grown in BHI medium. Specifically, we show that metal ions present in BHI broth plays a role in the reduced expression of the PrfA regulon. In addition, we show that expression of hly is induced when the levels of bioavailable extra- or intercellular iron are reduced. L . monocytogenes cells grown Ch-BHI and AC-BHI media showed similar levels of resistance to the iron-activated antibiotic, streptonigrin, indicating that activated charcoal reduces the intracellular labile iron pool. Metal depletion and exogenously added glutathione contributed synergistically to PrfA-regulated gene expression since glutathione further increased hly expression in metal-depleted BHI but not in BHI medium. Analyses of transcriptional reporter fusion expression patterns revealed that genes in the PrfA regulon are differentially expressed in response to metal depletion, metal excess and exogenous glutathione. Our results suggest that metal ion abundance plays a role in modulating expression of PrfA-regulated virulence genes in L . monocytogenes ."
https://openalex.org/W3157895561,"To practically determine the effect of chloride (Cl) on the acid-base status, four approaches are currently used: accepted ranges of serum Cl values; Cl corrections; the serum Cl/Na ratio; and the serum Na-Cl difference. However, these approaches are governed by different concepts. Our aim is to investigate which approach to the evaluation of the effect of Cl is the best. In this retrospective cohort study, 2529 critically ill patients who were admitted to the tertiary care unit between 2011 and 2018 were retrospectively evaluated. The effects of Cl on the acid-base status according to each evaluative approach were validated by the standard base excess (SBE) and apparent strong ion difference (SID a ). To clearly demonstrate only the effects of Cl on the acid-base status, a subgroup that included patients with normal lactate, albumin and SIG values was created. To compare approaches, kappa and a linear regression model for all patients and Bland-Altman test for a subgroup were used. In both the entire cohort and the subgroup, correlations among BE Cl , SID a and SBE were stronger than those for other approaches (r = 0.94 r = 0.98 and r = 0.96 respectively). Only BECl had acceptable limits of agreement with SBE in the subgroup (bias: 0.5 mmol L-1) In the linear regression model, only BE Cl in all the Cl evaluation approaches was significantly related to the SBE. For the evaluation of the effect of chloride on the acid-base status, BE Cl is a better approach than accepted ranges of serum Cl values, Cl corrections and the Cl/Na ratio."
https://openalex.org/W3157988694,"The domestic Bactrian camel is a valuable livestock resource in arid desert areas. Therefore, it is essential to understand the roles of important genes responsible for its characteristics. We used restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to detect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in seven domestic Bactrian camel populations. In total, 482,786 SNPs were genotyped. The pool of all remaining others were selected as the reference population, and the Nanjiang, Sunite, Alashan, Dongjiang, Beijiang, Qinghai, and Hexi camels were the target populations for selection signature analysis. We obtained 603, 494, 622, 624, 444, 588, and 762 selected genes, respectively, from members of the seven target populations. Gene Ontology classifications and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed, and the functions of these genes were further studied using Genecards to identify genes potentially related to the unique characteristics of the camel population, such as heat resistance and stress resistance. Across all populations, cellular process, single-organism process, and metabolic process were the most abundant biological process subcategories, whereas cell, cell part, and organelle were the most abundant cellular component subcategories. Binding and catalytic activity represented the main molecular functions. The selected genes in Alashan camels were mainly enriched in ubiquitin mediated proteolysis pathways, the selected genes in Beijiang camels were mainly enriched in MAPK signaling pathways, the selected genes in Dongjiang camels were mainly enriched in RNA transport pathways, the selected genes in Hexi camels were mainly enriched in endocytosis pathways, the selected genes in Nanjiang camels were mainly enriched in insulin signaling pathways, while the selected genes in Qinghai camels were mainly enriched in focal adhesion pathways; these selected genes in Sunite camels were mainly enriched in ribosome pathways. We also found that Nanjiang ( HSPA4L and INTU ), and Alashan camels ( INO80E ) harbored genes related to the environment and characteristics. These findings provide useful insights into the genes related to the unique characteristics of domestic Bactrian camels in China, and a basis for genomic resource development in this species."
https://openalex.org/W3159574131,"The tight association between malnutrition and gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis enables microbiota-targeting intervention to be a promising strategy. Thus, we used a malnourished pig model to investigate the host response and GM alterations under different diet supplementation strategies. Pigs at age of 4 weeks were fed with pure maize diet to induce malnutrition symptoms, and followed by continuous feeding with maize (Maize, n = 8) or re-feeding using either corn-soy-blend (CSB+, n = 10) or millet-soy-blend based (MSB+, n = 10) supplementary food for 3 weeks. Meanwhile, 8 pigs were fed on a standard formulated ration as control (Ref). The effect of nutritional supplementation was assessed by the growth status, blood chemistry, gastrointestinal pathology, mucosal microbiota composition and colon production of short-chain fatty acids. Compared with purely maize-fed pigs, both CSB+ and MSB+ elevated the concentrations of total protein and globulin in blood. These pigs still showed most malnutrition symptoms after the food intervention period. MSB+ had superior influence on the GM development, exhibiting better performance in both structural and functional aspects. MSB+ pigs were colonized by less Proteobacteria but more Bacteroidetes , Firmicutes and Lachnospira spp. Pearson’s correlation analysis indicated a strong correlation between the abundance of mucosal e.g., Faecalibacterium and Lachnospira spp. and body weight, crown-rump length and total serum protein. In conclusion, the malnutrition symptoms were accompanied by an aberrant GM, and millet-based nutritional supplementation showed promising potentials to restore the reduced GM diversity implicated in pig malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W3158199060,"Background Globally, the safety of patients and healthcare providers is at risk due to health care-associated infections (HCAIs). World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend using alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) for hand hygiene in healthcare settings to prevent HCAIs. Irrational use of ABHR will have undesirable consequences including wastage of products, exposure of healthcare providers to infections and emergence of microbial resistance to the alcohol in hand sanitizers. This study aimed to explore the perspective and experiences of compounding pharmacists on production and utilization of ABHR solution for coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) prevention in public hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods A descriptive qualitative study using in-depth interview of 13 key-informants serving as compounding pharmacists in public hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, was conducted. The study participants were identified and selected by purposive sampling. All transcribed interviews were subjected to thematic analysis and transcripts were analyzed manually. Findings The compounding pharmacists in this study had a mean age of 30.6 (±3.1) years and nine of the thirteen participants were men. Ten participants believed that the compounding practice in their respective sites followed the principles of good compounding practice. More than half of the participants did not believe that ABHR products were used rationally in health facilities. They argued that users did not have enough awareness when and how to use sanitizers. Most of the interviewees reported that compounding personnel had no formal training on ABHR solution production. Study participants suggested incentive mechanisms and reimbursements for experts involved in the compounding of ABHR solutions. Conclusion Three of the compounding pharmacists indicated that ABHR production in their setting lack compliance to good compounding practice due to inadequate compounding room, quality control tests, manpower and equipment. Despite this, most study participants preferred the in-house ABHR products than the commercially available ones. Thus, training, regular monitoring and follow-up of the hospital compounding services can further build staff confidence."

Scientific literature reviews were performed using PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Mass media was compiled using Access World News/Newsbank, Newspaper Source, and Google. Results A total of 507,813 tweets were shared using #ThisIsOurLane, #ThisIsMyLane, or both (co-occurrence 21–39%). Fifteen scientific items and n = 358 mass media publications were published during the study period; the latter included articles, blogs, television interviews, petitions, press releases, and audio interviews/podcasts. Peak messaging appeared first on Twitter on November 10 th , followed by mass media on November 12 th and 20 th , and scientific publications during December. Conclusions Social media enables clinicians to quickly disseminate information about a complex public health issue like firearms to the mainstream media, scientific community, and general public alike. Humanized data resonates with people and has the ability to transcend the barriers of language, culture, and geography. Showing society the reality of caring for firearm-related injuries through healthcare worker stories via digital media appears to be effective in shaping the public agenda and influencing real-world events."
https://openalex.org/W3158833466,"Autophagy is the primary intracellular catabolic process for degrading and recycling long-lived proteins and damaged organelles, which maintains cellular homeostasis. Autophagy has key roles in development and differentiation. By using the mouse with liver specific knockout of autophagy related gene 5 ( Atg5 ), a gene essential for autophagy, we investigated the possible role of autophagy in liver regeneration after 70% partial hepatectomy (PHx). Ablation of autophagy significantly impaired mouse liver regeneration, and this impairment was associated with reduced hepatocellular proliferation rate, down-regulated expression of cyclins and tumor suppressors, and increased hepatocellular apoptosis via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Ablation of autophagy does not affect IL-6 and TNF-α response after PHx, but the altered hepatic and systemic metabolic responses were observed in these mice, including reduced ATP and hepatic free fatty acid levels in the liver tissue, increased glucose level in the serum. Autophagy is required to promote hepatocellular proliferation by maintaining normal hepatic and systemic metabolism and suppress hepatocellular apoptosis in liver regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3158957971,"In the epididymis, lysosomal proteins of the epithelial cells are normally targeted from the Golgi apparatus to lysosomes for degradation, although their secretion into the epididymal lumen has been documented and associated with sperm maturation. In this study, cathepsin D (CatD) and prosaposin (PSAP) were examined in adult epididymis of control, and 2-day castrated rats without (Ct) and with testosterone replacement (Ct+T) to evaluate their expression and regulation within epididymal epithelial cells. By light microscope-immunocytochemistry, a quantitative increase in size of lysosomes in principal cells of Ct animals was noted from the distal initial segment to the proximal cauda. Androgen replacement did not restore the size of lysosomes to control levels. Western blot analysis revealed a significant increase in CatD expression in the epididymis of Ct animals, which suggested an upregulation of its expression in principal cells; androgens restored levels of CatD to that of controls. In contrast, PSAP expression in Ct animals was not altered from controls. Additionally, an increase in procathepsin D levels was noted from samples of the epididymal fluid of Ct compared to control animals, accompanied by an increased complex formation with PSAP. Moreover, an increased oligomerization of prosaposin was observed in the epididymal lumen of Ct rats, with changes reverted to controls in Ct+T animals. Taken together these data suggest castration causes an increased uptake of substrates that are acted upon by CatD in lysosomes of principal cells and in the lumen by procathepsin D. These substrates may be derived from apoptotic cells noted in the lumen of proximal regions and possibly by degenerating sperm in distal regions of the epididymis of Ct animals. Exploring the mechanisms by which lysosomal enzymes are synthesized and secreted by the epididymis may help resolve some of the issues originating from epididymal dysfunctions with relevance to sperm maturation."
https://openalex.org/W3159353822,"To investigate changes in retinal thickness, drusen volume, and visual acuity following subthreshold nanosecond laser (SNL) treatment in patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD).Retrospective chart review.Patients with intermediate ARMD treated with a single session of SNL (2RT®, Ellex R&D Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia) were included. Swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging (Triton; Topcon Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) was performed within 6 months before and after SNL treatment. Retinal layers were segmented using the artificial intelligence-enabled Orion® software (Voxeleron LLC, San Francisco, USA). The macular region was analyzed according to the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study map. Mean difference and standard deviation in baseline and post-treatment retinal layer thicknesses are reported.37 eyes from 25 patients were included in this study (mean age 74.7±9.2 years). An average of 51±6 spots were applied around the macula of each study eye, with a mean spot power of 0.33±0.04mJ. Increases in total retinal thickness were observed within the outer temporal and inferior sectors (P<0.05). Within the annulus, there was an increase in thickness of the sub-retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) space [0.88±2.41μm, P = 0.03], defined between the RPE and Bruch's membrane. An increase in thickness of 1.13±2.55μm (P = 0.01) was also noted in the inferior sector of the photoreceptor complex, defined from the inner and outer segment junction to the RPE. Decreases in thickness were observed within the superior sector of the inner nuclear layer (INL) [-1.08±2.55μm, P = 0.01], and within the annulus of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) [-1.44±3.55μm, P = 0.02].At 6 months post-SNL treatment, there were sectoral increases in OPL, photoreceptor complex, and sub-RPE space thicknesses and sectoral decreases in INL and ONL thicknesses. This pilot study demonstrates the utility of OCT combined with artificial intelligence-enabled software to track retinal changes that occur following SNL treatment in intermediate ARMD."

Quality improvement (QI) interventions can improve retention of neonatal resuscitation knowledge and skills. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a scaled-up QI intervention package on uptake and retention of neonatal resuscitation knowledge and skills in simulated settings. Methods This was a pre-post study in 12 public hospitals of Nepal. Knowledge and skills of trainees on neonatal resuscitation were evaluated against the set standard before and after the introduction of QI interventions. Results Altogether 380 participants were included for knowledge evaluation and 286 for skill evaluation. The overall knowledge test score increased from 14.12 (pre-basic) to 15.91 (post-basic) during basic training (p &lt; 0 . 001) . The knowledge score decreased over time; 15.91 (post-basic) vs. 15.33 (pre-refresher) (p &lt; 0 . 001) . Overall skill score during basic training (16.98 ± 1.79) deteriorated over time to 16.44 ± 1.99 during refresher training (p &lt; 0 . 001) . The proportion of trainees passing the knowledge test increased to 91.1% (post-basic) from 67.9% (pre-basic) which decreased to 86.6% during refresher training after six months. The knowledge and skill scores were maintained above the set standard (&gt;14.0) over time at all hospitals during refresher training. Conclusion HBB training together with QI tools improves health workers’ knowledge and skills on neonatal resuscitation, irrespective of size and type of hospitals. The knowledge and skills deteriorate over time but do not fall below the standard. The HBB training together with QI interventions can be scaled up in other public hospitals. Trial registration This study was part of the larger Nepal Perinatal Quality Improvement Project (NePeriQIP) with International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number, ISRCTN30829654, registered 17 th of May, 2017."
https://openalex.org/W3159612377,"Globally, forest-savanna mosaic landscapes are of significant conservation importance but have been widely impacted by human land-use. We studied how restoration, through cessation of long-term cattle grazing impacts (i) forest regeneration; (ii) forest understory structure and composition; and (iii) populations and diversity of large mammals and nocturnal birds, within naturally patchy gallery forests in the Beni Savannas of Bolivia. Comparing grazed and restored sites, we assessed the abundance and composition of tree functional types at different life stages (seedlings, saplings and adults), with focus on the region’s key palm species Attalea princeps (motacú). Additionally, we surveyed habitat structure and composition in the shrub and ground-layer, and monitored occurrence and encounter rates of large mammals and nocturnal birds along dusk and evening transects. We found evidence of lower recruitment of motacú palms on the grazed site and lower potential for natural motacú regeneration. Principal Components Analysis revealed forests on grazed sites had simpler, more open shrub-layers and altered ground-layer structure and composition including increased bare ground. Mammal species richness was greater on the restored site, and there were more declining, globally threatened and site-unique species. Species richness was similar for nocturnal birds within forests on both the grazed and restored site, but nearly all species tended to be encountered more frequently on the restored site. Our results suggest cattle negatively impact forest regeneration and alter the structure and composition of the shrub and ground layer with potential consequences for the diversity and abundance of wildlife. Our study represents one of only a handful completed in the Beni region of Bolivia to date. The Beni is currently under pressure from widespread, largely unregulated cattle ranching. Our results thus provide vital evidence to support development of restoration and conservation policy, and its integration with rangeland management in this threatened and critically understudied region."
https://openalex.org/W3159632900,"To stop the COVID-19 pandemic due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused more than 2.5 million deaths to date, new antiviral molecules are urgently needed. The replication of SARS-CoV-2 requires the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), making RdRp an excellent target for antiviral agents. RdRp is a multi-subunit complex composed of 3 viral proteins named nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12 that ensure the ~30 kb RNA genome’s transcription and replication. The main strategies employed so far for the overproduction of RdRp consist of expressing and purifying the three subunits separately before assembling the complex in vitro . However, nsp12 shows limited solubility in bacterial expression systems and is often produced in insect cells. Here, we describe an alternative strategy to co-express the full SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in E . coli , using a single plasmid. Characterization of the purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RdRp shows that it forms a complex with the expected (nsp7)(nsp8) 2 (nsp12) stoichiometry. RNA polymerization activity was measured using primer-extension assays showing that the purified enzyme is functional. The purification protocol can be achieved in one single day, surpassing in speed all other published protocols. Our construct is ideally suited for screening RdRp and its variants against very large chemical compounds libraries and has been made available to the scientific community through the Addgene plasmid depository (Addgene ID: 165451)."
https://openalex.org/W3158056069,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is emerging as a global threat to public health. One of the strategies employed to combat AMR is the use of adjuvants which act to enhance or reinstate antimicrobial activity by inhibiting resistance mechanisms. However, these adjuvants are themselves not immune to selecting resistant phenotypes. Thus, there is a need to utilise mechanisms which are either less likely to or unable to trigger resistance. One commonly employed mechanism of resistance by microorganisms is to prevent antimicrobial uptake or efflux the antibiotic which manages to permeate its membrane. Here we propose amino acids as antimicrobial adjuvants that may be utilizing alternate mechanisms to fight AMR. We used a modified ethidium bromide (EtBr) efflux assay to determine its efflux in the presence of ciprofloxacin within Staphylococcus aureus (NCTC 8325) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1). In this study, aspartic acid and glutamic acid were found to inhibit growth of both bacterial species. Moreover, a reduced production of toxic pigments, pyocyanin and pyoverdine by P . aeruginosa was also observed. As evident from similar findings with tetracycline, these adjuvants, may be a way forward towards tackling antimicrobial resistance."
