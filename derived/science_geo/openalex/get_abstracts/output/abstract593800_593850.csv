https://openalex.org/W2748455458,"Black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae are a promising source of protein and lipid for animal feeds. The nutritional composition of the BSF larvae depend partly on the composition of the feeding medium. The BSF lipid profile in part mimics the feeding media lipid profile, and micronutrients, like minerals and vitamins, can readily accumulate in black soldier fly larvae. However, investigative studies on bioconversion and accumulation of nutrients from media to black soldier fly larvae are scarce. Here we show that inclusion of the brown algae Ascophyllum nodosum in the substrate for black soldier fly larvae can introduce valuable nutrients, commonly associated with the marine environment, into the larvae. The omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3), iodine and vitamin E concentrations increased in the larvae when more seaweed was included in the diet. When the feeding media consisted of more than 50% seaweed, the larvae experienced poorer growth, lower nutrient retention and lower lipid levels, compared to a pure plant based feeding medium. Our results confirm the plasticity of the nutritional make-up of black soldier fly larvae, allowing it to accumulate both lipid- and water-soluble compounds. A broader understanding of the effect of the composition of the feeding media on the larvae composition can help to tailor black soldier fly larvae into a nutrient profile more suited for specific feed or food purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2749529495,"Previous studies have identified the Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor WRKY70 as a node of convergence for salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated defense signal pathways and, together with its closest homolog WRKY54, as a negative regulator of SA biosynthesis. Here, we demonstrate that WRKY70 together with WRKY54 negatively affect the response of Arabidopsis to the necrotrophic pathogens Pectobacterium carotovorum and Botrytis cinerea, but not to the hemibiotroph Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst) DC3000, as revealed by mutants studies. Unstressed wrky54wrky70 double mutants exhibited increased levels of SA, accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and up-regulated expression of both SA and JA/ethylene (ET) responsive defense related genes. Additionally, protein cross-linking in cell wall was promoted by endogenous SA, suggesting involvement of wall-associated defenses against necrotrophs. This response to necrotrophs was compromised by introducing the sid2-1 allele impairing SA biosynthesis and leading to reduction of H2O2 content and of defense gene expression. The data suggest that the elevated SA level in the wrky54wrky70 double mutant results in moderate accumulation of H2O2, in promoting cell wall fortification and consequently enhanced resistance to necrotrophs but is not sufficient to trigger hypersensitive reaction (HR)-like cell death and resistance to biotrophs/hemibiotrophs like Pst DC3000."

Treatment with radio- and chemotherapy has increased survival making prognostic biomarkers increasingly important. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression and prognostic value of transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) as well as ferritin heavy (FTH) and light (FTL) chain in astrocytic brain tumors. A cohort of 111 astrocytic brain tumors (grade II-IV) was stained immunohistochemically with antibodies against TfR1, FTH, and FTL and scored semi-quantitatively. Double-immunofluorescence stainings were established to determine the phenotype of cells expressing these markers. We found that TfR1, FTH, and FTL were expressed by tumor cells in all grades. TfR1 increased with grade (p<0.001), but was not associated with prognosis in the individual grades. FTH and FTL were expressed by tumor cells and cells with microglial/macrophage morphology. Neither FTH nor FTL increased with malignancy grade, but low FTH expression by both tumor cells (p = 0.03) and microglia/macrophages (p = 0.01) correlated with shorter survival in patients anaplastic astrocytoma. FTL-positive microglia/macrophages were frequent in glioblastomas, and high FTL levels correlated with shorter survival in the whole cohort (p = 0.01) and in patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (p = 0.02). Double-immunofluorescence showed that TfR1, FTH, and FTL were co-expressed to a limited extent with the stem cell-related marker CD133. FTH and FTL were also co-expressed by IBA-1-positive microglia/macrophages. In conclusion, TfR1 was highly expressed in glioblastomas and associated with shorter survival in the whole cohort, but not in the individual malignancy grades. Low levels of FTH-positive tumor cells and microglia/macrophages were associated with poor survival in anaplastic astrocytomas, while high amounts of FTL-positive microglia/macrophages had a negative prognostic value. The results suggest that regulation of the iron metabolism in astrocytic brain tumors is complex involving both autocrine and paracrine signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2746697780,"Natural killer (NK) cells are a highly heterogeneous population of innate lymphocytes that constitute our first line of defense against several types of tumors and microbial infections. Understanding the heterogeneity of these lymphocytes requires the ability to integrate their underlying phenotype with dynamic functional behaviors. We have developed and validated a single-cell methodology that integrates cellular phenotyping and dynamic cytokine secretion based on nanowell arrays and bead-based molecular biosensors. We demonstrate the robust passivation of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based nanowells arrays with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and validated our assay by comparison to enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays. We used numerical simulations to optimize the molecular density of antibodies on the surface of the beads as a function of the capture efficiency of cytokines within an open-well system. Analysis of hundreds of individual human peripheral blood NK cells profiled ex vivo revealed that CD56dimCD16+ NK cells are immediate secretors of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) upon activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (< 3 h), and that there was no evidence of cooperation between NK cells leading to either synergistic activation or faster IFN-γ secretion. Furthermore, we observed that both the amount and rate of IFN-γ secretion from individual NK cells were donor-dependent. Collectively, these results establish our methodology as an investigational tool for combining phenotyping and real-time protein secretion of individual cells in a high-throughput manner."

Firstly, braking impulse and the maximum braking unit area of vacuum booster within a certain time are collected from braking operation, and then general braking and emergency braking characteristics are extracted to code the braking characteristics. Secondly, the braking behavior observation sequence is used to describe the initial parameters of hidden Markov model, and the generation of the hidden Markov model for differentiating and an observation sequence which is trained and judged by the driving style is introduced. Thirdly, the maximum likelihood logarithm could be implied from the observable parameters. The recognition accuracy of algorithm is verified through experiments and two common pattern recognition algorithms. The results showed that the driving style discrimination based on hidden Markov model algorithm could realize effective discriminant of driving style."
https://openalex.org/W2749258783,"Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to investigate the extraction condition of polysaccharide from cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.) (named CPP). Water to raw material ratio (10-30 mL/g), extraction time (40-80 min) and extraction temperature (60-100°C) were set as the 3 independent variables, and their effects on the extraction yield of CPP were measured. In addition, the effects of drying methods including hot air drying (HD), vacuum drying (VD) and freeze drying (FD) on the antioxidant activities of CPP were evaluated. The results showed that the optimal condition to extract CPP was: water to raw material ratio (15 mL/g), extraction time (61 min), and extraction temperature (97°C), a maximum CPP yield of 6.49% was obtained under this condition. CPP drying with FD method showed stronger reducing power (0.943 at 6 mg/mL) and radical scavenging capacities against DPPH radical (75.71% at 1.2 mg/mL) and ABTS radical (98.06 at 1.6 mg/mL) than CPP drying with HD and VD methods. Therefore, freeze drying served as a good method for keeping the antioxidant activities of polysaccharide from cup plant. The polysaccharide from cup plant has potential to use as a natural antioxidant."
https://openalex.org/W2745641617,"Background Smoking is a risk factor for tuberculosis (TB) infection and disease progression. Tobacco smoking increases susceptibility to TB in a variety of ways, one of which is due to a reduction of the IFN-γ response. Consequently, an impaired immune response could affect performance of IFN-γ Release Assays (IGRAs). Objective In the present study, we assess the impact of direct tobacco smoking on radiological manifestations, sputum conversion and immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, analyzing IFN-γ secretion by IGRAs. Methods A total of 525 participants were studied: (i) 175 active pulmonary TB patients and (ii) 350 individuals coming from contact tracing studies, 41 of whom were secondary TB cases. Clinical, radiological and microbiological data were collected. T-SPOT.TB and QFN-G-IT were processed according manufacturer’s instructions. Results In smoking patients with active TB, QFN-G-IT (34.4%) and T-SPOT.TB (19.5%) had high frequencies of negative results. In addition, by means of an unconditional logistic regression, smoking was a main factor associated with IGRAs’ false-negative results (aOR: 3.35; 95%CI:1.47–7.61; p<0.05). Smoking patients with active TB presented a high probability of having cavitary lesions (aOR: 1.88; 95%CI:1.02–3.46;p<0.05). Mean culture negativization (months) ± standard deviation (SD) was higher in smokers than in non-smokers (2.47±1.3 versus 1.69±1.4). Latent TB infection (LTBI) was favored in smoking contacts, being a risk factor associated with infection (aOR: 11.57; 95%CI:5.97–22.41; p<0.00005). The IFN-γ response was significantly higher in non-smokers than in smokers. Smoking quantity and IFN-γ response analyzed by IGRAs were dose-dependent related. Conclusions Smoking had a negative effect on radiological manifestations, delaying time of sputum conversion. Our data establish a link between tobacco smoking and TB due to a weakened IFN-γ response caused by direct tobacco smoke."
https://openalex.org/W2749159955,"Periodontitis is characterized by the loss of the supporting tissues of the teeth in an inflammatory-infectious context. The diagnosis relies on clinical and X-ray examination. Unfortunately, clinical signs of tissue destruction occur late in the disease progression. Therefore, it is mandatory to identify reliable biomarkers to facilitate a better and earlier management of this disease. To this end, saliva represents a promising fluid for identification of biomarkers as metabolomic fingerprints. The present study used high-resolution 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy coupled with multivariate statistical analysis to identify the metabolic signature of active periodontitis. The metabolome of stimulated saliva of 26 patients with generalized periodontitis (18 chronic and 8 aggressive) was compared to that of 25 healthy controls. Principal Components Analysis (PCA), performed with clinical variables, indicated that the patient population was homogeneous, demonstrating a strong correlation between the clinical and the radiological variables used to assess the loss of periodontal tissues and criteria of active disease. Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structure (OPLS) analysis showed that patients with periodontitis can be discriminated from controls on the basis of metabolite concentrations in saliva with satisfactory explained variance (R2X = 0.81 and R2Y = 0.61) and predictability (Q2Y = 0.49, CV-AUROC = 0.94). Interestingly, this discrimination was irrespective of the type of generalized periodontitis, i.e. chronic or aggressive. Among the main discriminating metabolites were short chain fatty acids as butyrate, observed in higher concentrations, and lactate, γ-amino-butyrate, methanol, and threonine observed in lower concentrations in periodontitis. The association of lactate, GABA, and butyrate to generate an aggregated variable reached the best positive predictive value for diagnosis of periodontitis. In conclusion, this pilot study showed that 1H-NMR spectroscopy analysis of saliva could differentiate patients with periodontitis from controls. Therefore, this simple, robust, non-invasive method, may offer a significant help for early diagnosis and follow-up of periodontitis."
https://openalex.org/W2750323808,"Traumatic brain Injury (TBI) is a significant cause of death and long-term disability for which there are currently no effective pharmacological treatment options. In this study then, we utilized a mouse model of TBI to assess the therapeutic potential of the stable disaccharide trehalose, which is known to protect against oxidative stress, increase levels of chaperone molecules and enhance autophagy. Furthermore, trehalose has demonstrated neuroprotective properties in numerous animal models and has been proposed as a potential treatment for neurodegeneration. As TBI (and associated neurodegenerative disorders) is complicated by a sudden and dramatic change in brain metal concentrations, including iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn), the collective accumulation and translocation of which has been hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of TBI, then we also sought to determine whether trehalose modulated the metal dyshomeostasis associated with TBI. In this study three-month-old C57Bl/6 wildtype mice received a controlled cortical impact TBI, and were subsequently treated for one month with trehalose. During this time animals were assessed on multiple behavioral tasks prior to tissue collection. Results showed an overall significant improvement in the Morris water maze, Y-maze and open field behavioral tests in trehalose-treated mice when compared to controls. These functional benefits occurred in the absence of any change in lesion volume or any significant modulation of biometals, as assessed by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Western blot analysis, however, revealed an upregulation of synaptophysin, doublecortin and brain derived neurotrophic factor protein in trehalose treated mice in the contralateral cortex. These results indicate that trehalose may be efficacious in improving functional outcomes following TBI by a previously undescribed mechanism of action that has relevance to multiple disorders of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2747545837,"Chronic bacterial biofilms place a massive burden on healthcare due to the presence of antibiotic-tolerant dormant bacteria. Some of the conventional antibiotics such as erythromycin, vancomycin, linezolid, rifampicin etc. are inherently ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria, particularly in their biofilms. Here, we report membrane-active macromolecules that kill slow dividing stationary-phase and antibiotic tolerant cells of Gram-negative bacteria. More importantly, these molecules potentiate antibiotics (erythromycin and rifampicin) to biofilms of Gram-negative bacteria. These molecules eliminate planktonic bacteria that are liberated after dispersion of biofilms (dispersed cells). The membrane-active mechanism of these molecules forms the key for potentiating the established antibiotics. Further, we demonstrate that the combination of macromolecules and antibiotics significantly reduces bacterial burden in mouse burn and surgical wound infection models caused by Acinetobacter baumannii and Carbapenemase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC) clinical isolate respectively. Colistin, a well-known antibiotic targeting the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria fails to kill antibiotic tolerant cells and dispersed cells (from biofilms) and bacteria develop resistance to it. On the contrary, these macromolecules prevent or delay the development of bacterial resistance to known antibiotics. Our findings emphasize the potential of targeting the bacterial membrane in antibiotic potentiation for disruption of biofilms and suggest a promising strategy towards developing therapies for topical treatment of Gram-negative infections."
https://openalex.org/W2746388803,"Effective management of widespread invasive species such as wild pigs (Sus scrofa) is limited by resources available to devote to the effort. Better insight of the effectiveness of different management strategies on population dynamics is important for guiding decisions of resource allocation over space and time. Using a dynamic population model, we quantified effects of culling intensities and time between culling events on population dynamics of wild pigs in the USA using empirical culling patterns and data-based demographic parameters. In simulated populations closed to immigration, substantial population declines (50–100%) occurred within 4 years when 20–60% of the population was culled annually, but when immigration from surrounding areas occurred, there was a maximum of 50% reduction, even with the maximum culling intensity of 60%. Incorporating hypothetical levels of fertility control with realistic culling intensities was most effective in reducing populations when they were closed to immigration and when intrinsic population growth rate was too high (> = 1.78) to be controlled by culling alone. However, substantial benefits from fertility control used in conjunction with culling may only occur over a narrow range of net population growth rates (i.e., where net is the result of intrinsic growth rates and culling) that varies depending on intrinsic population growth rate. The management implications are that the decision to use fertility control in conjunction with culling should rely on concurrent consideration of achievable culling intensity, underlying demographic parameters, and costs of culling and fertility control. The addition of fertility control reduced abundance substantially more than culling alone, however the effects of fertility control were weaker than in populations without immigration. Because these populations were not being reduced substantially by culling alone, fertility control could be an especially helpful enhancement to culling for reducing abundance to target levels in areas where immigration can’t be prevented."
https://openalex.org/W2749285452,"Progranulin (PGRN) is a multifunctional protein that is widely expressed throughout the brain, where it has been shown to act as a critical regulator of CNS inflammation and also functions as an autocrine neuronal growth factor, important for long-term neuronal survival. PGRN has been shown to activate cell signaling pathways regulating excitoxicity, oxidative stress, and synaptogenesis, as well as amyloidogenesis. Together, these critical roles in the CNS suggest that PGRN has the potential to be an important therapeutic target for the treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is the leading cause of dementia and is marked by the appearance of extracellular plaques consisting of aggregates of amyloid-β (Aβ), as well as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal loss and synaptic atrophy. The ability of PGRN to target multiple key features of AD pathophysiology suggests that enhancing its expression may benefit this disease. Here, we describe the application of PGRN gene transfer using in vivo delivery of lentiviral expression vectors in a transgenic mouse model of AD. Viral vector delivery of the PGRN gene effectively enhanced PGRN expression in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice. This elevated PGRN expression significantly reduced amyloid plaque burden in these mice, accompanied by reductions in markers of inflammation and synaptic atrophy. The overexpression of PGRN was also found to increase activity of neprilysin, a key amyloid beta degrading enzyme. PGRN regulation of neprilysin activity could play a major role in the observed alterations in plaque burden. Thus, PGRN may be an effective therapeutic target for the treatment of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2747538276,"Health committees are a common strategy to foster community participation in health. Efforts to strengthen committees often focus on technical inputs to improve committee form (e.g. representative membership) and functioning (e.g. meeting procedures). However, porous and interconnected contextual spheres also mediate committee effectiveness. Using a framework for contextual analysis, we explored the contextual features that facilitated or hindered Village Health, Sanitation and Nutrition Committee (VHSNC) functionality in rural north India. We conducted interviews (n = 74), focus groups (n = 18) and observation over 1.5 years. Thematic content analysis enabled the identification and grouping of themes, and detailed exploration of sub-themes. While the intervention succeeded in strengthening committee form and functioning, participant accounts illuminated the different ways in which contextual influences impinged on VHSNC efficacy. Women and marginalized groups navigated social hierarchies that curtailed their ability to assert themselves in the presence of men and powerful local families. These dynamics were not static and unchanging, illustrated by pre-existing cross-caste problem solving, and the committee's creation of opportunities for the careful violation of social norms. Resource and capacity deficits in government services limited opportunities to build relationships between health system actors and committee members and engendered mistrust of government institutions. Fragmented administrative accountability left committee members bearing responsibility for improving local health without access to stakeholders who could support or respond to their efforts. The committee's narrow authority was at odds with widespread community needs, and committee members struggled to involve diverse government services across the health, sanitation, and nutrition sectors. Multiple parallel systems (political decentralization, media and other village groups) presented opportunities to create more enabling VHSNC contexts, although the potential to harness these opportunities was largely unmet. This study highlights the urgent need for supportive contexts in which people can not only participate in health committees, but also access the power and resources needed to bring about actual improvements to their health and wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W2747269915,"Background Physicians commonly advise patients to begin disease modifying therapies (DMT’s) shortly after the establishment of a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) to prevent further relapses and disease progression. However, little is known about the meaning for patients going through the process of the diagnosis of MS and of making decisions on DMT’s in early MS. Objective To explore the patient perspective on using DMT’s for MS. Methods: Ten participants with a recent (< 2 years) relapsing-remitting MS diagnosis were interviewed. Seven of them were using DMT’s at the time of the interview. All interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a hermeneutical-phenomenological approach. Results The analysis revealed the following themes: (1) Constant confrontation with the disease, (2) Managing inevitable decline, (3) Hope of delaying the progression of the disease, and, (4) The importance of social support. The themes show that patients associate the recommendation to begin DMT’s (especially injectable DMT’s) with views about their bodies as well as their hopes about the future. Both considering and adhering to treatment are experienced by patients as not only matters of individual and rational deliberation, but also as activities that are lived within a web of relationships with relatives and friends. Conclusion From the patient perspective, the use of DMT’s is not a purely rational and individual experience. More attention to the use of DMT’s as relational and lived phenomena will improve the understanding of the process of decision-making for DMT’s in MS."

This study aimed to longitudinally examine the development of bullying and victimization in Chinese students in grades 4, 5, and 6. We used latent class analysis to empirically identify groups of youth with different bullying and victimization patterns, and then used latent transition analysis to explore the movement of children between these latent classes over time. Results showed that: (1) across the three time points, students could be classified into four classes: bullies, victims, bully-victims, and non-involved children; and (2) students in the non-involved class tended to remain in that class when moving to higher grades, students in the bully and victims classes tended to transition to the non-involved class, while students in the bully-victims class tended to transition to the bullies class. Thus, future intervention should be implemented to prevent bully-victims from bullying behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2748505846,"During cochlear implantation, electrode array translocation and trauma should be avoided to preserve residual hearing. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of physical parameters of the array on residual hearing and cochlear structures during insertion. Three array prototypes with different stiffnesses or external diameters were implanted in normal hearing guinea pigs via a motorized insertion tool carried on a robot-based arm, and insertion forces were recorded. Array prototypes 0.4 and 0.4R had 0.4 mm external diameter and prototype 0.3 had 0.3 mm external diameter. The axial stiffness was set to 1 for the 0.4 prototype and the stiffnesses of the 0.4R and 0.3 prototypes were calculated from this as 6.8 and 0.8 (relative units), respectively. Hearing was assessed preoperatively by the auditory brainstem response (ABR), and then at day 7 and day 30 post-implantation. A study of the macroscopic anatomy was performed on cochleae harvested at day 30 to examine the scala location of the array. At day 7, guinea pigs implanted with the 0.4R array had significantly poorer hearing results than those implanted with the 0.3 array (26±17.7, 44±23.4, 33±20.5 dB, n = 7, vs 5±8.7, 1±11.6, 12±11.5 dB, n = 6, mean±SEM, respectively, at 8, 16 and 24 kHz, p<0.01) or those implanted with the 0.4 array (44±23.4 dB, n = 7, vs 28±21.7 dB, n = 7, at 16 kHz, p<0.05). Hearing remained stable from day 7 to day 30. The maximal peak of insertion force was higher with the 0.4R array than with the 0.3 array (56±23.8 mN, n = 7, vs 26±8.7 mN, n = 6). Observation of the cochleae showed that an incorrectly positioned electrode array or fibrosis were associated with hearing loss ≥40 dB (at 16 kHz). An optimal position in the scala tympani with a flexible and thin array and prevention of fibrosis should be the primary objectives to preserve hearing during cochlear implantation."
https://openalex.org/W2748149837,"Rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) is a native shrub from South African fynbos and has become very popular in the last decades for its antioxidant and medicinal attributes. Several studies have shown its beneficial properties in numerous cell lines, but to date, the in vitro effects of rooibos extract on sperm cells are still unknown. In this study, boar semen was supplemented with four concentrations both of fermented and unfermented rooibos extracts during 96 h of liquid storage at 17°C. The effects of rooibos extracts on sperm velocity, membrane integrity, and acrosomal status were evaluated at 2 h, 48 h, and 96 h of semen storage. Overall our results indicate that rooibos extract enhances sperm velocity, protects the acrosome structure, and tends to preserve the membrane integrity during semen storage. Although the unfermented rooibos showed higher total polyphenol content and total antioxidant capacity than the fermented one, the latter had better effects on sperm velocity leading to, for instance, an increase of 30% in the rectilinear velocity (VSL) at 48 h compared to the control group. Taking into account the different storage times, we established a suitable range of extracts concentrations to be used in boar semen. The rooibos extract ought to be considered as a powerful and natural source of antioxidants for the preservation of boar semen."
https://openalex.org/W2747628283,"Background Septic shock is associated with high mortality. Aged and multimorbid patients are not always eligible for intensive care units. Norepinephrine is an accepted treatment for hypotension in septic shock. It is unknown whether norepinephrine has a place in treatment outside an intensive care unit and when given peripherally. Objectives To describe mortality, Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE-II), time to mean arterial pressure >65 mmHg, and adverse events in patients with septic shock receiving norepinephrine peripherally in an intermediate care unit. Methods From a retrospective chart review of 91 patients with septic shock treated with norepinephrine for hypotension, ward mortality, 30-, 60- and 90-day mortality, standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and adverse events (necrosis and arrhythmia) were analysed. Administration route via peripheral venous catheter or central venous catheter was registered. Results Median age was 81 (43–96) years and median APACHE-II score was 26 (12–42). Observed ward mortality was 27.5% (SMR 0.443, 95% CI: 0.287–0.654), and 30-day and 90-day mortality were 47.2% and 58.2%, respectively. Conclusions Elderly patients with septic shock treated with norepinephrine displayed a better survival in the ward and at 30 days than expected. Our retrospective study did not indicate frequent complications when administering norepinephrine via a peripheral venous catheter."
https://openalex.org/W2749625527,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive condition characterized by occlusive pulmonary arteriopathy, in which survival remains poor despite pharmacologic advances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), cardiac progenitor cells with potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, to attenuate hemodynamic and morphometric remodeling of the right ventricle (RV) and pulmonary arterioles in rats with established monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH. Animals were divided into 3 groups: 1) Control (CTL), 2) PAH in which CDCs were centrally infused (CDC) and 3) PAH in which saline was given (Sham). Significant increments in RV systolic pressure (RVSP) and RV hypertrophy were noted in Sham animals compared to CTL. In CDC rats at day 35, RSVP fell (- 38%; p< 0.001) and RV hypertrophy decreased (-26%; p< 0.01). TAPSE and cardiac output were preserved in all 3 groups at day 35. Pulmonary arteriolar wall thickness was greater in Sham rats compared to CTL, and reduced in CDC animals for vessels 20–50 μm (P<0.01; back to CTL levels) and 50–80μm (P<0.01) in diameter. The macrophage population was increased in Sham animals compared to CTL (P< 0.001), but markedly reduced in CDC rats. In conclusion, infusion of CDCs markedly attenuated several key pathophysiologic features of PAH. As adjunctive therapy to PAH-specific agents, CDCs have the potential to impact on the pathobiology of adverse pulmonary arteriolar remodeling, by acting on multiple mechanisms simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W2745477739,"One important aim in cell culture-based viral vaccine and vector production is the implementation of continuous processes. Such a development has the potential to reduce costs of vaccine manufacturing as volumetric productivity is increased and the manufacturing footprint is reduced. In this work, continuous production of Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus was investigated. First, a semi-continuous two-stage cultivation system consisting of two shaker flasks in series was established as a small-scale approach. Cultures of the avian AGE1.CR.pIX cell line were expanded in the first shaker, and MVA virus was propagated and harvested in the second shaker over a period of 8-15 days. A total of nine small-scale cultivations were performed to investigate the impact of process parameters on virus yields. Harvest volumes of 0.7-1 L with maximum TCID50 titers of up to 1.0×109 virions/mL were obtained. Genetic analysis of control experiments using a recombinant MVA virus containing green-fluorescent-protein suggested that the virus was stable over at least 16 d of cultivation. In addition, a decrease or fluctuation of infectious units that may indicate an excessive accumulation of defective interfering particles was not observed. The process was automated in a two-stage continuous system comprising two connected 1 L stirred tank bioreactors. Stable MVA virus titers, and a total production volume of 7.1 L with an average TCID50 titer of 9×107 virions/mL was achieved. Because titers were at the lower range of the shake flask cultivations potential for further process optimization at large scale will be discussed. Overall, MVA virus was efficiently produced in continuous and semi-continuous cultivations making two-stage stirred tank bioreactor systems a promising platform for industrial production of MVA-derived recombinant vaccines and viral vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2746498501,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been widely used as an alternative treatment modality for liver tumors. Monitoring the temperature distribution in the tissue during RFA is required to assess the thermal dosage. Ultrasound temperature imaging based on the detection of echo time shifts has received the most attention in the past decade. The coefficient k, connecting the temperature change and the echo time shift, is a medium-dependent parameter used to describe the confounding effects of changes in the speed of sound and thermal expansion as temperature increases. The current algorithm of temperature estimate based on echo time shift detection typically uses a constant k, resulting in estimation errors when ablation temperatures are higher than 50°C. This study proposes an adaptive-k algorithm that enables the automatic adjustment of the coefficient k during ultrasound temperature monitoring of RFA. To verify the proposed algorithm, RFA experiments on in vitro porcine liver samples (total n = 15) were performed using ablation powers of 10, 15, and 20 W. During RFA, a clinical ultrasound system equipped with a 7.5-MHz linear transducer was used to collect backscattered signals for ultrasound temperature imaging using the constant- and adaptive-k algorithms. Concurrently, an infrared imaging system and thermocouples were used to measure surface temperature distribution of the sample and internal ablation temperatures for comparisons with ultrasound estimates. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed adaptive-k method improved the performance in visualizing the temperature distribution. In particular, the estimation errors were also reduced even when the temperature of the tissue is higher than 50°C. The proposed adaptive-k ultrasound temperature imaging strategy has potential to serve as a thermal dosage evaluation tool for monitoring high-temperature RFA."

It is, however, not clear whether this association reflects a chronic elevation or acute inflammatory response. We analyzed NAMPT concentrations in distinct states of inflammation in 102 children and found consistently significantly increased NAMPT levels in subjects with acute infections. NAMPT concentrations in children with stable chronic inflammatory diseases were not significantly different, whereas in patients with acute relapse of chronic disease NAMPT was significantly higher than in children in remission or healthy controls. In states of low-grade inflammation (children with atopic disease or obesity) we did not detect alterations in NAMPT serum levels. NAMPT correlated positively with inflammatory markers such as CRP. The most predictive factor for NAMPT serum concentrations was leucocyte count and therein the neutrophil count. Furthermore, systemic circulating NAMPT levels were closely associated with NAMPT release from corresponding cultured PBMCs. In conclusion, NAMPT is selectively increased in states of acute but not chronic inflammation in children. The close relationship between systemic circulating NAMPT with leucocyte counts and release indicate that leucocytes most probably are the source of inflammation related NAMPT levels."

After a lecture, face-to-face tailored counseling was used to set contractually binding goals regarding reducing and breaking up sitting periods and increasing light intensity physical activity during work and leisure time. Primary outcomes of total, work and leisure sedentary time (<100 counts/min, cpm), light activity time (<2020 cpm), moderate-to-vigorous activity time (MVPA) and breaks/sedentary hour were assessed with a waist-worn Alive -accelerometer for 7 days, 5 times during the year. Anthropometrics (DXA), fasting biomarkers and self-reported diet were assessed as secondary outcomes. Data were collected between 2011-2013 and analyzed between 2013-2016 with a linear mixed-effects model fit by REML using likelihood ratio test and intention-to-treat-principle.Participants from intervention (N = 71) and control (N = 62) regions were assessed at baseline and 117 completed the study. Sedentary leisure time decreased [-21.2 (95% CI -37.3 to -5.1) min/8 hours, likelihood ratio P<0.001] and light activity time [13.4 (-2.2 to 29.0) min/8 hours, P = 0.008] and breaks per sedentary hour [1.0 (-0.2 to 2.2), P = 0.010] increased in the intervention group as compared to controls at 3 months. The decrease in sedentary leisure time was maintained throughout the year [-7.9 (-24.0 to 8.3) min/8 hours, P = 0.029]. Small decreases in the control group's work and leisure MVPA were observed mostly at 3 months. Small favorable intervention effects were observed for fasting plasma glucose at 3 months and for leg lean mass and apoB/apoA-1 ratio at 12 months, with no changes in other outcomes.Behavioral counseling induced a small decline in sedentary leisure time throughout one year in parents with a sedentary occupation and young children. Small concurrent changes in different biomarkers suggest that reducing sedentary leisure time during one year may be beneficial.ISRCTN28668090, registered 30 November 2011."
https://openalex.org/W2745884621,"The key metabolic enzyme phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) controls glucose homeostasis in most human cells. Four proteins related to PGM1, known as PGM2, PGM2L1, PGM3 and PGM5, and referred to herein as paralogs, are encoded in the human genome. Although all members of the same enzyme superfamily, these proteins have distinct substrate preferences and different functional roles. The recent association of PGM1 and PGM3 with inherited enzyme deficiencies prompts us to revisit sequence-structure and other relationships among the PGM1 paralogs, which are understudied despite their importance in human biology. Using currently available sequence, structure, and expression data, we investigated evolutionary relationships, tissue-specific expression profiles, and the amino acid preferences of key active site motifs. Phylogenetic analyses indicate both ancient and more recent divergence between the different enzyme sub-groups comprising the human paralogs. Tissue-specific protein and RNA expression profiles show widely varying patterns for each paralog, providing insight into function and disease pathology. Multiple sequence alignments confirm high conservation of key active site regions, but also reveal differences related to substrate specificity. In addition, we find that sequence variants of PGM2, PGM2L1, and PGM5 verified in the human population affect residues associated with disease-related mutants in PGM1 or PGM3. This suggests that inherited diseases related to dysfunction of these paralogs will likely occur in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2748594459,"Background The involvement of patients in medical decision making has been investigated widely in somatic diseases. However, little is known about the preferences for involvement and variables that could predict these preferences in patients with mental disorders. Objective This study aims to determine what roles mentally ill patients actually want to assume when making medical decisions and to identify the variables that could predict this role, including patients’ self-efficacy. Method Demographic and clinical data of 798 patients with mental disorders from three psychotherapeutic units in Germany were elicited using self-report questionnaires. Control preference was measured using the Control Preferences Scale, and patients’ perceived self-efficacy was assessed using the Self-Efficacy Scale. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to investigate the associations between patient variables and control preference. Results Most patients preferred a collaborative role (57.5%), followed by a semi passive (21.2%), a partly autonomous (16.2%), an autonomous (2.8%) and a fully passive (2.3%) role when making medical decisions. Age, sex, diagnosis, employment status, medical pretreatment and perceived self-efficacy were associated with the preference for involvement in the multivariate logistic model. Conclusion Our results confirm the preferences for involvement in medical decisions of mentally ill patients. We reconfirmed previous findings that older patients prefer a shared role over an autonomous role and that subjects with a high qualification prefer a more autonomous role over a shared role. The knowledge about predictors may help strengthen treatment effectiveness because matching the preferred and actual role preferences has been shown to improve clinical outcome."

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of subconjunctival administration of anti-HMGB1 on dry eye in a mouse model of Sjӧgren's syndrome.Ten weeks-old NOD.B10.H2b mice were subconjunctivally injected with 0.02 to 2 μg of anti-HMGB1 antibodies or PBS twice a week for two consecutive weeks. Tear volume and corneal staining scores were measured and compared between before- and after-treatment. Goblet cell density was counted in PAS stained forniceal conjunctiva and inflammatory foci score (>50 cells/focus) was measured in extraorbital glands. Flow cytometry was performed to evaluate the changes in BrdU+ cells, IL-17-, IL-10-, or IFNγ-secreting cells, functional B cells, and IL-22 secreting innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) in cervical lymph nodes. The level of IL-22 in intraorbital glands was measured by ELISA.Injection of 2 μg or 0.02 μg anti-HMGB1 attenuated corneal epithelial erosions and increased tear secretion (p<0.05). Goblet cell density was increased in 0.2 μg and 2 μg anti-HMGB1-treated-mice with marginal significance. The inflammatory foci score, and the number of BrdU+ cells, IL-17-, IL-10-, IFNγ-secreting cells, and functional B cells did not significantly change following anti-HMGB1 treatment. Surprisingly, the percentage of ILC3s was significantly increased in the draining lymph nodes (p<0.05), and the expression of IL-22 was significantly increased in the intraorbital glands (p<0.05) after administration of 2 μg anti-HMGB1.This study shows that subconjunctival administration of anti-HMGB1 attenuates clinical manifestations of dry eye. The improvement of dry eye may involve an increase of ILC3s, rather than modulation of B or plasma cells, as shown using a mouse model of Sjӧgren's syndrome."

It enhances soil aeration and, through its engineering activities, makes otherwise-inaccessible food available for other marine organisms. Despite its importance, the habitat of A. occidentalis is threatened by human activities. Clearing the mangroves for salt farming and selective logging of mangroves trees continue to jeopardise mangrove ecosystems in the Western Indian Ocean. This study aims to use partial mitochondrial COI gene sequences and nuclear microsatellites to determine whether salt farming activities in mangroves have a negative impact on the genetic diversity and gene flow of A. occidentalis collected along the Tanzania coast. The level of genetic diversity for both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear microsatellites are relatively lower in samples from salt ponds compared to natural mangrove sites. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) among all populations showed low but significant differentiation (COI: Fst = 0.022, P < 0.05; microsatellites: Fst = 0.022, P < 0.001). A hierarchical AMOVA indicates lower but significant genetic differentiation among populations from salt ponds and natural mangroves sites (COI: Fct = 0.033, P < 0.05; microsatellites: Fct = 0.018, P = < 0.01). These results indicate that salt farming has a significant negative impact on the genetic diversity of A. occidentalis. Since higher genetic diversity contributes to a stable population, restoring the cleared habitats might be the most effective measures for the conservation of genetic diversity and hence adaptive potential to environmental change in this species."

We tested the prototype device both in a controlled laboratory setting and in a fingerstick study involving naive device users, and found it to have accuracy and precision similar to a conventional pipettor. The users also found the device to be easy to use, and recommended minor ergonomic improvements. Our device would allow performance of multiple POC tests from a single fingerstick blood sample, thus providing a novel functionality that may be of use in many testing settings worldwide."

While more than 120 Francisella genomes have been sequenced to date, only a few contain plasmids, and most of these appear to be cryptic, with unknown benefit to the host cell. We have identified several putative cryptic plasmids in the sequenced genomes of three Francisella novicida and F. novicida-like strains (TX07-6608, AZ06-7470, DPG_3A-IS) and two new Francisella species (F. frigiditurris CA97-1460 and F. opportunistica MA06-7296). These plasmids were compared to each other and to previously identified plasmids from other Francisella species. Some of the plasmids encoded functions potentially involved in replication, conjugal transfer and partitioning, environmental survival (transcriptional regulation, signaling, metabolism), and hypothetical proteins with no assignable functions. Genomic and phylogenetic comparisons of these new plasmids to the other known Francisella plasmids revealed some similarities that add to our understanding of the evolutionary relationships among the diverse Francisella species."

Method Between 2012 and 2014, 183 patients underwent the procedure using a sheath diameter of 18–24 F. This collective was divided into two groups: group 1, with a sheath diameter of 18F (G1, n = 94), consisted of patients with 18F Medtronic Sentrant and 18 F Direct Flow sheaths, and group 2 with a sheath diameter of 19–24 F (G2, n = 89) consisted of patients with Edwards expandable e-sheath and Solopath sheaths. Perclose-Proglide® was used as a closure device in all patients. Results G1 had significantly more female patients (64.9% vs. 46.1% in G2, p = 0.01) and the average BMI was lower (26 ± 4.5% vs. 27.4 ± 4.7%, p = 0.03). There was no significant difference in the incidence of major and minor vascular complications (G1: 12.8% vs. G2: 12.4%, p = 0.9). 30-day mortality was similar in both groups (G1: 6.4 ± 2.5% [95% CI: 0.88–0.98], G2: 3.7 ± 1.9% [95% CI: 0.92–0.99].

https://openalex.org/W2747514382,"Predation can strongly influence community structure and ecosystem function, so the loss of key predators can have dramatic ecological consequences, unless other predatory species in the system are capable of playing similar ecological roles. In light of the recent outbreak of sea star wasting disease (SSWD) and subsequent depletion of west coast sea star populations, including those of the keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus, we examined whether large mobile crabs could play a role as predators on mussels (Mytilus californianus) on a rocky shore in Northern California. Using a combination of sea star removal and predator exclusion cages we found that mussel mortality was 43–294 times greater in uncaged treatments versus caged treatments. Mortality on uncaged mussels at low tidal elevations was due to predation by large mobile crabs (Cancer productus and Romaleon antennarium); confirmed by the presence of mussel shell fragments and documented attacks on wax snail replicas. Laboratory feeding assays indicated that crabs, on a per unit biomass basis, can consume almost twenty-five times as many mussels per day than sea stars, which together with the results of our field experiment, suggest that large predatory crabs could play an important role in maintaining ecosystem function through their predation on mussels on rocky shores where P. ochraceus are rare, absent, or have been depleted by SSWD."

https://openalex.org/W2747539919,"Mathematical models (MMs) have been used to study the kinetics of influenza A virus infections under antiviral therapy, and to characterize the efficacy of antivirals such as neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs). NAIs prevent viral neuraminidase from cleaving sialic acid receptors that bind virus progeny to the surface of infected cells, thereby inhibiting their release, suppressing infection spread. When used to study treatment with NAIs, MMs represent viral release implicitly as part of viral replication. Consequently, NAIs in such MMs do not act specifically and exclusively on virus release. We compared a MM with an explicit representation of viral release (i.e., distinct from virus production) to a simple MM without explicit release, and investigated whether parameter estimation and the estimation of NAI efficacy were affected by the use of a simple MM. Since the release rate of influenza A virus is not well-known, a broad range of release rates were considered. If the virus release rate is greater than ∼0.1 h-1, the simple MM provides accurate estimates of infection parameters, but underestimates NAI efficacy, which could lead to underdosing and the emergence of NAI resistance. In contrast, when release is slower than ∼0.1 h-1, the simple MM accurately estimates NAI efficacy, but it can significantly overestimate the infectious lifespan (i.e., the time a cell remains infectious and producing free virus), and it will significantly underestimate the total virus yield and thus the likelihood of resistance emergence. We discuss the properties of, and a possible lower bound for, the influenza A virus release rate."
https://openalex.org/W2747735546,"Background Stem cell therapy to improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction is hampered by poor cell retention, while it may also increase the risk of arrhythmias by providing an arrhythmogenic substrate. We previously showed that porcine adipose tissue-derived-stromal cells (pASC) induce conduction slowing through paracrine actions, whereas rat ASC (rASC) and human ASC (hASC) induce conduction slowing by direct coupling. We postulate that biomaterial microspheres mitigate the conduction slowing influence of pASC by interacting with paracrine signaling. Aim To investigate the modulation of ASC-loaded recombinant human collagen-based microspheres, on the electrophysiological behavior of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM). Method Unipolar extracellular electrograms, derived from microelectrode arrays (8x8 electrodes) containing NRVM, co-cultured with ASC or ASC loaded microspheres, were used to determine conduction velocity (CV) and conduction heterogeneity. Conditioned medium (Cme) of (co)cultures was used to assess paracrine mechanisms. Results Microspheres did not affect CV in control (NRVM) monolayers. In co-cultures of NRVM and rASC, hASC or pASC, CV was lower than in controls (14.4±1.0, 13.0±0.6 and 9.0± 1.0 vs. 19.5±0.5 cm/s respectively, p<0.001). Microspheres loaded with either rASC or hASC still induced conduction slowing compared to controls (13.5±0.4 and 12.6±0.5 cm/s respectively, p<0.001). However, pASC loaded microspheres increased CV of NRVM compared to pASC and NRMV co-cultures (16.3±1.3 cm/s, p< 0.001) and did not differ from controls (p = NS). Cme of pASC reduced CV in control monolayers of NRVM (10.3±1.1 cm/s, p<0.001), similar to Cme derived from pASC-loaded microspheres (11.1±1.7 cm/s, p = 1.0). The presence of microspheres in monolayers of NRVM abolished the CV slowing influence of Cme pASC (15.9±1.0 cm/s, p = NS vs. control). Conclusion The application of recombinant human collagen-based microspheres mitigates indirect paracrine conduction slowing through interference with a secondary autocrine myocardial factor."

Previously our research group identified the CaPPZ1 gene in the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans and reported that the gene deletion had several important physiological consequences. In order to reveal the protein targets and the associated mechanisms behind the functions of the phosphatase a proteomic method was adopted for the comparison of the cappz1 deletion mutant and the genetically matching QMY23 control strain. Proteins extracted from the control and deletion mutant strains were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the protein spots were stained with RuBPS and Pro-Q Diamond in order to visualize the total proteome and the phosphoproteome, respectively. The alterations in spot intensities were determined by densitometry and were analysed with the Delta2D (Decodon) software. Spots showing significantly different intensities between the mutant and control strains were excised from the gels and were digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were identified by LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry. As many as 15 protein spots were found that exhibited significant changes in their intensity upon the deletion of the phosphatase and 20 phosphoproteins were identified in which the level of phosphorylation was modified significantly in the mutant. In agreement with previous findings we found that the affected proteins function in protein synthesis, oxidative stress response, regulation of morphology and metabolism. Among these proteins we identified two potential CaPpz1 substrates (Eft2 and Rpp0) that may regulate the elongation step of translation. RT-qPCR experiments revealed that the expression of the genes coding for the affected proteins was not altered significantly. Thus, the absence of CaPpz1 exerted its effects via protein synthesis/degradation and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. In addition, our proteomics data strongly suggested a role for CaPpz1 in biofilm formation, was confirmed experimentally. Thus our unbiased proteomic approach lead to the discovery of a novel function for this phosphatase in C. albicans."
https://openalex.org/W2748746894,"Colouration has been considered a cue for mating success in many species; ornaments in males often are related to carotenoid mobilization towards feathers and/or skin and can signal general health and nutrition status. However, there are several factors that can also link with status, such as physiological blood parameters and body condition, but there is not substantial evidence which supports the existence of these relationships and interactions in anurans. This study evaluated how body score and blood values interact with colouration in free-range Agalychnis callidryas and Agalychnis annae males. We found significant associations between body condition and plasmatic proteins and haematocrit, as well as between body condition and colour values from the chromaticity diagram. We also demonstrated that there is a significant relation between the glucose and plasmatic protein values that were reflected in the ventral colours of the animals, and haematocrit inversely affected most of those colour values. Significant differences were found between species as well as between populations of A. callidryas, suggesting that despite colour variation, there are also biochemical differences within animals from the same species located in different regions. These data provide information on underlying factors for colouration of male tree frogs in nature, provide insights about the dynamics of several nutrients in the amphibian model and how this could affect the reproductive output of the animals."

It has been reported that the infusion of FVIII concentrate in haemophilia A patients results in lowered VWF plasma levels. However, the impact of F8-deficiency on VWF plasma levels in F8-/y mice is unresolved. In order to avoid confounding variables, we back-crossed F8-deficient mice onto a pure C57BL/6J background and analysed VWF plasma concentrations relative to C57BL/6J WT (F8+/y) littermate controls. F8-/y mice showed strongly elevated VWF plasma concentrations and signs of hepatic inflammation, as indicated by increased TNF-α, CD45, and TLR4 transcripts and by elevated macrophage counts in the liver. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry showed that expression of VWF antigen was significantly enhanced in the hepatic endothelium of F8-/y mice, most likely resulting from increased macrophage recruitment. There were no signs of liver damage, as judged by glutamate-pyruvate-transaminase (GPT) and glutamate-oxalacetate-transaminase (GOT) in the plasma and no signs of systemic inflammation, as white blood cell subsets were unchanged. As expected, impaired haemostasis was reflected by joint bleeding, prolonged in vitro clotting time and decreased platelet-dependent thrombin generation. Our results point towards a novel role of FVIII, synthesized by the liver endothelium, in the control of hepatic low-grade inflammation and VWF plasma levels."

Elevated levels of LL-37 have been linked to cell death and inflammatory diseases, such as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are polysaccharides that are found on respiratory epithelial cells and serve important roles in mucosal surface repair. Recent findings suggest that a synthetic glycosaminoglycan (GM-0111) can protect against LL-37-induced sinonasal mucosal inflammation and cell death in a murine model of acute RS. Herein, we elucidated the mechanisms by which LL-37 causes sinonasal inflammation and how GM-0111 can prevent these mechanisms. When challenged with LL-37, human nasal epithelial cells (HNEpCs) and mouse macrophages (J774.2) demonstrated increased release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and interleukin (IL)-6 and -8, as well as cell death and lysis. These cellular responses were all blocked dose-dependently by pre-treatment with GM-0111. We identified that LL-37-induced cell death is associated with caspase-1 and -8 activation, but not activation of caspase-3/7. These responses were again blocked by GM-0111. Our data suggest that LL-37 causes cellular death of HNEpCs and macrophages through the pro-inflammatory necrotic and/or pyroptotic pathways rather than apoptosis, and that a GM-0111 is capable of inhibiting these pro-inflammatory cellular events."

Also, patients' capacity to work and work readiness (Yes/No) was assessed with the Work Readiness Questionnaire. We categorized patients, irrespective of treatment, by work readiness at baseline and week 28: No to Yes (n = 41), Yes to Yes (n = 49), or No at week 28 (n = 118). Quality-of-Life Scale total, domains, and item scores were assessed with a mixed model of repeated measures. Patients who shifted from No to Yes in work readiness showed robust improvements on Quality-of-Life Scale total scores, significantly greater than patients not ready to work at week 28 (least squares mean difference: 11.6±2.6, p<0.0001). Scores on Quality-of-Life Scale instrumental role domain and items therein-occupational role, work functioning, work levels, work satisfaction-significantly improved in patients shifting from No to Yes in work readiness (vs patients No at Week 28). Quality-of-Life Scale total scores also significantly predicted work readiness at week 28. Overall, these results highlight a strong association between improvements in health-related quality of life and work readiness, and suggest that increasing patients' capacity to work is an achievable and meaningful goal in the treatment of impaired functioning in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2749283974,"Prevalence of influenza A virus (IAV) infections in northern-breeding waterfowl has previously been reported to reach an annual peak during late summer or autumn; however, little is known about IAV infection dynamics in waterfowl populations persisting at high-latitude regions such as Alaska, during winter. We captured mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) throughout the non-breeding season (August–April) of 2012–2015 in Fairbanks and Anchorage, the two largest cities in Alaska, to assess patterns of IAV infection and antibody production using molecular methods and a standard serologic assay. In addition, we used virus isolation, genetic sequencing, and a virus microneutralization assay to characterize viral subtypes and to evaluate the immune response of mallards captured on multiple occasions through time. We captured 923 mallards during three successive sampling years: Fairbanks in 2012/13 and 2013/14, and Anchorage in 2014/15. Prevalence varied by age, season, and year/site with high and relatively stable estimates throughout the non-breeding season. Infected birds were detected in all locations/seasons except early-winter in Fairbanks during 2013/14. IAVs with 17 combinations of hemagglutinin (H1–5, H7–9, H11, H12) and neuraminidase (N1–6, N8, N9) subtypes were isolated. Antibodies to IAVs were detected throughout autumn and winter for all sampling locations and years, however, seroprevalence was higher among adults and varied among years. Mallards exhibited individual heterogeneity with regard to immune response, providing instances of both seroconversion and seroreversion to detected viral subtypes. The probability that an individual transitioned from one serostatus to another varied by age, with juvenile mallards having higher rates of seroconversion and seroreversion than adults. Our study provides evidence that a diversity of IAVs circulate in populations of mallards wintering at urban locations in Alaska, and we suggest waterfowl wintering at high-latitudes may play an important role in maintenance of viruses across breeding seasons."
https://openalex.org/W2742978482,"Background We have analysed large data sets consisting of tens of thousands of time series from three Type B laser systems: a semiconductor laser in a photonic integrated chip, a semiconductor laser subject to optical feedback from a long free-space-external-cavity, and a solid-state laser subject to optical injection from a master laser. The lasers can deliver either constant, periodic, pulsed, or chaotic outputs when parameters such as the injection current and the level of external perturbation are varied. The systems represent examples of experimental nonlinear systems more generally and cover a broad range of complexity including systematically varying complexity in some regions. Methods In this work we have introduced a new procedure for semi-automatically interrogating experimental laser system output power time series to calculate the correlation dimension (CD) using the commonly adopted Grassberger-Proccacia algorithm. The new CD procedure is called the ‘minimum gradient detection algorithm’. A value of minimum gradient is returned for all time series in a data set. In some cases this can be identified as a CD, with uncertainty. Findings Applying the new ‘minimum gradient detection algorithm’ CD procedure, we obtained robust measurements of the correlation dimension for many of the time series measured from each laser system. By mapping the results across an extended parameter space for operation of each laser system, we were able to confidently identify regions of low CD (CD < 3) and assign these robust values for the correlation dimension. However, in all three laser systems, we were not able to measure the correlation dimension at all parts of the parameter space. Nevertheless, by mapping the staged progress of the algorithm, we were able to broadly classify the dynamical output of the lasers at all parts of their respective parameter spaces. For two of the laser systems this included displaying regions of high-complexity chaos and dynamic noise. These high-complexity regions are differentiated from regions where the time series are dominated by technical noise. This is the first time such differentiation has been achieved using a CD analysis approach. Conclusions More can be known of the CD for a system when it is interrogated in a mapping context, than from calculations using isolated time series. This has been shown for three laser systems and the approach is expected to be useful in other areas of nonlinear science where large data sets are available and need to be semi-automatically analysed to provide real dimensional information about the complex dynamics. The CD/minimum gradient algorithm measure provides additional information that complements other measures of complexity and relative complexity, such as the permutation entropy; and conventional physical measurements."

Regardless of the biocatalyst applied, the δ-iodo- and δ-bromo-γ-lactones were hydroxylated in an inactivated position C-5 of cyclohexane ring. The analogous transformation of chlorolactone was observed in Mortierella isabellina AM212 culture but in the case of two other biocatalysts the hydroxy group was introduced at C-3 position. All obtained hydroxylactones were enantiomerically pure (ee = 100%) or enriched (ee = 50%). The highest enantioselectivity of hydroxylation was observed for M. isabellina AM212. The cytotoxic activity of halolactones was also examined by WST-1 assay wherein tested compounds did not exhibit significant effect on the viability of tumor HeLa and normal CHO-K1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2746927811,"Aim Rare variants of genes encoding the cardiac sodium channel and associated compounds have been linked with atrial fibrillation (AF). Nevertheless, current expert consensus does not support genetic testing in AF, which is in part based on the fact that “there is no therapeutic impact derived from AF genetic test results”. However, there are no studies available supporting this recommendation. Consequently, this study analyzed the impact of rare variants affecting the cardiac sodium channel on rhythm outcome of AF catheter ablation. Methods and results In 137 consecutive patients with lone AF enrolled in the Leipzig Heart Center AF ablation registry, screening for mutations in SCN5A, SCN1B – 4B, CAV3, GPD1L, SNTA1 and MOG1 was performed. We identified 3 rare non-synonymous variants in SCN5A, 5 in SCN1B, 1 in SCN4B, 1 in CAV3, 6 in GPD1L, 3 in SNTA1 and 3 in MOG1 (16%). Variant carriers were otherwise comparable with non-variant carriers. Analysis of AF recurrence rates after radiofrequency AF catheter ablation by serial 7-day Holter ECG monitoring between 3 and 12 months revealed no difference between groups, i.e. 45% in variant carriers vs. 49% in non-variant carriers. Conclusions Rare variants in genes encoding the cardiac sodium channel and associated compounds are frequently found in lone AF but were not found to impact the outcome of AF catheter ablation. This finding supports current recommendations not to screen for rare variants for the ablation outcome in AF. Nevertheless, it may at least be helpful for understanding AF mechanisms and larger studies are needed to further explore the possible association between genotype and response to AF therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2748625300,"Knowing which specific verbal techniques ""good"" therapists use in their daily work is important for training and evaluation purposes. In order to systematize what is being practiced in the field, our aim was to empirically identify verbal techniques applied in psychodynamic sessions and to differentiate them according to their basic semantic features using a bottom-up, qualitative approach.Mixed-Method-Design: In a comprehensive qualitative study, types of techniques were identified at the level of utterances based on transcribed psychodynamic therapy sessions using Qualitative Content Analysis (4211 utterances). The definitions of the identified categories were successively refined and modified until saturation was achieved. In a subsequent quantitative study, inter-rater reliability was assessed both at the level of utterances (n = 8717) and at the session level (n = 38). The convergent validity of the categories was investigated by analyzing associations with the Interpretive and Supportive Technique Scale (ISTS).The inductive approach resulted in a classification system with 37 categories (Psychodynamic Interventions List, PIL). According to their semantic content, the categories can be allocated to three dimensions: form (24 categories), thematic content (9) and temporal focus (4). Most categories showed good or excellent inter-rater reliability and expected associations with the ISTS were predominantly confirmed. The rare use of the residual category ""Other"" suggests that the identified categories might comprehensively describe the breadth of applied techniques.The atheoretical orientation and the clear focus on overt linguistic features should enable the PIL to be used without intensive training or prior theoretical knowledge. The PIL can be used to investigate the links between verbal techniques derived from practice and micro-outcomes (at the session level) as well as the overall therapeutic outcomes. This approach might enable us to determine to what extent the outcome of therapy is due to unintended or non-theoretically relevant techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2750052965,"Purpose A comprehensive and representative nationwide general practice database was explored to study associations between atopic disorders and prescribed medication in children. Method All children aged 0–18 years listed in the NIVEL Primary Care Database in 2014 were selected. Atopic children with atopic eczema, asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR) were matched with controls (not diagnosed with any of these disorders) within the same general practice on age and gender. Logistic regression analyses were performed to study the differences in prescribed medication between both groups by calculating odds ratios (OR); 93 different medication groups were studied. Results A total of 45,964 children with at least one atopic disorder were identified and matched with controls. Disorder-specific prescriptions seem to reflect evidence-based medicine guidelines for atopic eczema, asthma and AR. However, these disorder-specific prescriptions were also prescribed for children who were not registered as having that specific disorder. For eczema-related medication, about 3.7–8.4% of the children with non-eczematous atopic morbidity received these prescriptions, compared to 1.4–3.5% of the non-atopic children. The same pattern was observed for anti-asthmatics (having non-asthmatic atopic morbidity: 0.8–6.2% vs. controls: 0.3–2.1%) and AR-related medication (having non-AR atopic morbidity: 4.7–12.5% vs. controls: 2.8–3.1%). Also, non-atopic related medication, such as laxatives and antibiotics were more frequently prescribed for atopic children. Conclusions The present study shows that atopic children received more prescriptions, compared to non-atopic children. Non-atopic controls frequently received specific prescriptions for atopic disorders. This indicates that children with atopic disorders need better monitoring by their GP."
https://openalex.org/W2747275544,"Objective To analyze the midterm evaluation data from the National Syphilis Prevention and Control Plan (2010–2020) and evaluate the current status of syphilis prevention and control in Jiangsu province, China. Methods We collected data via (1) field surveys conducted in 2015 and (2) data recorded in existing syphilis surveillance systems. We conducted descriptive statistical analysis to evaluate the current landscape of syphilis control initiatives and their potential effect in syphilis control. Results The incidence of all cases of syphilis decreased from 2010 (32.3 per 100,000) to 2015 (30.1 per 100,000), with an annual growth of -1.17% (x2trend = -7.52, P<0.001) in Jiangsu province. The incidence of primary and secondary syphilis and congenital syphilis both decreased significantly from 2010 to 2015. The average awareness rate of syphilis knowledge among professional personnel was 95.4% (3781/3963). Rural residents had the lowest awareness rate (83.5%, 1875/2245) and commercial sex workers had the highest awareness rate (92.1%, 7804/8474) in 2015. Only 47.8% (33908/70894) of patients received provider-initiated syphilis counseling and testing (PISTC) services in sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics, but 94.5% (87927/93020) of all syphilis patients received free testing for syphilis. Overall, 97.2% (9378/9648) of syphilis reported cases of syphilis at medical institutions were confirmed to be accurate, and 92.2% (5850/6345) of patients diagnosed with syphilis at medical institutions received treatment with penicillin. Conclusion The syphilis incidence rate in Jiangsu has decreased in recent years, but remains at a high level. It is essential to promote PISTC services to improve knowledge of syphilis and rates of testing and treatment in Jiangsu province."
https://openalex.org/W2747798162,"The GW182/TNRC6 family of proteins are central scaffolds that link microRNA-associated Argonaute proteins to the cytoplasmic decay machinery for targeted mRNA degradation processes. Although nuclear roles for the GW182/TNRC6 proteins are unknown, recent reports have demonstrated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity that utilises the importin-α and importin-β transport receptors for nuclear translocation. Here we describe the structure of mouse importin-α in complex with the TNRC6A nuclear localisation signal peptide. We further show that the interactions observed between TNRC6A and importin-α are conserved between mouse and human complexes. Our results highlight the ability of monopartite cNLS sequences to maximise contacts at the importin-α major binding site, as well as regions outside the main binding cavities."
https://openalex.org/W2750268638,"Background Vaccination is the best measure to prevent influenza. We conducted a cost-effectiveness evaluation of trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccination, compared to no vaccination, in children ≤60 months of age participating in a prospective cohort study in Bangkok, Thailand. Methods A static decision tree model was constructed to simulate the population of children in the cohort. Proportions of children with laboratory-confirmed influenza were derived from children followed weekly. The societal perspective and one-year analytic horizon were used for each influenza season; the model was repeated for three influenza seasons (2012–2014). Direct and indirect costs associated with influenza illness were collected and summed. Cost of the trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (IIV3) including promotion, administration, and supervision cost was added for children who were vaccinated. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY), derived from literature, were used to quantify health outcomes. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as the difference in the expected total costs between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups divided by the difference in QALYs for both groups. Results Compared to no vaccination, IIV3 vaccination among children ≤60 months in our cohort was not cost-effective in the introductory year (2012 season; 24,450 USD/QALY gained), highly cost-effective in the 2013 season (554 USD/QALY gained), and cost-effective in the 2014 season (16,200 USD/QALY gained). Conclusion The cost-effectiveness of IIV3 vaccination among children participating in the cohort study varied by influenza season, with vaccine cost and proportion of high-risk children demonstrating the greatest influence in sensitivity analyses. Vaccinating children against influenza can be economically favorable depending on the maturity of the program, influenza vaccine performance, and target population."
https://openalex.org/W2749840099,"The salamander axolotl is capable of complete regeneration of amputated heart tissue. However, non-invasive imaging tools for assessing its cardiac function were so far not employed. In this study, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is introduced as a non-invasive technique to image heart function of axolotls. Three axolotls were imaged with magnetic resonance imaging using a retrospectively gated Fast Low Angle Shot cine sequence. Within one scanning session the axolotl heart was imaged three times in all planes, consecutively. Heart rate, ejection fraction, stroke volume and cardiac output were calculated using three techniques: (1) combined long-axis, (2) short-axis series, and (3) ultrasound (control for heart rate only). All values are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Heart rate (beats per minute) among different animals was 32.2±6.0 (long axis), 30.4±5.5 (short axis) and 32.7±4.9 (ultrasound) and statistically similar regardless of the imaging method (p > 0.05). Ejection fraction (%) was 59.6±10.8 (long axis) and 48.1±11.3 (short axis) and it differed significantly (p = 0.019). Stroke volume (μl/beat) was 133.7±33.7 (long axis) and 93.2±31.2 (short axis), also differed significantly (p = 0.015). Calculations were consistent among the animals and over three repeated measurements. The heart rate varied depending on depth of anaesthesia. We described a new method for defining and imaging the anatomical planes of the axolotl heart and propose one of our techniques (long axis analysis) may prove useful in defining cardiac function in regenerating axolotl hearts."
https://openalex.org/W2749393852,"Extranodal spread (ENS) in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) can greatly influence the prognostic outcomes. However, the relative risks of ENS in the primary (1st) and secondary (2nd) metastatic nodes (mets) are not well documented. We retrospectively analyzed the hazard ratios (HRs) of ENS in the 1st and 2nd mets from 516 HNSCC patients who had undergone primary tumor excision. The impact of clinically and/or histologically confirmed ENS-positive mets on prognosis in terms of cancer-specific survival was analyzed. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis indicated that ENS-positive 1st met (adjusted HR = 3.15; 95% CI, 1.40–7.56; p = 0.006) and ENS-positive 2nd met (adjusted HR = 4.03; 95% CI, 1.41–16.96; p = 0.007) significantly and independently predicted poor prognosis; however, other variables including primary site, met size or numbers, and met location in the contralateral side of the primary lesion, did not. Cumulative incidence function and Cox analyses indicated that differences in ENS profiles of 1st and 2nd mets stratified HNSCC patients with varying risks of poor outcome; HRs relative to patients with ENS-positive 1st met (-)/ENS-positive 2nd met (-) were 4.02 (95% CI, 1.78–8.24; p = 0.002), 8.29 (95% CI, 4.58–14.76; p <0.001), and 25.80 (95% CI, 10.15–57.69; p <0.001) for patients with ENS-positive 1st met (+)/ENS-positive 2nd met (-), ENS-positive 1st met (-)/ENS-positive 2nd met (+), and ENS-positive 1st met (+)/ENS-positive 2nd met (+) patients, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the 2nd met that appeared in the neck side with a history of 1st met and neck dissection had a higher risk of ENS than the 2nd met in the neck side without the history (p = 0.003). These results suggested that ENS is a dominant prognostic predictor of HNSCC patients, with double-positive ENS in the 1st and 2nd mets predicting the most devastating outcome."
