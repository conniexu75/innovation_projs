https://openalex.org/W1975913162,"Deep ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is shown to modify organosilane self-assembled monolayer (SAM) films by a photocleavage mechanism, which renders the surface amenable to further SAM modification. Patterned UV exposure creates alternating regions of intact SAM film and hydrophilic, reactive sites. The exposed regions can undergo a second chemisorption reaction to produce an assembly of SAMs in the same molecular plane with similar substrate attachment chemistry. The UV-patterned films are used as a template for selective buildup of fluorophores, metals, and biological cells."
https://openalex.org/W2146768805,"The sterol storage disorder cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is characterized by abnormal deposition of cholesterol and cholestanol in multiple tissues. Deposition in the central nervous system leads to neurological dysfunction marked by dementia, spinal cord paresis, and cerebellar ataxia. Deposition in other tissues causes tendon xanthomas, premature atherosclerosis, and cataracts. In two unrelated patients with CTX, we have identified different point mutations in the gene (CYP27) encoding sterol 27-hydroxylase, a key enzyme in the bile acid biosynthesis pathway. Transfection of mutant cDNAs into cultured cells results in the synthesis of immunoreactive sterol 27-hydroxylase protein with greatly diminished enzyme activity. We have localized the CYP27 gene to the q33-qter interval of human chromosome 2, and to mouse chromosome 1, in agreement with the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of CTX. These findings underscore the essential role played by sterols in the central nervous system and suggest that mutations in other sterol metabolizing enzymes may contribute to diseases with neurological manifestations."
https://openalex.org/W1589237240,"In this report we describe the biochemical characterization of neutrophil and monocyte p8 and p14. Together the two proteins comprise approximately 45% of cytosolic protein in neutrophils and approximately 40-fold less in monocytes. They fractionated together in several chromatographic procedures and were found to exist as a noncovalently associated complex with a stoichiometry of 1:1, named p8,14. Cross-linking experiments showed p8,14 to form heterodimers under conditions simulating the cytosol. An apparent molecular mass of 35,000 daltons was obtained for the p8,14 complex in molecular sizing experiments which suggests the presence of modifications or distinctive structural features. Two major forms of p14 can be identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, both of which form heterodimers with p8. The lower molecular weight variant of p14 lacks Cys-3 (Met-Thr-Cys-Lys-Met...) suggesting that differing translational start sites account for these two forms of p14. A protocol has been devised for the rapid purification of milligram quantities of p8 and p14 from neutrophil cytosol using fast-protein liquid chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1565210265,"Glucocorticoid receptors in vivo are phosphorylated in the absence of hormone and become hyperphosphorylated in the presence of glucocorticoid agonist but not antagonists (Orti, E., Mendel, D.B., Smith, L.I., and Munck, A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9728-9731). As a preliminary step to elucidating the functional significance of receptor phosphorylation, we have identified seven phosphorylated sites on the mouse receptor. Tryptic phosphopeptides from 32P-labeled receptors were purified from glucocorticoid-treated mouse thymoma cells (WEHI-7) and from stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (WCL2) that express large numbers of mouse receptors. Phosphopeptide maps of receptors from these two cell types were almost indistinguishable. Solid phase sequencing revealed phosphorylation at serines 122, 150, 212, 220, 234, and 315 and threonine 159. Serines 122, 150, 212, 220, and 234 and the sequences surrounding them are conserved in the homologous regions of the rat and human receptors, but threonine 159 and serine 315 have no homologues in the human receptor. The seven phosphorylated sites are in the amino-terminal domain of the receptor. All but serine 315 are within transactivation domains identified in the human and/or rat receptors. Serines 212, 220, and 234 are in a highly acidic region that in the mouse receptor is necessary for full transcription initiation activity and reduces nonspecific DNA binding. Serines 212, 220, and 234 and threonine 159 are in consensus sequences for proline-directed kinase and/or p34cdc2 kinase. Serine 122 is in a consensus sequence for casein kinase II whereas serines 150 and 315 do not appear to be in any known kinase consensus sequence. The location of many of these sites suggests a role of phosphorylation in transactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1596955093,"Insulin stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 185-kDa putative cytosolic substrate protein (pp185) in diverse cell types. After intravenous insulin infusion into the live intact rat, pp185 and the 95-kDa insulin receptor beta-subunit were the major proteins that tyrosine phosphorylated in liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Both proteins were maximally phosphorylated within 30 s, and both increased in phosphotyrosine content in parallel with increasing insulin dose. However, pp185 tyrosine phosphorylation was transient, with almost complete dephosphorylation within 2-3 min despite continued insulin stimulation. To identify pp185 directly, we purified pp185 from insulin-stimulated rat liver, using a denaturation-based extraction procedure that blocks endogenous protein phosphatases and thus allows a high yield, single step isolation of phosphotyrosyl proteins by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody immunoaffinity absorption. From 50 rat livers, 50-100 pmol of pp185 was isolated. Edman degradation of seven internal tryptic peptide fragments of pp185 yielded novel amino acid sequences, indicating that pp185 is a new protein. Antipeptide antibodies were raised which specifically recognize a single, 185-kDa insulin-stimulated phosphotyrosyl protein in liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and several cultured cell lines. These results indicate that pp185 is expressed in a variety of insulin-responsive tissues, is the major protein rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated under physiological conditions in the intact animal, and also provide a route for cloning the pp185 gene and elucidating the function of pp185 in insulin signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1503589713,"Photosystem (PS) II membranes, obtained by the method of Berthold et al. (Berthold, D. A., Babcock, G. T., and Yocum, C. F. (1981) FEBS Lett. 134, 231-234), have been fractionated by a sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation method which allows the quantitative separation of the three major chlorophyll binding complexes in these membranes: the chlorophyll (chl) a binding PSII reaction center core, the major light-harvesting complex II, and the minor chl a/b proteins called CP26, CP29, and CP24. Each fraction has been analyzed for its subunit stoichiometry by quantitative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis methods. The results show that 12 mol of light-harvesting complex II and 1.5 mol of each of the minor chl a/b proteins are present per mol of the PSII reaction center complex in PSII membranes. These data suggest a dimeric organization of PSII, in agreement with a recent crystallographic study (Bassi, R., Ghiretti Magaldi, A., Tognon, G., Giacometti, G. M., and Miller, K. (1989) Eur. J. Cell Biol. 50, 84-93) and imply that such a dimeric complex is served by antenna chl a/b proteins whose minimal aggregation state includes three polypeptides. This was confirmed by covalent cross-linking of purified antenna complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1558451333,"We have identified the major site required for the interaction of fibronectin (FN) with heparin. Affinity chromatography was used to test the binding ability of a library of truncated, monomeric forms of fibronectin (deminectins) containing deletions or two point mutations in the heparin-binding domain. This domain consists of type III repeats 12, 13, and 14. Deletions of individual repeats showed that both III13 and III14 are required for complete binding. Small deletions within these repeats localized a major site of heparin interaction to the amino-terminal half of III13. Site-directed mutagenesis of adjacent arginines within this sequence to uncharged residues reduced heparin binding by 98%, identifying these positively charged amino acids as essential for the interaction. A significant role for the flanking alternatively spliced regions and for repeat III12 was not found. We conclude that, while both repeats III13 and III14 participate in heparin binding, there is a major site of interaction in repeat III13 that accounts for nearly all of the activity. The significance of multiple heparin-binding sites within this domain is discussed and a model is proposed to account for how these sites may function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1535902137,"Extracellular tetraethylammonium (TEA) inhibits currents in Xenopus oocytes that have been injected with mRNAs encoding voltage-dependent potassium channels. Concentration-response curves were used to measure the affinity of TEA; this differed up to 700-fold among channels RBK1 (KD 0.3 mM), RGK5 (KD 11 mM), and RBK2 (KD greater than 200 mM). Studies in which chimeric channels were expressed localized TEA binding to the putative extracellular loop between trans-membrane domains S5 and S6. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues in this region identified the residue Tyr379 of RBK1 as a crucial determinant of TEA sensitivity; substitution of Tyr in the equivalent positions of RBK2 (Val381) and RGK5 (His401) made these channels as sensitive to TEA as RBK1. Nonionic forces are involved in TEA binding because (i) substitution of the Phe for Tyr379 in RBK1 increased its affinity, (ii) protonation of His401 in RGK5 selectively reduced its affinity, and (iii) the affinity of TEA was unaffected by changes in ionic strength. The results suggest an explanation for the marked differences in TEA sensitivity that have been observed among naturally occurring and cloned potassium channels and indicate that the amino acid corresponding to residue 379 in RBK1 lies within the external mouth of the ion channel."
https://openalex.org/W1544502122,"Protein 4.1, a multifunctional structural protein originally described as an 80-kDa component of the erythroid membrane skeleton, exhibits tissue- and development-specific heterogeneity in molecular weight, subcellular localization, and primary amino acid sequence. Earlier reports suggested that some of this impressive heterogeneity is generated by RNA splicing (Conboy, J. G., Chan, J., Mohandas, N., and Kan, Y. W. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 9062-9065; Tang, T. K., Leto, T., Marchesi, V. T., and Benz, E. J. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 110, 617-624). We have now completed a systematic analysis of 4.1 mRNA isoforms expressed in erythroid cells, and have generated an alternative splicing map which summarizes diagrammatically a multitude of polypeptide isoforms potentially generated by combinatorial splicing of nine exons. Complex 5' splicing events yield mRNA isoforms that may initiate translation at different sites and thus generate elongated or truncated NH2 termini; elongated approximately 135-kDa and prototypical approximately 80-kDa species were detected in both erythrocytes and T-lymphocytes, but in very different ratios. Among the functional domains of 4.1 responsible for interaction with other membrane skeletal elements, four variants of the 10-kDa spectrin-actin-binding region and four variants of the putative 30-kDa glycophorin-binding region are predicted. Developmentally controlled RNA splicing in the spectrin-actin-binding region may help regulate remodeling of membrane architecture and mechanical properties that occur during erythropoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W1665409553,"Nucleolin is the major nucleolar phosphoprotein of exponentially growing eukaryotic cells and is presumably involved in pre-rRNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis. Monoclonal antibodies against nucleolin were selected by a differential dot-immunobinding assay. Nucleolin expression during T lymphocyte activation was monitored by the specific antibody. Results showed that nucleolin fluctuated in parallel to DNA synthesis. The intact 105-kDa nucleolin molecule was the major species in actively dividing cells, whereas the degraded forms were relatively abundant in nondividing cells. These results imply that stability of nucleolin molecule is cell proliferation-dependent. When affinity purified nucleolin containing undetectable contaminants was incubated at 37 degrees C, the majority of 105-kDa nucleolin was cleaved by 6 h and completely degraded within 24 h. This purified nucleolin was further separated from possible copurified protease, if any, on a reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. After renaturation, the 105-kDa nucleolin immobilized in the gel was also cleaved at 37 degrees C. These data have confirmed that nucleolin protein autocatalyzes its own degradation. The self-cleaving activity of nucleolin was inhibited by nuclear extracts prepared from proliferating cells. Apparently, a proteolytic inhibitor(s) in the nuclei of proliferating cells stabilized the nucleolin molecule. It provides an unique regulatory mechanism for nucleolin expression."
https://openalex.org/W2133326826,"Ristocetin in aqueous solution dimerizes with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 5.0 x 10(-4) M, i.e. approximately 1.1 mg ml-1 (Waltho, J.P., and Williams, D. H. (1989) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111, 2475-2480). At concentrations of about 1.0 mg ml-1 ristocetin flocculates many proteins, lyses platelets and, in the presence of von Willebrand factor, agglutinates both fresh and formalin-fixed platelets. Because ristocetin exists as both monomeric and dimeric species, we sought to determine which of these forms flocculates proteins and agglutinates platelets. We found that: 1) the initial rate of flocculation of certain proteins, 2) the initial rate of agglutination of formalin-fixed platelets, and 3) the binding of ristocetin to formalin-fixed platelets are higher order solely with respect to the concentration of ristocetin dimers. As to the operative mechanism, it appears that bifunctional dimers cross-link proteins that possess multiple copies of a common recognition site. Preliminary evidence indicates that a recognition site is a beta-turn of the form X-P-G-X'."
https://openalex.org/W2141189073,"Brefeldin A, a fungal metabolite which interrupts trafficking of proteins via the Golgi by causing disassembly of the Golgi stacks, has been used to investigate the mechanism of movement of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) from its sites of synthesis to the cell surface. PtdEtn is made in hepatocytes by two major pathways, (a) from CDP-ethanolamine on the endoplasmic reticulum and (b) by decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine in mitochondria. Monolayer cultures of rat hepatocytes were incubated with radiolabeled precursors of PtdEtn ([3H]ethanolamine or [3H]serine) in the presence or absence of brefeldin A. The movement of newly made PtdEtn to the plasma membrane was studied by treatment of intact cells with trinitrobenzene sulfonate which reacted only with PtdEtn on the outside surface of the cells to produce N-trinitrophenyl-PtdEtn; PtdEtn in intracellular membranes remained underivatized by this reagent. Using this method, the incorporation of radioactivity into cell surface and intracellular PtdEtn could be differentiated. The studies showed that PtdEtn made by the two different biosynthetic routes was rapidly transported to the outside leaflet of the plasma membrane. However, the kinetics and the extent of labeling of the cell surface PtdEtn, relative to that of the intracellular PtdEtn pool, were different from each labeled precursor. The incorporation of [3H]ethanolamine into PtdEtn on the cell surface gradually increased to a constant level of 1.8% of the label of intracellular PtdEtn after 3 h. In contrast, after 0.5-1 h, cell surface PtdEtn labeled from [3H]serine comprised 4% of the intracellular PtdEtn pool; the extent of labeling gradually declined to a constant level of approximately 2.4% by 3 h. Brefeldin A did not interrupt the movement of PtdEtn, derived from either biosynthetic origin, to the cell surface even though protein secretion was greatly reduced. Thus, apparently PtdEtn and proteins are independently transported to the cell surface of hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1529030015,"The remodeling pathway for the biosynthesis of platelet-activating factor (PAF) consists of the following reaction sequence: alkylacylglycerophosphocholine—-lyso-PAF—-PAF. Results presented in this article describe a novel transacylase activity that generates the lyso-PAF intermediate, which can then be acetylated to form PAF. Ethanolamine-containing lysoplasmalogens, 1-acyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, alkyllysophosphoethanolamine, unlabeled lyso-PAF, 1-acyl-2-lyso-GPC, where GPC is sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and choline-containing lysoplasmalogens were all able to stimulate the formation of [3H]lyso-PAF from a [3H]alkylacyl-GPC precursor pool associated with HL-60 cell (granulocytic type) membranes. Other glycerolipids containing free hydroxyl groups (3-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-1-phosphocholine, lysophosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylinositol, diacylglycerols, alkylglycerols, and monoacylglycerols), cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine had no stimulatory effect on the release of [3H]lyso-PAF from the prelabeled membranes under identical incubation conditions. The observed transacylase reaction is directly coupled to PAF production, since the addition of a lysoethanolamine plasmalogen preparation to HL-60 membranes in the presence of [14C]acetyl-CoA stimulated PAF formation; under these conditions the lysoethanolamine plasmalogen was acylated. The transacylase responsible for the release of lyso-PAF from the membrane-associated alkylacyl-GPC was not affected by Ca2+, EGTA, or a known phospholipase A2 inhibitor, p-bromophenacyl bromide. The fact that the unnatural analog of lyso-PAF, lysophosphatidylserine, and lysophosphatidylinositol did not influence transacylase activity, whereas detergents such as deoxycholate and Triton X-100 inhibited the activity, demonstrated the observed stimulatory effects of the choline- and ethanolamine-containing lysophospholipids on the formation of [3H]lyso-PAF from [3H]alkylacyl-GPC were not due to any detergent property of these lysophospholipids. Thus, we conclude a CoA-independent transacylase (possessing phospholipase A2/acyltransferase activities) can be responsible for the formation of the lyso-PAF intermediate in the remodeling route of PAF biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1536491178,"In order to better understand the cellular delivery of iron from serum transferrin (Tf), we compared iron release from receptor-bound and free Tf. While free Tf did not release all iron until below pH 4.6, receptor-bound Tf released significantly more iron at mildly acidic pH, with essentially all iron released between pH 5.6 and 6.0. Since Tf is acidified to a minimum pH of 5.4 in K562 cells, this result accounts for the nearly complete extraction of iron from Tf by these cells. Comparison of fluorescence from Tf conjugated with lissamine rhodamine sulfonyl chloride (LRSC-Tf) free in solution and bound to receptor provides further evidence that the Tf receptor modulates low pH-mediated conformational changes in Tf. As pH was decreased from neutrality, the fluorescence of free LRSC-Tf began to increase below pH 6.2; the fluorescence of LRSC-Tf bound to human receptors did not increase until below pH 5.6. Binding to the Tf receptor, while facilitating iron release from Tf, appears to partially inhibit a conformational change that causes the increase in LRSC-Tf fluorescence at low pH. The fluorescence of human LRSC-Tf bound to murine receptors increases at a higher pH, 6.0, indicating that there are differences in conformational stabilization of Tf by receptors of different species. The results suggest that the Tf receptor, in addition to providing a means by which cells may internalize Tf, functions to increase the release of iron from Tf in the endosome."
https://openalex.org/W1551728669,"Affinity-purified antibodies to microfibril-associated glycoprotein (MAGP) were used to screen a random-primed, bovine nuchal ligament cDNA library in lambda gt11. A 303-base pair clone, cM5, was isolated which encoded an amino acid sequence homologous with that determined directly from a Lys-C peptide of MAGP. A 936-base pair cDNA clone, cM32, was identified in an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library using plaque hybridization with clone cM5. Clone cM32 encoded amino acid sequences corresponding to sequences obtained from three Lys-C peptides of MAGP, indicating that the clone was an authentic cDNA for the glycoprotein. The cDNA coded for the entire MAGP polypeptide (21 kDa) of 183 amino acids including a putative signal peptide of 17-19 amino acids. This was confirmed by in vitro translation of synthetic mRNAs transcribed from cM32. The amino acid composition of the encoded protein was virtually identical to that previously published for MAGP. DNA sequence analysis of cM32 indicated that MAGP contains two structurally dissimilar regions, an amino-terminal domain containing high levels of glutamine, proline, and acidic amino acids and a carboxyl-terminal domain containing all 13 of the cysteine residues and most of the basic amino acids. Northern blot hybridization of poly(A+) RNA from fetal nuchal ligament with clone cM32 identified a single mRNA species for MAGP of approximately 1.1 kilobases. The evidence indicates that MAGP is a distinct component of 12-nm microfibrils and that it is not derived from a larger microfibrillar glycopolypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1499995013,"We have examined the effect of bradykinin (BK) and other peptide mediators with related cellular actions on tyrosine phosphorylation in confluent Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cells using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Immunoblots of extracts from cells stimulated with BK showed a major heterogeneous band centered at Mr 120,000. Three phosphorylated protein species were present within this band. The lower of these three phosphoproteins was occasionally present under basal conditions. The detection of this group of phosphoproteins by the antibody was prevented by coincubation with an excess of phosphotyrosine but not with an excess of phosphoserine or phosphothreonine. The BK-promoted increase in phosphorylation was rapid and transient with the peak response apparent following BK exposure for 1 min. The response was dose-dependent with half-maximal effect occurring at 10-30 nM BK. The antagonist Arg0, Hyp3, Thi5,8, D-Phe7-BK completely inhibited the response indicating that BK was acting via a B2 kinin receptor. Bombesin, at 0.1 microM, stimulated an increase in phosphorylation of the 120-kDa group of proteins with the same efficacy as 0.1 microM BK. On the other hand, 1 microM vasopressin was considerably less efficaceous than either of the former agonists. Short-term preexposure to 0.1 microM 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (1 min), a protein kinase C stimulator, or 30 microM H7 (15 min), a protein kinase C inhibitor, had no significant effect either on the basal or BK-promoted increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins. BK also stimulated inositol phosphate formation in these cells. Genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibited BK stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, genistein partially inhibited BK stimulation of inositol phosphate formation. These results show that an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a 120-kDa group of proteins is an early protein kinase C-independent cellular signal elicited by both bradykinin and bombesin."

Among these selenoproteins, an enzymatic activity is known only for the 22-kDa protein, since this protein has been identified as the monomer of glutathione peroxidase. However, all tested cell lines also contained a peroxidase activity with phospholipid hydroperoxides that is completely accounted for by the other selenoenzyme, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPX) (Ursini, F., Maiorino, M., and Gregolin, C. (1985) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 839, 62-70). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of 75Se-labeled proteins separated by gel permeation chromatography supported the identification of PHGPX as the monomeric protein matching the 18 kDa band. This paper is the first report on the identification of PHGPX in human cells."

A., Brombacher, F., Buchegger, F., von Kleist, S., and Zimmermann, W. (1990) Cancer Res. 50, 6534-6539) has been examined. Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the cDNA for W272, CEA, nonspecific cross-reacting antigen (NCA), and various antigens containing chimeric N-domain have been used. The W272 producers did not show homotypic binding at all but bound only to the cells expressing NCA and a chimeric CEA whose N-domain is substituted by that of NCA, indicating the major contribution of N-domain of NCA in the specific binding. The importance of the N-terminal region of NCA N-domain for the W272-NCA binding has been shown by detailed analysis using COS-1 cells producing various NCA whose N-domain are chimera of that of NCA and CEA. The strict heterotypic nature of the W272-NCA adhesion strongly suggests that the cell adhesion activities exhibited by CEA family members are not the fortuitous activity but the specific one which have some important physiological roles."
https://openalex.org/W1545007954,"The synthesis, translocation, and decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine can occur in a cell-free system (Voelker, D. R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8019-8025). We made use of the spatial separation of the site of biosynthesis and the site of decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine to demonstrate that mitochondrial contact sites are intimately involved in the translocation of phosphatidylserine prior to decarboxylation. In that sense, the inhibition of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase leads to an accumulation of this phospholipid in the contact site-enriched fractions without mixing the inner membrane phospholipid pool. On the other hand, newly synthesized phosphatidylethanolamine can be exported very rapidly to the mitochondrial surface in the same way, i.e. via contact sites. These data provide further evidence for the existence of a structural and functional microcompartmentation at the inner mitochondrial membrane surface."
https://openalex.org/W1511672090,"Chromogranin A, the major intravesicular protein of adrenal chromaffin granules, bound Ca2+ in a pH-dependent manner. Both the maximal binding and affinity of chromogranin A for Ca2+ were dependent on pH. Chromogranin A bound 670 nmol of Ca2+/mg (32 mol/mol) and 1150 nmol of Ca2+/mg (55 mol/mol) at pH 7.5 and 5.5, respectively, with dissociation constants (Kd) of 2.7 and 4 mM. This pH dependence probably reflects different conformations of the protein at the two pH values. Conformational differences of chromogranin A at two different pH values were demonstrated by limited tryptic digestion patterns confirming previous results obtained by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Yoo, S. H., and Albanesi, J. P. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14414-14421). Sedimentation equilibrium studies revealed the native molecular mass of chromogranin A to be 100 kDa at pH 7.5 and 192 kDa at pH 5.5, indicating dimeric and tetrameric states of the protein at the two pH levels. We postulate that the pH- and Ca2(+)-induced conformational changes of chromogranin A may have a role both in the regulation of Ca2+ release of chromaffin granules and in the early stages of secretory vesicle biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1606584123,"Last instar larvae of the insect armyworm, Pseudaletia separata, parasitized with the parasitoid wasp, Apanteles kariyai, do not initiate metamorphosis and, ultimately, the wasp larvae emerge from the host larvae about 10 days after parasitization (Tanaka, T., Agui, N., and Hiruma, K. (1987) Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 67, 364-374). It is necessary for the parasitoid wasp to perturb the armyworm's endocrinological processes that control normal metamorphosis from larvae to pupae. This endocrinological perturbation allows the parasitoid to complete its larval growth before emerging from the host larvae. It is obligatory for the parasitoid larvae to emerge while the host is still in a larval stage because the sclerotized pupal cuticle is impenetrable for the parasitoid larvae. A growth-blocking peptide with repressive activity against juvenile hormone esterase has been proven to exist in the parasitized host larval plasma (Hayakawa, Y. (1990) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1571688087,"We report the identification and characterization of tissue-specific transcriptional enhancer elements that influence the expression of the human apolipoprotein B gene. A 704-base pair PstI fragment comprising sequences from the first and second introns of the human apolipoprotein B gene (positions +360 to +1064) possesses tissue-specific transcriptional enhancer elements when assayed in transient transfection experiments using either the apolipoprotein B or thymidine kinase promoter. The majority of the enhancer activity, which was observed in transcriptionally active HepG2 and CaCo-2 cells, but not in transcriptionally inactive Chinese hamster ovary or HeLa cells, was subsequently localized to a 443-base pair SmaI-PvuII fragment (positions +621 to +1064) within the second intron of the apolipoprotein B gene. Gel retention experiments demonstrated that sequence motifs within this region interact with a number of nuclear proteins from HepG2, CaCo-2, and HeLa cells. The actual sequence elements that bound to nuclear proteins from HepG2 cells were identified by DNase I footprinting. Deletion experiments were performed to distinguish those protein-binding regions involved in the enhancer effect. Our data demonstrate that sequences between positions +806 and +940 are essential for this enhancer activity. This segment contains one large 97-base pair footprint, whose sequence has been conserved between the human and mouse genes. Binding sites for the liver-specific transcription factors HNF-1 and HNF-3 are present within this footprint."

With particular deletions, ges-1 was expressed, not as normally in the gut, but rather in muscle cells of the pharynx (which belong to a sister lineage of the gut) or in body wall muscle and hypodermal cells (which belong to a cousin lineage of the gut). These observations suggest that gut-specific gene expression in C. elegans involves not only gut-specific activators but also multiple repressors that are present in particular nongut lineages."
https://openalex.org/W1542515897,"Abstract The polymer modification process in the biosynthesis of heparin/heparan sulfate is initiated by N-deacetylation, followed by N-sulfation, of N-acetylglucosamine units. Chromatography of a detergent extract from mouse mastocytoma on wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose yielded a protein fraction, eluted with 0.3 M N-acetylglucosamine, that expressed N-deacetylase activity, but only after recombination with proteins that did not bind to the lectin column. In subsequent purification of the active lectin-bound component, all assays were performed following addition of the unbound protein fraction. After two additional chromatography steps, on blue Sepharose and 3',5'-ADP-agarose, the lectin-binding N-deacetylase component had been purified about 4300-fold with an 11% yield and showed essentially a single band, corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of approximately 110,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analysis of the purified 110-kDa protein showed that it contained, in addition to the N-deacetylase, N-sulfotransferase activity; however, the expression of N-sulfotransferase activity was independent of additional proteins. Backtracking the N-sulfotransferase through the purification scheme previously applied to the N-deacetylase showed the two enzyme activities to the N-deacetylase showed the two enzyme activities to be cofractionated in each separation step. It is proposed that the expression of glucosaminyl N-deacetylase activity depends on the concerted action of (at least) two protein components, one of which also possesses glucosaminyl N-sulfotransferase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1617938052,"Type VIII collagen is a major component of Descemet's membrane, the specialized basement membrane of corneal endothelial cells. Sequence analysis of a cDNA isolated from a library made with mRNA from rabbit corneal endothelial cells has indicated that type VIII molecules contain a polypeptide chain, alpha 1(VIII), consisting of a short triple-helical domain of 454 amino acid residues flanked by non-triple-helical domains of 117 and 173 amino acid residues at the amino and carboxyl ends, respectively (Yamaguchi, N., Benya, P. D., van der Rest, M., and Ninomiya, Y. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16022-16029). The sequence of alpha 1(VIII) is strikingly similar to that of alpha 1(X) collagen, a product of hypertrophic chondrocytes. Also, characterization of the alpha 1(VIII) and alpha 1(X) collagen genes has shown that they are quite similar in their exon organization. It has been concluded, therefore, that they are homologous members of a distinct subclass of collagen genes (Yamaguchi, N., Mayne, R., and Ninomiya, Y. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4508-4513). We have given this subclass the name short chain collagens because of the relatively small size of the triple-helical domain. In the present study, we report on the identification and characterization of a collagen gene encoding a polypeptide which is co-expressed with the alpha 1(VIII) chain in corneal endothelial cells. This collagen chain contains a triple-helical and a carboxyl non-triple-helical domain encoded by a single, large exon both in mice and humans. We conclude, therefore, that the genes encodes a novel member of the short chain collagen family, and we have given this chain the designation alpha 2(VIII) collagen. By in situ hybridization we demonstrate that the alpha 2(VIII) gene is located in the p32.3-p34.3 region of the short arm of chromosome 1."
https://openalex.org/W1555065911,"We have fractionated rat liver and identified a set of transcription factors that are essential for accurate initiation by RNA polymerase II. These factors were resolved into five distinct enzyme fractions designated alpha, beta gamma, delta, epsilon, and tau. Four of these fractions can now be replaced with purified proteins. alpha and beta gamma were previously purified to apparent homogeneity (Conaway, J. W., and Conaway, R. C. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 2357-2362). Here, we report purification to near homogeneity of transcription factor epsilon. Epsilon has a native molecular mass of approximately 90 kDa and is composed of 34- and 58-kDa polypeptides. Both the 34- and 58-kDa polypeptides are required for runoff transcription. In addition, we show that transcription factor tau is a rat liver homologue of the TATA factor (TFIID or BTF1) that can be efficiently replaced in transcription in vitro by recombinant yeast TFIID. Comparison of the two factors reveals, however, that they differ significantly in their abilities to direct the transcription system to discriminate between promoters of different sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1574497684,"The exopolysaccharide of Pseudomonas solanacearum, which is believed to play an important role in bacterial virulence, was considered by most authors as a homogeneous entity essentially composed of N-acetylgalactosamine. The present work demonstrates the high degree of heterogeneity of this exopolysaccharidic material, which consists of a high molecular weight acidic polysaccharide and a mainly noncarbohydrate structure as major subfractions. Rhamnose-rich polyoside and glucan fractions are also present as minor components. We report the complete structure of the acidic heteropolymer involving, in addition to N-acetylgalactosamine, equimolar ratios of two rare amino sugars, 2-N-acetyl-2-deoxy-L-galacturonic acid and 2-N-acetyl-4-N-(3-hydroxybutanoyl)-2,4,6-trideoxy-D-glucose. The structure of this acidic exopolysaccharide provides the first precise basis for the analysis of the correlation exopolysaccharide structure with pathogenicity in P. solanacearum."
https://openalex.org/W2040116848,"The distribution of spectrin and band 3 in deoxygenated reversibly sickled cells was visualized by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Antibodies against band 3, the major lipid-associated transmembrane protein, labeled the entire cell body, including the entire length of the long protruding spicule, whereas antibodies against spectrin labeled only the cell body and the base region of the spicules. The results suggest that the formation of long spicules during sickling is associated with a continuous polymerization of hemoglobin S polymers, presumably through gaps in the spectrin-actin meshwork, and a subsequent uncoupling of the lipid bilayer from the submembrane skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1488836512,"A method has been developed for the production, isolation, and quantitation of 15 marker peptides from the three globular domains (G1, G2, and G3) and the interglobular domain of bovine aggrecan (aggregating cartilage proteoglycan). Three of the peptides are from G1, two are from the interglobular domain, four are from G2, and six are from G3. The method involves separation of tryptic peptides by sequential anion-exchange, cation-exchange, and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and quantitation by absorbance at 220 nm. The values obtained (peak area per microgram of core protein) were a function of the molar yield and also the size and aromatic residue content of individual peptides. This procedure has been applied to aggrecan purified from fresh calf articular cartilage and to aggrecan isolated from the medium and tissue compartments of cartilage explant cultures, maintained in basal medium for 15 days without and with interleukin-1 alpha. These analyses indicate that aggrecan which is released into explant medium has a reduced content of the G1 domain, but has a normal content of the G2 domain, the COOH-terminal region of the interglobular domain, and also the G3 domain. On the other hand, aggrecan which is retained by the cartilage during 15 days of culture has a normal content of G1, interglobular domain, and G2 domains, but, in the presence of interleukin-1 alpha, it has a reduced content of the G3 domain. The percentage of medium molecules which retained the G1 domain was higher in control cultures (about 35%) than in interleukin cultures (about 20%), and this was consistent with the relative aggregability of these samples. Taken together these results suggest that catabolism of aggrecan in articular cartilage involves a specific proteolysis of the core protein at a site which is within the interglobular domain and NH2-terminal to the sequence LPGG. This process occurs in control cultures but is accelerated by the addition of interleukin-1 alpha. Degraded molecules which lack the G1 domain are released preferentially into the medium; however, these molecules carry both the G2 and G3 domains, indicating that these domains do not confer strong matrix binding properties on aggrecan. The method described here for the isolation of peptides from bovine aggrecan should have wide application to structural and biosynthetic studies on this molecule in species such as human and rat, since many of the marker peptides are from highly conserved regions of the aggrecan core protein."
https://openalex.org/W1596746039,"We have investigated the effect of staurosporine-type protein kinase inhibitors, displaying different enzyme specificity, on the association of actin with the neutrophil cytoskeleton. In resting cells, nanomolar concentrations of staurosporine induced a rapid increase in cytoskeleton-associated actin. Other inhibitors, more specific for protein kinase C (PKC) or kinases dependent on cyclic nucleotides, induced a much smaller response, indicating that inhibition of these enzymes is not involved in the staurosporine-dependent rise. Therefore, inhibition of an unknown staurosporine-sensitive enzyme, not identical with PKC or one of the cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases, can trigger an increase in cytoskeletal actin. It is well known that chemotactic peptide induces a rapid rise in cytoskeletal actin, followed by a decrease at later times after the onset of activation. Preincubation with CGP 41,251, a relatively specific inhibitor for PKC, did not affect these two events at concentrations of the drug which, in separate experiments, inhibited markedly phorbol ester induced protein phosphorylation in intact neutrophils. Thus the chemotactic peptide-induced changes in the level of cytoskeletal actin appear to be independent of PKC activation."
https://openalex.org/W1563868672,"The effect of O6-alkylation of guanine residues on the enzymic methylation of cytosine has been studied using synthetic oligonucleotides in which all guanines in cytosine-guanine sequences at potentially methylatable sites are replaced by O6-methylguanine. In contrast with the unmodified forms, which showed high acceptance activity for methyl-3H-labeled groups from S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine in the presence of DNA methylase, the modified oligonucleotides were not substrates for the enzyme either in the single-stranded or annealed forms. In view of the importance of cytosine methylation in the down-regulation of certain genes, the potential to affect gene expression by this mechanism may be a contributory factor in the toxic and carcinogenic effects of chemical methylating agents."
https://openalex.org/W1597015276,"GLUT1 glucose transporter cDNA was modified to introduce a single amino acid substitution of leucine for tryptophan 412, a putative cytochalasin B photo-affinity labeling site. Although the mutated transporter was expressed into plasma membranes of Chinese hamster ovary cells, glucose transport activity of the mutated transporter was observed to be only 15-30% of that of the wild-type GLUT1 when glucose transport activity was assessed by 2-deoxyglucose uptake at 0.1-10 mM concentrations. Analysis of glucose uptake kinetics depict that a mutation induced a 3-fold decrease in turnover number and a 2.5-fold increase in Km compared with the wild-type GLUT1. Importantly, cytochalasin B labeling was not abolished but decreased by 40%, and cytochalasin B binding was also decreased. In addition, the results obtained with side-specific glucose analogs suggested that the outer glucose binding site of the mutant appeared intact but the inner binding site was modulated. These results indicate 1) tryptophan 412 is not a cytochalasin B labeling site(s), although this residue is located in or close to the inner glucose binding site of the GLUT1 glucose transporter, 2) substitution of leucine for tryptophan 412 decreases the intrinsic activity of GLUT1 glucose transporter, which is definable as the turnover number/Km, to approximately 15% of that of the wild-type."
https://openalex.org/W1584629050,"We have analyzed the structure of the trypsin-resistant core of the protein PL-II* of the sperm from Mytilus californianus. The peptide has a molecular mass of 8436 Da and its primary sequence is ATGGAKKP STLSMIVAAIQAMKNRKGSSVQAIRKYILANNKG INTSRLGSAMKLAFAKGLKSGVLVRPKTSAGA SGATGSFRVG. This sequence bears an enormous homology and fulfills the constraints of the consensus sequence of the trypsin-resistant peptides of the proteins of the histone H1 family. Secondary structure analysis using Fourier-transform infared spectroscopy as well as predictive methods indicate the presence of 20-30% beta-structure and approximately 25% alpha-helix for this peptide. As in the case of histone H1 proteins, the protein PL-II* core exhibits a compact globular structure as deduced from hydrodynamic measurements. The presence of a histone H1 protein with protamine-like features, seems to be thus, a common general feature of the chromatin composition in the sperm of the bivalve molluscs."
https://openalex.org/W2146197315,"The expression of Ha-ras in quiescent NIH3T3 cells carrying a glucocorticoid-inducible human Ha-ras gene (Val-Gly mutation at codon 12) stimulates total 86Rb+ influx. This effect is predominantly due to an elevated 86Rb+ uptake through an ouabain-resistant, furosemide-sensitive system. The ouabain-sensitive Na+/K(+)-ATPase is less affected. The transport which is resistant to both inhibitors is not altered by Ha-ras. Overexpression of the Ha-ras proto-oncogene causes only a marginal increase in total 86Rb+ uptake. The stimulation of the furosemide-sensitive influx by Ha-ras is paralleled by an increase in mean cell volume which can be inhibited by furosemide. A rapid stimulation of the furosemide-sensitive Rb+ influx is also observed after addition of bombesin to growth-arrested cells. Furosemide inhibits the mitogenic response after expression of Ha-ras or addition of bombesin. Both the Ha-ras and the bombesin-induced stimulation of the furosemide-sensitive Rb+ transport can be blocked by protein kinase C depletion or the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine. In contrast to bombesin-induced phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis which is down-modulated by Ha-ras, the stimulation of the furosemide-sensitive Rb+ influx by bombesin is elevated in Ha-ras-expressing cells. This is in accordance with the increased mitogenic activity of bombesin in Ha-ras-expressing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1648451311,"Recent evidence suggests that insulin induces hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-glycan (PI-G) and releases inositol-glycan (IG) and diacylglycerol (DAG). These two mediators are speculated to mediate different insulin actions. In this study, we examined metabolic labeling of PI-G in BC3H-1 myocytes with known precursors of PI-G. PI-G was metabolically labeled with [3H]myo-inositol, [3H]glucosamine, [3H]galactose, [3H]glycerol, and [3H]myristic acid. The treatment of 3H-labeled PI-G with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C liberated [3H]myo-inositol, [3H]glucosamine, or [3H]galactosamine-labeled IgGs, and [3H]glycerol or [3H]myristic acid-labeled DAG. In BC3H-1 myocytes, insulin induced phosphodiesteratic hydrolysis of PI-G and stimulated generation of IGs and DAG. Released IGs were labeled with [3H]myo-inositol, [3H]glucosamine, and [3H]galactose. Released DAG was labeled with [3H] glycerol and [3H]myristic acid. The IG had a dose-dependent insulin-like activity on glucose oxidation and lipogenesis without affecting glucose transport in rat adipocytes. Insulin increased 3H radioactivities of IG and insulin-mimicking activities of IG. These results provided further evidence that hydrolysis of PI-G and generation of IGs and DAG might be early steps in some insulin actions."
https://openalex.org/W1496383698,"Lysine-2,3-aminomutase purified from Clostridium subterminale SB4 is reported to exhibit an apparent subunit Mr of 48,000, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the undenatured enzyme exhibits an apparent Mr of 285,000, as determined by electrophoretic mobility and gel permeation chromatography (Chirpich, T. P., Zappia, V., Costilow, R. N., and Barker, H. A. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 1778-1789). The diffusion coefficient of the enzyme is 3.36 x 10(-7) cm2/s, as determined by quasielastic light scattering. The overall Mr calculated from the diffusion coefficient and the published sedimentation coefficient is 259,000. Cross-linking experiments using glutaraldehyde and dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) as cross-linking reagents indicate that the enzyme has a hexameric quaternary structure. The number of major cyanogen bromide peptides, compared with the methionine content of the enzyme, is consistent with the subunits being identical, and isoelectric focusing also is consistent with identical subunits. The circular dichroism of the enzyme indicates that it is a highly ordered structure, which is estimated to consist of 26% alpha-helix and 48% beta-sheet. The enzyme contains approximately six molecules of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate per hexamer, as determined by the phenyl-hydrazine method. The amino acid analysis of the enzyme, after performic acid oxidation, indicates that it contains approximately 13 cysteine residues per subunit. Six sulfhydryl groups per hexamer react readily with 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoate, indicating that one sulfhydryl group is accessible per subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1564674741,"We describe a unique 110-kDa protein, xlcaax-1, that is a member of a group of membrane-associated proteins such as the ras and ras-related proteins and nuclear lamins. Many of these proteins are involved in signal transduction or cell signaling, possess a C-terminal CAAX box, and undergo fatty acid acylation (Glomset, J. A., Gelb, M. H., and Farnsworth, C. C. (1990) Trends Biochem. Sci. 15, 139-142). The ras and ras-related proteins bind GTP and in most cases are both isoprenylated and palmitoylated. The xlcaax-1 protein possesses a C-terminal CAAX sequence that is identical to the N-ras protein. In addition to the CAAX box, xlcaax-1 contains a series of basic amino acids upstream of the CAAX sequence similar to several nonpalmitoylated forms of the ras-related proteins. When the xlcaax-1 cDNA is expressed in a baculovirus expression system, the product undergoes isoprenylation and palmitoylation utilizing a mechanism similar to that of the ras proteins. In addition, the xlcaax-1 protein is isoprenylated, and a minor fraction is palmitoylated in Xenopus XTC tissue culture cells. We have also demonstrated that the protein is associated with membrane fractions in full-grown Xenopus oocytes and in Xenopus XTC tissue culture cells and that membrane association is isoprenylation-dependent. The presence of maternal molecules possessing signal transduction potential is an attractive mechanism for modulating the effects of growth factors and other signal molecules during development."
https://openalex.org/W1952510352,"Morphine administered as a subcutaneous implant inhibits the initial increase in cytoplasmic free-calcium [Ca2+]i induced by mitogens in mouse splenocytes. This effect was not reproduced by incubation of splenocytes with morphine (10(-8)-10(-4) M). Analysis of splenocyte subpopulations demonstrates that this effect was manifest in both B and T cells. However, within T cell subpopulations, CD4+ but not CD8+ cells were affected. Adrenalectomy abolished this effect of morphine in CD4+ T but not CD4-, CD8- spleen cells (most likely Thy 1.2- B cells). Moreover, simultaneous administration of the opiate antagonist naltrexone blocked the effect of morphine in CD4-, CD8- spleen cells, but not in CD4+ T cells. These data indicate that the effects of morphine on mitogen-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i may be mediated through distinct glucocorticoid-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The morphine-induced inhibition of an increase in [Ca2+]i in immune cells reported here may be an early event mediating opiate-induced immunosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W1516271347,"The rules of the genetic code are determined by the specific aminoacylation of transfer RNAs by aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetase. A straightforward analysis shows that a system of synthetase-tRNA interactions that relies on anticodons for specificity could, in principle, enable most synthetases to distinguish their cognate tRNA isoacceptors from all others. Although the anticodons of some tRNAs are recognition sites for the cognate aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, for other synthetases the anticodon is dispensable for specific aminoacylation. In particular, alanine and histidine tRNA synthetases aminoacylate small RNA minihelices that reconstruct the part of their cognate tRNAs that is proximate to the amino acid attachment site. Helices with as few as six base pairs can be efficiently aminoacylated. The specificity of aminoacylation is determined by a few nucleotides and can be converted from one amino acid to another by the change of only a few nucleotides. These findings suggest that, for a subgroup of the synthetases, there is a distinct code in the acceptor helix of transfer RNAs that determines aminoacylation specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1569102428,"Gene 32 protein (gp32), a single-stranded DNA-binding protein from bacteriophage T4, contains a zinc-binding subdomain with sequence homologies to the 3-cysteine/1-histidine zinc-binding motif found in a variety of retroviruses and plant viruses. In vitro studies suggest that autoregulation of gp32 occurs at the level of translation by gp32 specifically binding gene 32 mRNA at an unusual stem-loop structure that can be modeled as an RNA pseudoknot. Nucleation of gp32 binding via this pseudoknot is thought to be needed to facilitate cooperative binding of gp32 through a largely unstructured region that overlaps the ribosome binding site (McPheeters, D. S., Stormo, G. D., and Gold, L. (1988) J. Mol. Biol. 201, 517-535). Removal of Zn(II) from gp32 results in a protein that retains the ability to bind single-stranded RNA with high affinity but is unable to specifically autoregulate itself at the level of translation. Deletion of the pseudoknot sequences from the gene 32 autoregulatory region results in an mRNA that cannot be repressed by gp32. These results suggest that the zinc-binding subdomain of gp32 plays an essential role in autoregulation by providing a critical element necessary for nucleating cooperative binding at the gene 32 mRNA pseudoknot."
https://openalex.org/W1482247598,"Two proteins have been identified which stimulate a mutant form of dnaA protein in replication of plasmids containing the chromosomal origin, oriC. One of these is dnaK protein by the criteria of (i) absence of stimulatory activity in enzyme fractions from dnaK mutants, (ii) elevated levels of stimulatory activity in fractions from a dnaK protein overproducer, (iii) comigration of the stimulatory protein with authentic dnaK protein by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and (iv) replacement of this stimulatory protein by dnaK protein in stimulation assays. The stimulatory effect of dnaK protein on dnaA46 protein in replication suggests that this interaction, occurring prior to its action in DNA replication, may regulate its activity."
https://openalex.org/W1505372025,"Abstract In Escherichia coli, the expression of the phenylalanine biosynthetic enzyme chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydratase, encoded by pheA, is elevated in strains carrying pheR mutants. By constructing a series of pheA''cat'lacZ fusions with different endpoints for deletions of the pheA regulatory DNA, the site of action of the pheR product on pheA expression was determined to be the pheA attenuator. Southern blot analysis of chromosomal DNA from a pheR374 strain showed it to carry a deletion of pheR and the flanking DNA on each side. This deletion resulted in a decrease of approximately 30% in the intracellular concentration of tRNA(Phe), the pheR product. The expression of the pheST operon, which encodes the two subunits of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase and which is also regulated by attenuation control involving phenylalanyl-tRNA(Phe), was increased 5-fold by the pheR374 allele. No effect of pheR on pheST expression was seen in a pheST(att-) strain. It was concluded that the elevated expression of pheA and pheST in pheR mutants is a consequence of a lower frequency of transcription termination in the attenuator caused by lower levels of phenylalanyl-tRNA(Phe)."
https://openalex.org/W1519498080,"The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) plays a key role in the process of antigen recognition. It is a complex of at least seven peptide chains (alpha beta gamma delta epsilon zeta-zeta). It is found on the surface of mature T cells and functions in antigen binding in the presence of the major histocompatibility complex. It has been known for some time that physical associations between the CD3 proteins and the TCR chains are essential for efficient transport of either component to the surface of T cells. For example, T cells that lack either the alpha, beta, or delta chains synthesize partial complexes that are eventually degraded. cDNAs encoding the six chains of receptor have become available recently. We have used transfection techniques to generate a panel of Chinese hamster ovary cells that contain partial receptor complexes of known composition and also cells that express all six subunits of the TCR.CD3 complex. Cells in this panel were analyzed for the ability to form alpha-beta heterodimers and also an ability to transport the synthesized chains to the plasma membrane. These studies have allowed us to define the minimum requirements for TCR.CD3 expression on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1511902344,"To assess the impact of various heavy and light chain mutations on p-azophenylarsonate binding, murine antibodies have been produced in insect cells (SF9) utilizing a baculovirus expression system. When expressed in this system, an antibody composed of a canonical CRIA+ heavy and light chain can bind antigen and express idiotype indistinguishably from analogous hybridoma-derived antibodies. Antibodies comprised of either light chains mutant at the V-J junction or heavy chains mutant at the V-D junction were found to be incapable of binding arsonate. In addition, substitutions in the first and second complementarity determining regions of the heavy chain were shown to play a role in arsonate binding, most likely related to affinity maturation targeted at the carrier protein. These results confirm the obligatory role that junctional diversity plays in the generation of arsonate-specific antibodies, as well as extend our understanding of the role of other variable region amino acids in arsonate binding."
https://openalex.org/W1557473538,"Progestins induce fatty acid synthetase (FAS) in breast cancer cell lines, both increasing its gene transcription and mRNA stabilization (Joyeux, C., Rochefort, H., and Chalbos, D. (1989) Mol. Endocrinol. 4, 681-686). In vitro run-on transcription assays show that RU486, in contrast to progestin, inhibits FAS transcription by 40-50%. Moreover and surprisingly, anti-progestin RU486 also stabilizes FAS mRNA 3- to 4-fold in MCF7 cells as measured by chase experiments in the presence of actinomycin D or cordycepin or after short cell labeling with [3H]uridine. Dexamethasone is inefficient in increasing the half-life of FAS mRNA in MCF7 cells. RU486 had no effect on MDA-MB 231 cells which contain glucocorticoid but no progesterone receptors, indicating that the progesterone receptor is implicated in this regulation. RU486-induced mRNA stabilization allows delayed accumulation of FAS mRNA. These results indicate that the progesterone receptor can be activated separately to stimulate gene transcription or stabilize mRNA."

To investigate the effect of the amino acid occupying position 342 on secretion of A1Pi, we have used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of A1Pi cDNA to randomly change the codon specifying this amino acid. Since replacement of Glu342 by Lys leads to a change in the predicted secondary structure for this protein, we also tested the possibility that defective secretion of A1PiZ is the result of this type of alteration. For this purpose, site-directed mutagenesis was used to produce sequences encoding A1Pi retaining Glu342 but predicted to have A1PiZ type secondary structure. The effects of 10 different amino acids occupying position 342 on the secretion of A1Pi were determined by pulse-chase experiments and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of medium from transiently transfected COS cells. Results of these studies show that secretion of A1Pi is most efficient when position 342 is occupied by a negatively charged amino acid, efficient but somewhat less so when occupied by a neutral amino acid, and least efficient when a positively charged residue is present. The mutation designed to alter secondary structure had no effect on the secretion of A1Pi. As indicated by immunofluorescence microscopy and mobility of intracellular A1Pi on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, lowered secretion is accompanied by accumulation of A1Pi in the endoplasmic reticulum of the transfected cells. These results are compatible with the ideas that secretion of A1Pi is directly influenced by the amino acid occupying position 342, that a positively charged amino acid in this position is especially detrimental to secretion of this protein, and that the rate-limiting step in the secretion of the altered forms is transport from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi."
https://openalex.org/W1560019544,"The folding pathway of pancreatic serine proteases was clarified from kinetic studies on the refolding of the glutathione-mixed disulfide derivative of bovine neochymotrypsinogen. Neochymotrypsinogen is prepared from a limited proteolysis of native chymotrypsinogen A by cleavage at Tyr146-Thr147 (Duda and Light (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9866-9871). The mixed disulfide methodology (Odorzynski and Light (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4291-4295) was necessary to successfully refold chymotrypsinogen and neochymotrypsinogen. Mixtures of the chromatographically purified amino- and carboxyl-terminal polypeptides of neochymotrypsinogen, as the mixed disulfide derivatives, were refolded at varying molar ratios of the polypeptides. The regeneration of native structure was followed as a function of time from activity measurements and from the regain of the molecular weight of the zymogen. The rate data fit first-order kinetics. The kinetic analysis is compatible with a folding mechanism that supports (a) independent folding of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains; (b) identical rates of folding of each domain; and (c) the rate-limiting step is the formation of the interdomain disulfide. The formation of a stable complex of the folded domains was favored by complementary hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions and the formation of the last disulfide bond. The geometric arrangement of the active site residues was regained and the zymogen could be converted to the active enzyme, namely, alpha-chymotrypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1555484746,"Phenol hydroxylase, an FAD-containing monooxygenase, catalyzes the conversion of substituted phenols to the corresponding catechol. Use of metapyrocatechase, capable of dioxygenation of several catechols to give highly absorbing products, permitted determination of the time course of product release from phenol hydroxylase. Product dissociated prior to complete reoxidation of the enzyme, most likely concomitant with formation of the 4a-hydroxyflavin species (intermediate III). Deuterated phenol and thiophenol exhibited no kinetic isotope effect during the oxidative half-reaction. Isotope effects of 1.7 to 3.7 were found with resorcinol for the conversion of the second intermediate to intermediate III. These effects limited the possible models for phenol hydroxylation. An attempt was made to distinguish whether the spectrum of intermediate II is due entirely to that of the flavin moiety of phenol hydroxylase or whether some radical intermediate form involved in the formation of catechol makes a significant visible contribution. Reduced native and 6-hydroxy-FAD phenol hydroxylase were reacted with oxygen and resorcinol in order to provide evidence for the identity of intermediate II."
https://openalex.org/W1503289795,"Recently, the synthesis and properties of several 6-substituted flavins as active site probes for flavoproteins have been reported (Ghisla, S., Massey, V., and Yagi, K. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 3282-3289). Here, we report results of experiments in which 6-thiocyanato-FAD and 6-mercapto-FAD have been substituted for the native flavin of phenol hydroxylase. The 6-SCN-FAD enzyme was converted spontaneously to the 6-mercaptoflavin form probably due to dissociation of flavin, followed by attack of external protein thiols. The pK alpha values of uncomplexed and phenol-bound 6-mercapto-FAD enzyme were determined. Both the spontaneously formed 6-mercapto-FAD enzyme and the enzyme reconstituted with preformed 6-mercapto-FAD were treated with a variety of thiol-specific reagents, and reaction rates were followed by spectroscopic means. Comparison with the corresponding rates found with free flavin suggested a high degree of accessibility to the flavin 6-position. Accessibility was somewhat decreased in the presence of phenol. Upon treatment with low concentrations of methyl methanethiosulfonate or N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), extremely rapid spectral changes were apparent. The former reaction, however, was reversed spontaneously within 2 h. Reaction with NEM was biphasic, with spectral changes consistent with the mechanism previously proposed (Steenkamp, D. J., McIntire, W., and Kenney, W. C. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 2818-2824), followed by a small absorbance decrease due to protein conformational changes. The NEM reaction is unusual, being easily reversed by addition of excess dithiothreitol."
