https://openalex.org/W2888618670,"Protein–protein interactions in cells are rapidly identified with improved proximity labeling methods. Protein interaction networks and protein compartmentalization underlie all signaling and regulatory processes in cells. Enzyme-catalyzed proximity labeling (PL) has emerged as a new approach to study the spatial and interaction characteristics of proteins in living cells. However, current PL methods require over 18 h of labeling time or utilize chemicals with limited cell permeability or high toxicity. We used yeast display-based directed evolution to engineer two promiscuous mutants of biotin ligase, TurboID and miniTurbo, which catalyze PL with much greater efficiency than BioID or BioID2, and enable 10-min PL in cells with non-toxic and easily deliverable biotin. Furthermore, TurboID extends biotin-based PL to flies and worms."
https://openalex.org/W2885351238,"The neurovascular unit (NVU) regulates metabolic homeostasis as well as drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the central nervous system. Metabolic fluxes and conversions over the NVU rely on interactions between brain microvascular endothelium, perivascular pericytes, astrocytes and neurons, making it difficult to identify the contributions of each cell type. Here we model the human NVU using microfluidic organ chips, allowing analysis of the roles of individual cell types in NVU functions. Three coupled chips model influx across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the brain parenchymal compartment and efflux across the BBB. We used this linked system to mimic the effect of intravascular administration of the psychoactive drug methamphetamine and to identify previously unknown metabolic coupling between the BBB and neurons. Thus, the NVU system offers an in vitro approach for probing transport, efficacy, mechanism of action and toxicity of neuroactive drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2888575486,"Background Sarcopenia, defined as decreased skeletal muscle mass, is prevalent and associated with poor prognosis in various solid tumors. This study aimed to determine the prognostic role of sarcopenia in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Methods This retrospective study consisted of 140 consecutive patients who underwent palliative chemotherapy for AGC. A cross-sectional area of muscle at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) was measured using baseline computed tomography (CT) scans. Sarcopenia was defined as a L3 skeletal muscle index of ≤ 49 cm2/m2 for men and ≤ 31 cm2/m2 for women using Korean-specific cutoffs. We compared the overall survival (OS) and clinical characteristics of patients with and without sarcopenia. Results The median age was 67 years, and 133 (95%) patients had metastatic disease. Sarcopenia was present in 67 patients (47.9%) and was significantly related to male sex (p < 0.001) and low body mass index (p = 0.002). Patients with sarcopenia had a significantly shorter OS than those without sarcopenia (median, 6.8 months vs. 10.3 months, respectively; p = 0.033). In the multivariable analysis, sarcopenia was an independent prognostic factor of poor OS (hazard ratio, 1.51, p = 0.029); no response to chemotherapy (p < 0.001), no second-line chemotherapy (p < 0.001), metastatic sites ≥ 3 (p < 0.001), and low serum albumin level (p = 0.033) were also independent prognostic factors of poor OS. Conclusion Sarcopenia, as determined by baseline CT, can be used to predict poor prognosis in AGC patients treated with palliative chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2888377634,"Feature selection and classification are the main topics in microarray data analysis. Although many feature selection methods have been proposed and developed in this field, SVM-RFE (Support Vector Machine based on Recursive Feature Elimination) is proved as one of the best feature selection methods, which ranks the features (genes) by training support vector machine classification model and selects key genes combining with recursive feature elimination strategy. The principal drawback of SVM-RFE is the huge time consumption. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a more efficient implementation of linear support vector machines and improve the recursive feature elimination strategy and then combine them together to select informative genes. Besides, we propose a simple resampling method to preprocess the datasets, which makes the information distribution of different kinds of samples balanced and the classification results more credible. Moreover, the applicability of four common classifiers is also studied in this paper. Extensive experiments are conducted on six most frequently used microarray datasets in this field, and the results show that the proposed methods have not only reduced the time consumption greatly but also obtained comparable classification performance."
https://openalex.org/W2888071550,"Background The definition criteria and clinical characteristics of implant-associated infection (IAI) caused by Cutibacterium (formerly Propionibacterium) spp. are poorly known. We analyzed microbiologically proven Cutibacterium orthopedic IAI in a prospective cohort. Methods Patients with periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) and fixation device–associated infections (FDAI) caused by Cutibacterium spp. were prospectively included. IAI was defined by significant growth of Cutibacterium spp. and presence of at least one non-microbiological criterion for infection. The McNemar’s chi-squared or binomial test was used to compare the performance of diagnostic tests. Results Of 121 patients with Cutibacterium IAI, 62 patients (51%) had PJI and 59 (49%) had FDAI. 109 infections (90%) were caused by C. acnes and 12 (10%) by C. avidum. The median time from implantation until diagnosis of infection was 15.7 months (interquartile range, 5–46.5 months). Clinical local signs were present in 30 patients (28%) and radiological implant loosening in 64 patients (63%). Culture sensitivity of sonication fluid was 84%, of peri-implant tissue 84% and of synovial or peri-implant fluid 56% after 14 days of incubation. Conclusion Cutibacterium IAI was diagnosed late in the disease course and presented with subtle signs. Prolonged culture incubation and implant sonication improved the poor performance of conventional microbiological tests. Due to lack of reliable diagnostic tests, Cutibacterium remains difficult to detect making the diagnosis challenging."
https://openalex.org/W2888449126,"Thermophilic fungi are a promising source of thermostable enzymes able to hydrolytically or oxidatively degrade plant cell wall components. Among these enzymes are lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), enzymes capable of enhancing biomass hydrolysis through an oxidative mechanism. Myceliophthora thermophila (synonym Sporotrichum thermophile), an Ascomycete fungus, expresses and secretes over a dozen different LPMOs. In this study, we report the overexpression and biochemical study of a previously uncharacterized LPMO (MtLPMO9J) from M. thermophila M77 in Aspergillus nidulans. MtLPMO9J is a single-domain LPMO and has 63% sequence similarity with the catalytic domain of NcLPMO9C from Neurospora crassa. Biochemical characterization of MtLPMO9J revealed that it performs C4-oxidation and is active against cellulose, soluble cello-oligosaccharides and xyloglucan. Moreover, biophysical studies showed that MtLPMO9J is structurally stable at pH above 5 and at temperatures up to 50°C. Importantly, LC-MS analysis of the peptides after tryptic digestion of the recombinantly produced protein revealed not only the correct processing of the signal peptide and methylation of the N-terminal histidine, but also partial autoxidation of the catalytic center. This shows that redox conditions need to be controlled, not only during LPMO reactions but also during protein production, to protect LPMOs from oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W2888539992,"Recent findings show that cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles may undergo in vivo-induced size transformation with the formation of smaller particles that could result in a higher translocation following pulmonary exposure compared to virtually insoluble particles, like titanium dioxide (TiO2). Therefore, we compared liver deposition of CeO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles of similar primary sizes 1, 28 or 180 days after intratracheal instillation of 162 μg of NPs in female C57BL/6 mice. Mice exposed to 162 μg CeO2 or TiO2 nanoparticles by intravenous injection or oral gavage were included as reference groups to assess the amount of NPs that reach the liver bypassing the lungs and the translocation of NPs from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver, respectively. Pulmonary deposited CeO2 nanoparticles were detected in the liver 28 and 180 days post-exposure and TiO2 nanoparticles 180 days post-exposure as determined by darkfield imaging and by the quantification of Ce and Ti mass concentration by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Ce and Ti concentrations increased over time and 180 days post-exposure the translocation to the liver was 2.87 ± 3.37% and 1.24 ± 1.98% of the initial pulmonary dose, respectively. Single particle ICP-MS showed that the size of CeO2 nanoparticles in both lung and liver tissue decreased over time. No nanoparticles were detected in the liver following oral gavage. Our results suggest that pulmonary deposited CeO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles translocate to the liver with similar calculated translocation rates despite their different chemical composition and shape. The observed particle size distributions of CeO2 nanoparticles indicate in vivo processing over time both in lung and liver. The fact that no particles were detected in the liver following oral exposure showed that direct translocation of nanoparticles from lung to the systemic circulation was the most important route of translocation for pulmonary deposited particles."
https://openalex.org/W2888043569,"Plants exhibit a diverse set of functional traits and ecological strategies which reflect an adaptation process to the biotic and abiotic components of the environment. The Plant Economic Spectrum organizes these traits along a continuum from conservative to acquisitive resource use strategies and shows how the abiotic environment governs a species’ position along the continuum. However, this framework does not typically account for leaf traits associated with herbivore resistance, despite fundamental metabolic links (and therefore co-variance) between resource use traits and defensive traits. Here we analyzed a suite of leaf traits associated with either resource use (specific leaf area [SLA], nutrients and water content) or defenses (phenolic compounds) for saplings of 11 species of oaks (Quercus spp.), and further investigated whether climatic variables underlie patterns of trait interspecific variation. An ordination of leaf traits revealed the primary axis of trait variation to be leaf economic spectrum traits associated with resource use (SLA, nitrogen, water content) in conjunction with a defensive trait (condensed tannins). Secondary and tertiary axes of trait variation were mainly associated with other defensive traits (lignins, flavonoids, and hydrolysable tannins). Within the primary axis we found a trade-off between resource use traits and both water content and condensed tannins; species with high SLA and leaf N values invested less in condensed tannins and viceversa. Moreover, temperature and precipitation mediated the trait space occupied by species, such that species distributed in warmer and drier climates had less leaf N, lower SLA, and more defenses (condensed tannins, lignins and flavonoids), whereas opposite values were observed for species distributed in colder and wetter climates. These results emphasize the role of abiotic controls over all-inclusive axes of trait variation and contribute to a more complete understanding of interspecific variation in plant functional strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2888238032,"This study promotes a novel teaching approach for integration of children’s traditional games in elementary school program. It gives description of six traditional games and their educational prospects, implemented in six learning sessions in five elementary schools in Macedonia, involving 102 students. The comparison of learning achievements between these learning sessions and standard classes revealed increased students’ learning performance on comparable topics. To understand the reason for improvement, we have surveyed students after each session and tested the gathered data set via the development of a structural equation model that examines the relationships between student’s personality traits, motivation and experience with learning outcomes. The findings show that students’ achievements were directly influenced by students’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors, as well as perceived experience. Additionally, the integration of traditional games in the elementary school classroom was equally accepted among all students, since their personality traits did not directly influence their experience or learning outcomes. Still, the link between the students’ personality dimensions and motivation revealed that introvert children might have slightly increased motivation and possibility to open up during game-play in such collaborative environments."
https://openalex.org/W2888453839,"The RNA-binding protein Musashi 2 (MSI2) has emerged as an important regulator in cancer initiation, progression, and drug resistance.

Cell division is orchestrated by signal transduction pathways composed of multiple proteins including transcription factors, receptor G proteins, and protein kinases. Genetic alterations such as chromosomal translocations in these proteins turn them into oncogenes, leading to loss of function and uncontrolled cell growth. Recurrent (balanced) chromosomal translocations in oncogenes like MLL, ETV6, BCL2, and c-Myc lead to multiple hematological malignancies (1Aplan P.D.

MSI2 forms a fusion product with HOXA9, thus forming a cryptic in-frame MSI2-HOXA9 with translocation t(7;17) fusion transcript (Fig. 1A). The breakpoint on HOXA9 occurs in exon 1b and in MSI2 after exon 9, which results in a fusion transcript that retains both the RNA-recognition elements (RRE) of MSI2 and the homeobox domain of HOXA9. HOXA9 belongs to family of homeobox-containing transcription factors that have roles in morphogenesis, proliferation, and hematopoietic stem cell expansion (3Collins C.T. Hess J.L.

We here report targets regulated by MSI2 post-transcriptionally, which play roles in functions including DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell death and survival. Pathways regulated by MSI2 included EGF, HGF signaling, and eIF2 signaling pathways. The EGF and HGF pathways in turn regulate PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, and ERK/MAPK pathways. We investigated one of the most highly regulated targets from our pathway analysis, IL6ST, a transmembrane signal transducer belonging to the IL-6 signaling cascade entity. IL-6 signaling includes multiple cytokines like IL-6, IL-11, LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor), OSM (oncostatin M) which together are called IL-6 type cytokines. These cytokines activate the receptor IL6ST which in turn phosphorylates downstream targets, thereby activating JAK/STAT, ERK, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways (17Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S.

The list of targets and the pathways they regulate increase our understanding of the role of MSI2 in leukemia, and thus may pave the way for the development of targeted therapies. We performed PAR-CLIP to identify the transcriptome-wide targets of MSI2 in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293, Flp-In TREx) (Fig. 1B). The analysis of the MSI2 PAR-CLIP datasets revealed a total of 20,531 RBP-bound genomic regions after filtering for confident clusters (CCs). CCs contained two or more T-C conversion sites (cross-linked sites) and ≥10 overlapping reads (for cluster lengths and cluster site distances between CCs, see Fig. S1, B and C). Using gene annotation information for GRCh38 we identified 7378 distinct genes targeted by MSI2. We then examined the distribution of CCs across intronic and exonic regions of mRNA primary transcripts. MSI2 bound to intronic regions (39%) and 3′UTR regions (40%) equally, whereas only 7% bound to exonic regions (Fig. 1C). Next, we used the data from PAR-CLIP to identify the actual RNA sequence motif that was bound by the RBPs. Many RBPs bind RNA in a sequence-specific manner, with the recognized binding region usually referred to as the RNA-recognition element. This motif prediction was performed using MEME (multiple EM for motif elicitation). To elucidate the RRE of MSI2, we restricted our analysis to CCs with a T-C mutation frequency of ≥20% and two or more T-C positional changes. The genomic reference sequences of the 100 most abundantly sequenced clusters located in introns, exons, or 3′UTRs were used. MSI2 datasets revealed the motif as TTAG (E-value (MSI2) = 9.3E-44) (Fig. 1D). We performed EMSAs to test a selection of synthetic RNAs representing the MSI2-binding sites using recombinant MSI2 protein. We tested a tetranucleotide repeat of the motif (UUAG) (length of 24 nucleotides) as well as a control with GC repeated 12 times to match the length of the motif probe. We observed a shift in the protein-RNA complex containing the predicted MSI2 motif, whereas a shift is completely absent using the control probe, indicating no binding between the RBP and the control probe (Fig. 1E). The exact motif was present in 76% of the top 100 MSI2 CCs, whereas the remaining clusters contained slight variations of the given motif. Next, we investigated which transcripts were preferentially bound and directly regulated by MSI2. Therefore, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of MSI2 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2A) and investigated the gene expression profiles with high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) (Fig. 2B). We identified differentially expressed genes with stringent thresholds having a logFC (logarithm of fold change) >1.5 or <−1.5 and false discovery rate (FDR) ≤0.05 (Fig. 2C). Next, we integrated the PAR-CLIP data for MSI2 to identify physically bound and differentially regulated genes, which we term as the direct targets of MSI2. In total, we found 230 genes to be directly under regulation of MSI2 (Fig. 2D; Table S1). Among those, 82% of the genes showed a down-regulation versus 18% to be up-regulated upon MSI2 knockdown. Previous RIP-CHIP analysis for MSI2 also revealed a similar pattern of more down-regulated genes versus up-regulated ones upon MSI2 knockdown (13Park S.M. Deering R.P. Lu Y. Tivnan P. Lianoglou S.

Using our results from direct MSI2 targets, we evaluated the biological processes that are regulated by MSI2 by applying Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The entire output of differentially regulated genes for MSI2 KD (FDR ≤0.05 and logFC ≥ ± 1) as well as only the genes, which were differentially expressed and showed at least one confident PAR-CLIP cluster (FDR ≤0.05, logFC ≥ ± 1.5, T-C conversion ≥0.25), were selected to be analyzed by IPA. The entirety of differentially regulated genes revealed six canonical pathways to be significantly affected (FDR ≤0.05) by MSI2 (Table S2). These included but were not limited to growth factor pathways such as HGF and EGF signaling, which were activated upon MSI2 KD (z-scores of 2.4 and 1.7, respectively). The eIF2 signaling pathway was the most significantly affected pathway upon MSI2 KD and showed a total overlap of 43.6% genes of the pathway with the differentially expressed genes of MSI2 KD. It was predicted to be highly inhibited upon MSI2 knockdown with z-score of −5.217 for MSI2. The other pathways, including eIF4 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4) and p70S6 kinase pathway, actin cytoskeleton pathway and EGF, HGF growth factor pathways were all highly activated upon MSI2KD with positive z-scores. To investigate the downstream effects of MSI2 further, we searched for upstream targets in the direct targets list of MSI2 that are associated with these signaling pathways, and found IL6ST to be bound and transcriptionally regulated by MSI2 in a negative fashion as proposed by our genome-wide pathway analysis. We eventually focused our attention onto interleukin 6 signal transducer, or IL6ST, which was also one of the most highly regulated targets. IL6ST expression was significantly increased (logFC = 1.98; FDR = 6.4E-17) upon MSI2 knockdown and thus negatively correlated with MSI2 expression (Fig. 3A). To confirm the result, we performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) on MSI2 knockdown cells and observed increased expression of IL6ST (Fig. 3B). In addition, IL6ST contained an MSI2-binding site in its 3′UTR, which we validated by EMSA (Fig. S1D). We also created stable knockdown of MSI2 in HEK293T cells using shRNA construct and observed an increase in the levels of IL6ST protein levels (Fig. 3C). To further confirm that MSI2 is a negative regulator of IL6ST, a control vector and a vector expressing MSI2 stably were transfected into HEK293T cells. The stable expression of MSI2 significantly decreased IL6ST mRNA levels (Fig. 3D). Similarly, we tested this regulatory link in cells with MSI2 expression under the control of an inducible tetracycline promoter. As controls, we used cells in which RBMS2 and EWSR1 expression were under the control of tetracycline promoter. Upon induction of these three cell lines with doxycycline, levels of IL6ST decreased in MSI2 cells, whereas no effect was observed in cells expressing RBMS2 and EWSR1 (Fig. 3E). To avoid cell-specific impact of MSI2 on IL6ST expression, we chose to examine Lenti GFP+ Hep G2 cells, which also have high native IL6ST surface expression. We knocked down MSI2 in these cells and checked for surface expression of IL6ST using FACS and observed an increased surface expression of IL6ST (Fig. 3F). We also analyzed RNA-Seq data of 72 AML patient datasets and found that this reciprocal relationship between IL6ST and MSI2 holds true in AML context as well (see supporting information). Together, these data suggest that overexpression of MSI2 decreases IL6ST transcript and protein levels and vice versa. These effects on mRNA abundance of IL6ST by differential expression of MSI2 suggest that MSI2 likely regulates the stability of the IL6ST transcript. To gain understanding of how MSI2 binding to the IL6ST 3′UTR affects IL6ST mRNA translation, we cloned the 3′UTR region of IL6ST that contains multiple MSI2 binding motifs into a luciferase reporter construct (psiCHECK2) bearing the Renilla luciferase coding region along with firefly luciferase, which served as an internal control for transfection (Fig. S2A). psiCHECK2-IL6ST (3′UTR) and the parent vector psiCHECK2 were transfected into HEK293Ts that expressed either normal or reduced levels of MSI2. As shown in Fig. 3G, MSI2 silencing clearly increased the luciferase expression of psiCHECK2-IL6ST, whereas parent vector levels did not change, indicating that the binding of MSI2 to IL6ST 3′UTR was responsible for promoting the degradation of the IL6ST. To further test if the binding of MSI2 to IL6ST mRNA affects its stability, we performed mRNA stability assays by treating the cells with actinomycin D to inhibit de novo RNA synthesis. We found that the mRNA levels of IL6ST were higher in cells treated with MSI2 siRNA when compared with those in control cells (Fig. 3H). Together, these findings indicate that binding of MSI2 to the 3′UTR of IL6ST mRNA enhances the degradation of the IL6ST by destabilizing it. Having established the regulatory role of MSI2 on IL6ST stability and expression, we aimed to understand the molecular mechanisms modulated by this regulation. We therefore evaluated the pathways, STAT3 phosphorylation, and ERK phosphorylation, which are induced by signal transduction through IL6ST as well as affected by EGF and HGF signaling. We checked for the phosphorylation status of STAT3 and ERK upon IL6ST overexpression in the stable MSI2 knockdown cells. For this, we stimulated the stable knockdown cells with different concentrations of IL-6 cytokine (0–900 ng/μl). IL-6 activates IL6ST which in turn leads to initiation of JAK/STAT signaling. The protein levels of IL6ST, total STAT3, and phosphorylated STAT3 were examined after IL-6 stimulation. We noticed a constant hyperphosphorylation of STAT3 upon increased IL-6 concentration whereas total protein content remained unchanged (Fig. 4A). Similarly, we also checked the protein levels of IL6ST, total ERK, and phosphorylated ERK after IL-6 stimulation and noticed similar hyperphosphorylation in ERK (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that post-transcriptional gene regulation of IL6ST by MSI2 affects the phosphorylation of STAT3 and ERK proteins, which in turn affects JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling pathways. In this study we investigated the RNA-binding partners of the RNA-binding protein MSI2 and confirmed the RRE by both PAR-CLIP and EMSA. Furthermore, we identified that IL6ST, a signal transducer for multiple cytokines, is bound and regulated by MSI2. We also showed that stimulating MSI2 knockdown cells with IL-6 led to hyperphosphorylation of STAT3 and ERK1/2. Thus, we identified targets bound and regulated by MSI2 and put forth a novel mechanism by which IL6ST is post-transcriptionally regulated by an RNA-binding protein. Because IL6ST is part of IL-6 signaling mechanism, we described a novel pathway, by which this signaling mechanism can be regulated. Although MSI2 has been implicated in the development of several aggressive cancers as well as exerting important cellular functions, the RNA-binding partners of this RNA-binding protein have not been thoroughly investigated. Applying PAR-CLIP and RNA-Seq to MSI2, we found several relevant RNA-binding partners and their respective RNA-binding motif. The high degree of conservation among MSI family members across broad ranges of animal phyla indicates that their motifs might be similar. Okano and co-workers identified a similar motif in Drosophila MSI and mouse MSI1 as (G/A)U1–3AGU (19Imai T. Tokunaga A. Yoshida T. Hashimoto M. Mikoshiba K. Weinmaster G. Nakafuku M. Okano H. The neural RNA-binding protein Musashi1 translationally regulates mammalian numb gene expression by interacting with its mRNA.Mol. Cell.

Also, the motif in mouse MSI1 was found to be 87% identical to human MSI2 (20Zearfoss N.R. Deveau L.M. Clingman C.C. Schmidt E. Johnson E.S. Massi F. Ryder S.P. A conserved three-nucleotide core motif defines Musashi RNA binding specificity.J. Biol.

Although the motifs are identical, there is a differential binding specificity among Drosophila, mouse, and human MSI RRM family domains, suggesting a functional divergence. Despite this divergence, the core element driving the binding among MSI family has been evolutionarily conserved and was established by Zearfoss et al. as UAG using quantitative fluorescence anisotropy assay (20Zearfoss N.R. Deveau L.M. Clingman C.C. Schmidt E. Johnson E.S. Massi F. Ryder S.P. A conserved three-nucleotide core motif defines Musashi RNA binding specificity.J. Biol.

Consistent with this study, our data also revealed a similar motif in human MSI2 to be U followed by UAG (UUAG) which was present in 76% of the top 100 binding sites in our PAR-CLIP datasets. We have identified several novel targets of MSI2 which were previously shown to play an important role in hematopoiesis. Among them is KMT2A (alias ALL1, MLL), which is a transcriptional co-activator that plays an important role in hematopoiesis and is also known to be frequently translocated in many leukemias (21Rao R.C. Dou Y. Hijacked in cancer: the KMT2 (MLL) family of methyltransferases.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15 (25998713): 334-34610.1038/nrc3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Another target, EGR1, was shown to be often deregulated in hematological malignancies such as AML, CML, multiple myelomas and B cell lymphomas (22Tian J. Li Z. Han Y. Jiang T. Song X. Jiang G. The progress of early growth response factor 1 and leukemia.Intractable Rare Dis. Res. 2016; 5 (27195189): 76-8210.5582/irdr.2015.01049Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). ASXL2, another target of MSI2 is a tumor suppressor which maintains normal HSC function (23Micol J.B. Pastore A. Inoue D. Duployez N. Kim E. Lee S.C. Durham B.H. Chung Y.R. Cho H. Zhang X.J. Yoshimi A. Krivtsov A. Koche R. Solary E. Sinha A. Preudhomme C. Abdel-Wahab O. ASXL2 is essential for haematopoiesis and acts as a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor in leukemia.Nat.

The functional link between MSI2 and these targets gives us a better idea about the role of MSI2 in hematopoiesis and leukemia. Similarly, targets such as SMG1 and RUNX1, which regulate cell growth in AML (25Du Y. Lu F. Li P. Ye J. Ji M. Ma D. Ji C. SMG1 acts as a novel potential tumor suppressor with epigenetic inactivation in acute myeloid leukemia.Int. J. Mol.

This regulation therefore could explain the increased cell expansion seen in AML patients (27Byers R.J. Currie T. Tholouli E. Rodig S.J. Kutok J.L. MSI2 protein expression predicts unfavorable outcome in acute myeloid leukemia.Blood. 2011; 118 (21753187): 2857-286710.1182/blood-2011-04-346767Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous finding that MSI2 modulates the TGF-β pathway by direct binding to genes such as TGFBR1 and SMAD3, our data add additional targets of MSI2 involved in this pathway such as RAF1, p300, CBP, SMAD5, and SMAD9 (13Park S.M.

Exp. Med. 2014; 211 (24395885): 71-8710.1084/jem.20130736Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our genome-wide pathway analysis revealed targets of MSI2 that regulate important cellular pathways such as eIF2, eIF4/p70S6K, EGF, and HGF. Both the eukaryotic translation initiation factor pathways (eIF2, eIF4 and p70S6K) attribute a translational role to MSI2 protein. The genes included in these pathways, that are bound and regulated by MSI2, are ribosomal proteins including RPL11, RPS7, RPL19, and RPS20, which suggests that MSI2 might be an essential factor in recruiting these proteins for protein translation. Additionally, the two growth factor pathways HGF and EGF in turn regulate central signaling cascades including PI3K-Akt, JAK/STAT, or MAPK"

New Zealand rabbits underwent balloon injury of the abdominal artery and then were assigned to a control group (n = 15, normal chow) or high cholesterol group (n = 25, 1% high cholesterol diet). At weeks 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 after acclimation, rabbits (high cholesterol group, n = 5; control group, n = 3) were euthanized. No lesions were observed in the control group. From week 4 to week 12, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), FGF receptor 1 (FGFR-1), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), the vulnerability index (VI) and the microvessel density (MVD) were significantly elevated in the high cholesterol group; however, PDGF receptor β (PDGFR-β) expression showed little change. Analysis by double-label immunofluorescence (CD31 and Ng2) and FITC-dextran indicated that the neovessels within the plaque were leaky due to a lack of pericytes. As indicated by Pearson's correlation analysis, there was a highly positive correlation between the VI, MVD, macrophage content, and TNF-α level, and the levels of VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 and FGF-2/FGFR-1. However, no correlations were observed between PDGFR-β levels and the VI or MVD. High expression of VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 and FGF-2/FGFR-1 but not of PDGF-BB/PDGFR-β may contribute to immature and inflammatory intraplaque angiogenesis and plaque instability in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis."

In response to dsRNA binding, OAS proteins synthesize the second messenger 2′–5′-linked oligoadenylate that activates the latent ribonuclease L (RNase L). RNase L–mediated degradation of viral and cellular RNAs effectively halts viral replication and further stimulates innate immune responses by inducing type I interferon. The OAS/RNase L pathway is therefore central in innate immune recognition and promotion of antiviral host responses. However, the potential for specific RNA sequences or structures to drive OAS1 activation and the molecular mechanisms by which they act are not currently fully understood. Moreover, the cellular regulators of OAS activity are not well defined. Here, we demonstrate that the human cellular noncoding RNA 886 (nc886) activates OAS1 both in vitro and in human A549 cells. We show that a unique structure present only in one of the two structural conformers adopted by nc886 drives potent OAS1 activation. In contrast, the conformer lacking this unique structure activated OAS1 only very weakly. We also found that formation of this OAS1-activating structural motif depends on the nucleotides in the apical-most loop of nc886 and the adjacent helix. These findings identify a cellular RNA capable of activating the OAS/RNase L pathway in human cells and illustrate the importance of structural elements, and their context, in potentiating OAS1 activity.

OAS enzymes are activated by dsRNA binding and initiate signaling cascades to halt viral replication and establish an antiviral state in the cell.

Recent evidence suggests that basal PKR activity is suppressed by the ubiquitously expressed 101-nucleotide cellular noncoding RNA 886 (nc886; Fig. 1A) to prevent spurious activation in the uninfected cell while allowing rapid detection of foreign dsRNA when required (23.Kunkeaw N.

Our previous work has demonstrated that nc886 RNA adopts two structurally distinct conformers, distinguished by their apical stem-loop structures, that possess opposing activities in the regulation of PKR (26.Calderon B.M. Conn G.L. Human noncoding RNA 886 (nc886) adopts two structurally distinct conformers that are functionally opposing regulators of PKR.RNA. 2017; 23 (28069888): 557-56610.1261/rna.060269.116Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We also previously reported that the mixture of nc886 conformers appeared to strongly activate OAS1 and that this activity was only modestly reduced by deletion of the 3′-single–stranded pyrimidine (3′-ssPy) motif that more significantly potentiates activity by viral noncoding RNAs (27.Vachon V.K. Calderon B.M. Conn G.L. A novel RNA molecular signature for activation of 2′–5′ oligoadenylate synthetase-1.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (25477390): 544-55210.1093/nar/gku1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the two nc886 conformers exhibit profound differences in their capacity to activate the OAS/RNase L pathway: one nc886 conformer is a potent activator of OAS1 in vitro and in human A549 cells whereas the other conformer activates OAS1 only very weakly. We further show that potent activation depends on the nc886 apical stem-loop structure, highlighting the critical importance of RNA structural features, and their context, in potentiating OAS activity. nc886 RNA was previously shown to adopt two stable, structurally distinct conformers (26.Calderon B.M. Conn G.L. Human noncoding RNA 886 (nc886) adopts two structurally distinct conformers that are functionally opposing regulators of PKR.RNA. 2017; 23 (28069888): 557-56610.1261/rna.060269.116Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To dissect the activity of each conformer on OAS1, we purified the individual nc886 conformers by native PAGE. An established in vitro OAS1 activation assay (27.Vachon V.K. Calderon B.M. Conn G.L. A novel RNA molecular signature for activation of 2′–5′ oligoadenylate synthetase-1.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (25477390): 544-55210.1093/nar/gku1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28.Justesen J. Kjeldgaard N.O. Spectrophotometric pyrophosphate assay of 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase.Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207 (1336938): 90-9310.1016/0003-2697(92)90506-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was then used to measure PPi production, the by-product of 2–5A synthesis, in the presence of each nc886 conformer. nc886 conformer 1 strongly activates OAS1 (Fig. 1B), with a level of activity comparable with that measured for poly(rI·rC) under our previously established conditions. Poly(rI·rC) is a synthetic dsRNA that acts as a potent trigger of 2–5A synthesis via activation of OAS/RNase L in vitro and in cells (29.Li Y. Banerjee S. Goldstein S.A. Dong B. Gaughan C. Rath S. Donovan J. Korennykh A. Silverman R.H. Weiss S.R. Ribonuclease L mediates the cell-lethal phenotype of double-stranded RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 deficiency in a human cell line.Elife. 2017; 6Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In stark contrast, nc886 conformer 2 has dramatically attenuated capacity to activate OAS1. However, the low level of OAS1 activation by nc886 conformer 2 is nonetheless comparable with that of some structured viral noncoding RNAs, such as adenovirus VA RNAI and Epstein-Barr virus EBER-1 (27.Vachon V.K. Calderon B.M. Conn G.L. A novel RNA molecular signature for activation of 2′–5′ oligoadenylate synthetase-1.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (25477390): 544-55210.1093/nar/gku1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and greater than two unrelated control RNAs, yeast tRNA or HIV TAR RNA, not expected to activate OAS1 (Fig. 1B). We further probed the ability of each nc886 RNA conformer to promote OAS1 activation using an in vitro OAS1 kinetic analysis of 2–5A synthesis performed over a range of RNA concentrations (Fig. 1, C–E). Initial rates determined from these analyses were used to obtain the kinetic parameters for the apparent RNA dissociation constant (Kapp) and maximum reaction velocity (Vmax) as measures of RNA–OAS1 binding and OAS1 catalytic activity, respectively, for each nc886 RNA conformer. nc886 conformer 1 exhibits a Kapp in the nanomolar range (224 ± 29 nm), whereas that of nc886 conformer 2 was too weak to be determined accurately (> ∼10 μm), resulting in a >50-fold difference between the two nc886 conformers. The OAS1 Vmax measured for nc886 conformer 1 was 11.2 ± 0.6 nmol PPi/min, whereas the data for nc886 conformer 2 could not be reliably fit. Thus, the structural differences in the two conformers dramatically affect the extent of OAS1 activation through effects on both the RNA–OAS1 interaction and OAS1 catalysis, with the most significant impact being on apparent RNA affinity. We next assessed the ability of each nc886 conformer to activate the OAS/RNase L pathway in human A549 cells, which basally express OAS1 and OAS3 (30.Kwon Y.C. Kang J.I. Hwang S.B. Ahn B.Y. The ribonuclease L-dependent antiviral roles of human 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase family members against hepatitis C virus.FEBS Lett. 2013; 587 (23196181): 156-16410.1016/j.febslet.2012.11.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A549 cells were transfected with nc886 conformer 1, nc886 conformer 2, or a truncated version of adenoviral VA RNAI (TSΔ21), an RNA of comparable size (99 nts) to nc886 that was previously shown to very weakly activate OAS1 (31.Wahid A.M.

Native PAGE analysis was used to confirm the conformational homogeneity of each nc886 RNA immediately prior to transfection (Fig. 2A). At 3 h post-transfection, cells were lysed, and total RNA was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to monitor rRNA cleavage by RNase L (Fig. 2B). Transfection with nc886 conformer 1 resulted in significant rRNA degradation, comparable with poly(rI·rC) dsRNA and consistent with strong activation of the OAS/RNase L pathway. In contrast, nc886 conformer 2 showed no detectable rRNA degradation, with rRNA integrity remaining identical to untransfected and mock-transfected controls. Finally, consistent with its known weak activity in vitro (33.Meng H. Deo S. Xiong S. Dzananovic E. Donald L.J. van Dijk C.W. McKenna S.A. Regulation of the interferon-inducible 2′–5′-oligoadenylate synthetases by adenovirus VA(I) RNA.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 422 (22709583): 635-64910.1016/j.jmb.2012.06.017Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), transfection with VA RNAI (TSΔ21) resulted in a small amount of rRNA cleavage. These results thus mirror the relative capacity of each nc886 conformer to activate OAS1 in our in vitro assay (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, nc886-mediated rRNA cleavage activity is completely absent in A549 cells lacking RNase L (RNASEL KO), confirming that the observed rRNA cleavage results exclusively from activation of the OAS/RNase L pathway by nc886 conformer 1 (Fig. 2C). To dissect the contributions of different regions of the RNA to OAS1 activation, four nc886 variants were created (Fig. 3A) with truncations of the terminal stem (ΔTS, deletion of nts 1–12 and 88–101; ΔTS2, deletion of nts 1–18 and 82–101), the terminal stem and the central stem (ΔCS, deletion of nts 1–28 and 70–101), or the apical stem-loop (ΔAS, deletion of nts 37–63). As reported previously (26.Calderon B.M. Conn G.L. Human noncoding RNA 886 (nc886) adopts two structurally distinct conformers that are functionally opposing regulators of PKR.RNA. 2017; 23 (28069888): 557-56610.1261/rna.060269.116Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the ΔAS variant adopts a single conformer, whereas the terminal and central stem variants (ΔTS, ΔTS2, and ΔCS) retain the ability to form two conformers (Fig. 3A). These observations are consistent with conserved terminal and central stem structures between the two WT nc886 conformers and a unique tertiary structure, present in the apical stem-loop of only conformer 1, as the origin of the structural differences between the nc886 conformers (26.Calderon B.M. Conn G.L. Human noncoding RNA 886 (nc886) adopts two structurally distinct conformers that are functionally opposing regulators of PKR.RNA. 2017; 23 (28069888): 557-56610.1261/rna.060269.116Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of each nc886 variant, and each individual RNA conformer where applicable, to activate OAS1 in vitro at a single fixed RNA concentration. These experiments were performed under the same conditions and protein/RNA concentrations as used for WT nc886 (Fig. 1B) and are shown as both reaction progress curves and initial rates of reaction (Fig. 3, B and C, respectively). nc886ΔAS fails to activate OAS1, with the level of 2–5A synthesis comparable with the control reaction with no RNA. This result indicates that the structure formed by the apical stem-loop of nc886 is essential for activation of OAS1. In contrast, conformer 1 of both the ΔTS and ΔTS2 variants retains near WT activity suggesting that in the context of conformer 1, the terminal stem is largely dispensable for OAS1 activation. However, the larger truncation of ΔCS results in a conformer 1 variant with dramatically reduced ability to activate OAS1 (Fig. 3, B and C). Finally, similar to the ΔAS variant, and in contrast to the weakly activating WT nc886 conformer 2, conformer 2 of each terminal or central stem deletion variant completely fails to activate OAS1 (Fig. 3, B and C). Collectively, these data reveal that deletion of the nc886 terminal stem fully ablates OAS1 activation in the context of conformer 2 but has only a very minor impact on the activity of conformer 1 RNAs. Critically, only the largest deletion (ΔCS) significantly impacts OAS1 activation in the context of conformer 1 suggesting that this region forms a critical part of the OAS1-binding site required for potent OAS1 activation. To further examine the role of the nc886 apical stem-loop sequence and structure on OAS1 activation, we created three additional variants with smaller truncations of this region. Using RNA secondary structures of the WT nc886 RNA conformers previously experimentally defined using selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) (26.Calderon B.M. Conn G.L. Human noncoding RNA 886 (nc886) adopts two structurally distinct conformers that are functionally opposing regulators of PKR.RNA. 2017; 23 (28069888): 557-56610.1261/rna.060269.116Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we created variants lacking loop 4 (ΔL4), loop 5 (ΔL5), or loop 5 and the adjacent helix (ΔAS2). Each of these new variants adopted a single conformation as determined by native PAGE analysis (Fig. 4A) suggesting loss of the capacity to form the apical stem-loop structure of conformer 1. RNA variants were also assessed by UV thermal melting analysis, and each was found to more closely resemble WT nc886 conformer 2 in RNA stability (Table 1 and Fig. 4B). We then tested each RNA variant for its ability to activate OAS1 in vitro and found that all apical stem-loop variants failed to activate OAS1 above the level of the control lacking RNA (Fig. 4C). SHAPE analyses were carried out for each RNA variant and compared with previously published SHAPE analyses of the WT nc886 conformers (Fig. 4, D–G). All the apical stem-loop variants closely resemble each other and full-length nc886 conformer 2, aside from the specifically deleted nucleotides. The results for each of these RNAs are thus distinct from full-length nc886 conformer 1, which exhibits loss of loop 5 reactivity and NMIA-independent stops on the 5′-side of the helix adjacent to loop 5, indicative of a stable structure and potential long-range tertiary interactions. Together, these data suggest that the specific apical stem-loop sequence and structure play a critical role in OAS1 activation by either conformer, being essential for both potent activation by conformer 1 and for the weak activation by conformer 2.Table 1Apparent melting temperatures (Tm) for wildtype and variant nc886 unfoldingRNAApparent Tm0.5× TBEHEPES/NaCl°Cnc886 conformer 173.892.2nc886 conformer 238.258.4nc886ΔAS240.961.2nc886ΔL443.663.9nc886ΔL539.059.4 Open table in a new tab To further probe the role of the unique apical-stem loop structure of nc886 conformer 1 in activation of the cellular OAS/RNase L pathway, we transfected human A549 cells with nc886ΔTS2 conformer 1, the smallest RNA variant that retains the unique structural motif and near WT levels of OAS1 activation, or nc886ΔL5, the largest RNA variant that exhibits complete loss of both the unique apical stem-loop structural motif and OAS1 activation in vitro. Consistent with our in vitro data, nc886ΔTS2 conformer 1 triggers rRNA cleavage, whereas nc886ΔL5 fails to activate the OAS/RNase L pathway in human A549 cells (Fig. 5). The ability of ΔTS2 conformer 1 to activate the OAS/RNase L pathway in human A549 cells also suggests that nc886 can act, at least in part, through OAS1 as OAS3 requires longer (>50 bp) dsRNA (11.Donovan J. Whitney G. Rath S. Korennykh A. Structural mechanism of sensing long dsRNA via a noncatalytic domain in human oligoadenylate synthetase 3.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112 (25775560): 3949-395410.1073/pnas.1419409112Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nucleic acid sensing in innate immunity plays a critical role in the detection of viral pathogens. The precise regulation of nucleic acid sensors, such as the OAS family of enzymes, is required for both proper cell function in the absence of infection and survival of viral infection. This work demonstrates the ability of a cellular noncoding RNA, nc886, to regulate OAS through potent activation in vitro and in human A549 cells. However, the two RNA conformers adopted by nc886 induce 2–5A synthesis by OAS1 in vitro to markedly different levels. Although nc886 conformer 2 activates OAS1 only weakly, nc886 conformer 1 potently induces 2–5A synthesis in vitro and RNase L–mediated rRNA cleavage in A549 cells. This is, to our knowledge, the first identification of a cellular RNA activator of OAS and raises questions about the biological roles OAS1 may play outside of innate immunity. The conformational identity of nc886 RNA has profound effects on both RNA–OAS1-binding affinity and OAS1 catalysis. Our kinetic analyses demonstrated a significant impact on apparent affinity with a more than 50-fold difference in Kapp between the two conformers. Moreover, the level of OAS1 catalysis depends on the presence or absence of the predicted tertiary structural motif in the apical stem-loop of nc886 (Fig. 6). OAS1 catalysis in the presence of nc886 conformer 1 appears similar to that previously observed in vitro for defined stem-loop structures derived from the 5′-end of the West Nile Virus genome (34.Deo S. Patel T.R. Dzananovic E. Booy E.P. Zeid K. McEleney K. Harding S.E. McKenna S.A. Activation of 2′–5′-oligoadenylate synthetase by stem loops at the 5′-end of the West Nile Virus genome.PLoS One. 2014; 9 (24651762): e9254510.1371/journal.pone.0092545Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) further supporting the idea that specific RNA structural features, in addition to dsRNA, can activate OAS1. In contrast, nc886 conformer 2 has dramatically attenuated capacity to activate OAS1, and as such, kinetic analyses could not accurately determine Vmax. This weak catalysis, however, mirrors that observed for viral noncoding RNAs produced by Epstein-Barr virus and adenovirus (27.Vachon V.K. Calderon B.M. Conn G.L.

The muscle strength can be measured using different dynamometers and be evaluated in three positions (side-lying, standing, and supine). Obtained strength data can be expressed in different ways, with data normalization providing more objective and comparable results. The aim of this study was to establish the validity and reliability of three protocols in evaluating the isometric strength of the hip abductor muscles. A new functional electromechanical dynamometer assessed strength in three positions, with findings subjected to three data normalization methods. In two identical sessions, the hip abductor strengths of 29 subjects were recorded in the side-lying, standing, and supine positions. Peak force was recorded in absolute terms and normalized against body mass, fat-free mass, and an allometric technique. The peak force recorded in the side-lying position was 30% and 27% higher than in the standing and supine positions, respectively, independent of data normalization methodology. High inter-protocol correlations were found (r: 0.72 to 0.98, p ≤ 0.001). The supine position with allometric data normalization had the highest test-retest reliability (0.94 intraclass correlation coefficient and 5.64% coefficient of variation). In contrast, the side-lying position with body mass data normalization had a 0.66 intraclass correlation coefficient and 9.8% coefficient of variation. In conclusion, the functional electromechanical dynamometer is a valid device for measuring isometric strength in the hip abductor muscles. The three assessed positions are reliable, although the supine position with allometric data normalization provided the best results."
https://openalex.org/W2888756718,"Studies have shown that stress-related catecholamines may affect cancer progression. However, little is known about catecholamine secretion profiles in head and neck cancer patients. The present study investigated plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients and patients with oral leukoplakia, as well as their association with clinicopathological and biobehavioral variables and anxiety symptoms. A total of 93 patients with HNSCC and 32 patients with oral leukoplakia were included. Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels were measured by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED), and psychological anxiety levels were measured by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations were significantly higher in patients with oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared to non-cancer patients. Oral SCC patients displayed plasma norepinephrine levels about six times higher than oropharyngeal SCC patients, and nine times higher than oral leukoplakia patients (p < .001). Plasma epinephrine levels in oral SCC patients were higher compared to the oropharyngeal SCC (p = .0097) and leukoplakia (p < .0001) patients. Oropharyngeal SCC patients had higher plasma norepinephrine (p = .0382) and epinephrine levels (p = .045) than patients with oral leukoplakia. Multiple regression analyses showed that a history of high alcohol consumption was predictive for reduced plasma norepinephrine levels in the oral SCC group (p < .001). Anxiety symptom of ""hand tremor"" measured by the BAI was an independent predictor for higher plasma norepinephrine levels in HNSCC patients (β = 157.5, p = .0377), while the ""heart pounding/racing"" symptom was independently associated with higher plasma epinephrine levels in the oropharyngeal SCC group (β = 15.8, p = .0441). In oral leukoplakia patients, sleep deprivation and worse sleep quality were independent predictors for higher plasma norepinephrine levels, while severe tobacco consumption and higher anxiety levels were factors for higher plasma epinephrine levels. These findings suggest that head and neck cancer patients display sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity, and that changes in circulating catecholamines may be associated with alcohol consumption, as well as withdrawal-related anxiety symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2888170508,"The anecdotal evidence is outstanding on the uses of Aristolochia plants as traditional medicines and dietary supplements in many regions of the world. However, herbal materials derived from Aristolochia species have been identified as potent human carcinogens since the first case of severe renal disease after ingesting these herbal preparations. Any products containing Aristolochia species have thus been banned on many continents, including Europe, America and Asia. Therefore, the development of a method to identify these herbs is critically needed for customer safety. The present study evaluated DNA barcoding of the rbcL, matK, ITS2 and trnH-psbA regions among eleven Aristolochia species collected in Thailand. Polymorphic sites were observed in all four DNA loci. Among those eleven Aristolochia species, three species (A. pierrei, A. tagala and A. pothieri) are used as herbal materials in Thai folk medicine, namely, in Thai “Krai-Krue”. “Krai-Krue” herbs are interchangeably used as an admixture in Thai traditional remedies without specific knowledge of their identities. A species-specific multiplex PCR based on nucleotide polymorphisms in the ITS2 region was developed as an identification tool to differentiate these three Aristolochia species and to supplement the HPTLC pattern in clarifying the origins of herbal materials. The combination of multiplex PCR and HPTLC profiling achieves accurate herbal identification with the goal of protecting consumers from the health risks associated with product substitution and contamination."

Because lifestyles and body composition are quite different between Western and Asian countries, there is an urgent need to establish normative grip strength values for individuals of Asian descent. This study presents normative data for hand grip strength in a Korean population-representative sample.A sample of 11,073 individuals (age 10-80 years) was included from the Sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2014-2015. Isometric grip strength was assessed using a handheld dynamometer. Relative grip strength was calculated as the maximum absolute grip strength divided by body mass index. Means, standard error, and quintiles for grip strength and relative grip strength were analyzed per 5-year age group for each sex. To create growth charts for grip strength and relative grip strength, parametric quantile regression was used.In males, absolute grip strength increased quickly starting from 10 years of age until approximately 20 years of age. In females, there was gradual growth until approximately 15 years of age. Grip strength continued to increase until a peak between ages 30 and 39 years, and then declined from midlife onwards in both sexes. Our data showed that the prevalence of weak grip strength increased rapidly in late adult life based on a T-score of -2 standard deviations below the sex-specific peak mean (equivalent to 33 kg in males and 20 kg in females). Approximately 20% of subjects had weak grip strength at age 65-69 years.This was the first study to establish normative reference values for grip strength across the lifespan in a Korean population aged 10-80 years. Percentiles of grip strength will inform clinical assessments and will help identify thresholds for the identification of muscle weakness."

By using membrane models mimicking P. aeruginosa plasma membrane composition (POPE:POPG:CL), we demonstrated the ability of 3'6-dinonylneamine to induce changes in the biophysical properties of membrane model lipid systems in a cardiolipin dependent manner. These changes include an increased membrane permeability associated with a reduced hydration and a decreased ability of membrane to mix and fuse as shown by monitoring calcein release, Generalized Polarization of Laurdan and fluorescence dequenching of octadecyl rhodamine B, respectively. Altogether, results shed light on how cardiolipin may be critical for improving antibacterial action of new amphiphilic aminoglycoside derivatives."

However, the influence of ovarian endometriosis (OMA) on ovarian responsiveness to hyperstimulation has not been clearly established.To evaluate the risk of a poor ovarian response (POR) to stimulation and ART outcomes in women with OMA.We conducted a large observational controlled matched cohort study in a tertiary care university hospital between 01/10/2012 and 31/12/2015. After matching by age and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, 201 infertile women afflicted with OMA (the OMA group) and 402 disease-free women (the control group) undergoing an ART procedure were included in the study. The main outcomes that we measured were a POR to hyperstimulation (i.e., ≤ 3 oocytes retrieved, or cancelled cycles), the clinical pregnancy rate, and the live birth rate. All of the women with endometriosis underwent a pre-ART work-up, in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and staging of their disease. An OMA diagnosis was based on published imaging criteria (obtained by transvaginal sonography or magnetic resonance imaging) or on histological analysis for patients with a prior history of endometriosis surgery. The statistical analyses were conducted using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.The incidence of a POR to hyperstimulation was significantly higher for the OMA group than for the control group [62/201 (30.8%) versus 90/402 (22.3%), respectively; p = 0.02]. However, no significant differences were found between the OMA and the control group in terms of the clinical pregnancy rate [53/151 (35%) versus 134/324 (41.3%), respectively; p = 0.23] and the live birth rate [39/151 (25.8%) versus 99/324 (30.5%), respectively; p = 0.33]. By multivariate analysis, a prior history of surgery for OMA was found to be an independent factor associated with a POR to stimulation [OR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.1-4.0], unlike OMA without a prior history of surgery [OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 0.9-2.2].The presence of OMA during ART treatment increased the risk of a POR to hyperstimulation, although the live birth rate was not affected. Furthermore, having OMA and having previously undergone surgery for OMA was identified as an independent risk factor for a POR."

Here, we brought desert organisms together (rodents and vipers) from two deserts (Mojave and Negev). Both predators and prey in the Mojave have adaptations that give them competitive advantage compared to their middle-eastern counterparts. Heteromyid rodents of the Mojave, kangaroo rats and pocket mice, have fur-lined cheek pouches that allow them to carry larger loads of seeds under predation risk compared to gerbilline rodents of the Negev Deserts. Sidewinder rattlesnakes have heat-sensing pits, allowing them to hunt better on moonless nights when their Negev sidewinding counterpart, the Saharan horned vipers, are visually impaired. In behavioral-assays, we used giving-up density (GUD) to gauge how each species of rodent perceived risk posed by known and novel snakes. We repeated this for the same set of rodents at first encounter and again two months later following intensive “natural” exposure to both snake species. Pre-exposure, all rodents identified their evolutionarily familiar snake as a greater risk than the novel one. However, post-exposure all identified the heat-sensing sidewinder rattlesnake as a greater risk. The heteromyids were more likely to avoid encounters with, and discern the behavioral difference among, snakes than their gerbilline counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W2888460616,"Many urban indicators and functional citywide properties have been shown to scale with population due to agglomeration effects. We hypothesize that scaling relations may also exist for water-related urban indicators such as the water footprint. The water footprint is an indicator of water use that measures humans' appropriation of freshwater resources. We analyze the scaling of the water footprint for 65 mid- to large-sized US cities using both empirical estimates and a social interaction network model of city functioning. The network model is used to explain the presence of any scaling exponent in the empirical estimates of the urban water footprint by linking to previous theories of urban scaling. We find that the urban water footprint tends to approximately show sublinear scaling behavior with both population and gross domestic product. Thus, large cities tend to be more water footprint efficient and productive than mid-sized cities, where efficiency and productivity are quantified, in a broad sense, as deviations from a linear scaling exponent. We find the sublinear scaling may be linked to changes in urban economic structure with city size, which lead to large cities shifting water intensive economic activities to less populated regions. In addition, we find that green water contributes to the scaling both positively by transferring the dependence of food consumption on population into the water footprint and negatively by increasing heterogeneity. Overall, the proposed scaling relations allow for the comparison of water footprint efficiency and productivity of cities. Comparing these properties and identifying deviations from the expected behavior has implications for water resources and urban sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W2888646333,"Objective Dedicated regional psychiatric emergency services (PES) were proposed as a better care model for psychiatric emergencies and a possible solution to boarding of psychiatric patients in the emergency department. However, there are limited data on factors associated with prolonged length of stay (LOS) in the PES. The objective of this study was finding factors associated with prolonged LOS in the PES and moving towards a solution to this problem. Methods The study sample comprised 200 PES visits randomly chosen from January 2011 to December 2015 in a psychiatric hospital in Taiwan. Relevant data were collected comprehensively through the health information system and by reviewing medical records. The primary outcome was LOS longer than 24 hours while LOS longer than 48 hours was used as the secondary outcome. Results Mean LOS was 17.6±23.2 hours, with 53 (26.5%) visits lasting more than 24 hours and 15 (7.5%) visits lasting more than 48 hours. After adjusting for related confounders, LOS longer than 24 hours was associated with use of restraints in the PES (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.13, 95% CI = 1.59–6.15) and history of illicit substance use (aOR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.11–5.44). LOS longer than 48 hours was associated with use of restraints in the PES (aOR = 4.11, 95% CI = 1.2–14.14), history of illicit substance use (aOR = 6.16, 95% CI = 1.37–27.62) and first time visit to the hospital (aOR = 8.54, 95% CI = 2.03–35.96). Neither outcome was associated with transfer to an inpatient unit. Conclusion Prolonged LOS was common in the study sample. Discharged patients had an equally high rate of prolonged LOS as admitted patients. Therefore measures should be taken to facilitate timely discharge. Use of restraints and history of illicit substance use were common among patients with prolonged LOS."
https://openalex.org/W2888495372,"Recruitment of poliovirus (PV) RNA to the human ribosome requires the coordinated interaction of the viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and several host cellular initiation factors and IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs). Attenuated PV Sabin strains contain point mutations in the PV IRES domain V (dV) that inhibit viral translation. Remarkably, attenuation is most apparent in cells of the central nervous system, but the molecular basis to explain this is poorly understood. The dV contains binding sites for eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and polypyrimidine tract–binding protein (PTB). Impaired binding of these proteins to the mutant IRESs has been observed, but these effects have not been quantitated. We used a fluorescence anisotropy assay to reveal that the Sabin mutants reduce the equilibrium dissociation constants of eIF4G and PTB to the PV IRES by up to 6-fold. Using the most inhibitory Sabin 3 mutant, we used a real-time fluorescence helicase assay to show that the apparent affinity of an active eIF4G/4A/4B helicase complex for the IRES is reduced by 2.5-fold. The Sabin 3 mutant did not alter the maximum rate of eIF4A-dependent helicase activity, suggesting that this mutant primarily reduces the affinity, rather than activity, of the unwinding complex. To confirm this affinity model of attenuation, we show that eIF4G overexpression in HeLa cells overcomes the attenuation of a Sabin 3 mutant PV–luciferase replicon. Our study provides a quantitative framework for understanding the mechanism of PV Sabin attenuation and provides an explanation for the previously observed cell type–specific translational attenuation."
https://openalex.org/W2888529985,"The skin harbors diverse communities of microorganisms, and alterations to these communities can impact the effectiveness of the skin as a barrier to infectious organisms or injury. As the global availability and adoption of antibacterial products increases, it is important to understand how these products affect skin microbial communities of people living in rural areas of developing countries, where risks of infection and injury often differ from urban populations in developed countries. We investigated the effect of antibacterial soap on skin microbial communities in a rural Malagasy population that practices subsistence agriculture in the absence of electricity and running water. We quantified the amount of soap used by each participant and obtained skin swab samples at three time points: prior to soap use, immediately after one week of soap use, and two weeks after soap use was discontinued. Soap use did not significantly impact ecological measures of diversity and richness (alpha diversity). However, the amount of soap used was a predictor of community-level change (beta diversity), with changes persisting for at least two weeks after subjects stopped using soap. Our results indicate that the overall species richness of skin microbial communities may be resistant to short-term use of antibacterial soap in settings characterized by regular contact with the natural environment, yet these communities may undergo shifts in microbial composition. Lifestyle changes associated with the use of antibacterial soap may therefore cause rapid alterations in skin microbial communities, with the potential for effects on skin health."

The most common species, I. brasiliensis, has a wide geographic distribution and is found in subtemperate and tropical seas circumglobally. A comparative analysis of specimens from different localities throughout its range, however, had never been undertaken. In the present paper, the morphological variation of this species along its entire distribution has been thoroughly analyzed, corroborating that it represents a single widespread species and that I. labialis is its junior synonym. The other congeneric species, I. plutodus, is known from only a few specimens and is also distributed worldwide. A detailed comparative analysis of available material of I. plutodus was conducted verifying its validity as a single widespread species. The present study analyzed in detail the external morphology (coloration, dentition, dermal denticles), internal morphology (skeleton, musculature), lateral-line canals, and morphometric and meristic characters of species of Isistius in order to better define the genus and its included valid species."
https://openalex.org/W2888678043,"Universal hepatitis B (HB) vaccination among Thai newborns was initiated in 1992. The first dose of the monovalent HB vaccine was given at birth, then at months 2 and 6 simultaneously with the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis whole-cell (DTPw) vaccine. In 2008, Thailand replaced the monovalent HB vaccine at months 2 and 6 with a combined DTP-HB given at months 2, 4, and 6, with an added monovalent HB vaccine at month 1 for infants whose mothers were HBV carriers. Despite this rigorous HB vaccination schedule, vaccinated infants who are now adolescents do not possess a protective level of anti-HB surface antigen (anti-HBs) (≥10 mIU/ml). Thus, many young adults may be rendered susceptible to HB infection. Our objective was to determine how HB booster vaccination may benefit high-risk adolescents. We evaluated the serological records of a cohort of medical students (n = 291), which showed that 271 students (93.1%) possessed anti-HBs less than the accepted protective level (<10 mIU/ml) and subsequently received the HB vaccine booster prior to medical school enrollment. We then examined the anti-HB surface antibody (anti-HBs) in 216 individuals six weeks after they were immunized. We found that 61%, 88%, and 94% of individuals with pre-booster anti-HBs of <1 mIU/ml, 1-<3 mIU/ml, and 3-<10 mIU/ml achieved protective anti-HBs, respectively. Post-booster geometric mean titers were 305, 513, and 1,929 mIU/ml in these groups and correlated with pre-booster anti-HBs titers. These data suggest that medical students with known anti-HBs <1 mIU/ml will benefit from 3 doses of HB vaccine at 0, 1, and 6 months. Students with anti-HBs 1-<10 mIU/ml would benefit from an HB vaccine booster without further anti-HBs evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2888114721,"Zoledronic acid (ZA) exerts complex influence on bone by suppressing bone resorption, mostly due to the direct osteoclasts inhibition and uncertain influence on osteoblasts. Vitamin K2 (VK2, Menaquinone-4) as an anabolic agent stimulates bone formation via anti-apoptosis in osteoblasts and mild osteoclasts inhibition. Based on these knowledge, the therapeutic effect of the combined or sequential therapy of VK2 and ZA depends on the influence on the osteoblasts, since both cases exert similar inhibitory effect on osteoclasts. In a series of in vitro studies, we confirmed the protective effect of VK2 in osteoblasts culture, especially when followed by exposure to ZA, and the proliferation and mineralization inhibition induced by ZA towards osteoblasts. For mechanism study, expression of bcl-2/bax, Runx2 and Sost in cells were examined. For in vivo studies, an osteoporosis animal model was established in rats via ovariectomy (OVX) and subjected to sequential treatment, namely VK2 followed by ZA. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by Dual energy X-ray absorptionmetry (DEXA), morphology and mechanical parameters by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), mechanical strength by an electro-hydraulic fatigue-testing machine. The bone calcium, hydroxyproline content, blood lipids were evaluated using microplate technique, and the bone surface turnover was evaluated using the fluorescence in corporation method. It was found that VK2 pretreatment partially prevented the inhibition of bone formation caused by ZA, which was reflected by indices like BMD, bone calcium content and bone strength. The underling mechanisms for protection of VK2 pretreatment, mainly demonstrated via in vitro studies, included inhibiting apoptosis and depressing Sost expression in osteoblasts, which in turn improved the osteoporosis therapeutic effects of ZA. These findings suggested that pretreatment with VK2 before ZA therapy might serve a new long-term therapy protocol for osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2888606595,"Background Much work on reducing ED utilization has focused on primary care practices, but few studies have examined ED visits from patients followed by specialists, especially when the ED visit is related to the specialist’s clinical practice. Objective To determine the proportion and characteristics of patients that utilized the ED for specialty-related diagnosis. Methods Retrospective, population-based, cohort study was conducted using information from electronic health records and billing database between January 2016 and December 2016. Patients who had seen a specialist during the last five years from the index ED visit date were included. The identification of ED visits attributable to specialists was based on the primary diagnosis of ED visits and the frequency of visit with specialists within a given timeframe. Results Approximately 28% of ED visits analyzed were attributable to specialists. ED visits attributed specialists were represented by older patients and occurred more during working hours and early days of week. The most common diagnoses related to ED visits attributed to specialists were Circulatory, Musculoskeletal, Skin, Breast and Mental. Multiple departments, subdivisions and specialists were involved with each ED visit. The number of specialists following the patients who visited the ED ranged from one to six and the number of departments/subdivisions ranged from one to four. Patients that used the ED often were more likely to belong to departments (OR = 1.53) and specialists (OR = 1.18) associated with high ED utilization patterns. Conclusion Patients coming to the ED with specialty-related complaints are unique and require full engagement of the specialist and the specialty group. This study offers a new view of connections patients have with their specialists and engaging specialists both at department level and individual specialist level may be an important factor to reduce ED overcrowding."
https://openalex.org/W2888098873,"Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) is a mainstay of therapy in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and obstructive cholestasis. Patients with liver cirrhosis have an increased risk of surgical complications and are more susceptible to infections. Since PSC often progresses to cirrhosis, we aimed to assess whether ERC is associated with increased risk of complications in patients with PSC and cirrhosis.Out of 383 patients with PSC, 208 patients received endoscopic treatment between 2009-2017. Seventy patients had cirrhosis when ERC was performed and 138 patients had no signs of cirrhosis. Overall, 663 ERC procedures were analysed, with 250 ERC in patients with cirrhosis and 413 ERC in patients without cirrhosis. Data were analysed retrospectively from a prospectively acquired database using repeated measures logistic regression.Overall, 40 procedure-related complications were documented in 663 ERC interventions (6%). The rate of complications was similar between patients with and without cirrhosis (4.4% vs. 7.0%). First-time ERC was associated with a higher risk of complications (17.5% vs. 4.9%). Biliary sphincterotomy, stent placement and female sex, but not presence of liver cirrhosis, were identified as risk factors for overall complications in multivariate analysis. Patients without cirrhosis showed a significant decline of ALP and bilirubin levels after the first two interventions. In contrast, in patients with cirrhosis, ALP and bilirubin levels did not significantly decline after ERC.In patients with PSC, cirrhosis was not a risk factor for post-ERC complications. Therefore, cirrhosis should not preclude endoscopic intervention in patients with clear clinical indication."
https://openalex.org/W2888695091,"Small wear particles (0.1–10 μm) in total joint replacement are generally considered as the major causative agent leading to periprosthetic inflammation and osteolysis. However, little is known about the roles of larger wear particles (10–100 μm) in periprosthetic inflammation and osteolysis. Additionally, although ample studies demonstrated that increased oxidative stress is critically involved in particle-induced inflammation and osteolysis, detailed changes in antioxidant enzymes expression in the disease development remain largely unclear. Herein, we used a rat knee prosthesis model to assess effects of polyethylene (PE) particles (20–60 μm) on the levels of oxidative stress markers such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in blood plasma, and on the expression profiles of antioxidant enzymes in knee joint tissues. In combination with a forced-exercise intervention for all surgical rats, we found that the rat groups treated with both artificial joint and PE particles exhibited higher MDA levels and lower TAC levels, together with lower levels of physical activity and higher levels of inflammatory markers, than the sham group and the groups receiving artificial joint or PE particles alone at weeks 20–24 post-operatively. Dose-response relationships between the exposure to PE particles and the induction of oxidative stress and inflammation were also observed in the artificial joint/PE groups. Under such conditions, we unexpectedly found that most of antioxidant enzymes displayed pronounced up-regulation, with concomitant induction of inflammatory and osteoclast-inducing factors (including IL-1β, NF-κB and RANKL), in the artificial joint/PE groups as compared to the sham, artificial joint only, or PE only group. Only a few antioxidant enzymes including SOD2 and GPx2 showed down-regulation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that implantation of artificial joint along with large PE particles synergistically trigger the induction of oxidative stress; however, down-regulation of many antioxidant enzymes may not necessarily occur during the disease development."

The protein catalyzing this reduction is the last unidentified enzyme in the biosynthetic pathways for all of the green sulfur bacterial pigments used for photosynthesis.

Furthermore, bioinformatic analyses of the genome of B. viridis, and subsequent genetic manipulations reveal that a second, independently evolved carotenoid 1,2-reductase must exist in nature. A previous study demonstrated that, of the two paralogs of the BChl biosynthesis gene, bchP, ORF CT2256 encodes an active BchP enzyme, whereas the role of the protein encoded by CT1232 (annotated as bchO) could not be established (20Gomez Maqueo Chew A. Frigaard N.-U. Bryant D.A. Identification of the bchP gene, encoding geranylgeranyl reductase in Chlorobaculum tepidum.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190 (17993528): 747-74910.1128/JB.01430-07Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The BchP and BchO proteins group with the FixC superfamily of electron-transfer, flavin-dependent reductases (21Edgren T. Nordlund S. The fixABCX genes in Rhodospirillum rubrum encode a putative membrane complex participating in electron transfer to nitrogenase.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186 (15028689): 2052-206010.1128/JB.186.7.2052-2060.2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and are members of the larger NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold superfamily. BchP sequentially reduces three C=C bonds of the isoprenoid alcohol attached to a bacteriochlorin macrocycle, and ChlP performs the same function in the biosynthesis of Chls, converting the geranylgeranyl moiety to phytyl (22Addlesee H.A. Gibson L.C. Jensen P.-E. Hunter C.N. Cloning, sequencing and functional assignment of the chlorophyll biosynthesis gene, chlP, of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.FEBS Lett. 1996; 389 (8766814): 126-13010.1016/0014-5793(96)00549-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2). C40 carotenoids are synthesized from two molecules of the isoprenoid compound, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, and thus the reaction to reduce the 1,2 (or 1′,2′) C=C bond, such as that carried by 1′,2′-dihydrochlorobactene in C. tepidum, is reminiscent of the reduction reactions catalyzed by BchP. To determine whether bchO encodes a carotenoid 1,2-reductase, the CT1232 ORF was interrupted by insertional inactivation with an aadA cassette that confers resistance to spectinomycin; the interruption was confirmed by colony PCR (Fig. S3) and subsequent sequencing of the DNA amplicon. The resulting strain, ΔbchO, was grown in liquid medium, the accumulated pigments were extracted, and, along with those from the WT, were analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 2). As expected, 1′,2′-dihydrochlorobactene was detected in the WT. Disruption of bchO abolished the production of 1′,2′-dihydrochlorobactene, indicating that BchO plays a role in the reduction of the 1′,2′ double bond in carotenoids of C. tepidum. The synthesis of all other carotenoids in C. tepidum was unaffected. The purple phototrophic bacterium B. viridis is the only organism other than C. tepidum that has been documented to produce 1,2-dihydrocarotenoids, utilizing 1,2-dihydroneurosporene as its major carotenoid (23Malhotra H.C. Britton G. Goodwin T.W. Occurrence of 1,2-dihydro-carotenoids in Rhodopseudomonas viridis.J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm. 1970; : 127-128Crossref Google Scholar). The 15,15′-cis isomer of this carotenoid is found in the RC, and 1,2-dihydrolycopene is also detected as a minor pigment (24Qian P. Siebert C.A. Wang P. Canniffe D.P. Hunter C.N. Cryo-EM structure of the Blastochloris viridis LH1-RC complex at 2.9 Å.Nature. 2018; 556 (29618818): 203-20810.1038/s41586-018-0014-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. S4). The presumptive precursor for the major carotenoid of B. viridis, neurosporene, accumulates to high levels in a ΔcrtC mutant of the model purple phototrophic bacterium, R. sphaeroides (25Chi S.C. Mothersole D.J. Dilbeck P. Niedzwiedzki D.M. Zhang H. Qian P. Vasilev C. Grayson K.J. Jackson P.J. Martin E.C. Li Y. Holten D. Hunter C.N.

This mutant can serve as a platform in which to test whether the gene products of GSB bchO genes are sufficient to reduce the 1,2 C=C bonds of a carotenoid, by using pigments extracted from B. viridis as standards for the product(s) of the reaction. The bchP and bchO genes from C. tepidum (bchPCtep and bchOCtep), along with bchP and the three bchO paralogs found in the genome of the brown-colored, BChl e-producing C. limnaeum (bchPClim and bchO1-3Clim, where bchO1Clim encodes a protein most similar to BchOCtep), were cloned into the pBBRBB–Ppuf843–1200 plasmid (26Tikh I.B. Held M. Schmidt-Dannert C. BioBrick™ compatible vector system for protein expression in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2014; 98 (24509770): 3111-311910.1007/s00253-014-5527-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), in which transcription is controlled by the promoter found upstream of the genes encoding the core light-harvesting antenna (LH1) and RC subunits in R. sphaeroides (27Gong L. Kaplan S. Translational control of puf operon expression in Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1.Microbiology. 1996; 142 (8760918): 2057-206910.1099/13500872-142-8-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These plasmids were conjugated into the ΔcrtC mutant of R. sphaeroides, the resulting strains were grown in liquid medium, and carotenoids were extracted and analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 3). As expected, the ΔcrtC mutant primarily accumulated neurosporene, as well as a smaller amount of lycopene. The strains expressing bchPCtep and bchPClim made the same carotenoids as the ΔcrtC mutant. The strains expressing bchOCtep and bchO2Clim made small amounts of 1,2-dihydroneurosporene, the level in the latter strain being just above the limit of detection. The strain expressing bchO1Clim accumulated 1,2-dihydroneurosporene at close to the same level as neurosporene, and both 15,15′-cis-1,2-dihydroneurosporene and 1,2-dihydrolycopene were also detected (Fig. 3). Dihydrocarotenoids were not detected in the strain expressing bchO3Clim. To confirm the activities of these BchP proteins as BChl reductases and to test any potential activity of BchO on BChl, these plasmids were transformed into a ΔbchP mutant of R. sphaeroides (28Ortega-Ramos M. Canniffe D.P. Radle M.I. Hunter C.N. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. Engineered biosynthesis of bacteriochlorophyll gF in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.Biochim. Biophys.

Expression of GSB bchP genes in this background restored synthesis of BChl a esterified with phytol, although complete conversion to the mature pigment was not achieved; products with one and two reduced double bonds were also detected. The elution profiles from strains expressing bchO orthologs were identical to that of the ΔbchP mutant, indicating that these GSB genes do not encode enzymes able to reduce the alcohol moieties of BChl a. These results establish that BchO can act as a carotenoid 1,2-reductase and indicate that the enzyme is not involved in the biosynthesis of BChls. A conserved ORF found in the photosynthesis gene clusters of many purple phototrophic bacteria is also annotated as bchO (29Kumka J.E. Bauer C.E. Analysis of the FnrL regulon in Rhodobacter capsulatus reveals limited regulon overlap with orthologues from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Escherichia coli.BMC Genomics. 2015; 16 (26537891): 89510.1186/s12864-015-2162-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), although the encoded proteins share no similarity to BchO of GSB. We therefore propose, according to Demerec nomenclatural rules, that the GSB bchO genes be renamed cruI to reflect their herein established role in carotenoid biosynthesis. We further propose to eliminate the use of bchO with respect to the paralogous ORFs in those GSB for which no function can currently be assigned. We suggest that only locus tags be used to identify those ORFs. To investigate the evolutionary relationship between BchP and CruI, orthologs of each were identified in the species listed in Table S1, through the use of the C. tepidum protein sequences as queries in Blastp searches of the respective proteomes. The phylogenetic relationships among BchP, CruI, and their paralogs are shown in Fig. 5. The tree supports the assertion that cruI is paralogous to bchP but that it may have arisen through horizontal gene transfer from a purple phototrophic bacterium, because the GSB CruIs are more closely related to purple bacterial BchPs than those within GSB. Interestingly, the only cruI-like gene identified in an organism other than GSB was found in Gemmatimonas phototrophica, a recently discovered member of the Gemmatimonadetes, the seventh bacterial phylum to contain a chlorophototroph (30Zeng Y. Feng F. Medová H. Dean J. Koblížek M. Functional type 2 photosynthetic reaction centers found in the rare bacterial phylum Gemmatimonadetes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111 (24821787): 7795-780010.1073/pnas.1400295111Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). G. phototrophica acquired its phototrophic capability via horizontal gene transfer of the photosynthesis gene cluster from a purple chlorophototroph (31Zeng Y. Koblížek M. Phototrophic Gemmatimonadetes: a new “purple” branch on the bacterial tree of life.in: Hallenbeck P.C. Modern Topics in the Phototrophic Prokaryotes: Environmental and Applied Aspects. Springer, Cham, Switzerland2017: 163-192Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar); the presence of this paralog in G. phototrophica raises interesting questions about its origin. The phylogenetic analysis detailed above identified homologs of cruI in additional GSB, although these genes are not completely conserved in this phylum. This suggested that other GSB may contain active carotenoid 1′,2′-reductases. To test this hypothesis, the identified ORFs (from C. parvum, Chloroherpeton thalassium, Prosthecochloris aestuarii, and Chlorobium clathratiforme) were subsequently tested in the R. sphaeroides ΔcrtC mutant in the same manner described above. Additionally, an apparent bchP paralog present in the genome of G. phototrophica was also tested (Fig. S5). The expression of these bchP/cruI homologs in the ΔcrtC mutant did not result in the production of 1,2-dihydroneurosporene. It may be that these proteins display stricter substrate specificity than those from C. tepidum and C. limnaeum, only catalyzing the reduction of chlorobactene, γ-carotene, or some other compound (e.g. Chl a or a lipid). However, 1,2-dihydrocarotenoids have not been reported in these GSB strains, and dihydrocarotenoids do not seem to be present in G. phototrophica (32Zeng Y. Selyanin V. Lukeš M. Dean J. Kaftan D.

The recently sequenced genome of B. viridis, the only strain outside the GSB documented to produce carotenoids reduced at the 1,2 position, does not contain cruI (33Liu L.N. Faulkner M. Liu X. Huang F. Darby A.C. Hall N. Revised genome sequence of the purple photosynthetic bacterium Blastochloris viridis.Genome Announc. 2016; 4 (26798090): e01520-e01615PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the carotenoids depicted in Fig. S4, B. viridis utilizes BChl b as its primary photopigment (34Drews G. Giesbrecht P. Rhodopseudomonas viridis, nov. spec., ein neu isoliertes, obligat phototrophes Bakterium.Arch. Mikrobiol. 1966; 53 (5991629): 255-26210.1007/BF00446672Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and bacteriopheophytin (BPheo) b, a demetallated analog of its parent BChl that acts as the primary electron acceptor in type-2 RCs (35Klimov V.V. Discovery of pheophytin function in the photosynthetic energy conversion as the primary electron acceptor of photosystem II.Photosynth. Res. 2003; 76 (16228584): 247-25310.1023/A:1024990408747Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Both of these pigments carry a reduced phytyl moiety (36Scheer H. Svec W.A. Cope B.T. Studier M.H. Scott R.G. Katz J.J. Structure of bacteriochlorophyll b.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974; 96: 3714-371610.1021/ja00818a092Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and thus B. viridis must contain an active BchP. Because cruI is a paralog of bchP and catalyzes a similar reductive reaction, the B. viridis bchP (BVIR_564) gene was deleted to determine whether the encoded protein is a bifunctional BChl/carotenoid reductase. The gene was replaced at its start codon with the aadA gene, and this replacement was confirmed by colony PCR (Fig. S6) and subsequent sequencing of the DNA amplicon. The resulting strain, ΔbchP, was cultured in liquid medium, and the accumulated pigments were extracted and, along with those from the WT, analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 6). Deletion of bchP results in shifts in retention for both the major BChl b peak and the minor BPheo b peak to shorter times, consistent with the effect of mutations of chlP/bchP genes in organisms synthesizing Chl a/BChl a (37Shpilyov A.V.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181 (10572128): 7248-7255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). The BChl b and BPheo b in the ΔbchP mutant should now be esterified with geranylgeraniol rather than phytol, indicating that the activity of BchP has been abolished. The carotenoids from this strain were also analyzed; although the levels of lycopene and 1,2-dihydrolycopene are reduced in ΔbchP relative to the WT, both carotenoids were still detected. The major carotenoid in ΔbchP is 1,2-dihydroneurosporene. These results indicate that BchP in B. viridis is solely utilized for the synthesis of BChl b carrying a reduced esterifying alcohol moiety and that it is not responsible for the production of 1,2-dihydrocarotenoids in this organism. Our identification of CruI as a 1,2-carotenoid reductase in C. tepidum completes the pathways for the biosynthesis of carotenoids in GSB, and thus the pathways for the synthesis of all photosynthetic pigments in the Chlorobiaceae (GSB) are now known. Orthologs of cruI are irregularly found throughout the GSB, although the detection of 1,2-dihydrocarotenoids has not been reported for any additional GSB species. It may be that these cruI genes are redundant in these species. C. clathratiforme is a brown-colored GSB, synthesizing BChl e as well as dicyclic carotenoids such as those depicted in Fig. S1; these carotenoids do not have ψ-end groups available for reduction, so redundancy of cruI from this strain is unsurprising. However, C. limnaeum also accumulates BChl e and dicyclic carotenoids (10Hirabayashi H. Ishii T. Takaichi S. Inoue K. Uehara K. The role of carotenoids in the photoadaptation of the brown-colored sulfur bacterium Chlorobium phaeobacteroides.Photochem. Photobiol. 2004; 79 (15115301): 280-28510.1562/WB-03-11.1Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but we have demonstrated that this strain contains at least two active CruI carotenoid reductases. C. parvum, C. thalassium (Chloroherpetonaceae), and P. aestuarii are green-colored GSB and, like C. tepidum, synthesize monocyclic carotenoids with chlorobactene or γ-carotene backbones (39Gibson J. Pfennig N. Waterbury J.B. Chloroherpeton thalassium gen. nov. et spec. nov., a non-filamentous, flexing and gliding green sulfur bacterium.Arch.

Res. 2000; 64 (16228441): 27-3910.1023/A:1026515027824Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but the CruI proteins from these strains may have lost function during their evolution. Alternatively, the substrate provided to these proteins may be unsuitable to determine their activities as carotenoid reductases; they may have stricter substrate specificities and only reduce carotenoids with chlorobactene or γ-carotene backbones. It is also possible that the proteins encoded by these genes have alternative functions, e.g. biosynthesis of other isoprenoid molecules or the reduction/desaturation of fatty acids. The role of the CruI proteins for which an activity has not been demonstrated will require further study, including heterologous expression in the cruI mutant of C. tepidum, which may produce more suitable substrates for these orthologs. This will require the development of a plasmid-based expression system or the identification of a neutral site in the genome in which a foreign gene and a promoter sequence can be inserted. The absence of a cruI gene in B. viridis, which synthesizes 1,2-dihydro-derivatives of neurosporene and lycopene, suggests that an additional carotenoid 1,2-reductase exists in nature, and it must be structurally unrelated to those found in GSB. This independent evolution of unrelated enzymes catalyzing the same reaction is not uncommon in nature (41Galperin M.Y. Walker D.R. Koonin E.V. Analogous enzymes: independent inventions in enzyme evolution.Genome Res. 1998; 8 (9724324): 779-79010.1101/g"

How does a speaker’s ability to keep commitments affect children’s practical decisions to trust and their epistemic decisions to learn? An amassing body of research documents children’s trust in testimonial learning decisions, which can be moved in the face of epistemic and moral evidence about an agent. However, other bases for trust go largely unexplored in this literature, such as interpersonal reasons to trust. Here, we investigated how direct bids for interpersonal trust in the form of making commitments, or obligations to the listener, influence a range of decisions toward that agent. We found that 3- and 4-year-olds’ (N = 75) practical decisions to wait and to share were moved as a function of a person’s commitment-keeping ability, but epistemic decisions to learn were not. Keeping one’s commitments may provide children with interpersonal reasons to trust, reasons that may function in ways distinct from the considerations that bear on accepting a claim."

Based on this, the present study investigated the use of CVRS for predicting dementia and elucidated its association with cognitive change in patients with MCI over a three-year follow-up. Methods We included 340 patients with MCI with more than one follow-up visit. Data were obtained from the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. We assessed all the patients using CVRS and determined their progression to dementia during a follow-up period of over 3 years. The cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze hazard ratios (HRs) of CVRS for disease progression. Further, multiple cognitive measures of the patients over time were fitted using the random effect model to assess the effect of initial CVRS score on subsequent cognitive changes. Results Of 340 patients, 69 (20.2%) progressed to dementia and the median baseline score (interquartile range) of CVRS significantly differed between stable MCI and progressive MCI (9 (5–13) vs 13 (8–17), p<0.001). The initial CVRS score was independently associated with an increased risk of progression to dementia (HR 1.123, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.059–1.192). From 12 to 24 months, the effect of the interaction between CVRS and interval of follow-up visit on cognitive performance achieved significance (p<0.001). Conclusions Baseline CVRS predicted the progression to dementia in patients with MCI, and was independently associated with longitudinal cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W2888074354,"Mammalian oocytes and zygotes have nucleoli that are transcriptionally inactive and structurally distinct from nucleoli in somatic cells. These nucleoli have been termed nucleolus precursor bodies (NPBs). Recent research has shown that NPBs are important for embryonic development, but they are only required during pronuclear formation. After fertilization, multiple small NPBs are transiently formed in male and female pronuclei and then fuse into a single large NPB in zygotes. In cloned embryos produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), multiple NPBs are formed and maintained in the pseudo-pronucleus, and this is considered an abnormality of the cloned embryos. Despite this difference between SCNT and normal embryos, it is unclear how the size and number of NPBs in pronuclei is determined. Here, we show that in mouse embryos, the volume of NPB materials plays a major role in the NPB scaling through a limiting component mechanism and determines whether a single or multiple NPBs will form in the pronucleus. Extra NPB- and extra MII spindle-injection experiments demonstrated that the total volume of NPBs was maintained regardless of the pronucleus number and the ratio of pronucleus/NPB is important for fusion into a single NPB. Based on these results, we examined whether extra-NPB injection rescued multiple NPB maintenance in SCNT embryos. When extra-NPBs were injected into enucleated-MII oocytes before SCNT, the number of NPBs in pseudo-pronuclei of SCNT embryos was reduced. These results indicate that multiple NPB maintenance in SCNT embryos is caused by insufficient volume of NPB."

Methods This study was conducted at the Department of Sexually Transmitted Infections Control Clinic in Singapore using clinical data from 2010 to 2016. Explanatory sequential mixed method design was adopted. Predictors of LTFU and nPEP adherence were assessed using modified Poisson regression with robust sandwich variance. Subsequently, nine in-depth interviews with healthcare providers were conducted to gain their insights into barriers and facilitators to nPEP implementation. Transcripts were coded and themes were explored using applied thematic analysis. Results Of 502 nPEP cases reviewed, 46% were LTFU, 42% were adherent to nPEP and 431 prescription decisions were made in accordance with the guideline. Tourists (aRR, 2.29 [1.90–2.74]; p<0.001) and men who have sex with men/bisexual men (aRR, 1.32 [1.09–1.59]; p = 0.004) were significant predictors of LTFU. Absence of side effects (aRR, 1.14 [1.02–1.27]; p = 0.024) and nPEP treatment with TDF/FTC/ATV/r (aRR, 1.15 [1.03–1.29]; p = 0.017) were positively associated with nPEP adherence. Stigma, types of antiretroviral regimen, side effects, and patients’ perception of risk and treatment benefits derived qualitatively further reinforced corresponding quantitative findings. Conclusion Tailored socio-behavioral interventions are needed to address inherent differences within heterogeneous populations requesting nPEP, stigma, and patients’ perceptions of nPEP in order to improve follow-up and its adherence."

Driven by rapid industrialization, urban spatial structures are undergoing evolution and change. Therefore, this paper analyzes the processes and mechanisms associated with the evolution of the commercial spatial structure in Guangzhou after the financial crisis in 2008 based on both theoretical and empirical analyses. We use a Dirichlet multinomial regression (DMR) model to extract latent semantic information and determine urban functional areas from global positioning system (GPS) and point-of-interest (POI) data collected in Guangzhou in 2009 and 2013. In addition, we use movement patterns and POI data to identify the evolution of Guangzhou's commercial zones from 2009 to 2013. The results show that the urban commercial structure in Guangzhou gradually changed from a single-center model to a multi-center model with dispersed clusters and that the distribution of the entire spatial structure changed. Meanwhile, Guangzhou’s commercial structure not only varied over time but also exhibited specific geographical features. This paper demonstrates that the proposed method can clearly identify the boundary of the commercial area in Guangzhou and provides a valid spatial-temporal model of change in the city. Moreover, this study not only expounds the future development trends of the urban spatial structure in Guangzhou from a microcosmic perspective but also provides a scientific basis for clarifying the spatial locations and development advantages of urban functions within the city."
https://openalex.org/W2888382397,"Maintaining goal representations is a critical component of cognitive control and is required for successful performance in many daily activities. This is particularly important when goal-relevant information needs to be maintained in working memory (WM), updated in response to changing task demands or internal goal states, and protected from interference by inhibiting counter-goal behaviors. Modulation of fronto-striatal dopamine is critical for updating and maintaining goals and representations. Here we test the hypothesis that a genetic predisposition (C957T T+ and DRD2/ANKK1-TaqIA A+) for reduced striatal D2 receptor availability would facilitate goal maintenance using the AX-continuous performance task (AX-CPT), on a sample of 196 adults (25-67 y). We demonstrate that carriers of two polymorphisms that have been linked to reduced striatal D2 receptor density show increased performance on context-dependent (BX) trials, and that the effect of these polymorphisms was only significant for long ISI trials where the demand for goal maintenance is high. The current results add further knowledge to the role of D2 receptor functioning in cognitive stability and flexibility, and could have implications for understanding cognitive deficits in patients characterized by altered dopamine functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2888162369,"Selecting amino acids to design novel protein-protein interactions that facilitate catalysis is a daunting challenge. We propose that a computational coevolutionary landscape based on sequence analysis alone offers a major advantage over expensive, time-consuming brute-force approaches currently employed. Our coevolutionary landscape allows prediction of single amino acid substitutions that produce functional interactions between non-cognate, interspecies signaling partners. In addition, it can also predict mutations that maintain segregation of signaling pathways across species. Specifically, predictions of phosphotransfer activity between the Escherichia coli histidine kinase EnvZ to the non-cognate receiver Spo0F from Bacillus subtilis were compiled. Twelve mutations designed to enhance, suppress, or have a neutral effect on kinase phosphotransfer activity to a non-cognate partner were selected. We experimentally tested the ability of the kinase to relay phosphate to the respective designed Spo0F receiver proteins against the theoretical predictions. Our key finding is that the coevolutionary landscape theory, with limited structural data, can significantly reduce the search-space for successful prediction of single amino acid substitutions that modulate phosphotransfer between the two-component His-Asp relay partners in a predicted fashion. This combined approach offers significant improvements over large-scale mutations studies currently used for protein engineering and design."

Flying tympanate moths take various evasive actions when they detect bat cries, including turning away, performing a steering/zigzagging flight and ceasing flight. In general, infrequent ultrasonic pulses with low sound intensities that are emitted by distant bats evoke slight turns, whereas frequent and loud ultrasonic pulses of nearby bats evoke erratic or rapid unpredictable changes in the flight path of a moth. Flight cessation, which is a freezing response that causes the moth to passively dive (drop) to the ground, is considered the ultimate last-ditch evasive behaviour against approaching bats where there is a high predation threat. Here, we found that the crambid moth Nomophila nearctica never performed passive dives in response to frequent and loud ultrasonic pulses of >60 dB sound pressure level (SPL) that simulated the attacking echolocation call sequence of the predominant sympatric insectivorous bat Eptesicus fuscus, but rather turned away or flew erratically, regardless of the temporal structure of the stimulus. Consequently, N. nearctica is likely to survive predation by bats by taking early evasive action even when it detects the echolocation calls of sympatric bats hunting other insects at a distance. Since aerially hawking bats can track and catch erratically flying moths after targeting their prey, this early escape strategy may be common among night-flying tympanate insects."
https://openalex.org/W2888550301,"The retinal location of visual information changes each time we move our eyes. Although it is now known that visual information is remapped in retinotopic coordinates across eye-movements (saccades), it is currently unclear how head-centered auditory information is remapped across saccades. Keeping track of the location of a sound source in retinotopic coordinates requires a rapid multi-modal reference frame transformation when making saccades. To reveal this reference frame transformation, we designed an experiment where participants attended an auditory or visual cue and executed a saccade. After the saccade had landed, an auditory or visual target could be presented either at the prior retinotopic location or at an uncued location. We observed that both auditory and visual targets presented at prior retinotopic locations were reacted to faster than targets at other locations. In a second experiment, we observed that spatial attention pointers obtained via audition are available in retinotopic coordinates immediately after an eye-movement is made. In a third experiment, we found evidence for an asymmetric cross-modal facilitation of information that is presented at the retinotopic location. In line with prior single cell recording studies, this study provides the first behavioral evidence for immediate auditory and cross-modal transsaccadic updating of spatial attention. These results indicate that our brain has efficient solutions for solving the challenges in localizing sensory input that arise in a dynamic context."
https://openalex.org/W2888742082,"The evidence that gene mutations in the polarity determinant Crumbs homologs-2 (CRB2) cause congenital nephrotic syndrome suggests the functional importance of this gene product in podocyte development. Because another isoform, CRB3, was reported to repress the mechanistic/mammalian target of the rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, we examined the role of CRB2 function in developing podocytes in relation to mTORC1. In HEK-293 and MDCK cells constitutively expressing CRB2, we found that the protein localized to the apicolateral side of the cell plasma membrane and that this plasma membrane assembly required N-glycosylation. Confocal microscopy of the neonate mouse kidney revealed that both the tyrosine-phosphorylated form and non-phosphorylated form of CRB2 commence at the S-shaped body stage at the apicolateral side of podocyte precursor cells and move to foot processes in a capillary tuft pattern. The pattern of phosphorylated mTOR in developing podocytes was similar to that of CRB2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Additionally, the lack of a tyrosine phosphorylation site on CRB2 led to the reduced sensitivity of mTORC1 activation in response to energy starvation. CRB2 may play an important role in the mechanistic pathway of developing podocytes through tyrosine phosphorylation by associating with mTORC1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2888036063,"Planktonic archaea are thought to play an important role in ammonia oxidation in marine environments. Data on the distribution, abundance, and diversity of ammonia oxidizers in the coastal sea-surface microlayer (SML) are lacking, despite previous reports of high abundance of Thaumarchaeota in the SML of estuaries and freshwater lakes. Here, we failed to detect the presence of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in any of our samples taken from a semi-enclosed marine inlet in Japan. Therefore, we shifted our focus to examine the archaeal community composition as well as the Thaumarchaeota marine group I (MG-I) and ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) gene copy numbers and composition in the SML and corresponding underlying water (UW, 20 cm). amoA gene copy numbers obtained by quantitative PCR were consistent with the typical values observed in the surface waters of oceanic and coastal environments where nitrification activity has been detected, but the copy numbers were two- to three-fold less than those reported from the surface layers and UW of high mountain lakes. Both amoA and MG-I 16S rRNA gene copy numbers were significantly negatively correlated with chlorophyll-a and transparent exopolymer particle concentrations in the SML. Communities of archaea and ammonia-oxidizing archaea in SML samples collected during low wind conditions (≤5 m s-1) differed the most from those in UW samples, whereas the communities in SML samples collected during high wind conditions were similar to the UW communities. In the SML, low ratios of amoA to MG-I 16S rRNA genes were observed, implying that most of the SML Thaumarchaeota lacked amoA. To our knowledge, our results provide the first comparison of ammonia-oxidizing communities in the coastal SML with those in the UW."
https://openalex.org/W2888465734,"Previously, fluorodeoxy glucose conjugated magnetite nanoparticles (FDG-mNPs) injected into cancer cells in conjunction with the application of magnetic hyperthermia have shown promise in new FDG-mNPs applications. The aim of this study was to determine potential toxic or unwanted effects involving both tumour cells and normal tissue in other organs when FDG-mNPs are administered intravenously or intratumourally in mice.FDG-mNPs were synthesized. A group of six prostate-tumour bearing mice were injected with 23.42 mg/ml FDG-mNPs (intravenous injection, n = 3; intratumoural injection into the prostate tumour, n = 3). Mice were euthanized and histological sampling of tissue was conducted for the prostate tumour, as well as for lungs, lymph nodes, liver, kidneys, spleen, and brain, at 1 hour (n = 2) and 7 days (n = 4) post-injection. A second group of two normal (non-cancerous) mice received the same injection intravenously into the tail vein and were euthanised at 3 and 6 months post-injection, respectively, to investigate if FDG-mNPs remained in organs at those time points.In prostate-tumour bearing mice, FDG-mNPs concentrated in the prostate tumour, while relatively small amounts were found in the organs of other tissues, particularly the spleen and the liver; FDG-mNP concentrations decreased over time in all tissues. In normal mice, no detrimental effects were found in either mouse at 3 or 6 months.Intravenous or intratumoural FDG-mNPs can be safely administered for effective cancer cell destruction. Further research on the clinical utility of FDG-mNPs will be conducted by applying hyperthermia in conjunction with FDG-mNPs in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2888011843,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) is a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis and a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is defined as isolation of Sp from a normally sterile site, including blood or cerebrospinal fluid. The aim of this study is to describe outcomes as well as clinical and epidemiological characteristics of hospitalized IPD case patients in central China.We conducted surveillance for IPD among children and adults from April 5, 2010 to September 30, 2012, in four major hospitals in Jingzhou City, Hubei Province. We collected demographic, clinical, and outcome data for all enrolled hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) or meningitis, and collected blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for laboratory testing for Sp infections. Collected data were entered into Epidata software and imported into SPSS for analysis.We enrolled 22,375 patients, including 22,202 (99%) with SARI and 173 (1%) with meningitis. One hundred and eighteen (118, 3%) with either SARI or meningitis were Sp positive, 32 (0.8%) from blood/CSF culture, and 87 (5%) from urine antigen testing. Of those 118 patients, 57% were aged ≥65 years and nearly 100% received antibiotics during hospitalization. None were previously vaccinated with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 7), 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, or seasonal influenza vaccine. The main serotypes identified were 14, 12, 3, 1, 19F, 4, 5, 9V, 15 and 18C, corresponding to serotype coverage rates of 42%, 63%, and 77% for PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13, respectively.Further work is needed to expand access to pneumococcal vaccination in China, both among children and potentially among the elderly, and inappropriate use of antibiotics is a widespread and serious problem in China."
https://openalex.org/W2888736461,"Although studies have examined the effect of emotional stimuli on reality-monitoring source memory, it is poorly understood whether the effect observed would remain if emotion is induced after encoding. In addition, although there has been evidence that post-encoding emotion enhances item memory but not external monitoring source memory, it is unclear whether such a null effect extends to other types of source memory. To address these gaps, in the current study, participants encoded a list of words. For half of the words they were asked to think about the corresponding opposite words, and for the remaining half of words they viewed the corresponding opposite words. Following encoding they watched a neutral, positive or negative video. Replicating prior studies, both positive and negative emotions enhanced consolidation of item memory. Furthermore, participants at a high level of state anxiety, trait anxiety and depression were more likely to benefit from the enhancement effect of post-encoding emotion. However, no significant effect was observed on reality-monitoring source memory. Taken together the current study suggests that the enhancement effect of post-encoding emotion on item memory does not necessarily extend to reality-monitoring source memory."
https://openalex.org/W2888325856,"Despite advances in pharmacotherapy, heart failure still incurs significant morbidity and mortality. Stimulating antibodies directed against the secondextracellular loop of the human ß1-adrenergic receptor (anti-ß1EC2) cause myocyte damage and heart failure in rats. This receptor domain is 100% homologous between rats and humans.ß1EC2-mimicking cyclopeptides (25-meric) markedly improved the development and/or course of anti-ß1EC2-mediated cardiomyopathy. Further developments should be investigated.The shortened 18-meric cyclic peptide COR-1, in which one of the two disulphide bonds was removed to enable reproducible GMP production, can also be used to treat cardiomyopathic rats. Echocardiography, catheterization and histopathology of the rat hearts revealed that monthly intravenous administrations of COR-1 almost fully reversed the cardiomyopathic phenotype within 6 months at doses of 1 to 4 mg/kg body weight. Administration of COR-1 resulted in markedly reduced anti-ß1EC2-expressing memory B lymphocytes in the spleen despite continued antigenic boosts, but did not significantly decrease overall peripheral anti-ß1EC2 titers. COR-1 did not induce any anti-ß1EC2 or other immune response in naïve rats (corresponding to findings in healthy human volunteers). It did not cause any toxic side effects in GLP studies in dogs, rats or mice, and the ""no observed adverse effect level"" (NOAEL) exceeded the therapeutic doses by 100-fold.The second generation immunomodulating epitope-mimicking cyclopeptide COR-1 (also termed JNJ-5442840) offers promise to treat immune-mediated cardiac diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2623509783,"Climate change will affect stream systems in numerous ways over the coming century. Globally, streams are expected to experience changes in temperature and flow regime. Previous work has indicated that these changes will likely affect fish distributions, but little work has been conducted examining population level effects of climate change on warmwater fish at the warmest portion of their range. We model several potential climate change-related stressors and the resulting effects on smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu populations in the Buffalo National River, Arkansas, USA, located near the southern extent of smallmouth bass range. Smallmouth bass are a popular recreational fish in the region and angler harvest likely contributes substantially to annual mortality. We created a simulation model parameterized with data collected from the Buffalo National River to evaluate the relative importance of climate stressors and angler harvest on smallmouth bass populations. Our simulations suggest that increases in springtime temperature and reductions in river discharge during the spawning period could increase recruitment, resulting in increases in adult abundance (8% higher). However, when increased flooding and drought probabilities are considered, our model indicates the Buffalo National River could experience large reductions in adult smallmouth bass abundance (≥50% decline) and increased probability of extinction compared to present levels. Simulations showed that harvest reduction could be a viable strategy to reduce the negative effects of climate change, but that even with complete closure of harvest, smallmouth bass population levels would still be well below present abundance (46% lower than present). Efforts to reduce flooding and drought effects related to climate change in the Buffalo National River could help offset the predicted reduction in the smallmouth bass population."
https://openalex.org/W2888193398,"When people in laboratory studies sample products in a sequence, they tend to prefer options presented first and last. To what extent do these primacy and recency effects carry over to real-world settings where numerous sources of information determine preferences? To investigate this question, we coded archival data from 136 actual whisky tastings each featuring seven whiskies. We analyzed people’s ratings of whiskies featured at different serial positions in the tastings. We found a recency effect: people gave their highest rating to whiskies in the last position, and voted the last whisky as their favorite more frequently. This recency effect persisted when we controlled for the counter explanation that whiskies with higher alcohol content tended to occupy later serial positions. The recency effect also persisted when we controlled for the age of the whiskies. Taken together, our findings suggest that the order of presentation matters in real-world settings, closely resembling what happens in laboratory settings with longer sequences of options."
https://openalex.org/W2888638203,"We examined the changes in thyroid hormone levels in patients with an acute clinical condition and compared these to levels in the healthy subjects. Serum total triiodothyronine (T3), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and free thyroxine (fT4) measurements were recorded from 555 patients (mean age: 55.0 years, men: 65.9%) admitted to the emergency department (ED) 1-91 months (median: 34 months) after a regular health examination (HE). Serological data were analyzed; mean change in hormone levels was stratified by emergency classification system and quintiles of changes in inflammatory marker values, such as neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP). The mean decrease in T3 levels from HE and ED samples was 10.6 ng/dL (p< 0.001). Mean decrease in T3 levels was 21.6 ng/dL among patients classified as having an infection status and 11.0 ng/dL among patients classified as having an urgency status. A decrease 3.7 ng/dL among emergency patients was observed. TSH and fT4 levels did not change across all groups. When patients were stratified into quintiles according to changes in NLR values, mean decreases in T3 were 6.21, 8.14, 14.37, 12.76, and 21.98 ng/dL and showed significant linear reduction (p<0.001). For quintiles of changed CRP values, mean decreased T3 levels were 10.57, 3.05, 4.47, 7.68, and 28.07 ng/dL. TSH and fT4 were not associated with significant changes (p = 0.100, p = 0.561, respectively). In this study, thyroid function changes in individuals with an acute condition revealed that T3 significantly decreased, more markedly in infectious diseases compared to their healthy counterparts, and decline in T3 measurements correlated with inflammatory markers. TSH and fT4 levels remained stable. It is necessary to consider the severity of acute conditions when abnormal T3 levels are detected in subjects with emergent status."
