https://openalex.org/W2121815042,"Systematic studies on the significance of the secretory-like morphological characteristic of cardiac atrial muscle cells of mammals led to the finding that these cells produce a polypeptide hormone. This hormone, described in 1981 as atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), is diuretic (natriuretic), hypotensive, and has an inhibitory effect on renin and aldosterone secretion. Thus, ANF probably intervenes in the short- and long-term control of water and electrolyte balance and of blood pressure. Phylogenetically, ANF appears early, suggesting different functions for this peptide in accordance with each species' environment. Knowledge of the properties of the hormone should provide insights into the pathophysiology of important clinical entities and lead to the development of new pharmaceutical products."

https://openalex.org/W2058443192,"Early region E3 of adenovirus-2 encodes a glycoprotein, E19, that associates with class I MHC antigens. The interaction occurs concomitantly with abrogated terminal glycosylation of class I antigen heavy chains, as shown by pulse-chase and Endo H digestion experiments. Also the viral protein remains in the high mannose form throughout the chase period. These results do not reflect a general impairment of terminal glycosylation of membrane proteins. Immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated that in virally infected cells E19 and class I antigens accumulate in the perinuclear region. Class I antigens gradually disappear from the cell surface. A diminished cell surface expression of class I antigens may be a means by which adenoviruses evade immune surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W1990823895,"A component present in splicing extracts selectively binds the 3' splice site of a precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) transcript of a human beta-globin gene. Since this component can be immunoprecipitated by either autoantibodies of the Sm class or antibodies specifically directed against trimethylguanosine, it is a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP). Its interaction with the 3' splice site occurs rapidly even at 0 degrees C, does not require adenosine triphosphate, and is altered by certain mutations in the 3' splice site region. Binding is surprisingly insensitive to treatment of the extract with micrococcal nuclease. The U5 particle is the only abundant Sm snRNP with a capped 5' end that is equally resistant to micrococcal nuclease. This suggests that, in addition to the U1 and U2 snRNP's, U5 snRNP's participate in pre-mRNA splicing."

https://openalex.org/W2023538182,"An immunoreactive form of the anion channel protein of erythrocytes, band 3, has been identified in the rat kidney. It is found in the intercalated cells of the distal tubule and collecting ducts. Immunostaining specific for band 3 is confined to the basolateral plasma membrane of these cells, where this protein probably mediates the transport of bicarbonate across the tubular wall. Double-immunolabeling studies demonstrate that band 3 is colocalized with immunoreactive forms of ankyrin and spectrin along the basolateral plasma membrane. The polarized distribution of band 3 may be the result of the association of its cytoplasmic domain with ankyrin, which in turn links band 3 to spectrin and the cytoskeleton. These observations help to explain how the collecting ducts of the kidney can direct the transport of bicarbonate ions, thus maintaining the acid-base balance."
https://openalex.org/W1534508763,"We have purified a reduced and alkylated tryptic fragment of von Willebrand factor (vWF) which migrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a 52/48-kDa doublet, but behaved as a single 46-kDa species after partial deglycosylation. After extensive treatment with denaturants, the 52/48-kDa polypeptide retained its ability to inhibit ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation in the presence of native vWF, as well as aggregation induced by desialylated vWF alone. Therefore, the 52/48-kDa polypeptide interacts with the platelet glycoprotein Ib receptor even in the absence of ristocetin. Both the 52/48- and the 46-kDa species inhibited ristocetin-induced binding of the intact molecule to platelets, but did not affect thrombin-induced binding. Determination of the NH2-terminal sequence of both members of the doublet gave identical results: VTLNPSDPEHCQ. This provided additional evidence that differences between the doublet constituents were only of carbohydrate composition and established the position of this peptide within the vWF polypeptide chain of approximately 2050 amino acid residues as beginning with the residue tentatively designated 449. These studies suggest that native conformation is not necessary for binding of vWF to platelets at the glycoprotein Ib receptor and that a linear amino acid sequence following residue 449 defines a domain responsible for this interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1576532370,"The variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) of Trypanosoma brucei are synthesized with a hydrophobic COOH-terminal peptide that is cleaved and replaced by a glycophospholipid, which anchors VSG to the surface membrane. The kinetics of VSG processing were studied by metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine and [3H]myristic acid. The COOH-terminal oligosaccharide-containing structure remaining after phospholipase removal of dimyristyl glycerol from membrane-form VSG could be detected serologically within 1 min of polypeptide synthesis in two T. brucei variants studied. Addition of the oligosaccharide-containing structure was resistant to tunicamycin. VSGs synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin displayed lower apparent molecular weights, consistent with the complete inhibition of N-glycosylation at one (variant 117), two (variant 221), or at least three (variant 118) internal asparagine sites. In most experiments, N-glycosylation appeared to occur during or immediately after polypeptide synthesis but in a few cases N-glycosylation was delayed or incomplete. In all cases, addition of the COOH-terminal oligosaccharide-containing structure occurred normally. In dual-labeling studies, cycloheximide caused rapid inhibition of both [35S]methionine and [3H]myristic acid incorporation, suggesting that myristic acid addition also occurs immediately after polypeptide synthesis. Our data suggest that the complex ethanolamine-glycosyl-dimyristylphosphatidylinositol structure of membrane-form VSG is added en bloc within 1 min of completion of the polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1542058436,"Interferon (IFN) treatment of human fibroblasts induces the transcription of two genes, IFN-IND-1 and -2, to a maximal level between 30 min and 2 h. Continued exposure to IFN results in a characterized by a return to pretreatment levels of transcription and the inability of further IFN treatment to reinduce the transcription of these genes. The imposition and the maintenance of desensitization apparently requires continuous protein synthesis because both can be reversed by cycloheximide. Thus a regulatory circuit of transcription for IFN-IND-1 and -2 includes a prompt IFN-induced transcriptional increase followed shortly by a negative regulatory response requiring a labile protein(s) that limits the duration of the increased transcriptional response."
https://openalex.org/W1524344741,"The influence of Ca2+ on the enzymatic and physical properties of smooth muscle myosin was studied. The actin-activated ATPase activity of phosphorylated gizzard myosin and heavy meromyosin is higher in the presence of Ca2+ than in its absence, but this effect is found only at lower MgCl2 concentrations. As the MgCl2 concentration is increased, Ca2+ sensitivity is decreased. The concentration of Ca2+ necessary to activate ATPase activity is higher than that required to saturate calmodulin. The similarity of the pCa dependence of ATPase activity and of Ca2+ binding to myosin and the competition by Mg2+ indicate that these effects involved the Ca2+-Mg2+ binding sites of gizzard myosin. For the actin dependence of ATPase activity of phosphorylated myosin at low concentrations of MgCl2, both Vmax and Ka are influenced by Ca2+. The formation of small polymers by phosphorylated myosin in the presence of Ca2+ could account for the alteration in the affinity for actin. For the actin dependence of phosphorylated heavy meromyosin at low MgCl2 concentrations, Ca2+ induces only an increase in Vmax. To detect alterations in physical properties, two techniques were used: viscosity and limited papain hydrolysis. For dephosphorylated myosin, 6 S or 10 S, Ca2+-dependent effects are not detected using either technique. However, for phosphorylated myosin the decrease in viscosity corresponding to the 6 S to 10 S transition is shifted to lower KCl concentrations by the presence of Ca2+. In addition, a Ca2+ dependence of proteolysis rates is observed with phosphorylated myosin but only at low ionic strength, i.e. under conditions where myosin assumes the folded conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1622931835,"We have examined the interaction of the purified cell-binding domain of fibronectin with fibroblastic baby hamster kidney cells. When the cell-binding region of fibronectin is part of a large 75,000-dalton fragment, the direct binding of the tritium-labeled fragment to cells in suspension can be observed. There is a single class of 10(5) sites/cell with an apparent dissociation constant of 4 X 10(-7) M. When the cell-binding region is part of a smaller 11,500-dalton fragment, an interaction with cells can only be observed indirectly via inhibition assays. The apparent affinity of this fragment for the cell surface fibronectin receptor is low. This 11,500-dalton fragment competitively inhibits both the direct binding of soluble [3H]fibronectin to cells in suspension and the spreading of cells on fibronectin-coated substrates, suggesting that the fragment binds to the same receptor site as intact fibronectin. Possible models describing the mechanism of the interaction of fibronectin with its receptor are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1560836239,"In addition to its important role in intracellular metabolic pathways, ATP appears to function as a neurotransmitter in mammalian neurones. The extracellular effects of ATP are not restricted to neurones. We describe the effects of ATP on transmembrane fluxes of monovalent and divalent cations and on phagocytosis in the J774 mouse macrophage cell line and in mouse macrophages elicited by intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate broth. Of all nucleotides tested, only ATP is capable of depolarizing the macrophage plasma membrane potential, promoting Na+ influx and K+ efflux, effecting an increase in intracellular free Ca2+, and inhibiting phagocytosis. Nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs had no effect on membrane permeability or phagocytosis. The effect mediated by ATP is not accompanied by an increase in membrane permeability to nucleotides, indicating that the action of ATP is restricted to the external surface of macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1529074024,"Abstract Phosphorylation of smooth muscle heavy meromyosin (HMM) has been shown to result in about a 25-fold increase in the steady-state Vmax of the actin-activated MgATPase activity from 0.07 s-1 for unphosphorylated HMM to 1.9 s-1 for phosphorylated HMM. The steady-state MgATPase activity of unphosphorylated HMM in the absence of actin is 0.004 s-1. The true extent of regulation might be even larger since the actin activation of the MgATPase activity of unphosphorylated HMM (from 0.004 to 0.07 s-1 at Vmax) could be arising from a small fraction of modified HMM molecules which are no longer regulated and that truly regulated unphosphorylated HMM molecules are not activated by actin. To test this idea, a limited turnover experiment was used to measure the reassociation rate of acto-unphosphorylated HMM following addition of a 2-4-fold molar excess of ATP. The reassociation rate was very slow and was not significantly increased by raising the actin concentration from 10 to 75 microM or by addition of trace phosphorylated HMM. The rate constant was estimated to be about 0.002 s-1, which is in good agreement with the rate of product (both Pi and ADP) release estimated from unphosphorylated HMM alone measured by a gel filtration technique. These two experiments suggest that the rate of product release from unphosphorylated HMM may not be significantly affected by actin and that perhaps the true extent of regulation of HMM by phosphorylation is much greater than that determined by steady-state methods. It also suggests that phosphorylation may operate by increasing the forward rate constant for product release by approximately 1000-fold."
https://openalex.org/W2007678783,"The simple relation between the substrates and products of site-specific recombination raises questions about the control of directionality often observed in this class of DNA transactions. For bacteriophage lambda, viral integration and excision proceed by discrete pathways, and DNA substrates with the intrinsic property of recombining in only one direction can be constructed. These pathways display an asymmetric reliance on a complex array of protein binding sites, and they respond differently to changes in the concentrations of the relevant proteins. The Escherichia coli protein integration host factor (IHF) differentially affects integrative and excisive recombination, thereby influencing directionality. A four- to eightfold increase in intracellular IHF coincides with the transition from exponential to stationary phase; this provides a mechanism for growth phase-dependent regulation of recombination that makes the cellular physiology an intrinsic part of the recombination reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1977462706,"Rat atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is translated as a 152-amino acid precursor preproANF. PreproANF is converted to the 126-amino acid proANF, the storage form of ANF in the atria. ANF isolated from the blood is approximately 25 amino acids long. It is demonstrated here that rat cardiocytes in culture store and secrete proANF. Incubation of proANF with serum produced a smaller ANF peptide. PreproANF seems to be processed to proANF in the atria, and proANF appears to be released into the blood, where it is converted by a protease to a smaller peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1513878203,"Both plant growth-promoting Pseudomonas B10 and its yellow-green, fluorescent iron transport agent (siderophore) pseudobactin enhance potato growth and biologically control certain soil-borne fungal diseases in part by depriving specific root-colonizing endemic microorganisms including phytopathogens of iron(III), thus inhibiting their growth. The present study examines this mode of iron deprivation. The growth inhibition of certain bean-deleterious fluorescent pseudomonads by specific bean-beneficial fluorescent pseudomonads is due in part to the inability of susceptible strains to utilize siderophores from beneficial strains to transport iron(III). Conversely, deleterious strains which were able to utilize siderophores from beneficial strains were not inhibited. The ability of a given pseudomonad to utilize another pseudomonad's siderophore may depend upon its possessing a specific outer membrane receptor protein for that pseudomonad's ferric siderophore. Siderophore-mediated competition for iron in microbial systems appears to be a widespread phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1620990221,"The 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.50) of rat brain cytosol has been purified to apparent homogeneity. The purification procedure involves six successive steps, includes one affinity chromatography, and yields enzyme which displays a 1,550-fold enhancement in specific activity. The homogeneous enzyme has a Km of 8.0 microM for 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, a Vmax of 1.3 mumol of 3 alpha-androstanediol formed per h/mg of protein, and displays a preference for NADPH. It appears to be the major activity responsible for the reduction of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone in this tissue and may play a pivotal role in brain androgen metabolism. The homogeneous enzyme has several properties in common with the 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase purified from rat liver cytosol (Penning, T. M., Mukharji, I., Barrows, S., and Talalay, P. (1984) Biochem. J. 222, 601-611). It is a monomer with a molecular weight of 31,000, it has a pI of 5.5, and it is potently inhibited by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (IC50 value for indomethacin = 2.0 microM). The potency of inhibition observed for the brain enzyme parallels that observed for cyclooxygenase: indomethacin greater than fenamates greater than l-methylpyrrole acetic acids greater than arylpropionic acids greater than salicylates greater than acetaminophen. Examination of a variety of steroidal contraceptives as modulators of the dehydrogenase indicates that ethinylestradiol is a very poor inhibitor (IC50 = 100 microM), while 6-medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) is an extremely potent inhibitor (IC50 = 0.2 microM). The possibility exists that brain androgen metabolism may be altered by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and synthetic progestins."
https://openalex.org/W1524239101,"The effects of phosphorylation on the interaction between spectrin and ankyrin were investigated. Spectrin and ankyrin were phosphorylated using purified human erythrocyte membrane and cytosolic (casein kinase A) kinases. These two kinases have similar properties as well as activities toward spectrin and ankyrin. Both kinases catalyzed the incorporation of about 2 mol of phosphate/mol of spectrin and about 7 mol of phosphate/mol of ankyrin. These phosphates were incorporated primarily into seryl and threonyl residues of the proteins. The phosphopeptide maps of ankyrin phosphorylated by the membrane kinase and casein kinase A were identical. Binding studies indicate that ankyrin exhibits different affinities for spectrin dimers (KD = 2.5 +/- 0.9 X 10(-6) M) and tetramers (KD = 2.7 +/- 0.8 X 10(-7) M). These dissociation constants were not appreciably affected by the phosphorylation of spectrin. On the other hand, phosphorylation of ankyrin was found to significantly reduce its affinity for either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated spectrin tetramers (KD = 1.2 +/- 0.1 X 10(-6) M) but not spectrin dimers (KD = 2.5 +/- 0.4 X 10(-6) M). The same results were obtained using either the membrane kinase or casein kinase A as the phosphorylating enzyme. The above observation suggests that ankyrin phosphorylation may provide an important mechanism for the regulation of the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeletal network."
https://openalex.org/W2122798188,"We have treated bovine lung heparan sulfate with alkaline [3H]borohydride to end label the chains with [3H]xylitol. After subsequent periodate oxidation-alkaline elimination products were separated by gel permeation and ion exchange chromatography. The linkage region fragment expected to have 2 galactoses and 1 [3H]xylitol residue appeared in the tetra-/trisaccharide region after gel filtration and was bound to the anion exchange resin. A similar negatively charged fragment, expected to have 2 galactoses, 1 xylose and 1 serine, was isolated after periodate oxidation-alkaline elimination of unlabeled heparan sulfate. The negative charge was due to the presence of alkaline phosphatase-labile phosphate ester. The molar ratio of galactose:phosphate:xylose was 2.17:1.19:1.00. The phosphate ester was associated with the xylose/[3H] xylitol moiety as indicated by the formation of phosphoxylose/-xylitol by beta-galactosidase digestion of the phosphorylated trisaccharide. Furthermore, orcinol reactivity disappeared after periodate oxidation of the dephosphorylated trisaccharide. The phosphate ester must be located to C-2 of xylose/xylitol as the 1-3H radioactivity could be released by periodate oxidation when it was preceded by alkaline phosphatase treatment. It is estimated that almost every chain of heparan sulfate carries 2-phosphoxylose. It would be of interest to know if glycosaminoglycan chains that are artificially initiated onto exogeneous beta-D-xylosides also acquire the 2-phosphoxylose moiety."
https://openalex.org/W1556780020,"Previous studies have demonstrated that protein S is required for optimal activated protein C-mediated inactivation of Factor Va on the surface of either the platelet or phospholipid vesicles. In this report we demonstrate assembly of the activated protein C-protein S complex on the surface of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. Endothelial cell surface acceleration of Factor Va inactivation by activated protein C required the presence of protein S. Kinetic studies indicated that the rate of Factor Va inactivation was half-maximal at a protein S concentration of 0.2 nM and an activated protein C concentration of 0.05 nM. Binding of 125I-activated protein C to endothelial cell monolayers was absolutely dependent on the presence of protein S. At saturating levels of protein S, activated protein C binding was saturable with Kd = 0.04 nM. In contrast, specific, time-dependent, and saturable binding of 125I-protein S to endothelium occurred in the absence of activated protein C. Addition of activated protein C increased the affinity of protein S from Kd = 11 nM to 0.2 nM, but did not change the number of molecules bound per cell at saturation (85,000 molecules/cell). These studies suggest that activated protein C increases the affinity of protein S for pre-existing sites on the endothelial cell surface. The close correlation between the parameters of protein S-activated protein C binding to endothelium and Factor Va inactivation supports the concept that it is bound protein S and activated protein C that are the active species. Formation of functional activated protein C-protein S complexes thus occurs effectively on the endothelial cell surface and represents a new addition to the list of vessel wall anticoagulant properties."
https://openalex.org/W1592048518,"Submitochondrial particles from beef heart, washed with dilute solutions of KCl so as to activate the latent, membrane-bound ATPase, F1, may be used to study single site catalysis by the enzyme. [gamma-32P]ATP, incubated with a molar excess of catalytic sites, a condition which favors binding of substrate in only a single catalytic site on the enzyme, is hydrolyzed via a four-step reaction mechanism. The mechanism includes binding in a high affinity catalytic site, Ka = 10(12)M-1, a hydrolytic step for which the equilibrium constant is near unity, and two product release steps in which Pi dissociates from catalytic sites about 10 times more rapidly than ADP. Catalysis by the membrane-bound ATPase also is characterized by a 10(6)-fold acceleration in the rate of net hydrolysis of [gamma-32P]ATP, bound in the high affinity catalytic site, that occurs when substrate is made available to additional catalytic sites on the enzyme. These aspects of the reaction mechanism of the ATPase of submitochondrial particles closely parallel the reaction mechanism determined for solubilized, homogeneous F1 (Grubmeyer, C., Cross, R. L., and Penefsky, H. S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12092-12100). The finding that removal of the enzyme from the membrane does not significantly alter the properties of single site catalysis lends support to models of ATP synthesis in oxidative phosphorylation, catalyzed by membrane-bound F1, that have been based on the study of the soluble enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1570420525,"Luminescence energy transfer measurements have been used to determine the distances between the two high affinity Ca2+ binding-transport sites of the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. The lanthanide Tb3+ situated at one high affinity Ca2+ site was used as the transfer donor, and acceptors at the other Ca2+ site were the lanthanides Nd3+, Pr3+, Ho3+, or Er3+. Terbium bound to the enzyme was excited directly with a pulsed dye laser. Analysis of the changes in the terbium luminescence lifetime due to the presence of the acceptor indicates that the distance between the Ca2+ sites is 10.7 A. The distance between the Ca2+ sites and the nucleotide-binding catalytic site was determined using Tb3+ at the Ca2+ sites and either trinitrophenyl nucleotides (TNP-N) or fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC) in the catalytic site as energy acceptors. The R0 values for the Tb-acceptor pairs are approximately 30 and approximately 40 A for TNP-N and FITC, respectively. The distance between Tb3+ at the Ca2+ sites and TNP-ATP at the nucleotide site is approximately 35 A and that between the Ca2+ sites and the FITC labeling site is approximately 47 A. Considerations of the molecular dimensions of the ATPase polypeptide indicate that while the two Ca2+ sites are close to each other, the Ca2+ sites and the nucleotide site are quite remote in the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1511441978,"The effects of extracellular Na+ (Na+o) on cytosolic ionized calcium (Ca2+i) and on calcium and sodium fluxes were measured in monkey kidney cells (LLC-MK2). Ca2+i was measured with aequorin and the ion fluxes with 45Ca and 22Na. Na+-free media rapidly increased Ca2+i from 60 to a maximum of about 700 nM in 2-3 min. After the peak, Ca2+i declined and reached a plateau of about twice the resting Ca2+i. The peak Ca2+i was inversely proportional to Na+o and directly proportional to the extracellular calcium concentration (Ca2+o). On the other hand, a pH of 6.8 reduced and Ca2+o substitution with Sr2+ completely blocked the Ca2+i response to low Na+o. A Na+-free medium stimulated calcium efflux from the cells 4-5-fold, a response which was abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Na+-free media also stimulated calcium influx and sodium efflux. The cell calcium content, however, was not increased. These results indicate that removal of extracellular Na+ increases Ca2+i by stimulating calcium influx and not by inhibiting calcium efflux; the increased calcium influx takes place on the Na+-Ca2+ antiporter operating in the reverse mode in exchange for sodium efflux. The increased calcium efflux occurs as a consequence of the rise in Ca2+i and presumably takes place on the (Ca2+-Mg2+) ATPase-dependent calcium pump."
https://openalex.org/W1632633932,"Gizzard heavy meromyosin (HMM) sediments in the ultracentrifuge as a single peak, whose sedimentation coefficient (S20,w) decreases from 9 to 7.5 S upon increasing the NaCl concentration from 0.02 to 0.3 M. This decrease is accompanied by a parallel increase in Mg2+-ATPase activity, suggesting that both changes have a common molecular basis. Phosphorylation decreases S20,w and increases ATPase activity, while ATP increases S20,w. Sedimentation equilibrium studies indicate that HMM undergoes no detectable aggregation at 0.02 or 0.4 M NaCl, remaining monomeric with a molecular weight of 3.4 X 10(5). In contrast, S20,w of subfragment 1 does not change with changes in ionic strength, and its ATPase activity does not decrease at low ionic strengths. Electron micrographs of samples of HMM prepared at low ionic strength show that up to half of the molecules are flexed, i.e. the heads are bent at the neck and project back toward the tail, while the remaining molecules have either one or both of the heads pointing away from the tail. In samples prepared at high ionic strength only about 10% of the molecules are flexed. There is a linear relationship between the fraction of flexed molecules and S20,w, with no significant bending or folding of the tail and no detectable change in the shape of the heads. This correlation suggests that the changes in ATPase activity and S20,w may be a result of the reorientation of the heads."
https://openalex.org/W1996840237,"Incubation of [gamma-32P]ATP with a molar excess of the membrane-bound form of mitochondrial ATPase (F1) results in binding of the bulk of the radioactive nucleotide in high affinity catalytic sites (Ka = 10(12) M-1). Subsequent initiation of respiration by addition of succinate or NADH is accompanied by a profound decrease in the affinity for ATP. About one-third of the bound radioactive ATP appears to dissociate, that is, the [gamma-32P]ATP becomes accessible to hexokinase. The NADH-stimulated dissociation of [gamma-32P]ATP is energy-dependent since the stimulation is inhibited by uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and is prevented by respiratory chain inhibitors. The rate of the energy-dependent dissociation of ATP that occurs in the presence of NADH, ADP, and Pi is commensurate with the measured initial rate of ATP synthesis in NADH-supported oxidative phosphorylation catalyzed by the same submitochondrial particles. Thus, the rate of dissociation of ATP from the high affinity catalytic site of submitochondrial particles meets the criterion of kinetic competency under the conditions of oxidative phosphorylation. These experiments provide evidence in support of the argument that energy conserved during the oxidation of substrates by the respiratory chain can be utilized to reduce the very tight binding of product ATP in high affinity catalytic sites and to promote dissociation of the nucleotide."

https://openalex.org/W1500429535,"The Ca2+-dependent association of beta-endorphin and trifluoperazine with porcine testis calmodulin, as well as the effects of removing Ca2+ by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) treatment, were investigated by the procedure of differential kinetic labeling. This technique permitted determination of the relative rates of acylation of each of the epsilon-amino groups of the seven lysyl residues on calmodulin by [3H]acetic anhydride under the different conditions. In all cases, less than 0.52 mol of lysyl residue/mol of calmodulin was modified, thus ensuring that the labeling pattern reflects the microenvironments of these groups in the native protein. Lysines 75 and 94 were found to be the most reactive amino groups in Ca2+-saturated calmodulin. In the presence of Ca2+ and under conditions where beta-endorphin and calmodulin were present at a molar ratio of 2.5:1, the amino groups of lysines 75 and 148 were significantly reduced in reactivity compared to calmodulin alone. At equimolar concentrations of peptide and protein, essentially the same result was obtained except that the magnitudes of the perturbation of these two lysines were less pronounced. With trifluoperazine, at a molar ratio to calmodulin of 2.5:1, significant perturbations of lysines 75 and 148, as well as Lys 77, were also found. These results further substantiate previous observations of a commonality between phenothiazine and peptide binding sites on calmodulin. Lastly, an intriguing difference in Ca2+-mediated reactivities between lysines 75 and 77 of calmodulin is demonstrated. In the Ca2+-saturated form of the protein, both lysines are part of the long connecting helix between the two homologous halves of the protein (Babu, Y. S., Sack, J. S., Greenhough, T. G., Bugg, C. E., Means, A. R., and Cook, W. J. (1985) Nature 315, 37-40). Yet, Lys 75 increases in reactivity some 25-fold, compared to only a 2-fold change for Lys 77, in going from EGTA-treated to Ca2+-saturated calmodulin. Thus, the microenvironment of Lys 75 is markedly altered upon Ca2+ binding, and this linker region between the two globular lobes of the protein appears to be quite important in the interaction of calmodulin with inhibitory molecules and perhaps activatable enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1551007985,"CTP synthetase from Escherichia coli catalyzes exchange of 18O from the beta gamma-bridge position of [gamma-18O4] ATP into the beta-nonbridge position. This positional isotope exchange occurs in the presence of UTP and MgCl2 but in the absence of NH3. The enzyme also has an ATPase activity in the presence of UTP that occurs under conditions that are identical to those used in the positional isotope exchange experiments. These data provide evidence for the stepwise nature of the reactions catalyzed by CTP synthetase with the initial step involving phosphorylation of UTP by ATP. The relative rate of the isotope exchange reaction is approximately 3 times faster than the ATPase reaction, but the isotope exchange rate is approximately 3% of the overall rate in the presence of NH3. These results are consistent with the ATPase reaction involving attack of water on the phosphorylated intermediate (4-phospho-UTP). The positional isotope exchange reaction is independent of the UTP concentration above saturating levels of UTP demonstrating that the order of addition of substrates is UTP followed by ATP and then NH3."

Here we have determined the mechanism of phosphorylation by separating dephosphorylated and phosphorylated myosin species based on their different structural properties in the minifilament buffer system (5 mM citrate, 22 mM Tris). Fully phosphorylated myosin remained assembled as minifilaments in 1 mM Mg-ATP, but dephosphorylated myosin dissociated to a mixture of folded monomers and dimers. Gel filtration was used to separate these two structures. At intermediate levels of phosphorylation, the relative amount of myosin that formed minifilament and dimer and the degree of phosphorylation of the separated species relative to the initial level of phosphorylation was measured. From these data, it was possible to deduce that singly and doubly phosphorylated myosin remained assembled in the presence of nucleotide. Myosin molecules with 0, 1, or 2 heads phosphorylated could also be separated by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. The amount of myosin which formed each species was quantitated as a function of phosphorylation. Results from the combined approaches are consistent with a model in which light chain kinase randomly phosphorylates myosin, independent of the state of aggregation of the myosin."
https://openalex.org/W1622835903,"The C-terminal region of the fibrinogen gamma chain is known to participate in several functional interactions including fibrin polymerization. This part of the molecule is retained on the gamma chain of fragment D (FgD) when fibrinogen is digested by plasmin in the presence of calcium to produce the fragment D-fragment E (FgD X FgE) complex but is lost if FgD is prepared in the absence of calcium. In an attempt to characterize the C-terminal polymerization domain we have used three techniques to examine this further degradation of FgD following the addition of EDTA and plasmin. Analysis of the digestion by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a progressive cleavage of the gamma chain to two small remnants. The polymerization-inhibitory activity of the whole digest was studied using acid-solubilized fibrin. A progressive loss of inhibitory activity was associated with gamma chain shortening, reaching greater than a 120-fold reduction at the end of digestion. The cleavage of peptides was followed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and the release of a characteristic peptide triplet was associated with gamma chain cleavage. Manual sequencing, amino acid analysis, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry established the three peptides as gamma 303-356, 357-373, and 374-405. These peptides have sequences in common with those peptides recently reported by other investigators to be potent polymerization inhibitors. However, when a mixture of the three peptides was added in a 200-fold molar excess to polymerizing fibrin, no inhibitory activity could be demonstrated. It is concluded that the C-terminal polymerization domain of fibrinogen may be an extended region which includes the sequence gamma 303-405, when this is contiguous with the remainder of the gamma chain."
https://openalex.org/W1600906060,"The regulatory light chains of dog heart myosin were removed by digestion with myopathic hamster neutral protease. The heavy chains were also cleaved to an extent of 15%, but a homogeneous, rod-free LC2-deficient myosin was obtained by ion-exchange chromatography. A similar approach was used to prepare LC2-deficient heavy meromyosin. Neither Ca2+- nor K+-EDTA-activated ATPases were affected by LC2 removal. The Lineweaver-Burk plots for actin-activated ATPase in 25 mM KCl were biphasic giving a Vmax of 1.54 s-1 for control and LC2-recombined myosins and 1.08 s-1 for LC2-deficient myosin at low actin concentrations. At high actin concentrations, the Vmax for control and recombined myosins was 2.33 s-1 and 1.39 s-1 for LC2-deficient myosin. Increasing the KCl concentration in the reaction mixtures resulted in more linear plots without suppressing the 35-45% decrease in Vmax that accompanied LC2 removal. The results from assays with control and LC2-deficient heavy meromyosin performed in the absence of KCl, paralleled those obtained with myosin. The latter was also assayed in the presence of equimolar concentrations of C-protein in 50 mM KCl: C-protein induced a significant increase in the actin-activated ATPase of both control and LC2-recombined myosins, with no effect on LC2-deficient myosin. The Vmax for actin-activation in the presence of C-protein was 2.38 s-1, 0.83 s-1, and 1.71 s-1 for control, LC2-deficient, and recombined myosins, respectively. The enhancement of actin-activation in both the control and LC2-recombined myosins represents a possible role for C-protein in a LC2-mediated potentiation of actomyosin ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1529777854,"Model building and energy minimization procedures have been used to determine a productive substrate binding mode in liver alcohol dehydrogenase for secondary alcohols. These docking results have been compared to some of the extensive amounts of kinetic data available for this enzyme. The indirect diamond lattice approach first suggested by Prelog (Prelog, V. (1964) Pure Appl. Chem. 9, 119-130) to describe the active site of an enzyme has been used to build a direct diamond lattice from the crystallographic model of the enzyme. This lattice was oriented and positioned into the active site using the productive binding mode of cyclohexanol derivatives obtained from model building. We then classified the positions as allowed, forbidden, or boundary depending on their distances to protein atoms. We found very good agreement between the classification of our direct diamond lattice points and those of the indirect lattice obtained by others from kinetic studies. Finally we have extended the lattice as an aid to predict the stereospecificity of the enzyme for molecules which cover other regions of the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1642970876,"Several conflicting reports have been made regarding the affinity of myosin heads (subfragment 1 and heavy meromyosin (HMM) for regulated actin (actin complexed with tropomyosin and troponin) at low ionic strength (mu = 18-50 mM) and whether or not this interaction is Ca2+ sensitive (Chalovich, J. M., and Eisenberg, E. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2432-2437; Chalovich, J. M., and Eisenberg, E. (1984) Biophys. J. 45, 221a; Wagner, P. D., and Stone, D. B. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 1334-1342; and Wagner, P. D. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 5950-5956). Since the low ionic strengths used in the above studies do not represent the physiological ionic strength under which intact muscle exhibits Ca2+-dependent tension development, we investigated the possibility of whether a Ca2+-dependent regulated actin-HMM interaction could be observed at physiological ionic strength (mu = 134 mM, pH 7.4) and in the presence of ATP (at 23-24 degrees C). Direct binding of HMM to varied concentrations of regulated actin (87.7-221 microM free actin) was measured by sedimentation in an air-driven ultracentrifuge. Under the above conditions, we found that the regulated actin activation of HMM-Mg2+-ATPase was about 94% inhibited in the absence of Ca2+ although the association constant (Ka) is only moderately affected in the presence of Ca2+. These results are similar to those obtained by Chalovich and Eisenberg (1982 and 1984) with subfragment 1 and HMM, respectively, at low ionic strength and support their suggestion that in solution tropomyosin-troponin may not act totally by physically blocking the formation of cross-bridges with actin, but instead may act to inhibit a kinetic step in the overall ATPase rate. Whether this holds true in more intact systems (e.g. myosin, thick filaments) remains to be determined. Our results also show a good correlation between levels of ATPase activation and HMM binding by unregulated actin and in regulated actin in the presence of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W2105408185,"Myosin purified from rabbit alveolar macrophages has been shown previously to be phosphorylated on the rod portion of the heavy chain and on the 20-kDa light chains (Trotter, J.A. (1982) Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 106, 1071-1077). Phosphorylation of the 20-kDa light chains by endogenous kinase activity is associated with a significant enhancement of the actin-activated MgATPase activity (Trotter, J.A., and Adelstein, R.S. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 8781-8785), whereas the function of heavy-chain phosphorylation is unknown. The isolated heavy chains of myosin purified from freshly harvested cells contain between 0.4 and 1.5 mol of PO4/mol of heavy chain, all esterified to serine residues. Using myosin phosphorylated by incubating living unstimulated macrophages in the presence of 32Pi, two-dimensional thin-layer mapping of tryptic peptides derived from heavy chains yields four phosphopeptides, which are phosphorylated to different extents. Limited trypsin digestion of similar radioactive myosin removes all radioactivity from the heavy chain while reducing its apparent molecular mass by less than 10 kDa. It is concluded that the heavy chain of macrophage myosin is phosphorylated on as many as four serines within 10 kDa of the tip of the tail."
https://openalex.org/W196947967,"Trypsin cleaves the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum into two major fragments (A and B), followed by subsequent cleavage into smaller peptides. Although the ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport is still observed after cleavage of the ATPase into the A and B fragments, the Ca2+ transport energized by acetyl phosphate is strongly inhibited. Covalent labeling of the Ca2+-ATPase by fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate inhibited both the ATP and acetyl phosphate-dependent Ca2+ transport. Vanadate protected the A and B fragments from further hydrolysis and preserved the ability of the cleaved Ca2+-ATPase to form crystals and to show the characteristic conformational changes in response to Ca2+ and EGTA that are observed with the intact enzyme. The protective effect of vanadate may be useful for the isolation of the A and B fragments in functional form."

https://openalex.org/W1517379024,"Abstract The carbohydrate structures of acid phosphatase and alpha-glucosidase secreted into culture medium by Tetrahymena pyriformis strain W were studied. Their asparagine-linked sugar chains were quantitatively liberated as radioactive oligosaccharides from their polypeptide moieties by controlled hydrazinolysis followed by N-acetylation and NaB3H4 reduction. The approximate amounts of total sugar chains liberated from 1 mol each of acid phosphatase and alpha-glucosidase were 6 and 4 mol, respectively. Paper electrophoresis revealed that only neutral oligosaccharides were obtained from both enzymes. The oligosaccharide fraction from acid phosphatase was separated into seven components by Bio-Gel P-4 column chromatography while that from alpha-glucosidase was resolved into three components. The structures of these oligosaccharides were determined by sequential glycosidase digestion in combination with methylation analysis. The sugar chains of the two enzymes can be primarily classified as high mannose-type oligosaccharides. However, they have the following characteristic features: 1) their common core is not the usual Man5 . GlcNAc2 structure, it is Man3 . GlcNAc2; 2) some of the sugar chains of acid phosphatase have 1 approximately 3 glucose residues linked to the nonreducing terminal Man alpha 1----2 residue. The structural characteristics of the sugar moieties of the two enzymes indicate that they might be produced by the so-called alternate pathway, in which lipid-linked Glc3 . Man5 . GlcNAc2 functions as an oligosaccharide donor."
https://openalex.org/W1497788221,"The three-dimensional structure of rabbit phosphoglucomutase has been determined to 2.7 A resolution by a combination of isomorphous and molecular replacement techniques. Heavy atom positions were found by using vector search and difference Fourier methods. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit form a dimer with its 2-fold axis perpendicular to and intersecting with a crystallographic 4(1) axis. Thus, the dimers are arranged so that they form fibers that are coincident with the 4(1) axes. A polypeptide model, corresponding with the known residue sequence, has been fitted to the electron density map to produce a structure that consists of four domains. All four have an alpha/beta structure; the first three have a somewhat similar topology that is based on a mixed parallel/antiparallel beta sheet, whereas the fourth is based on an antiparallel sheet. The active site lies between the four domains, with the phosphoserine residue in the first domain and some of the probable substrate-binding residues in the fourth and final domain. The carboxyl edges of all four sheets are directed towards the active site region, which lies in a deep crevice."
https://openalex.org/W1535273582,"Rabbit skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were loaded with Ca2+ by ATP-dependent Ca2+ accumulation in the presence of low [Mg2+] (0.2-0.5 mM), and Ca2+ release was induced by addition of caffeine or ADP or by means of a Ca2+ jump. The levels of the phosphorylated intermediate (EP) and the tryptophan fluorescence of the Ca2+-ATPase were monitored during both the Ca2+ accumulation and the induced Ca2+ release using fast kinetic techniques. During Ca2+ uptake, both the EP level and the tryptophan fluorescence gradually decreased following a time course similar to that of the Ca2+ accumulation. Upon inducing Ca2+ release by addition of either caffeine or ADP, there was a transient increase of the EP level (from 0.3-0.5 to 1-2 nmol/mg protein) preceding the release of Ca2+. Similarly, a transient increase of the tryptophan fluorescence prior to Ca2+ release produced by the application of a Ca2+ jump was also found. These results indicate that the Ca2+-ATPase enzyme undergoes a rapid conformational change in response to triggering of Ca2+ release."
https://openalex.org/W1580260922,"The Na+-Ca2+ exchange system in renal tubular basolateral membranes was partially purified and incorporated into liposomes. Solubilization of basolateral membranes with 1% cholic acid in the presence of 2.5% soybean phospholipids and proteolytic treatment with Pronase (20 micrograms/ml) as described (Wakabayashi, S., and Goshima, K. (1982) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 693, 125-133) allowed partial purification and reconstitution of the Na+-Ca2+ exchange system into liposomes. The Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in the reconstituted liposomes was 25 times higher than the Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in the native basolateral membranes. Eadie-Hofstee analysis of the Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake revealed a Vmax of 201 pmol of Ca2+/mg of protein/45 s and a Km for Ca2+ of 2.7 microM. The stoichiometry (n) of the Na+-Ca2+ exchange system was determined from the Na+ gradient which opposes constant membrane potential so that no net Ca2+ transport occurs. In the presence of constant negative membrane potential, the value for n was 3.09 +/- 0.22, and in the presence of constant positive membrane potential, the value for n was 2.89 +/- 0.2. Thus, the stoichiometry of the renal Na+-Ca2+ exchange system is approximately 3Na+:1Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1617531543,"Solvent isotope effects and the pH dependence of laccase catalysis under steady-state conditions were examined with a rapid reductant to assess the potential roles of protein protic groups and the catalytic mechanism. The pH dependence of both reductant-dependent and reductant-independent steps showed bell-shaped profiles implicating at least two protic groups in each case. The apparent pKa values were: for the reductant-independent step(s), pK alpha 1 = 8.98 +/- 0.02 and pK alpha 2 = 5.91 +/- 0.03; for the reductant-dependent step(s), pK' alpha 1 = 7.55 +/- 0.12, pK' alpha 2 = 8.40 +/- 0.23. No solvent isotope effect on reductant-dependent steps was detected other than a standard shift effect. However, a significant solvent isotope effect on a reductant-independent step(s) was observed; kH/kD = 2.12 at the pH optimum of 7.5. The concentration dependence of the D2O effect indicated that a single proton was involved. Simulations of the p(H,D) data suggested that the solvent isotope effect was associated with the protein protic group required in its undissociated form (pK alpha 2). The pH effects on reductant-dependent steps are apparently associated with reductant-dependent steps that occur between O2 binding and water formation in the catalytic reaction sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1570750566,"recA protein of Escherichia coli promotes a wide variety of DNA reactions in vitro. Specific effectors of recA protein should be very useful in elucidating the mechanisms of these complex reactions. Six mouse hybridoma clones that secreted class G immunoglobulins specific to recA protein were obtained in three cell-fusion experiments. Five IgGs were purified by affinity chromatography. These monoclonal antibodies were characterized by examining their effects on the single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity, negatively superhelical double-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity, and an activity in pairing negatively superhelical closed circular double-stranded DNA and homologous single-stranded DNA-fragments to form D-loops. These IgGs inhibited all, some, or one of these three activities, and from the spectra of their inhibitory effects they were classified into four groups. This classification suggests that each of the monoclonal antibodies binds to one of at least four antigenic determinants on recA protein and specifically inactivates one or more of the active centers on the protein. These monoclonal antibodies will be useful in analyzing the complex reactions promoted by recA protein."

https://openalex.org/W1504050019,"N-terminal sequence analysis shows that the limited proteolysis of Escherichia coli phosphofructokinase results in the removal of the 40-50 C-terminal residues of each chain. When tetrameric, this proteolyzed derivative is still active albeit insensitive to allosteric effectors (Le Bras, G., and Garel, J.-R. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 6656-6660). In the absence of fructose 6-phosphate, the proteolyzed phosphofructokinase spontaneously loses its activity and dissociates into dimeric species. This inactivation/dissociation is slowed down by the binding of fructose 6-phosphate to only part of the sites; it is completely prevented by the saturation of all four fructose 6-phosphate sites. The other substrate ATP does not protect the proteolyzed phosphofructokinase against this inactivation/dissociation. This inactivation/dissociation is not due to denaturation and can be reversed in some conditions by the addition of fructose 6-phosphate. The active tetrameric structure of phosphofructokinase is stable when either the C-terminal segment is not removed or the fructose 6-phosphate sites are occupied."
https://openalex.org/W1600246823,"The 5'-deoxy-5'-iodo-substituted analogs of adenosine and inosine are cytotoxic to tumor cells that have high activities of 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase, respectively (Savarese, T.M., Chu, S-H., Chu, M.Y., and Parks, R. E., Jr. (1984) Biochem. Pharmacol. 34, 361-367). 5-Iodoribose 1-phosphate (5-IRib-1-P), the common intracellular metabolite of these 5'-iodonucleosides, has been synthesized enzymatically from 5'-deoxy-5'-iodoadenosine via adenosine deaminase from Aspergillus oryzae and human erythrocytic purine nucleoside phosphorylase. The purification and chemical properties of 5-IRib-1-P are described. The analog sugar phosphate inhibited purine nucleoside phosphorylase from human erythrocytes, phosphoglucomutase from rabbit muscle, and 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase from Sarcoma 180 cells with Ki values of 26, 100, and 9 microM, respectively. Enzymes that react with 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (P-Rib-PP), P-Rib-PP amidotransferase, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, and orotate phosphoribosyltransferase-orotidylate decarboxylase from extracts of Sarcoma 180 cells, were inhibited with Ki values of 49, 465, 307, and 275 microM, respectively. 5-IRib-1-P had no effect on P-Rib-PP synthetase. Since the Ki values of the analog sugar phosphate for 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase and P-Rib-PP amidotransferase are much lower than the Km values of the natural substrates, Pi or P-Rib-PP which are reported to be present at nonsaturating concentrations under physiological conditions, these enzymes could be significantly inhibited by 5-IRib-1-P in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W153898970,"Extensive structural homology between the three nuclear RNA polymerases of Neurospora crassa has been observed by peptide and immunological analyses. Within each polymerase, we found structural similarity between subunits in the 65- to 75-kDa range and one of the two large subunits. We observed also that polymerase II, as isolated, is associated with a 700-kDa complex of 12 polypeptides which is localized in the nucleus. A 75-kDa subunit of the 700-kDa complex was found to be structurally related to the 220-kDa subunit of polymerase II. We suggest, on the basis of the in vitro association, the common nuclear localization and the structural homology, that the 700-kDa complex and polymerase II may be associated in vivo. Evidence is also presented which suggests that polymerase III may interact with chromatin via two of its smallest subunits. A simple procedure for isolating nuclei from Neurospora is described."
https://openalex.org/W1612344378,"The procedure of high performance ion-exchange chromatography has been used to fractionate subfragment 1 of myosin (SF1) into its isoenzymic forms. In contrast to conventional ion-exchange procedures which yield two fractions corresponding to SF1(A1) and SF1(A2), the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedure resolves SF1 into four discrete fractions. The first pair that is eluted appears to be A1-containing isoenzymes while the latter pair corresponds to the A2 forms based on their polypeptide compositions by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. By gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions it is not possible to differentiate between the two fractions corresponding to each isoenzyme. Although very minor differences between the fractions can be seen by the presence of extraneous peptides, these are present in far below stoichiometric amounts and, therefore, make it very unlikely that the superior fractionation by the HPLC procedure is based on their presence. An examination of the heavy chain heterogeneity in each of these fractions by peptide mapping revealed that the extra separation was based on this factor. Thus the HPLC procedure is capable of providing separation of SF1 into heavy chain-based isozymes as well as the light chain forms. ATPase measurements of these fractions reveal only minor differences in the Ca2+- and EDTA-activated ATPase."

In rats maintained on vitamin D-deficient diets for 5-7 weeks, in vivo administration of either vitamin D3, 2,000 IU orally, 5 days prior to killing or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 2.4 nmol, intraperitoneally, 24 h prior to killing failed to show any significant effect on (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity in MPM. (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity in MPM from rats maintained on vitamin D-deficient diet with high calcium content (1.8%) was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than that from rats maintained on vitamin D-deficient diet with low calcium content (0.3%). Moreover, in vitro addition of vitamin D3 metabolites did not show any effect on (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity in MPM. These data suggest that decreased (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity in MPM from long-term vitamin D-deplete rats resulted from an adaptation to low extracellular calcium rather than vitamin D depletion."

The Neurospora enzymes resemble, in polypeptide composition, the corresponding polymerases isolated from other eukaryotes. The 220-kDa subunit of Neurospora polymerase II cross-reacts with antisera directed against the 220-kDa subunits of type II polymerases from Drosophila and wheat germ. However, the proteolyzed 180-kDa derivative of the Neurospora 220-kDa subunit fails to cross-react with the heterologous antisera, suggesting that the region removed by proteolysis contains or contributes to structural features of the enzyme that have been highly conserved during evolution. A 700-kDa complex of 12 polypeptides was found associated with polymerase II during purification. The complex was eventually separated from the enzyme, and its properties suggest that it might be associated with polymerase II in the nucleus. We describe two additional examples of polypeptides associated in variable amounts with Neurospora polymerase II."
