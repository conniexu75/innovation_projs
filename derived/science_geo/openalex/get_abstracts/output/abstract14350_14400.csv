https://openalex.org/W2006122360,"Neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs inhibited the electrically stimulated release of [3-H] dopamine from rat striatal slices. The concentrations for 50 percent inhibition (ranging from 11.5 nanomolar for spiroperidol to 800 nanomolar for thioridazine) correlated closely with the average daily dosages of 25 neuroleptic drugs used clinically for schizophrenia. The correlation includes butyrophenones, phenothiazines, reserpine, pimozide, clozapine, and (plus)- butaclamol. Clinically inactive isomers [trans-thiothixene, trans-flupenthixol, and (minus)-butaclamol] required 20 to 1000 times higher concentrations than the active isomers to inhibit release. Compared to the inhibition of [3-H] dopamine release, much higher neuroleptic concentrations were needed to inhibit the electrically stimulated release of other neurotransmitters--[3-H] acetylcholine, [3-H-a1 (gamma-aminobutyric acid). The neuroleptic drugs may block the presynaptic coupling between impulse and neurosecretion."

The resultant data indicate that the primary generator of potential is the acoustic nerve; of potential 2, the cochlear nucleus; of potential 3, neurons of the superior olivary complex activated by projections crossing the midline; of potential 4, neurons of the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and preolivary region activated equally by crossed and uncrossed projections; and of potential 5, neurons of the inferior colliculus activated primarily by crossed projections."
https://openalex.org/W2020760594,"Duffy blood group negative human erythrocytes (FyFy) are resistant to infection by Plasmodium knowlesi, a simian malaria that infects Duffy positive human erythrocytes. The P. knowlesi resistance factor, Duffy negative erythrocytes, occurs in high frequency in West Africa, where the people are resistant to vivax malaria. This suggests that Duffy blood group determinants (Fya or Fyb) may be erythrocyte receptors for P. vivax."

They recognized a target picture as accurately and almost as rapidly when they knew only its meaning given by a name (for example, a boat) as when they had seen the picture itself in advance."
https://openalex.org/W1968066029,"The residual structural framework of the cell nucleus termed the nuclear protein matrix, is associated with newly synthesized DNA in regenerating rat liver. One minute after rats are injected with [3-H] thymidine, more than 90 percent of the total tritium in nuclear DNA is associated with the matrix DNA although this DNA comprises only 25 percent of the total nuclear DNA. In contrast, the bulk DNA, 75 percent of total nuclear DNA, contains less than 8 percent of the total labeled DNA. The percentage of total labeled DNA associated with the bulk DNA increases for 30 minutes after injection and decreases correspondingly in the matrix DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1997160062,"Rat electroretinograms were measured as a function of dietary supplements of purified ethyl esters of linolenic acid, linoleic acid, and oleic acid. Polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from precursors of linolenic and linoleic acids appear to be important functional components of photoreceptor cell membranes, although in equal dietary concentrations, linolenic acid precursors affect electroretinogram amplitudes to a greater extent than linoleic acid precursors. The electrical response of photoreceptor cell membranes appears to be a function of the position of the double bonds as well as a function of the total number of double bonds in fatty acid supplements."
https://openalex.org/W2034426268,Sexual behavior in male hamsters is totally abolished by bilateral removal of the olfactory bulbs. This operation eliminates sensory input from both the olfactory and the vomeronasal systems. We previously demonstrated that peripheral destruction of the olfactory receptors caused anosmia but did not impair male hamster mating behavior. Here we demonstrate that peripheral deafferentation of the vomeronasal system produces severe sexual behavior deficits in approximately one-third of the treated animals. Combined deafferentation of both the vomeronasal and the olfactory systems eliminates copulation in 100 percent of the animals. This is the first experimental demonstration of a functional role for the vomeronasal organ in a mammalian species.
https://openalex.org/W2072389657,"A mutant strain of Beijerinckia, after growth with succinate plus biphenyl, contains an enzyme system that oxidizes benzo [a] pyrene and benzo [a] anthracene to mixtures of vicinal dihydrodiols. The major dihydrodiol formed from benzo [a] pyrene was identified as cis-9, 10-dihydroxy-9, 10-dihydrobenzo [a] pyrene by comparison with a synthetic sample. Benzo [a] anthracene was metabolized to four dihydrodiols, the major isomer being cis-1, 2-dihydroxy-1, 2-dihydroxy-1, 2-dihydrobenzo [a] anthracene."
https://openalex.org/W2094011638,"Perfusion of rat kidneys with the polycation protamine sulfate caused glomerular epithelial alterations resembling those observed in human and experimental nephrotic states. The changes included swelling, blunting, and flattening of epithelial foot processes, were accompanied by decreased stainability of glomerular anionic sites, and were largely reversed by subsequent perfusion with the polyanion heparin."
https://openalex.org/W1975211276,"The terrestrial slug Limax maximus can lean to avoid new palatable food if CO2 poisoning is paired with igestion of the new food. Some animals learn in one trail and remember without error for 3 weeks. Avoidance most commonly consists of complete rejection of the unsafe food, based on olfactory cues. This preparation offers the opportunity for detailed neurophysiological analysis of a rapid-onset learning mechanism of long duration."
https://openalex.org/W2024586219,"Flavonoids are effective inhibitors of lens aldose reductase. Quercetin, quercitrin, and myricitrin are significantly more potent than the previously known aldose reductase inhibitors. The inhibitory activity is of the noncompetitive type. In addition, quercitrin effectively blocks polyol accumulation in intact rat lenses incubated in medium containing high concentration of sugars."
https://openalex.org/W2047161129,"Bank swallows nest gregariously in colonies usually ranging from 10 to 300 nests. Different pairs within the same colony are highly synchronized with each other, and 67 percent of the nests fledged their young over a period of only 6 days. This high degree of synchronization is demonstrated to be of adaptive significance. Reproductive fitness increases as a function of the precision of synchrony of the colony. It is proposed that social foraging plays an important role in maximizing the feeding efficiency in this species and that asynchronous breeding decreases the effectiveness of this social foraging, particularly in late nesters and among young, newly fledged birds. An individual that fledges either early or at the peak of synchrony will emerge to find a steady stream of other bird traveling to local, ephemeral, concentrations of food. The late emerger finds itself practically alone and thus is deprived of the potential benefits of the pooled information about locations of food resources available to the full colony."
https://openalex.org/W2024722093,"THE β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol is an effective antihypertensive drug in man1 but it is not known how the fall in blood pressure is produced2. There is a decrease in plasma renin activity3 and in cardiac output immediately on starting propranolol therapy but neither of these effects can explain fully the hypotensive action of the drug which is delayed in onset and associated with a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance4. It has been suggested that the fall in blood pressure after propranolol results from blockade of β-like adrenoceptors within the central nervous system5. Thus, intracerebroventricular injection of propranolol lowers blood pressure in conscious cats5 and rabbits6, an effect which is specific for the β-blocking (—) isomer of the drug7. The effective concentration of propranolol achieved in the hypothalamus by this route of administration is within the range predicted for hypertensive patients after chronic oral therapy8. We now present direct evidence that propranolol diminishes sympathetic nerve activity in the rabbit and that this central effect contributes to the hypotensive action of the drug."
https://openalex.org/W1970512054,"An angiotensin II inhibitor was administered to rats with two-kidney Goldblatt hypertension. The inhibitor produced a marked drop in blood pressure after 5 weeks but no significant change after 15 weeks of hypertension. However, even after 15 weeks of hypertension, following sodium depletion by either diuretics or a low sodium diet, the animals again became renin dependent as readministration of the inhibitor induced a significant fall in blood pressure. The data indicate that two-kidney Goldblatt hypertension is initially renin dependent but subsequently becomes sodium volume dependent in a way similar, although more protracted, to that already described for one-kidney Goldblatt hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2077775841,A pentapeptide was synthesized with the same amino acid sequence that occurs in a unique region of the chaim of immunoglobulin E near the cysteine residue participating in the linkage between the two heavy chains. This pentapeptide has the capacity to block a standard Prausnitz-Küstner reaction as well as to inhibit a known positive skin test reaction. Other similar synthetic polypeptides had less or no inhibitory activity. The likelihood that this pentapeptide amino acid sequence does in fact represent the structure of the specific immunoglobulin E binding site for the mast cell and basophil is considered.

https://openalex.org/W1991699174,"Over a period of 2 weeks, adult cats were twice a day exposed for 1 hour to a visual environment consisting only of vertical stripes and for the rest of the time were kept in darkness. Subsequent investigation of the striate cortex showed a decrease in the number of neurons sensitive to orientations around the vertical relative to those sensitive to horizontal orientations. This indicates that plasticity of functional properties of the cortical neuronal network still exists in adult animals."
https://openalex.org/W2094604709,"A modification of the Euler equation is used to describe a simple parasite life history in which survival decreases with age at a rate determined by mortality of the parasitized host. The advantages of castration of hosts by parasites are discussed using the modified equation in which castration is equivalent to reducing parasite virulence in the host to near zero or zero. It is suggested that castrating parasites can infest a wider range of hosts with higher mortality rates and that within parasite groups having castrating and noncastrating species, the former should infest hosts with higher mortality rates and relatively larger gonads."
https://openalex.org/W2082441832,"Cells lying on the ventricular surface of the hypothalamic ependyma of the tegu lizard exhibit the pseudopodial and flaplike processes characteristic of macrophages found elsewhere. Since they ingest latex beads, they may be considered a resident phagocytic system of the brain. The importance of ependyma and ventricular phagocytes as a first line of defense against viral invasion of the brain, as well as their role in the pathogenesis of certain virus-related diseases, is suggested by a number of experimental and clinical observations."
https://openalex.org/W2000390216,"In order to block acetylcholine receptors of muscle, the alpha toxin of the Formosan cobra (Naja naja atra) was given intravenously to rats. Electrophysiological and pharmacological changes typical of myasthenia gravis were recorded, including decremental responses to repetitive stimuli, curare sensitivity, neostigmine reversal, and posttetanic phenomena. This model supports the concept that a reduction of available acetylcholine receptors may play an important role in myasthenia gravis."
https://openalex.org/W2047052902,Thiocarbamate sulfoxides formed on metabolic sulfoxidation of thicoarbamate herbicides in plants and mammals are effective carbamoylating agents for glutathione and other tissue thiols. Dichloracetamides that protect corn from thiocarbamate herbicide injury more rapid detoxification of the thiocarbamate sulfoxides by increasing their rate of carbamoylation of glutathione through elevation of the root glutathione level and glutathione s-transferase activity.
https://openalex.org/W1977836910,"Lactosyl ceramide beta-galactosidase activities in the fibroblasts from the previously described patient with so-called ""lactosyl ceramidosis"" were reexamined with the two recently developed assay methods which appear to measure two genetically distinct enzymes that can degrade this substrate. No deficiency of either of the lactosyl ceramide-cleaving enzymes was observed. In addition, sphingomyelinase activity was only one-sixth of normal, while all other enzymes examined were within the normal ranges."
https://openalex.org/W1975162775,"In the rat the deep body temperature rhythm, monitored by telemetry, can be reset in a predictable direction by a stimulant (theopylline) and by a depressant (pentobarbital). When the drugs are applied immediately before or during the early active phases of the circadian cycle, the rhythm is set back (phase delay). When applied later, past the thermal peak, theophylline, but not pentobarbital, shifts the rhythm ahead (phase advance). Theophylline and pentobarbital in addition to having a number of already established pharmacological properties are now further identified as chronobiotics: they are drugs that may be used to alter the biological time structure by rephasing a circadian rhythm."

https://openalex.org/W1975980752,"Electron microscopic observations suggest that the rodlike and conelike photoreceptors of diurnal tree squirrels shed outer segment discs. Twenty-four hours after injection of triated L-leucine, the rodlike photoreceptors show a band of radioactivity at the base of the outer segment. The conelike photoreceptor outer segments show only a pattern of diffuse labeling. These results strongly suggest that disc shedding can occur in photoreceptor outer segments in which proteins are diffusely renewed."

The 3-deoxy analog acted significantly more rapidly than vitamin D3 and only slightly slower than lalpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Comparison of the dose-response curves of these three vitamin D derivatives emphasizes the importance of the 3beta-hydroxyl group to biological activity."

Consequently, rates of sequence variation depend on whether the constituent amino acids of individual proteins are, over-all, more subject or less subject to evolutionary substitution than normal. Such rates correlate well with a mutability term based on amino acid composition."
