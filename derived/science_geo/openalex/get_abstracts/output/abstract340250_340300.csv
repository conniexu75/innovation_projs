https://openalex.org/W2000272403,"I have discussed Chan Chan in terms of its political and economic characteristics because state organization had a pervasive impact on the growth and structure of the settlement. In this sense the capital of Chimor resembles Cuzco the Inca capital (1). Both metropolitan centers served as seats of Andean empires governed by noble classes headed by members of royal dynasties. Each state relied on a system of labor taxation and controlled the production, collection, and redistribution of goods. These political and economic institutions gave the sites distinctive but parallel forms. First, the settlements were large, containing a great deal of monumental architecture, but size and construction do not reflect substantial populations because building was done by nonresident work forces. Second, the urban proletariat were relatively few in numbers and composed of retainers or service personnel at Cuzco, as well as craftsmen and artisans at Chan Chan. Third, civic facilities were intended to serve the aristocracy and the state, not the common citizenry because these were governmental, not folk or popular, centers. And, fourth, palaces tied up a great amount of urban space because each monarch built his own seat of government during life and this became a monument to his name after death. In conclusion, I cannot say Chan Chan and Cuzco are necessarily typical of other prehistoric population centers in the region because these centers are little studied. I can, however, say Chan Chan was distinct from the preindustrial cities of Europe and Mesopotamia, but this is not surprising because the capital of Chimor was the product of distinctly Andean cultural institutions."

The release of pre-existing subsurface liquid water, such as that trapped under a permafrost layer, by meteorite impact or tectonic activity could produce sufficient flow and would not require heat transfer. The presence of water in a CO2 hydrate is shown to be detrimental to its release from an underground reservoir."

https://openalex.org/W2026044993,"The high-temperature forms of cristobalite and tridymite have been found occurring in a Middle Eocene, radiolarian-rich claystone. Evidence indicates that these crystals formed at low temperature and were chemical precipitates. Scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (microprobe), and x-ray diffraction provided the data upon which the determinative mineralogy was based."

https://openalex.org/W2091452445,Thermistor chain measurements of internal wave motions below the thermocline in the western North Atlantic have been spectrally decomposed in vertical-horizontal wave number space. The measured two-dimensional spectrum exhibits a systematic deviation from the corresponding Garrett and Munk model for internal wave spectra.

They are roughly lenticular. bilobed fossils up to 11 millimeters in diamiter and 8 milllimeters thic. These objects consistently asymmetrical in the same direction. defy placement in any known higher taxon when their morphology. histology, and apatitic composition considered."
