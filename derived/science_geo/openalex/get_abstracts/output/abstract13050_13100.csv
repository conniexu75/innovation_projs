https://openalex.org/W1529689987,"Using radioimmunoassay, the distribution of radioimmunoassayable neurotensin (R-NT) has been determined in acid/acetone extracts of tissues from week-old and adult rats. Whereas only 10% of the R-NT in week-old rats was found in the head, 90% was found in extracts of the body, and 85% was present in the intestine. The distribution of R-NT in the central nervous system of adult male rats was as follows: hypothalamus (35%), brain stem (35%), cerebral cortex (17%), thalamus (11%), cerebellum (1%), and pituitary gland (1%). Concentrations of R-NT were highest in the hypothalamus (60 pmol/g) and lowest in the cerebellum (0.8 pmol/g). More than 10 times as much R-NT was found in extracts of adult rat small intestine than in brain. The concentration of R-NT was highest in the jejuno-ileal section of the intestine (approximately 50 pmol/g) but it was also detected in the esophogus, stomach, duodenum, and large intestine (approximately 1 to 8 pmol/g) than the remaining muscle layer (approximately 40 pmol/g). Rat jejuno-ileal R-NT co-chromatographed with neurotensin on Sephadex G-25, displayed equal immunological potency with the antisera utilized, and was destroyed by enzymes known to cleave neurotensin. High concentrations (approximately 400 pmol/g) of an R-NT of smaller molecular weight than neurotensin were found in rat stomach. This peptide reacted most strongly with a COOH-terminal-directed antiserum and appeared to be four to five amino acids in length; it might possibly be a breakdown product of neurotensin or a related peptide with biological activity. Acid/acetone extracts of rat and bovine plasma were found to contain an R-NT which displayed the properties of neurotensin (approximately 50 fmol/ml) as well as a substance which behaved similarly to the small molecular weight stomach R-NT (approximately 1000 fmol/ml)."
https://openalex.org/W2093541219,"We propose that the basic unit of chromatin is constructed of two isologously paired heterotypic protein tetramers each containing one molecule of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histone. These proteins form a core that holds 140 base pairs (bp) of DNA in a single left-handed, non-interwound DNA supercoil approximately 95 bp in circumference, creating A nucleosome particle (DNA and protein) organized about a dyad axis of symmetry. Such a nucleosome can open up into its separate half-nucleosomes to allow genetic readout without requiring histone displacement"
https://openalex.org/W1486529618,"Four derivatives of pepstatin, each of which contains the unusual amino acid 4-amino-3-hydroxy-6-methylheptanoic acid (statine) have been prepared. All four are porcine pepsin inhibitors. Both N-acetylstatine and N-acetyl-alanyl-statine are competitive inhibitors for pepsin with Ki values of 1.2 X 10(-4) M and 5.65 X 10(-6) M, respectively. The Ki values for N-acetyl-valyl-statine is 4.8 X 10(-6) M. These statyl derivatives, therefore, are very strong inhibitors. The Ki value for N-acetyl-statine is 600-fold smaller than that of its structural analog N-acetyl-leucine. The derivative which contains two statyl residues in a tetrapeptide exhibits inhibitory properties which approach those of pepstatin itself. Other acid proteases, human pepsin, human gastricsin, renin, cathepsin D, the acid protease from Rhizopus chinensis and bovine chymosin, also are inhibited by pepstatin and its derivatives. It is suggested that the statyl residue is responsible for the unusual inhibitory capability of pepstatin and that statine is an analog of the previously proposed transition state for catalysis by pepsin and other acid proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1490542744,"Radioimmunoassayable neurotensin (R-NT) has been isolated from acid/acetone extracts of 50 kg of calf small intestine with an overall yield of approximately 15%. The concentration of R-NT in calf intestinal tissue was approximately 35 pmol/g wet weight. Throughout the purification procedures which involved adsorption onto sulfopropyl (SP)-Sephadex, chromatography on Sephadex G-25 and SP-Sephadex, immunoadsorption on neurotensin-antibody Sepharose and high voltage paper electrophoresis, R-NT displayed the chromatographic and electrophoretic properties of neurotensin. R-NT was found to contain a tridecapeptide with the same amino acid composition as neurotensin. This peptide yielded the same products as neurotensin when submitted to digestion by carboxypeptidase A or papain. Its immunological properties were indistinguishable from those of neurotensin and its potency in stimulating hypotension in anesthetized rats was comparable to that of synthetic neurotensin. If the amino acid sequence of this peptide proves to be the same as that of neurotensin, then neurotensin is another biologically active peptide isolated from both brain and intestinal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1485697636,"A highly sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay for neurotensin has been developed which utilizes 125I-labeled neurotensin and rabbit antisera raised toward synthetic neurotensin which has been coupled specifically through its lysine side chain to several proteins. The three antisera described have different specificities but are directed primarily towards the COOH-terminal region of neurotensin which is the biologically active portion of the molecule. Two of the antisera, poly(Glu60, Lys40) (from animal no. 4) and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (from animal no. 8), cross-react fully with COOH-terminal partial sequences of neurotensin while antiserum poly(Glu60, Lys40) (from animal no. 6) requires the entire molecule for full recognition. The assay can detect less than 3 fmol of neurotensin and the dose-response curves for synthetic and native neurotensin are superimposable, irrespective of the antiserum employed. Using these assay systems, the immunoactivity in acid/acetone extracts of 45 kg of bovine hypothalami was purified to homogeneity and shown to be attributable to intact neurotensin and not to fragments of neurotensin nor to related molecules. Radioimmunoassayable neurotensin (R-NT) obtained from bovine, rat, guinea pig, and rabbit hypothalami also gave dose-response curves which paralleled that of neurotensin and the neurotensin equivalents per g of wet tissue were in the range 45 to 70 pmol/g. Measurements with the three antisera were in agreement, especially after the extracts were chromatographed on Sephadex G-25; R-NT in these hypothalamic extracts has also been shown to be destroyed by treatment with various enzymes known to cleave neurotensin."

https://openalex.org/W1511229070,"The quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of T4-coded gene 32-protein on binding to nucleotide ligands, which was described in the preceding paper, is here exploited to measure thermodynamic parameters of the single-stranded nucleic acid-gene 32-protein interaction. It is shown that binding of small ligands follows a single site binding isotherm, with association constants increasing from approximately 20 M-1 for phosphate, to approximately 10(3) M for ribose or deoxyribose 5'-phosphate, to approximately 10(4) M-1 for mononucleotides, and to approximately 10(5) M-1 for dinucleoside monophosphates (all in 0.1 M Na+). The measured binding constants appear to be about the same for homologous ribose- and deoxyribose-containing ligands and to be independent of oligonucleotide base sequence and composition. Furthermore, beyond the dinucleotide level and up to octanucleotides, the increase in binding constant with increasing chain length is only about that expected from the statistical factor resulting from the increased number of ways a longer oligonucleotide can form a protein complex. This suggests that the basic binding unit involved in gene 32-protein associations with single-stranded nucleic acids can be approximated by a dinucleoside monophosphate. Oligonucleotides long enough to accomodate two or more protein monomers are characterized by much larger association constants, indicating that binding is cooperative in protein concentration. A cooperativity parameter (omegac) of approximately 10(3) is estimated from these data, in good agreement with that deduced from the application of ligand-perturbed helix in equilibrium coil transition calculations. Values of association constants (Kcomegac) of approximately 10(8) M-1 (in 0.1 M Na+) and site size (nc) of approximately 5 (+/-1) nucleotide residues/protein monomer are determined by the fluorescence titration technique for the cooperative binding of gene 32-protein to both poly(dA) and poly(rA); these values are also in agreement with those measured by Jensen et al. (Jensen, D.E. Kelly, R.C., and von Hippel, P.H. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 7215-7228). Possible in vivo consequences and correlations of these findings with proposed roles for gene 32-protein in replication and recombination are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1983326843,"Induction of erythroid differentiation in ouabain-resistant murine erythroleukemia cells by ouabain is reported. Ouabain induction results in the appearance of hemoglobin-containing cells 12–24 hr earlier than induction of the same clone by dimethyl sulfoxide. The levels of globin mRNA after ouabain induction are similar in amount to the globin mRNA levels observed after induction by dimethyl sulfoxide. The concentration of ouabain required to induce hemoglobin synthesis depends upon the K+ ion levels in the culture medium. Lowering the extracellular K+ ion concentration 2–4 fold reduced by 10–40 fold the ouabain concentration necessary for the induction of hemoglobin synthesis. In low K+ medium (1.8 mM), ouabain is an effective inducer of hemoglobin synthesis at a concentration of 0.02 mM. This K+ effect is specific for ouabain induction, since induction by other inducers, such as dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethyl acetamide, does not exhibit this marked sensitivity to the levels of K+ ions in the culture medium. These results suggest that the binding of ouabain to the plasma membrane enzyme, ATPase, is required for the induction of erythroid differentiation by ouabain. A small but significant proportion of wild-type, ouabain-sensitive cells also can be induced by ouabain, below ouabain concentrations that are toxic to these cells. The observation that the binding of ouabain to the ATPase induces hemoglobin synthesis suggests that changes in the intracellular concentration of K+ ions may be involved in the control of erythroid differentiation in Friend erythroleukemic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1595472253,"Divalent cations are required for two roles in prothrombin-phospholipid interaction. The first role, catalysis of a prothrombin protein transition has a reaction half-life of 100 min at 0 degrees and is a prerequisite to phospholipid binding. The binding sites required for the transition have a very low cation specificity. All di- and trivalent cations tested were effective in this role with the exception of beryllium. Barium catalyzed the transition but only at high concentrations (6.6 mM was required for half-reaction). Blood-clotting Factor X, another gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein, also undergoes a cation-catalyzed protein transition which is a prerequisite to Factor X-phospholipid binding. In both proteins, the transition can be monitored by a decrease in the protein's intrinsic fluorescence. Compared to prothrombin, the Factor X transition occurs much more rapidly, has a somewhat greater specificity for cations, and requires higher concentrations of cations. This indicates that the cation binding sites provided by gamma-carboxyglutamic acid are not completely uniform in all proteins. The second role of divalent cations in prothrombin-phospholipid interaction is in the actual protein-phospholipid binding. This interaction was studied by protein fluorescence quenching resulting from excitation energy transfer to a chromophore attached to the phospholipid membrane. Only strontium and barium satisfactorily replaced calcium in this role. A number of other cations form protein-phospholipid complexes but of the wrong structure. These cations inhibit the prothrombinase complex (Factor Xa, calcium, phospholipid, Factor V). The cation specificity for Factor X-phospholipid binding is the same as for prothrombin except that higher concentrations of cations are required. Factor Xa (generated by action of Russell's viper venom on Factor X) displayed the same calcium requirements for the protein transition and phospholipid interaction as Factor X. The cation requirements of the prothrombinase complex correlate with the cation requirements of prothrombin and Factor X-phospholipid binding. Strontium is the only cation that will singly replace calcium. Barium is ineffective alone because the concentrations required to catalyze the protein transitions cause precipitation of the phospholipid. Combination of certain other cations with barium will, however, substitute for calcium. The other cations (specifically magnesium or manganous ion) catalyze the protein transitions and barium forms the correct protein-phospholipid complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1998555020,"Two models were tested for the mode of distribution of histone nu bodies at the replication fork. The replication fork was labeled by brief incubation of cells with 3H-thymidine. Nuclei were isolated and digested with low levels of micrococcal nuclease, and the kinetics of cleavage of the pulse-labeled chromatin DNA were compared to the kinetics of clevage of perental chromatin DNA. In chromatin labeled for 30 sec to 10 min, the rate of cleavage of the pulse-labeled region into monomeric nu body-sized units exceeded the rate of cleavage of parental chromatin by a factor of 2, but did not approach the predicted value of 5-6 for random segregation. This value dropped to 1.6 in 15 min and was equivalent to perental chromatin in 20 min labeling experiments. DNA synthesized in the presence of cycloheximide was also digested at twice the rate of parental chromatin DNA. A Poisson analysis of the kinetics of cleavage by micrococcal nuclease further confirmed these observations. The predicted difference in the rate of production of monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric deoxyribonucleoprotein units was very similar to the experimental values of both total chromatin and nascent chromatin. Thus the nu body spacings in newly replicated chromatin closely approximate those in parental chromatin. These results agree well with a conservative or nondispersive model of nucleosome distribution in which the proteins are associated with one of the two daughter chromosomes during replication."
https://openalex.org/W1587011352,"Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease is a DNA protein, since it binds with greater overall affinity to the single-stranded than to the double-stranded form of natural and synthetic deoxyribose-containing polynucleotides. As such, the DNA-RNase system provides a simple model for the more complex and biologically relevant melting protein-nucleic acid systems. Aspects of the DNA-RNase interactions which are related to the quantitative assessment of this system as a melting protein model are investigated here. A boundary sedimentation velocity technique is used to measure thermodynamic parameters of the interaction; association constants (Kh and Kc) and site sizes (nh and nc) are determined for the interaction of ribonuclease with native (double helical) and denatured (random coil) DNA. It is shown that log Kh and log Kc are linear functions of log [Na+], binding decreasing with increasing Na+ concentration, with Kh about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than Kc at the ionic strengths studied, nh and nc are approximately 8 and approximately 11 nucleotide residues, respectively, indicating that potential binding sites overlap. Binding to both forms of DNA is non-cooperative. It is shown by CD and ultraviolet spectroscopy that the binding of RNase to single- and double-stranded DNA perturbs the conformations of these polynucleotide conformations very little relative to the unliganded structures. Hydrodynamic methods are used to show that RNase binds to native DNA without altering the overall solution structure of the latter; however conditons which permit binding to, and stabilization of, transiently exposed single-stranded sequences result in a collapse of the stiff native DNA structure. We demonstrate by melting transition studies that ribonuclease does bring about an equilibrium destabilization of native DNA and poly [d(A-T)] and, by applying a ligand-perturbed helic in equilibrium coil theory developed by McGhee (McGhee, J.D. (1976) Biopolymers 15, 1345-1375), it is shown that the extent of the observed destabilization is in semiquantitative accord with expectations based on the measured affinity constants and site sizes for RNase binding to both DNA conformations. Spectral methods are used to show that the relative stability of native DNA sequences of varying base composition is the same in the presence and absence of ribonuclease, strongly arguing that this ligand traps single-stranded sequences transiently exposed by thermal fluctuations. RNase also undergoes an order in equilibrium disorder conformational transition as a function of temperature (the denatured form of RNase stabilizes native DNA, while native RNase destabilizes the native double helix), and the coupled equilibria involved in these interacting conformational changes are interpreted and discussed as possible models of genome regulatory interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2023892440,"Analysis of the DNA of several diverse dinoflagellates and other algae has revealed that the presence of the base hydroxymethyluracil (HOMeU) is a feature common among the DNA's of dinoflagellates; this base has not been found in any other group of eukaryotes that has been examined. Among examined members of the dinoflagellates, the ratio of the base pairs HOMeU⋅A to T⋅A, where A is adenine and T is thymine, ranges from 0.14 to 2.13. In addition to hydroxymethyluracil, the DNA of one dinoflagellate contains methylcytosine, and that of another contains methyladenine, while the DNA of other dinoflagellates contains no detectable amounts of either of these two bases."
https://openalex.org/W1489526716,"Maleimides impermeant to human erythrocyte membranes have been synthesized and applied to studies of the sulfhydryl groups of the membrane. Reaction of radioactive dextran-maleimide and glutathione-maleimide with either intact erythrocytes or ghosts yields sulfhydryl titers for the outer (exofacial) and inner (endofacial) surfaces, respectively, of 1.5 to 1.7 and 27 to 28 amol/cell. Corresponding values for sulfhydryl groups within the membrane interior, as estimated with radioactive N-ethylmaleimide, are 16 to 22 amol/cell. After exofacial labeling of intact cells with [35S]glutathione-maleimide, autoradiography of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels demonstrates four bands (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) containing, respectively, 13%, 63%, 11%, and 13% of the radioactivity. The major beta-band corresponds in position to polypeptides of molecular weight 40,000 to 70,000 and to Coomassie brilliant blue-stained Band 5. Selective extraction demonstrates that the major Band 5 protein is not identical with the labeled beta-band polypeptides. Following endofacial labeling of ghosts with [35S]glutathione-maleimide, autoradiography reveals radioactivity in all of the major Coomassie brilliant blue bands. The impermeant maleimides described are also applicable to studies of discrete functional proteins of the erythrocyte membrane, including the hexose transport mechanism and the major Rho antigenic site."
https://openalex.org/W1675724485,"The facilitated diffusion of D-glucose across human erythrocyte membranes requires an exofacial (outer surface) sulfhydryl group which can be alkylated by the impermeant reagents glutathione-maleimide and dextran-maleimide. The irreversible inhibition produced by these reagents is asymmetric; inhibition of glucose efflux considerably exceeds that of influx when transport is assayed in the absence of glucose on the opposite side of the membrane. Both D-glucose and cytochalasin B protect the exofacial transport site from alkylation by the impermeant maleimides. This masking effect provides the basis for a two-step procedure for differential labeling of the outer transport site with radioactive glutathione-maleimide. The method labels clearly and consistently a component of the membrane proteins which migrates in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels between Coomassie brilliant blue-stained Bands 4.2 and 5, corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of 65,000 to 70,000. Transport studies after inhibition with N-ethylmaleimide suggest that the hexose mechanism also requires a second sulfhydryl group which is not accessible at the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1558971398,"Aggregation properties of gangliosides, the major synaptic membrane glycosphingolipids of mammalian brain, may prevent their segregation during membrane assembly and promote a uniform membrane matrix with minimum maintenance energy. The sphingosine residues of bovine brain gangliosides show an increase in C20-sphingosine corresponding with an increase in sialic acid. Concentrations of C20-sphingosine varied from 37% for the monosialoganglioside to 64% for the trisialoganglioside, the remainder being C18-sphingosine. Ultracentrifugal analysis showed that changes in sialic acid content and in C20-sphingosine content individually affect micellar size. Increases in sialic acid content decreased micellar size from 225 for the monosialoganglioside to 120 monomersper micelle for the trisialoganglioside. Monosialogangliosides enzymatically prepared from oligosialohomologues with a higher C20-sphingosine content gave evidence for a considerable effect of C20sphingosine upon the free energy of the aggregate form; the number of monomers per micelle increased from 225 for the natural monosialoganglioside to 280 for monosialoganglioside derived from trisialoganglioside. The similar aggregation energies of the major synaptic membrane gangliosides apparently result from a metabolic balancing of increased C20-sphingosine with increased sialic acid content."
https://openalex.org/W1998478452,"50% of control DNA is resistant to staphylococcal nuclease after digestion in isolated nuclei, while only 25% of the labeled DNA made in the presence of cycloheximide is resistant to nuclease. Nevertheless, cycloheximide DNA is folded into normal chromosomal subunits as evidenced by the observation that it generates nuclese limit-digest DNA fragments that are indistinguishable from controls. These results indicate that cycloheximide chromatin is associated with half the number of normal nu bodies. These nu bodies are probably recycled from the parental chromosome. Partial nuclease digestion of cycloheximide chromatin reveals that a normal pattern of monomer and multimer DNA fragments is generated up to octamers. The data are consistent with the idea that in the presence of cycloheximide, recycled parental histones become cooperatively aligned along the daughter double helices."

https://openalex.org/W2035992065,"THERE is considerable interest in the relationship between chemical structure, both configurational and conformational and the sweet response1 particularly in the case of sucrose (1) since, of all the sweetening agents it is the most widely used. Hitherto, no derivative of sucrose nor any other carbohydrate has shown sweetness substantially greater than that of sucrose, indeed to the contrary sucrose octa-acetate is very bitter, sucrose monoesters are much less sweet and galacto-sucrose (2), a C4 epimer of sucrose, is greatly diminished in sweetness2. Nevertheless, one of the objectives in our studies on the chemistry of sucrose has been to modify its structure, by chemical means in order to enhance its natural sweetness and in the process prevent metabolism by inhibiting breakdown by invertase. We have now been greatly encouraged by the surprising discovery that a galacto-sucrose derivative, namely 1′,4,6,6′-tetrachloro-galacto-sucrose (3) is intensely sweet, comparable with saccharin but without an unpleasant after-taste."

https://openalex.org/W1905228138,"Detached tomato leaves, supplied with the proteinase inhibitor inducing factor (PIIF) and incubated with water under constant light, exhibited a specificity of intracellular protein turnover directed toward the selective accumulation of heat-stable proteins having disulfide corss-linkages. Approximately 70% of the accumulated proteins could be accounted for in two proteinase inhibitors rich in disulfide links. The accumulation of proteins containing disulfides was accompanied by a net loss in total leaf protein, mainly of heat-precipitable proteins having free sulfhydryl residues. Relative rates of synthesis of --S--S-- proteins and --SH proteins were assessed by comparing rates of incorporation of isotope into the inhibitor proteins and noninhibitor leaf proteins. Although the inhibitors represented about 12% of total leaf protein after 71 h of induction, only about 2% of total protein synthesis was directed toward inhibitor synthesis during incubation of induced leaves. The marked stability of inhibitors, and other disulfide proteins against degradation in vivo, appeared to be a major factor providing for their selective accumulation. It was concluded that the state of oxidation of protein-bound half-cystine residues may be a principle parameter influencing the susceptibility of leaf proteins to degradation in vivo."

Nomura M. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 71. 1974: 3819-3823 Google Scholar ). Since guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) had been implicated in stringent control, we examied the effects of ppGpp on the in vitro synthesis of r proteins directed by DNA from transducing phage λfus3 and λrifd18. λfus3 carries genes for protein elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G, and RNA polymerase subunit α, in addition to genes for approximately 27 r proteins. λrifd18 carries genes for EF-Tu, RNA polymerase subunits β and βI, and a set of rRNAs, in addition to genes for approximately five r proteins. We have shown that low concentrations of ppGpp (0.2–0.3 mM) specifically inhibit DNA-dependent r protein synthesis in this system, and that this inhibition takes place directly, rather than as a consequence of the inhibition of rRNA synthesis by ppGpp. In addition, we have also shown that ppGpp inhibits the synthesis of EF-G, EF-Tu, and RNA polymerase subunit α, as well as rRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W1489928592,"NMR spectra of the downfield region of normal adult hemoglobin are reported as a function of oxygenation and temperature. Spectra were run in D2O at pD 7.4. A specially made NMR tube insert allowed precise measurement of the degree of oxygenation and of methemoglobin formation before and after taking the NMR spectrum. Plots of the estimated intensity of the most downfield prominent NMR peak, identified as arising from a deoxy-beta subunit by Davis et al. ((1971) J. Mol. Biol. 60, 101-111), versus the average degree of oxygenation y, measured optically, yield a nearly straight line within experimental error, for samples stripped of organic phosphates and for samples containing 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or inositol hexaphosphate. Intensities of peaks further upfield than this peak, previously attributed to deoxy-alpha subunits, are difficult to measure directly especially for samples containing inositol hexaphosphate. The latter samples show broadening in these alpha peaks as the degree of oxygenation increases. This extra broadening appears to increase with temperature. Linearity of the beta peak intensity with oxygenation is expected if there is no large oxygen affinity difference between alpha and beta subunits. However, the cooperativity of binding, and inaccuracy of the data, make it impossible to make accurate estimates of affinity differences."
https://openalex.org/W1541100234,"Membrane vesicles produced when chick erythroid cells are disrupted by nitrogen cavitation were isolated by centrifugation in a sucrose step gradient and purified on a linear sucrose gradient. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis of isolated membranes shows eight to ten proteins and four to five glycoproteins. Membranes must be prepared with protease inhibitors, otherwise an endogenous activity degrades high molecular weight polypeptide components. Red cells from several stages of development (5- and 17-day embryos and adult chickens) all appear to have the same major embrane proteins. However, primitive erythroid cells from 5-day embryos lack a Mr = 40,000 glycoprotein that is present in definitive erythrocytes from 17-day embryos and from adult chickens; erythrocytes from young chicks show a decrease in the amount of a glycoprotein of Mr = 50,000.

Other animals were not tested for retention at 4 days, but the tone was presented in order to reactivate their memories of the conditioning. An amnesia gradient was generated by low-intensity electrical stimulation of the amygdaloid complex at different intervals after the tone, but stimulation was without effect either when given to rats not previously conditioned or when given to conditioned rats without preceding memory reactivation. Thus, stimulation of the amygdaloid complex can affect memory retrieval. Moreover, the data call into question the assumption that an amnesia gradient indicates that the memory consolidation process has been modified."

https://openalex.org/W2056041769,"Murine intracisternal A particles have a number of properties which are common to known RNA tumor viruses, but horizontal transmission has not been previously demonstrated. The apparent absence of infectivity may be related to the failure of these particles to be released from cisternae of endo-plasmic reticulum. Previous biological studies using isolated, purified A particles have been compromised by the fact that the isolation procedure requires small amounts of nonionic detergent. Using some techniques of somatic cell hybridization, we have assessed the capacity for A particle genome transfer from positive to negative cells. Since it has been previously shown that some chloramphenicol-resistant cell lines can transfer this resistance in the cytoplasm, we have used this characteristic as a marker for cytoplasmic fragments. Mouse cells containing A particles were mutagenized, and clones resistant to chloramphenicol were selected; by enucleating these cells and fusing the resultant cytoplasts to each of two recipient mouse cell lines negative for A particles, it is possible to identify clones of cells known to be the product of a fusion event between a cytoplast and a whole cell (cybrids). Under these conditions, intracisternal A particles appear in the cybrid clones as a phenotypic trait that has not been segregated over at least 60-80 cell generations."
https://openalex.org/W1590872903,"Incubation of 5-iodo-5,6-dihydrouracil (IH2Ura) with soluble rat liver enzymes at 37 degrees, pH 8.2, results in the rapid release of iodide ion. The second product resulting from the carbon skeleton of the dihydropyrimidine ring system is 2-amino-2-oxazoline-5-carboxylic acid (I). Ultraviolet absorbance measurements at 225 nm, where both IH2Ura and iodide ion absorb, indicate that IH2Ura dehalogenation is a two-step process. The first step, which is enzyme-dependent, involves dihydropyrimidine amidohydrolase (EC 3.5.2.2.)-catalyzed hydrolysis of the IH2Ura ring system presumably to yield 2-iodo-3-ureidopropionate. The enzyme preparations also catalyze the hydrolysis of 5-bromo-5,6-dihydrouracil, 5,6-dihydrouracil, and 5,6-dihydrothymine, the latter two of which are the natural substrates for dihydropyrimidine amidohydrolase. The second step in IH2Ura dehalogenation involves the nonenzymatically catalyzed, pH-independent intramolecular cyclization of 2-iodo-3-ureidopropionate via nucleophilic attack of the ureido oxygen atom on carbon-2 resulting in iodide ion and the oxazoline (I) as final products.

https://openalex.org/W2069860957,A long-term suppression of a transplanted solid tumor that has been growing in a syngeneic animal can be achieved by the administration of antibody against the tumor. The susceptibility of such growing tumor cells to antibody treatment is similar to that of a comparable number of freshly injected tumor cells.

https://openalex.org/W1501023556,"The capacities of five hydrophobic peptides to bind 13 alkyl uracil derivatives have been assessed as a first step toward constructing polymeric molecules, related to the nucleic acids, that specifically complement protein molecules. The peptides were Phe-Phe-Phe-Glu-Glu and its structural analogs with leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and valine substituted for phenylalanine. Uracils with the following substituents in position 5' were used: i-propyl, i-butyl, i-pentyl, sec-butyl, n-butyl, phenyl, benzyl, phenylethyl, methylthioethyl, ethylthiomethyl, and ethylthioethyl. 6-Benzyl and 6-i-pentyl uracils were also tested. The variations in base binding patterns are unique for each peptide, and the general effectiveness of the peptides in binding is related to the order in which their hydrophobic amino acid constituents occur in the uracil column of the genetic codon table. Although the method used does not permit precise determination of binding constants, it is apparent that many of them are much lower than 1 mM. 5-Ethylthioethyluracil quite selectively forms a large metastable aggregate with Phe3Glu2. Its close homologues do not. Also, 5-ethylthioethyluracil binds in some measure to Met3Glu2 but not significantly to Ile3Glu2 and Val3Glu2, whereas its homologue, 5-ethylthiomethyluracil, binds better to the latter two than to Met3Glu2. Thus, the two homologues might serve to form hypothetical polymers that discriminatively bind polymers of isoleucine and valine. It is argued that evolution would most reasonably have begun with such crude mechanisms."

This glucose 6-phosphate is of endogenous origin via UDP-glucose and glucose 1-phosphate but not glucose. The accumulation is the result of inhibition of glycolysis by an effect of phospholipid on the interconversion of fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Brain is therefore capable of gluconeogenesis from fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. A regulatory function for phospholipid which coordinates glycolysis and other major routes of utilization of glucose 6-phosphate in brain, e.g. inositol synthesis, is proposed."
