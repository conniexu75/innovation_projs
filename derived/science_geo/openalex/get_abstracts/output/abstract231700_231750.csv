https://openalex.org/W2168062665,"Using inorganic carbon measurements from an international survey effort in the 1990s and a tracer-based separation technique, we estimate a global oceanic anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) sink for the period from 1800 to 1994 of 118 +/- 19 petagrams of carbon. The oceanic sink accounts for approximately 48% of the total fossil-fuel and cement-manufacturing emissions, implying that the terrestrial biosphere was a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere of about 39 +/- 28 petagrams of carbon for this period. The current fraction of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions stored in the ocean appears to be about one-third of the long-term potential."
https://openalex.org/W2068375361,"Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations over the past two centuries have led to greater CO 2 uptake by the oceans. This acidification process has changed the saturation state ofthe oceans with respect to calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) particles. Here we estimate the in situ CaCO 3 dissolution rates for the global oceans from total alkalinity and chlorofluorocarbon data, and we also discuss the future impacts of anthropogenic CO 2 on CaCO 3 shell–forming species. CaCO 3 dissolution rates, ranging from 0.003 to 1.2 micromoles per kilogram per year, are observed beginning near the aragonite saturation horizon. The total water column CaCO 3 dissolution rate for the global oceans is approximately 0.5 ± 0.2 petagrams of CaCO 3 -C per year, which is approximately 45 to 65% of the export production of CaCO 3 ."

https://openalex.org/W2092606584,Resistance to the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib (STI571 or Gleevec) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) occurs through selection for tumor cells harboring BCR-ABL kinase domain point mutations that interfere with drug binding. Crystallographic studies predict that most imatinib-resistant mutants should remain sensitive to inhibitors that bind ABL with less stringent conformational requirements. BMS-354825 is an orally bioavailable ABL kinase inhibitor with two-log increased potency relative to imatinib that retains activity against 14 of 15 imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. BMS-354825 prolongs survival of mice with BCR-ABL–driven disease and inhibits proliferation of BCR-ABL–positive bone marrow progenitor cells from patients with imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML. These data illustrate how molecular insight into kinase inhibitor resistance can guide the design of second-generation targeted therapies.

https://openalex.org/W2156423252,"Cytochromes P450 (P450s) metabolize a wide range of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics, such as pollutants, environmental compounds, and drug molecules. The microsomal, membrane-associated, P450 isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP1A2 are responsible for the oxidative metabolism of more than 90% of marketed drugs. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolizes more drug molecules than all other isoforms combined. Here we report three crystal structures of CYP3A4: unliganded, bound to the inhibitor metyrapone, and bound to the substrate progesterone. The structures revealed a surprisingly small active site, with little conformational change associated with the binding of either compound. An unexpected peripheral binding site is identified, located above a phenylalanine cluster, which may be involved in the initial recognition of substrates or allosteric effectors."

https://openalex.org/W2063006759,Interaction of regulatory DNA binding proteins with their target sites is usually preceded by binding to nonspecific DNA. This speeds up the search for the target site by several orders of magnitude. We report the solution structure and dynamics of the complex of a dimeric lac repressor DNA binding domain with nonspecific DNA. The same set of residues can switch roles from a purely electrostatic interaction with the DNA backbone in the nonspecific complex to a highly specific binding mode with the base pairs of the cognate operator sequence. The protein-DNA interface of the nonspecific complex is flexible on biologically relevant time scales that may assist in the rapid and efficient finding of the target site.

https://openalex.org/W1977007664,"Do blind people develop superior abilities in auditory perception to compensate for their lack of vision? They are known to be better than sighted people at orientating themselves by sound, but it is not clear whether this enhanced awareness extends to other auditory domains, such as listening to music or to voices. Here we show that blind people are better than sighted controls at judging the direction of pitch change between sounds, even when the speed of change is ten times faster than that perceived by the controls--but only if they became blind at an early age. The younger the onset of blindness, the better is the performance, which is in line with cerebral plasticity being optimal during the early years."
https://openalex.org/W2031289192,"Deciphering and understanding the small-scale magnetic activity of the quiet solar photosphere should help to solve many of the key problems of solar and stellar physics, such as the magnetic coupling to the outer atmosphere and the coronal heating. At present, we can see only approximately 1 per cent of the complex magnetism of the quiet Sun, which highlights the need to develop a reliable way to investigate the remaining 99 per cent. Here we report three-dimensional radiative transfer modelling of scattering polarization in atomic and molecular lines that indicates the presence of hidden, mixed-polarity fields on subresolution scales. Combining this modelling with recent observational data, we find a ubiquitous tangled magnetic field with an average strength of approximately 130 G, which is much stronger in the intergranular regions of solar surface convection than in the granular regions. So the average magnetic energy density in the quiet solar photosphere is at least two orders of magnitude greater than that derived from simplistic one-dimensional investigations, and sufficient to balance radiative energy losses from the solar chromosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2039235095,"We measured the spin state of iron in magnesium silicate perovskite (Mg(0.9),Fe(0.1))SiO(3) at high pressure and found two electronic transitions occurring at 70 gigapascals and at 120 gigapascals, corresponding to partial and full electron pairing in iron, respectively. The proportion of iron in the low spin state thus grows with depth, increasing the transparency of the mantle in the infrared region, with a maximum at pressures consistent with the D"" layer above the core-mantle boundary. The resulting increase in radiative thermal conductivity suggests the existence of nonconvecting layers in the lowermost mantle."

https://openalex.org/W2048400182,"During cytokinesis, furrow ingression and plasma membrane fission irreversibly separate daughter cells. How actomyosin ring assembly and contraction, vesicle fusion, and abscission are spatially coordinated was unknown. We found that during cytokinesis septin rings, located on both sides of the actomyosin ring, acted as barriers to compartmentalize the cortex around the cleavage site. Compartmentalization maintained diffusible cortical factors, such as the exocyst and the polarizome, to the site of cleavage. In turn, such factors were required for actomyosin ring function and membrane abscission. Thus, a specialized cortical compartment ensures the spatial coordination of cytokinetic events."

https://openalex.org/W1975440481,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between sexually unrelated species has recently been documented for higher plants, but mechanistic explanations for HGTs have remained speculative. We show that a parasitic relationship may facilitate HGT between flowering plants. The endophytic parasites Rafflesiaceae are placed in the diverse order Malpighiales. Our multigene phylogenetic analyses of Malpighiales show that mitochrodrial ( matR ) and nuclear loci (18 S ribosomal DNA and PHYC ) place Rafflesiaceae in Malpighiales, perhaps near Ochnaceae/Clusiaceae. Mitochondrial nad1B-C , however, groups them within Vitaceae, near their obligate host Tetrastigma . These discordant phylogenetic hypotheses strongly suggest that part of the mitochondrial genome in Rafflesiaceae was acquired via HGT from their hosts."

All of the Spaniard's Bay taxa were composed of similar architectural elements-centimeter-scale frondlets exhibiting three orders of fracticality in branching. Frondlets were combined as modules atop semi-rigid organic skeletons to form a wide array of larger constructions, including frondose and plumose structures. This architecture and construction define the ""rangeomorphs,"" a biological clade that dominated the Mistaken Point assemblage (575 to 560 million years ago) but does not appear to be ancestral to any Phanerozoic or modern organisms."

Less is known about changes in auditory sensitivity to those vocalizations. Here, we show that nonreproductive female midshipman fish treated with either testosterone or 17β-estradiol exhibit an increase in the degree of temporal encoding of the frequency content of male vocalizations by the inner ear that mimics the reproductive female's auditory phenotype. This sensory plasticity provides an adaptable mechanism that enhances coupling between sender and receiver in vocal communication."
https://openalex.org/W1980139700,"Experiments on imitation typically evaluate a student's ability to copy some feature of an expert's motor behavior. Here, we describe a type of observational learning in which a student copies a cognitive rule rather than a specific motor action. Two rhesus macaques were trained to respond, in a prescribed order, to different sets of photographs that were displayed on a touch-sensitive monitor. Because the position of the photographs varied randomly from trial to trial, sequences could not be learned by motor imitation. Both monkeys learned new sequences more rapidly after observing an expert execute those sequences than when they had to learn new sequences entirely by trial and error."

https://openalex.org/W1966551151,"Vertebrate limb outgrowth is driven by a positive feedback loop involving Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Gremlin, and Fgf4. By overexpressing individual components of the loop at a time after these genes are normally down-regulated in chicken embryos, we found that Shh no longer maintains Gremlin in the posterior limb. Shh-expressing cells and their descendants cannot express Gremlin. The proliferation of these descendants forms a barrier separating the Shh signal from Gremlin-expressing cells, which breaks down the Shh-Fgf4 loop and thereby affects limb size and provides a mechanism explaining regulative properties of the limb bud."

https://openalex.org/W1999037466,"Repair of chromosome breaks by non-homologous end joining requires the XRCC4-ligase IV complex, Ku, and the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). DNA-PKcs must also retain kinase activity and undergo autophosphorylation at six closely linked sites (ABCDE sites). We describe here an end-joining assay using only purified components that reflects cellular requirements for both Ku and kinase-active DNA-PKcs and investigate the mechanistic basis for these requirements. A need for DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation is sufficient to explain the requirement for kinase activity, in part because autophosphorylation is generally required for end-joining factors to access DNA ends. However, DNA-PKcs with all six ABCDE autophosphorylation sites mutated to alanine allows access to ends through autophosphorylation of other sites, yet our in vitro end-joining assay still reflects the defectiveness of this mutant in cellular end joining. In contrast, mutation of ABCDE sites to aspartate, a phosphorylation mimic, supports high levels of end joining that is now independent of kinase activity. This is likely because DNA-PKcs with aspartate substitutions at ABCDE sites allow access to DNA ends while retaining affinity for Ku-bound ends and stabilizing recruitment of the XRCC4-ligase IV complex. Autophosphorylation at ABCDE sites thus apparently directs a rearrangement of the DNA-PK complex that ensures access to broken ends and joining steps are coupled together within a synaptic complex, making repair more accurate.

The mammalian non-homologous end-joining pathway has an important role in all cell types for repair of double strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; LX, XRCC4-ligase IV complex; PKcs, protein kinase catalytic subunit; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase. caused by DNA damage (e.g. after ionizing radiation). End joining is also essential for efficient resolution of DSB intermediates in V(D)J recombination, a lymphocytespecific process required for assembly of the antigen-specific receptors of the immune system. Defective end joining thus results in radiation sensitivity, an increased incidence of cancer, and severe immunodeficiency (1Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Repair of broken ends by this pathway requires 1) recognition of broken ends and recruitment of end-joining factors, 2) alignment or synapsis of a pair of ends, and 3) processing by polymerases or nucleases as needed to generate compatible ends 4) followed by ligation. End joining uses the XRCC4-ligase IV complex (LX) for the ligation step (2Wilson T.E. Grawunder U. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 3Grawunder U.

The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) has been linked to early steps in end joining, and consists of the Ku heterodimer (Ku70 and Ku80) and a 460-kDa serine/threonine DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). Ku is required for end recognition and, once loaded on ends, acts as a scaffold for subsequent recruitment of DNA-PKcs (8Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar), the LX complex (9Nick McElhinny S.A. Snowden C.M. McCarville J. Ramsden D.A. Mol. Cell.

Several observations, including its ability to associate with Artemis and activate the endonuclease activity of Artemis (4Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), suggest a specific role for DNA-PKcs in directing end-processing events; however, DNA-PKcs deficiency affects cellular end joining even when processing is not required (see Ref. 12Bogue M.A. Jhappan C. Roth D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15559-15564Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and references therein). A more general role for DNA-PKcs in end joining is also consistent with in vitro evidence indicating that it helps Ku recruit the LX complex to ends (10Chen L. Trujillo K. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3192-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Together, these functions of DNA-PKcs may explain why LX activity is necessary in vitro when using substrates that do not require processing (10Chen L. Trujillo K. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26196-26205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 15Hanakahi L.A. Bartlet-Jones M. Chappell C. Pappin D. West S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 721-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that cellular end joining requires DNA-PKcs to undergo autophosphorylation (16Soubeyrand S. Pope L. Pakuts B. Hache R.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1198-1201PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Six autophosphorylation sites are clustered within a 40-amino acid region (“ABCDE” sites) (see Fig. 2A), although at least two other sites are also autophosphorylated (19Douglas P. Sapkota G.P. Morrice N. Yu Y. Goodarzi A.A. Merkle D. Meek K. Alessi D.R. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Individual mutation of ABCDE sites has mild or negligible effects, but a mutant with all six ABCDE sites converted to alanine (ABCDE(ala)) is unable to complement DNA-PKcs-deficient cells (17Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation in general had previously been shown in vitro to trigger a dissociation of DNA-PKcs from Ku-bound ends (20Merkle D. Douglas P. Moorhead G.B. Leonenko Z. Yu Y. Cramb D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12706-12714Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol.

Salles B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7848-7856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and probably end-joining factors as well (24Udayakumar D. Bladen C.L. Hudson F.Z. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41631-41635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Together, this evidence suggests that the cellular defects of the ABCDE(ala) mutant could simply be explained by its inability to be autophosphorylated and then dissociate, because its continued presence would prevent access to DNA ends by other end-joining factors. However, the purified ABCDE(ala) mutant protein also dissociates after autophosphorylation (17Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of sites outside of the ABCDE cluster is therefore sufficient for dissociation and end access, and the mechanism by which ABCDE autophosphorylation promotes end joining remains unclear. We therefore developed an in vitro assay using only purified Ku, DNA-PKcs, and the LX complex that reflects the cellular requirement for autophosphorylation at the ABCDE sites. We show that autophosphorylation at ABCDE sites uniquely makes ends accessible while still allowing DNA-PKcs to persist at ends and retain LX within a complex at ends. Proteins—Recombinant Ku heterodimer and LX were purified from baculovirus-infected cells as described previously (9Nick McElhinny S.A. Snowden C.M. McCarville J. Ramsden D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2996-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). DNA-PKcs was purified from 50 g of human placenta (“native” DNA-PKcs) or 5 liters of V3 cells stably expressing the various constructs (recombinant), also as described previously (17Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), with the following exception. Instead of using polyethyleneimine cellulose, nucleic acids were depleted by addition of polyethyleneimine to the extract to 0.2% v/v, centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and further clarification of the extract by the addition of phosphocellulose to 10% v/v and filtration. Approximate concentrations of proteins were calculated by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard, and quantitative Western analyses, used to confirm these estimates, were accurate within 20% when comparing different mutants. When indicated, kinase activity of DNA-PKcs was blocked by preincubation of a 100 nm protein stock with 10 μm wortmannin (Sigma) (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) for 10 min on ice; thus, assays typically contain less than 1 μm wortmannin and 1% dimethyl sulfoxide. All experiments compare activity of wortmannin-pretreated DNA-PKcs with mock-treated DNA-PKcs (i.e. pretreated in the same way with the appropriate amount of dimethyl sulfoxide). Assays—All reactions contained 25 mm TRIS-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 45 mm KCl, 105 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. End-joining assays used a 754-bp TaqI fragment of pUC18. Significant LX activity with this substrate required Ku as long as LX concentration was not in great excess over DNA ends. Additional requirement for DNA-PKcs was observed when the concentration of Ku also did not greatly exceed the concentration of DNA ends and when concentrations of all components, including DNA ends, were reduced. Reactions were supplemented with 10% polyethylene glycol (v/v) and, except as noted for Fig. 1C, preincubated with Ku and DNA-PKcs for 10 min at 25 °C before the addition of LX, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm ATP and transfer to 30 °C. Fig. 1C shows wortmannin (10 μm final concentration) added to reactions at the noted times during a 10-min preincubation, performed with MgCl2 and ATP but without LX. Reactions shown in Fig. 1C were then started by the addition of LX and transfer to 30 °C. All reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of a solution containing 25 mm TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and 1 mg/ml proteinase K, incubated at 55 °C for 1 h, and extracted with an equal volume of phenol and chloroform, before electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. Products were visualized by direct DNA staining with SYBR green (Sigma) and by Southern analysis using the 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide YR11 (5′-GCGTTTCGGTGATGACGGTGAAAAACCTCTG-3′) as a probe. The amount of product species was determined using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and ImagequaNT software. The 60-bp double-stranded DNA substrate used in electrophoretic mobility shift analysis assays has been described previously (9Nick McElhinny S.A. Snowden C.M. McCarville J. Ramsden D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2996-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Reactions were assembled in standard buffer and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before cross-linking with 0.06% glutaraldehyde. Fixing with glutaraldehyde was not required for detection of DNA-protein complexes, but this treatment reproducibly improved the definition of retarded species. Complexes were resolved on a 3.5% polyacrylamide gel in 90 mm TRIS borate, pH 8.2, and 1 mm EDTA (1× TBE) at 18 volts/cm. For exonuclease assays, we used the 754-bp TaqI substrate described above and 0.05 unit of exonuclease V (Amersham Biosciences). This concentration was determined by serial dilution of enzyme to be the minimum concentration of enzyme necessary to degrade ∼95% of the full-length substrate in 5 min in the absence of other added proteins. DNA-protein complexes were formed by preincubation at room temperature for 5 min, after which exonuclease V, 5 mm MgCl2, and 500 μm ATP were added. Reactions were then incubated at 30 °C before being stopped and deproteinized at the indicated times also as described for ligation assays. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, and products were visualized with SYBR green DNA stain (Sigma). Requirement for Kinase-active DNA-PK in in Vitro End Joining—We addressed the role of Ku and DNA-PKcs in in vitro end joining by the LX complex using a 754-bp linear duplex DNA substrate with 2-bp complementary overhangs. Both DNA-PK subunits are required for significant LX activity when using the conditions described here (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2–5; see also “Experimental Procedures”). Importantly, end joining is reduced more than 10-fold when the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs is blocked by pretreatment with wortmannin (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 5 and 6). We tested whether autophosphorylation of DNA-PK was sufficient to explain the requirement for kinase activity by separating the reaction into distinct autophosphorylation and ligation stages (Fig. 1B). DNA-PK was autophosphorylated to varying degrees in the first stage by addition of wortmannin at the beginning (Fig. 1C, lane 2, 0′ AutoP), after 2 min (Fig. 1C, lane 3, 2′ AutoP), or after 10 min (Fig. 1C, lane 5,10′ AutoP) of preincubation containing everything except LX. In the second stage, LX was added to assess how well autophosphorylated DNA-PKcs promoted end joining but now without concurrent kinase activity. As a standard for comparison, we allowed autophosphorylation and ligation to proceed in parallel (essentially as in Fig. 1A, lane 5) by omitting wortmannin and withholding ATP and Mg2+ until the addition of LX (Fig. 1C, lane 4). Importantly, 2 min of autophosphorylation was sufficient to make wild type DNA-PKcs independent of concurrent kinase activity in the end-joining assay (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 3 and 4). Autophosphorylation of DNA-PK is thus sufficient to explain the role of kinase activity in this assay, and autophosphorylation need not occur in parallel with end joining to be effective. More exhaustive autophosphorylation (10 min) still promoted significant end-joining activity, but levels were reduced ∼2-fold relative to the 2-min autophosphorylation (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 3 and 5). Therefore, although at least some autophosphorylation is required for end joining, the partial autophosphorylation achieved after 2 min is most effective. We next purified four DNA-PKcs variants with different mutations at sites of autophosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and B) and assessed their activity in this assay (Fig. 2C). Importantly, ligation activity relative to wild type DNA-PKcs is reduced 10-fold when using a mutant in which autophosphorylation of ABCDE serines and threonines is blocked by alanine substitutions (ABCDE(ala)) (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 3 and 5). Similar results were obtained with several independent preparations of ABCDE(ala) and also after prolonged incubation (Fig. 2C, lanes 8–10). Previously, a phosphorylation site outside the ABCDE cluster (serine 3205) was identified (19Douglas P. Sapkota G.P. Morrice N. Yu Y. Goodarzi A.A. Merkle D. Meek K. Alessi D.R. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Mutants of this site in conjunction with ABCDE sites (ABCDEF(ala)) also behave similarly to ABCDE(ala), both in cellular assays 2K. Meek and Q. Ding, unpublished data. and in vitro (Fig. 2C, lane 6). In contrast, mutation of single sites in the ABCDE cluster (A(ala), C(ala)) did not significantly reduce end joining in vitro (Fig. 2, lane 7), 3Y. V. R. Reddy and D. A. Ramsden, unpublished data. consistent with the near wild type ability of these mutants to promote radio resistance or V(D)J recombination in cells (17Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The requirements of this in vitro end-joining assay for autophosphorylation within ABCDE are, thus, identical to requirements previously revealed in cellular end-joining assays (17Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Role of ABCDE Autophosphorylation—Levels of end joining seen with the ABCDE(ala) mutant are similar to those seen when kinase activity of wild type DNA-PKcs is blocked, indicating that autophosphorylation of ABCDE sites is sufficient to explain the role of kinase activity in this assay. However, ABCDE(ala) is remarkably indistinguishable from wild type DNA-PKcs in most other respects. This mutant retains wild type levels of kinase activity as measured using p53 peptide, Artemis (17Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), or Ku as targets. 2K. Meek and Q. Ding, unpublished data. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis also indicates that ABCDE(ala) has wild type affinity for Ku-bound DNA ends (17Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 2 and 4), and the ability of ABCDE(ala) to promote recruitment of LX to DNA is equivalent to wild type DNA-PKcs (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 3 and 5). ABCDE(ala) does not dissociate as fully from Ku-bound ends as does wild type DNA-PKcs after autophosphorylation, but it does dissociate to some extent (17Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4). Autophosphorylation of sites outside the ABCDE cluster is thus largely sufficient for dissociation of DNA-PKcs. We used the ABCDE(ala) mutant and an exonuclease protection assay to determine whether autophosphorylation of sites outside the ABCDE cluster is sufficient to make DNA ends accessible (Fig. 4). Ku and wild type DNA-PKcs are both required to significantly delay digestion by exonuclease V. Even when both factors are present, linear duplex DNA is well protected only when the kinase is inactivated, consistent with previous studies indicating that autophosphorylation is required for exonucleases to access DNA ends (22Weterings E. Verkaik N.S. Bruggenwirth H.T. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Gent D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 7238-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Calsou P. Frit P. Humbert O. Muller C. Chen D.J. Salles B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7848-7856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, compare solid with dashed lines). Importantly, the ABCDE(ala) mutant is indistinguishable from wild type DNA-PKcs in this assay as well, because autophosphorylation of either protein leads to the parallel progressive digestion of substrate by exonuclease V (Fig. 4, compare squares with triangles). Wild type DNA-PKcs and ABCDE(ala) thus both allow access to ends on autophosphorylation, but only wild type DNA-PKcs supports high levels of joining by the LX complex. We conclude that simply providing access to ends does not explain why autophosphorylation at ABCDE sites is so critical for cellular end joining. We suggest instead that ABCDE autophosphorylation may be essential for end-joining activity because it might confer end accessibility, while still allowing DNA-PKcs to remain associated. Persistence of DNA-PKcs at ends would allow it to continue promoting synapsis of ends and stabilizing recruitment of LX, thus enabling LX to take advantage of end synapsis. This hypothesis predicts that DNA-PKcs autophosphorylated only within ABCDE sites should allow access to ends but retain the ability to form a complex with end-joining factors. To test these predictions, we modeled a DNA-PKcs molecule in which autophosphorylation is restricted to ABCDE sites by using a mutant with aspartates (a phosphorylation mimic) substituted at ABCDE sites instead of alanines. In the presence of ABCDE(asp), ends are sensitive to exonuclease digestion even when kinase activity is blocked by wortmannin (Fig. 4), suggesting that autophosphorylation restricted to ABCDE is sufficient for end access. ABCDE(asp) nevertheless still forms a complex with Ku at DNA ends, although roughly one-third as well as wild type DNA-PKcs (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 4 and 6). ABCDE(asp) retains kinase activity (17Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and autophosphorylation of this mutant at sites outside the ABCDE cluster is required for complete dissociation (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 5 and 6), as argued previously (17Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) from the study of the ABCDE(ala) mutant. More significantly, ABCDE(asp) still promotes recruitment of the LX complex (Fig. 3B, compare lane 1 with lanes 7 and 8). DNA-PKcs autophosphorylated only within ABCDE thus permits access to ends, maintains affinity for Ku-bound ends, and helps retain LX at ends. We have shown that at least partial autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs within ABCDE sites is essential for end-joining activity (Figs. 1 and 2), but the experiments described above suggest it may also be sufficient (i.e. autophosphorylation outside ABCDE may be dispensable for end-joining activity in this context). We addressed this possibility by assessing whether ABCDE(asp) was active in the end-joining assay, even when kinase activity was blocked by wortmannin treatment. ABCDE(asp) was only 2-fold less effective than wild type DNA-PKcs in promoting end joining, in contrast to ABCDE(ala) (Fig. 5, compare lanes 2 and 4). More importantly, the ability of wild type DNA-PKcs to support end joining requires kinase activity, but ABCDE(asp) does not (Fig. 5, compare lanes 4 and 5). This argues that autophosphorylation within ABCDE is both necessary and sufficient for activity of LX in vitro. We have developed an in vitro end-joining assay using only purified Ku, DNA-PKcs, and LX. These are the factors required for non-homologous end joining in cells, so that our assay reflects the cellular end-joining process. Furthermore, our system depends on the ability of DNA-PKcs to undergo autophosphorylation at ABCDE sites in exact parallel to the situation in vivo. Our results using this assay indicate that ABCDE autophosphorylation leads to a destabilization of DNA-PK that is critical for significant end-joining activity. By comparison, autophosphorylation outside the ABCDE cluster has a similar impact on DNA-PK complex stability but does not support end joining. We therefore propose that autophosphorylation within ABCDE is uniquely able to direct a rearrangement of the DNA-PK complex at DNA ends that is essential for end joining both in vitro and in cells. This requirement offers important advantages to the end joining repair pathway because it ensures the seamless coupling of each step in end joining to the next as described below (Fig. 6). Ku and DNA-PKcs initially recruit LX and other end-joining factors to DNA ends, but ends remain inaccessible even to factors within this complex when autophosphorylation is blocked (Fig. 1A) (22Weterings E. Verkaik N.S. Bruggenwirth H.T. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Gent D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 7238-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Calsou P. Frit P. Humbert O. Muller C. Chen D.J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 41631-41635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation (and kinase activity in general) is stimulated when ends are brought together (synapsis) (Fig. 6, step 2) (14DeFazio L.G. Stansel R.M. Griffith J.D. Chu G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3192-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 22Weterings E. Verkaik N.S. Bruggenwirth H.T. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Gent D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 7238-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation thus links end accessibility to synapsis, helping to ensure that only enzymes specific to this pathway, and thus already present within the synaptic complex, can act on ends. The ABCDE(asp) mutant uncouples accessibility from synapsis. This “partially autophosphorylated” DNA-PKcs has only intermediate levels of end joining relative to wild type and the ABCDE(ala) mutant, both in vitro and in cellular assays (17Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, reduced effectiveness of the ABCDE(asp) mutant is particularly evident in cells, probably reflective of the greater risk posed by indiscriminate end accessibility in a cellular environment. Once the kinase is activated, autophosphorylation occurs both within the ABCDE cluster and at other sites that are currently being characterized. Our data indicate that ABCDE and other sites are autophosphorylated independently, and either set of autophosphorylations alone is sufficient to make ends accessible (Fig. 4). Therefore, we argue that the primary problem with cells expressing the ABCDE(ala) mutant is not that this mutant blocks the ability of processing factors to access ends. In support of this argument, hairpin intermediates in V(D)J recombination are opened (processed) with similar efficiency in cells expressing either wild type DNA-PKcs or the ABCDE(ala) mutant, but these processed intermediates are not joined in cells expressing ABCDE(ala) (17Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ABCDE(ala) mutant is also unable to promote wild type levels of signal end joining in cells, a reaction that does not require processing (17Ding Q. Reddy Y.V. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The primary problem with end joining in cells expressing ABCDE(ala) must therefore be that they are unable to couple synapsis with end access and LX activity (and probably the activity of other end-joining factors as well). This is presumably because ABCDE autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs is uniquely able to combine end accessibility with its retention at ends (Fig. 6, step 3). Although bound to ends in this manner, DNA-PKcs can continue fulfilling its role in promoting end synapsis and the stable recruitment of LX until repair is complete. Autophosphorylation restricted to either ABCDE sites or outside sites has an equivalent impact on how well DNA-PKcs interacts with Ku-bound DNA ends (Fig. 3A, compare lane 2 with lanes 3 and 6). However, our data suggest that autophosphorylation within ABCDE allows access to ends prior to DNA-PKcs dissociation, whereas autophosphorylation of outside sites permits access only when a sufficient number of sites have been phosphorylated so that DNA-PKcs dissociates. This suggests a clear mechanistic difference in how the two types of autophosphorylation affect DNA interactions. It is likely that ABCDE autophosphorylation alters the DNA-PK complex by limiting its impact on the DNA binding activity of DNA-PKcs to the specific disruption of interactions involved in end protection (Fig. 6, step 3). In contrast, autophosphorylation at sites outside the ABCDE cluster might disrupt an alternate DNA-binding site not involved in end protection or indirectly impact DNA binding by disrupting interactions with Ku. Consistent with the former idea, biochemistry and electron microscopy support a two-site model for DNA-PKcs interaction with DNA, in which one site interacts with DNA ends, whereas the other independently interacts with the DNA backbone, 15–20 bp removed from the end (25Boskovic J. Rivera-Calzada A. Maman J.D. Chacon P. Willison K.R. Pearl L.H. Llorca O. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5875-5882Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Continued autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs leads to a progressive reduction in DNA-binding activity and eventually complete dissociation (Fig. 6, step 4) (20Merkle D. Douglas P. Moorhead G.B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This may be required for processing events that require a greater degree of access to ends than does ligation. More likely, because DNA-PKcs has a role in stabilizing recruitment of LX (Fig. 3B) (10Chen L. Trujillo K. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26196-26205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 13Calsou P. Delteil C. Frit P. Drouet J. Salles B. J. Mol.

Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), and likely other factors as well, dissociation of DNA-PKcs may trigger the general disassembly of the entire end-joining complex, with the possible exception of Ku. Disassembly of the end-joining complex could be important in making the successfully repaired junction accessible for subsequent transactions (e.g. transcription and replication). Alternatively, the eventual disassembly of end-joining factors from breaks when repair fails may help cells by making these breaks accessible to other repair pathways. The latter argument is suggested by the ability of a specific inhibitor of DNA-PKcs kinase activity to disrupt homologous recombination-dependent repair of DSBs (26Allen C. Halbrook J. Nickoloff J.A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 913-920PubMed Google Scholar). DSBs can still be repaired by end joining in the absence of DNA-PK (Ku and DNA-PKcs), but this “backup” pathway is less accurate (27Liang F.

We suggest that a major reason for this is the ability of ABCDE autophosphorylation to ensure that once ends have been recognized by DNA-PK only the factors appropriate to this pathway, and thus present with DNA-PK in the synaptic complex, can be employed productively. On the other hand, processing events that are not coupled to synapsis will be blocked, explaining how DNA-PK makes end joining more accurate. We thank Stephanie Nick McElhinny, Bernard E. Weissman, Tania Paull, and Martin Gellert for critical reading of the manuscript and members of the Ramsden laboratory for helpful discussion."

N. meningitidis is the causative agent of meningococcal meningitis and septicemia. In common with many other Gram-negative pathogens, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it constitutively produces long, thin fibers, termed type IV pili (Tfp) 1The abbreviations used are: Tfp, type IV pili/pilus; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; FSC, Fourier shell correlation. (1Tønjum T. Koomey M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The expression of Tfp is vital to the pathogenicity of these organisms, and they play a pivotal role in cellular adhesion to host epithelial cells. Neisseria also utilizes Tfp in several diverse processes, including cellular agglutination (2Park H.S.M. Wolfgang M. Koomey M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3891-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), twitching motility (3Wolfgang M. Park H.S.M. Hayes S.F. van Putten J.P.M. Koomey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Microbiol. 2002; 46: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Tfp are composed predominantly of a helical polymer of the pilin subunit PilE; a model for the helix with five pilin subunits/turn has been proposed based on the crystal structure of PilE (5Parge H.E. Forest K.T. Hickey M.J. Christensen D.A. Getzoff E.D. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Tfp are dynamic structures, capable of rapid extension as well as retraction and can be subjected to substantial motor forces in the region of 100 piconewtons (6Maier B. Potter L. So M. Seifert H.S. Sheetz M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16012-16017Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The Tfp biogenesis system can therefore be thought of as a highly sophisticated molecular machine, capable of working in two opposite directions. Formation of Tfp is a complex process that involves at least 12 different proteins, but PilQ is the only protein component that is an integral outer membrane protein. Expression of the PilQ complex is mandatory for Tfp formation, and inactivation of the pilQ gene in Neisseria sp. leads to a non-piliated phenotype (7Tønjum T. Caugant D.A. Dunham S.A. Koomey M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8Drake S.L. Koomey M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). PilQ is a member of a family of outer membrane proteins termed secretins, which are involved in secretion of a variety of substrates from Gram-negative bacteria. There is a significant level of sequence homology between the C-terminal regions of the PilQ monomer and the Klebsiella oxytoca PulD secretin involved in the type II secretion system (9Nouwen N. Ranson N. Saibil H. Wolpensinger B. Engel A. Ghazi A. Pugsley A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8173-8177Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and the pIV protein, which plays a vital role in assembly of filamentous bacteriophage (10Opalka N. Beckmannn R. Boisset N. Simon M.N. Russel M. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This observation has led to suggestions that the secretins may function in a similar way, by forming a passage through the outer membrane for the secreted substrate. Purification and subsequent studies by electron microscopy of PulD, pIV, and PilQ have shown that they form high molecular mass complexes (9Nouwen N. Ranson N. Saibil H. Wolpensinger B. Engel A.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in negative stain show ring-like structures in projection with a central stained feature, interpreted as a cavity, measuring up to 75 Å in diameter. This observation has lent weight to the hypothesis that the secretins act as a conduit for passage of the secreted substrate. There is also evidence from studies of reconstituted PulD that the channel formed by the secretin is gated, suggesting that the pore formation is regulated (9Nouwen N. Ranson N. Saibil H. Wolpensinger B. Engel A. Ghazi A. Pugsley A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8173-8177Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The K. oxytoca PulD oligomer was shown to exhibit C12 rotational symmetry, and a three-dimensional model of the structure of the complex produced from face-on and side-on views of the complex has been presented. The structure is composed of a central channel with a minimum diameter of 70 Å, enclosed by a cylindrical protein complex with radial spokes. More recent work on the pIV protein complex used cryoelectron microscopy to produce a full three-dimensional structure of the secretin at 22 Å resolution (10Opalka N. Beckmannn R. Boisset N. Simon M.N. Russel M. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this structure had C14 (rather than C12) symmetry and appears to have a blockage in the central pore. Visualized under negative stain TEM, preparations of purified PilQ have a doughnut-like appearance with an apparent cavity ∼60 Å in diameter (12Collins R.F. Davidsen L. Derrick J.P. Ford R.C. Tønjum T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3825-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Further analysis by single particle averaging methods suggested that the complex has C12 symmetry, and a three-dimensional reconstruction from a sample in negative stain at 25 Å resolution shows a bowl-like structure (11Collins R.F. Ford R.C. Kitmitto A. Olsen R. Tønjum T. Derrick J.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To obtain more detailed structural information on the PilQ complex, we have applied cryo-negative staining in conjunction with single particle averaging methods to extend the resolution of the structure considerably to 12 Å. These data are complemented by supporting results obtained from analysis of two-dimensional crystals of the reconstituted PilQ complex. The PilQ characterization at 12 Å resolution is the highest level of structural detail yet obtained for a protein from the secretin family; the results are not easily reconciled with a model for PilQ as a passive sheath within the outer membrane and suggest that the protein could play an active role in pilus assembly or modification.

The oligomeric PilQ secretin complex was isolated from meningococcal cells using the Zwittergent 3-10 purification procedure described previously (11Collins R.F. Ford R.C. Kitmitto A. Olsen R. Tønjum T. Derrick J.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The efficiency of membrane solubilization and subsequent yields of PilQ were increased using capsule polysaccharide-deficient bacteria. PilQ-containing fractions were selected by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified N. meningitidis PilQ complex from strain M1080 (7Tønjum T. Caugant D.A. Dunham S.A. Koomey M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The conditions used to verify PilQ sample purity by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies against PilE, PilP, PilC, and lipopolysaccharide have been described previously (7Tønjum T. Caugant D.A. Dunham S.A. Koomey M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cryo-negative Staining—Variations on previously reported methods (13Adrian M. Dubochet J. Fuller S.D. Harris J.R. Micron. 1998; 29: 145-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) were used to prepare PilQ samples for cryoelectron microscopy. This method involves suspending the protein in a thin solution containing trehalose with 5-10% (w/v) ammonium molybdate and then recording data under low temperature conditions. The use of low temperature preserves the sample in a hydrated condition, and the addition of molybdate provides a significant gain in contrast enhancement of the sample over more traditional cryological methods. 20 μl of PilQ (100 μg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (w/v) Zwittergent 3-10) were mixed with 20 μl of freshly prepared 5-10% (w/v) ammonium molybdate containing 1% (w/v) trehalose. Carbon-coated copper grids or holey carbon grids (No. 400) were placed on the surface of the droplet for several seconds, briefly blotted, and immediately frozen in liquid N2 to ∼100 K in an Oxford System cryo-stage. Preparation of PilQ in this fashion routinely suspended PilQ particles in a layer of stain/cryoprotectant ∼300-500 Å thick.

Open table in a new tab Two-dimensional Crystallization of PilQ and Crystal Analysis—Two-dimensional crystals of oligomeric PilQ were obtained by reconstitution into lipid bilayers. 50 μl of PilQ (100 μg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (w/v) Zwittergent 3-10) were mixed with 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine to provide a final protein/lipid ratio of 10:1. Hydrophobic polystyrene beads, or Bio-Beads, have been shown to provide a surface for nonspecific adsorption of detergent and are a convenient method for detergent extraction (14Rigaud J.L. Mosser G. Lacapere J.J. Olofsson A. Levy D. Ranck J.L. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Hydrated SM2 Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad) were added to the PilQ/1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine solution, and the mixture was incubated at 20 °C for 24-48 h. Large two-dimensional crystal sheets of PilQ were formed at the air-water interface of the solution; the crystals were examined using TEM by gently applying glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids to the surface of the solution, followed by negative staining with 4% (w/v) uranyl acetate as described previously (11Collins R.F. Ford R.C. Kitmitto A. Olsen R. Tønjum T. Derrick J.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). TEM was then performed under low dose conditions on a Tecnai 10 transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Images were recorded on Kodak SO-163 film and digitized on a UMAX Power Look 3000 densitometer at 4.81 Å/pixel at the specimen level. Lattice unbending and contrast transfer function corrections were applied as described (15Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) using the MRC-LMB software suite (16Amos L.A. Henderson R. Unwin P.N.T. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1982; 39: 183-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 17Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Projection maps were generated using CCP4 software (18P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional Structure Calculation—The three-dimensional volume of PilQ was calculated using common lines projection matching methods employed in EMAN (19Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar). EMAN requires a preliminary model to calculate a three-dimensional structure and then implements a model-based iterative refinement process to generate the final structure. To generate the preliminary model, a series of reference-free class averages corresponding to different views of the top and sides of a particle must first be generated from the data set. An initial data set of 7588 PilQ particles was interactively selected using the graphics interfaces of either SPIDER (WEB) (20Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar) or EMAN (BOXER) (19Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar). The contrast transfer function for each particle in the data set was determined, and a correction was applied (21Wang M.C. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Kitmitto A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Data were then converted into a format suitable for EMAN with contrast normalization applied. The selected particles were band pass-filtered to 8 Å and centered, and a set of reference-free class averages corresponding to a range of particle orientations was generated. Following established procedures in the EMAN software suite, a preliminary three-dimensional model was determined from class averages that represented distinct views of the PilQ particle. Volumes were then separately calculated with either C1, C4, or C12 symmetry applied. The relative orientations of the characteristic views were determined using a Fourier common lines routine, and the averages were combined to generate the preliminary three-dimensional model, the starting point for the main refinement loop. The class averages generated in the refinement loop were produced by a projection matching routine, whereby projections with uniformly distributed orientations of the preliminary three-dimensional model were used as references for classification of the raw data set, with the class averages from this step used to construct a new three-dimensional model. This is an iterative procedure with convergence assessed by examining the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of the three-dimensional models generated from each iteration. The final three-dimensional volume with C4 symmetry applied was fully converged after six rounds of iterative refinement. To assess that the correct structure had converged, several different starting models were used. For a C4 symmetry reconstruction, the EMAN starting model is automatically determined from the top and side views, whereas for C1, these views must be selected by the user; in both cases, equivalent structures were generated regardless of the starting model. As an additional check, an unsymmetrized three-dimensional volume, previously calculated from a separate data set (11Collins R.F. Ford R.C. Kitmitto A. Olsen R. Tønjum T. Derrick J.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), was used as a starting model and produced a similar convergence. Symmetry Analysis of PilQ—Rotational symmetry in volumes was initially assessed in EMAN using STARTCSYM and independently validated in SPIDER (20Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar) using a variation on rotational power methods (22Crowther R.A. Amos L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 23Kocsis E. Cerritelli M.E. Trus B.L. Cheng N. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1995; 60: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For the real space three-dimensional correlation rotation analyses, the volumes obtained with C1 or C4 symmetry applied were rotated around the central symmetry axis by a specified angle using the program MAPROT (24Stein P.E. Boodhoo A. Armstrong G.D. Cockle S.A. Klein M.H. Read R.J. Structure. 1994; 2: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and the density map correlation coefficient was calculated using OVERLAPMAP (25Branden C.I. Jones T.A. Nature. 1990; 343: 687-689Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar), both from the CCP4 suite (18P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Resolution Determination and Calculation of Variance Maps—Resolution was determined by FSC analysis by comparing the correspondence in reciprocal space of two subaverages generated from half of the final data set (i.e. 3794 particles) (20Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). Using the same subvolumes, a variance map for the final three-dimensional structure was calculated to reveal regions of the structure with a high degree of flexibility. Data Collection and Single Particle Classification—A previous electron microscopy study on the PilQ oligomer was performed at room temperature on air-dried protein samples that had been negatively stained with uranyl acetate (11Collins R.F. Ford R.C. Kitmitto A. Olsen R. Tønjum T. Derrick J.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure generated from these data, using the random conical tilt method, was limited to 25 Å resolution. Under these conditions, the PilQ oligomer adopted a preferential orientation with respect to the carbon support film and presented a toroidal appearance in projection. In this study, we used the relatively new technique of cryo-negative staining to extend the resolution and detail of the molecular envelope (13Adrian M. Dubochet J. Fuller S.D. Harris J.R. Micron. 1998; 29: 145-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This method provided several advantages over data collected previously with negatively stained PilQ recorded at ambient temperatures. Cryo-negatively stained PilQ particles adopted previously unobserved multiple orientations within the staining layer (Fig. 1A). The distinctive high contrast ring-shaped structures were readily identified, but additional projection profiles could also be observed. The views corresponded to the PilQ complex orientated in different directions from those observed previously (Figs. 1A and 2). This combination of multiple views of the PilQ complex with good signal/noise ratio allowed us to implement the Fourier common lines projection matching method (19Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar) to determine the PilQ complex three-dimensional structure. Fig. 1B illustrates the Fourier transform calculated from the cryo-negatively stained PilQ micrograph in Fig. 1A, showing concentric Thon rings reaching beyond 8 Å resolution. In principle, it is reasonable to anticipate a three-dimensional structure determination to ∼13 Å resolution or better, if a sufficiently large and accurately aligned data set can be obtained.Fig. 2PilQ particle selection and classification. Shown is a montage of representative PilQ particles (60-pixel mask) present in three of the different orientation classes. The resulting two-dimensional class averages for each of the particle classes following alignment are shown with the corresponding two-dimensional back-projections from the preliminary three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction with C4 symmetry imposed. Averages were calculated using the software package EMAN (19Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar). Scale bar = 100 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 2 shows a selection of contrast-enhanced PilQ particles with contrast transfer function correction applied. Examples are shown of reference-free class averages that were obtained when the raw data were aligned and are representative of the range of multiple orientations sampled. The “top” view of the PilQ complex, which displayed the highest Cn rotational symmetry, has a distinctively square appearance in projection, and consequently, it was readily distinguished from partial top and side views. A small amount of positive density is apparent in the center of the projection, probably originating from the cap feature (see Fig. 6). The PilQ complex has a maximum diameter of 145 Å when viewed from this orientation, slightly smaller than the equivalent dimension (∼160 Å) derived from PilQ samples stained with uranyl acetate. This is most probably due to the fact that conventional negative stain often produces some sample flattening during drying (11Collins R.F. Ford R.C. Kitmitto A. Olsen R. Tønjum T. Derrick J.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Collins R.F. Davidsen L. Derrick J.P. Ford R.C. Tønjum T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3825-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The majority of the data consisted of particles in intermediate orientations between the top and side views; an example is shown in Fig. 2 (middle panels). Particles with this type of orientation often had a slightly elliptical or flattened ring appearance. Examples of side views are shown in Fig. 2 (lower panels). For the side orientation, the central cavity of the complex still forms a high contrast feature, but the projection is more conical in appearance, with a rounded base. The side view has three distinct bands running across the projection, a feature that is shared by the PulD and pIV secretins (9Nouwen N. Ranson N. Saibil H. Wolpensinger B. Engel A. Ghazi A. Pugsley A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8173-8177Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 10Opalka N. Beckmannn R. Boisset N. Simon M.N. Russel M. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Rotational Symmetry of Oligomeric PilQ—A three-dimensional volume for the PilQ complex was initially calculated using common lines projection matching methods employed in EMAN (19Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar), assuming no rotational symmetry (i.e. C1). The three-dimensional volume was then examined for rotational symmetry by calculation of the map correlation coefficient (25Branden C.I. Jones T.A. Nature. 1990; 343: 687-689Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar) as a function of the angle of rotation about the main axis through the middle of the PilQ complex (Fig. 3). The results provide clear evidence for 4-fold rotational symmetry, with peaks of approximately equal height at 90°, 180°, and 270°. This conclusion was confirmed by calculation of two-dimensional class average projection maps of the unsymmetrized complex along the long axis of rotational symmetry and determination of the angular cross-correlation for each rotational symmetry (C1-C14) in Fourier space (data not shown) (26Frank J. Three-dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996Crossref Google Scholar). The pronounced 4-fold rotational symmetry was also readily apparent from the square-shaped projections of individual particles when viewed from the top (Fig. 2). There was an excellent correlation between the example class averages where C4 symmetry had been applied and those without any rotational symmetry imposed. This correlation was not apparent when other higher rotational symmetries were applied (data not shown). This observation confirms that the application of C4 symmetry in the processing of the data does not introduce features that were not present in the unsymmetrized data set. The data set was also analyzed for possible D symmetry, but none was found. Analysis of Two-dimensional Crystals of the Reconstituted PilQ Complex—Previous work on PilQ (11Collins R.F. Ford R.C. Kitmitto A. Olsen R. Tønjum T. Derrick J.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and other related secretins (9Nouwen N. Ranson N. Saibil H. Wolpensinger B.

Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) has provided evidence for 12- and 14-fold rotational symmetries in these complexes. To establish unambiguously that C4 symmetry is appropriate, two-dimensional crystals of PilQ were obtained by reconstitution of the protein into lipid membranes (Fig. 4A). Mixtures of the detergent-solubilized PilQ complex and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine at a high protein/lipid ratio were incubated with Bio-Beads, resulting in the formation of very large two-dimensional crystalline membrane sheets (>5-μm diameter). Analysis of Fourier transforms from these two-dimensional crystal membrane sheets revealed that they consisted of two overlapping crystalline layers. The better stained lower layer was deconvoluted from the upper layer, and two-dimensional crystal analysis was performed by selecting small, well ordered areas. Examination of the two-dimensional crystals revealed that the tightly packed lattice was composed of square particles, with one PilQ oligomer present in the unit cell (a = 146 Å, b = 146 Å, γ = 90°).

https://openalex.org/W2004823493,"The Ssn6-Tup1 corepressor complex regulates many genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Three mechanisms have been proposed to explain its repression functions: 1) nucleosome positioning by binding histone tails; 2) recruitment of histone deacetylases; and 3) direct interference with the general transcription machinery or activators. It is unclear if Ssn6-Tup1 utilizes each of these mechanisms at a single gene in a redundant manner or each individually at different loci. A systematic analysis of the contribution of each mechanism at a native promoter has not been reported. Here we employed a genetic strategy to analyze the contributions of nucleosome positioning, histone deacetylation, and Mediator interference in the repression of chromosomal Tup1 target genes in vivo. We exploited the fact that Ssn6-Tup1 requires the ISW2 chromatin remodeling complex to establish nucleosome positioning in vivo to disrupt chromatin structure without affecting other Tup1 repression functions. Deleting ISW2, the histone deacetylase gene HDA1, or genes encoding Mediator subunits individually caused slight or no derepression of RNR3 and HUG1. However, when Mediator mutations were combined with Δisw2 or Δhda1 mutations, enhanced transcription was observed, and the strongest level of derepression was observed in triple Δisw2/Δhda1/Mediator mutants. The increased transcription in the mutants was not due to the loss of Tup1 at the promoter and correlated with increased TBP cross-linking to promoters. Thus, Tup1 utilizes multiple redundant mechanisms to repress transcription of native genes, which may be important for it to act as a global corepressor at a wide variety of promoters.

Thus, Tup1 utilizes multiple redundant mechanisms to repress transcription of native genes, which may be important for it to act as a global corepressor at a wide variety of promoters. The Ssn6-Tup1 complex represses more than 180 genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae controlled by different pathways (1DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3690) Google Scholar) and is, thus, considered a global corepressor of transcription. It does not directly bind to DNA, but is targeted to promoters by sequence-specific DNA binding repressors (for review see Ref. 2Smith R.L. Johnson A.D. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Although Ssn6 and Tup1 form a complex, it is largely accepted that Tup1 contributes the bulk of the repression activity and Ssn6 acts as an adaptor. Recruitment of Ssn6 to promoter via the LexA DNA binding domain can repress transcription of a reporter plasmid in a Tup1-dependent manner, while repression by LexA-Tup1 is independent of Ssn6 (3Keleher C.A.

Furthermore, overexpression of TUP1 can partially suppress the mating defect of a Δssn6/Δtup1 double mutant, whereas overexpression of SSN6 cannot (6Komachi K. Redd M.J. Johnson A.D.

Furthermore, the repression domain of Tup1 can directly bind hypoacetylated histone H3 and H4 tails (15Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), and H3 and H4 tails are required for repression of Tup1-dependent genes (15Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y.

At the mating type-specific gene STE6, Tup1 was shown to cross-link throughout the entire gene, and two Tup1 molecules per nucleosome were incorporated into the repressive chromatin structure of a minichromosome (17Ducker C.E.

A recent paper showed that a triple Δrpd3/Δhos1/Δhos2 mutant has increased histone acetylation and reduced cross-linking of Tup1 to promoters (19Davie J.K. Trumbly R.J. Dent S.Y.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus HDAC recruitment may form a positive feedback loop in establishing and expanding a repressive chromatin domain: to repress transcription locally upon recruitment by Ssn6-Tup1 and facilitate the spreading of Tup1 into adjacent regions. In addition to the chromatin-dependent repression mechanisms described above, Ssn6-Tup1 can also function by blocking activators and interfering with the transcription machinery (2Smith R.L.

Even in combination, Mediator Srb8–10 mutations caused no defect in the repression of multiple native Tup1-dependent genes, and the combination of Mediator mutations with histone tail mutations did not affect repression of ANB1 (31Lee M.

The RNR3 gene encodes for the large subunit of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which plays a crucial role in DNA replication and repair. RNR3 and the other RNR genes (RNR1, 2, and 4) are under the tight control of the Ssn6-Tup1 complex (13Li B. Reese J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33788-33797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Genetics. 1992; 131: 851-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Li B. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4091-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The corepressor complex is recruited to the RNR genes by the sequence-specific DNA-binding protein Crt1, which recognizes the DNA damage response elements (DREs) in the upstream repression sequence (URS) (19Davie J.K. Trumbly R.J. Dent S.Y.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 35Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Crt1 interacts with Ssn6-Tup1 in vitro and recruits it to promoters in the absence of DNA damage, and the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway causes the release of Crt1 and Tup1 from the promoter (14Zhang Z. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes are precisely positioned over RNR3 in the repressed state, and inducing the cell with the DNA-damaging agent MMS causes the release Crt1-Ssn6-Tup1 from the URS and chromatin remodeling, suggesting a role for chromatin structure in RNR3 gene regulation (13Li B.

Likewise, deleting CRT1, SSN6, or TUP1 disrupts the nucleosome array over RNR3 (13Li B. Reese J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33788-33797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14Zhang Z. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recent work from our laboratory suggested that nucleosome positioning by Ssn6-Tup1 requires the chromatin remodeling/nucleosome spacing complex ISW2. Deleting the gene coding for the catalytic subunit of the ISW2 complex, ISW2, disrupts nucleosome positioning without causing significant transcription derepression of the DNA damage-inducible RNR3 or stress-inducible ENA1 genes (14Zhang Z. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), suggesting that pathways in addition to nucleosome positioning repress Tup1-regulated genes. In this study, we used DNA damage-inducible genes as our primary models to analyze systematically the contribution of each Ssn6-Tup1 repression mechanism in transcriptional regulation. We find that Tup1 utilizes multiple redundant mechanisms to repress transcription, which include nucleosome positioning, histone deacetylation, and Mediator interference. We propose that Ssn6-Tup1 has developed multiple mechanisms to function as a “global” corepressor, and different groups of genes have developed different strategies to utilize Ssn6-Tup1 in repression.

In all cases, cells were grown in 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 20 μg/ml adenine sulfate, and 2% dextrose (YPAD) at 30 °C.

Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). 10–15 ml of yeast cell grown in YPAD, treated or untreated with MMS, were harvested by centrifugation, washed with STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), and resuspended in RNA preparation buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl). RNA was released by glass bead disruption in the presence of 150 μl of phenol/chloroform, extracted once more with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. RNA concentration was then quantified by measuring its absorption at 260 nm. 20 μg of total RNA was separated on 1% (1.6% for ANB1 analysis) formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary blotting. After UV-cross-linking and 4-h prehybridization at 65 °C, radioactively labeled gene-specific probes were added. Micrococcal Nuclease Mapping—Nuclei preparation was carried out essentially as described previously (13Li B. Reese J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33788-33797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 38Ryan M.P. Stafford G.A. Yu L. Cummings K.B. Morse R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 376-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 liter of cells was grown in YPAD to an A600 of around 1.0, harvested, and digested with Zymolyase T100 (Seikagaku). The nuclei were isolated by differential centrifugation and resuspended in digestion buffer according to the size of the nuclei pellet, and digested by 0, 2, 4, and 8 units/ml of micrococcal nuclease (MNase, Worthington) for 10 min at 37 °C. The purified DNA was digested with PstI restriction enzyme, and the products were detected by Southern Blotting using a 200-bp probe specific for the PstI fragment (13Li B. Reese J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33788-33797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA digested by (PstI plus MluI) and (PstI plus EagI) was loaded as the marker. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described in previous publications with minor changes (39Hecht A. Grunstein M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 40Sharma V.M. Li B. Reese J.C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 50 ml of cells was grown in YPAD media to A600 of 0.5–1.0 and cross-linked for 15 min at 23 °C by the addition of formaldehyde to 1%. The induced cells were treated at A600 of 0.7 with 0.03% MMS and incubated for 2 h before cross-linking. Cross-linking was terminated by the addition of glycine (125 mm) followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 min. Extracts were prepared by glass bead disruption, and the chromatin was sheared into fragments averaging in size of 300–400 bp. The extracts were then clarified by centrifugation, and 200 μl was used for immunoprecipitation. 1 μl of di-acetylated H3 antibody (Upstate), anti-TBP polyclonal antiserum, anti-myc (9E10, Covance), 8WG16 monoclonal antibody (Covance), and 1/300 diluted anti-Tup1 polyclonal antibody were used routinely. The immune complexes were isolated on 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and washed, and the DNA was eluted. After reversing the cross-links at 65 °C overnight, the immunoprecipitated and input DNA were analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR. The PCR products were analyzed on agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, scanned with a Typhoon system (Molecular Dynamics), and quantified by ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). The amplified immunoprecipitated DNA was normalized to the input samples. Results are averages and standard errors from three to six batches of independently prepared extracts. Repression of DNA Damage-inducible Genes in the Absence of Nucleosome Positioning—The RNR3 gene is an Ssn6-Tup1-dependent gene whose regulation correlates with nucleosome positioning and disruption (13Li B. Reese J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33788-33797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our previous studies indicate that disrupting nucleosome positioning is not sufficient to achieve a high level of derepression or preinitiation complex assembly, suggesting that other mechanisms carry out repression in the absence of nucleosome positioning (14Zhang Z. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, we set out to define what pathways mediate Tup1 repression when nucleosome positioning is disrupted. Fig. 1A shows that deleting the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the ISW2 complex, ISW2 (41Tsukiyama T. Palmer J. Landel C.C. Shiloach J. Wu C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 686-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), disrupts nucleosome positioning over the promoter and into the coding sequence of RNR3. Moreover, the pattern is indistinguishable from that of digested naked DNA or that of a Δcrt1 mutant, suggesting that nucleosome positioning is completely disrupted in the Δisw2 mutant. Specifically, the TATA box and promoter is exposed to micrococcal nuclease digestion (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, transcription of RNR3 was only moderately increased (Fig. 1B), about a 2.5-fold increase, versus a 40- to 50-fold increase in fully derepressed cells (+MMS). Importantly, RNR3 can be fully derepressed in the Δisw2 cells, suggesting that the failure to observe a high level of transcription in these cells is not caused by an indirect effect on the derepression/activation machinery. A similar transcription phenotype was observed at HUG1, another gene controlled by Crt1-Ssn6-Tup1 and the DNA damage checkpoint pathway (42Basrai M.A. Velculescu V.E. Kinzler K.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7041-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Like RNR3, the chromatin structure at HUG1 is dependent upon ISW2 (14Zhang Z. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These results suggest that disruption of nucleosome positioning is insufficient to cause a high level of derepression of these DNA damage-inducible genes. The Histone Deacetylase Hda1 Is Required for Full Repression of the DNA Damage-inducible Genes—Because one mechanism of Tup1-mediated repression involves the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs), we explored a role for HDA1 in repression. Hda1 is a class II HDAC that interacts with Tup1 (18Wu J. Suka N. Carlson M. Grunstein M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and the global gene expression profiles of Δhda1 and Δtup1 mutants overlap considerably (43Robyr D. Suka Y. Xenarios I. Kurdistani S.K. Wang A. Suka N. Grunstein M. Cell. 2002; 109: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Derepression of RNR3 by MMS treatment results in a 3-fold increase in the acetylation of lysines 9 and 14 of H3 (Fig. 2A, upper left) (40Sharma V.M. Li B. Reese J.C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We found that deleting HDA1 resulted in an increase in H3 acetylation to a level comparable to that of the induced condition (Fig. 2A, upper left), suggesting that Hda1 is required for deacetylating histone H3 at the RNR3 promoter. However, only slight, if any, increase in RNR3 transcription was observed in the Δhda1 mutant, as compared with that of MMS-treated cells (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1, 3, and 9). A slightly higher level of derepression was observed at HUG1, about 3- to 4-fold, but this level was significantly below that of MMS-treated cells. Because certain HDACs may play a role in transcription activation (44Wang A. Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Science. 2002; 298: 1412-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 45de Nadal E. Zapater M. Alepuz P.M. Sumoy L. Mas G. Posas F Nature. 2004; 427: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar; and see below), it is a formal possibility that the failure to observe a high level of derepression in the Δhda1 cells results from the muting of transcription due to the positive effects of HDACs. However, data arguing against this are the robust MMS-induced increase in RNR3 and HUG1 transcription in the Δhda1 mutant (Fig. 2B, lane 11; and see below). To support the Northern blot data, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to monitor the cross-linking of TBP and RNA polymerase II (Rpb1), to analyze preinitiation complex (PIC) formation. A 3- and 8-fold increase in TBP and Rpb1 cross-linking, respectively, was detected in MMS-treated versus untreated cells. In contrast, no significant change was detected in the Δhda1 mutant (Fig. 2A, bottom). Thus, mimicking histone H3 acetylation increases by this genetic strategy failed to activate the gene or cause PIC formation. We next examined if Tup1 is present at RNR3 in the Δhda1 mutant, and found that Tup1 cross-linking was not reduced, suggesting it is capable of repressing transcription though histone H3 acetylation is high. Most, if not all, genes undergo both chromatin disruption and enhanced histone acetylation upon induction, and RNR3 is no exception (Figs. 1 and 2) (40Sharma V.M. Li B. Reese J.C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, we wondered if simultaneously disrupting nucleosome positioning and increasing histone acetylation by deleting ISW2 and HDA1, respectively, would cause an enhanced level of derepression of RNR3 and HUG1. The level of derepression was compared in a double Δisw2/Δhda1 mutant and the single mutants, and we found that the double mutant had higher levels of derepression than either of the single mutants. HUG1 was more sensitive to the mutations than RNR3, displaying a higher level of derepression. However, the levels of transcription were significantly below that of MMS-treated cells. This suggests that even though both ISW2 and HDA1 play a role in the repression of DNA damage-inducible genes, a significant level of repression remains when nucleosome positioning is disrupted and histone H3 is acetylated. Next, we explored the role of RPD3 in the repression of RNR3 and HUG1. ISW2 collaborates with RPD3 in the repression of many genes in vivo, and a microarray analysis reports that RNR3 is up-regulated about 1.6-fold in a Δisw2/Δrpd3 mutant (46Fazzio T.G. Kooperberg C. Goldmark J.P. Neal C. Basom R. Delrow J. Tsukiyama T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6450-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, deletion of RPD3 did not cause derepression of RNR3 or HUG1, and in fact, reduced the basal and MMS-induced levels of gene expression (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1, 5, 9, and 13). The MMS-induced levels of transcription in the Δrpd3 mutant are reduced approximately 3- to 6-fold for RNR3 and HUG1, respectively. Moreover, the induction of RNR3 and HUG1 was reduced in all mutants containing the Δrpd3 mutation (Fig. 2B, lanes 13–16; also see below, Fig. 3A). A positive role of the class I HDACs in gene expression agrees with recent reports (44Wang A. Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Science. 2002; 298: 1412-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 45de Nadal E. Zapater M. Alepuz P.M. Sum"

A predominant phenotype of β-pol null mouse fibroblasts is hypersensitivity to the DNA-methylating agent methyl methanesulfonate. Residues in the 8-kDa domain of β-pol that seem to interact with a known natural product β-pol inhibitor, koetjapic acid, were identified by NMR chemical shift mapping. The data implicate the binding pocket as the hydrophobic cleft between helix-2 and helix-4, which provides the DNA binding and deoxyribose phosphate lyase activities of the enzyme. Nine structurally related synthetic compounds, containing aromatic or other hydrophobic groups in combination with two carboxylate groups, were then tested. They were found to bind to the same or a very similar region on the surface of the enzyme. The ability of these compounds to potentiate methyl methanesulfonate cytotoxicity, an indicator of cellular BER capacity, in wild-type and β-pol null mouse fibroblasts, was next ascertained. The most active and β-pol-specific of these agents, pamoic acid, was further characterized and found to be an inhibitor of the deoxyribose phosphate lyase and DNA polymerase activities of purified β-pol on a BER substrate. Our results illustrate that NMR-based mapping techniques can be used in the design of small molecule enzyme inhibitors including those with potential use in a clinical setting.

DNA polymerase β (β-pol) 1The abbreviations used are: β-pol, DNA polymerase β; BER, base excision repair; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; dRP, deoxyribose phosphate; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; KJA, koetjapic acid; PA, pamoic acid; GA, glycyrrhizic acid; CBX, carbenoxolone; MB, mordant blue. 1The abbreviations used are: β-pol, DNA polymerase β; BER, base excision repair; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; dRP, deoxyribose phosphate; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; KJA, koetjapic acid; PA, pamoic acid; GA, glycyrrhizic acid; CBX, carbenoxolone; MB, mordant blue. is critical for protection of cells against the harmful effects of such single base lesions in DNA, most probably because of its roles in multiple DNA base excision repair (BER) pathways. The simplest and most well characterized ‘single nucleotide’ BER pathway comprises five sequential steps: excision of the damaged base by a specific glycosylase, strand cleavage by apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease, DNA synthesis and removal of the deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) by β-pol, and ligation of the nick by a DNA ligase (1Srivastava D.K.

Controlled proteolysis and structural studies have revealed that β-pol is organized into two distinct domains. The 31-kDa domain has double stranded DNA binding and DNA polymerase activity, and the 8-kDa domain contributes single-stranded nucleic acid binding and dRP lyase activity (2Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The solution structure of the 8-kDa domain (residues 1-87) has been determined by NMR (3Liu D.-J. Prasad R. Wilson S.H.

Biol. 2000; 296: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cellular requirement for β-pol, specifically the dRP lyase activity of β-pol, for repair of damaged bases was demonstrated earlier by studies of the hypersensitivity of β-pol null mouse embryonic fibroblasts to the monofunctional methylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (5Sobol R.W.

Active agents, as ascertained by inhibition of β-pol DNA synthesis activity in in vitro assays, have been discovered in extracts from bacteria, marine organisms, fungi, and higher plants (8Chen J.

Many of the “β-pol inhibitory” compounds (glycoglycerolipids, sulfolipids, triterpenoids, phenalenone derivatives) have been found to inhibit other polymerases as well (e.g. DNA polymerases α, γ, and λ and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase) (15Ogawa A.

(Tokyo). 2002; 132: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); certain triterpenoid-derivative polymerase inhibitors were more recently found to also inhibit topoisomerases (21Mizushina Y. Iida A. Ohta K. Sugawara F. Sakaguchi K. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).In several previous studies, the long-term aim given for the identification of potent β-pol inhibitors is the possibility of inhibiting repair of DNA adducts formed after treatment with DNA-damaging anticancer drugs and thus potentiating chemotherapeutic treatments. However, β-pol null cells are not significantly hypersensitive to many clinically useful, DNA-alkylating antitumor agents, including the monofunctional and bifunctional chloroethylating agents mitozolomide and melphalan and the nitrosourea 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (7Horton J.K. Joyce-Gray D.F. Pachkowski B.F. Swenberg J.A. Wilson S.H. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), nor are they hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (5Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 22Raaphorst G.P. Ng C.E. Yang D.P. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 2002; 18: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although β-pol has been shown to be involved in the repair of bleomycin-induced DNA damage in vitro (23Miller M.R. Chinault D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10204-10209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Xu Y.-j. Kim E.Y. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28837-28844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), hypersensitivity to this agent is observed only in late passage, but not early passage, β-pol null mouse fibroblasts (25Horton J.K. Baker A. Vande Berg B.J. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Overexpression of β-pol has been associated with resistance to cisplatin (26Canitrot Y. Cazaux C. Frechet M. Bouayadi K. Lesca C. Salles B. Hoffmann J.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12586-12590Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and down-regulation of β-pol by antisense RNA was able to sensitize mammalian cells to this agent (27Horton J.K. Srivastava D.K. Zmudzka B.Z. Wilson S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3810-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); however, in the β-pol null cells, no hypersensitivity is observed (25Horton J.K. Baker A. Vande Berg B.J. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The only clinical agent found to elicit significant hypersensitivity in β-pol null mouse fibroblasts is the methylating triazene derivative temozolomide (7Horton J.K. Joyce-Gray D.F. Pachkowski B.F. Swenberg J.A. Wilson S.H. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Another valid reason for discovery of specific β-pol inhibitors that can penetrate cells is the potential for use of such agents as probes to dissect DNA polymerase functions in the various sub-pathways of repair. For example, inhibition of cellular β-pol-dependent repair by such a compound in an already repair-deficient background (e.g. x-ray cross-complementing factor 1 [XRCC1] -/- or xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A [XPA] -/-) could provide information on the requirement for activity of other repair proteins within a repair pathway and associations between repair activities across specific repair pathways. As discussed above, a predominant phenotype of β-pol null mouse fibroblasts is hypersensitivity to monofunctional alkylating agents such as MMS. Thus, in mouse fibroblasts, an appropriate way to assay for a block of intracellular β-pol activity is to look for an increase in cellular sensitivity to MMS. Such an enhancement of MMS cytotoxicity has been reported previously for one β-pol inhibitor (15Ogawa A. Murate T. Izuta S. Takemura M. Furuta K. Kobayashi J. Kamikawa T. Nimura Y. Yoshida S. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, in most studies in which cellular sensitivity was evaluated, the DNA-damaging agents used were bleomycin or cisplatin (8Chen J. Zhang Y.-H. Wang L.-K. Sucheck S.J. Snow A.M. Hecht S.M. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1998; : 2769-2770Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Deng J.-Z. Starck S.R. Sun D.-A. Sabat M. Hecht S.M. J.

Prod. 1999; 62: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The interaction of bile acid and long-chain fatty acid β-pol inhibitors with the N-terminal 8-kDa domain of β-pol has been analyzed previously by NMR (29Mizushina Y. Ohkubo T. Date T. Yamaguchi T. Saneyoshi M. Sugawara F. Sakaguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25599-25607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30Mizushina Y. Ohkubo T. Sugawara F. Sakaguchi K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12606-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the current study, the binding site for a known natural product β-pol inhibitor, koetjapic acid (KJA) (10Sun D.-A. Starck S.R. Locke E.P. Hecht S.M. J. Nat. Prod. 1999; 62: 1110-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was localized by NMR chemical shift mapping of the β-pol 8-kDa domain. Large chemical shifts were observed upon binding, and this allowed us to make approximate assignments of the inhibitor and β-pol interfaces. The NMR binding study was then extended to include structurally similar synthetic terpenoids and finally other synthetic compounds containing aromatic or other hydrophobic groups in combination with two carboxylate groups. Dissociation constants for binding were estimated for these compounds, and the binding sites on the β-pol 8-kDa domain were mapped. The ability of the nine synthetic compounds with the highest binding affinities to potentiate MMS cytotoxicity in wild-type and β-pol null mouse embryonic fibroblasts was then ascertained. The most active and most β-pol-specific agent, pamoic acid (PA), was found to be inhibitory for activity in in vitro assays for both the dRP lyase and DNA polymerase activities of β-pol. Overall, these results illustrate the utility of NMR chemical shift mapping in small molecule enzyme inhibitor development, including those with potential for use in a clinical setting.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides purified by high pressure liquid chromatography were obtained from Oligos Etc, Inc. (Wilsonville, OR). [α-32P]ddATP and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Recombinant human full-length β-pol, 8-kDa β-pol, uracil-DNA glycosylase with 84 amino acids deleted from the amino terminus, and AP endonuclease were overexpressed and purified as described previously (2Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 31Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E.

Starck S.R. Locke E.P. Hecht S.M. J. Nat. Prod. 1999; 62: 1110-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The synthetic compounds, glycyrrhizic acid (GA), carbenoxolone (CBX), PA, mordant blue (MB), biquinoline-dicarboxylic acid, naphthochrome green, 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene) bis(benzoic acid), and 4′4′-biphenyl dicarboxylic acid were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and 3-(4-carboxyphenyl) 2,3-dihydrotrimethyl 1-indene-5-carboxylic acid was from Acros Organics/Fisher Scientific. These agents were dissolved in high pH 25 mm sodium phosphate dibasic at a concentration of 10 mm; unless specified otherwise, the pH of the solutions was brought down or raised to pH 7.2-7.4 by addition of the appropriate volume of HCl or NaOH with constant stirring and monitoring of the pH. Solutions were stored at 4 °C.NMR Chemical Shift Mapping—NMR titrations were performed using 100 μm β-pol 8-kDa domain. Inhibitor stock solutions were 5-20 mm and were titrated such that the 600-μl NMR sample was diluted by no more than 10%. All NMR HSQC spectra were acquired at 25 °C on a four-channel Varian Inova-500 spectrometer equipped with a pulse field gradient triple-resonance probe. NMR data were processed and peak picked using Felix (Biosym Inc.) with scripts generated from the web site sbtools.uchc.edu.Measurement of Dissociation Binding Constants—When the inhibitor exchange rate is greater than the chemical shift difference between the free and bound states (as observed for the inhibitors in this study), the observed chemical shift, δav, is a weighted average between the chemical shifts of the free and bound states (3Liu D.-J. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DeRose E.F. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6188-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Lian L.Y. Barsukov I.L. Sutcliffe M.J. Sze K.H. Roberts G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) given by δav=[PB][PT]δB+(1−[PB][PT])δF(Eq. 1) where δF is the chemical shift of the protein in the absence of inhibitor, δB is the chemical shift of the protein bound to inhibitor, [PB] is the concentration of inhibitor-bound protein and [PT] is the total concentration of protein. In the fast exchange regime, addition of inhibitor results in the gradual shifting of the protein resonances from the free to bound positions (see Supplemental Material). The dependence of the observed chemical shift, δav, on the total inhibitor concentration, [ST], is related to the dissociation constant, [KD], through its effect on the concentration of inhibitor-bound protein, [PB] (3Liu D.-J. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DeRose E.F. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6188-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Lian L.Y. Barsukov I.L. Sutcliffe M.J. Sze K.H. Roberts G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 2. [PB]=0.5 (KD+[ST]+[PT]−(KD+[ST]+[PT])2−4[ST][PT])(Eq. 2) Dissociation constants of the order of the total protein concentration can therefore be determined quite accurately, although the accuracy decreases for very tight binders. Nevertheless, dissociation constants 1 order of magnitude lower than the protein concentration can readily be distinguished with this method (see Supplemental Material).Cell Lines and Cytotoxicity Studies—Clones of the previously characterized wild-type and β-pol null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MB16.3 and MB19.4, respectively) and cell culture conditions have been described previously (5Sobol R.W.

Alternate isogenically matched wild-type (MB36.3) and β-pol null (MB38Δ4) cell lines and β-pol null cells expressing Flag epitope-tagged, full-length, wild-type or 8-kDa domain β-pol proteins have also been described previously (6Sobol R.W. Prasad R. Evenski A. Baker A. Yang X.-P. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 34 °C in a 10% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) supplemented with GlutaMAX-1 (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), and hygromycin (80 μg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were routinely tested and found to be free of mycoplasma contamination.Cytotoxicity was determined by growth inhibition assays as described previously (34Horton J.K. Prasad R. Hou E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2211-2218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Wild-type and β-pol null mouse fibroblasts (MB16.3 and MB19.4, respectively, unless otherwise indicated) were seeded at a density of 40,000 cells/well in six-well dishes. The following day, cells were exposed for 1 h to a range of concentrations of MMS in growth medium without hygromycin and in the presence or absence of the β-pol inhibitor under study. Cells were then washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen), and fresh medium plus or minus inhibitor was added. Dishes were incubated for 4-5 days at 34 °C in a 10% CO2 incubator until untreated control cells were ∼80% confluent. Cells (triplicate wells for each drug concentration) were counted by a cell lysis procedure (35Butler W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and results were expressed as the number of cells in drug-treated wells relative to control wells.3′-End Labeling—Dephosphorylated 34-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide (5′-CTGCAGCTGATGCGCUGTACGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′) containing a uracil residue at position 16 was 3′-end-labeled with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and [α-32P]ddATP. The complementary DNA strand (5′-GTACCCGGGGATCCGTACGGCGCATCAGCTGCAG-3′) was annealed by heating the solution at 90 °C for 3 min, and the solution was allowed to slowly cool to 25 °C. 32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotide was separated from unincorporated [α-32P]ddATP using a Sephadex G-25 column according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The radiolabeled oligonucleotide was stored at -30 °C until use.Uracil-DNA Glycosylase/AP Endonuclease Treatment of DNA Substrate—In general, 50 nm32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotide substrate was pretreated with 10 nm human uracil-DNA glycosylase in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was then supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2 and 10 nm AP endonuclease and the incubation continued for 20 min at 37 °C. These reactions generated substrates for DNA synthesis (15-mer with 3′-OH) and dRP lyase assays (32P-labeled 19-mer with 5′-sugar phosphate) as shown in Fig. 6a. Because of the labile nature of the dRP-containing DNA, this DNA substrate was prepared just before performing the experiment.Pretreatment of β-pol with PA—β-Pol (100 nm) and PA (50 to 2500 μm) were mixed (1:1, v/v) in enzyme dilution buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20% glycerol) and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. This mixture was used to initiate the dRP lyase/DNA gap-filling synthesis reaction resulting in a final concentration of 10 nm β-pol and 5-250 μm PA.DNA Gap-Filling Synthesis and dRP Lyase Assay—The lyase and DNA gap-filling synthesis reactions were performed as described previously (1Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2.3 μm [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity, 1 × 106 dpm/pmol) and 50 nm 3′-end labeled DNA. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 nm β-pol, either pretreated or not with PA. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reaction was terminated with 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and the products were stabilized by addition of NaBH4 to a final concentration of 340 mm and incubated for 30 min at 0 °C. The stabilized products were recovered by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml tRNA and resuspended in 10 μl of DNA gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol). After incubation at 75 °C for 2 min, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea in 89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.8. The amount of radioactivity in the product bands was quantified using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSChemical Shift Mapping of the Interaction Interface of Inhibitors and β-pol—15N-labeled recombinant 8-kDa domain of human β-pol (2Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) was first titrated with the known natural product β-pol inhibitor, KJA (10Sun D.-A. Starck S.R. Locke E.P. Hecht S.M. J. Nat. Prod. 1999; 62: 1110-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The compound bound with high affinity (KD = 11 μm; Table I), and residues that seemed to interact with the inhibitor were identified by NMR chemical shift mapping. Thirty-four structurally related and soluble synthetic compounds were similarly analyzed. Of these, nine compounds were selected that contained aromatic or other hydrophobic groups in combination with two carboxylate groups and had binding constants in the micromolar range estimated from NMR titrations. The molecular structures of KJA, and the nine compounds chosen for more detailed analysis are shown in Fig. 1. 15N-labeled 8-kDa domain of human β-pol was titrated with each of these synthetic compounds, and the backbone amide chemical shifts were monitored in 15N-HSQC spectra. For each of the agents studied, the amide proton and nitrogen resonances of affected residues shifted gradually as the concentration of inhibitor was increased, indicating that the binary complexes were in fast exchange on the NMR timescale (kex>> 150 s-1). Changes in chemical shift were analyzed to ascertain both the structural interface as well as the dissociation constant of interaction, as shown for KJA, GA, CBX, and PA in Figs. 2 and 3.Table IDissociation constants for binding to β-pol 8-kDa domain and enhancement of growth inhibitory effect of MMS by β-pol inhibitorsCompoundaAbbreviations are defined in Fig. 1.KDbDissociation binding constants (KD) were determined from NMR titrations as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard error is quoted as the “goodness of fit” in fitting the data.Wild-type (x)c-Fold enhancement of growth inhibitory effect of 2 mm MMS in wild-type cells (x) or 1 mm MMS in β-pol null cells (y). x and y are defined in Fig. 4.

https://openalex.org/W2162889783,"Aberrant secretion of lysosomal hydrolases such as (pro)cathepsin D (proCD) is a common phenotypic change in many human cancers. Here we explore the underlying molecular defect(s) and find that MCF-7 breast and CaCo-2 colorectal cancer cells that are unable to acidify their endosomal compartments secreted higher amounts of proCD than did acidification-competent cancer cell types. The latter secreted equivalent amounts of proCD only after dissipation of their organellar pH gradients with NH4Cl. Assessing the critical steps that resulted in proCD secretion revealed that the Golgi-associated sorting receptor for CD, i.e. the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR300), was aberrantly distributed in acidification-defective MCF-7 cells. It accumulated mainly in late endosomes and/or lysosomes as a complex with its ligand (proCD or intermediate CD), as evidenced by its co-localization with both CD and LAMP-2, a late endosome/lysosome marker. Our immunoprecipitation analyses also showed that MCF-7 cells possessed 7-fold higher levels of receptor-enzyme complexes than did acidification-competent cells. NH4Cl induced similar receptor redistribution into LAMP-2-positive structures in acidification-competent cells but not in MCF-7 cells. The receptor also recovered its normal Golgi localization upon drug removal. Based on these observations, we conclude that defective acidification results in the aberrant secretion of proCD in certain cancer cells and interferes mainly with the normal disassembly of the receptor-enzyme complexes and efficient receptor reutilization in the Golgi.

Like many other lysosomal hydrolases, cathepsin D (CD) 1The abbreviations used are: CD, cathepsin D; proCD, (pro)cathepsin D; MPR300, cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor; MPR46, cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TGN, trans-Golgi network. is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum as an inactive (52-54 kDa) glycosylated propeptide (1Gieselmann V. Pohlmann R. Hasilik A. von Figura K. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the Golgi, proCD is tagged with a phosphomannosyl targeting signal (mannose-6-phosphate) that mediates its cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR300)-dependent sorting into the endosomal compartments (2Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 3Koster A. Saftig P. Matzner U. von Figura K. Peters C. Pohlmann R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5219-5223Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The other receptor, the cation-dependent receptor (MPR46), is thought to bind a distinct set of lysosomal enzymes (4Pohlmann R.

Cell Res. 1994; 215: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). After transport to endosomes, MPR300-ligand complexes are disassembled and the receptor is recycled back to the Golgi/TGN via a retromer-assisted transport system (8Ghosh P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S.

Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), whereas proCD is further cleaved into a 44-kDa intermediate form (10Rijnboutt S. Kal A.J. Geuze H.J. Aerts H. Stroud G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23586-23592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wittlin S. Rosel J. Hofmann F. Stover D.R. Eur. J.

Pohlmann R. Hasilik A. von Figura K. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Many breast and colorectal cancer cells anomalously secrete increased amounts of cathepsins B and D into the extracellular space where these enzymes have been shown to contribute to the invasive and metastatic properties of cancer cells (12Schwartz M.K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1995; 237: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 13Koblinski J.E. Ahram M. Sloane B.F. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2000; 291: 113-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Previously, a number of possibilities have been put forward and tested as potential causes for CD secretion in cancer cells. These include e.g. increased expression of CD (7Capony F. Braulke T. Rougeot C. Roux S. Montcourrier P. Rochefort H. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), its altered binding to the MPR46 (7Capony F. Braulke T. Rougeot C. Roux S. Montcourrier P. Rochefort H. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), a failure of cancer cells to synthesize the phosphomannosyl tag (14Isidoro C. Baccino F.M. Hasilik A. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the absence or inactivating/missense mutations in the MPR300 itself (15Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. De Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24408-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, it has also been reported that the secretion of mature CD directly from pericellular lysosomes contributes to CD secretion by metastatic cancer cells (16Sameni M. Elliot E. Ziegler G. Fortgens P.H. Dennison C. Sloane B.F. Pathol. Oncol. Res. 1995; 1: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, none of these observations have provided a satisfying explanation for the secretion of proCD by multiple cancer cell types. It has also been well documented that efficient processing and lysosomal targeting of proCD requires the existence of proper pH gradients between the cytoplasm and the Golgi/TGN or the endosomal compartments. For example, the binding of proCD to MPR300 in the Golgi occurs normally at pH 6.4-6.5 (17Dahms N.M. Hancock M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 317-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), whereas dissociation of the complex requires more acidic pH (18Gonzalez-Noriega A. Grubb J.H. Talkad V. Sly W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 19Gieselmann V. Hasilik A. von Figura K. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3904-3909PubMed Google Scholar). Perturbation of these pH gradients, e.g. with chloroquine or ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), results in delayed intracellular maturation of proCD (7Capony F. Braulke T. Rougeot C. Roux S. Montcourrier P. Rochefort H. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and its increased secretion from the cells (21Braulke T. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Hasilik A. von Figura K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 43: 316-321PubMed Google Scholar, 22Isidoro C. Demoz M. DeStefanis D. Mainferme F. Wattiaux R. Baccino F.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). pH alterations are commonly associated with malignant transformation and growth (23Perona R. Serrano R. Nature. 1988; 334: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Yuan J. Narayanan L. Rockwell S. Glazer P.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4372-4376PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hill R.P. De Jaeger K.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2811-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 28Altan N. Chen Y. Schindler M. Simon S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1583-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). pH-dissipating drugs also do not increase the secretion of CD in cancer cells, in contrast to normal cells (20Capony F. Rougeot C. Montcourrier P. Cavailles V. Salazar G. Rochefort H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3904-3909PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that an altered pH homeostasis might be an additional cause for the secretion of proCD in various cancer cell lines. Here we explore this possibility by using, for the first time, cell lines that either can or cannot acidify their intracellular organelles properly. Previous work (27Schindler M. Grabski S. Hoff E. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2811-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 28Altan N. Chen Y. Schindler M. Simon S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1583-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) has shown that such breast cancer cell lines exist (MCF-7 and MCF-7/AdrR cells) and that their inability/ability to acidify correlates well with their sensitivity/resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Because MCF-7 cells are also known to secrete CD (20Capony F. Rougeot C. Montcourrier P. Cavailles V. Salazar G. Rochefort H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3904-3909PubMed Google Scholar), they provide a convenient drug-free system to assess the pH dependence and the molecular details in CD sorting that are affected by defective acidification. Utilizing these two breast cancer cell lines and three randomly selected colorectal cancer cell lines with unknown acidification potential we now report that an acidification defect correlates with increased CD secretion and impairs normal lysosomal sorting of proCD by reducing the amount of the free receptor in the Golgi. Cell Lines and Culturing—Human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7), and human colorectal adeno-carcinoma cell lines (HT-29, SW-48, and CaCo-2) were all obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Multidrug-resistant MCF-7/AdrR cells were kindly provided to us by Dr. Myles Cabot (Santa Monica, CA). All cell lines were maintained at 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Promo Cell®, Heidelberg, Germany), Glutamax, and antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin). Antibodies—The cathepsin D polyclonal antibody used for Western blotting and immunostaining was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The polyclonal anti-cathepsin D antibody used for immunoprecipitations was purchased from Calbiochem. Polyclonal antibodies against MPR300 were kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Braulke (University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany) and Dr. Varpu Marjomäki (University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland). The monoclonal anti-MPR300 antibody and polyclonal antibodies against EEA-1 (early endosomal antigen 1) were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). The monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (clone B-5-1-2) was from Sigma-Aldrich, and the monoclonal antibody against GM130 (Golgi matrix protein of 130 kDa) was from BD Biosciences-Transduction Laboratories. The monoclonal antibody against LAMP-2 (H4B4) was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). Alexa-488- and Alexa-594-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies as well as the Alexa-488-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-goat secondary antibodies were purchased from P. A. R. I. S. (Compiègne, France) or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on glass coverslips with or without NH4Cl prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. After blocking (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)), the cells were single- or double-stained using both monoclonal and polyclonal anti-MPR300 antibodies simultaneously with the anti-cathepsin D antibody and organelle marker antibodies (GM130, EEA-1, and LAMP-2). Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for visualization. Cells were embedded with Immu-Mount (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA), and stained specimens were examined and photographed using an Olympus epifluorescence microscope and a CCD camera. Staining of Acidic Organelles with the LysoSensor Dye—Cells were grown on glass coverslips overnight at normal cell culture conditions. Culture medium was then replaced with the fresh medium containing 2 μm LysoSensor Yellow/Blue DND-160 (Molecular Probes). Cells were incubated for an additional 5 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2 before being rinsed briefly with PBS and photographed by using the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) filter set and a 60× water immersion objective. Identical microscope and camera settings were used for each specimen. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Cells were grown to near confluence in 10-cm dishes, washed once, scraped into PBS (Invitrogen), and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was solubilized directly in 2× reducing SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and bromphenol blue). To shear the DNA, the samples were heated and subjected to a vigorous vortex for 5 min at 95 °C before analyses by SDS-PAGE. After size separation, proteins were transferred onto the Protran® nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder (Blotto) or 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1% glycerol in PBS for antibodies against human cathepsin D and MPR300. Membranes were washed with the same buffer and incubated with appropriately diluted primary and 1:10 000 diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Protein bands were visualized using chemiluminescence substrates (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to Hyperfilm ECL-films (Amersham Biosciences) for 1-30 min before quantification of the bands with the PhosphorImager software (ImageQuant version 5.2, Amersham Biosciences). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitations—Cells were metabolically labeled as described earlier (29Suokas M. Myllylä R. Kellokumpu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17863-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were starved for 30 min in cysteine/methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum and antibiotics and then cultivated for 6 h to overnight in the presence of 200 μCi/ml Pro-Mix™ l-35S in vitro cell labeling mix (Amersham Biosciences). Labeled cells were rinsed briefly and chased in culture medium containing an excess of unlabeled cysteine and methionine. 10 mm mannose-6-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to chase medium to prevent endocytosis of secreted proCD (18Gonzalez-Noriega A. Grubb J.H. Talkad V. Sly W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). At appropriate times, culture medium was collected, and cells were lysed on plates with immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS for cathepsin D; and 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for MPR300) in the presence of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science). In ligand dissociation experiments, pH 6 buffer was used instead of pH 7.5. Immunoprecipitations from the media and cell lysates were performed with anti-cathepsin D and protein A-Sepharose or anti-MPR300 and protein G-Sepharose beads. Bound proteins were eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE (10% slab gel). After fixation, the gels were treated with EN3HANCE® (NEN™ Life Science Products, Belgium), dried, and exposed to x-ray films for 1-3 days. Protein bands were quantified using the PhosphorImager software. Release of CD from the Membrane-bound MPR300 —Cells scraped from the confluent plates into PBS were washed and suspended in ice-cold TKM buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cells were disrupted by homogenization using a bent needle and syringe. Sucrose was added to a final concentration of 250 mm. Cell debris and nuclei were discarded by centrifugation (1000 × g; 10 min), and membranes were collected from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation at 100 000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Membranes were resuspended in TKM-buffer supplemented with 0.25 m sucrose and protease inhibitors. To release bound CD from the membranes, the membrane fractions were washed once more with either pH 7.5 (control) or pH 6 buffer. CD was then precipitated from the washing buffers with the anti-CD antibodies as above. MCF-7 and CaCo-2 Cells Are Unable to Acidify their Intracellular Organelles—We first determined the ability of the different cancer cell lines to acidify their intracellular organelles by using the LysoSensor Yellow/Blue indicator dye (Fig. 1). This dye accumulates in acidic organelles (the trans-Golgi, endosomes, and lysosomes) and emits yellow/blue light depending on the acidity of a given organelle. Microscopical examination of stained cells (Fig. 1) demonstrated a large number of bluish (acidic) vesicular structures in COS-7, MCF-7/AdrR, HT-29, and SW-48 cells, consistent with their normal acidification potential. Some SW-48 cells also possessed larger yellowish (i.e. less acidic) vesicular structures whose exact identity is currently not known. In contrast, (Fig. 1), very few stained vesicular structures were detected in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, in accordance with previous observations (27Schindler M. Grabski S. Hoff E. Simon S.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2811-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 28Altan N. Chen Y. Schindler M. Simon S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1583-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only a few dye-positive structures were detected also in CaCo-2 cells, showing that defective acidification is not restricted only to MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The specificity of the dye for acidic organelles was demonstrated by showing that there were no stained organelles present if the cells were treated for 4 h with 100 nm bafilomycin A1, a vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor, prior to staining (data not shown). pH-dependent Intracellular Processing and Secretion of proCD in Cancer Cells—To compare the intracellular processing and secretion of CD in the above cell types, we metabolically labeled cells for 6 h with the Pro-MixTM 35S-labeling reagent. After chase (12 and 24 h) in the presence and the absence of NH4Cl, different CD forms in total cell lysates and culture media were immunoprecipitated before analyses by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 2A). In each cell line, proCD (52 kDa), intermediate CD (mainly the 44 kDa band), and mature CD (30 kDa) were detected. The 52-kDa form, i.e. proCD, was the major form secreted into the culture medium. Quantification revealed (Table I) that the majority (∼60-74%) of the different CD bands consisted of the mature CD (30 kDa band) in all cell types except for MCF-7 and CaCo-2 cells, in which this form represented 37 and 46% of the total CD in the cells, respectively. The immature CD pool (including intracellular proCD and intermediate CD pools) comprised between 13-34% of the total CD found in the cells and the medium (Fig. 2A). The amount of the secreted proCD totalled only 8% in COS-7 cells, whereas in cancer cells secreted proCD ranged from 9 to 44% of the total CD. Highest secretion levels were detected in acidification-defective MCF-7 and CaCo-2 cells (44 and 22%, respectively). Compared with acidification-competent COS-7 and breast cancer MCF-7/AdrR cells, ∼5- and 3-fold higher amounts of proCD were secreted by acidification-defective MCF-7 and CaCo-2 cells, respectively.Fig. 2Secretion of cathepsin D in different cancer cell types in the absence or the presence of NH4Cl.A, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine-[35S]cysteine mix for 6 h and chased for 12 h in the absence and the presence of NH4Cl. Different forms of cathepsin D were immunoprecipitated from the cells and the culture media before analyses by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Notice that the three main CD forms, proCD (52 kDa), intermediate CD (44 kDa), and mature CD (30 kDa), were detected in cells (C) (arrows) whereas proCD was secreted into the medium (M). B, the effect of NH4Cl on intracellular processing and secretion of proCD in different cell types. Note that NH4Cl mainly increased the secretion in acidification-competent COS-7 and cancer cell lines (MCF-7/AdrR, SW-48, and HT-29), whereas in MCF-7 and CaCo-2 cells proCD secretion remained practically unaltered. The drug also slowed down somewhat the intracellular processing of proCD in all cell lines examined, as evidenced by the lower levels of mature CD and the accumulation of immature CD forms in NH4Cl-treated cells. Similar results were obtained in two identical experiments and after 24 h of incubation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IThe relative proportions of different CD forms in cancer cellsMatureImmatureSecretedCOS-772.619.08.5MCF-7/AdrR59.925.614.5MCF-736.519.444.1SW-4873.713.013.2HT-2957.433.59.1CaCo-245.931.922.3 Open table in a new tab Treatment of cells with NH4Cl (10 mm) during the 12 h-chase period changed the relative proportions of different CD forms in all cell types examined (Fig. 2B). The proportion of the mature CD (30 kDa) decreased in all cell types, whereas the level of the immature CD was either decreased (COS-7), roughly equal (HT-29), or increased by ∼2-fold (MCF-7/AdrR, MCF-7, SW-48, and CaCo-2) relative to the levels observed in untreated cells. The amount of the secreted proCD changed most dramatically, totalling between 26 and 35% of the total CD in the cells. The highest increase was observed in COS-7 cells (∼4-fold increase) and SW-48 cells (∼3-fold increase; Fig. 2B). In contrast, in acidification-defective MCF-7 and CaCo-2 cells CD secretion was either slightly lower (MCF-7, 0.8-fold) or slightly higher (CaCo-2, 1.2-fold) than the secretion level observed in the absence of the drug (Fig. 2B). Thus, drug treatment increased the secretion of proCD mainly in acidification-competent cell lines and not in acidification-defective MCF-7 and CaCo-2 cells, demonstrating the strict pH-dependence of CD secretion. Defective Acidification Impairs Dissociation of the Receptor-CD Complexes in MCF-7 Cells—To assess whether the increased secretion of CD in acidification-defective MCF-7 cells is simply due to the absence of the functional MPR300, we performed comparative Western blot analyses with the anti-MPR300 antibody and found that COS-7, MCF-7, and MCF-7/AdrR cells all expressed equal amounts of the receptor (100, 102 and 103%) with respect to the amount of expressed α-tubulin (data not shown). This was also confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 3) with the MPR300 antibody, which stained specific vesicular structures near the nuclei in each of the three cell lines examined. In COS-7 and MCF-7/AdrR cells, these structures were distinct from the vesicular structures stained simultaneously with the anti-CD antibody. However, the receptor and CD showed extensive co-distribution in MCF-7 cells, suggesting that the two proteins predominantly reside in the same intracellular compartments in these cells. The observed co-localization of the CD and the MPR300 in MCF-7 cells also suggested that the two proteins may exist as receptor-ligand complexes. To demonstrate this possibility directly, we immunoprecipitated the receptor from the total lysates (pH 7.5) of the cells metabolically labeled for 16 h and quantified the amount of the co-precipitated cathepsin D in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4A). In each cell line, both proCD and intermediate CD (but not mature CD, data not shown) were detected in the precipitates. However, the amount of the double CD band (proCD and intermediate CD) was low in COS-7 and MCF-7/AdrR cells, giving an intensity ratio of 1:2 between the two CD forms and the MPR300 (Fig. 4B). The proportion of the proCD and intermediate CD forms that co-precipitated with the receptor was much higher in MCF-7 cells. Based on the ratio (3.5:1), the relative levels of MPR300-CD complexes were roughly 7-fold higher in MCF-7 cells than in COS-7 and MCF-7/AdrR cells. To verify that these receptor-CD complexes can be normally dissociated by acidic pH, we also performed immunoprecipitation analyses with slightly acidic pH buffer (pH 6 instead of the pH 7.5 buffer). We found that, at pH 6, the same amount of the receptor protein was precipitated in each cell line (Fig. 4A) without affecting markedly the amounts of the co-immunoprecipitated CD forms in COS-7 and MCF-7/AdrR cells. In MCF-7 cells, however, the receptor-CD complexes dissociated at pH 6, as evidenced by the absence of the two CD forms in the immunoprecipitates. We also treated microsomal membranes prepared from the two breast cancer cell lines with the same pH buffers (Fig. 4C) prior to immunoprecipitation of the different CDs from the high speed supernatant with the anti-CD antibody. Western blot analyses of the precipitates revealed that, in MCF-7 cells, acidic pH (pH 6) resulted in dissociation of the existing receptor-ligand complexes, as both proCD- and intermediate CD bands (52 kDa and 44 kDa) were detected in the supernatant fractions of these cells. Both of these bands were undetectable in MCF-7/AdrR cells in either of the pH buffers used, thus confirming that acidification-competent cells possess only low numbers of these complexes under normal conditions. Receptor-CD Complexes Accumulate in Late Endosomes/Lysosomes in MCF-7 Cells—To define the subcellular compartment(s) in which the receptor-CD complexes accumulated, we double-stained MCF-7 and MCF-7/AdrR cells with the anti-receptor and different organelle marker (Golgi, early and late endosomes, and lysosomes) antibodies (Fig. 5). In acidification-competent MCF-7/AdrR cells, the receptor was found to colocalize extensively with the Golgi marker (GM130). In contrast, the receptor did not co-localize markedly with the early endosomal antigen (data not shown) or with the late endosome/lysosome marker (30Eskelinen E.L. Illert A.L. Tanaka Y. Schwarzmann G. Blanz J. von Figura K. Saftig P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3355-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) LAMP-2 (Fig. 5), which is consistent with its predominant residence in the Golgi membranes. In MCF-7 cells, however, the receptor showed a distinct localization from the Golgi marker antibody (Fig. 5) and co-localized most extensively with the late endosome/lysosome marker, the two proteins showing almost identical distribution in MCF-7 cells. These findings demonstrate that in MCF-7 cells the majority of the MPR300 proteins localize in late endosomes/lysosomes, together with bound CD (Fig. 3). To confirm the pH dependence of the differential localization of the receptor in MCF-7 and MCF-7/AdrR cells, we treated cells with NH4Cl. In acidification-competent MCF-7/AdrR cells, this treatment resulted in marked redistribution of the receptor from the Golgi into LAMP-2-positive structures (Fig. 6). In MCF-7 cells, however, the drug was without effect, as evidenced by the extensive co-localization of the receptor with the late endosome/lysosome marker, despite drug-treatment (Fig. 6). Similarly, drug removal did not cause any redistribution of the receptor in MCF-7 cells (data not shown), whereas in acidification-competent MCF-7/AdrR cells the receptor recovered its normal Golgi localization upon drug removal, as assessed by its co-localization with the Golgi marker (Fig. 6). Thus, it is shown that the existing pH gradients clearly affect the steady state distribution of the MPR300 between the Golgi and the endosomal compartments and that the receptor, under acidic conditions but not under neutral conditions, efficiently recycles back to the Golgi, consistent with its reutilization in the TGN (8Ghosh P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Efficient vesicular trafficking and the correct sorting of proteins, including CD, are known to be dependent on proper ion and pH homeostasis within the secretory and endocytic compartments. Specific sorting or transport steps that have turned out to be the most sensitive to pH alterations include transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi (31Wilson D.W. Lewis M.J.

Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 835-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), or between the TGN and post-Golgi organelles (35Caplan M.J. Stow J.L. Newman A.P. Madri J. Anderson H.C. Farquhar M.G.

Physiol. 2003; 285: C205-C214Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the molecular switches that are regulated by pH and result in altered vesicular trafficking between the organelles. In this report, we extend these findings and report for the first time that defective acidification in certain cancer cells is the primary cause for their anomalous secretion of proCD. We also provide evidence to show that this secretion results from an altered intracellular trafficking of the MPR300 and from its prolonged association with proCD, whereby the receptor-enzyme complexes accumulate in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. On the basis of these observations it is suggested (Fig. 7) that, in the virtual absence of the free MPR300 in the Golgi, the newly synthesized proCD can freely enter constitutive transport vesicles and eventually be secreted from the cells. Aberrant secretion of proCD in acidification-defective cancer cells can thus be considered primarily as a pH-dependent receptor-sorting defect. The fact that acidification-defective MCF-7 cells nevertheless possess high amounts of mature CD (Fig. 2) is not in conflict with this suggestion, as it has been well documented that proCD is also targeted to lysosomes via MPR300-independent mechanisms (10Rijnboutt S.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1591-1597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also confirmed that all of the cell lines examined express roughly equivalent amounts of MPR300 (Figs. 3 and 4A). Therefore, secretion of proCD does not result from the total absence of the MPR300 or its complete inability to bind proCD in the Golgi, as was evidenced by the presence of newly formed receptor-proCD complexes in these cells (Figs. 3 and 4). Previous work has also shown that the mannose-6-phosphate-containing ligands are also able to bind to MPR300 at pH 6.9-7 (17Dahms N.M. Hancock M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 317-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), i.e. at the pH of the Golgi/TGN in MCF-7 cells. 2A. Rivinoja., N. Kokkonen, A. Kauppila, P. Neubauer, I. Kellokumpu, and S. Kellokumpu, manuscript in preparation. The observed binding of CD to its receptor in MCF-7 cells also excludes the possibility that the lack of phosphomannosyl addition is responsible for aberrant secretion of CD in the cells, consistent with previous observations (14Isidoro C. Baccino F.M. Hasilik A. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 70: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Rather, our indirect immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation data showed that defective acidification increases CD secretion mainly by interfering with the receptor-ligand dissociation and receptor recycling (Figs. 4, 5, 6). According to our results, the MPR300 co-localized extensively with both CD and LAMP-2, a late endosome/lysosome marker, in acidification-defective MCF-7 cells. Similarly, NH4Cl induced extensive co-localization of the MPR300 and LAMP-2 in acidification-competent cells (Fig. 6), which is consistent with this redistribution being a pH-dependent process. In MCF-7 cells, drug treatment or its removal had no effect on receptor localization. This is exactly what one would expect if the pH of the endosomal compartments in these cells is at a steady state neutral enough (Fig. 1) to prevent the normal disassembly of the receptor-proCD complexes in these compartments. Our results thus seem to provide a logical explanation for the inability of pH-dissipating drugs to increase the secretion of CD also in other cancer cell types (7Capony F. Braulke T. Rougeot C. Roux S. Montcourrier P. Rochefort H. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41DeStefanis D. Demoz M. Dragonetti A. Houri J.J. Ogier-Denis E. Codogno P. Baccino F.M. Isidoro C. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 289: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or to alter receptor distribution in these cells (Fig. 6). Our findings are also compatible with recent studies showing that the knock down of one of the retromer subunits required for receptor recycling back to the Golgi results in receptor accumulation in late endosomes/lysosomes, perhaps indicating a shortened receptor half-life in these cells (9Arighi C.N. Hartnell L.M. Aguilar R.C. Haft C.R. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Although not addressed here, this may also be the case in MCF-7 cells in which the receptor was found to accumulate in LAMP-2-positive structures as a complex with its ligands (Figs. 5 and 6). In addition to inhibiting receptor recycling, such prolonged complex formation may halt further proteolytic processing of proCD into mature CD and/or induce the degradation of the receptor-proCD complexes in lysosomes. Whether the accumulation of the receptor-enzyme complexes in late endosomes/lysosomes in MCF-7 cells represents their true end point or degradation or just a “bottle neck” in receptor recycling and reutilization in the TGN remains to be clarified in the future experiments. The prevalence and the applicability of these findings to other CD-secreting cancer cell types remain to be clarified. However, the fact that one of three randomly selected colorectal cancer cell lines tested here was acidification-defective (CaCo-2) suggests that this defect may be more common than previously thought. In further support of this possibility, cells in solid tumors are known to be repetitively or continuously exposed to an acidic extracellular milieu due to hypoxia, altered energy metabolism, and a slow rate of waste removal (42Warburg O. Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9810) Google Scholar, 43Dellian M. Helmlinger G. Yuan F. Jain R.K. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 74: 1206-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In general, these changes give rise to a slightly more alkaline intracellular pH and a reversed pH gradient across cellular membranes. In addition, cytoplasmic alkalinization or extracellular acidification have been implicated previously in several cancer-associated phenotypic alterations, including malignant growth, cellular transformation, altered expression of certain genes, acquisition of multidrug-resistance, and invasion and metastasis (23Perona R.

Recently, we have also reported that such pH alterations in cancer cells may also be responsible for their lowered glycosylation potential (49Kellokumpu S. Sormunen R. Kellokumpu I. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations support the view that such pH alterations may be an inherent part of tumorigenesis and its progression. If true, the findings reported here emphasize the need to develop new approaches and interventions to restore normal acidification potential in cancer cells and to better control their invasive and metastatic growth. Our observation that artificial acidification was able to dissociate the preformed receptor-CD complexes in MCF-7 cells shows that such trials would be feasible. Drs. Thomas Braulke and Varpu Marjomäki are greatly acknowledged for the antibodies. We also thank Dr. Myles Cabot for providing MCF-7/AdrR cells."

Two parameters were assayed: the ability and extent to which the constructs bound to Hsp90 and Cdc37, and the ability of the constructs to trigger salt-resistant high affinity complexes with Hsp90 and Cdc37 independent of the presence of molybdate. Although Hsp90 interacted with both the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes (NL and CL, respectively) of the catalytic domains of the kinases, the lobes themselves were not sufficient to trigger the high affinity binding of Hsp90. Only constructs containing a complete N- or C-terminal lobe and part of the adjacent lobe bound to Hsp90 and Cdc37 in salt-stable complexes independent of molybdate.

Analyses with these compounds, with nucleotides and nucleotide analogs, and with site direct mutants that alter Hsp90 ATP binding and/or ATPase activity have revealed that Hsp90 function is regulated via the binding and hydrolysis of ATP, which modulates the switching of Hsp90 between at least three alternative conformations (1Pratt W.B.

However, in contrast to geldanamycin, this inhibition reflects the ability of molybdate to “lock” or freeze Hsp90 kinase complexes in high affinity salt-stable complexes (20Shao J. Gramatikakis N.

Thus, we have utilized the ability of kinase constructs to trigger molybdate-independent, high affinity, salt-stable interactions with Hsp90 and Cdc37 to define motifs recognized by these chaperones (24Scroggins B.T.

In this report, we have systematically deleted secondary structural elements from the catalytic domain of the Hsp90-dependent Src family protein tyrosine kinase Lck to increase the resolution of motifs recognized by Hsp90 and Cdc37. The data confirm that Cdc37 recognizes structures or sequences present in the N-terminal lobe of the catalytic domain of the kinase. Furthermore, the motifs within the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes of the catalytic domain that are required to trigger nucleotide-dependent conformational switching of Hsp90 and molybdate-independent high affinity binding of Hsp90 and Cdc37 to kinase constructs overlap at the junction of the two subdomains.

These dissections are represented graphically in Fig. 1. Co-immunoprecipitations of Chaperones with His-tagged Kinase Constructs—Lck constructs were cloned via NcoI/EcoRI into a modified pSP64T plasmid that coded for an N-terminal His6 tag. Using a no DNA blank as control for nonspecific binding, each construct was synthesized and radiolabeled with [35S]Met by coupled transcription/translation in 60 μl of nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TnT; Promega) for 24 min at 30 °C. Each sample was then split into two (30 μl) aliquots, supplemented with either 0.5 μl of 1 m sodium molybdate (final concentration, 17 mm) or deionized water, and then incubated for another 1 min. All of the samples were then immediately placed on ice, clarified, and immunoabsorbed with 25 μl of anti-His5 antibody (Qiagen) bound to anti-mouse IgG resin for 1 h at 4 °C (24Scroggins B.T.

Immunoresins were then washed once with P50T (10 mm Pipes, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20), three times with P500T (same as P50T except with 500 mm NaCl), and again with P50T. No NaMoO4 was present in the wash buffers. Finally, the samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blotted for both endogenous Hsp90 and Cdc37 (24Scroggins B.T.

To load approximately equal molar amounts of each translation product, a portion of each TnT reaction was spotted on a piece of filter paper and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. After boiling the filters in 5% trichloroacetic acid, the filters were washed sequentially with ethanol and acetone and then dried. The filters were subsequently bleached with 15% hydrogen peroxide, dried, and counted in a scintillation counter. Equivalent molar amounts of samples were loaded from SDS elution of resins based on the amount of [35S]Met incorporated into protein construct in each TnT reaction and the number of methionine residues present in each construct. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blotting and autoradiography. The membranes were stained lightly with Coomassie Blue to visualize protein patterns and the molecular weight markers, dried and exposed to film to determine presence and pattern of radioactively labeled protein bands, and then cut according to molecular weight markers for probing with the appropriate anti-chaperone antibodies. Immunoadsorption of each target kinase construct was confirmed by autoradiography (not shown in the figures).

Although the kinase domains of Src family kinases retain the ability to bind Hsp90, the possibility that Hsp90 may have additional interactions with the N-terminal domains of this kinase family (i.e. the unique N-terminal, SH3, and SH2 domains) has not been investigated. Therefore, N-terminally His-tagged full-length Lck, the N-terminal domains of Lck (NT-SH3-SH2), the Lck kinase catalytic domain (Cat), and the NL and C-terminal lobe of the catalytic domain that contained the sequences that links the two lobes (linker-CL) were cloned and expressed by coupled transcriptional/translation in nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysate. The domains were then immunoadsorbed with anti-His tag antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for co-adsorbing chaperones. Consistent with previous findings (24Scroggins B.T. Prince T. Shao J. Uma S. Huang W. Guo Y. Yun B.G. Hedman K. Matts R.L. Hartson S.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12550-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), full-length Lck and the catalytic domain of Lck formed salt-stable complexes with Hsp90 and Cdc37 independent of the presence of molybdate (Fig. 2). Hsp90 and Cdc37 also co-adsorbed with the NL construct of Lck, but molybdate was required to stabilize their interactions. Hsp90, but not Cdc37, interacted with the CL-linker construct of Lck, and molybdate was also required to stabilize this interaction to washing with high salt buffer. No Hsp90 or Cdc37 was found to co-adsorb with the NT-domains of Lck (NT-SH3-SH2) in the presence or absence of molybdate. Thus, the interaction of Hsp90 and Cdc37 with Lck was confined to its catalytic domain, and, as we have previously observed, the interaction of Cdc37 was localized to the NL of Lck (24Scroggins B.T.

Definition of the Minimal Motifs within the CL of the Catalytic Domain of Lck Required for Molybdate-independent High Affinity Binding of Hsp90 and Cdc37—To further delineate the kinase segments that interacted with Hsp90 and Cdc37, we utilized the crystal structure of the kinase domain of Lck as a guide to express constructs from which conserved kinase sequence motifs were deleted from the C-terminal lobe of the kinase (Fig. 3). The Lck constructs containing the NL and deletions that terminated the catalytic domain just after the “APE box” (motif VIII, N-APE), the conserved DFG residues (motif VII, NL-β7/8), and the conserved HRDL(K/R)XXN residues (motif VIb, NL-β7) formed complexes with Hsp90 and Cdc37 that were stable in high salt in the absence of molybdate, and the binding occurred at levels that were nearly equivalent to the binding of the catalytic domain (Fig. 3A). The Lck construct that contained the NL and sequences from the linker region terminating with the α-d-helix that connects the two kinase lobes (motif V, NL-linker) showed a very weak salt stable interaction with Hsp90 and Cdc37, which was markedly enhance in the presence of molybdate. Although again as shown in Fig. 2, Hsp90 and Cdc37 co-adsorbed with the NL but only in the presence of molybdate. To more finely characterize sequences within the C-terminal kinase lobe of Lck that were required to trigger the high affinity binding of Hsp90 and Cdc37, two more constructs containing the NL and a portion of the CL were constructed: an NL with a deletion terminating prior to the catalytic Asp residue contained in motif VIb (NL-αE-Cap) and an NL with a deletion terminating at the end of the αE-helix that lacks the three amino acids that cap the C-terminal end of this helix (equivalent to the β-6 sheet in the nomenclature for the cAMP-activated protein kinase (44Hanks S.K.

Here, we report the effects of the osmolytes, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and sarcosine on the stability of the native state of barstar as well as on the structural heterogeneity of an early intermediate ensemble, IE, on its folding pathway. Both osmolytes increase the stability of the native protein to a similar extent, with stability increasing linearly with osmolyte concentration. Both osmolytes also increase the stability of IE but to different extents. Such stabilization leads to an acceleration in the folding rate. Both osmolytes also alter the structure of IE but do so differentially; the fluorescence and circular dichroism properties of IE differ in the presence of the different osmolytes. Because these properties also differ from those of the unfolded form in refolding conditions, different burst phase changes in the optical signals are seen for folding in the presence of the different osmolytes. An analysis of the urea dependence of the burst phase changes in fluorescence and circular dichroism demonstrates that the formation of IE is itself a multistep process during folding and that the two osmolytes act by stabilizing, differentially, different structural components present in the IE ensemble. Thus, osmolytes can alter the basic nature of a protein folding pathway by discriminating, through differential stabilization, between different members of an early intermediate ensemble, and in doing so, they thereby appear to channel folding along one route when many routes are available.

The unfavorable interaction of the osmolyte with the peptide backbone causes the preferential exclusion of the osmolyte from the protein-water interface, and it dominates over any favorable interaction of the osmolyte with the side chains of amino acids of the protein (8Liu Y. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12884-12891Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 9Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Osmolytes can also induce the folding of proteins, which are otherwise unfolded. For example, in the presence of the osmolyte TMAO, 1The abbreviation used is: TMAO, trimethylamine-N-oxide. reduced carboxyamidated RNase T1 and the destabilized T62P mutant of staphylococcal nuclease A, whose unfolded ensembles dominate in native buffers, are forced to fold into forms that are native-like in their secondary and tertiary structural contents (10Baskakov I. Bolen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4831-4834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). TMAO has also been shown to induce structure in α-synuclein, which is unstructured in its absence (11Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus, osmolytes can not only stabilize folded proteins, but they also appear to be capable of stabilizing the more structured members in an ensemble of disordered protein molecules. It is therefore surprising that very little is known about whether and how osmolytes can affect events on protein folding pathways on which less structured intermediates transform progressively into more structured and stabilized forms. Osmolytes can be expected to perturb not only the transitions between intermediates that differ in stability (12Russo A.T. Rosgen J. Bolen D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 851-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Melo E.P. Chen L. Cabral J.M. Fojan P. Petersen S.B. Otzen D.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7611-7617Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) but also to perturb the equilibria between the differently structured components that may be members of an intermediate ensemble. Such effects of osmolytes on protein folding pathways have become important to study, because recent studies of the products of the submillisecond folding reactions of several proteins, including barstar (14Shastry M.C.R.

Because structural heterogeneity is likely to be a consequence of the availability of multiple folding routes, these results suggest that only a few, and not many (22Dill K.A. Chan H.S. Nat. Struct.

It is of great interest to determine whether different protein folding pathways predominate in the presence of different osmolytes, because this will imply that the folding pathways utilized in the cell depend on the conditions present within it. The 89-amino acid residue, single domain protein barstar is the intracellular inhibitor of the extracellular ribonuclease, barnase in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The folding mechanism of barstar has been characterized in detail (14Shastry M.C.R. Udgaonkar J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Pradeep L. Udgaonkar J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 331-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 31Shastry M.C.R. Agashe V.R. Udgaonkar J.B.

Shastry M.C.R. Udgaonkar J.B. Nature. 1995; 377: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Under strongly stabilizing conditions, the folding of barstar can be represented as follows: U↔KUIIE→kIL→slowNSCHEME 1 IE represents an early intermediate that is populated at a few milliseconds of folding and that equilibrates with U prior to the major structural transition to IL, a late intermediate. Earlier studies had indicated that IE is compact and possesses solvent-exposed hydrophobic patches (14Shastry M.C.R. Udgaonkar J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In marginally stabilizing conditions (1–1.2 m guanidine HCl), no specific structure is found to form at a few milliseconds of folding, suggesting either that IE was devoid of specific structure (33Agashe V.R. Shastry M.C.R. Udgaonkar J.B. Nature. 1995; 377: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) or that IE does not accumulate significantly under these folding conditions. There is strong evidence for structural heterogeneity in IE, from several studies. In the first of these studies, which was the first demonstration of structural heterogeneity in the folding intermediate of any protein, IE was shown to comprise of at least two structural components that form on competing folding pathways from the same population of U molecules (14Shastry M.C.R. Udgaonkar J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). More recent studies indicate that IE is an ensemble of at least three different structural forms, each of which is stabilized differentially, and hence populated differentially, in the absence and presence of salts (20Pradeep L. Udgaonkar J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 331-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). IL also shows structural heterogeneity (34Bhuyan A.K. Udgaonkar J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9158-9168Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Most recently, the use of a multisite time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer approach has shown that the extent of structural heterogeneity depends on how stable the folding conditions are and that different structural components predominate in IL under different folding conditions (35Sridevi K. Lakshmikanth G. Krishnamoorthy G. Udgaonkar J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Obviously, barstar is a good model system for exploring the effects of osmolytes on the structural heterogeneity that now appears characteristic of protein folding reactions. In this study, fluorescence and circular dichroism have been used to study the effects of osmolytes on the stability of the native state and on the heterogeneity of the protein folding reactions. It is seen that the free energy of unfolding of the N state of barstar to the U form has a linear dependence on TMAO as well as on sarcosine concentration, suggesting that the mechanism of stabilization by both osmolytes primarily involves their preferential exclusion from the protein surface. Next, it is shown that the structure of the early intermediate ensemble, IE, is altered, significantly and differentially, in the presence of 1 m TMAO and sarcosine. The heterogeneity in IE has been characterized, and it is shown that the two osmolytes, TMAO and sarcosine, differentially stabilize structure in IE by shifting the equilibrium between different structural components to favor the more structured components. Finally the use of osmolytes has led to a better understanding of the folding pathway of barstar; the transition from the unfolded protein in refolding conditions to IE, is shown to occur through more than one step in the presence of the osmolytes. The Escherichia coli strain MM294 was used for protein expression. The expression plasmid for wild-type barstar was pMT316. The method used to purify barstar has been described in detail (36Khurana R. Udgaonkar J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were calculated using an extinction coefficient of 23,000 m–1 cm–1 (36Khurana R. Udgaonkar J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Mass spectroscopy using a Micromass Q-TOF Ultima showed that the protein was pure and had a mass of 10342, which indicated that the N-terminal methionine residue had remained uncleaved during synthesis. 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) (ultrapure, 99.9% from Invitrogen), 250 μm EDTA (disodium salt, dihydrate, 99+% from Sigma), and 250 μm dithiothreitol (ultrapure from Invitrogen) constituted the native buffer used for all equilibrium and kinetic experiments. Unfolding buffer was native buffer containing 9 to 10 m urea (ultrapure, 99.9% from United States Biochemical). The concentrations of stock solutions of urea were determined by measuring the refractive index using an Abbe 3L refractometer from Milton Roy. For folding studies in the presence of osmolyte (TMAO or sarcosine), the osmolyte was present in the refolding as well as in the unfolding buffer. The unfolding buffers containing 1 m TMAO (dihydrate, ultrapure from Sigma) or 1 m sarcosine (ultrapure from Sigma) had a maximum urea concentration of 9 m, because of solubility limitations. All of the buffers and solutions were filtered through 0.22-μm filters before use and were degassed prior to the kinetic experiments. CD spectra were collected on a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter, using a bandwidth of 1 nm, a response time of 1 s, and a scan speed of 50 nm/min. Each spectrum was an average of three scans monitored between 210 and 250 nm. The protein concentration used was typically10–15 μm for the far-UV CD experiments, and the path length of the cuvette was 0.2 cm. Fluorescence spectra were collected on a SPEX DM 3000 spectrofluorimeter. The protein was excited at 295 nm, and the emission was monitored between 300 and 400 nm with a bandwidth of 0.37 nm for excitation and 10 nm for emission. Each spectrum was an average of three scans. The protein concentration was typically 2–4 μm, and the path length of the cuvette used was 1 cm. Protein stability at equilibrium was determined by urea-induced denaturation studies using two probes. The CD at 222 nm and fluorescence at 320 nm were monitored as described above. Prior to the CD and fluorescence measurements, the samples were equilibrated for at least 4 h. Identical results were obtained if the time of incubation was 24 h. Kinetic experiments were performed on a Biologic SFM-4 stopped-flow mixing module. Folding was monitored using either intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence at 320 nm or far-UV CD at 222 nm as the probe. Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Measurements—For intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements, the excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm, and emission was monitored at 320 nm using an Oriel bandpass filter with a bandwidth of 10 nm. The protein concentration during refolding was between 15 and 30 μm. In all experiments, an FC-08 cuvette with a path length of 0.8 mm was used, the total flow rate was 6.0 ml/s, and the dead time of the instrument was 1.5 ms. For refolding experiments, barstar was unfolded in 9 m urea (unfolding buffer) for at least 4 h (the unfolding buffer contained TMAO or sarcosine when refolding was studied in the presence of osmolyte). In refolding experiments, the final concentration of urea was between 0.9 and 2.7 m in the absence of osmolyte and between 0.9 and 4.5 m in the presence of 1 m TMAO or 1 m sarcosine. Far-UV CD Measurements—For far-UV CD measurements, a polarizer/modulator assembly was installed on the Biologic SFM-4 stopped-flow mixing module. A photomultiplier and its controller (model PMS 400) was used to collect data in the CD mode. A test experiment was performed to check the performance of the CD recording system for proper alignment of the optics and the polarizer/modulator assembly, in which the alkaline hydrolysis of glucuronolactone at 225 nm was studied. For all of the kinetic studies on the folding of barstar, the wave-length was set to 222 nm, and the retardation was set to ¼ wavelength. The protein concentration during refolding was between 15 and 25 μm; the upper limit was decided based on a pilot experiment, wherein linearity in the CD signal was found to be lost at concentrations above 25 μm. In all experiments, an FC-20 cuvette with a path length of 2.0 mm was used, the total flow rate was 6.0 ml/s, and the dead time was 9.0 ms. For refolding experiments, barstar was unfolded in 9 m urea (unfolding buffer) for at least 4 h (the unfolding buffer contained TMAO or sarcosine when refolding was studied in the presence of osmolyte). In refolding experiments, the final concentration of urea was between 0.9 and 2.7 m in the absence of osmolyte and between 0.9 and 4.5 m in the presence of 1 m TMAO or 1 m sarcosine. The kinetics on this module could be collected only for 20 s because of bleaching. Far-UV CD kinetics for longer time periods were collected manually on a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter, using a bandwidth of 1 nm, a response time of 1 s, and a sensitivity of 50 millidegrees. Each kinetic trace was an average of three kinetic runs at 222 nm. The protein concentration used was typically 15–25 μm for the far-UV CD experiments, the path length of the cuvette was 2.0 mm, and the dead time for manual kinetics was 20 s. Equilibrium Studies—According to the weak interaction (linear free energy) model for describing the interaction of urea (D) with a protein (7Schellman J.A. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 37: 121-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 37Schellman J.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 115-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), the change in free energy, ΔG/, that occurs upon unfolding of any form of a protein, j, in the presence of D, is linearly dependent on denaturant concentration, [D]. ΔGUj′=ΔGUj+mUj[D](Eq. 1) mUj is the change in free energy associated with the preferential interaction of the denaturant with the unfolded form, U, relative to the folded (partially or fully) form, j. When the form j is a partially folded intermediate I, ΔGUI/, represents the free energy of unfolding of I, and when j is the native state, N, ΔGUN/ represents the free energy of unfolding of N in the presence of denaturant. ΔGUj represents the free energy of unfolding of the folded (partially or fully) form j to U in the absence of any denaturant or added co-solute. An osmolyte, O, acting as a chemical perturbant, also interacts with a protein according to the weak interaction model (38Timasheff S.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 355-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the free energy of unfolding of a folded form j to U, in the presence of O, has a linear dependence on osmolyte concentration, [O]. ΔGUj//=ΔGUj+mOj[O](Eq. 2) mOj is the change in free energy associated with the preferential interaction of the osmolyte with the unfolded form, U, relative to the folded (partially or fully) form, j. According to Equation 2, mOj has a positive value when the folded form is stabilized in the presence of osmolyte. When the form j is a partially folded intermediate I, ΔGUI//, represents the free energy of stabilization of I, and when j is the native state, N, ΔGUN// represents the free energy of stabilization of N, in the presence of osmolyte. Thus, in the presence of both denaturant and osmolyte, the free energy of unfolding of a folded form, j to the unfolded form U, ΔGUj/// is given by the following. ΔGUj///=ΔGUj+mOj[O]+mUj[D](Eq. 3) Equation 3 assumes that mUj is independent of [O] and that mOj is independent of [D]. The equilibrium data for the unfolding of N as a function of [D], obtained in the presence of a fixed concentration of osmolyte, were fit to a two-state U [rlhar2] N model according to the following equation, YO=YN+mN[D]+(YU+mU[D])e−(ΔGUN//+mUN[D])RT1+e−(ΔGUN//+mUN[D])RT(Eq. 4) where YO is the value of the spectroscopic property being measured as a function of [D] at fixed [O], YN and YU represents the intercepts, and mN and mU represent the slopes of the native protein and unfolded protein base lines, respectively. Thus, fits of denaturant-induced equilibrium unfolding data at different fixed values of [O] to Equation 4 yield values for ΔGUN// and mUN at each fixed [O], and a subsequent fit of the osmolyte dependence of ΔGUN// to Equation 2 yields values for ΔGUN and mON. Raw equilibrium unfolding data of N as a function of [D] were also analyzed in an alternative way (39Agashe V.R. Udgaonkar J.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3286-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). They were first converted to plots of fraction unfolded (fU) versus [D], using Equation 5. fU=YO−(YN+mN[D])(YU+mU[D])−(YN+mN[D])(Eq. 5) The fU values were then fit to Equation 6. fU=e−(ΔGUN//+mUN[D])RT1+e−(ΔGUN//+mUN[D])RT(Eq. 6) In Equation 6, ƒU is related to ΔGUN// by a transformation of the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation in which the equilibrium constant for unfolding in the transition zone, KUN///, is given by KUN///=fU/(1−fU), for a two-state transition. The concentration of the denaturant at which the protein is half unfolded (when ΔGUj/=0), is given by Cm and from Equation 1, Cm = ΔGUj/mUj. Kinetic Studies—The observable kinetics of folding of barstar in the pretransition zone are described by a three-exponential process when monitored by fluorescence at 320 nm: A(t)=A(∞)−A1e−λ1t−A1e−λ2t−A1e−λ3t(Eq. 7) where A(t) and A(∞) are the observed reduced amplitudes at times t and at infinity; λ1, λ2 and λ3 are the apparent rate constants of the slow, fast and intermediate phases, and A1, A2 and A3 are the respective amplitudes. The relative amplitude of each phase was determined by dividing the observed amplitude of that phase by the equilibrium amplitude of the reaction at that urea concentration. In the transition zone, the folding process is two-exponential and is described by Equation 7, with A3 = 0. The observable kinetics of folding of barstar in the pretransition zone and transition zone are described by a two-exponential process when monitored by CD at 222 nm, A(t)=A(∞)−A1e−λ1t−A1e−λ2t(Eq. 8) or by a single exponential process, by setting A1 equal to zero in Equation 8, at lower urea concentrations in the pretransition zone. In the absence of any osmolyte, for refolding at the lowest urea concentration, i.e. 0.9 m urea, no slow phase was observed; the signal corresponding to that of the N state was achieved in the dead time (20 s) of a manual mixing experiment, and no slow phase is observable in a stopped-flow experiment. For slightly higher urea concentrations (1.5 and 1.8 m), the t = ∞ of the stopped-flow kinetic data coincides with the t = 0 of the manual mixing kinetic data. But for the urea concentrations 2.1, 2.4, and 2.7 m, the t = ∞ of the stopped-flow kinetic data did not coincide with the t = 0 of the manual mixing kinetic data. That is, at higher concentrations of urea, there was a 5–14% discrepancy between the equilibrium folding amplitude and amplitude of the observable kinetic phases and the burst phase. Likewise, in the presence of either osmolyte, only the fast phase of refolding was observed at urea concentrations below 2.7 m. At higher urea concentrations, the t = ∞ from the stopped-flow measurements again did not coincide with the t = 0ofthe manual mixing experiments, with there being a maximum discrepancy of up to 10% in amplitudes. The discrepancy was possibly due to the contribution of linear dichroism (arising from pressure on the cuvette) to the observed protein signal, which probably is also responsible for the 2–3-millidegree discrepancy observed between the signal of unfolded protein (9 m urea) measured on the Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter and on the Biologic SFM 4. Thus, there is about a 10–15% error in the data of the amplitudes at the higher concentrations of urea used. To analyze kinetic data according to Scheme 1, it was assumed that the conformational transitions between U, UC, and IE are rapid compared with the subsequent slow conversion of IE to IL and N, so that a transient pre-equilibrium, characterized by the equilibrium constant, KUI, is established between UC and IE. To determine whether the transition between two UC and IE is two-state, the pre-equilibrium data for the denaturant-induced unfolding of IE, obtained from kinetic experiments in the presence of a fixed concentration of osmolyte, O, as well as the pre-equilibrium data for the osmolyte-induced stabilization of IE at a fixed concentration of denaturant, were fit to a two-state model according to the following equation, Y=YI+mI[X]+(YU+mU[X])e−(ΔGUI+mUI[D]+mOj[O])RT1+e−(ΔGUI+mUI[D]+moj[O]))RT(Eq. 9) where [X] is the variable [D] for experiments in which refolding is carried out at a fixed value of [O], and [X] is the variable [O] for experiments in which refolding is carried out at a fixed [D]. Y is the value of the spectroscopic property being measured as a function of the variable [X], YI and YU represent the intercepts, and mI and mU represent the slopes of the IE and UC base lines, respectively. The dependence of the rate constant, k, for the conversion of IE to IL or N (Scheme 1) is expected to decrease exponentially with an increase in [D], because the free energy of activation is expected to increase linearly with an increase in [D]. Also, k is expected to increase exponentially with an increase in [O], because the free energy of activation is assumed to decrease linearly with an increase in [O]. This is given by the following equation, k=k°e−mkD[D]emko[O](Eq. 10) where ko is the rate constant in the absence of denaturant and osmolyte, RTmkD is the free energy associated with the preferential interaction of denaturant with the transition state relative to IE, and RTmkO is the free energy associated with the preferential interaction of osmolye with the transition state relative to IE. Then the observed rate of folding, λ///, in the presence of both urea at concentration [D] and osmolyte at concentration [O], is given by the"

Like all other NPs, NP4 requires a ferric heme to function as an NO-binding protein. Reduction of the heme iron will cause nearly irreversible binding of NO. In the absence of NO, NP4 has a spacious distal pocket that allows easy solvent access (12Roberts S.A. Weichsel A. Qiu Y. Shelnutt J.A. Walker F.A. Montfort W.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11327-11337Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Upon NO binding, two loops, the A-B loop (residues 31–37) and the G-H loop (residues 125–132) pack tightly around the NO ligand and form a hydrophobic trap (13Weichsel A. Andersen J.F. Roberts S.A. Montfort W.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The trapping mechanism utilizes the pH sensitivity of the protein conformation. At pH 5, the approximate pH of the insect saliva, the “closed” conformation is stabilized for the NO complex, whereas at pH 7, the approximate pH of the victim's tissue, the closed conformation is destabilized (2Andersen J.F.

Shepley D. Montfort W.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6679-6690Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The kinetics of NO binding and release by NP4 are multiphasic (2Andersen J.F. Ding X.D.

In contrast to x-ray diffraction, infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a very sensitive tool for studying structural heterogeneity in heme proteins. In most studies, carbon monoxide (CO) has served as probe molecule because of its strong IR absorbance bands in the heme-bound form and when it is trapped within the protein matrix (15Nienhaus K.

The CO stretching frequency is finely tuned by its immediate environment, mainly through Stark effects of the local electric field acting on the CO dipole (19Kriegl J.M. Nienhaus K. Deng P. Fuchs J.

In this work, we have investigated ligand binding and possible migration in NP4 with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. We have begun our studies with CO to exploit its superb properties as an IR marker and then extended them to NO, the physiologically relevant ligand of ferric NP4. Recent work on myoglobin has stressed the significance of its hydrophobic cavities, the so-called “xenon cavities” named after their ability to bind xenon (27Tilton Jr., R.F. Kuntz Jr., I.D. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Two of them were shown to play important roles as transient docking sites for ligands migrating through the protein matrix (17Nienhaus K. Deng P. Kriegl J.M. Nienhaus G.U.

To identify internal docking sites in NP4, we have determined the x-ray structure of NP4 at 100 K in the presence of xenon. Two xenon binding cavities were identified. The IR data show, however, that these sites are not significantly accessed by photodissociated ligands at a low temperature. Sample Preparation—Recombinant NP4 protein was isolated and renatured from inclusion bodies in an overexpressing strain of Escherichia coli, as described previously (11Andersen J.F. Weichsel A. Balfour C.A. Champagne D.E. Montfort W.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1315-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 31Andersen J.F. Champagne D.E. Weichsel A. Ribeiro J.M. Balfour C.A. Dress V. Montfort W.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4423-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To obtain CO-ligated samples, a ∼10 mm protein solution was prepared in glycerol and 1 m potassium phosphate buffer cryosolvent (3:1 by volume). The solution was equilibrated with 1 atm of CO for 1 h. A 2-fold molar excess of sodium dithionite was added anaerobically before stirring for another 15 min under CO atmosphere. To remove any protein aggregates, the sample solution was centrifuged prior to loading it into the sample cell. For NO-ligated samples, the protein in the cryosolvent was thoroughly deaerated with nitrogen and equilibrated with NO for 15 min. FTIR Spectroscopy—A few microliters of the protein solution were kept between two CaF2 windows (diameter 25.4 mm) separated by a 75-μm-thick mylar washer and mounted inside a block of oxygen-free high conductivity copper on the cold finger of a closed cycle helium refrigerator (model SRDK-205AW; Sumitomo, Tokyo, Japan). The sample temperature was measured with a silicon temperature sensor diode and adjusted between 3 and 320 K using a digital temperature controller (model 330; Lake Shore Cryotronics, Westerville, OH). A continuous wave, frequency-doubled neodymium-YAG laser (model Forte 530-300; Laser Quantum, Manchester, UK) emitting 300 milliwatts of output power at 532 nm was used to photolyze the sample at a photolysis rate of kL ≈ 20 s–1. The laser beam was split and focused with lenses on both sides of the sample. Transmission spectra were collected on an IFS 66v/S spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) in the mid-infrared between 1800 and 2400 cm–1 at a resolution of 2 cm–1. To investigate the temperature dependence of ligand binding, we used temperature-derivative spectroscopy (TDS), a technique designed to study thermally activated rate processes (23Mourant J.R. Braunstein D.P. Chu K. Frauenfelder H. Nienhaus G.U. Ormos P. Young R.D. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1496-1507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 32Berendzen J. Braunstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Nienhaus G.U. Mourant J.R. Chu K. Frauenfelder H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13413-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Whereas the technique is routinely used to study CO association to heme proteins, it has been applied for the first time to NO. Briefly, ligands are trapped selectively at intermediate docking sites within the protein matrix by photodissociation at particular temperatures. Subsequently, as the sample temperature is slowly ramped up linearly in time, FTIR transmission spectra are taken continuously, one spectrum for each kelvin temperature increase. Absorbance difference spectra are calculated from transmission spectra at successive temperatures. TDS data are conveniently presented as logarithmically scaled contour plots of the absorbance change on a surface spanned by the wavenumber and temperature axes. Three different illumination protocols have been employed. Illumination for 1 s at 3 K ensures that each protein absorbs at least one photon. At this low temperature, photolyzed ligands are normally trapped in the primary docking site. Detailed studies of photoproduct states in MbCO have shown that extended illumination, especially at higher temperatures, is a means to drive ligands into more remote sites where they encounter higher overall enthalpy barriers against recombination (33Nienhaus G.U. Mourant J.R. Chu K. Frauenfelder H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13413-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To examine if secondary docking sites also exist in NP4, the samples were cooled under illumination from 160 to 3K at a rate of 5 mK/s. In a third experiment, the samples were illuminated at 185 K for 2 h and subsequently cooled under light to 140 K at 5 mK/s. This procedure is designed to create photoproduct intermediates above the glass transition temperature of the cryosolvent (∼175 K). In this temperature range, large scale protein motions are possible so that the protein may switch to another conformation with entirely different ligand binding properties. Crystallography—Crystals of NP4 were grown from hanging drops, pH 7.5, using ammonium phosphate as a precipitant as described previously (11Andersen J.F. Weichsel A. Balfour C.A. Champagne D.E. Montfort W.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1315-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Xenon gas was added to a crystal under pressure using a xenon chamber (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were measured at 100 K to 1.45 Å resolution on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV2+ image plate detector associated with a copper rotating anode x-ray source and Osmic mirrors. Data were processed with d*TREK (34Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Temperature Dependence of FTIR Spectra—Fig. 1 shows FTIR absorbance spectra of NP4CO and NP4NO at pH 7.5 as a function of temperature. Below ∼160 K, the spectra remain essentially unchanged (data not shown). Between 160 and 200 K, a slight shift toward a lower wavenumber and a loss of absorbance with increasing temperatures is observed for both samples. For NP4CO, the integrated absorbance is essentially constant between 200 and 290 K, whereas the rather broad band shifts from 1963 to 1960 cm–1. By contrast, the spectra of NP4NO show a much stronger temperature dependence. The band at 1908 cm–1 (A1908) 4We use the frequencies at 3K as a subscript to A (heme-bound state) and B (photoproduct state) to denote the absorbance bands. loses almost 50% of its intensity, whereas that of A1922 hardly changes. Both bands shift to the red with increasing temperature. FTIR Photolysis Difference Spectra—Difference spectra were calculated from transmission spectra collected before and after photolysis using the different illumination protocols (Fig. 2). The experiments were initially performed on the NP4CO complex because a lot of spectroscopic data are available on hemebound and photodissociated CO in globins, which may aid in NP4NO data interpretation. Moreover, comparison of CO and NO could yield insights into the functional properties specific to NO. The negative features in Fig. 2 represent ligands dissociated from the heme-bound state; the less intense, positive bands are due to photolyzed ligands trapped at specific sites within the protein matrix. For comparison, the spectra of the overall heme-bound ligands at 3 K are also included (Fig. 2, dashed lines). All peak positions are compiled in Table II. After a 1-s illumination at 3 K, the absorbance difference spectrum shows a majority band of heme-bound CO at 1963 cm–1; additional bands can be discerned at 1939, 1953, and 1972 cm–1. Only ∼45% of the ligands can be trapped at photoproduct sites in the time it takes to collect an FTIR spectrum (∼100 s). The photodissociated ligands give rise to much less intense bands as compared with those of the heme-bound CO, the ratio of the integrated absorbances being 26. There are two bands at 2123 and 2151 cm–1; weaker bands are visible at 2116, 2130, and 2137 cm–1. At pH 6.1 (Fig. 2a, gray solid lines), the minority bands on the red side of the peak at 1963 cm–1 are smaller. A larger fraction of photodissociated CO is trapped in B2151; B2130 has also gained population so that it is much more apparent among the other photoproduct bands. By using our extended illumination protocol with slow cooling from 160 to 3 K, especially the bands of heme-bound CO at 1953 and 1963 cm–1 have gained intensity; in the photoproduct region, the bands at 2123 and 2130 cm–1 have increased. The larger overall spectral area reflects a higher yield of long-lived photoproduct (∼55%). Upon illumination at 185 K, only a small fraction of ligands (∼10%) were kept photolyzed (dashed-dotted lines in Fig. 2a), giving rise to photoproduct bands at 2128 and 2134 cm–1, which may be identical to the bands found at 2130 and 2137 cm–1 at 3 K.Table IIStretching frequencies of NP4CO and NP4NO determined at 3 K after 1 s and extended photolysis illuminationvC-O (heme-bound ligand)aValues in parentheses refer to 1-s illumination.vC-O (photolyzed ligand)1-s illuminationSlow cooling from 160 to 3 Kcm-1cm-1NP4CO1939 (7)2116 (14)2116 (10)pH 7.51953 (30)2123 (50)2123 (53)1963 (50)2130 (23)2130 (27)1972 (13)2137 (4)2137 (3)2151 (9)2151 (7)NP4CO1949 (14)2116 (7)2116 (4)pH 6.11963 (75)2123 (33)2123 (37)1974 (11)2130 (20)2130 (22)2137 (4)2137 (3)2151 (36)2151 (34)NP4NO1908 (74)1858 (63)1858 (47)pH 7.51922 (26)1865 (22)1864 (32)1869 (15)1868 (21)a Values in parentheses refer to 1-s illumination. Open table in a new tab Fig. 2b shows the corresponding photolysis difference spectra of the NO stretching bands. NO-ligated NP4 at pH 7.5 displays only two absorbance bands (Fig. 2b, dashed line), a large band at 1908 cm–1, and a smaller one at 1922 cm–1. The population ratio is pH-dependent; at higher pH the band at 1922 cm–1 dominates the spectrum (data not shown). After a brief illumination at 3 K (Fig. 2b, solid line), the spectrum shows that altogether ∼60% of all heme-bound ligands are photolyzed after a 1-s illumination, with ∼80% of NO ligands from molecules in conformation A1922 and ∼55% of the ligands in A1908. The corresponding photoproduct bands are found at 1858, 1865, and 1869 cm–1. The ratio of integrated absorbances of NO in the bound and photolyzed states is 66, much larger than for CO. The spectrum after slow cooling under illumination from 160 to 3 K (dotted line) shows slightly more photodissociated ligands (68%), with the increase predominantly in A1922. The photoproduct band B1864 has markedly gained intensity, whereas the fraction of NO ligands at photoproduct site B1858 has decreased slightly. At 185 K, the generation of long-lived photoproducts is essentially restricted to heme-bound state A1922, and only a single, rather broad photoproduct band centered at 1864 cm–1 is visible. TDS Studies—To examine ligand binding as a function of temperature, TDS experiments were performed subsequent to the three illumination protocols described above. After 1-s illumination, recombination is already significant at 3 K for both NO and CO ligands, peaks at 15 and 12 K, respectively, and is completed by ∼45 K (Fig. 3, a and c). If the samples are cooled under light (Fig. 3, e and g), rebinding extends out to ∼70 K. However, the effect is overemphasized by the logarithmic scaling of the contours. Indeed, the fraction of CO and NO ligands rebinding at higher temperatures is very small, as can be inferred from the integrated absorbance differences plotted in Fig. 4, which were calculated from the TDS data in Fig. 3. For comparison, TDS data of the MbCO mutant H64L are also included. 5K. Nienhaus and G. U. Nienhaus, unpublished data. This mutant shows maximum rebinding at ∼38 K after a 1-s illumination; >50% of all photolyzed ligands can be trapped at a secondary site after slow cooling under illumination, from where they rebind at ∼70 K.Fig. 4Integrated absorbance differences for NP4NO (top) and NP4CO (bottom) calculated from the TDS data inFig. 3.

Ligands from the other photoproduct states rebind at slightly lower temperatures. CO ligands trapped in state B2124 also rebind at 15 K (Fig. 3, d and h), whereas recombination from intermediate B2151 is already maximal at ∼5 K. Because of the low fractions of ligands rebinding above ∼40 K, we were unable to resolve the corresponding photoproduct bands. Fig. 5 shows contour maps after extended illumination at higher temperatures. For both NO and CO, recombination peaks are present at ∼200 K. Rebinding in NP4CO extends from 170 to 215 K. Ligands return from two photoproduct states with bands at 2128 and 2134 cm–1. Contours of NP4NO are seen between 180 and 225 K.

To investigate whether analogous pockets exist in NP4, we have measured diffraction data from an NP4 crystal (pH 7.4) after the introduction of xenon gas from which a major and a minor xenon pocket were found. The anomalous difference electron density map, which indicates atoms that diffract anomalously because of the absorption of x-rays, displayed three peaks. Peak 1 (36 σ) was located on the proximal side of the heme in a cavity typically occupied by a water molecule (Fig. 6). Peak 2 (9 σ) was located on the distal side of the heme in steric conflict with the side chain of Leu-130. The third peak (30 σ) was centered on the heme iron. A difference electron density map calculated with a model determined without xenon gas displayed strong peaks at positions corresponding to anomalous peaks 1 and 2 (50 and 14 σ, respectively). Based on these observations, a fully occupied xenon atom (Xe1) was modeled at position one, and a partially occupied xenon atom (Xe2) was modeled at position 2 (occupancy = 0.3). Leu-130 is part of the G-H loop that undergoes a substantial change in conformation when NP4 binds NO or CO, particularly at low pH. The side chain of Leu-130 in the present structure (pH 7.4, NH3 bound to heme) is clearly defined in the electron density map but displays a distinct second conformation, which relieves the steric conflict with Xe2 and was modeled with the same occupancy as Xe2 (0.3). This alternate conformation for Leu-130 is not observed in the structure of NP4NH3, determined to the much higher resolu"

X-ray Multimirror Mission-Newton observations of the Geminga pulsar show a 43-electron volt spectrum from the whole neutron star surface, as well as a power-law component above 2 kiloelectron volts. In addition, we have detected a hot (170 electron volts) thermal emission from an approximately 60-meter-radius spot on the pulsar's surface. Such a thermal emission, only visible at selected phase intervals, may be coming from polar hot spot(s), long thought to exist as a result of heating from magnetospheric accelerated particles. It may provide the missing link between the x-ray and gamma-ray emission of the pulsar."

The thujones are hydroxylated by these enzymes at various positions, but oxidation at C-4 gives rise to both rearranged and unrearranged hydroxylation products. Rearranged products result from the formation of a radical intermediate that can undergo either inversion of stereochemistry or ring opening of the adjacent cyclopropane ring. Both of these rearrangements, as well as a C-4 desaturation reaction, are observed. The ring opening clock gives oxygen rebound rates that range from 0.2 × 1010 to 2.8 × 1010 s–1 for the different substrate and enzyme combinations. The C-4 inversion reaction provides independent confirmation of a radical intermediate. The phenol product expected if a C-4 cationic rather than radical intermediate is formed is not detected. The results are consistent with a two-state process and provide support for a radical rebound but not a hydroperoxide insertion mechanism for cytochrome P-450 hydroxylation. α-Thujone (1α) and β-thujone (1β) were used to investigate the mechanism of hydrocarbon hydroxylation by cytochromes P-450cam (CYP101) and P-450BM3 (CYP102).

Cytochrome P-450 enzymes catalyze a diversity of oxidations, including reactions such as the hydroxylation of hydrocarbons with high intrinsic activation barriers. A number of experimental observations, including (a) high intrinsic isotope effects for the hydroxylation reaction (1Groves J.T. McGlusky G.A. White R.E. Coon M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In this mechanism, the ferryl species (formally Fe(V) = O) formed by cytochrome P-450-catalyzed activation of molecular oxygen abstracts a hydrogen from the substrate to give a carbon radical intermediate (R•) that recombines with the formal equivalent of an iron-bound hydroxyl radical [Fe(IV)-OH] to give the final alcohol product (Fig. 1) (8Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

Cytochrome P-450: Structure, Function, and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 245-303Google Scholar). Early experiments with radical clock substrates provided persuasive support for an oxygen rebound mechanism. In the first study of this kind, the oxidation of bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane was found to give a ratio of rearranged and unrearranged products that implicated a recombination rate of ∼1010 s–1, and thus a lifetime of 50 ps, for the carbon radical intermediate (10Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Stearns R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 3415-3420Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 11Bowry V.W. Ingold K.U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5699-5707Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments with related radical clock substrates confirmed this initial result for secondary carbon radicals and suggested a somewhat faster rate for primary carbon radicals (12Atkinson J.K. Ingold K.U. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9209-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, as faster and faster radical clocks were examined, conflicting results were obtained, in that the calculated rates for the recombination reaction required by the data were so rapid (in the order of 1012–1013 s–1) that the existence of a true carbon radical intermediate became questionable (13Newcomb M. Shen R. Choi S.-Y. Toy P.T. Hollenberg P.F. Vaz A.D.N. Coon M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2677-2686Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 14Newcomb M. Toy P.H. Acc. Chem.

Soc. 2004; 126: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Rates of this magnitude are more consistent with a transition state rather than an actual intermediate. Furthermore, the subsequent development of probes that can distinguish between radical and cation intermediates suggested that the intermediate might be predominantly a cation rather than a radical and therefore that the oxidizing species might be something altogether different from the ferryl species. One alternative hydroxylating species that has been proposed based on these studies is the ferric hydroperoxide complex [Fe(III)-OOH] preceding the ferryl species in the catalytic activation of oxygen by cytochrome P-450 (13Newcomb M. Shen R. Choi S.-Y. Toy P.T. Hollenberg P.F. Vaz A.D.N. Coon M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2677-2686Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 14Newcomb M. Toy P.H. Acc. Chem.

However, density functional theory calculations predict that this hydroperoxide complex should be a poor hydroxylating agent, and only inferential evidence has been advanced for its involvement (17Ogliaro F. de Visser S.P. Cohen S. Sharma P.K. Shaik S. J. Am. Chem Soc. 2002; 124: 2806-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Recent work with norcarane, spiro[2.5]octane, and cyclopropyl fatty acid radical clocks concurs with the earlier studies implicating a radical mechanism and suggests radical lifetimes that range from 16 to 50 ps (18Auclair K. Hu Z. Little D.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Groves J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 6020-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Cryle M.J. Stuthe J.M.U. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. De Voss J.J. Chem. Commun. 2004; : 512-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although a different interpretation has been independently advanced for the norcarane result (20Newcomb M. Shen R. Lu Y. Coon M.J. Hollenberg P.F. Kopp D.A. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 6879-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Trace amounts of cationic rearrangement products were detected in the norcarane but not in the cyclopropyl fatty acid studies. Analysis of these results suggested that differences in the measured radical lifetimes might reflect steric or electronic differences, because secondary radicals generally give slower apparent recombination rates than primary radicals (18Auclair K. Hu Z. Little D.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Groves J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 6020-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Computational methods brought to bear on this mechanistic conundrum have provided insight into the possible origin of the discrepancies among the experimental results (21Shaik S. Filatov M. Schroder D. Schwarz H. Chem. Eur. J. 1998; 4: 193-199Crossref Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 22Harris N. Cohen S. Filatov M. Ogliaro F. Angew. Chem. Int.

Soc. 2004; 126: 1907-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In particular, density function theory calculations suggest a two-state reactivity paradigm in which hydrogen abstraction yields either a doublet or quartet radical species, depending on which of the two possible spin states of the ferryl complex actually abstracts the hydrogen. The calculations show that the low spin species recombines without a measurable barrier to give the alcohol, whereas the quartet species must overcome an energy barrier and is thus susceptible to competing reactions, such as rearrangements, prior to recombination to give the alcohol. The proportion of the two spin states is sensitive to the environment, so that different extents of doublet and quartet reactions are possible with different enzymes and different substrates. In the case of radical clock substrates, the apparent radical recombination rate will be artificially elevated by the extent of the doublet reaction, because the unrearranged product formed by this pathway will be added to that formed by the quartet reaction, the only one of the two reactions that is in fact relevant to determination of the recombination rate (25Kumar D. de Visser S.P. Sharma P.K. Cohen S. Shaik S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 1907-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The measured recombination rates thus represent the maximum possible rather than necessarily the actual rate, because it assumes that all of the reaction proceeds via the quartet state. The metabolism and biology of α- and β-thujone (1α and 1β, respectively) have been scrutinized because of the putative role of α-thujone in the physiological action of absinthe. Previous studies of α-thujone, which interacts with the γ-aminobutyric acid, type A receptor, have shown that it is quickly metabolized in vitro by mouse liver microsomes (26Hold K.M. Sirisoma N.S. Casida J.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The principal product is 7-hydroxy-α-thujone (8), but five other compounds were found as minor metabolites: 4-hydroxy-α-thujone (3α), 4-hydroxy-β-thujone (3β), two other hydroxythujones, and 7,8-dehydro-α-thujone (12) (26Hold K.M. Sirisoma N.S. Casida J.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Sirisoma N.S. Hold K.M. Casida J.E. J. Agric.

A. 2000; 97: 3826-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2; see also Fig. 5). From a mechanistic point of view, α- and β-thujone are interesting because hydroxylation at C-4 should generate, respectively, the radicals 2α and 2β (or simply 2, if C-4 becomes planar) that can undergo both hydroxylation with inversion of stereochemistry and cyclopropyl ring opening to give a monocyclic alcohol product (Fig. 2). Formation of the two possible 4-hydroxy isomers in the mouse metabolism studies indicates that the stereochemical inversion is feasible, but the reaction was not investigated, and the ring opened product was not reported. In preliminary work, we have chemically generated the C-4 radicals expected from of α- and β-thujone and have investigated their chemistry (29He X. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Org. Chem. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). These studies indicate that when 2α and 2β are chemically generated they undergo cyclopropyl ring opening at rates of 4.4 × 107 and 1.0 × 108 s–1, respectively (29He X. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Org. Chem. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). The stereochemistry of radical quenching in these chemical studies established that the C-4 radical readily undergoes inversion, but quenching of the radical is largely controlled by steric effects that result in delivery of the quenching hydrogen atom almost exclusively from the α-side regardless of whether the radical is initially generated on the α- or β-side. Furthermore, the chemically generated thujone C-4 cation was shown to rapidly rearrange to carvacrol, a phenolic product not observed in the free radical reactions (29He X. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Org. Chem. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar).Fig. 5Products resulting from formation of a radical intermediate upon P-450-catalyzed oxidation of α-thujone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) General Materials—Unless otherwise mentioned, all of the reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich.

All of the chemicals were used without further purification. The UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrometer or a Cary 1E Varian UV-visible spectrometer. GC 1The abbreviations used are: GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; Pd, putidaredoxin. and GC-MS analyses were performed on a Hewlett Packard Model 5890 gas chromatograph with a J&W DB-17 or DB-1 50% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane capillary column. Synthesis—β-Thujone (1β), 4,10-dehydrothujone (11), 4-hydroxy-α-thujone (3α), 4-hydroxy-β-thujone (3β), (4S)-(+)-4-hydroxy-p-menth-1-en-6-one (5), and (4R)-(–)-4-hydroxy-p-menth-1-en-6-one (6) were prepared according to published procedures (30Barton D.H.R. Crich D. Motherwell W.B. Tetrahedron. 1985; 41: 3901-3924Crossref Scopus (636) Google Scholar). As shown by gas chromatography, the β-thujone sample contains 2–3% α-thujone, but this was taken into account in the calculations for the enzymatic studies. The purity of all of the intermediates and products was confirmed by 1H NMR and GC-MS. Enzymes and Binding Assays—P-450cam (CYP101), putidaredoxin (Pd), and putidaredoxin reductase from Pseudomonas putida were expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli and were purified as previously reported (31De Voss J.J. Sibbesen O. Zhang Z. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5489-5498Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The purified proteins containing camphor were flash frozen over dry ice and stored at –70 °C. P-450BM3 was kindly provided by Dr. Karine Auclair. The Ks values for the association of α-thujone and β-thujone with the two different P-450 enzymes were determined by UV spectroscopy. The camphor present in the P-450cam sample was removed using a PD-10 column with 50 mm Tris at pH 7.4 containing 200 mm KCl. The binding assays were performed immediately after P-450cam was buffer-exchanged (P-450cam is unstable to freezing/thawing in the absence of camphor). The increase in the absorbance of the high spin species at 391 nm and the decrease in the absorbance of the low spin species at 416 nm were monitored upon addition of α-thujone. In the case of β-thujone with P-450cam, the increase in the absorbance at 411 nm and the decrease in the absorbance at 416 nm were monitored instead, because the typical increase at 390 nm was not observed. Enzyme Incubations—Unless otherwise indicated, the buffer was 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4. In the case of P-450cam, the incubations contained P-450cam (0.5 μm), Pd (5 μm), Pd reductase (5 μm), α-thujone (2000 μm), superoxide dismutase (2 μm), and catalase (100 μg/ml) in the reaction buffer. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NADH (2000 μm). In the case of P-450BM3, the final incubation contained P-450BM3 (2 μm), superoxide dismutase (2 μm), α-thujone (2000 μm), and NADPH (2000 μm). Control reactions were carried out without enzyme and, separately, without NADPH/NADH. All of the reaction mixtures (500 μl) were incubated at 37 °C in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes for 1 h before being extracted with CH2Cl2 (250 μl × 2). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, concentrated to 100 μl and analyzed by GC and/or GC-MS. Binding of α- and β-Thujone to P-450cam and P-450BM3—The binding affinities of α and β-thujone to P-450cam and P-450BM3 were measured by UV spectroscopy. In most cases, the binding of a substrate to a P-450 enzyme displaces the distal water ligand from the heme iron atom. This event is observed in the ultraviolet spectrum as a decrease in the intensity of the water-ligated absorption maximum at 416 nm and a concomitant increase in the band at 391 nm of the substrate-bound enzyme without a coordinated water molecule (32Schenkman J.B. Sligar S.G. Cinti D.L. Schenkman J.B. Kupfer D. International Encyclopedia of Pharmacology & Therapeutics: Hepatic Cytochrome P-450 Monoxygenase System.

These changes are observed when α-thujone is bound to P-450cam and P-450BM-3 and when β-thujone is bound to P-450BM3. However, when β-thujone binds to P-450cam, the increase at 391 nm is not observed (Fig. 3). Instead the absorption maximum at 416 simply shifts to 412 nm. Spectroscopic binding constants (Ks) were calculated from the changes in the difference between the absorption at 391 and 416 nm except for the case of β-thujone and P-450cam, for which the changes in the absorption bands at 412 and 416 nm were used (Table I). These results indicate that P-450cam has a slightly higher affinity for α- than β-thujone, whereas the affinity of P-450BM-3 for α-thujone is significantly (5- or 6-fold) higher than for β-thujone. However, both compounds bind to both enzymes with affinities comparable with those for other non-native substrates.Table ISpectroscopic binding constants and radical recombination rates in the oxidation of α- and β-thujones by P450cam and P450BM3Ks at 25 °Ck1aThe value of 4.4 × 107 s-1 for the rate of cyclopropyl ring opening of 2α and 1.0 × 108 s-1 for ring opening of 2β was employed in calculating the recombination rates (29).

Superoxide dismutase and catalase were included in the incubation to consume any superoxide or H2O2 generated in the incubation by uncoupled oxygen reduction. The reaction of P-450cam with α-thujone (Fig. 4) yielded 76% 7-hydroxy-α-thujone (8) as the major product, 4.5% 4-hydroxy-α-thujone (3α), 0.3% 4-hydroxy-β-thujone (3β), 0.1% 4,10-dehydrothujone (7), and 0.1% (4S)-(+)-4-hydroxy-p-menth-1-en-6-one, and/or (4R)-(–)-4-hydroxy-p-menth-1-en-6-one (5/6), as well as other hydroxylated or dehydrogenated products (19%) (Fig. 5 and Table II). The overall conversion of α-thujone to products was 97%. In contrast, the reaction of P-450BM3 with α-thujone yielded 77% 4-hydroxy-α-thujone (3α), 2.1% 4-hydroxy-β-thujone (3β), 13% 7-hydroxy-α-thujone (8), 0.6% of the rearranged products 5/6, and 6% of other products (Table II). In this case, the overall conversion of α-thujone was 7%.

The conversion of β-thujone is 72%. Likewise, the reaction of P-450BM3 with β-thujone yielded 51% 4-hydroxy-β-thujone (3β), 1.9% 4-hydroxy-α-thujone (3α), 0.3% 4,10-dehydrothujone (7), 0.4% of rearranged products 5/6, and 21% of 7-hydroxy-β-thujone (13) with other hydroxylated products accounting for the rest (Table II). The conversion yield was 14% in this case. No carvacrol was detected as a metabolite in either incubation. P-450cam and P-450BM-3 are well characterized bacterial enzymes for which crystal structures have been determined with and without ligands bound in the active site cavity (34Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C.

As such, they are highly attractive enzymes for the investigation of mechanistic questions. We have therefore employed these two enzymes in conjunction with the new radical clock probes α- and β-thujone to investigate the mechanism of hydrocarbon hydroxylation. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table I, both of these probes bind with good affinity to P-450cam and P-450BM3. The spectroscopic changes observed on the addition of α-thujone to both enzymes are those expected for binding of the organic ligand within the active site with concomitant displacement of the distal water ligand from the heme iron atom (32Schenkman J.B. Sligar S.G. Cinti D.L. Schenkman J.B. Kupfer D. International Encyclopedia of Pharmacology & Therapeutics: Hepatic Cytochrome P-450 Monoxygenase System.

Similar spectroscopic changes are observed on binding of β-thujone to P-450BM3, but its binding to P-450cam gives rise to an anomalous spectroscopic transition in which the maximum of the resting state of the enzyme at 416 nm is slightly shifted to 412 nm rather than to the usual 390 nm. This spectroscopic shift, which corresponds to a so-called reverse Type I spectrum (32Schenkman J.B. Sligar S.G. Cinti D.L. Schenkman J.B. Kupfer D. International Encyclopedia of Pharmacology & Therapeutics: Hepatic Cytochrome P-450 Monoxygenase System. Pergamon Press, New York1982: 587-615Google Scholar), suggests that a perturbed sixth iron ligand is retained in the complex. The carbonyl group of the β-thujone may replace the water as a ligand to the iron, or the water ligand may be retained but be perturbed by the presence of β-thujone. This perturbation could result from changes in active site polarity or in the hydrogen bonding pattern of the water ligand. The two thujone probes not only bind tightly to P-450cam and P-450BM3 but are also accepted by these enzymes as substrates. Incubation of P-450cam with the thujone isomers gives mixtures of products. P-450cam primarily hydroxylates α-thujone on the tertiary carbon of the isopropyl group to give 8 (76%) but largely hydroxylates β-thujone at C-4 to give the unrearranged alcohol 3β (90%). P-450BM3, in contrast, hydroxylates α-thujone at the C-4 position to give the unrearranged alcohol 3α (77%) and β-thujone at both the C-4 position to give the unrearranged alcohol 3β (51%) and the tertiary carbon of the isopropyl group to give 13 (21%). In all cases the preferred site of oxidation is a tertiary C–H bond, in accord with the inverse correlation between bond strength and susceptibility to oxidation (38Frommer U. Ullrich V. Staudinger H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1970; 351: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 39White R.E. McCarthy M.-B. Egeberg K.D. Sligar S.G. Arch. Biochem.

Soc. 2004; 126: 8362-8363Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The selectivity for C-4 versus C-7 oxidation must reflect differences in the binding orientations of the thujones within the active sites of the two enzymes. Indeed, evidence for different orientations is provided by the spectroscopic data discussed above, which suggests that the binding of β-thujone to P-450cam differs from both that of its binding to P-450BM3 and of the binding of α-thujone to either enzyme. Previous studies of the metabolism of α-thujone in mice have shown that the principal metabolite in that species, as found here for P-450cam but not P-450BM3, is the 7-hydroxy product 8 (26Hold K.M. Sirisoma N.S. Casida J.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28Hold K.M. Sirisoma N.S. Ikeda T. Narahashi T. Casida J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3826-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The same is true in the metabolism by rat and human liver microsomes, except that the 4-hydroxy metabolite 3α and the 7,8-dehydro product 12 are also significant metabolites. Metabolism of β-thujone by the mouse, rat, and human primarily gives the 7- and 4-hydroxy metabolites, in agreement with the finding here that the principal route of oxidation of this compound by P-450cam and P-450BM3 is 4-hydroxylation to give 3β (Table I). More importantly, the two rearrangement reactions observed in the hydroxylation of α-thujone by P-450cam generate the minor products 3β (0.3%) and 5/6 (0.1%). Both of these rearrangement products stem from oxidation of the substrate at C-4. In addition, two other minor metabolites arise from oxidation at C-4, the unrearranged alcohol 3α (4.5%) and the dehydrogenation product 7 (0.1%). Although C-4 is not the major site of the oxidation reaction, the products of oxidation of this carbon provide information on the mechanism of the hydroxylation reaction. All three products can be rationalized by initial hydrogen abstraction by the enzyme ferryl species to give the C-4 α-thujone radical 2α. Recombination of this radical with the iron-bound hydroxyl species yields the unrearranged alcohol 3α, the major product of the reaction at this site. However, to the extent that inversion of the C-4 radical stereochemistry competes with radical recombination, the rearranged alcohol 3β is also obtained (Fig. 2). The cyclopropyl group can undergo ring opening in competition with the C-4 inversion reaction, resulting in formation of the monocyclic products 5 and/or 6. Finally, formation of the desaturated product 7 can be rationalized either by conversion of the C-4 radical to a cation concomitant with abstraction of a proton from the methyl group or by abstraction of the vicinal methyl hydrogen atom by the ferric hydroxide species obtained after the first hydrogen abstraction. Studies of the isotope effects associated with P-450-catalyzed dehydrogenation reactions indicate that the initial step is usually hydrogen abstraction from the carbon with the weaker C–H bond, followed by loss of a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon to give the double bond (42Rettie A.E. Boberg M. Rettenmeier A.W. Baillie T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13733-13738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Obach R.S. Drug Metab. Disp. 2001; 29: 1599-1607PubMed Google Scholar, 44Korzekwa K.R. Trager W.F. Nagata K. Parkinson A. Gillette J.R. Drug Metab. Disp. 1990; 18: 974-979PubMed Google Scholar). The first abstraction is associated with a large isotope effect and the second only with a weak one. A recent computational study has concluded that P-450-catalyzed desaturations proceed via a cationic intermediate and are favored by steric hindrance to recombination of the initial carbon radical and iron-bound oxygen (45Kumar D. de Visser S.P. Shaik S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5072-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a previous attempt to demonstrate the involvement of a radical intermediate in a non-P-450 desaturation reaction by placing a cyclopropyl ring on the carbon that is oxidized was unsuccessful, presumably because the cyclopropyl ring opening was too slow in that system to compete with the desaturation process (46Villorbina G. Roura L. Camps F. Joglar J. Fabriás G. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 68: 2820-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The ratio of the C-4-derived products depends on the relative rates of the reactions that channel the C-4 radical into the four different products. In previous chemical studies, we have calculated that opening of the cyclopropyl ring in the α-thujone C-4 radical occurs at a rate of 4.4 × 107 s–1 (29He X. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Org. Chem. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). From this value and the ratio of the ring opened products 5/6 to the unrearranged alcohol isomers 3α plus 3β, it is possible to calculate a value (k1) for the radical recombination reaction of the α-thujone radical 2α (or 2) according to the following equation. k1=[3α+3β5/6]×[4.4×107s−1](Eq. 1) The value thus calculated is k1 = 0.2 × 1010 s–1 (Table I). It is not possible to determine the recombination rate independently using the rate of methyl group inversion as the “clock” because our chemical studies showed that there is an inherent bias in solution for quenching of the radical from the less stereochemically hindered α-face. A similar bias is observed in the reactions of the C-4 enolate with alkylating agents (29He X. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Org. Chem. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). In the chemical studies, the ratio of α- to β-products is determined primarily by the differential rates of hydrogen atom transfer to the stereoisomeric radicals. This stereochemical bias precluded calibration of the rate of the inversion reaction and, indeed, left open the possibility that the C-4 radical is planar rather than a pair of inverting tetrahedral structures. From the present results we can say that the α-thujone C-4 radical undergoes inversion at approximately the same rate as the ring opening reaction because we obtain approximately as much 3β as 5/6, but we cannot obtain an independently determined radical recombination rate. It is remarkable in this context that recombination to give 3α competes very effectively with formation of 3β in the oxidation of 1α, because chemical quenching of 2α and 2β with thiophenol resulted almost exclusively in delivery of the hydrogen atom to the α-face regardless of which radical conformation was initially generated. The hydroxylated product predicted by the chemical results would be 3β, which is found as the minor of the two products. Thus, despite the inherent steric preference for delivery of the quenching moiety from the α-face indicated by the chemical studies, delivery to the β-face in the enzymatic hydroxylation reaction is an effective process. The same result is obtained in the oxidation of a-thujone by P-450BM3, for which the 3α:3β product ratio is ∼6:1. This may reflect the much faster rate of the oxygen rebound than hydrogen transfer reaction or an ability of the active site to overcome the intrinsic stereochemical bias by binding and orienting the substrate. If the cyclopropyl ring opening reaction is used as an internal clock, it appears that dehydrogenation of the C-4 radical occurs at approximately the same rate as opening of the cyclopropyl ring, because the dehydrogenated product 7 is formed in approximately the same amounts as the ring-opened products 5/6 in the oxidation of both α- and β-thujone by P-450cam and P-450BM3 (Table I). The oxidation of β-thujone by P-450cam occurs primarily at C-4, yielding 90% of the unisomerized alcohol 3β. In addition, small amounts of the inverted alcohol 3α and of the ring opened products 5/6 are also obtained (Table II). Analysis of the data for the P-450cam-catalyzed oxidation of β-thujone as done for the α-thujone oxidation, using the rate of 1.0 × 108 s–1 for ring opening of the radical 2β (29He X. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Org. Chem. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar), gives a recombination rate of 2.8 × 1010 s–1. Similar analysis of the oxidation of α-thujone by P-450BM3 results in a calculated rate of 0.6 × 1010 s–1 for the recombination rate (Table I). The corresponding rate determined from the data for the reaction of P-450BM3 with β-thujone is 1.6 × 1010 s–1. These values are consistent with values previously reported for secondary radicals (10Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Stearns R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 3415-3420Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 11Bowry V.W. Ingold K.U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5699-5707Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 18Auclair K. Hu Z. Little D.M.

Commun. 2004; : 512-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The variation among them presumably reflects the differences in the catalytic environment in the various substrate-enzyme complexes. Generation of the thujone C-4 cation by nonenzymatic means shows that it rearranges almost exclusively to the phenol carvacrol (Fig. 7) (29He X. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Org. Chem. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Only a tiny trace (1–2%) of a peak with the retention time of 5/6 and no trace of 7 were found in these chemical studies. It is therefore significant that no trace of carvacrol is found in the incubations of the P-450 enzymes with either α-or β-thujone. This indicates that the cationic intermediate is not detectably formed. Interestingly, a trace of the unsaturated product 7 is found in our incubations (Table I). Computational studies suggest that desaturation products are formed via the cation (45Kumar D. de Visser S.P. Shaik S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5072-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, they also indicate that the desaturation reaction occurs within a very tight complex of the iron-hydroxyl intermediate and the carbon radical generated by the initial hydrogen abstraction (45Kumar D. de Visser S.P. Shaik S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5072-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). If the cation is actually formed, this intimate ion pair mechanism may channel the cation toward the desaturated product, in contrast to its fate in solution (29He X. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Org. Chem. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). The absence of carvacrol, and the formation of only a trace of the desaturated product, argue against a significant role for the cationic species in this P-450 oxidation. This result is inconsistent with a mechanism that invokes oxidation of the C–H bond by the iron hydroperoxy complex, because the cation would be expected to be a central intermediate in such a reaction (15Chandrasena R.E.P. Vatsis K.P. Coon M.J. Hollenberg P.F. Newcomb M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In sum, α- and β-thujone are oxidized at C-4 by P-450 enzymes to give, inter alia, products in which (a) the stereochemistry of the oxidized center is inverted, (b) the adjacent cyclopropyl ring undergoes ring opening, or (c) a double bond is introduced by a dehydrogenation reaction. Furthermore, the ratio of the ring opened products to α-hydroxylated thujones (3α and 3β) indicates that the reaction proceeds via a radical mechanism with a radical recombination rate that ranges from 0.2 × 1010 to 2.8 × 1010 s–1. Apart from unavoidable experimental error, this variation reflects the dependence of the oxygen rebound rate on the specific substrate and enzyme. Theoretical calculations suggest that the measured rate is at least partially determined by the ratio of the two spin states of the ferryl oxidizing species (25Kumar D. de Visser S.P. Sharma P.K. Cohen S. Shaik S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 1907-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the extreme situation, where the low spin state only gives unrearranged product and the high spin state only gives rearranged product, the ratio of rearranged to unrearranged product would be determined by the ratio of the two spin states. The radical clock measurements truly measure the recombination rate if only the high spin state is significantly populated, but as the proportion of the low spin state increases in importance it will elevate the amount of unrearranged product that is formed by a process that does not compete with rearrangement. This results in an artificially high calculated radical recombination rate. Thus, the rates reported here are the maximum possible, and some variation in rates is to be expected as the enzyme active site and substrate are changed. The simultaneous observation of inversion of stereochemistry, a reaction that is faster than ring opening, without the formation of carvacrol via a cation pathway strongly supports the proposal of a free radical rather than OH+ insertion hydroxylation mechanism."

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the primary route for the biosynthesis of PC consists of three consecutive methylation steps of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) catalyzed by the phospholipid N-methyltransferases Cho2p and Opi3p. To investigate how these biosynthetic enzymes contribute to the composition of the PC species profile, the precursor-product relationships between PE and newly synthesized PC were determined at the level of the molecular species by using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and stable isotope labeling. In vivo labeling of yeast cells for 10 min with [methyl-D3]methionine revealed the preferential methylation of di-C16:1 PE over a range of PE species compositions.

Apart from being a structural component of the membrane barrier, PC is involved in other cellular functions, including having a role as a precursor of lipid second messengers (1Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). In the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PC accounts for ∼40–50% of the cellular phospholipid content (2Daum G. Tuller G. Nemec T. Hrastnik C. Balliano G. Cattel L. Milla P. Rocco F. Conzelmann A. Vionnet C. Kelly D.E. Kelly S. Schweizer E. Schuller H.J. Hojad U. Greiner E. Finger K.

Yeast strains with defects in PC production experience respiratory deficiency, implying an important role for PC in the biogenesis and/or proper functioning of mitochondria (4Griac P. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25692-25698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, the biosynthesis of PC is involved in the regulation of vesicular transport from the Golgi via the phospholipid transfer protein Sec14p (5Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Whitters E.A.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1117-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).The de novo biosynthesis of PC in yeast proceeds mainly via three sequential methylation reactions of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (Fig. 1) (7Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). When exogenously supplied choline is present, net PC production also occurs via the CDP-choline route (8McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14776-14783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The methylation of PE is mediated by the membrane resident phospholipid N-methyltransferases (PNMTs), Cho2p and Opi3p, which utilize S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a methyl donor. Cho2p converts PE to phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PMME), and Opi3p catalyzes the second and the third methylation step. Both PNMTs have been predicted to be integral membrane proteins based on hydropathy plots (9Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15428-15435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and have been localized to the ER membrane (10Zinser E. Sperka-Gottlieb C.D. Fasch E.V. Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2026-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar).Like the other phospholipid classes in yeast, PC is composed of molecular species that mainly possess acyl chains with a carbon chain length of C16 or C18 (11Schneiter R. Brügger B. Sandhoff R. Zellnig G. Leber A. Lampl M. Athenstaedt K. Hrastnik C. Eder S. Daum G. Paltauf F. Wieland F.T. Kohlwein S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). These fatty acids are either saturated or mono-unsaturated with the saturated fatty acids predominantly esterified at the sn-1 position of the glycerol backbone (12Wagner S. Paltauf F. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1429-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Control of the acyl chain composition is essential for creating the appropriate membrane fluidity and is expected to play a role in intracellular PC transport and in more specific functions of PC. The biosynthesis of PC plays a major role in generating the molecular species profile of PC. The contributions of the methylation of PE and the CDP-choline route at the molecular species level were recently distinguished by labeling yeast cells with deuterated methionine and choline, respectively, and subsequent analysis of the pools of newly synthesized PC species by ESI-MS/MS (13Boumann H.A. Damen M.J. Versluis C. Heck A.J. de Kruijff B. de Kroon A.I. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3054-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Whereas the CDP-choline pathway produces both the di- and mono-unsaturated PC species present in the steady state profile, the methylation route yields predominantly di-unsaturated PC species. Interestingly, the species profile of the newly synthesized PC derived from PE was found to differ from that of the PE precursor pool, with the 32:2 (di-C16:1) species enriched at the expense of the other species, which is indicative for preferential methylation of the 32:2 species (13Boumann H.A. Damen M.J. Versluis C. Heck A.J. de Kruijff B. de Kroon A.I. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3054-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).The aim of the present study is to investigate how the selective methylation of PE species observed in vivo is accomplished. This issue was addressed by ESI-MS/MS analyses of the precursor-product relationship between PC and PE molecular species in vivo, in intact yeast cells that differed in species composition of the PE pool, and in vitro in isolated microsomes. In addition, the contributions of the individual methyltransferases Cho2p and Opi3p in generating the PC molecular species profile have been addressed using opi3 and cho2 deletion strains, respectively. The results indicate that the substrate specificity of the methyltransferases, of Cho2p in particular, accounts for the species selectivity in the methylation reactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains—S. cerevisiae strain BY4742 (MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0) and the derived cho2Δ (cho2::KanMX) were obtained from Research Genetics (Carlsbad, CA).

The medium of the cho2Δopi3Δ strain was additionally supplemented with 1.0 mm choline. Pulse labeling experiments were performed as follows. Cells grown to midlog phase (A600 0.8–1.2; Unicam Helios Epsilon spectrophotometer, MS Scientific, Berlin, Germany) were washed with and resuspended in 0.8 liter of synthetic lactate medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 2% lactate, 0.1% glucose, pH 5.5) in the presence of the supplements mentioned above. The wild-type, pct1Δ, and opi3Δ strains were labeled with 40 mg/liter [methyl-D3]methionine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) for 10 min. The wild-type strain was also cultured and pulse labeled in the above (semi)synthetic medium containing 2% glucose as a carbon source instead of lactate. The cho2Δ and cho2Δopi3Δ cells were labeled with 4.0 mm monomethylethanolamine (MME) (Fluka, Buch, Switzerland) or 4.0 mm dimethylethanolamine (DME) (Fluka) for 30 min in the presence or absence of 40 mg/liter [methyl-D3]methionine as indicated. Both strains were also labeled with 2.0 mm [D4]ethanolamine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) for 30 min. The labeling was ended by adding a cold mixture of KCN, NaF, and NaN3 to final concentrations of 15 mm each to arrest cellular processes, and the cells were stored on ice. Cell pellets corresponding to ∼100 A600 units were resuspended in 1 ml of water and homogenized by vortexing with glass beads three times for 1 min with intermittent cooling on ice. Phospholipids were extracted as described (16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42122) Google Scholar).Phospholipid Methylation in Vitro—Microsomes were isolated as described (17de Kroon A.I. Koorengevel M.C. Goerdayal S.S. Mulders P.C. Janssen M.J. de Kruijff B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, midlog cells grown in semisynthetic lactate medium were harvested, and spheroplasts were prepared using zymolyase (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan). The spheroplasts were homogenized, and microsomes were isolated as the 32,500 × g pellet of the 20,200 × g postmitochondrial supernatant. Methylation of PE was initiated by adding microsomes at a protein concentration of 0.25 μg/μl to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5 mmS[methyl-D3]adenosyl-l-methionine (CDN Isotopes, Pointe-Claire, Canada) in a final volume of 300 μl (18Janssen M.J. de Jong H.M. de Kruijff B. de Kroon A.I. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, the methylation was ended by adding 1.4 ml of a mixture of chloroform, methanol, and 0.5 mm HCl (6:12:1, v/v/v), which was followed by phospholipid extraction as described above.Mass Spectrometry—ESI-MS/MS analysis of lipid extracts was performed using a Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole MS instrument (Micromass, Manchester, UK) in the positive ion mode. Lipid extracts were dissolved at 0.5 mm phospholipid phosphorus in CHCl3, CH3OH, H2O (2:15:3, v/v/v), with 1% (v/v) formic acid added to reduce the content of [M + Na]+ adducts. The samples were introduced into the MS instrument by an electrospray source with a flow rate of ∼50 nL/min. The capillary and cone voltages were set at 1.5 kV and 30 V, respectively, and collision-activated dissociation was applied using argon and collision energies of 30 eV. Data are presented as averages of 50–150 repetitive scans of 10 s obtained from at least two independent experiments. Identification of phospholipid species was carried out as described (13Boumann H.A. Damen M.J. Versluis C. Heck A.J. de Kruijff B. de Kroon A.I. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3054-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The [M + H]+ ions of the PC species and the [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ adducts of PE, PMME, and PDME were monitored as indicated in Table I. The intensity of the mono-isotope signal of each mono-unsaturated lipid species was corrected for the coinciding second isotope peak of the di-unsaturated lipid species with an m/z value of 2 units lower. For quantification, ESI-MS/MS data were corrected for the inverse relationship between mass and signal response of the MS instrument, which was calibrated as described previously (13Boumann H.A.

This correction was not applied to spectra of the labeled phospholipids because these lipids were introduced into the instrument at low concentrations (<0.005 mm). In that concentration range the instrument response was found to be virtually independent of the acyl chain length in the relevant m/z range (cf. Refs. 13Boumann H.A. Damen M.J. Versluis C.

The profile of phospholipid acyl chains in yeast can be easily manipulated, e.g. by growing the cells on different carbon sources (22Tuller G. Nemec T. Hrastnik C. Daum G. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) or by using phospholipid biosynthetic mutants. Fig. 2A shows an ESI-MS/MS spectrum of total cellular PE obtained by neutral loss scanning for m/z 141 in wild-type BY4742 cells grown on glucose. The most abundant PE species were 32:2, 32:1, 34:2, and 34:1, which predominantly consist of combinations of the acyl chains C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, and, C18:1 (12Wagner S. Paltauf F. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1429-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). When wild-type cells were grown on lactate instead of glucose, the PE species profile drastically changed with strong reductions in the contents of the mono-unsaturated species 32:1 and 34:1 that were compensated for by an increase in 34:2 (Fig. 2B). Inactivation of the CDP-choline route by deletion of the PCT1 gene (23Nikawa J. Yonemura K. Yamashita S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) resulted in an increase of 32:2 PE at the expense of 34:2 PE compared with the wild-type (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2The molecular species composition of PE depends on the carbon source and varies between wild-type and pct1Δ cells.A, ESI-MS/MS spectrum of the PE molecular species from wild-type yeast grown on semisynthetic glucose medium to the midlog phase. The PE molecular species were detected by neutral loss scanning for the PE head group at m/z 141. Both [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ adducts were detected, and the latter are marked with an asterisk. The unmarked peaks represent the first isotopic signals corresponding to the preceding peaks with a mass difference of 1 Da.

Subsequently, total lipid extracts were prepared and analyzed by ESI-MS/MS using parent ion scanning for m/z 193 corresponding to the phosphocholine head group with three deuterated methyl groups. The parent ion scan of [D9]PC from wild-type cells grown on glucose (Fig. 3A) revealed a species composition that is enriched in the 32:2 species compared with the profile of the precursor PE (Fig. 2A). The relative extents of conversion of the PE species to PC were quantified by dividing the proportions of the most prominent [D9]PC species by those of their corresponding PE species and have been summarized for 32:2 and 34:2 in Fig. 3B. Irrespective of the species composition of the PE precursor pool, the 32:2 species was prefentially methylated to PC to similar extents (Fig. 3B), demonstrating species-selective methylation by the PNMTs in vivo. The product/precursor ratios of the monounsaturated species 32:1 and 34:1 did not yield statistically reliable numbers because of the relatively small amounts of these species in the PE precursor pool of the lactate-grown cells (Fig. 2B). The ratios in wild-type cells grown on glucose amounted to 0.8 (±0.1) and 0.4 (±0.1) (mean ± variation, n = 2) for 32:1 and 34:1, respectively.Fig. 3The methyltransferases preferentially convert 32:2 PE to PC to an extent that is independent of the species composition of the substrate PE.A, ESI-MS/MS spectrum of the newly synthesized [D9]PC molecular species in wild-type cells cultured in semisynthetic glucose medium obtained by parent ion scanning for m/z 193. B, quantification of the relative extents of conversion of the two most abundant PE species to PC for wild-type cells grown on semisynthetic glucose (black bars) and lactate medium (gray bars) and for pct1Δ cells grown on lactate medium (white bars). The product/precursor ratios were calculated by dividing the proportions of 32:2 and 34:2 PC in the [D9]PC profile by the proportions of the corresponding PE species in the cell homogenate (see Fig. 2). The species compositions of PE (t = 0) and newly synthesized PC (t = 10 min) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data represent mean values from three experiments (± S.D.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Methylation of PE in Vitro Also Leads to an Enrichment of 32:2 PC—To test whether the preferential methylation of 32:2 PE is an intrinsic property of the enzymes in the ER, similar experiments were carried out using microsomes. The PE species profile of microsomes isolated from wild-type cells grown on lactate was almost similar to that of the corresponding cell homogenate (compare the gray bars in Fig. 2B) with mainly 32:2 (26.9 ± 2.4%), 32:1 (5.3 ± 1.1%), 34:2 (57.5 ± 2.8%), and 34:1 (7.9 ± 1.6%) (mean ± S.D., n = 9). Incubation of microsomes with 0.5 mmS[methyl-D3]adenosyl-l-methionine for 10 min at 30 °C revealed that the relative extents of conversion of the microsomal PE species to [D9]PC were similar to those found in vivo (Fig. 4). This was even more pronounced when the relative extents of conversion were calculated by relating the species profile of newly synthesized PC in vivo to the microsomal PE species rather than to the total cellular PE species (not shown). Hence, the preferential methylation of 32:2 PE observed in vivo is retained in isolated microsomes.Fig. 4The preference of the phospholipid N-methyltransferases for converting 32:2 PE is similar in vivo and in vitro. The relative degrees of methylation of 32:2 and 34:2 PE were determined in vitro as explained in the legend to Fig. 3. Microsomes isolated from the wild-type strain grown on lactate medium were pulse labeled with S[methyl-D3]adenosyl-l-methionine as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The product/precursor ratios in vitro (black bars) are compared with the in vivo conditions (white bars; data taken from Fig. 3B). Error bars represent the S.D. (n ≥ 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Substrate Preference of Cho2p in opi3Δ Cells—To get insight into the stage at which the non-random methylation of PE species occurs, we studied the contributions of the three methylation steps individually. For this purpose, a strategy was set up using yeast deletion strains lacking either Cho2p, Opi3p, or both (Fig. 1). To establish the product/precursor ratios for Cho2p, the opi3Δ strain was pulse labeled; the strain is defective in performing the second and third methylation reactions and accumulates PMME (24McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1989; 122: 317-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows the neutral loss scan for the D3-labeled head group PMME at m/z 158, which revealed the formation of predominantly 32:2 and 34:2 PMME. Comparison of the profile of newly synthesized [D3]PMME to that of its precursor PE in terms of product/precursor ratios showed an enrichment of 32:2 species (Fig. 5B, white bars). Similar results were obtained in vitro using microsomes isolated from the opi3Δ cells (Fig. 5B, black bars). Together, these data demonstrate that the first methylation by Cho2p already leads to an enrichment of the di-unsaturated 32:2 species.Fig. 5The Cho2p-mediated methylation of PE to PMME exhibits similar preferences for 32:2 PE both in vivo and in vitro.A, ESI-MS/MS spectrum of newly synthesized PMME in the opi3Δ strain. Cells grown on lactate medium were pulse labeled with 40 mg/liter [methyl-D3]methionine for 10 min. The newly synthesized PMME species were analyzed by neutral loss scanning for the [methyl-D3]monomethylethanolamine moiety (m/z 158). Both [M + H]+ and asterisk-marked [M + Na]+ species are indicated. B, comparison of the relative extents of conversion of the two most prominent PE species to PMME in vivo (white bars) and in vitro (black bars).

Pulsing cho2Δ cells with [methyl-D3]methionine for up to 30 min did not yield a detectable [D9]-PC pool (data not shown) in agreement with the limited ability of Opi3p to methylate PE (3Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1988; 120: 909-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Janssen M.J. de Jong H.M. de Kruijff B. de Kroon A.I. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cho2Δ cells were pulsed in the presence of MME to supply the cells with the Opi3p substrate PMME via the Kennedy pathway (Fig. 1). However, under these conditions PMME was rapidly chased into PC, preventing the analysis of the pool of PMME species available for Opi3p.To solve this problem, the PMME species profile was determined in a cho2Δopi3Δ double deletion strain pulsed for 30 min with MME in which PMME was not further methylated. As shown in Fig. 6, the species profile of PMME in cho2Δopi3Δ strongly resembled that of PE newly synthesized via the CDP-ethanolamine route, which was determined after pulsing the cells with [D4]ethanolamine. In turn, the]D4]PE profiles were very similar between the cho2Δ and cho2Δopi3Δ strains (Fig. 6). These results indicate that similar pools of diacylglycerol species are used for the synthesis via the Kennedy pathway of PMME and PE and that deletion of the second methyltransferase does not affect the species composition of this diacylglycerol pool. Based on this, the PMME species profile determined in the cho2Δopi3Δ cells was taken as a reliable reflection of the PMME precursor pool for Opi3p in cho2Δ cells. Similarly, the species profile of the PDME precursor pool in the cho2Δ cells was established and was found to resemble that of CDP-choline derived PC (25Boumann H.A. de Kruijff B. Heck A.J. de Kroon A.I. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Fig. 6Determination of the species composition of the PMME substrate for Opi3p. As a measure for the PMME species composition in cho2Δ, the PMME species profile of the strain cho2Δopi3Δ was determined by pulsing the cells with 4.0 mm MME for 30 min (black bars) and subsequent ESI-MS/MS analysis by neutral loss scanning (m/z 155). The utilization of similar diacylglycerol species in the CDP-ethanolamine route in cho2Δopi3Δ (gray bars) and cho2Δ (white bars) cells was verified by pulse labeling both strains with 2.0 mm [D4]ethanolamine for 30 min.

Newly synthesized PC species derived from PMME and PDME were detected by parent ion scanning for m/z 190 and 187, respectively. For both MME-derived [D6]PC and DME-derived [D3]PC, the relative extent of conversion to PC was slightly larger for the 32:2 precursor than for the 34:2 precursor (Fig. 7). The data demonstrate that the species-selective methylation of PE in vivo is accomplished by both PNMTs, although to a lesser extent by Opi3p than by Cho2p.Fig. 7Opi3p slightly prefers 32:2 substrates in both the second and the third methylation step of PE.

The ordered IIBMtl domain (residues 375-471 of IIMtl) consists of a four-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked by two helices (α1 and α3) on one face and helix α2 on the opposite face with a characteristic Rossmann fold comprising two right-handed β1α1β2 and β3α2β4 motifs. The active site loop is structurally very similar to that of the eukaryotic protein tyrosine phosphatases, with the active site cysteine (Cys-384) primed in the thiolate state (pKa < 5.6) for nucleophilic attack at the phosphorylated histidine (His-554) of the IIAMtl domain through stabilization by hydrogen bonding interactions with neighboring backbone amide groups at positions i + 2/3/4 from Cys-384 and with the hydroxyl group of Ser-391 at position i + 7. Modeling of the phosphorylated state of IIBMtl suggests that the phosphoryl group can be readily stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions with backbone amides in the i + 2/4/5/6/7 positions as well as with the hydroxyl group of Ser390 at position i + 6. Despite the absence of any significant sequence identity, the structure of IIBMtl is remarkably similar to the structures of bovine protein tyrosine phosphatase (which contains two long insertions relative to IIBMtl) and the cytoplasmic B component of enzyme IIChb, which fulfills an analogous role to IIBMtl in the N,N′-diacetylchitobiose branch of the phosphotransferase system.

The initial steps of the PTS are common to all sugars in that enzyme I transfers a phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate to the histidine phosphocarrier protein (HPr). Thereafter, the phosphoryl group is transferred from HPr to the sugar-specific enzymes II. There are four general classes of enzymes II (2Herzberg O. Klevit R.E. Curr. Opin. Struct.

As part of our continuing structural work on the PTS, we present the solution structure of IIBMtl using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. Expression and Purification of IIBmtl—The mannitol transporter (IIMtl) is composed of three domains expressed as a single protein containing, from the N- to the C-terminal end, the domains C-B-A (26Van Weeghel R.P.

The B domain contains the second phosphorylation site (Cys-384) of the IIMtl complex. Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA was used as the template to amplify, by PCR, the region corresponding to the B domain together with the C-B linker (26Van Weeghel R.P. Meyer G.H. Keck W.

The forward PCR primer 5′-AAAGAAGAAGATGATCATATGGCAGCAACTCGTCGT-3′, spanning the region from bases 1155 to 1190 of the NCBI file V01503, contained an engineered NdeI site (underlined), and the reverse primer 5′-CGCGCCTAGGTCGACCAGGTTTCATCAGGAATCGTCAAAGCTGTC-3′, spanning the region from bases 1631 to 1587, contained an engineered SalI site (underlined) and a tandem pair of in-frame termination codons (italics). This PCR product was designed to express a peptide encoding amino acid residues Ala-349 to Ser-489 of IIMtl preceded by a Met residue. The NdeI- and SalI-cut PCR product was purified and cloned into the corresponding sites of the vector pRE1 (25Cornilescu G. Lee B.R. Cornilescu C. Wang G. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42289-42298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The selected clone was verified by DNA sequencing. A fragment of the original clone in pRE1 encoding residues 366 to 489, which corresponds to the IIBMtl domain, was then subcloned into a modified pET-32-a vector (Novagen, Inc., Madison, Wisconsin) to form a thioredoxin fusion protein with a His6 tag. The original thrombin cleavage site was mutated, and a new thrombin cut site was inserted at the N-terminal end of the protein to remove the thioredoxin and the His6 tag. The new thrombin cleavage site added a glycine residue before Ser-366. The selected clone was verified by DNA sequencing. The IIBmtl-fusion protein was expressed at 37 °C in E. coli BL-21(DE3) cells in minimal medium using 15NH4Cl and [13C6]glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. The cells were microfluidized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The crude extract was loaded onto a 15-ml column of chelating Sepharose charged with nickel sulfate. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 2 mm β-ME. The protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 0.7 m imidazole. Thrombin (25 units) (Novagen Inc.) was added to the IIBmtl-thioredoxin fusion protein, and the mixture was dialyzed overnight in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm β-ME at room temperature to remove the imidazole and allow thrombin cleavage of the thioredoxin and His6 tags. A suspension (1 ml) of Chelex-100 in 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, was added to the dialysis buffer to remove excess nickel. After overnight digestion, the protein was passed over a 3-ml column of benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) to remove the thrombin. A second nickel column removed the His6-thioredoxin cleavage product. The combined column fractions were concentrated and loaded onto a G-75 Sephadex column (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm β-ME). One peak eluted with an apparent molecular mass of ∼14 kDa. The fractions were collected and concentrated using Centricon YM-3 (3000 molecular weight cutoff) ultrafiltration units to a final volume of ∼2 ml. To dephosphorylate IIBMtl, the pH was lowered to 2 in the presence of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, and 2 mm β-ME. The denatured protein was incubated in a water bath for 2 h at 37 °C. The pH was raised to 7.5, and the protein was refolded by dialysis in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, overnight at 4 °C. The buffer was exchanged to 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.1, 25 mm dithiothreitol, and either 95% H2O/5% D2O or 99.996% D2O by ultrafiltration for NMR experiments. The protein concentration in the NMR samples varied from 0.7 to 1.5 mm. The composition of the purified IIBMtl domain was verified by mass spectrometry. NMR Spectroscopy—All spectra were recorded at 35 °C on Bruker DMX500, DMX600, DRX600, DMX750, and DRX800 spectrometers equipped either with x, y, z-shielded gradient triple resonance probes or z-shielded gradient triple resonance cryoprobes.

NOE interproton distance restraints were derived from three-dimensional 15N-, 13C-, and 13C/13C-separated NOE and four-dimensional 13C/13C-separated NOE experiments. Three-bond J couplings (3JHNHα, 3JNCγ, and 3JC′-Cγ couplings) were measured using quantitative J correlation spectroscopy (36Bax A. Vuister G.W. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Wang A.C. Tschudin R. Zhu G.

Structure Determination—The solution structure of IIBMtl (residues 366-489 of IIMtl) was solved on the basis of 2227 experimental NMR restraints, including 200 residual dipolar couplings. The N- (residues 367-374) and C termini (residues 472-489) are disordered as judged by heteronuclear 15N-1H NOE data (values < 0.4), as well as the absence of any nonsequential interproton NOE interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2073267370,"Heme reduction of ferric lactoperoxidase (LPO) into its ferrous form initially leads to the accumulation of the unstable form of LPO-Fe(II), which spontaneously converts to a more stable species, the two of which can be identified by Soret peaks at 440 and 434 nm, respectively. Our data demonstrate that both LPO-Fe(II) species are capable of binding O2 at a similar rate to generate the ferrous-dioxy complex. Its formation with respect to O2 was first order and monophasic and with rate constants of kon = 3.8 × 104m–1 s–1 and koff = 11.2 s–1. The dissociation rate constant for the formation of LPO-Fe(II)-O2 is relatively high, in contrast to hemoprotein model compounds. This high dissociation rate can be attributed to a combination of effects that include the positive trans effect of the proximal ligand, the heme pocket environment, and the geometry of the Fe-O2 linkage. Our results have also shown that the decay of the LPO-Fe(II)-O2 complex occurs by two sequential O2-independent steps. The first step involves formation of a short-lived intermediate that can be characterized by its Soret absorption peak at 416 nm and may be attributed to the weakening of the Fe(II)-O2 linkage with a rate constant of 0.5 s–1. The second step is spontaneous conversion of this intermediate to generate the native enzyme and presumably superoxide as end products with a rate constant of 0.03 s–1. A comprehensive kinetic model that links LPO-Fe(II)-O2 complex formation to the LPO catalase-like activity, combined with the classic catalytic cycle, is presented here.

The second step is spontaneous conversion of this intermediate to generate the native enzyme and presumably superoxide as end products with a rate constant of 0.03 s–1. A comprehensive kinetic model that links LPO-Fe(II)-O2 complex formation to the LPO catalase-like activity, combined with the classic catalytic cycle, is presented here. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is freely diffusible through biological membranes, and its overproduction or inhalation is extremely destructive to cells and tissues (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C.

Superoxide ( O2−˙) is mainly formed through the univalent reduction of molecular oxygen by the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase in phagocytic cells and endothelial cells (3Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). In most non-phagocytic cells, however, the main source of O2−˙ is from the mitochondria (3Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). Most of the O2−˙ generated in vivo is utilized primarily to produce H2O2 nonenzymatically or by superoxide dismutase (4McCord J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nitric oxide synthase and several oxidase enzymes, such as monoamine and amino acid oxidase, can also directly produce H2O2 (5Rosen G.M. Tsai P. Weaver J. Porasuphatana S. Roman L.J. Starkov A.A.

Because H2O2 has both beneficial and harmful functions, its effect in a given biological setting requires precise control to regulate its action at tissues throughout the body. Therefore, understanding the circumstances that influence the rate of H2O2 synthesis and degradation is of critical importance for optimal biological function. Catalase and cytoplasmic glutathione peroxidase are the major H2O2 scavengers and protect cells from the toxic effects of H2O2 by catalyzing its decomposition into molecular oxygen and water (4McCord J.M.

Recently, lactoperoxidase (LPO) 1The abbreviations used are: LPO, lactoperoxidase; NO, nitric oxide. has been identified as the major macromolecular consumer of H2O2 in animal airway secretions (9El-Chemaly S.

The enzyme has been identified as an antimicrobial agent in milk, saliva, and tears and is produced by goblet cells and submucosal glands that form airway mucus secretions (33Reiter B. Perraudin J.P.

A variety of evidence suggests that the peroxidase heme prosthetic group is involved in a wide range of important processes through its catalytic reactions that include binding, transport, and activation of oxygen, as well as deactivation of reactive oxygen compounds, oxidation/reduction reactions, and electron transport (17Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 19Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35441-35448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, the heme prosthetic group of LPO accommodates a large variety of molecules as ligands of the iron cation (17Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Binding of these ligands to the peroxidase heme iron causes enzyme inhibition (17Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The presence of two different conformational states of the reduced form of LPO (LPO-Fe(II) state) has been reported in studies using a variety of spectroscopic techniques (36Lange R. Heiber-Langer I. Bonfils C. Fabre I. Negishi M. Balny C. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 89-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 37Hu S. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem.

However, functional differences between the two forms have not been reported until recently (39Abu-Soud H.M. Hazen S.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10747-10755Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For example, previous resonance Raman spectroscopy studies demonstrated that the two LPO-Fe(II) species display no significant differences in the character of the Fe-N(histidine) bond, and both share the same state configuration (40Manthey J.A. Boldt N.J. Bocian D.F. Chan S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6734-6741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our recent diatomic binding studies have shown the existence of two spectroscopically and kinetically distinguishable LPO-Fe(II) species at equilibrium, one with the partially open heme pocket and one with the heme pocket relatively closed (39Abu-Soud H.M. Hazen S.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10747-10755Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that the presence of pathophysiologically relevant levels of peroxidases and H2O2 serves as a catalytic sink for NO and reversibly inhibits NO-mediated bronchodilation of preconstricted tracheal rings (14Abu-Soud H.M. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5425-5430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 15Abu-Soud H.M. Hazen S.L. J. Biol.

Characterization of the LPO-Fe(II)-O2 complex, known as Compound III, generated by the addition of a slight excess of H2O2 relative to LPO native enzyme has been accomplished recently by employing techniques such as optical absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy (37Hu S. Kincaid J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 7189-7194Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 41Huwiler M. Jenzer H. Kohler H. Eur. J.

Taurog A. Dunford H.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, what role the LPO-Fe(II)-O2 complex plays during LPO catalysis is still unclear. In this study we examine the potential physiological relevance of the LPO-Fe(II)-O2 interaction. We utilize direct rapid kinetic methods to characterize O2 interactions with both forms of LPO-Fe(II). A modified comprehensive kinetic model is presented that describes LPO-Fe(II)-O2 accumulation, decay, and interaction with H2O2, as well as involvement in the catalase-like activity during steady state catalysis. Materials—O2 gas was purchased from Matheson Gas Products, Inc., and used without further purification. All other reagents and materials were of the highest purity grades available and obtained either from Sigma or from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). Bovine LPO was obtained from Worthington Bio-Chemistry Corp. (Lakewood, NJ) and used without further purification. Purity was confirmed by demonstrating a RZ of >0.75 (A415/A280), as well as by SDS-PAGE analysis. LPO concentration was determined spectrophotometrically by utilizing an extinction coefficient of 112,000 m–1 cm–1 at 412 nm (44Paul K.-G. Ohlsson P.J. Pruitt K.M. Tenovuo Y.O. The Lactoperoxidase System. 27. Dekker, New York1985: 15-30Google Scholar). Optical Spectroscopy and Rapid Kinetic Measurements—Optical spectra were recorded on a Cary 100 UV-visible spectrophotometer at 25 °C. Anaerobic spectra were recorded using septum-sealed quartz cuvettes that were attached through quick-fit joints to an all-glass vacuum train system. LPO samples were made anaerobic by several cycles of evacuation and equilibrated with catalyst-deoxygenated N2. Separate buffer solutions were evacuated, gassed with N2, and anaerobically transferred either to the stopped-flow instrument or to anaerobic cuvettes using gas-tight syringes. Cuvettes were maintained under N2 positive pressure during spectral measurements. All kinetic measurements were performed with a temperature-controlled stopped-flow apparatus (Hi-Tech Scientific, model SF-61) equipped for anaerobic work. Addition of a slight excess of dithionite to an anaerobic solution of LPO-Fe(III) initially caused rapid buildup of an unstable LPO-Fe(II) intermediate that can be characterized by its Soret absorption peak at 444 nm. This oxygenated intermediate converts slowly (t½ = ∼30 min at 10 °C) to a more stable intermediate that displays a Soret absorption peak at 432 nm. The reaction for O2 binding to both the stable and the unstable forms of LPO-Fe(II) was monitored at wavelengths determined based on the spectral changes that occur upon O2 binding to the LPO-Fe(II). Experiments were carried out at 10 °C and initiated by rapidly mixing equal volumes of the unstable form of LPO-Fe(II) (1.45 μm) (obtained immediately after reduction) with buffer solution supplemented with increasing concentrations of O2. In parallel, a similar study was repeated when a solution of the stable form of LPO-Fe(II) was rapidly mixed with a buffer solution supplemented with increasing concentrations of O2. To determine the apparent rate constants for generation of the LPO-Fe(II)-O2 complex, the time course of absorbance changes was fit to single (Y = 1 – e–kt) or double exponential (Y = Ae–k1t + Be–k2t + C) functions using a non-linear least squares method provided by the instrument manufacturer. Signal-to-noise ratios were improved by averaging 7–10 individual traces for each experiment. Solution Preparation—The molecular oxygen concentration was determined using an Apollo 4000 device (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) equipped with an O2-selective electrode. The various solutions were made by mixing different volumes of O2-saturated buffer with anaerobic buffer solutions. The O2-saturated buffer was made by bubbling O2 gas through the solution for 1 h in a septum-tipped flask. Utilizing the O2-selective electrode, the estimated ratio of the current (nA) measurement of the O2 sensor for O2-saturated and air-equilibrated buffers is ∼4.8. Using an estimated concentration of air-equilibrated buffer (21% O2) of ∼250 μm (45Truesdale G.A. Downing A.L. Nature. 1954; 173: 1236Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we calculated that the O2 concentration of O2-saturated buffer is ∼1.2 mm. These values, with the corresponding correction for temperature, were used to calculate the final O2 concentrations of all the various O2 solutions used in this study. The current for 0% oxygen concentration of the O2 sensor was adjusted prior to each measurement by adding several mg of dithionite, a strong reducing agent, per 20 ml of buffer. All the oxygen solutions were then immediately transferred to the drive syringes of the stopped-flow apparatus that were surrounded by a thermostated anaerobic water jacket to maintain a constant temperature of 10 °C. Initial Rapid Spectroscopic Characterization of O2 Binding to Ferrous LPO—To determine the role of the LPO-Fe(II)-O2 complex in catalytic activity, as well as to further our understanding of the potential role of LPO in catalase-like function, the direct reaction between LPO-Fe(II) and O2 was carried out using rapid kinetic measurements. Addition of a slight molar excess of dithionite to LPO-Fe(III) has been shown previously to cause immediate LPO heme iron reduction, as judged by a shift in the Soret absorption peak from 412 to 444 nm, and the appearance of additional absorbance peaks in the visible range at 561 and 595 nm. This intermediate is unstable and converted over a short period of time to a more stable form of LPO-Fe(II) that can be characterized based on the Soret absorbance spectrum centered at 434 nm (39Abu-Soud H.M. Hazen S.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10747-10755Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The absorption spectrum was obtained as a function of time by rapidly mixing a solution of the stable and unstable forms of LPO-Fe(II) with an equal volume of air-saturated buffer (∼250 μm O2) as shown in Fig. 1. In both cases, the formation of the LPO-Fe(II)-O2 intermediate was essentially the same and completed within 0.5 s after mixing. This intermediate has an absorption Soret peak centered at 426 nm and additional visible peaks at 549 and 588 nm (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). In both cases, the spectral changes as a function of time indicate that the reactions involve a simple one-step mechanism in which both generate a six-coordinate ferrous-dioxy complex, Compound III. The subsequent change in the absorption spectra was a result of the decay of this intermediate to ground state, which occurs through the generation of a transient intermediate whose spectrum was characterized by absorbance peaks at 416, 548, and 586 nm (Fig. 2A). This spectrum differs from that of either LPO Compound I or LPO Compound II, whose Soret absorption peaks centered at 410 and 430 nm, respectively, but is similar to that of oxyhemoglobin and nitric oxide synthase ferrous-dioxy complex (46Cassoly R.

The spectral time line in Fig. 1 is much different from that found in Fig. 2. Fig. 1A shows spectra collected at 3.4, 7.1, 22.1, 35.6, 40.1, and 44.6 s of initiating the reaction, whereas Fig. 1B shows spectra collected at 55, 56, 57, 60, 69, and 224 s of initiating the reaction.

The experiments shown are representative of three.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kinetic Analysis of O2 Binding to Ferrous LPO—We further examined the kinetics of formation of the transient intermediate species as a function of O2 concentration for both the unstable and stable forms of LPO-Fe(II) by monitoring the change in absorbance at 416 and 424 nm, respectively. Experiments were performed under pseudo-first order conditions by rapid mixing of equal volumes of LPO-Fe(II) (2 μm) with buffer solutions supplemented with different O2 concentrations. The pseudo-first order rate constants for both stable and unstable forms of LPO were identical and obtained by a fit of the data to one exponential function equation. The second order rate constants for the reaction of LPO-Fe(II) with O2 were obtained by a fit of the pseudo-order rates, determined as a function of the oxygen concentration, to one exponential function. The plot of the pseudo-first order rate constant for the initial Fe(II)-O2 complex formation was linear with a positive intercept, indicating that the reaction is reversible and proceeds through a simple one-step mechanism with kon of 3.8 × 104m–1 s–1 and koff of 11.2 s–1 (Fig. 3). The decay of the LPO-Fe(II)-O2 complex was monitored by following the absorbance changes at 460 nm. These decreases in absorbance were successfully fitted to a double exponential function with observed rates of 0.5 and 0.03 s–1. The subsequent conversion of this intermediate into the kinetically and spectroscopically distinct intermediate occurred via mechanisms independent of O2 concentration (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Subsequent decay of the LPO-O2 complex consists of two independent steps. Spectral changes were monitored at 460 nm and best fit to two exponential functions. A plot of each of the observed decay rates of LPO-Fe(II)-O2, when the stable (○) and unstable (•) forms of LPO-Fe(II) were used, is shown as a function of O2 concentration. The two lines present in the figure indicate that the complex decay under this condition was biphasic, and each step follows an irreversible O2-independent mechanism.

Its formation and decay operate to accelerate the removal of the unwanted H2O2 from the LPO milieu. This is specifically important in the human airway where catalase, a major H2O2 scavenger, exists in very low levels (50Erzurum S.C. Danel C. Gillissen A. Chu C.S. Trapnell B.C. Crystal R.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 75: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), thus leaving LPO to serve as the major H2O2 scavenger at this site. One of the most remarkable findings of the present study is the low affinity of LPO-Fe(II) toward O2 and the instability of this complex in contrast to related hemoprotein model compounds (46Cassoly R.

Under such circumstances, practically all the LPO-Fe(II)-O2 sample is converted to another oxygenated LPO species that may be formed by the influences of the positively charged heme pocket, in which weakening of the Fe–O2 bond allows the Fe to move out of the plane of the"

Purified platelet phospholipids and synthetic phospholipids retard in vitro tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)-induced fibrinolysis through effects on plasminogen activation and plasmin function. The inhibition of plasminogen activation on the surface of fibrin correlates with the fraction of anionic phospholipid. The phospholipids decrease the amount of tPA penetrating into the clot by 75% and the depth of the reactive surface layer occupied by the activator by up to 30%, whereas for plasmin both of these parameters decrease by ∼50%. The phospholipids are not only a diffusion barrier, they also bind the components of the fibrinolytic system. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows binding characterized with dissociation constants in the range 0.35-7.64 μm for plasmin and tPA (lower values with more negative phospholipids). The interactions are endothermic and thermodynamically driven by an increase in entropy, probably caused by the rearrangements in the ordered gel structure of the phospholipids (in line with the stronger inhibition at gel phase temperatures compared with liquid crystalline phase temperatures). These findings show a phospholipid barrier, which should be overcome during lysis of arterial thrombi.

The basis of the current thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke is the administration of plasminogen activators (e.g. tPA 1The abbreviations used are: tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; α2-PI, α2-plasmin inhibitor; PC, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine; PS, dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine; poPC, palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DPH, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene; DHPS, dihexanoylphosphatidylserine; LUV, large unilamellar phospholipid vesicle; PCPS3:1, LUV containing PC and PS mixed at 3:1 weight ratio; PCPS1:1, LUV containing PC and PS mixed at 1:1 weight ratio; poPCPS, LUV containing poPC, PC and PS mixed at 2:3:5 weight ratio; poPCPS1:1, LUV containing poPC and PS mixed at 1:1 weight ratio; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. 1The abbreviations used are: tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; α2-PI, α2-plasmin inhibitor; PC, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine; PS, dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine; poPC, palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DPH, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene; DHPS, dihexanoylphosphatidylserine; LUV, large unilamellar phospholipid vesicle; PCPS3:1, LUV containing PC and PS mixed at 3:1 weight ratio; PCPS1:1, LUV containing PC and PS mixed at 1:1 weight ratio; poPCPS, LUV containing poPC, PC and PS mixed at 2:3:5 weight ratio; poPCPS1:1, LUV containing poPC and PS mixed at 1:1 weight ratio; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. and its recombinant variants), which convert the plasminogen in blood plasma or on the surface of the thrombi to plasmin and the latter dissolves fibrin, the solid matrix of thrombi (1Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, persistent recanalization of the occluded blood vessels often fails (in 15-40% of patients), and efficient doses of thrombolytics have significant bleeding side effects (2Verstraete M. Sasahara A.A. Loscalzo J.L. New Therapeutic Agents in Thrombosis and Thrombolysis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2003: 477-478Google Scholar). The limitations of existing fibrinolytic therapy indicate that thrombolysis is not identical to fibrinolysis and direct attention to the variety of cellular and molecular factors present in thrombi that modulate the function of the basal fibrinolytic machinery (recently reviewed in Ref. 3Kolev K. Machovich R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Platelets render thrombi resistant to lysis with tPA (4Jang I.K. Gold H.K. Ziskind A.A. Fallon J.T. Holt R.E. Leinbach R.C. May J.W. Collen D. Circulation. 1989; 79: 920-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), which can be partially explained by their PAI-1 content (5Booth N.A. Simpson A.J. Croll A. Bennett B. MacGregor I.R. Br. J. Haematol. 1988; 70: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), but evidence for PAI-1-independent inhibition of fibrinolysis also exists (6Fay W.P. Eitzman D.T. Shapiro A.D. Madison E.L. Ginsburg D. Blood. 1994; 83: 351-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When arterial thrombi are formed, the platelet content of 10 ml of whole blood is compacted in a volume of 400 μl, whereas the fibrin content of the same thrombi corresponds to the fibrinogen concentration in blood plasma (7McBane II, R.D. Ford M.A.P. Karnicki K. Stewart M. Owen W.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the intrathrombus plasminogen (0.4 μm), and α2-PI (0.25 μm) concentrations are just fractions of the respective plasma values (8Robbie L.A. Bennett B. Croll A.M. Brown P.A.J. Booth N.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). After activation, the platelets release their cytosolic content and lose the majority of their phospholipid (9Skarlatos S.I. Rao R. Dickens B.F. Kruth H.S. Virchows Arch. 1993; 64: 241-245Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). By taking into account the average amount of phospholipids in platelets (10Schick P.K. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Salzman E.W. Hemostasis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1994: 574-589Google Scholar), the phospholipid content of arterial thrombi (7.5 g/liter) is expected to be higher than their fibrin content (1.7 g/liter). Phospholipids are known to bind fibrinogen and to modify the proteolytic susceptibility of fibrin(ogen) to thrombin and plasmin (11Cook B.C. Retzinger G.S. J. Colloid. Interface Sci. 1994; 162: 171-181Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Günther A. Kalinowski M. Elssner A. Seeger W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L618-L624PubMed Google Scholar, 13Retzinger G.S.

Biol. 1999; 21: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The contribution of the platelet phospholipids to discrete steps of blood coagulation is well characterized (reviewed in Refs. 17Zwaal R.F.A. Schroit A.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 18Lentz B.R. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 423-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), but data on the functional consequences with respect to fibrinolysis are rather controversial. Higher proteolytic susceptibility to plasmin has been reported for monomeric fibrinogen layers on phospholipid surfaces (11Cook B.C. Retzinger G.S. J. Colloid. Interface Sci. 1994; 162: 171-181Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but data for inhibited degradation of fibrinogen (19Günther A. Bleyl H. Seeger W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L186-L192PubMed Google Scholar) and fibrin (12Günther A. Kalinowski M. Elssner A. Seeger W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L618-L624PubMed Google Scholar) are also available. In addition to the controversies at the substrate end of fibrinolysis, the phospholipid modulation of the enzymes involved in this process is scarcely investigated. The only definite observation in this respect is the phospholipid-induced enhancement of tPA inactivation by PAI-1 (20Lambers J.W.J. Cammenga M. König B.W. Mertens K. Pannekoek H. van Mourik J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17492-17496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Generally the interaction of a protein and a phospholipid bi-layer depends on the electric charge of the polar head in the lipid molecule (varying electrostatic attraction/repulsion) and the lamellar phase structure of the lipid layer (varying hydrophobic interactions related to membrane fluidity and rearrangements) (21Surewicz W.K. Epand R.M. Pownall H.J. Hui S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16191-16197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The known phospholipid composition of the human platelet membrane (22Mahadevappa V.G. Holub B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 713: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) indicates high heterogeneity considering both of these factors. The platelet membranes are dominated by the zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylethanolamine (83 mol % of total phospholipid) with a significant fraction of anionic phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol (17 mol %). The differently charged phospholipids are localized asymmetrically in the inner and outer layers of the platelet membrane (negatively charged polar heads predominantly in the inner leaflet at rest). Upon activation, however, extensive anionic patches are formed on the outer surface (reviewed in Refs. 17Zwaal R.F.A. Schroit A.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 18Lentz B.R. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 423-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The type of lamellar phase structure adopted by phospholipid membranes at a given temperature is basically determined by the type of their fatty acids (reviewed in Ref. 23Crowe J.H. Tablin F. Tsvetkova N. Oliver A.E. Walker N. Crowe L.M. Cryobiology. 1999; 38: 180-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and considering the 40% contribution of unsaturated fatty acids to the total acyl moieties in platelet phospholipids (22Mahadevappa V.G. Holub B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 713: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the platelet membrane is expected to be in the fluid lamellar phase. The presence of proteins, however, and their dynamic changes in the course of cellular function allow for the formation of lateral phospholipid domains in the distinct phase state, which has been shown in thrombin-activated platelets (24Nathan I. Fleischer G. Livne A. Dvilansky A. Parola A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9822-9828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and other cells (25Rodgers W. Glaser M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1364-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26Prenner E. Sommer A. Kungl A. Stütz H. Friedl H. Hermetter A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), but similar lateral domains can be reproduced in vitro in pure phospholipid membranes with variations of composition and temperature (27Luna E.J. McConnel H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 470: 303-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because of this lateral heterogeneity of platelet membranes with respect to both electric charge and phase state, any in vitro approach designed to analyze their interaction with proteins should utilize multiple experimental settings suitable to model each discrete structural aspect of the interaction. In our present study we model the contribution of polar head charge using gel phase mixtures (at 37 °C) of PC and PS, the Tm of which is in the range 41-45 °C (where Tm is melting temperature of the phospholipid, defined as the average value of the temperatures at the beginning and the completion of the transition from gel to the liquid-like phase) (27Luna E.J. McConnel H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 470: 303-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We evaluate the role of the phospholipid crystalline phase in interactions with members of the fibrinolytic system at a defined temperature (25 or 37 °C) by using variations in the unsaturated fatty acid content of the applied phospholipid. The presence of 8-24% poPC decreases the Tm of pure PC membranes from 41 to 35-32 °C, and thus the membrane with such a ratio of poPC is in the gel phase at 25 °C and in the liquid-crystalline phase at 37 °C (23Crowe J.H. Tablin F. Tsvetkova N. Oliver A.E. Walker N. Crowe L.M. Cryobiology. 1999; 38: 180-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). One advantage of work with binary mixtures of phospholipids (zwitterionic/anionic, saturated/unsaturated acyl derivatives) is that these contain lipid clusters resembling the domains in natural membranes (reviewed in Refs. 28Lee A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 472: 237-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar and 29Hazel J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The boundary regions of such clusters (order-disorder boundaries) give rise to some pre-melting phenomena even at temperatures far from the Tm, e.g. increased permeability (28Lee A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 472: 237-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), increased rate of protein binding (30Pownall H.J. Massey J.B. Kusserow S.K. Gotto Jr., A.M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and increased enthalpy of binding (31Epand R.M. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20829-20832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binary systems, of course, are simplified models of the natural complex membranes, but they allow the dissection of the discrete effects of the separate phospholipid components. Materials—Human plasma and platelet concentrates were collected from healthy volunteers (Hungarian Blood Supply Service, Budapest, Hungary). Human fibrinogen (plasminogen-free) and FITC on Celite were from Calbiochem. The chromogenic plasmin substrate Spectrozyme-PL (H-d-norleucyl-hexahydrotyrosyl-lysine-p-nitroanilide) and the tPA were products of American Diagnostica (Hartford, CT) and Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany, respectively. Human thrombin (1000 NIH units·mg-1), α2-PI, PC, PS, poPC, N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, BSA, DPH, Nile Blue A, and p-nitrophenyl p′-guanidinobenzoate were from Sigma. DHPS was from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). 4-(2-Aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF, Pefabloc®) was from Roche Applied Science. Published procedures were used for the isolation of Glu-plasminogen from citrated human plasma (32Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar) as well as for the generation of plasmin and determination of its active concentration (33Kolev K. Léránt I. Tenekejiev K. Machovich R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17030-17034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were labeled with Eu3+ chelate (N1-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-diethylenetriamine-N1,N2,N3,N4-tetraacetic acid chelated with Eu3+) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Wallac, Turku, Finland) with efficiency of 1-2 Eu3+/molecule of protein (determined by using the europium standard solution from Wallac). The Eu3+ label binds covalently to primary amino groups of the proteins. The detection sensitivity of the label is similar to that of radioisotopes (34Inglese J. Samama P. Patel S. Burbaum J. Stroke I.L. Appel K.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2372-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Proteins were labeled with FITC using a published procedure (35Rinderknecht H. Nature. 1962; 193: 167-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) yielding ∼2 FITC labels/molecule of protein (on the basis of the A495/A280 ratio). Neither of the two labels altered the functional properties of the plasminogen, tPA, and plasmin as evidenced by plasminogen activation and turbidimetric fibrinolytic assays performed according to published procedures (36Kolev K. Owen W.G. Machovich R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 37Kolev K. Komorowicz E. Owen W.G. Machovich R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Preparation of LUVs—PC, PS, and poPC were weighed, mixed at the desired mass ratio, and dissolved in chloroform/methanol (95:5 volume ratio). Following evaporation of the solvent, the phospholipids were suspended with brief sonication (three times for 30 s with a 50-watt, 20-kHz, Branson Sonifier 250, Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, buffer containing 150 mm NaCl (Buffer A, in which all reactions were carried out unless otherwise stated), and LUVs were prepared with extrusion through a 50-nm pore diameter polycarbonate filter in a Liposofast mini-extruder (Avestin Inc., Ottawa, Canada) (38MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P.M. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). The concentration of phospholipids in the LUV suspension was determined with the fluorescent probe DPH (39Jouanel P. Motta C. Delattre J. Dastugue B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1980; 105: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Preparation of Platelet Membrane Lipids—Platelet membranes were prepared from human platelet concentrates according to the glycerol lysis procedure (40Harmon J.T. Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Following the hyperosmotic/hypo-osmotic shock, the unlysed platelets were sonicated three times for 30 s (50 watts, 20 kHz), and this fraction was used as a crude platelet homogenate. The phospholipids were extracted from the membranes with chloroform with continuous rotation (40 rpm) for 6 h at 40 °C. The chloroform fraction was separated from the water phase. Following evaporation of the chloroform, the lipids were suspended in Buffer A; LUVs were prepared, and their phospholipid content was determined as described for the synthetic phospholipids (with this procedure 1 unit of platelet concentrate yielded 1 ml of protein-free lipid suspension containing ∼0.6 g/liter phospholipid). Turbidimetric Fibrinolytic Assay—This was carried out as described previously (37Kolev K. Komorowicz E. Owen W.G. Machovich R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of 6 μm fibrinogen containing 0.25 or 0.5 μm plasminogen and the examined LUVs at various concentrations was clotted with 0.5 NIH units/ml thrombin in microplate wells at 37 °C for 45 min. The dissolution of the clots was induced by 100 μl of 3-140 nm tPA applied on the surface of the clot, and 60 μl of mineral oil was layered over the solution to prevent evaporation. The course of clot formation and dissolution was monitored by measuring the light attenuance at 340 nm at 25 or 37 °C with a Zenyth 200rt microplate spectrophotometer (Anthos Labtec Instruments GmbH, Salzburg, Austria). The lysis time (t½) defined as the time needed to reduce the turbidity of the clot to half-maximal value was used as a quantitative parameter of fibrinolytic activity. Plasminogen Activation Assays—Plasminogen activation in homogeneous solution was evaluated as described previously (36Kolev K. Owen W.G. Machovich R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 μm plasminogen containing the examined LUVs at various concentrations was mixed with 70 nm tPA. Samples were taken at intervals, and the amidolytic activity of the generated plasmin was measured on 0.1 mm Spectrozyme-PL. Plasminogen activation in the presence of fibrin was measured on the surface of clear fibrin clots (A405 <0.1) (41Longstaff C. Whitton C.M. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 2: 1416-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) prepared in standard 96-well microtiter plates from 20 μl of 10 NIH units/ml thrombin and 60 μl of 4.4 μm fibrinogen in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, 0.1 μm plasminogen, and the examined LUVs at various concentrations. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C 60 μl of 14 nm tPA in Buffer A and 0.6 mm Spectrozyme-PL were layered on the clot surface followed by 60 μl of mineral oil. The light attenuance at 405 nm (A405) indicating the release of p-nitroaniline by the generated plasmin was continuously recorded with a Zenyth 200rt microplate spectrophotometer at 37 °C. The measured A405 values are plotted versus time-squared yielding a linear relationship with a slope directly proportional to the rate of plasminogen activation (42Ranby M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 704: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Determination of the Second-order Rate Constant for the Inactivation of Plasmin by α2-PI—This was carried out as described previously by using equimolar concentrations of titrated plasmin and α2-PI (33Kolev K. Léránt I. Tenekejiev K. Machovich R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17030-17034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the absence and presence of 1 g/liter poPCPS. Penetration of Proteins into Fibrin Clots—To measure the depth of the reactive layer, fibrin was prepared in 0.5-mm high chambers constructed from glass slides by clotting 2 g/liter fibrinogen in Buffer A, 3 mm CaCl2, and 1 g/liter PCPS1:1 or PCPS3:1 with 2 NIH units/ml thrombin for 30 min. Thereafter, FITC-tPA or FITC-plasmin (in the same buffer containing 5 mm Pefabloc) was added to the edge of the clot, and the FITC label was monitored with the confocal laser scanning system LSM510 (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany) taking sequential images of the fluid-fibrin interface at a distance of ∼50 μm from the glass surface with identical exposures and laser intensities (attenuated to 7% of the full intensity) for all examined conditions. The size of the layer, into which the labeled proteins penetrate, was measured on the digital images with SigmaGel 1.0 software (Jandel Scientific, Erkrath, Germany). To measure the amount of diffusing protein, fibrin clots of 100 μl volume and the same composition as described above were prepared in microtiter plates. Thereafter, Eu3+-labeled protein (in 50 μl of Buffer A containing 5 mm Pefabloc) was added to the surface of the clots, and various intervals were allowed for diffusion and binding, at the end of which the fluid phase over the clot was thoroughly removed. Following washing (less than 5 s) of the fibrin surface with 100 μl of Buffer A, 200 μl of Enhancement Solution (Wallac, Turku, Finland), which releases the Eu3+ from the proteins and forms the fluorescent chelate, was added. The emission fluorescence of Eu3+ was measured after 4 h with a time-resolved microplate fluorimeter Victor2 (Wallac, Turku, Finland) (excitation wavelength 340 nm, emission wavelength 615 nm, counting delay 400 μs). By using this fluorescent data and the known specific label in the added protein, the amount of tPA or plasmin retained in the clot was calculated. Binding of Eu3+-labeled Proteins to Fibrin Monomers—Standard 96-well microplates were coated with fibrin monomers and BSA as described previously (33Kolev K. Léránt I. Tenekejiev K. Machovich R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17030-17034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 100 μl of 10 nm Eu3+-plasminogen, Eu3+-plasmin (active site blocked with Pefabloc), or Eu3+-tPA was applied to the protein-coated surface in the absence and the presence of varying concentrations PCPS1:1 LUVs. After 10 min of incubation at 25 °C, the solution was removed, and the plates were washed three times (in less than 10 s) with 200 μl of Buffer A. 200 μl of Enhancement Solution was added, and the Eu3+ fluorescence was measured as above. Sedimentation Analysis of LUV-Protein Complexes—LUVs (0.5 g/liter) were mixed with Eu3+-plasminogen, Eu3+-plasmin, or Eu3+-tPA (1 μm) in Buffer A and 5 mm Pefabloc and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. Thereafter, 100 μl of each mixture were centrifuged at 100,000 × g in an Airfuge (Beckman Instruments Inc., Palo Alto, CA) for 15 min. The amount of Eu3+ label in the upper 40 μl of the supernatant was measured (no phospholipid could be detected with the DPH probe in this fraction). Biomolecular Interaction Analysis—The interaction of phospholipids and proteins (plasmin(ogen), tPA) was evaluated with SPR technology on Biacore X system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) (43O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burk M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 323-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Sensor chip L1 (carboxymethylated dextran matrix modified with lipophilic substance) was used to immobilize phospholipid LUVs, whereas Sensor chip HPA (long chain alkanethiol surface) was used to form a phospholipid monolayer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—The enthalpy changes accompanying the interaction of phospholipids and proteins were measured using isothermal titration method on VP-ITC microcalorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA) (44Wiseman T. Williston S. Brands J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar, 45Fisher H.F. Singh N. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 194-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The proteins were injected in a series of 25 aliquots (10 μl each) into the cell of the calorimeter containing LUVs, and the heat increment of each addition was recorded by the instrument. Dilutions of protein into buffer were carried out in a separate series of injections, and these heat increments were subtracted from the raw data (these background peaks were significantly larger than the titration heats of buffer into buffer only for the injection of 0.14 mm plasmin at 37 °C). The heat data from the injection of proteins into LUV suspension were evaluated according to the single-site algorithm (46Indyk L. Fisher H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295: 350-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with ITC Data Analysis version 7.0 software (Microcal). Staining of Phospholipids with Nile Blue—Frozen sections of thrombi removed with surgery (kindly collected by Dr. András Nagy at the 1st Department of Surgery, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary) from human femoral artery were stained for phospholipids (47Smith J.L. J. Pathol. Bacteriol. 1908; 12: 1-4Crossref Google Scholar). 1 h of pretreatment with 1 n HCl followed by 1 h of incubation in acetone was used to eliminate the triglycerides and sterols. Thereafter, the sections were immersed in 10 g/liter Nile Blue in water for 5 min, rinsed with water, and destained with 0.1 n HCl. The phospholipids stain blue with this procedure. For comparison, fibrin clots were prepared from 4 g/liter fibrinogen containing 5 g/liter PCPS3:1 clotted with 10 NIH units/ml thrombin for 24 h at 37 °C, and these were sectioned and stained with the same procedure (control clots prepared without phospholipids did not yield any color reaction). Nile Blue staining of thrombi from human femoral artery shows massive presence of phospholipids (Fig. 1). The intensity of the phospholipid stain in the thrombus sections is comparable with that in the fibrin clots containing 5 g/liter phospholipid. The dimensions of the phospholipid clusters correspond to the size of platelets. When the effect of crude platelet homogenates on tPA-induced fibrin dissolution is evaluated in vitro, significant retardation is seen (Fig. 2), which at first glance can be explained with the known PAI-1 content of platelets (5Booth N.A. Simpson A.J. Croll A. Bennett B. MacGregor I.R. Br. J. Haematol. 1988; 70: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However, at equivalent concentrations, the platelet homogenate does not inhibit the generation of plasmin by tPA in a homogeneous, fibrin-free assay system (not shown). This inhibiting effect in the fibrinolytic assay is partially reproduced by LUVs prepared from protein-free platelet membranes or from synthetic poPCPS at identical phospholipid concentrations and is completely reconstituted with higher phospholipid contents of the clot (Fig. 2A). The degree of inhibition markedly decreases at 37 °C (Fig. 2B). The maximal inhibiting effect is achieved at phospholipid concentration of 1 g/liter (Fig. 2B, inset), but if water-soluble DHPS, which does not form membrane structures, is used in the fibrinolytic assay instead of LUVs, no inhibition of the dissolution process is observed at concentrations up to 4.5 g/liter (not shown). The inhibiting effect of 1 g/liter poPCPS is equivalent to the effect of 440 nm α2-PI present in the fibrin (Fig. 3), and these two independent actions are additive in the fib"

The IMP also has at least one noncatalytic subunit, Som1p, which is required to cleave signal peptides from a subset of Imp1p substrates. To understand how Som1p mediates Imp1p substrate specificity, we addressed the possibility that Som1p functions as a molecular chaperone, which binds to specific substrates and directs them to the catalytic site. Our results show that cargo sequences attached to the signal peptide are important for Som1p-dependent presequence cleavage; however, no specific cargo sequence is required. Indeed, we show that a substrate normally destined for Imp2p is cleaved in a Som1p-dependent manner when the substrate is directed to Imp1p. These results argue against the notion that Som1p is a molecular chaperone. Instead, we propose that the cargo of some Imp1p substrates can assume a conformation incompatible with presequence cleavage. Som1p could thus act through Imp1p to improve cleavage efficiency early during substrate maturation.

Mitochondria consist of two hydrophobic compartments, the outer and inner membranes, and two hydrophilic compartments, the matrix and intermembrane space, which hold proteins that perform important cellular functions including oxidative phosphorylation, tri-carboxylic acid cycle, and fatty acid oxidation (1Morgan-Hughes J.A. Engel A.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Myology. 2nd Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1994: 1610-1660Google Scholar). Among the hundreds of proteins that reside within the mitochondrial compartments, only 13 (in human) or 8 (in yeast) are encoded by the mitochondrial genome. All other proteins are encoded within the nucleus and translated in the cytoplasm. To achieve mitochondrial targeting, many proteins have N-terminal signal peptides that must be cleaved following membrane translocation. The mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) 1The abbreviations used are: MPP, mitochondrial processing peptidase; IMP, inner membrane protease; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; cyt, cytochrome; red, reductase; pre-Gut2p, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase precursor; pre-Cox2p, pre-cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: MPP, mitochondrial processing peptidase; IMP, inner membrane protease; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; cyt, cytochrome; red, reductase; pre-Gut2p, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase precursor; pre-Cox2p, pre-cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2; HA, hemagglutinin. cleaves the signal peptides from most of these proteins (2Verner K. Schatz. G. Science. 1988; 241: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A smaller set of mitochondrial proteins has a signal peptide required for sorting to the intermembrane space and inner membrane following mitochondrial targeting and translocation. This signal peptide is cleaved by the inner membrane peptidase (IMP).Study of the IMP in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has revealed three distinct subunits, Imp1p, Imp2p, and Som1p (3Pratje E.

Esser K. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Imp1p and Imp2p are catalytic subunits and members of the type I signal peptidase family, which includes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal peptidase, chloroplast thylakoid processing peptidase, and many eubacterial signal peptidases (6Paetzel M.

Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Imp1p cleaves signal peptides from nuclearly encoded cytochrome b2 precursor (p-cyt b2), the precursor to NADH-cytochrome-b5 reductase (pre-cyt b5-red), the precursor to glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (pre-Gut2p) and mitochondrially encoded pre-cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 (pre-Cox2p) (3Pratje E.

Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Nonoverlapping substrate specificity derives in large part from the fact that Imp1p does not follow the “–3, –1 rule” in which small uncharged amino acids are required at the P3 and P1 positions in signal peptide cleavage sites (10von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar). Instead, Imp1p tolerates a variety of amino acid residues at the P1 position and requires a negatively charged residue at the P′1 position in its substrates (11Chen X. VanValkenburgh C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Luo W. Chen X. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4943-4948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).The third IMP subunit, Som1p, binds to Imp1p and is required for signal peptide cleavage from two Imp1p substrates, pre-cyt b5-red and pre-Cox2p (5Jan P.-S.

This behavior indicates that noncatalytic subunit Som1p exerts a novel level of IMP substrate specificity, one that differentiates between Imp1p substrates. Here, we consider whether Som1p is a molecular chaperone that binds to specific substrates and delivers them to Imp1p.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Plasmids, Media, and Antibodies—Yeast strains used in this study were BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) (Invitrogen), HFY501 (MATa som1::LEU2 his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) (prepared for this study), XCY101 (MATα imp1::HIS3 ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 suc2-Δ9 lys2–80) (11Chen X.

VanValkenburgh C. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This mutation results in a S41A substitution that inhibits Imp2p catalytic activity but allows Imp2p to be expressed and bind to Imp1p. Binding of Imp2p to Imp1p is needed to stabilize Imp1p in yeast cells (4Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Media used to support yeast cell growth have been described previously (14Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Anti-HA high affinity rat monoclonal antibody and protein G-conjugated agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) were used for immunoprecipitation.Disruption of SOM1 Gene—Oligonucleotides containing sequences flanking the SOM1 and the LEU2 genes were used to amplify the LEU2 gene using PCR. PCR product was introduced into strain BY4741 with selection for Leu-positive colonies. Recombination of the LEU2 gene into the SOM1 chromosomal locus was then confirmed by diagnostic PCR. The disruption removed the entire SOM1 open reading frame from the genome of strain BY4741.Construction of HA-tagged Proteins—A DNA segment encoding three consecutive HA epitopes (15Wilson I.A.

Genes encoding mutant and fusion proteins without translational stop codons were synthesized using two-step PCR (16Liang H. VanValkenburgh C. Chen X. Mullins C. Van Kaer L. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol.

The genes were then inserted into the above mentioned plasmids between the ADH1 promotor (17Bennetzen J.L. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3018-3025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the DNA segment encoding the triple HA epitopes. Sequences of oligonucleotides used in this study are available on request.Pulse Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Methods similar to those described previously were used (14Mullins C. Lu Y. Campbell A. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17139-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown at 30 °C to log phase (A600 = 1.5) in appropriate media. Cells were then shifted to media lacking methionine and cysteine for 1 h and pulse-labeled for 10 min with 60 μCi/ml [35S]Met (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were harvested and broken by glass beads. Total proteins were precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min. This mixture was diluted with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline/Triton X-100 (0.1%), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The protein solution was incubated overnight with 1.6 μg/ml anti-HA antibodies at 4 °C. This incubation was followed by incubation (2 h) with 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science). Protein G beads were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline/Triton X-100 (0.1%) and then twice with distilled water. 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the protein-bead slurry. The mixture was placed in a boiling water bath (5 min) and loaded onto an SDS-gel.RESULTSCargo Sequences Influence Som1p-dependent Presequence Cleavage—Som1p is needed for Imp1p cleavage of pre-cyt b5-red but not p-cyt b2 (5Jan P.-S. Esser K. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Based on this difference, we reasoned that pre-cyt b5-red has a sequence, which is not present in p-cyt b2, that is responsible for Som1p-dependent cleavage. To determine whether the putative sequence is located within the presequence or cargo of pre-cyt b5-red, we constructed a chimera that contained the cargo of pre-cyt b5-red fused to the presequence of p-cyt b2. The p-cyt b2 presequence is actually composed of two signal peptides fused together in tandem (18Guiard B. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3265-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). MPP cleaves a mitochondrial targeting signal peptide to generate i-cyt b2, and then Imp1p cleaves the second signal peptide to generate mature cyt b2. The p-cyt b2/cyt b5-red chimera, tagged with three HA epitopes at its C terminus, was expressed in strains BY4741 (wild type) and HFY501 (Δsom1). Yeast strain genotypes can be found under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were then subjected to a 10-min pulse with radio-labeled methionine, and proteins were precipitated from cell extracts with anti-HA antibodies (see under “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1, cleavage of i-cyt b2 signal peptide from i-cyt b2/cyt b5-red was Som1p-dependent. Because this signal peptide can be cleaved from the cyt b2 cargo independently of Som1p (5Jan P.-S. Esser K. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the data support the notion that amino acid sequences located within the cargo of pre-cyt b5-red are important for Som1p-dependent cleavage.Som1p Facilitates Imp1p Substrate Recognition without Requirement for a Specific Substrate Sequence—We next sought to identify specific cargo sequences involved in presequence cleavage from the p-cyt b2/cyt b5-red chimera. To this end, we introduced distinct internal and C-terminal deletions into the cyt b5-red cargo (Fig. 2A) and expressed the constructs in strains BY4741 (wild type) and HFY501 (Δsom1). Cells were then examined by pulse labeling as described above. To our surprise, the mutated forms of i-cyt b2/cyt b5-red were cleaved in a Som1p-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that no specific cargo sequence is required for Som1p-dependent cleavage. Cleavage efficiency, however, was reduced when a region immediately flanking the Imp1p cleavage site was removed from the chimera (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). To examine this region in more detail, we designed a new set of constructs containing smaller internal deletions (10 or 11 amino acids) (Fig. 3A). As shown by pulse labeling, Som1p clearly was needed to cleave signal peptides from this new set of mutant chimeras (Fig. 3B). These results thus suggest that no specific cargo sequence is required for Som1p-dependent substrate cleavage, although it is plausible that deletion of cargo residues located near the cleavage site affect the conformation of the cleavage site and thus partially inhibit presequence cleavage in some protein contexts.Fig. 2Partial deletion of cyt b5 -red cargo does not block the Som1p-dependent signal peptide cleavage of p-cyt b2/cyt b5-red.A, design of internal and C-terminal deletions of cyt b5-red cargo are shown. Dashed lines represent the deleted regions. B, HA-tagged p-cyt b2/cyt b5-red constructs were expressed in strains BY4741 (WT, wild type) (odd-numbered lanes) and HFY501 (Δsom1) (even-numbered lanes), and strains were subjected to pulse labeling as described in Fig. 1. Proteins were resolved on a SDS-10% gel (lanes 1–10) or a SDS-12% gel (lanes 11–12).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Deletion of cargo residues next to the Imp1p cleavage site in the p-cyt b2/cyt b5-red chimera does not prevent Som1p-dependent cleavage.A, design of short internal deletions of cyt b5-red cargo is shown.

Proteins were resolved by a SDS-10% gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we examined the role of cargo sequences using p-cyt b5-red, a natural Imp1p substrate. This protein is identical to the above-mentioned chimera with respect to the cargo sequence but differs, of course, in presequence composition. A series of internal and C-terminal deletions was constructed in the p-cyt b5-red cargo (Fig. 4A), and Imp1p cleavage was examined in cells that have or lack Som1p. Although most of the mutations did not prevent Som1p-dependent cleavage (Fig. 4B), residues located close to the cleavage site were important (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). These residues were nonessential for presequence cleavage in the chimeric protein context (Fig. 2B), suggesting that cargo residues located near the cleavage site can affect presequence cleavage in some protein contexts. Taken together, our data suggest that no specific cargo sequence is required for Som1p-dependent presequence cleavage.Fig. 4Cargo sequences are not important for Som1p-dependent processing of p-cyt b5-red except those flanking the cleavage site.A, design of cargo deletions in p-cyt b5-red is shown. B, HA-tagged p-cyt b5-red constructs were expressed in strains BY4741 (WT, wild type) (odd-numbered lanes) and HFY501 (Δsom1) (even-numbered lanes), and strains were subjected to pulse labeling as described in Fig. 1. Proteins were resolved on a SDS-10% gel (lanes 1–10) or SDS-12% gel (lanes 11–12). *, p-cyt b5-red molecules that were transported to the ER and glycosylated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)p-Cyt b5-red Can Be Directed to Both the Mitochondria and ER—Fig. 4B depicts protein bands (*) with molecular weights that are greater than that of p-cyt b5-red. These bands disappear when yeast cells are treated with tunicamycin prior to the pulse (data not shown). Tunicamycin inhibits Asn-linked glycosylation in the ER (19Mullins C. Meyer H.-A. Hartmann E. Green N. Fang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29094-29099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), indicating that the bands with greater molecular mass represent p-cyt b5-red that has been directed to the ER and glycosylated. This conclusion is supported by our inspection of the p-cyt b5-red sequence, which identified four consensus Asn-linked glycosylation sites. We also observed differently sized glycosylated protein bands with different cargo deletions (Fig. 4B, compare lane 5 with lane 7). This result is consistent with deletion of one or more of the consensus glycosylation sites. The data presented in Fig. 4B thus demonstrate that p-cyt b5-red can be targeted both to mitochondria and the ER. Our data further suggest that the p-cyt b5-red presequence but not the p-cyt b2 presequence exhibits this novel dual targeting, because glycosylated cyt b5-red cargo was not seen when the presequence of p-cyt b2 was used to target the p-cyt b2/cyt b5-red chimera to mitochondria (Fig. 2B). The p-cyt b5-red presequence has a rather long hydrophobic stretch consisting of ∼20 amino acid residues (8Hahne K. Haucke V. Ramage L. Schatz G. Cell. 1994; 79: 829-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This unusually long hydrophobic stretch is probably responsible for ER targeting, whereas distinct uncharacterized sequences in the p-cyt b5-red presequence are likely to be responsible for mitochondrial targeting. We do not know whether ER targeting occurs naturally in yeast cells that express wild type p-cyt b5-red, and it has not been reported previously. However, our overexpression of p-cyt b5-red using the ADH1 promotor to facilitate protein detection (see under “Experimental Procedures”) may contribute to the ER targeting seen in this study.A Mutant Form of p-Cyt c1 Can Be Cleaved in a Som1p-dependent Manner—Previous work from our laboratory showed that Imp2p substrate p-cyt c1 could be switched to Imp1p when the P3, P1, and P′1 residues of p-cyt c1 were changed to Ile, Asn, and Glu (INE), respectively (12Luo W. Chen X. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4943-4948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The presequence of p-cyt c1 consists of a bipartite signal peptide (20Sadler I. Suda K. Schatz G. Kaudewitz F. Haid A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). MPP cleavage of p-cyt c1 generates i-cyt c1, and IMP cleavage of i-cyt c1 generates cyt c1. To determine whether Som1p is needed for cleavage of i-cyt c1 when it is switched to Imp1p, we prepared a DNA construct encoding a truncated form of p-cyt c1 (p-cyt c1(INE)), lacking its C-terminal 87 residues, a region that includes the transmembrane segment of i-cyt c1 (20Sadler I. Suda K. Schatz G. Kaudewitz F. Haid A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We employed this truncation to facilitate detection of the protein, because the truncated protein was expressed at higher levels than full-length p-cyt c1 in yeast mitochondria (data not shown).The p-cyt c1(INE) was expressed in strains BY4741 (wild type), XCY101 (Δimp1), HFY501 (Δsom1), and JN34 (Δimp2)/pXC3. Plasmid pXC3 carries a mutation that results in a S41A substitution in the Imp2p protein. This mutation inhibits Imp2p catalytic activity but allows Imp2p to bind to and stabilize Imp1p (11Chen X.

As such, strain JN34/pXC3 has Imp1p activity but no Imp2p activity. As shown by pulse labeling (Fig. 5), i-cyt c1(INE) was processed by Imp1p but not by Imp2p (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3). This result is consistent with our previous study, which showed that full-length i-cyt c1 could be switched from Imp2p to Imp1p by incorporating INE residues at the cleavage site (12Luo W. Chen X. Fang H. Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4943-4948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Importantly, when Imp1p cleaved i-cyt c1(INE), it did so in a Som1p-dependent manner (Fig. 5, compare lane 2 with lane 4). As Imp2p does not need Som1p to cleave wild type i-cyt c1 (5Jan P.-S. Esser K. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it is highly unlikely that i-cyt c1(INE) would have a sequence that interacts with Som1p only when Imp1p cleaves the precursor artificially as a result of mutation at the presequence cleavage site. Thus, taken together with data presented above, our results strongly argue against a model in which Som1p directly interacts with an Imp1p substrate to facilitate its cleavage.Fig. 5Signal peptide of p-cyt c1(INE) is cleaved by Imp1p in a Som1p-dependent manner. Truncated p-cyt c1(INE) (residues 1–222) tagged with three HA epitopes was expressed in strains BY4741 (WT, wild type), JNY34 (Δimp2)/pXC3 (Imp1p), XCY101 (Δimp1) (Imp2p), and HFY501 (Δsom1) (lanes 1–4, respectively). Cells were subjected to a 10-min pulse, and proteins were precipitated using anti-HA antibodies. Proteins were resolved using a SDS-12% gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further support our conclusion that cargo sequences are important for Imp1p substrate cleavage, we designed a fusion protein that contained the bipartite presequence of p-cyt c1(INE) fused to the cyt b2 cargo. The signal peptide of i-cyt c1(INE) is cleaved in a Som1p-dependent manner (Fig. 5), whereas the signal peptide of i-cyt b2 is cleaved in a Som1p-independent manner (5Jan P.-S. Esser K. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We reasoned that, if cargo sequences dictate Som1p-dependence, the i-cyt c1(INE)/cyt b2 chimera would be cleaved independently of Som1p. To test this idea, the chimera was expressed in strains BY4741 (wild type), JN34 (Δimp2)/pXC3, XCY101 (Δimp1), and HFY501 (Δsom1), and cells were subjected to pulse labeling. As shown in Fig. 6, the signal peptide of i-cyt c1(INE)/cyt b2 was indeed cleaved in a Som1p-independent manner (lanes 2 and 4). These results support our argument that cargo sequences play a critical role in determining whether an Imp1p substrate needs Som1p to be cleaved.Fig. 6Signal sequence of p-cyt c1(INE)/cyt b2 is cleaved by Imp1p in a Som1p-independent manner. HA-tagged p-cyt c1 (INE)/cyt b2 was expressed in strains BY4741, JNY34/pXC3, XCY101, and HFY501 (lanes 1–4, respectively). Cells were subjected to a 10-min pulse. Proteins were precipitated using anti-HA antibodies and resolved by a SDS-7% gel. The band labeled i-cyt c1 (INE)/cyt b2 actually consists of two closely spaced bands. The upperband corresponds to p-cyt c1(INE)/cyt b2 with a bipartite presequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONSom1p is one of three known subunits, the others being Imp1p and Imp2p, of the yeast IMP. Imp1p and Imp2p are catalytic subunits with nonoverlapping substrate specificity (4Nunnari J. Fox T.D. Walter P. Science. 1993; 262: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and both subunits are members of the type I signal peptidase family (6Paetzel M. Karla A. Strynadka N.C. Dalbey R.E. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4549-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Although the function of Som1p remains largely unknown, previous studies (5Jan P.-S. Esser K. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Esser K. Jan P.S. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 271: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Esser K. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 437-445PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that Som1p is required to cleave two of the four known Imp1p substrates. Here, we have tested a model in which Som1p acts as a molecular chaperone that binds to the signal peptide or attached cargo of an Imp1p substrate and directs the substrate to Imp1p. We have tested this model by constructing and examining two chimeras. One chimera has the signal peptide of a Som1p-independent substrate fused to the cargo of a Som1p-dependent substrate (Fig. 1). The second chimera has a configuration similar to the first except its signal peptide and cargo come from substrates that display the opposite requirements for Som1p (Fig. 6). When these chimeras are tested for Som1p-dependent cleavage, results are consistent with the idea that cargo sequences play the critical role.To identify cargo sequences that putatively bind to Som1p, we have examined a series of internal and C-terminal deletions in chimeric and natural Imp1p substrates (Figs. 2, 3, 4). To our surprise, the mutated proteins are cleaved in a Som1p-dependent manner, with one exception (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). The exception occurs when a deletion removes cargo residues located next to the Imp1p cleavage site. This mutation inhibits Imp1p cleavage in the presence or absence of Som1p. However, deletion of cargo residues from a related protein does not prevent Som1p-dependent cleavage (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). We therefore suggest that this deletion alters the conformation of the cleavage site, rendering it inaccessible to Imp1p. The possibility remains, however, that Som1p binds to sequences from disparate regions of the folded or partially folded protein cargo, and Som1p binding can still occur when the binding site is partially removed from the cargo. We do not favor this idea based on our analysis of a novel Imp1p substrate generated for this study. This novel substrate has been produced by changing the cleavage site residues of an Imp2p substrate so that the substrate can be cleaved by Imp1p. The substrate p-cyt c1 is normally cleaved by Imp2p in a Som1p-independent manner, but when the substrate is switched to Imp1p, the substrate shows Som1p dependence (Fig. 5). We consider it unlikely that p-cyt c1 would have a Som1p-binding site used only when it is artificially switched from Imp2p to Imp1p. For these reasons, we suggest that Som1p does not bind to Imp1p substrates and thus is not a molecular chaperone.In a previous study, it has been shown that Som1p binds to Imp1p (5Jan P.-S. Esser K. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This binding is required for stabilization of Som1p but not Imp1p in yeast cells. Because of this close association between Som1p and Imp1p, we suggest that Som1p binding"
