https://openalex.org/W2040932962,"DURING photosynthetic studies in this laboratory, the desire for an organism possessing a simple internal structure prompted us to investigate the blue-green algae. It has occasionally been reported that these organisms contain grana or chloroplasts; but the most widely accepted opinion is that all their pigments are uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm1."

https://openalex.org/W2007060025,"THE increased transport of water through the skin of the frog under the action of posthypophysis extracts1 has been explained as due to decreased resistance to the water movement2. According to this view, an increased absolute diffusion of water in both directions would be expected."

In addition to confirming the fact of fixation, I have investigated the effect of a number of factors involved and the compounds in which the absorbed carbon appears, using carbon-14."

https://openalex.org/W2075051351,"THERE is no simple, satisfactory method for determining small amounts (<10−3M) of carboxylic soaps in aqueous solution. On the other hand, there are several methods of estimating synthetic ionic detergents, such as long-chain alkyl sulphates and quaternary ammonium salts. Of particular interest is the method of Epton1, in which the titration of anionic against cationic detergent is carried out using a partition end-point with methylene blue as indicator. We have now found that sodium oleate can be estimated by a modification of this method, if certain precautions are taken. Considerations of solubility led us to choose sodium oleate to illustrate the method, although it is clearly applicable to other soaps of similar constitution."

https://openalex.org/W2061137209,"DUE in part to the difficulty of preparing a specific group N precipitating serum for Streptococcus cremoris, the boundaries and constituents of serological group N have been so far incompletely determined. Although, by means of serological methods using interfacial precipitin tests with hydrochloric acid extracts, Str. cremoris has been grouped with Streptococcus lactis by Shattock and Mattick1, and with Str. lactis and with Streptococcus diacetilactis by Swartling2, final confirmation of its serological identity with group N must depend on the preparation of a specific group serum for Str. cremoris itself."

https://openalex.org/W2052589793,NONE of the theories of blood coagulation can explain some important anomalies without the introduction of hypothetical factors which have yet to be isolated. Their disadvantages are most apparent when an attempt is made to correlate: (a) the one- and two-stage method of prothrombin estimation; (b) the difference between the use of Russell viper venom plus lecithin and brain thromboplastin in the one-stage prothrombin estimation; (c) the apparent increase in prothrombin concentration in hæmophilic blood after clotting; (d) an apparent auto-catalytic generation of thrombin after clotting has commenced.

https://openalex.org/W2049696368,"VARIOUS methods for spreading proteins have been devised. The method used by Gorter and Grendel1 is to drop a fairly concentrated aqueous protein solution very carefully from the least possible height on to the clean water surface in the trough. Hughes et al.2 found that solid particles of protein spread very rapidly on a clean substrate surface. These methods proved to be unsuccessful for the spreading of arachin. Arachin was also not soluble in the aqueous propyl alcohol–sodium acetate mixture recommended by Ställberg and Teorell3. Very satisfactory monolayers of egg albumin and β-lacto-globulin were obtained by Bull4 by using 35 per cent ammonium sulphate as the underlying solution. Accordingly, arachin was next spread on strong ammonium sulphate solutions, and films stable up to high film pressures were obtained. The ammonium sulphate was of analytical quality and the solutions were treated with activated carbon black to remove all surface-active impurities."

Thus the multiplication and spread of the phage particles throughout the volume of the plaque must take place within the period set by the ageing of the bacterial colonies.
