The following summary briefly lists the most recent discoveries in the mouse, where genetic findings have played a relatively greater role than in the other species of mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2040844817,"By using spreading depression to decorticate temporarily one hemisphere in rats, a learning trace was established in the opposite functional hemisphere. Spontaneous transfer of the engram from the trained hemisphere to the untrained hemisphere does not occur when both hemispheres are functional. If, however, the animal was allowed to make one reinforced response, complete transfer of the engram to the untrained hemisphere occurred."

https://openalex.org/W2070021761,"WE have reported previously that Candida utilis removes seven purines (adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, uric acid, 2,6-diaminopurine and isoguanine) from the medium by an active transport process when these compounds are used as sources of nitrogen for the yeast1,2. These compounds and their metabolic products are held within the cell in high concentrations that appear to exceed the solubilities of the compounds in the volume of water available. For example, 5 gm. (wet weight) of yeast that had taken up 450 mgm. of uric acid was dried to constant weight, samples of the dried yeast were heated repeatedly in buffer at 100° C. to extract the uric acid, and the extracts were analysed with purified uricase by the method of Kalckar3. It was found that the dried yeast contained 16 per cent uric acid by weight and that 35 per cent of the uric acid administered was recovered in the extracts. It is presumed that the remaining 65 per cent of the uric acid had been metabolized via the yeast uricase. The wet yeast contained 82 per cent water, so that the concentration of uric acid would be about 35 mgm./ml. of water in the wet yeast. The solubility of uric acid is given as 2.53 mgm./100 ml. at 20° C. (ref. 4) and therefore the presence of crystalline uric acid in the yeast cell would be expected with the high concentrations that were observed."

When intestinal damage is minimized by appropriate timing and dosage, many mitotic inhibitors increase radioresistance and enhance the protective effects of mercaptoethylamine."

https://openalex.org/W2034604858,Strips of rat nerve from dorsal roots were immersed in solutions containing sodium cyanide and alpha-dinitrophenol. The inhibitors extinguish the action potential of such strips within minutes. The rapid action on mammalian nerve is contrasted with the slow effect of inhibitors on amphibian and invertebrate nerve.

This indicates that in the rat the depression of respiration is greater in flavoprotein or preflavoprotein systems than in the cytochromes, while in the toad and bird the augmentation of respiration by cytochrome system is 1.2–1.3 times greater than in the flavoprotein or preflavoprotein systems1. An attempt has been made in the present work to locate the nature of the evolution of oxidative enzymes in the preflavoprotein systems and also to indicate the nature of changes in oxygen consumption with amino-acid substrates and transamination in these systems."
