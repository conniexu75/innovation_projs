This spreading results from the tensile stresses generated by different spreading directions of two adjacent segments of the East Pacific Rise, and it is suggested that the area be called the Galapagos Rift Zone."

https://openalex.org/W2136172712,"Goethite, known to be antiferromagnetic, acquires thermoremanent magnetization at its Neel temperature of 120 degrees C. This remanence, extremely stable, is due to the presence of unbalanced spins in the antiferromagnetic structure; the spins may result from grain size, imperfections, or impurities."

https://openalex.org/W2009151778,The theory of radiation moving at superlight velocities is explained and fundamental equations which describe the general characteristics of the radiation are given. The energy losses of a charged particle moving in a plasma in the absence of external magnetic fields are discussed. The absorption of plasma waves in the plasma itself is shown to be conditioned by a reverse Cherenkov effect. The methods of heating plasma by an external beam of fast charged particles and by magneto-acoustic waves are described. (C.J.G.)

A square-based variant of the Ayampit√≠n point is distinctive of the earliest occupation, but the incidence and distribution of other types indicate that seasonal use persisted into agricultural and ceramic periods."

https://openalex.org/W2021698219,"Travel-time residuals of seismic P-waves were expanded in spherical harmonics to determine their global variations. The expansion cofficients were correlated with similar coefficients of geopotential, variations in heat flow, and the surface topography of Earth. Although none of the correlation coefficients is very high, best values are between the seismic delay times and variations in gravitational potential and between heat flow and surface topography."
