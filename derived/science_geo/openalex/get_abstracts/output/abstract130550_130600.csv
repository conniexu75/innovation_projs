https://openalex.org/W2139855058,"Gene expression was visualized in single living mammalian cells with β-lactamase as a reporter that hydrolyzes a substrate loaded intracellularly as a membrane-permeant ester. Each enzyme molecule changed the fluorescence of many substrate molecules from green to blue by disrupting resonance energy transfer. This wavelength shift was detectable by eye or color film in individual cells containing less than 100 β-lactamase molecules. The robust change in emission ratio reveals quantitative heterogeneity in real-time gene expression, enables clonal selection by flow cytometry, and forms a basis for high-throughput screening of pharmaceutical candidate drugs in living mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2093712250,"The preferred antitubercular drug isoniazid specifically targets a long-chain enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA), an enzyme essential for mycolic acid biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Despite the widespread use of this drug for more than 40 years, its precise mode of action has remained obscure. Data from x-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry reveal that the mechanism of isoniazid action against InhA is covalent attachment of the activated form of the drug to the nicotinamide ring of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide bound within the active site of InhA."
https://openalex.org/W2169979652,"The concentrations of the hydrogen radicals OH and HO2 in the middle and upper troposphere were measured simultaneously with those of NO, O3, CO, H2O, CH4, non-methane hydrocarbons, and with the ultraviolet and visible radiation field. The data allow a direct examination of the processes that produce O3 in this region of the atmosphere. Comparison of the measured concentrations of OH and HO2 with calculations based on their production from water vapor, ozone, and methane demonstrate that these sources are insufficient to explain the observed radical concentrations in the upper troposphere. The photolysis of carbonyl and peroxide compounds transported to this region from the lower troposphere may provide the source of HOx required to sustain the measured abundances of these radical species. The mechanism by which NO affects the production of O3 is also illustrated by the measurements. In the upper tropospheric air masses sampled, the production rate for ozone (determined from the measured concentrations of HO2 and NO) is calculated to be about 1 part per billion by volume each day. This production rate is faster than previously thought and implies that anthropogenic activities that add NO to the upper troposphere, such as biomass burning and aviation, will lead to production of more O3 than expected."
https://openalex.org/W2053315875,"Halogen atoms from the reactions of sea-salt particles may play a significant role in the marine boundary layer. Reactions of sodium chloride, the major component of sea-salt particles, with nitrogen oxides generate chlorine atom precursors. However, recent studies suggest there is an additional source of chlorine in the marine troposphere. This study shows that molecular chlorine is generated from the photolysis of ozone in the presence of sea-salt particles above their deliquescence point; this process may also occur in the ocean surface layer. Given the global distribution of ozone, this process may provide a global source of chlorine."
https://openalex.org/W2089471108,"A new member of the uncoupling protein (UCP) family called UCP3 has recently been cloned and shown to be highly expressed in skeletal muscle of rodents and humans. In the present study, UCP3 was overexpressed in C2C12myoblasts where it acts as an uncoupling protein. Changes in UCP3 mRNA expression were examined in rodent muscles under conditions known to modulate thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. In skeletal muscle, UCP3 expression did not change in response to 48 h of cold exposure (6 °C), whereas it was decreased by 81% or increased 5.6-fold by 1 week of 50% food restriction or fasting, respectively. It was also decreased by 36% in soleus muscle of obese (fa/fa) as compared with lean Zucker rats. The unexpected rise of UCP3 mRNA level induced by fasting did not change in vitro muscle basal heat production rate but decreased by 31% the capacity to produce heat in response to the uncoupler carbonylcyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. This decrease may reflect underlying uncoupling by UCP3. Up-regulation of UCP3 mRNA after a 24-h fast was still observed in mice exposed at thermoneutrality. These results show that the increase in UCP3 expression induced by fasting is associated with the maintenance of thermogenesis measured in muscle in vitro and is not modulated by environmental temperature. The notion that UCP3 expression is modulated by food intake is of importance to better understand the pathophysiology of obesity in humans.

The uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) 1The abbreviations used are: UCP, uncoupling protein; BAT, brown adipose tissue; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; FCCP, carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. 1The abbreviations used are: UCP, uncoupling protein; BAT, brown adipose tissue; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; FCCP, carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. gene encodes a mitochondrial protein carrier that stimulates heat production by uncoupling respiration from ATP synthesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and plays an important role in nonshivering and diet-induced thermogenesis in rodents (1Himms-Hagen J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2890-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Recently, new proteins sharing 55 and 56% amino acid identities with UCP1 have been identified and called UCP2 and UCP3 (2Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C.

Commun. 1997; 235: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The tissue distributions of UCP2 and UCP3 were very different from that of UCP1, which is BAT-specific, being either ubiquitous (UCP2) or specific to skeletal muscle and BAT (UCP3) (2Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nat.

Commun. 1997; 235: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). UCP2 was shown to be an uncoupling protein because in transfected yeast it partially uncouples mitochondrial respiration (2Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). The modulations of UCP2 expression have also been studied in various tissues of the rat. Cold exposure was found to affect UCP2 similarly to UCP1 in BAT (5Boss O. Samec S. Dulloo A. Seydoux J. Muzzin P. Giacobino J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Fasting, however, was found to up-regulate UCP2 mRNA in the skeletal muscle (5Boss O. Samec S. Dulloo A. Seydoux J. Muzzin P. Giacobino J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The presence of UCP3 in skeletal muscle is of great interest because this tissue is an important site of catecholamine and diet-induced thermogenesis in rats (6Thurlby P.L. Ellis R.D.M. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1986; 64: 1111-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and in humans (7Astrup A. Bulow J. Christensen N.J. Madsen J. Quaade F. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: E226-E229PubMed Google Scholar, 8Simonsen L. Stallknecht B. Bulow J. Int. J. Obes. 1993; 17: 47-51Google Scholar). UCP3 might therefore play a major role in whole body thermogenesis. The aims of this work were: (i) to develop a cell line of UCP3-transfected myoblasts and to examine the effects of UCP3 expression on mitochondrial membrane potential and (ii) to studyin vivo modulations of UCP3 expression in BAT and in skeletal muscle under conditions known to affect UCP1 and UCP2. The results obtained show that UCP3 has an uncoupling activity in transfected myoblasts. They also demonstrate that UCP3 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle is modulated by food intake but not by changes in environmental temperature. A 0.9-kilobase pair fragment containing the coding sequence of the human UCP3 was excised from pBluescript atEcoRI and HindIII sites (present in the multiple cloning site of the vector) and inserted into theEcoRI/HindIII sites of the expression vector, pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen, Leek, Netherlands). C2C12 myoblast cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected with either the empty pcDNA 3.1 or the vector containing the human UCP3 using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Stable transfectants were obtained by growth of the cells in culture medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Colonies derived from single cells were isolated and expanded. Cell lines were screened for the expression of UCP3 by Northern blot analysis. Stable transfected C2C12 myoblast cells were grown on 25-mm round glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 nmtetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) in a balanced salt solution containing 5.5 mm glucose, 120 mmNaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mmKH2PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES buffer adjusted to pH 7.4. Confocal images were acquired with an invert laser scan microscope (LSM 410 invert, Carl Zeiss, Germany). The cells were excited with a HeNe 543 nm laser and observed at emission above 590 nm. All images were acquired with the same parameters and analyzed with LSM-PC software (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Subconfluent C2C12 myoblast cells were loaded with TMRE (10 nm) in the presence or the absence of the uncoupler carbonylcyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (75 μm). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed, trypsinized, and resuspended in the balanced salt solution with TMRE (10 nm). Flow cytometry was performed with a FACStarPlus cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA) using the 514 nm line of an argon laser to assess the mitochondrial membrane potential. Fluorescent light was directed to a photomultiplier tube equipped with a filter selecting above 590 nm. A minimum of 10,000 cells/sample were acquired and analyzed with Lysis II software. 7-week old Sprague-Dawley male rats or 9-week old female lean (Fa/?) and obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats fed ad libitum standard laboratory chow were maintained under a 12-h light-dark cycle at 23 °C. All animals were caged individually during the experimental periods. Rats were either exposed to cold (6 °C) or fasted with free access to water for 48 h. Studies were also performed with adult C57BL male mice, which were fed the same diet as the rats. They were divided into three groups: group 1 was kept at 23 °C for 1 week, group 2 was kept at thermoneutrality (33 °C) for 1 week, and group 3 was kept at 23 °C and pair-fed with the mice at 33 °C for 1 week. 24 h before sacrifice, half of the mice in each group were fasted with free access to water containing 4.5 g/liter of NaCl. The animals were killed by decapitation, and soleus and tibialis anterior muscles, as well as interscapular BAT carefully trimmed from white adipose tissue, connective tissue, and muscle, were excised, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was purified by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (9Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar), and 12–20 μg were electrophoresed in a 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, as described by Lehrachet al. (10Lehrach H. Diamond D. Wozney J.M. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar) and transferred to Electran Nylon Blotting membranes (BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole, UK) by vacuum blotting. The probes used were a full-length rat UCP3 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number U92069). The UCP3 signal in rat and mouse was a doublet with sizes of 2.5 and 2.8 kilobases as already described (3Boss O. Samec S. Paoloni-Giacobino A. Rossier C. Dulloo A. Seydoux J. Muzzin P. Giacobino J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). The probe was labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham) to a specific radioactivity of approximately 1 × 109dpm/μg DNA. Northern blots were hybridized for 2 h at 65 °C in QuikHyb solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and then washed in a solution of 2 × SSC (1 × SSC is 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0)/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50 °C twice for 5 min and in 0.1×SSC/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50 °C for 5 min. Blots were exposed to Hyperfilm ECL films (Amersham) at −80 °C with intensifying screens. Size estimates for the RNA species were established by comparison with an RNA Ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.). The signals on the autoradiograms were quantified by scanning photodensitometry using ImageQuant Software version 3.3 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Hybridization of the blots with a [γ-32P]ATP-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide specific for the 18 S rRNA subunit was used to correct for differences in the amounts of RNA loaded onto the gel. Student's unpaired ttest was used to determine statistical significance. Soleus muscle obtained from adult mice kept at 23 °C either fed ad libitum or fasted for 24 h were mounted on a rigid frame made of thin stainless steel thread and introduced in the test chamber of a twin microcalorimeter (Secfroid, S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland) as described previously (11Chinet A. Clausen T. Girardier L. J. Physiol. 1977; 265: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Both test and reference chambers were perifused with the same standard, Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate-buffered solution containing 5 mmglucose that was gassed continuously with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at pH 7.4 and 30 °C. The perifused intact muscle is a convenient tissue preparation to measure its heat production rate provided that muscle size, specific metabolic rate, and O2 availability have been adequately chosen to prevent an anoxic core. Because intact muscles of adult rats, such as the soleus, are too thick to avoid an anoxic core, soleus muscles from adult mice have been used. C2C12 cells, which expressed low amounts of UCP2 mRNA at the myoblast stage of differentiation and no UCP3 mRNA, were transfected with either an empty vector (control) or a vector containing the human UCP3 cDNA. A cell clone was chosen in which the level of expression of UCP3 mRNA, as measured by Northern blot analysis, was as high as in human skeletal muscle. Control and transfected cells were incubated with TMRE, a fluorescent dye that is sensitive to the mitochondrial potential,i.e. to the electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Confocal microscopy studies confirmed that the fluorescence is specifically localized in mitochondria as already described (12Farkas D.L. de Wei M. Febbroriello P. Carson J.H. Loew L.M Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 1053-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). As expected, the specific mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP (75 μm) strongly decreased the fluorescence (Fig. 1). To evaluate the effect of UCP3 on mitochondrial membrane potential, fluorescence intensities were measured using flow cytometry in UCP3-transfected and control C2C12 cells. As shown in Fig.2, UCP3 transfection resulted in a shift of the fluorescence peak to the left, which reflected a decrease in the level of fluorescence per cell. The mean values of 24.2 ± 0.7 (n = 3) and 18.8 ± 0.7 (n = 5) fluorescence arbitrary units in control and UCP3-transfected cells, respectively, differed significantly from each other (p< 0.0025). Addition of CCCP induced a large shift to the left in both populations of cells (p < 0.001). In fully uncoupled cells, the fluorescence peaks of control and UCP3 transfected cells were superimposed. The effect of CCCP was therefore weaker in the transfected cells than in control cells (p < 0.001), confirming the lower basal mitochondrial membrane potential in the former.Figure 2Human UCP3 expressed in C2C12 myoblasts decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential. Cells transfected with the empty vector (Cont.) or with the human UCP3 cDNA (UCP3) were incubated with the mitochondrial potential-sensitive dye TMRE and analyzed by flow cytometry. The chemical uncoupler CCCP (75 μm) was used as a positive control. One experiment representative of three to five is shown, with a minimum of 10,000 events/sample.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Conditions known to modulate UCP1 expression were chosen to examine the possible changes of UCP3 mRNA expression in vivo, i.e. cold exposure and fasting. Cold exposure was found to increase UCP3 expression 1.5-fold in rat BAT (p < 0.05,n = 5; results not shown). As seen in Fig.3 A, it had no effect on UCP3 expression in rat tibialis anterior muscle. A 48-h fast was found to decrease UCP3 expression by 74% in rat BAT (p < 0.005, n = 5; results not shown); however, as seen in Fig. 3 A, it increased UCP3 expression 5.6-fold in rat tibialis anterior muscle. To determine whether the up-regulation of UCP3 mRNA induced by fasting in the skeletal muscle was reflected by changes in muscle heat production, direct microcalorimetric studies were performed using mouse soleus muscle. It was found that 24 h of fasting increased UCP3 expression by 3.5-fold (p < 0.001; results not shown) in mouse soleus. Fig. 4 shows that basal heat production was unchanged after a 24-h fast in mouse soleus. The effects of the uncoupler carbonylcyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) were then tested on the soleus muscle of mice fed ad libitum or fasted for 24 h. FCCP markedly increased heat production rate in fed or fasted soleus muscles. The mean stimulated heat production rate was smaller by 31% (p < 0.001) in fasted as compared with fed mouse soleus muscle. Because BAT thermogenesis is decreased during fasting, the increase in muscle UCP3 expression could occur to prevent a too large decrease in body temperature. To test this hypothesis, experiments were performed to investigate the effects of a 24-h fast on UCP3 mRNA expression in tibialis anterior muscle of mice kept at thermoneutrality (33 °C). As shown in Fig. 3 B, in muscle of these mice UCP3 expression was decreased by 76%. Because mice at 33 °C fedad libitum ate less (by about 50%) than those at 23 °C, a group of mice maintained at 23 °C and pair-fed with the mice at 33 °C was run in parallel. It can be seen (Fig. 3 B) that pair feeding decreased UCP3 expression in tibialis anterior muscle by 81% and that thermoneutrality by itself had no effect per se on UCP3 expression. The stimulatory effects of 24 h of fasting were similar in mice kept at 23 °C or 33 °C (4.6- and 5.6-fold, respectively) and were higher (8.1-fold) in the pair-fed mice. A model of genetically obese Zucker fa/fa rats in which there is a decrease in thermogenesis (1Himms-Hagen J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2890-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) has been studied. In these rats, UCP3 mRNA expression was shown to be decreased in obesefa/fa to 58 ± 5 (p < 0.01) or 59 ± 2% (p < 0.05) of that of the lean Fa/? control values in BAT and soleus muscle, respectively. Previously reported UCP1 and UCP2 transfection studies have been performed in yeast (2Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S.

Tartaglia L.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 900-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Because UCP3 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle (4Vidal-Puig A. Solanes G. Grujic D. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), the putative uncoupling activity of UCP3 was investigated using a mouse myoblast cell line, C2C12. The results obtained by overexpression of UCP3 confirmed what has been inferred from sequence analysis (3Boss O. Samec S. Paoloni-Giacobino A. Rossier C. Dulloo A. Seydoux J. Muzzin P. Giacobino J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar),i.e. that UCP3 has uncoupling properties. Using the mitochondrial membrane potential fluorescent dye TMRE and flow cytometry, we showed that transfection of C2C12cells with UCP3 dissipated part of the mitochondrial proton motive force. The uncoupling activity of UCP3 has recently been shown in transformed yeast (14Gong D.-W. He Y. Karas M. Reitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24129-24132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Our results also indicated that the degree of mitochondrial uncoupling was small as compared with the total uncoupling effect induced by CCCP. This relatively small degree of uncoupling is comparable with that previously reported for UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 in transformed yeast (2Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar, 13Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Weng X. Deng N.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24129-24132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that the uncoupling activity is tightly controlled inside the cell. Inhibition of UCP3 activity in vivo could be mediated by GDP because a potential purine nucleotide binding site is present in the protein (3Boss O. Samec S. Paoloni-Giacobino A. Rossier C. Dulloo A. Seydoux J. Muzzin P. Giacobino J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar), by other nucleotides, or by as yet unidentified factors. Under the metabolic conditions studied, i.e. cold exposure or fasting, the level of UCP3 mRNA in BAT was modulated in the same way as that of UCP1 (results not shown). Indeed, in this tissue, it has been reported that cold exposure increases (1Himms-Hagen J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2890-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 6Thurlby P.L. Ellis R.D.M. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1986; 64: 1111-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and fasting decreases (5Boss O. Samec S. Dulloo A. Seydoux J. Muzzin P. Giacobino J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 15Trayhurn P. Jennings G. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: R11-R16PubMed Google Scholar) UCP1 expression. The striking parallelism found between UCP1 and UCP3 modulations in BAT is consistent with a role of UCP3 as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation in this thermogenic tissue. The results obtained in skeletal muscle indicate that UCP3 mRNA level was not modified by cold exposure and that the decreased UCP3 expression measured at 33 °C can be attributed to the decrease in food intake occurring at thermoneutrality (Fig. 3 B). This marked decrease in UCP3 expression might contribute to the lower whole body energy dissipation induced by food restriction (16Rothwell N.J. Stock M.J. Biosci. Rep. 1982; 2: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The results obtained in BAT and muscles of Zucker rats are also in line with a role of UCP3 as a thermogenic protein. The decrease in UCP3 observed in obese (fa/fa) rats might contribute to their decreased thermogenesis (1Himms-Hagen J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2890-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Fasting induces a paradoxical effect on UCP3 expression in muscle that is opposite to that induced by food restriction, i.e. a marked increase (Fig. 3 A). Despite this increase in UCP3, fasting had no effect on in vitro soleus muscle basal heat production rate (Fig. 4). Because thermogenesis due to anabolic-catabolic pathways is probably reduced in fasted animals, the maintenance of a normal heat production rate might result from a compensatory effect by UCP3. The hypothesis of a more uncoupled state in fasted soleus muscle is supported by the observation that the mean stimulation of heat production induced by FCCP was significantly lower in fasted than in control mouse soleus muscle. In mice kept at thermoneutrality, the increase in tibialis anterior muscle UCP3 expression induced by fasting was similar to that of control mice kept at 23 °C (Fig. 3 B). This result does not support the notion that changes in muscle UCP3 level might play a role in the maintenance of body temperature. These results indicate that the increase in UCP3 expression induced by fasting is associated with the maintenance of thermogenesis measured in muscle in vitro and is not modified by changes in the environmental temperature. They also show that different mechanisms are responsible for the control of UCP3 expression in BAT and in skeletal muscle. In BAT, the effects of cold exposure or fasting on UCP3 expression, like those on UCP1, should be mediated by an increase or a decrease, respectively, of the sympathetic nervous system activity. In muscle UCP3 expression seems not to be controlled by the same system but probably by changes in food intake among other factors. Among the metabolic changes induced by fasting, the increase in the circulating fatty acids (17Ohno T. Yahata T. Kuroshima A. J. Physiol. 1990; 40: 463-470Google Scholar, 18Guezennec C.Y. Nonglaton J. Serrurier B. Merino D. Defer G. Eur. J. Appl. Physiol. 1988; 57: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) or the increase in plasma glucocorticoids (17Ohno T. Yahata T.

Further experiments are underway in our laboratory to elucidate this mechanism. UCP3, being highly expressed in human skeletal muscle (3Boss O. Samec S. Paoloni-Giacobino A. Rossier C. Dulloo A.

It is conceivable that disregulations of UCP3 activity or expression could favor body weight gain and obesity. The notion that UCP3 expression is dependent on food intake is of importance to better understand the biochemical events relating energy intake to energy expenditure.

https://openalex.org/W2112535900,"Bacteria able to grow in aqueous:organic two-phase systems have evolved resistance mechanisms to the toxic effects of solvents. One such mechanism is the active efflux of solvents from the cell, preserving the integrity of the cell interior.Pseudomonas putida S12 is resistant to a wide variety of normally detrimental solvents due to the action of such an efflux pump. The genes for this solvent efflux pump were cloned from P. putida S12 and their nucleotide sequence determined. The deduced amino acid sequences encoded by the three genes involved show a striking resemblance to proteins known to be involved in proton-dependent multidrug efflux systems. Transfer of the genes for the solvent efflux pump to solvent-sensitive P. putida strains results in the acquisition of solvent resistance.

This opens up the possibilities of using the solvent efflux system to construct bacterial strains capable of performing biocatalytic transformations of insoluble substrates in two-phase aqueous:organic medium. The microbial transformation of hydrocarbons is important not only in environmental applications such as soil remediation and waste stream purification, but also in biocatalytic applications for the production of specialty chemicals. The metabolic pathways by which many of these compounds are degraded in various bacteria have been elucidated and in many cases the genes coding for the enzymes involved have been cloned and sequenced (1Zylstra G.J. Garte S.J. Molecular Environmental Biology. Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, FL1995: 83-115Google Scholar). A major problem in applying hydrocarbon degrading bacteria to industrial processes is their susceptibility to the toxic effects of the very substrate that the organism is utilizing as a carbon source. This is often due to accumulation of the hydrophobic compound in bacterial membranes which can cause devastating effects on membrane structure (2Sikkema J. de Bont J.A.M. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8022-8028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sikkema J. de Bont J.A.M. Poolman B. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 201-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second problem in the application of catabolic pathways in the synthesis of fine chemicals is that many of the desired substrates of enzymatic reactions are sparingly soluble in water and thus may not be fully bioavailable to microorganisms. The use of solvent tolerant bacteria allows the introduction of a nonpolar phase to the medium, dissolving the desired substrate, and increasing the exposure of the cell to the substrate. Many different mechanisms have been described that contribute to solvent resistance (Fig. 1) but despite these efforts no comprehensive overview is available to explain the physiological response of microorganisms to toxic organic solvents (for a recent review, see Weber and de Bont (4Weber F.J. de Bont J.A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 225-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar)). Our laboratories have been investigating the ability of Pseudomonas putida S12 to withstand toxic concentrations of toluene and other organic solvents (5Weber F.J. Ooijkaas L.P. Schemen R.M. Hartmans S. de Bont J.A.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3502-3504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This organism has evolved at least two mechanisms to combat the accumulation of hydrophobic solvents in the membrane or the interior of the cell. One key observation was the detection of trans- rather than cis-unsaturated fatty acids in the membrane of the solvent-tolerant bacterium upon exposure to solvents (6Heipieper H.J. de Bont J.A.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 4440-4444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Heipieper H.J. Weber F.J. Sikkema J. Keweloh H. de Bont J.A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 409-415Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The conversion of cis- to trans-unsaturated fatty acids by a direct isomerization alters the packing of the phospholipids in the bacterial membrane. This results in a change in membrane fluidity, making the membrane less likely to allow solvents to partition into it, decreasing the detrimental effects on the membrane due to solvent partitioning, and thus increasing the solvent resistance of the cell (8Keweloh H. Heipieper H.J. Lipids. 1996; 31: 129-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that a second mechanism of solvent resistance is possessed by P. putida S12. This is an energy-dependent active efflux system for solvents such as toluene (9Isken S. de Bont J.A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6056-6058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that may function in a fashion similar to that for multidrug efflux pumps found in many antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Thus, P. putida S12 employs at least two mechanisms for active defense against the detrimental effects of solvents: one functioning to keep solvents out of the interior of the cell and a second functioning to prevent solvents from partitioning into the cell membrane. In the present report we describe the construction of transposon mutants of P. putida S12 that have lost the solvent tolerant phenotype. This allowed the cloning of the genes responsible for a solvent efflux pump that is involved in the ability of P. putida S12 to withstand toxic concentrations of organic solvents. The nucleotide sequence of the genes involved was determined and their relationship to other bacterial efflux systems is discussed. P. putida S12 (10Hartmans S. van der Werf M.J. de Bont J.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is the wild-type strain capable of growth at supersaturated solvent concentrations (5Weber F.J. Ooijkaas L.P. Schemen R.M. Hartmans S. de Bont J.A.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3502-3504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is the object of the present investigation. P. putida JK1 is a solvent-sensitive mutant of P. putida S12 derived in the present work by transposon mutagenesis with TnMod-KmO. P. putida JJD1, also derived in the present work, contains a kanamycin gene/ColE1 origin cassette insertion in the genome ofP. putida S12. The solvent-sensitive strain P. putida PPO200 is P. putida mt-2 cured of the TOL plasmid (11Zylstra G.J. Olsen R.H. Ballou D.P. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5907-5914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The artificial transposable element TnMod-KmO 1J. J. Dennis and G. J. Zylstra, manuscript in preparation. contains a kanamycin resistance gene and the ColE1 origin of replication between Tn5 inverted repeats. The Tn5transposase gene and an origin of transfer for conjugation are present outside the inverted repeats.

Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar), the pGEM series of cloning vectors (Promega, Madison, WI), and the broad host range vector pUCP22 (13West S.E. Schweizer H.P. Dall C. Sample A.K. Runyen-Janecky L.J. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 148: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) were used for the construction of subclones. L broth (14Lennox E.S. Virology. 1955; 1: 190-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar) was used as complete medium. Minimal medium was prepared as described by Stanier et al. (15Stanier R.Y. Palleroni N.J. Doudoroff M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1966; 43: 159-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). Solid media contained 2% agar. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), or gentamicin (25 μg/ml) were added to the medium to maintain recombinant plasmids in E. coli. Gentamycin (25 μg/ml) was used to maintain the pUCP22 subclones in P. putida and kanamycin (250 μg/ml) was used in the selection of P. putida S12 transposon mutants. E. coli strains were routinely cultured at 37 °C and P. putida strains were grown at 30 °C. Growth of bacterial strains in the presence of various solvents (indicating solvent resistance) was determined essentially as described by Weber et al. (5Weber F.J. Ooijkaas L.P. Schemen R.M. Hartmans S. de Bont J.A.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3502-3504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments were conducted twice with duplicate samples each time. The conjugatable suicide transposon donor TnMod-KmO was introduced into P. putida S12 by triparental mating using pRK2013 as the mobilizing plasmid by established procedures (16Ditta G. Stanfield S. Corbin D. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7347-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar, 17Kim E. Zylstra G.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3095-3103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kanamycin-resistant colonies were tested for the ability to grow on L agar plates in the presence of saturating vapor amounts of toluene. This was accomplished by placing the agar plates in a sealed glass dessicator along with a small beaker containing toluene. Growth was scored after 12 h at 30 °C. Total genomic DNA from P. putidastrains was prepared by the CTAB procedure (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1991Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated by the alkaline-sodium dodecyl sulfate lysis method of Birnboim and Doly (19Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9908) Google Scholar). DNA was digested with restriction enzymes and ligated with T4 ligase as recommended by the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). DNA restriction fragment and PCR 2The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair(s). products were visualized by 0.7% or 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis in 40 mmTris, 20 mm acetate, 2 mm EDTA buffer. DNA from agarose gels was isolated using the method of Vogelstein and Gillespie (20Vogelstein B. Gillespie D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was introduced into either E. coli JM109 or P. putida JK1 cells by electroporation (21Dennis J.J. Sokol P.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 47: 125-133PubMed Google Scholar) using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad Laboratories). All sequencing and PCR reactions were performed using a Gene Amp PCR System 9600 (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA). Nucleotide sequencing reactions were performed with purified double strand plasmid DNA or PCR products using AmpliTaq FS DNA polymerase fluorescent dye terminator reactions (Perkin-Elmer) as recommended by the supplier. Sequencing products were detected using an Applied Biosystems 373A stretch automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). Nucleotide sequence analysis was performed either with the Genetics Computer Group analysis package (22Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar) or with the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST server (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). PCR reactions for amplifying the region of genomic P. putida S12 DNA containing the insertion point for the transposon were performed usingTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The reaction mixture (100 μl) was treated for 1 min at 94 °C followed by 25 cycles of 1 min at 96 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C before finishing for 10 min at 72 °C. Primers for this reaction were 5′-CGTTTGCAACCGGTGAG-3′ and 5′-TATCGGACGCAAACG-3′ corresponding to positions 3735 to 3752 and 4238 to 4253 of the nucleotide sequence, respectively. P. putidaS12 was chosen for a molecular study of the basis of solvent resistance due to the extensive physiological studies that have been performed on the strain (4Weber F.J. de Bont J.A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 225-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 5Weber F.J. Ooijkaas L.P. Schemen R.M. Hartmans S. de Bont J.A.M. Appl. Environ.

The organism can grow in the presence of a wide variety of normally toxic solvents with log POWvalues ranging from 2.3 to 3.5 (Table I). Initially, several solvent-sensitive transposon mutants were constructed using TnMod-KmO. P. putida S12 mutants which are no longer resistant to solvents were detected by the inability of kanamycin-resistant exconjugants to grow on L medium in the presence of supersaturated vapor concentrations of toluene as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Several toluene-sensitive mutants were obtained and one of these, designated strain JK1, was chosen for further analysis. Besides toluene, JK1 is sensitive to a number of other solvents with log POW values less than or equal to 3.5 (Table I), indicating that a single genetic trait is responsible for resistance to all of the solvents tested.Table IGrowth of P. putida S12 on L/acetate in the presence of various solventsSolventLog PowGrowth on L/acetate and 1% solventP. putida S12P. putida JK1P. putida JK1 (pUCP22)P. putida JK1 (pJD105)P. putida JK1 (pJD106)Hexadecane8.8+++++Decane5.6+++++p-Cymene4.1+++++Propylbenzene3.6+++++Hexane3.5+−−++Cyclohexane3.2+−−++Ethylbenzene3.1+−−+−p-Xylene3.0+−−+−Octanol2.9+−−+−Toluene2.5+−−+−Dimethylphthalate2.3+−−+−Fluorobenzene2.2−−−−−Benzene2.0−−−−− Open table in a new tab To characterize the genes for solvent resistance in P. putidaS12 in more detail, the region of the genome containing the transposon insertion in mutant JK1 was cloned. This was aided by the fact that the TnMod-KmO transposable element utilized in the construction of the mutants contains an origin of replication derived from plasmid ColE1. Total genomic DNA from JK1 was cleaved withBamHI, ligated to form circular molecules, and electroporated into E. coli JM109 with selection for kanamycin resistance. Since BamHI does not cleave the transposon, the resulting clone, pJD101 (Fig.2), must contain DNA from both sides of the transposon insertion. Approximately 11 kilobases of genomic DNA was cloned along with the transposon which contains the origin of replication and the kanamycin resistance gene (2 kb). The point at which the transposon is inserted is only 1 kb away from one end of theBamHI fragment cloned from strain JK1. This being the case, a second, overlapping 4-kb PstI fragment was cloned from strain JK1 (designated pJD102, Fig. 2). The cloned genomic DNA was initially analyzed by determining the nucleotide sequence to either side of the transposon insertion point using primers specific for either end of the transposon. Screening for similar nucleotide sequences in the GenBank data base revealed a significant match with genes coding for multidrug resistance export pumps, consistent with the hypothesis that a solvent efflux pump is a key solvent resistance mechanism of P. putida S12. The complete nucleotide sequence of an operon into which the transposon had inserted was determined using a series of subclones and internal oligonucleotide primers. Both strands of a 6.5-kb SstI fragment were sequenced in their entirety. To accurately determine the nucleotide sequence at the transposon insertion point, a 0.5-kb DNA fragment was amplified by PCR from the genome of the wild-type strainP. putida S12 using oligonucleotide primers flanking the transposon insertion point in strain JK1. A cartoon of the nucleotide sequence obtained is shown in Fig. 2 to show the relationship of the open reading frames with the two clones pJD101 and pJD102 and the complete nucleotide sequence is shown in Fig.3. The three open reading frames show significant homology to the three proteins that assemble to form proton-dependent multidrug resistance efflux pumps (27Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5853-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar) and thus the genes were labeled srp for solventresistance pump.Figure 3Nucleotide sequence of an SstI fragment containing the srpABC genes. The deduced amino acid sequences of the encoded proteins are shown belowthe nucleotide sequence. Termination codons are indicated with anasterisk, putative ribosome-binding sites areunderlined, a putative RNA polymerase-binding site isunderlined, and the TnMod-KmO insertion point is marked with an arrow. The GenBank accession number for the srpABC sequence is AF029405.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To prove that the three open reading frames detected in the cloned fragment at the point of insertion of the TnMod-KmO transposon actually are responsible for solvent resistance, complementation experiments were performed. This required reconstruction of the operon since the clones obtained (pJD101 and pJD102) contain the transposon mutagenized DNA. ABglII-SstI kanamycin resistance cassette also containing the ColE1 origin of replication from TnMod-KmO was inserted at the BglII and SstI sites of a 6.7-kb ClaI fragment derived from pJD101. The resulting plasmid (pJD103, Fig. 2) was electroporated intoP. putida S12 to construct a new mutation by site-specific reciprocal recombination. The resulting strain, JJD1, contains a kanamycin resistance gene adjacent to the srpABC genes in the genome. A 12-kb EcoRI genomic fragment containing the kanamycin/ColE1 cassette was cloned from JJD1. This plasmid, designated pJD104 (Fig. 2), contains the intact srpABC genes. A 6.5-kbSstI fragment was cloned from pJD104 into the vector pUCP22 in both orientations with respect to the lac promoter. JK1 containing either of these two plasmids, designated pJD105 and pJD106 (Fig. 2), regained solvent resistance. JK1(pJD105), containing thesrpABC genes in the same orientation as the lacpromoter, regained resistance to all of the solvents that the original strain, P. putida S12, was resistant to (Table I). However, JK1(pJD106), containing the srpABC genes in the opposite orientation to the lac promoter, regained resistance to only two solvents, hexane and cyclohexane, with log POW values near the border of the resistance phenotype. These results are consistent with the solvent resistance phenotype being dependent on the level of expression of the srpABC genes. P. putida S12 displays multiple physiological responses to organic solvents (see Introduction). Intuitively, a solvent efflux pump would be the most important mechanism of solvent resistance since it would be involved in actively removing solvents from the cell. Experiments were therefore performed to determine whether the solvent efflux pump by itself is capable of imparting the solvent resistance phenotype on other P. putida strains. The two plasmids, pJD105 and pJD106, were electroporated into the normally solvent sensitiveP. putida PPO200. The resulting recombinant strains are able to grow on rich medium in a toluene-saturated atmosphere, whereas the parent strain PPO200 with the vector pUCP22 could not (Fig.4). PPO200(pJD106) grew slightly slower than PPO200(pJD105), probably due to the fact that thesrpABC genes are expressed from the lac promoter in pJD105. In liquid culture, PPO200(pUCP22) could withstand concentrations of toluene up to 2.8 mm while both PPO200(pJD105) and PPO200(pJD106) showed resistance to the toxic effects of toluene up to a concentration of 4.9 mm (TableII). Neither of the recombinant strains were resistant to a second phase of toluene (5.6 mm). These experiments indicate that the solvent resistance phenotype can be transferred to other bacterial strains and that the resistance can be enhanced by higher levels of gene expression.Table IIGrowth of P. putida PPO200 containing the cloned srp genes on L medium in the presence of tolueneToluene ConcentrationGrowth on L medium with tolueneP. putida PPO200 (pUCP22)P. putida PPO200 (pJD105)P. putdia PPO200 (pJD106)mm0.0+++0.7+++1.4+++2.1+++2.8+++3.5−++4.2−++4.9−++5.6−−− Open table in a new tab In the past several years solvent-resistant microorganisms have been isolated directly from the environment (5Weber F.J.

It is evident that these organisms must therefore have specific adaptation mechanisms that impart the solvent resistance. Physiological studies on microorganisms isolated from the environment that are naturally resistant to high levels of organic solvents have revealed that many different factors may play a role (4Weber F.J. de Bont J.A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 225-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 7Heipieper H.J. Weber F.J. Sikkema J. Keweloh H. de Bont J.A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 409-415Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Naturally solvent-resistant bacteria have been shown to alter the composition of the cell membrane by increasing the ratio of trans- tocis-unsaturated fatty acids (26Weber F.J. Isken S. de Bont J.A.M. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2013-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) or by changing the headgroup composition (37Ramos J.L. Duque E. Rodriguez-Herva J.J. Godoy P. Haidour A. Reyes F. Fernandez-Barrero A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3887-3890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This change in the cell membrane produces a physical barrier, preventing solvents from entering the cell by decreasing membrane fluidity. This would not entirely prevent solvents from entering the cell, only slow down their diffusion into the cell and increase the time needed to reach equilibrium with the external environment. An intuitively better method of solvent resistance would be to physically remove the solvent from the cell. One way of doing this would be to degrade the solvent but this would only be effective against low concentrations of solvents. Evidence was recently obtained that an energy-dependent export system for hydrophobic solvents functions to remove solvents from the interior of whole cells (9Isken S. de Bont J.A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6056-6058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This solvent efflux pump should be a key element in solvent resistance by naturally solvent-resistant bacteria. The genes for such a solvent efflux pump in P. putida S12 were identified via transposon mutagenesis to construct a solvent-sensitive strain. The genes were cloned and sequenced and their role in solvent resistance verified through complementation of the transposon mutation. The three genes involved were labeled srpABC for solventresistance pump. The deduced amino acid sequences of the proteins encoded by thesrpABC genes have extensive homology with those for proton-dependent multidrug efflux systems of the resistance/nodulation/cell division family (27Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5853-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). This “RND” family of efflux pumps is composed of three protein components that together span the inner and outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria: an inner membrane transporter (SrpB analogues), an outer membrane channel (SrpC analogues), and a periplasmic linker protein (SrpA analogues). Members of this family have been shown to be involved in export of antibiotics, metals, and oligosaccharides involved in nodulation signaling. Based on the work presented here, this family can be broadened to include a new class of efflux pump, involved in export of solvents. Dendrograms showing the phylogenetic relationship of SrpA, SrpB, and SrpC to other proteins involved in multidrug resistance are shown in Fig. 5. ThesrpABC-encoded proteins show the most homology with those for the mexAB/oprM-encoded multidrug resistance pump found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (38Gotoh N. Tsujimoto H. Poole K. Yamagishi J. Nishino T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2567-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 39Poole K. Heinrichs D.E. Neshat S. Mol.

The three dendrograms show that the Srp and the Mex proteins fall into a distinct class, separate from but still closely related to the other members of the RND family of efflux pumps. The evolutionary relationship of the solvent resistance pump to multidrug resistance pumps is not surprising since they both function to export hydrophobic molecules from the cell. It is logical that a solvent efflux pump would have evolved since it would enable microorganisms to survive in close proximity to oil or coal deposits (a rich source of carbon and energy) in the environment. There have been several attempts to clone genes that are involved in solvent resistance leading in many cases to the identification of a protein that is somehow involved in making the cell resistant to a single solvent or to a group of related solvents. Most of these studies took place using E. coli that was forced under selective pressure to become solvent resistant. Mutations in a number of different genes can result in an increased tolerance to a particular chosen solvent, any one of which can allow the cell to grow in the presence of the solvent. Genes implicated in increased organic solvent tolerance of E. coli include the uncharacterizedostA (for organic solventtolerance) (40Aono R. Negishi T. Nakajima H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 4624-4626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ahpC encoding alkylhydroperoxide reductase (35Ferrante A.A. Augliera J. Lewis K. Klibanov A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1323-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These genes enhance the survivability of the organism in the presence of a particular solvent but are not responsible for solvent resistanceper se since they do not aid in understanding the true mechanism(s) of solvent resistance found naturally in environmental isolates. This article, however, represents the first example of cloning and characterization of genes for a major solvent resistance mechanism: a proton-dependent solvent efflux pump. We have shown that the cloned genes can be transferred to anotherP. putida strain with the concomitant gain of solvent resistance by that organism. This has far reaching implications for industrial applications in the fine chemistry area. Existing and potential biocatalytic processes for compounds such as catechols, phenols, medium chain alcohols, and enantiopure epoxides are suboptimal because the products formed are very toxic to normal microorganisms. Product accumulation to a concentration which allows economic downstream processing is inherently prevented by the physical characteristics of these compounds. The ability, as demonstrated here, to take a normally solvent-sensitive strain and make it solvent resistant will greatly enhance the ability of a given strain to perform a desired biocatalytic reaction resulting in otherwise toxic products."

Ligand-induced dimerization inhibited the function of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–RPTP CD45 chimera (EGFR-CD45) in T cell signal transduction. Properties of mutated EGFR-CD45 chimeras supported a general model for the regulation of RPTPs, derived from the crystal structure of the RPTPα membrane-proximal phosphatase domain. The phosphatase domain apparently forms a symmetrical dimer in which the catalytic site of one molecule is blocked by specific contacts with a wedge from the other."
https://openalex.org/W2074042976,"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) constitute a family of small monomeric GTPases. ARFs 1 and 3 function in the recruitment of coat proteins to membranes of the Golgi apparatus, whereas ARF6 is localized to the plasma membrane, where it appears to modulate both the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton and endocytosis. Like other GTPases, ARF activation is facilitated by specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). ARNO (ARF nucleotide-binding site opener) is a member of a growing family of ARF-GEFs that share a common, tripartite structure consisting of an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, a central domain with homology to the yeast protein Sec7p, and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain. Recently, ARNO and its close homologue cytohesin-1 were found to catalyze <i>in vitro</i>nucleotide exchange on ARF1 and ARF3, respectively, raising the possibility that these GEFs function in the Golgi. However, the actual function of these proteins may be determined in part by their ability to interact with specific ARFs and in part by their subcellular localization. We report here that <i>in vitro</i> ARNO can stimulate nucleotide exchange on both ARF1 and ARF6. Furthermore, based on subcellular fractionation and immunolocalization experiments, we find that ARNO is localized to the plasma membrane in mammalian cells rather than the Golgi. It is therefore likely that ARNO functions in plasma membrane events by modulating the activity of ARF6 <i>in vivo</i>. These findings are consistent with the previous observation that cytohesin-1 regulates the adhesiveness of αLβ<sub>2</sub>integrins at the plasma membrane of lymphocytes."

https://openalex.org/W3037008719,"A planet orbiting in a disk of planetesimals can experience an instability in which it migrates to smaller orbital radii. Resonant interactions between the planet and planetesimals remove angular momentum from the planetesimals, increasing their eccentricities. Subsequently, the planetesimals either collide with or are ejected by the planet, reducing the semimajor axis of the planet. If the surface density of the planetesimals exceeds a critical value, corresponding to approximately 0.03 solar mass of gas inside the orbit of Jupiter, the planet will migrate inward a large distance. This instability may explain the presence of Jupiter-mass objects in small orbits around nearby stars."

https://openalex.org/W2035415378,"Although the African Plate's northeastward absolute motion slowed abruptly 30 million years ago, the South Atlantic's spreading velocity has remained roughly constant over the past 80 million years, thus requiring a simultaneous westward acceleration of the South American Plate. This plate velocity correlation occurs because the two plates are coupled to general mantle circulation. The deceleration of the African Plate, due to its collision with the Eurasian Plate, diverts mantle flow westward, increasing the net basal driving torque and westward velocity of the South American Plate. One result of South America's higher plate velocity is the increased cordilleran activity along its western edge, beginning at about 30 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2083514445,"The ligation of available α6β1 integrin in adherent LOX melanoma cells by laminin G peptides and integrin stimulatory antibodies induced cell invasiveness, independent of adhesion activity of integrins that were pre-bound to extracellular matrix (Nakahara, H., Nomizu, M., Akiyama, S. K., Yamada, Y., Yeh, Y., and Chen, W.-T. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 27221–27224). Here, we show that this induced invasion involves an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a 190-kDa GTPase-activating protein for Rho family members (p190 RhoGAP; p190) and membrane-protrusive activities at invadopodia. This tyrosine phosphorylation does not occur when the adherent cells are treated with non-activating antibody against β1 integrin, control laminin peptides, or tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A. Although p190 and F-actin co-distribute in all cell cortex extensions, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins including p190 appear to associate with F-actin specifically in invadopodia. In addition, the localized matrix degradation and membrane-protrusive activities were blocked by treatment of LOX cells with tyrosine kinase inhibitors as well as microinjection of antibodies directed against p190 but not by non-perturbing antibodies or control buffers. We suggest that activation of the α6β1 integrin signaling regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation state of p190 which in turn connects downstream signaling pathways through Rho family GTPases to actin cytoskeleton in invadopodia, thus promoting membrane-protrusive and degradative activities necessary for cell invasion.

These findings suggest a role for p190 in connecting actin motility to downstream signaling pathways mediated through different Rho family GTPases.

Soluble peptides and antibodies specific for β1 integrins were added to melanoma cells that had already adhered to immobilized fibronectin and gelatin films and the state of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and membrane-protrusive activities at invadopodia were assessed. The human amelanotic melanoma cell line LOX was obtained and cultured as described (25Nakahara H. Nomizu M. Akiyama S.K. Yamada Y. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J. Biol.

Mouse laminin-1 and all laminin G peptides, including AG-10 (NPWHSIYITRFG) and control AG-10-s (scrambled peptide of AG-10, NYITRFGPWHSI), were prepared as described (23Nomizu M. Kim W.H. Yamamura K.

Rat mAb 13 (against human β1 integrin subunit) was provided by Dr. S. K. Akiyama (NIH, Bethesda, MD).

Suspended cells (105/ml) were added to fluorescein-fibronectin-coated cross-linked gelatin films on a 15-mm round glass coverslip in a 12-well plate for in vitro degradation/invasion assay as described (25Nakahara H.

Tissue Cult. Methods. 1994; 16: 177-181Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to grow on the films for the indicated times, fixed and stained with rhodamine conjugate of phalloidin (against F-actin, Molecular Probes), and antibodies were directed against p190 or other proteins. The cells were further stained with fluorescein conjugate of secondary antibodies. Stained samples were photographed using the Planapo 63/1.4 or 25/1.2 objectives on a Zeiss Photomicroscope III (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) under epifluorescence as described (13Monsky W.L. Lin C.-Y. Aoyama A. Kelly T. Mueller S.C. Akiyama S.K. Chen W.-T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5702-5710PubMed Google Scholar). After treatment with laminin G peptides or anti-β1 integrin antibodies, cell monolayers were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with a modified immunoprecipitation buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm orthovanadate, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 5 mg/ml leupeptin) as described (27Kornberg L.J.

Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Antibodies were added to the lysate (1:100 antibody:protein concentration), and samples were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. To precipitate the antibody-antigen complexes, Gammabind-Sepharose (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the lysates, and rotation was continued for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates, pelleted by low speed centrifuging, were washed three times in wash buffer (buffer A without sodium deoxycholate). For anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, the antibody-antigen pellet was boiled in SDS buffer, electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham Corp.). To detect other proteins shown in Fig. 2, the YPP blot was stripped and reprobed with antibodies against individual proteins, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. LOX cells were seeded on fibronectin/gelatin films that had been coated on a gridded coverslip (CELLocate, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Prior to microinjection, anti-p190 antibodies were dialyzed against PBS for 1 day. Antibody solutions at the concentration of 1 mg/ml were microinjected into the cytoplasm with Femtotip microcapillaries (Eppendorf) using the Eppendorf microinjection system (Transjector 5246/micromanipulator 5171). Mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) at 1 mg/ml was used as a control and in some experiments the injected IgG was localized with fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. In all cases, cells showing a response to the microinjected antibodies contained the mouse IgG inside the cells. To examine tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in cells during the induced matrix degradation, we seeded a human melanoma cell line LOX on immobilized fibronectin-cross-linked gelatin films in the presence of serum and allowed the cells to adhere for 1 h. Serum-free media containing soluble peptides or anti-integrin antibodies were then added to cells for an additional 5 h to assess the induced ECM degradation/invasion. As shown in Fig.1 A (lanes markedm13, AG-10), ligation of β1 integrin by stimulatory anti-β1 integrin mAb 13 or laminin G peptide AG-10 resulted in elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 190, 120–130, and 60–90 kDa in molecular mass as revealed by immunoblotting using anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10. When lysates obtained from cells treated with a non-activating anti-β1 integrin mAb K20, non-immune IgG, or control laminin peptide AG-10-s, major bands around 120–130 and 60–90 kDa could be detected. These results suggest that major 120–130- and 60–90-kDa proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated during continued cell adhesion as described (1Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 2Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), whereas the 190-kDa protein may be involved in the formation of invadopodia. To determine the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on the formation of focal adhesions and invadopodia, LOX cells cultured on fluorescently labeled films and treated with laminin peptides or anti-β1 integrin antibodies were further treated with genistein and herbimycin A. Intense localization of YPPs was observed at invadopodia, which correspond to degradation sites of the fibronectin-gelatin substratum, and at focal adhesions of activated LOX cells (Fig. 1 B). Local ECM degradation and tyrosine phosphorylation at invadopodia were blocked by genistein (5 μg/ml) (Fig. 1 C) and herbimycin A (20 μg/ml), but cells remained attached to the substratum and retained tyrosine phosphorylation at focal adhesions (arrowheads, Fig. 1 C). Following wash out of genistein, cells regained their ability to degrade the films (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 D, laminin G peptide- or β1 integrin antibody-induced cell invasiveness can be blocked by genistein in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, we suggest that a signaling pathway involving YPPs regulates these invadopodial activities. To identify a YPP involved in cell invasion, samples from adherent cells stimulated by β1 integrin antibodies were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against potential molecules, and they were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig.2, upper panel). When immunoprecipitated from adherent cells treated with non-immune IgG or non-activating β1 integrin antibody K20, p190 exhibited very low levels of tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2, left two lanes). Interestingly, p190 from cells treated with stimulatory β1 integrin mAb m13 shows elevated tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2, right lane). Thus, p190 may be the 190-kDa protein that was seen to increase its tyrosine phosphorylation in response to laminin G peptides and β1 integrin antibody m13 (Fig. 1 A). The 120–130- and 60–90-kDa YPPs (Fig. 1 A) are major phosphotyrosine forms during early attachment of cells on the fibronectin-gelatin film (within 6 h). Among these molecules, p120 RasGAP (RasGAP), p120 src substrate (p120 src-s ), cortactin, and pp60 src (Fig. 2) show enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation in cells treated with K20 and m13 antibodies as compared with that treated with non-immune IgG. However, treatment of β1 integrin antibodies had no apparent effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and p130 cas (Fig. 2), which already may be highly phosphorylated in cells adherent on ECM as previously shown (29Kornberg L. Earp H.S. Parsons J.T. Schaller M. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23439-23442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, additional β1 ligation may not produce any detectable change in tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and p130 cas (Fig. 2). We conclude that the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 is implicated in invadopodial activities while that of p120 RasGAP, p120 src substrate, FAK, p130 cas, cortactin, and pp60 src may be due to adhesion and antibody binding to β1 integrins. To study the connection between p190 tyrosine phosphorylation and actin-driven membrane motility, activated LOX cells that had invaded fibronectin-coated gelatin films were labeled with phalloidin (for F-actin) (Fig. 3 A) and anti-p190 (Fig. 3 B). Intense F-actin (Fig. 3 A) and p190 (Fig. 3 B) localization was observed in membrane protrusions such as invadopodia and lamellipodia of activated LOX cells. Their localization corresponded to the YPP labeling (Fig.1 B) observed at the cell-ECM interface, the invadopodia. However, YPP labeling was quite low in lamellipodia (Fig.1 B) whereas p190 and F-actin were intense in these membranes (Fig. 3, short arrowheads). The data suggest that tyrosine-phosphorylated p190 and F-actin co-distribute in membrane protrusions during cell invasion. To further examine the role of p190 in cell invasion, we microinjected antibodies directed against p190 into LOX cells that were cultured on immobilized fibronectin-cross-linked gelatin films and assessed effects of antibodies on ECM degradation/invasion (Fig.4). Effects of antibody injection were determined by counting the number of cells among a total of 25 injected cells in a designated area on fibronectin films. Injection of antibodies up to concentrations of 1 μg/μl or PBS into melanoma cells, which had been plated on fibronectin films for 3 h and cultured for another 5 h after injection, did not affect the number of cells that remained attached 5 h after injection. Microinjection of anti-p190 antibodies into LOX cells blocked their degradative activities (Fig. 4, A and B) whereas that of non-immune IgG did not (Fig. 4, C and D). There was a 10-fold decrease in invasiveness when cells were microinjected with anti-p190 antibodies (p < 0.005) compared with that of cells injected with control non-immune IgG or control saline alone (Fig. 4 E). We conclude that p190 exerts its signaling effects on invadopodial activities through β1 integrins. The biochemical mechanisms by which cell invasiveness is induced are poorly understood partly because of the difficulty involved in defining signaling molecules of invasion. Recently, we have shown that cell invasiveness can be triggered when α6β1 integrin on ECM-free surfaces of the cell is ligated by soluble laminin G peptides or antibodies (25Nakahara H. Nomizu M. Akiyama S.K. Yamada Y. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27221-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Activated α6β1 integrin was shown to induce the recruitment of seprase, a serine-type integral membrane protease, to invadopodia of invading cells, and a subsequent increase of local ECM degradation. In this report, we show that, when α6β1 integrin is ligated by laminin G peptides or antibodies, p190 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with F-actin in a specific membrane protrusion, invadopodia. In addition, the stimulated invasive phenotype was blocked by treatment of LOX cells with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and microinjection of antibodies directed against p190. Thus, activation of α6β1 integrin may regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation state of p190 and its association with F-actin organization at invadopodia. The tyrosine-phosphorylated p190 may serve as a binding site for tyrosine kinases containing SH2 and link the Rho pathway to the actin cytoskeleton, thus promoting membrane-protrusive activities necessary for cell invasion. Following activation of β1 integrins, the tyrosine kinase responsible for p190 phosphorylation remains to be identified. Src family tyrosine kinases are present and active in invadopodia of invasive cells (8Chen W.-T. Chen J.M. Parsons S.J. Parsons J.T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 309-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Thus, c-Src may phosphorylate p190 that in turn may regulate actin polymerization mediated by different Rho family GTPases (16Foster R. Hu K.Q. Shaywitz D.A. Settleman J. Mol. Cell.

Also, p190 associates with membrane-protrusive activities involving Rho-mediated changes in the organization of cytoskeletal actin (20Ridley A.J. Self A.J. Kasmi F. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Marshall C.J. Ellis C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and the decrease in fibronectin adhesion (21McGlade J. Brunkhorst B. Anderson D. Mbamalu G. Settleman J.

Microinjection and tyrosine kinase inhibition experiments present in this report thus support the role of tyrosine-phosphorylated p190 in invadopodial activities. Cell adhesion to ECM promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of many signaling molecules. It has been shown recently that antibody-mediated clustering of α5β1 integrin causes recruitment of p190B and Rho family members to the cell surface (29Kornberg L. Earp H.S. Parsons J.T. Schaller M.

While we show a specific association of p190 tyrosine phosphorylation with invadopodial formation, we have confirmed the observation that antibody activation of integrin promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of pp60 src, cortactin, FAK, p120 RasGAP, and p120 src substrate (Fig. 2). It is possible that tyrosine phosphorylation of these signaling molecules in response to adhesion is a prerequisite for the expression of cell invasiveness. Consistent with the inhibition of invasiveness in cells microinjected with anti-p190 antibody (Fig. 4 E), there was a more than 3-fold decrease in invasive potential when cells were microinjected with anti-FAK, cortactin, or pp60 src antibodies (data not shown). Thus, we suggest that FAK, cortactin, and pp60 src may exert their primary signaling effects on cell invasion through integrin-mediated adhesion on ECM. We are most grateful to L. Howard, L. A. Goldstein (Georgetown University), and Steve Akiyama (NIH) for critical discussion."

https://openalex.org/W2099864152,"κ-Conotoxin Pviia(κ-Pviia), a 27-amino acid toxin from Conus purpurascens venom that inhibits the Shaker potassium channel, was chemically synthesized in a biologically active form. The disulfide connectivity of the peptide was determined. κ-Conotoxin Pviia has the following structure.
Structure I This is the first Conus peptide known to target K+channels. Although the Shaker K+ channel is sensitive to κ-Pviia, the rat brain Kv1.1 subtype is resistant. Chimeras between Shaker and the Kv1.1 K+ channels were constructed and expressed inXenopus oocytes. Only channels containing the putative pore-forming region between the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains of Shaker retained toxin sensitivity, indicating that the toxin target site is in this region of the channel. Evidence is presented that κ-Pviia interacts with the external tetraethyl-ammonium binding site on the Shaker channel. Although both κ-Pviia and charybdotoxin inhibit theShaker channel, they must interact differently. The F425GShaker mutation increases charybdotoxin affinity by 3 orders of magnitude but abolishes κ-Pviiasensitivity. The precursor sequence of κ-Pviia was deduced from a cDNA clone, revealing a prepropeptide comprising 72 amino acids. The N-terminal region of the κ-Pviia prepropeptide exhibits striking homology to the ω-, μO-, and δ-conotoxins. Thus, at least four pharmacologically distinct superfamilies ofConus peptides belong to the same O superfamily, with the ω- and κ-conotoxins forming one branch, and the δ- and μO-conotoxins forming a second major branch."

Metabolically radiolabeled HS was isolated from adenoma and carcinoma cells. The chain length of HS was the same in both cell populations (M r 20,000; 45–50 disaccharides), and the chains contained on average of two sulfated domains (S domains), identified by heparinase I scission. This enzyme produced fragments of approximate size 7 kDa, suggesting that the S domains were evenly spaced in the intact HS chain. The degree of polymer sulfation and the patterns of sulfation were strikingly different between the two HS species.

Heparan sulfate is a widespread complex linear polysaccharide that consists of alternate hexuronic acid and N-substituted glucosamine residues.

Domains of less sulfated sequences called mixed sequences are believed to flank the S domains, separating them from the unsulfated domains, and these are liberated as tetrasaccharides by low pH nitrous acid, a reagent that cleaves HS at N-sulfated glucosamine-containing disaccharides (i.e. GlcNSO3-α1–4-hexuronic acid).The ability of HS to act as a growth factor activator (10Yayon A.

A number of studies have investigated the structural changes in HS in animal models of malignancy with the earliest detailed analyses being performed on SV-40-transformed murine embryo cell lines (15Winterbourne D.J.

These studies showed that transformation was accompanied by a reduction in charge density that was largely due to a decrease in 6-O-sulfation in nitrous acid-resistant tetrasaccharides. Further analyses of normal and transformed mouse mammary basement membrane proteoglycans confirmed that carcinogenesis was associated with reductions in 6-O-sulfation and also of 3-O-sulfation and a reduction in the size of intact HS (18Pejler G. David G. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), changes that were associated with a reduced affinity for antithrombin III.There have been no detailed studies of HS structure in human malignant tissues, but a crude comparison of normal liver and hepatoma tissue showed that there was a reduction in the charge density of HS in the neoplastic tissue (19Nakamura N. Kojima J. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 278-283PubMed Google Scholar).The first in vitro model of the progression of human colon cancer from adenoma to carcinoma was developed recently by Paraskeva and co-workers (20Williams A.C. Harper S.J. Paraskeva C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4727-4730Google Scholar). A cell line with the phenotype of an adenoma was derived from a polyp taken from a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis. Through chemical transformation, a second cell line was derived that was tumorigenic in nude mice and anchorage-independent in soft agar, in contrast to the adenoma cell line. We have used these cell lines to identify the structural changes in HS during the progression from human colon adenoma to carcinoma.RESULTSAdenoma and carcinoma cells were taken at 80% confluence and metabolically radiolabeled for 48 h with [3H]glucosamine and 35SO4. GAGs were extracted from the cell layer by treatment with Pronase in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100; the culture medium was also digested with Pronase, and the medium and cell layer extracts were then pooled and clarified by centrifugation (see “Experimental Procedures”). The GAGs were fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography, and the HS (identified by its degradation by nitrous acid) eluted in a double-labeled peak at ∼0.55 m NaCl (not shown). There was no difference in the NaCl concentration required to desorb the HS produced by adenoma and carcinoma cells. The 3H/35S-labeled HS was cleared of any contaminating chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronan by treatment with chondroitinase ABC. The Sepharose CL-6B elution profiles of intact adenoma and carcinoma HS species were symmetrical, and the position of the peak of elution of each sample corresponded to a chain of average molecular mass 20 kDa, equivalent to 45–50 disaccharides (Fig. 1).Low pH Nitrous Acid Scission of HSThe adenoma and carcinoma HS chains were cleaved with nitrous acid, which breaks HS at the glycosidic bond between N-sulfated glucosamine and uronic acids. The products of scission were eluted by Bio-Gel P-10 gel filtration, and the chromatographs (Fig.2, a and b) show that the major low molecular mass products were either disaccharides derived from the S domains (contiguous N-sulfated disaccharides) or tetrasaccharides of structure hexuronic acid-GlcNAc-GlcUA-aManR, where the aManR(anhydromannitol) is derived from GlcNS in the HS chains. The35S in these peaks represents O-sulfated sugars in the tetrasaccharides, and O-sulfated sugars plus inorganic 35S, released from the N-sulfate groups, in the disaccharide peak.Figure 2Bio-Gel P-10 gel filtration chromatographic analysis of adenoma HS (a, c, and e) and carcinoma HS (b, d, and f) after scission with nitrous acid (a and b), heparinase III (c and d), and heparinase I (e and f).

Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The adenoma HS was more susceptible to nitrous acid scission (37% disaccharides) than the carcinoma HS (32% scission), and 16% of the adenoma HS chain and 13% of the carcinoma HS were present as contiguous N-sulfated sequences (TableI), as revealed by the level of3H radioactivity in the disaccharide peaks in Fig. 2,a and b). In general the data also suggest that the adenoma and carcinoma HS chains maintain a close clustering ofO- and N-sulfate groups and that the general distribution of N-sulfated residues is similar in both chains.Table ISummary of the comparative sensitivities of the adenoma and carcinoma HS species to specific reagentsAdenomaCarcinomaM r of intact chains20,00020,000(K av on Sepharose CL-6B)(0.5)(0.5)M r of heparinase I-resistant chains7,0007,000(K av on Sepharose CL-6B)(0.7)(0.69)% chain susceptible to nitrous acid scission37.032.0% chain-bearing contiguous disaccharides sensitive to nitrous acid16.013.0% chain susceptible to heparinase I scission13.37.3% chain-bearing contiguous disaccharides sensitive to heparinase I3.81.6% chain susceptible to heparinase III scission69.273.6% chain-bearing contiguous disaccharides sensitive to heparinase III59.761.3 Open table in a new tab Heparinase III ScissionHeparinase III (heparitinase) largely cleaves HS at hexosaminidic linkages to glucuronic acid residues (23Linhardt R.J.

Yamada S. Khoo K.-H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) but with reduced efficiency. However, under the conditions of this investigation, resistant fragments are likely to contain mainly nonsulfated and 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid residues (see “Discussion”).The samples of digested adenoma and carcinoma HS gave broadly similar elution profiles, and it was calculated that 69% of the adenoma HS was sensitive to heparinase III scission, whereas 74% of the carcinoma HS was cleaved by the enzyme (Fig. 2, c and d; TableI). One notable difference, however, was that the adenoma HS yielded more hexa- than octasaccharide, but the converse was true in the carcinoma (Fig. 2, c and d). The heparinase III profiles demonstrate that in both HS species, the majority of the GlcUA-bearing disaccharides occur in contiguous sequences, as revealed by the large disaccharide peaks (Fig. 2, c and d). The fragments that are resistant to heparinase III digestion are the sulfated domains (S domains).Heparinase I ScissionTo gain further information on the structure and location of the S domains, the enzyme heparinase I was used. This enzyme cleaves HS essentially where GlcNS(±6S)-IdceA(2S) residues occur (23Linhardt R.J. Turnbull J.E. Wang H.M. Loganathan D. Gallagher J.T.

Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Scission of the intact adenoma and carcinoma chains with heparinase I and elution of the products by Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration (Fig. 1) showed that the K av of the main peak of eluted material was 0.7, suggesting that the average molecular weight of heparinase I-resistant fragments was 7,000 (21Wasteson Å. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar).Smaller fragments were also produced by heparinase I, and these were examined by chromatography on Bio-Gel P-10. The results showed that the adenoma HS gave a significantly higher yield of low molecular weight products (disaccharides and tetrasaccharides) than the carcinoma HS (Fig. 2, e and f). Although 13% of the hexosaminidic linkages in the adenoma HS were susceptible to heparinase I, only 7% of such linkages were cleaved in the carcinoma HS. In addition, the chromatographs suggest that approximately 4% of the adenoma HS disaccharides were present as contiguous heparinase I-sensitive disaccharides, whereas the corresponding figure for the carcinoma HS was about 2% (Fig. 2, e and f; Table I). This was a consistently observed difference and was noted in three separate experiments.Total Disaccharide CompositionHS from adenoma and carcinoma cells was completely depolymerized with heparinases I, II, and III. The disaccharides were separated by strong anion-exchange HPLC, and the results are shown graphically (Fig. 3,a and b) and numerically (TableII). The major disaccharide in both HS species was ΔUA-GlcNAc, which comprised just over half the total disaccharide units; the ΔUA-GlcNSO3 was also a prominent constituent (Table II). However, a number of reproducible differences were present in the O-sulfated disaccharides. In particular, progression to carcinoma was associated with an increase in ΔUA-GlcNAc(6S) but a reduction in ΔUA(2S)-GlcNS. The latter disaccharide is most likely to contain IdceA(2S) in the HS chain and to be located in the S domains, where it will be cleaved by heparinase I. The findings on the content of IdceA(2S) in the two HS species are compatible with the reduced heparinase I sensitivity in the carcinoma-derived material noted earlier (Fig. 2, e and f).Figure 3Strong anion-exchange HPLC analysis of disaccharides and tetrasaccharides derived from adenoma HS (a, c, and e) and carcinoma HS (b, d, and f).

The lower sulfation in the carcinoma HS was due to a 20% reduction in N-sulfation and a 33% reduction in 2-O-sulfation, the observed 24% increase in 6-O-sulfation only partially offsetting the fall in 2-O- and N-sulfation.Analysis of Disaccharides Liberated by Nitrous acid; Comparison with Heparinase-released DisaccharidesThe foregoing analyses indicated that transformation was associated with a reduction in 2-O-sulfation and an increase in 6-O-sulfation. To establish the principal locations of these changes, disaccharides and tetrasaccharides released by nitrous acid scission were examined further by SAX-HPLC. Disaccharides released by nitrous acid provide an indication of the composition of the S domains.The relative proportions of each disaccharide were largely equivalent in the adenoma and carcinoma material except for a striking decrease in the IdceA(2S)-aManR in the carcinoma HS (Fig. 3,c and d). This component corresponds to the Δhexuronic acid(2S)-GlcNS unit in the heparinase-released disaccharides (Table II). Disaccharides of structure GlcUA(2S)-aManR(6S) that elute after IdceA(2S)-aManR(6S) (peak 5) on SAX-HPLC were not detected. The data indicate that the reduction in 2-O-sulfation on transformation occurs chiefly in the S domains. The major 6-O-sulfated unit in the nitrous acid-released disaccharides was IdceA(2S)-aManR(6S), and only very small amounts of the mono-6-O-sulfated units GlcUA/IdceA-aManR (6S), were present (Fig. 3, cand d). This indicates that the majority of the ΔUA-GlcNS (6S) detected in the heparinase digests (Table II) must be present in the tetrasaccharides released by nitrous acid, which correspond to the mixed sequences. Because of the close coupling of N- and O-sulfation in HS, the ΔUA-GlcNAc (6S), which represents 12% of adenoma and 16% of carcinoma HS disaccharides, will also be present mainly in the mixed sequences, which thus contain significantly more 6-O-sulfates than the contiguous N-sulfated regions. Combining the data in Table II and Fig. 3, c and d, we can calculate that approximately 70 and 80% of the total 6-O-sulfates are present in the mixed sequences in the adenoma and carcinoma HS, respectively.Analysis of Nitrous Acid-derived TetrasaccharidesThe structure of the tetrasaccharide products of nitrous acid scission were analyzed by SAX-HPLC and shown to contain non-, mono-, and disulfated species (Fig. 3, e and f). 35S radiolabel in these peaks is O-sulfate that is mainly present at C-6 of GlcNAc and C-6 of aManR (see “Discussion”). The sulfation of each peak was based on the ratio of3H/35S. The results showed that the adenoma-derived nitrous acid-resistant tetrasaccharides consisted mainly of non- and mono-O-sulfated structures (Fig.3 e), whereas the carcinoma contained a significantly higher proportion of monosulfated structures, with some di-O-sulfated material also present (Fig. 3 f). These differences were reproduced in three experiments. The results confirm that variation in O-sulfation of the mixed sequences is an important distinguishing feature between adenoma and carcinoma HS.DISCUSSIONThis paper describes a detailed analysis of the changes in structure of HS in a model of human colon carcinogenesis in vitro (20Williams A.C. Harper S.J. Paraskeva C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4727-4730Google Scholar). The study shows that HS from cultured adenoma and carcinoma cells share a common molecular organization in the form of similar chain lengths and spacing of S domains (Fig. 1). When HS was degraded with either low pH nitrous acid or heparinase III (Fig. 2), the results showed that many of the linkages susceptible to these reagents were contiguous especially in the case of heparinase III (Fig.2). The data indicate that the HS from both samples conform to a domain structure that is characteristic of the HS family (4Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. Lyon M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The adenoma and carcinoma HS were approximately 45–50 disaccharides in length (20 kDa), and the fragmentation by heparinase I to yield a major peak of resistant material with a molecular mass of 7 kDa (Fig. 1) implied that the HS chains contained two evenly spaced S domains.Progression to malignancy was associated with specific structural changes, including a reduction in 2-O-sulfation in the S domains and an increase in 6-O-sulfation in the mixed sequences, which consist of alternate N-sulfated and N-acetylated disaccharides. Previous studies have suggested that O-sulfates in these sequences are mainly present on C-6 of the amino sugars (32Sanderson R.D. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and we assume that this is the case in the HS studied here. Structural changes in the mixed sequences have been reported before in murine models of transformation. These studies reported that tumor cells synthesized HS with a reduced content of 6-O-sulfate (15Winterbourne D.J. Mora P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5109-5120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Winterbourne D.J. Mora P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4310-4320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Keller K.L. Keller J.M. Moy J.N. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2529-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and 3-O-sulfate (18Pejler G. David G. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in the mixed sequences. Our results confirm that these regions are a major target of structural change in carcinogenesis. However, the data show that malignant transformation of human adenomas is accompanied by an increase in mixed sequence 6-O-sulfation mainly associated with GlcNAc residues (Table II). This increase is also revealed by the high content of mono-O-sulfated and di-O-sulfated tetrasaccharides in the nitrous acid scission products (Fig. 3,e and f).The biosynthesis of HS is assumed to follow the heparin pathway of polymer modification in which the addition of 2-O-sulfates to iduronic acid residues occurs before 6-O-sulfation of GlcNS/GlcNAc (1Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar, 33Lidholt K. Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 999-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 34Kusche M. Backström G. Riesenfeld J. Petitou M. Choay J. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15474-15484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The composition of the S domains is compatible with this sequence of events, in that most of the 6-O-sulfate in these domains occur in disaccharides bearing 2-O-sulfate moieties (Fig. 3, c and d). However, in the adenoma HS and particularly in the carcinoma HS, there are more 6-O-sulfate residues in the flanking sequences than in the S domains. Taken in conjunction with the reduction in 2-O-sulfation in the carcinoma HS, the data suggest that the 6-O-sulfotransferases that act on the mixed sequences operate independent of the presence of 2-O-sulfate groups, in accord with findings on the structure of HS produced by a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant defective in 2-O-sulfotransferase (35Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is interesting that in other species of HS the content of 6-O-sulfates is higher in the mixed sequences than in the S domains (28Yamada S. Murakami T. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8696-8705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The data also indicate that there is a reduction in 2-O-sulfation after malignant transformation (Table II; Fig.2, e and f). Since the 2-O-sulfotransferase has a similar amount of iduronate (Table I, heparinase III-resistant fraction) to act on in both HS species, the implication is that the enzyme is acting more efficiently in the adenoma than the carcinoma.Approximately 70% of both the adenoma and carcinoma HS species were sensitive to heparinase III (Fig. 2, c and d), which acts mainly on GlcUA-containing disaccharides (23Linhardt R.J. Turnbull J.E. Wang H.M. Loganathan D. Gallagher J.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 24Lohse D.L. Linhardt R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24347-24355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IdceA-containing disaccharides are relatively poor substrates by comparison. Although activity has been demonstrated against IdceA-containing disaccharides (25Yamada S. Sakamoto K. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. Khoo K.-H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Sugahara K. Tohno-Oka R. Yamada S. Khoo K.-H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), studies with desulfated heparins indicate that in polymeric structures, cleavage of such units is substantially incomplete (27Desai U.R. Wang H.-M. Linhardt R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Our data show that only 13% of the adenoma HS and 7% of the carcinoma HS contained IdceA(2S)-bearing disaccharides (Table II). If heparinase III cleaved all disaccharides containing nonsulfated uronates, then 87% of the adenoma HS and 93% of the carcinoma HS would be depolymerized by the enzyme, levels well above the ∼70% values actually observed (TableI; Fig. 2, c and d). This suggests that the enzyme is predominantly acting on the preferred substrate species,i.e.. GlcNAc/GlcNSO3-GlcUA (23Linhardt R.J. Turnbull J.E. Wang H.M. Loganathan D. Gallagher J.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 24Lohse D.L. Linhardt R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24347-24355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although there may be some limited scission at IdceA residues.The data presented above allow the construction of a simplified composite model of the structure of HS produced by the adenoma and carcinoma cells (Fig. 4). The chains are shown to contain two evenly spaced S domains with internal sites of cleavage for heparinase I. The variations in 2-O-sulfation and 6-O-sulfation in the S domains and mixed sequences of the two HS species are also illustrated.

Aggregating platelets form phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), which has been reported to stimulate in vitro the activity of the proto-oncogenic protein kinase PKB/Akt, as has phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3). It has been assumed that PtdIns(3,4)P2 is synthesized by either 5-phosphatase-catalyzed hydrolysis of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3produced by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or phosphorylation by PI3K of PtdIns4P. We investigated the route(s) by which PtdIns(3,4)P2 is formed after directly activating αIIbβ3 with anti-ligand-induced binding site Fab fragment and report that aggregation does not lead to the generation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but to transient formation of PtdIns3P and generation of PtdIns(3,4)P2, the latter primarily by PtdIns3P 4-kinase. Both this novel pathway and the activation of PKB/Akt are inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, and the calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, constituting the first evidence that PtdIns(3,4)P2 can stimulate PKB/Akt in vivo in the absence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Integrin-activated generation of the second messenger PtdIns(3,4)P2 thus depends upon a route distinct from that known to be utilized initially by growth factors.

The rise in PtdIns(3,4)P2 that follows THR-R stimulation has been correlated kinetically with the regulation of the serine-threonine kinase PKB/Akt (10Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar), although a role for the earlier elevation in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels could not be discounted by these studies. Indeed, both PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 are potent stimuli for PDK1, which phosphorylates PKB/Akt and thereby activates it (11Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J.

Two crucial questions naturally arise: 1) is the mechanism of integrin (aggregation)-induced formation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 different from that used by other receptors?; 2) can PKB/Akt be activated in platelets in the absence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 formation? To address these questions, we have by-passed the need for THR-R stimulation to promote αIIbβ3/FIB-dependent aggregation by taking advantage of the findings that exposure of platelets to the Fab fragment of an antibody directed to β3 (LIBS) favors the conformation of FIB-binding αIIbβ3 (13Frelinger III, A.L.

CSK fractions were also assayed for [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2-phosphatase activity at 37 °C for 10 min, utilizing substrate synthesized by the above kinase reaction and extracted. In other studies, unlabeled platelets were incubated ±calpeptin or wortmannin, followed by FIB or LIBS + FIB and stirring for various periods, or with SFLLRN (25 μm) for 2 min. CSK and Triton-soluble fractions were obtained (2Zhang J. Zhang J. Shattil S.J. Cunningham M.C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol.

PKB was immunoprecipitated from Triton-soluble fractions, and its activity assayed with “Crosstide” peptide as described (20Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). The presence of PKB in CSK fractions was also determined by Western blot (20Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). We observed that exposure of 32P-labeled platelets to LIBS + FIB caused a time-dependent, transient accumulation of [32P]PtdIns3P, preceding the maximum accumulation of [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2, both of which were accelerated by stirring (Fig. 1), which also accelerated aggregation (not shown). Apparently clustering of platelets in an aggregate was required for a full response. Neither LIBS nor FIB alone was effective, with or without stirring. No increase in the amount of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was detectable in response to LIBS + FIB, as determined either by 32P labeling or mass measurements, assayed as described recently (17van der Kay J. Batty I.H. Cross D.A.E. Watt P.W. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5477-5481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, SFLLRN caused an increase in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 mass of 4–6-fold in 20 s; a 4-fold increase was observed for [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. SFLLRN-activated platelet levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 were 35 pmol/5 × 108 platelets. Preincubation of platelets with 20 nm wortmannin or 100 μg/ml calpeptin inhibited the accumulations of PtdIns3P/PtdIns(3,4)P2 by 80/91 and 92/95%, respectively, whereas neither calpeptin nor wortmannin inhibited LIBS + FIB-induced aggregation. The presence of exogenous diC16PtdIns3P had no effect on the amount of [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 that accumulated, whether or not wortmannin was present, which implied that the platelets were intact (see below). When platelets were not labeled to equilibrium, but were labeled briefly with [32P]Pibefore activation by stirring with LIBS + FIB, again increased radioactivity was observed in PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns3Pversus LIBS-free controls. LIBS had only a minor (+10%) effect on incorporation of 32P into PtdIns(4,5)P2, which also argued against LIBS + FIB-induced aggregation causing platelet lysis and thereby increased uptake of32Pi. When the relative amounts of32P on the 1, 3, and 4 positions of the inositol ring of PtdIns(3,4)P2 (the last site to be labeled being the “hottest” phosphate) were analyzed, the 4 position contained the majority of 32P (Fig. 2). In contrast, for platelets exposed briefly to either thrombin or SFLLRN (Fig. 2), the 3-phosphate was the hottest, in confirmation of our earlier findings (4Carter A.N. Huang R. Sorisky A. Downes C.P. Rittenhouse S.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and of reports, utilizing similar protocols, for activated neutrophils (21Stephens L.R.

Nature. 1992; 358: 157-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus, most of PtdIns(3,4)P2 synthesized in response to aggregation by LIBS + FIB is generated via PtdIns → PtdIns3P → PtdIns(3,4)P2, whereas early generation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 caused by THR-R stimulation proceeds primarily via PtdIns(4,5)P2 → PtdIns(3,4,5)P3→ PtdIns(3,4)P2, and/or PtdIns4P → PtdIns(3,4)P2.Figure 2Distribution of 32P on the inositol ring of PtdIns(3,4)P2.Non-equilibrium-labeled, stirred platelets were exposed to LIBS + FIB (open bars), SFLLRN (closed bars), or thrombin (diagonally striped bars).

Graziani A. Carpenter C. Cantley L.C. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22086-22089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We compared the two activities in platelet cytosol and found the 4-kinase to be at least as active as the 3-kinase, but the former activity was unimpaired by 20 nm wortmannin, whereas the latter was inhibited more than 90%. No PtdIns(3,4)P2 5-kinase activity was detectable. The Triton-insoluble fraction of THR-R-activated platelets has been found to contain focal adhesion-like aggregates of αIIbβ3, CSK proteins, and PI3Ks (18Zhang J. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Jaken S.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). When platelets were exposed to LIBS + FIB or FIB (stirred controls), and then CSK was obtained, the specific activity and total activity of PtdIns3P 4-kinase were found to increase 2-fold (Fig. 3) and 3–6-fold, respectively, with LIBS + FIB. Similarly, the specific activities of PtdIns 3-kinase and PtdIns4P 3-kinase also increased 2–3-fold, whereas that of PtdIns(4,5)P2 3-kinase or PtdIns 4-kinase did not increase. The increases were blocked completely by preincubation of platelets with calpeptin, but not by calpastatin or calpeptin added only with the platelet lysis buffer (not shown). Wortmannin inhibited the increase in CSK PI3K activities by up to 96%, whereas PtdIns3P 4-kinase was inhibited by only 4–10%. Hydrolysis of [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 by CSK phosphatase (not shown) was 40–41%, was decreased 92% by 10 μmunlabeled diC16PtdIns(3,4)P2, and did not differ for FIB- versus LIBS + FIB-treated platelets; therefore, the increased production of PtdIns(3,4)P2 in CSK fractions is due to increased kinase activity, rather than decreased phosphatase activity. Other experiments were performed to determine whether platelet exposure to LIBS + FIB would affect PKB/Akt activity. PKB activity was increased up to 3-fold in comparison with FIB controls, paralleling the rise in PtdIns(3,4)P2 levels, and this was inhibited 90–97% by preincubation of platelets with either wortmannin or calpeptin (Fig.4). SFLLRN, causing a 6-fold rise in PtdIns(3,4)P2 in 2 min, and a 3–5-fold (32P or mass assay) rise in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in 20 s, stimulated PKB by 10-fold (2 min), in agreement with the increase in PKB activity reported previously (10Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). PKB, which was immunologically undetectable in CSK from unstimulated platelets, increased substantially in CSK of LIBS + FIB-exposed cells (not shown). We conclude that a novel pathway is employed during αIIbβ3 integrin-dependent signaling in platelets, in which calpain activation may play a crucial role. To our knowledge, this is the first indication of stimulatory control of PtdIns3P synthesis in any cell. Calpain is known to hydrolyze several cytoskeletally associated proteins. Given the inhibition of PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,4)P2 accumulations and of increased CSK PI3K activity by preincubation with calpeptin, but not by calpastatin or by calpeptin added in lysis buffer, it seems likely that calpain hydrolyzes a PI3K or attacks a CSK protein that affects PI3K. Further direct studies with calpain and platelet PI3Ks should help to clarify this issue. The LIBS + FIB-activated PI3K apparently cannot utilize PtdIns(4,5)P2 as a substrate, but acts primarily on PtdIns, as for several recently described PI3Ks from yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian cells. Possible candidates for this role, in addition to a form of p85/PI3K or PI3Kγ (both present in platelets; Refs. 19Zhang J. Zhang J. Benovic J.L. Sugai M. Wetzker R. Gout I. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol.

Rittenhouse S.E. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the activation of PtdIns3P 4-kinase is also calpeptin-sensitive. Under our conditions, the stimulated, calpeptin-inhibitable increase in PtdIns(3,4)P2accumulation is attributable to PtdIns 3-kinase and PtdIns3P 4-kinase, rather than to inhibited 4-phosphatase activity (9Norris F.A. Atkins R.C. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10987-10989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which inhibition would cause a decrease in PtdIns3P levels. Instead, we observe a calpeptin-inhibitable increase in PtdIns3P and no effect of LIBS + FIB on CSK phosphatase activity with respect to PtdIns(3,4)P2 substrate. These findings may have important implications for integrin-linked signaling in a variety of cells. Furthermore, the stimulated increase in PtdIns(3,4)P2, without a rise in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, strongly suggests that the former functions as a signal in its own right. Indeed, the PtdIns(3,4)P2 that accumulates as a result of the increased, coupled activity of PtdIns 3-kinase and PtdIns3P 4-kinase is capable of activating PKB/Akt in the platelet, and PtdIns(3,4)P2 (and possibly PtdIns3P) may prove to have additional targets in this system. These data would imply that, for example, stimulation of matrix-cultured cells by agonists that do not promote PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation or activation of conventional PI3Ks, but do cause wortmannin-inhibitable activation of p70 S6 kinase and PKB/Akt (27Kanda S.

The field-induced change in film thickness, dominated by a large inverse-piezoelectric effect, demonstrates that the “grafting-from” technique forces the chains into a parallel arrangement. The mechanical plate modulus of the film as determined by electrostriction agrees with the theoretical prediction for a single PBLG molecule along the chain axis.

https://openalex.org/W2122934240,"Terbium(III) [Tb(III)] was shown to inhibit the hammerhead ribozyme by competing with a single magnesium(II) ion. X-ray crystallography revealed that the Tb(III) ion binds to a site adjacent to an essential guanosine in the catalytic core of the ribozyme, approximately 10 angstroms from the cleavage site. Synthetic modifications near this binding site yielded an RNA substrate that was resistant to Tb(III) binding and capable of being cleaved, even in the presence of up to 20 micromolar Tb(III). It is suggested that the magnesium(II) ion thought to bind at this site may act as a switch, affecting the conformational changes required to achieve the transition state."

A negative charge at this position is highly conserved between mammalian sodium channel isoforms. We have constructed mutations of the corresponding residue (Asp-1612) in the rat cardiac channel isoform (rH1) and shown that the lowered affinity occurs primarily through an increase in the toxin/channel dissociation rate k off. Further, we have used thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis to demonstrate a specific interaction between this anionic amino acid and Lys-37 of ApB (ΔΔG = 1.5 kcal/mol), a residue that is conserved among many sea anemone toxins. Reversal of the charge at Asp-1612, as in the mutant D1612R, also affects channel inactivation independent of toxin (−14 mV shift in channel availability).

Sequences in this region were as follows, where the capitalized residues denote the position of Glu-1613 (rBr2a) and Asp-1612 (rH1) and asterisks denote the third and fourth helices of channel repeat IV (see Ref. 31Goldin A.L. North R.A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 73-112Google Scholar). PCR primers included the desired mutations and an additional mutation to introduce a silentKpnI restriction site, which did not alter the amino acid sequence but facilitated identification of mutated PCR products. The final PCR products spanned unique BstEII (base pair 4632) and BspDI (base pair 5069) endonuclease restriction sites in rH1 and were subsequently used in the reconstruction of the full-length rH1 cDNA in pSP64t. The entire BstEII toBspDI PCR-generated region found in the full-length construct was completely sequenced by dideoxy methods (32Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and the absence of spurious PCR-generated errors. Expression was first tested in Xenopusoocytes, and the entire coding region of rH1 was subsequently shuttled into the HindIII site in the polylinker of pREP9 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using HindIII (in pSP64t) toHindIII (base pair 6371 in rH1) endonuclease restriction sites. Channels from the rH1-pREP9 constructs were expressed in tsA201 cells (33Margolskee R.F. McHendry-Rinde B. Horn R. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained as described previously (17Benzinger G.R. Drum C.L. Chen L.-Q. Kallen R.G. Hanck D.A. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 434: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Two to three days prior to recording, cells were seeded onto 60-mm culture dishes and transfected with 10 μg of plasmid pREP9-rH1 using a calcium phosphate coprecipitate. Cells were cotransfected with pHook1, and transfectants were visualized with the Capture-Tec bead system (Invitrogen) using supplied protocols. Approximately 30–50% of cells bound beads; virtually all cells binding two or more beads expressed Na+ current (I Na). Pipette solution contained (in mm) 140 Cs+, 10 Na+, 100 F−, 50 Cl−, 10 HEPES, with pH adjusted to 7.3 with CsOH. Bath solution contained (in mm) 140 Na+, 2 Ca2+, 144 Cl−, 10 HEPES, with pH adjusted to 7.3 with NaOH. Because toxin in solution tends to adhere to glassware and tubing, bath solutions containing toxin were supplemented with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) (17Benzinger G.R. Drum C.L. Chen L.-Q.

Toxins ApB, ApA, and ApB mutants were produced in Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3) transformed with the appropriate version of the plasmid pKB-13 as described previously (21Gallagher M.

Circular dichroism spectra of the toxin derivatives used in the present study to confirm proper folding of toxins were determined in a Jasco 710 spectropolarimeter (Easton, MD) equilibrated with camphord 10 sulfonic acid, and the spectra deconvoluted using the standard error of the estimate program supplied by the manufacturer. Recording protocols were generated using Clampex 6.0.2 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) running on a Pentium-based microcomputer and were imposed through a 12-bit DAC controlling an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon). The recording chamber was maintained at 16 °C with a Sensortek TS-4 controller (Clifton, NJ). Currents were 4-pole Bessel filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at 12-bit resolution at 100 kHz. Recordings were made in the whole-cell patch clamp configuration with typical pipette resistances of 0.8–1.5 MΩ. Because the binding of these toxins is state-dependent, with significantly lower affinity for inactivated states than for resting states (35Catterall W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1979; 74: 375-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 36Mozhayeva G.N. Naumov A.P. Nosyreva E.D. Grishin E.V. Biochim. Biophys.

Physiol. 1988; 411: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we held the cells at a sufficiently negative holding potential (−150 mV) to maintain complete channel availability during the duration of the experiment. Our experiments therefore probed the interactions of these toxins primarily with the closed conformation of the channel. Analysis and fitting were performed with locally written programs (GRB, DAH) running under Matlab 5.0 (The MathWorks, Natick MA). Traces were leak corrected based on the resistance calculated from the current at holding potential. The capacity transient was removed through subtraction of summed subthreshold pulses, and traces were digitally refiltered at 5 kHz using a zero-phase fitting algorithm. When the rates of current modification or unmodification by toxin were too fast to resolve with pulse protocols, toxin/channel affinities were calculated using the currents produced by modifying channels with subsaturating concentrations of toxin. We assumed that partially modified I Na consisted of the sum of a quickly decaying component arising from unmodified channels and a slowly decaying phase arising from toxin-modified channels. The current at late times after the start of depolarization was, therefore, assumed to be proportional to the total number of channels modified. Accordingly, we averaged the current over a 7.6–8.0-ms window from depolarization onset (I 7.6, low). Because peak currents increase during toxin modification, we normalized this late current by the initial value of peak current before toxin modification (I peak, low). This ratio was then divided by a similarly calculated ratio for a saturating dose of a higher affinity toxin from another cell (I 7.6, high/I peak, high), yielding the fraction of current modified (f mod). That is as follows. fmod=I7.6,low/Ipeak,lowI7.6,high/Ipeak,highEquation 1 Affinity was then calculated from the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. KD=[T]1fmod−1Equation 2 Interactions between toxin and channel residues were calculated using the formalism of thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis (26Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 27Horovitz A. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In brief, wild-type and mutant forms of toxin and channel were used to calculate a coupling coefficient Ω, Ω=KD(mut,wt)/KD(mut,mut)KD(wt,wt)/KD(wt,mut)Equation 3 where, for example, K D (mut, wt) denotes the affinity of mutant channel for wild-type toxin. The energy of interaction between the two residues was then calculated as follows. ΔΔG=RT lnΩEquation 4 Because affinities were related to coupling energies logarithmically, and because affinities and rate constants both varied over a wide range of values, we chose to calculate errors and significance statistics based on the natural logarithms of the data. We introduced mutations into rH1 at the position identified by Rogers and colleagues (18Rogers J.C. Qu Y.S. Tanada T.N. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15950-15962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) in rat brain channels (rBrIIa). Channels rH1 D1612N and D1612R displayed currents similar to those of the wild-type channel (Fig.1 A). The mutations produced little change in voltage-dependence of conductance (Fig. 1 B,left); the charge neutralization mutant D1612N was very slightly but significantly shifted in a depolarizing direction (p ≈ 0.02, Student's t-test), while the halfpoint of the charge reversal mutation was unchanged. Halfpoints of the conductance curve were as follows: wild-type rH1, −41 ± 1 (n = 14); D1612N, −38 ± 2 (n = 13); D1612R, −43 ± 2 (n = 9). Cells with conductance slope factors <6.0 mV were deemed to be inadequately voltage controlled and were excluded from any further study (38Hanck D.A. Sheets M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H1197-H1207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the charge reversal mutation D1612R displayed a steady-state availability curve 14 mV negative to that of wild-type channels (p ≈ 0.0001), whereas that of D1612N was similar to the wild-type channel (Fig. 1 B,right). Halfpoints of availability were: wild-type rH1, −100 ± 2 (n = 22); D1612N, −101 ± 2 (n = 14); D1612R, −114 ± 2 (n = 9). Paralleling the shift in availability, the kinetics of recovery from inactivation of D1612R were shifted in a hyperpolarizing direction by −16 ± 3 mV across a range of recovery potentials with respect to rH1 (data not shown). Neutralization (D1612N) or reversal (D1612R) of Asp-1612 decreased the affinity for ApB, consistent with results in the neuronal channel isoform (18Rogers J.C. Qu Y.S. Tanada T.N. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15950-15962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). For example, 100 nm ApB modified wild-type rH1 channels to completion but caused only fractional modification of current from the charge reversal mutation D1612R (Fig.1 C). The energies of interaction of the positive residues of ApB with channel residue Asp-1612 were calculated through thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis (26Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 27Horovitz A. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In short, the effects of point mutations of ApB on toxin/channel affinity were tested both in the context of wild-type rH1 channels and in the context of channels mutated at Asp-1612. Differences in the effects of the toxin mutation were quantified as coupling coefficients Ω, which are related logarithmically to the energy of interaction between the particular toxin and channel residues (see “Materials and Methods”). Because association rates of these toxins are 3 orders of magnitude below those predicted by diffusion, we were usually able to calculate affinities using the rate constants of toxin/channel association and dissociation. Once stable whole-cell access was achieved, cells were exposed to and removed from a toxin-containing chamber. During wash-in and wash-out, modification was monitored by 11-ms depolarizations to −10 mV at ≤1 Hz, of which a current window of 7.6–8.0 ms after the onset of each pulse was averaged and plotted (Fig.2 A). For most combinations of toxin and channel, these relations were well resolved by single exponentials, yielding first order rate constants of association,k mod, and dissociation,k off, respectively (Fig. 2 A). From these values, the true second-order association rates,k on, and the affinities, K D, were calculated as follows, kmod=koff+kon[T]Equation 5 where T denotes toxin concentration, and KD=koffkonEquation 6 In most cases, toxin-channel affinities were sufficiently high that modification of I Na was produced at measurable values of k mod. However, in the cases where toxin/channel affinity was quite low (specifically, the binding of all toxins to rH1 D1612R and the binding of ApA to D1612N), a concentration of toxin sufficient to cause appreciable modification produced values of k mod too high to accurately resolve the modification process. In those cases, affinity was calculated from the currents of cells modified to steady-state with subsaturating toxin concentrations, as described under “Materials and Methods.” We verified this technique by calculating the binding affinity of toxin ApB H39A to rH1 D1612N channels both kinetically and by steady-state measurements. The kinetically calculatedK D, 26 nm (25–27 nm, n= 4), agreed well with the equilibrium measurement of 20 nm(13–31 nm, n = 5). Including its α-amino group, ApB possesses six fully positive charges and two histidines (22Reimer N.S. Yasunobu C.L. Yasunobu K.T. Norton T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8690-8693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), any of which might be a candidate for binding to the negative channel residue Asp-1612. Residues Arg-14, His-34, His-39, and Lys-48 have produced only small effects on toxin affinity when neutralized (25Khera P.K. Blumenthal K.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 39Khera P.K. Blumenthal K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 921-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and so were relatively poor candidates for interacting with Asp-1612; similarly, short N-terminal extensions of the toxin have no measurable effect on its affinity (21Gallagher M. Blumenthal K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13958-13963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Kelso G.J. Drum C.L. Hanck D.A. Blumenthal K.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14157-14164Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We tested toxin ApB H39A as a representative of this group. Residues Arg-12 and Lys-49 are known to have a significant and cooperative effect on toxin affinity (23Khera P.K. Benzinger G.R. Lipkind G. Drum C.L. Hanck D.A. Blumenthal K.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8533-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) but are not conserved among all anemone toxins; in particular, they are neutral in ATX-II, the toxin tested by Rogers and colleagues (18Rogers J.C. Qu Y.S. Tanada T.N. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15950-15962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). We tested these residues by using toxin ApA, which has neutral residues at both positions (in addition to several more conservative differences which have been shown to have only minor effects on toxin affinity) (22Reimer N.S. Yasunobu C.L. Yasunobu K.T. Norton T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8690-8693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Kelso G.J. Drum C.L. Hanck D.A. Blumenthal K.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14157-14164Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The remaining residue, Lys-37, significantly decreased the affinity of ApB when neutralized (25Khera P.K. Blumenthal K.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and is also conserved among a number of anemone toxins. It was, therefore, a strong candidate for the interaction and was tested with toxin ApB K37A. As a positive control, we also tested a toxin mutated at a hydrophobic position, toxin ApB W45F. This toxin has lower affinity for cardiac channels than does wild-type ApB (34Dias-Kadambi B.L. Combs K.A. Drum C.L. Hanck D.A. Blumenthal K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23828-23835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) but would not be expected to interact with an anionic channel residue. Values of k off and k onfor wild-type channels and for rH1 D1612N are shown in TableI. The decrease in affinity with channel mutation D1612N arose primarily from an increase ink off, as did the difference in affinity between ApB and ApA, which was consistent with previous results (23Khera P.K. Benzinger G.R. Lipkind G. Drum C.L. Hanck D.A. Blumenthal K.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8533-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The effects of toxin mutation K37A, however, arose from both a decrease ofk on and an increase ink off. These kinetic values were used to calculate toxin/channel affinities (Fig. 2 B), which were then translated into coupling coefficients (Ω) and energies of interaction (Fig. 2 C). Of the tested toxin mutations, only K37A interacted with channel mutation D1612N with an energy significantly different from zero (ΔΔG = 1.5 kcal/mol). We conclude that toxin residue Lys-37 interacts positively with channel residue Asp-1612.Table IKinetic rate constants of toxin binding to rH1 and rH1 D1612NChannelToxinkoff (10−3s−1)kon (106m−1 s−1)nrH1ApB0.5 (0.4–0.7)1.1 (0.8–1.6)5ApA7.6 (5.9–9.7)1.3 (0.9–1.9)4ApB K37A1.2 (0.9–1.5)0.2 (0.1–0.2)4ApB H39A0.2 (0.2–0.3)0.4 (0.3–0.5)4ApB W45F0.7 (0.5–1.0)0.7 (0.7–0.8)3D1612NApB22 (18–25)0.7 (0.5–0.9)7ApA1-aAffinity was determined by equilibrium measurements.ND1-bND, not determined.ND7ApB K37A7.5 (6.0–9.6)0.2 (0.2–0.2)5ApB H39A11 (10–11)0.4 (0.4–0.4)4ApB W45F33 (31–36)0.5 (0.3–1.0)31-a Affinity was determined by equilibrium measurements.1-b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Having demonstrated an attraction between cationic toxin residue Lys-37 and anionic channel residue Asp-1612, we attempted to preserve this interaction by transposing the charges of the two residues. To this end, we constructed the charge-reversed toxin ApB K37D and the charge-reversed channel rH1 D1612R. Unfortunately, circular dichroism revealed that ApB K37D possessed a significantly less ordered secondary structure than that of wild-type ApB or the neutralization mutant ApB K37A (25Khera P.K. Blumenthal K.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Fig.3). Accordingly, ApB K37D bound to both wild-type rH1 channels and to rH1 D1612R with strikingly low affinity (see TableII). Although the calculated interaction was large (ΔΔG = 2.2 kcal/mol), we interpret this “interaction” to arise from aberrant folding of the toxin rather than from the targeted disruption of an ionic interaction between Lys-37 on the toxin and Asp-1612 on the channel. Somewhat surprisingly, the energy of interaction of the neutralized toxin, ApB K37A, with the charge-reversed channel, rH1 D1612R, was only 0.9 kcal/mol, a lower value than that observed when both the channel and toxin residues were neutralized.Table IIAffinities of toxins to rH1 and rH1 D1612RChannelToxinKD (nm)nrH1ApB0.5 (0.4–0.5)5ApB K37A6.7 (5.0–8.9)4ApB K37D220 (170–280)3D1612RApB480 (260–1100)3ApB K37A1400 (900–2600)4ApB K37D4300 (3700–5300)3 Open table in a new tab We have isolated a specific interaction involved in the binding of the site-3 toxin anthopleurin B to the rat cardiac sodium channel. Channel residue Asp-1612 and toxin residue Lys-37 display an energy of interaction of ΔΔG = 1.5 kcal/mol. This coupling energy is less than that expected for a hydrogen bond to a charged residue (41Schulz G.E. Schirmer R.H. Principles of Protein Structures. Springer-Verlag, New York1979: 34-35Google Scholar) but is well within the range predicted for electrostatic interactions (41Schulz G.E. Schirmer R.H. Principles of Protein Structures. Springer-Verlag, New York1979: 34-35Google Scholar). For example, Schreiber and Fersht (42Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) reported values ranging from a noise level of 0.4 kcal/mol up to values typical of H-bonds. Indeed, while neutralization of Lys-37 in the context of a wild-type channel decreased affinity by 15-fold, the mutant channel D1612N was almost insensitive to a charge at toxin position 37. Thus all of the effects of neutralizing toxin residue Lys-37 on the affinity of the toxin are accountable through the actions of channel residue Asp-1612. A comparison of the sequences of 15 homologous toxins isolated from sea anemone revealed all toxins but one, ATX-I fromA. sulcata (43Wunderer G. Eulitz M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 89: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), to have a positive residue at or adjacent to position 37. Interestingly, toxin ATX-I is ineffective when applied to vertebrate sodium channels at 100 μm (5Bergman C. Dubois J.M. Rojas E. Rathmayer W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 455: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Further, an anionic residue at channel position 1612 is highly conserved between mammalian sodium channel isoforms (31Goldin A.L. North R.A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 73-112Google Scholar). These data strongly support the hypothesis that the interaction between Lys-37 and Asp-1612 comprises a conserved component of binding site-3 in mammalian channels. Site-3 toxins act to delay sodium channel inactivation (4Narahashi T. Moore J.W. Shapiro B.I. Science. 1969; 163: 680-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 5Bergman C. Dubois J.M. Rojas E. Rathmayer W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 455: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Romey G. Abita J.P. Schweitz H. Wunderer G. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4055-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because the extracellular face of the channel is not typically thought to be associated with the inactivation process, the manner by which these toxins produce their kinetic effect remains unclear. In light of this ambiguity, it is interesting that reversal of the charge at channel residue Asp-1612 produced a shift in the voltage dependence of steady-state availability. Since perturbation of this residue affects inactivation gating, it is possible that Asp-1612 participates in the control of both the affinity and the kinetic effects of toxin binding. At present, little is known of the structure of the extracellular face of the sodium channel outside of the immediate region of the pore vestibule. The interaction between Asp-1612 and toxin residue Lys-37 provides a defined interaction between the channel and a molecule with a known three-dimensional structure (44Monks S.A. Pallaghy P.K. Scanlon M.J. Norton R.S. Structure. 1995; 3: 791-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The determination of more such interactions should therefore increase our insight into the structure and function of the exterior of the channel.

At least in part these effects would seem to be a result of Cd2+-induced DNA damage. Single strand DNA breaks accumulate in cultured testicular cells treated with CdCl2 (5Shiraishi N. Hochadel J.F.

An enhanced rate of mutation in response to a number of chemical mutagens and UV light has been found in the presence of cadmium, supporting the view that Cd2+ adversely affects DNA repair (6Hartwig A. Environ. Health Perspect. 1994; 102: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Cadmium has been shown to inhibit DNA polymerase β, decrease transcription of O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyl transferase, increase the UV mutation rate in competent but not repair-deficient xeroderma pigmentosum cells, and decrease the removal of pyrimidine dimers (for review, see Ref. 6Hartwig A. Environ. Health Perspect. 1994; 102: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). When quiescent cells enter the cell cycle, expression of immediate early response genes is necessary for progression through G1 and subsequent proliferation (7Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). Many of these are proto-oncogenes that encode nuclear transcription factors and determine subsequent expression of other genes. For example, Fos and Jun protein heterodimers constitute the AP-1 transcription factor that leads to transcriptional activation of many genes (8Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Cadmium causes accumulation of transcripts of c-jun and c-myc in myoblasts (9Jin P. Ringertz N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14061-14064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); c-fos and egr-1 in fibroblasts (10Epner D.E. Herschman H.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc in normal rat kidney fibroblasts (11Tang N. Enger M.D. Toxicology. 1993; 81: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); and c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, and egr-1 in LLC-PK1 proximal tubular cells (12Matsuoka M. Call K.M. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 383-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, Cd2+ has the potential to act as a mitogenic stimulus in some cells. Whereas DNA damage is associated with tumor initiation, effects on oncogene expression and mitogenesis are more likely to be associated with promotion and tumor progression (13Snow E.T. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 53: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Cd2+ can induce apoptosis in isolated T lymphocytes (14El Azzouzi B. Tsangaris G.T. Pellegrini O. Manuel Y. Benveniste J. Thomas Y. Toxicology. 1994; 88: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and cultured LLC-PK1 cells (12Matsuoka M. Call K.M. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 383-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and lead to apoptotic cell damage in canine proximal tubules (15Hamada T. Tanimoto A. Iwai S. Fujiwara H. Sasaguri Y. Nephron. 1994; 68: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and rat testicular tissue (16Xu C.Y. Johnson J.E. Singh P.K. Jones M.M. Yan H.P. Carter C.E. Toxicology. 1996; 107: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Genetic damage triggers apoptosis by a p53-mediated pathway, and a current concept of the action of p53 is that it arrests the cell cycle in late G1 in response to damage, while DNA repair occurs (17Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4523) Google Scholar, 18Lowe S.W. Schmitt E.M. Smith S.W. Osborne B.A. Jacks T. Nature. 1993; 362: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (2767) Google Scholar). If repair is unsuccessful within a certain period of time, apoptosis will be initiated. Thus, Cd2+ may initiate apoptosis by causing DNA damage and inhibiting DNA repair. Alternatively, mitogenic stimulation by Cd2+ against a background of genetic damage may circumvent apoptosis and lead to escape and proliferation of cells destined for transformation. Therefore, Cd2+ may be an interesting agent to explore the factors determining the balance between mitogenesis and apoptosis. Cadmium-related effects on oncogene expression may play a critical role in deciding cell transformation or removal. For example, c-fos expression is part of a mitogenic response that is required for cell proliferation (8Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). On the other hand, numerous authors have described an association between c-fosexpression and apoptosis (19Kroemer G. Petit P. Zamzami N. Vayssiere J.-L. Mignotte B. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), and overexpression of c-fosin transfected fibroblasts increased the apoptotic response to serum deprivation 10-fold (20Smeyne R.J. Vendrell M. Hayward M. Baker S.J. Miao G.G. Schilling K. Robertson L.M. Curran T. Morgan J.I. Nature. 1993; 363: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The outcome may in part relate to the time and amplitude of expression and sustained levels of c-fosmRNA appear to favor apoptosis over proliferation. The present study was undertaken to examine the response of c-fos to Cd2+ in smooth muscle-like mesangial cells, and the role of two major Ca2+-dependent signal transduction pathways involved in c-fos induction.

Phosphocellulose paper circles (P81, 2 cm) were from Whatman, and Hybond-N nylon membrane was from Amersham. Rat mesangial cells (RMC) were cultured from outgrowths of glomeruli harvested by sieving from kidneys of male Wistar rats, and characterized as described previously (21Wang A. Fan M.-Y. Templeton D.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Wang A. Templeton D.M. Kidney Int. 1996; 69: 437-448Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar). They were maintained in 10-cm Petri dishes in a 5% CO2environment at 37 °C, in RPMI 1640 medium with penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% FBS, passaged by trypsinization, and used between the 5th and 15th passages for all experiments reported here. Quiescence was induced by exchanging medium on cells at 60–80% confluence (approximately 5 × 104cells/cm2) with medium containing 0.4% FBS followed by 48 h of incubation. Human mesangial cells (HMC) were cultured from glomeruli obtained from the uninvolved part of a kidney resected for renal cell carcinoma, maintained in an identical manner to the RMC cultures, and used between passages 5 and 10. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent, as described by Chomczynski and Mackey (23Chomczynski P. Mackey K. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 942-945PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of RNA (ca. 10 μg) were denatured by the method of Gong (24Gong Z. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 74-75PubMed Google Scholar), separated by electrophoresis on agarose-formaldehyde gels, and transferred to Hybond-N nylon membrane for hybridization with a c-fos cDNA that was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random primer method. Levels of mRNA were quantitated by densitometry of the Northern blot autoradiographs and normalized to 18 S rRNA after probing with labeled cDNA to rat 18 S rRNA. Nuclei were isolated from RMC by the method of Celano et al. (25Celano P. Baylin S.B. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8922-8927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Seven 10-cm Petri dishes of cells, per experimental point, were lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and homogenized in a sterile Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted at 1000 ×g for 10 min. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of buffer B (36.5% glycerol, 12 mm Tris/HEPES, pH 7.0, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm(NH4)SO2, 10 mm MgCl2, 6 mm MnCl2, 10 mm NaF, 18 μm creatine phosphate, 32 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 300 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA). To start nuclear transcription, 1 mm each of ATP, GTP, and CTP, 100 units of RNAguard, and 200 μCi of [α-32P]UTP were added to the nuclear suspension. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by digestion with 100 units of RNase-free DNase 1 and 10% (v/v) 10 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 15 min. The sample was subsequently treated with 10% (v/v) 10 × SET buffer (5% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4) and 10% (v/v) 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K. Carrier yeast tRNA (100 μg) was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After the incubation, 1 ml of TRIzol was added for RNA isolation according to the manufacturer's protocol, except that three additional cycles of ammonium acetate/ethanol precipitation were performed to remove free [32P]UTP. Purified32P-labeled RNA was hybridized to Hybond nylon membrane with immobilized slots containing 1 μg of c-fos cDNA and 18 S RNA cDNA inserts. The hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 3 days and washed at high stringency (2 × SSC + 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h; 2 × SSC + 0.5% SDS at 22 °C for 1 h) prior to exposure to x-ray film. Cells were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates at 2 × 104 cells per well, and after 16 h the FBS content of the medium was decreased to 0.4% for 48 h. The cells were then treated with fresh medium with or without CdCl2 for various times, and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in 40 μl of reaction solution (137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mmNa2HPO4, 0.4 mmKH2PO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5.5 mmd-glucose, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 100 μm ATP, 50 μg/ml digitonin, pH 7.2) containing 120 μg/ml of the peptide VRKRTLRRL and 10 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, as described (26Williams B. Schrier R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2889-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Each reaction was terminated by adding 20 μl of ice cold 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid on ice and spotted onto phosphocellulose circles prewashed sequentially with water, buffer, and 75 mm phosphoric acid. After standing for 15 min at room temperature, the circles were washed (4 min each with gentle shaking) three times in 75 mmphosphoric acid and once in 2.75 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, before liquid scintillation counting. Quiescent cells in 10-cm Petri dishes were treated with CdCl2 or TPA for various times before being scraped into 800 μL of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF)). Cells were sonicated for 5 s and centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 15 min. Aliquots of cytosol containing 500 μg of protein were precleared by adding 1 μg of normal rabbit IgG with 20 μL of protein A-Sepharose and centrifuging in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. The supernatant was incubated with 2 μg of anti-Erk-2 antibody (3 h, 4 °C) and immunoprecipitates were recovered by incubation (2 h) with a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose. MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) activity in the immunoprecipitates was determined by phosphorylation of myelin basic protein. Immunoprecipitates were mixed with 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein, 2 μmAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, 50 μmATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, reaction mixtures were added to an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer and subjected to 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Incorporation of32P into myelin basic protein was determined by autoradiography and densitometry. Cells in 10-cm Petri dishes were treated with CdCl2 for various times and lysed by several freeze-thaw cycles in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 50 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After brief sonication (3 × 5 s) and centrifugation (10 min at 17,000 × g), the protein content of the supernatant was determined by the method of Peterson (28Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar). Fractions of the supernatant containing 5 μg of protein were incubated with 10 volumes of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) assay buffer at 30 °C for 3 min. The assay buffer for autonomous activity was 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 10 μmautocamtide-2, 1 mm EGTA, and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/ml). For total CaMK II activity, EGTA was replaced with 3 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm calmodulin. The reaction was stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid to 5% (w/v) and after centrifugation the supernatant was spotted onto prewashed phosphocellulose filter paper circles for scintillation counting after extensive washing with 75 mmH3PO4. When RMC are serum-starved (0.4% FBS) for 48 h they become quiescent, reverting to Go, and then when stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle with serum or phorbol ester they begin to express c-fos mRNA within 15 to 30 min (29Miralem T. Wang A. Whiteside C.I. Templeton D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17100-17106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To test if Cd2+ could mimic this mitogenic response, quiescent cells were treated with CdCl2 at 1 or 10 μm. Both concentrations caused an appearance of c-fos mRNA in 30 min (Fig. 1). The higher concentration caused a sustained increase that plateaued at 2 h and remained elevated for at least 8 h. HMC showed similar behavior to RMC with respect to accumulation of c-fos mRNA in response to 10 μm Cd2+. The higher concentration of Cd2+ may initiate additional mechanisms affecting c-fos mRNA, or a larger initial response to the higher concentration could trigger a self-sustaining response. Alternatively, 10 μm Cd2+ may cause inhibition of mechanisms (e.g. phosphatase activity) normally limiting activation of c-fos induction. In keeping with the latter view, TPA (50 ng/ml), an activator of PKC and potent inducer of c-fos in these cells, caused a transient appearance of c-fos mRNA that peaked at 30–60 min and rapidly declined thereafter (Fig. 1). Because c-fos mRNA is rapidly degraded, changes in its stability can rapidly affect its concentration. Therefore, we considered whether some nonspecific effect of Cd2+ such as inhibition of protein synthesis might be affecting mRNA at this level, as was observed for example, with Zn2+ in fibroblasts (30Taylor G.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 10 μm Zn2+ did not cause an accumulation of c-fos mRNA above control levels in RMC (Fig. 2). Cycloheximide, an efficient inhibitor of protein synthesis, increased c-fos mRNA to a level comparable to Cd2+ at 4 h. However, Cd2+ and cycloheximide together had a strongly synergistic effect, increasing the relative amount of c-fos mRNA about 5-fold above either treatment alone in both RMC and HMC (Fig. 2). This suggested that Cd2+ might be inducing c-fostranscription, whereas cycloheximide stabilized the newly synthesized message. To further address the idea that Cd2+ and cycloheximide affected c-fos mRNA by different mechanisms, the rate of decay of the message was measured in actinomycin D-treated cells (Fig.3). Subconfluent RMC were first treated with Cd2+ for 4 h or TPA for 30 min, and then RNA synthesis was stopped with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). Whether c-fos mRNA was induced by TPA or allowed to accumulate in the presence of Cd2+, it was degraded at a comparable rate. However, cycloheximide prevented any detectable degradation over 90 min (Fig. 3). Because c-fos mRNA turnover is fully blocked by cycloheximide, the large synergistic effect of Cd2+ plus cycloheximide on the mRNA level cannot be due to further inhibition of degradation by Cd2+ but must result from induction by Cd2+ together with prevention of turnover by cycloheximide. To demonstrate transcriptional activation of c-fos by Cd2+, a nuclear run-on assay was performed. In four separate experiments, labeled transcripts hybridizing to c-fos cDNA in nuclear extracts of cells treated with 10 μm CdCl2for 4 h exceeded hybridization from extracts of control cells by 1.8–4.9-fold (mean 3.4-fold) when corrected for hybridization to 18 S cDNA. A typical slot blot is shown in Fig.4.Figure 4Representative blot from nuclear run-on assays. Quiescent RMC were transferred to serum-free medium (Control) or medium containing 10 μmCdCl2 for 4 h, and then nuclei were isolated for transcription run-on as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Labeled transcripts were hybridized to immobilized cDNAs for c-fos or 18 S rRNA as indicated and subjected to autoradiography. Bars show the mean ± S.E. of the ratio of intensity of the c-fos signal to the 18 S rRNA signal from four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that heparin inhibits induction of c-fos in RMC through at least two major pathways, one operating through activation of MAPK and another independent of MAPK and dependent on intracellular Ca2+ (29Miralem T. Wang A. Whiteside C.I. Templeton D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17100-17106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether these signaling pathways were involved in the response to Cd2+, we determined whether heparin affected c-fos mRNA levels in Cd2+-treated cells. In both RMC and HMC (Fig. 2), heparin (1 μg/ml) caused a diminution in the increase in c-fos mRNA observed with Cd2+ treatment. This was not due to inhibition of Cd2+ uptake. The rate of 109Cd2+uptake by RMC was unaffected by heparin at concentrations used in these experiments (data not shown), as predicted from polyelectrolyte binding theory in the presence of millimolar Ca2+ and Mg2+. Several kinase inhibitors were used to examine the possible involvement of kinase cascades in the response to Cd2+ at 4 h. None of the inhibitors alone caused a significant increase in c-fos mRNA above basal levels (data not shown). Genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, caused a significant decrease (Table I). Genistein had no effect on the uptake of Cd2+ by the cells (data not shown). At concentrations that inhibited ionomycin-dependent CaMK-mediated induction of c-fos but did not affect induction in response to serum stimulation, 2Miralem, T., and Templeton, D. M. (1997)Biochem. J., in press. neither the general CaMK inhibitor, KT 5926, nor the CaMK II-specific inhibitor, KN-93, caused any significant diminution in the response of c-fos mRNA to Cd2+. The PKC inhibitor, calphostin C, was also without effect. However, staurosporine, a relatively nonspecific inhibitor of several kinases including PKC (32Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 135: 397-402Crossref Scopus (2224) Google Scholar) and CaMK (33Yanagihara N. Tachikawa E. Izumi F. Yasugawa S. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), decreased c-fos induction by about 70%. Therefore, to confirm that neither PKC nor CaMK were involved in the response to Cd2+, we measured the activity of PKC and CaMK directly.Table IEffect of various kinase inhibitors on c-fos mRNATreatmentc-fosmRNA/18 S rRNA mean ± S.D.Significance%Control100Cd2+425 ± 38Cd2++ genistein318 ± 34p = 0.02Cd2+ + KN-93528 ± 139N.S.1-aN.S., not significant.Cd2+ + KT 5926407 ± 250N.S.Cd2+ + calphostin C381 ± 94N.S.Cd2+ + staurosporine133 ± 35p = 0.00031-a N.S., not significant. Open table in a new tab When calmodulin is activated, one consequence is autophosphorylation of CaMK II, with the development of autonomous (i.e.calmodulin-independent) CaMK II activity. Transfer of synchronized RMC to serum-free medium with or without 10 μmCd2+ resulted in an apparent early increase in autonomous CaMK II activity within about 15 min that nevertheless failed to reach significance (data not shown). Thereafter, autonomous activity declined with time, irrespective of the presence of Cd2+, suggesting an effect of serum deprivation rather than Cd2+ on basal CaMK II activity. Furthermore, 10 μm Cd2+added to the assay reaction mixture in vitro had no effect on either autonomous or total CaMK II activity (data not shown). This decrease was paralleled by a decrease in total CaMK II activity, measured by activation with the excess Ca2+ and calmodulinin vitro, suggesting decreased synthesis or increased degradation of CaMK II in serum-free conditions and indicating that activation of CaMK II by Cd2+ is not the mechanism responsible for induction of c-fos by Cd2+. To further confirm this, the concentration dependence of autonomous CaMK II activity after 1 h treatment with Cd2+ was measured (Fig. 5). After 1 h, when serum deprivation was beginning to cause a decrease in both autonomous and total CaMK II activity, Cd2+ exposure caused a dose-dependent decrease in autonomous activity that became significant at 5 μm. Under these conditions, Cd2+ had no significant effect on total CaMK II activity, up to the highest concentration tested (20 μm). When RMC growing in 10% FBS were transferred to serum-free medium, there was an initial decrease in total PKC activity, followed by a rebound to a variable and somewhat higher than control value over several hours. This pattern was unaffected by the presence of Cd2+ (data not shown). The increase was insufficient to induce c-fos and does not account for the induction seen with Cd2+, for example in Fig. 1, because no increase in c-fos mRNA was detected on Northern blots from serum-free controls. To further rule out activation of PKC by Cd2+, cells were treated for 4 h with between 5 and 30 μm CdCl2 in serum-free conditions. PKC activity was not increased above the serum-free control. Furthermore, a similar treatment with Cd2+ failed to augment the increase in PKC activity caused by treatment with TPA (50 ng/ml) during the last 30 min of the 4 h treatment period or to overcome inhibition of PKC by staurosporine (data not shown). In keeping with the failure of calphostin C to inhibit the induction of c-fos by Cd2+, PKC appears not to be involved in the process. Although Cd2+ did not activate PKC, it might activate MAPK via other pathways. Therefore, we measured MAPK activity in RMC at different times after treating quiescent cells with 10 μmCd2+. Cadmium caused an increase in immunoprecipitable MAPK activity that peaked at 15 min and then declined but remained above control levels for several hours (Fig.6). To determine whether a sustained increase in MAPK was responsible for the sustained increase in c-fos mRNA, we used the MEK-1/2-specific inhibitor PD98059. This flavone prevents the activation of MAPK by inhibiting the MAPK kinases, MEK-1 and MEK-2 (34Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The three genes, named β3GalT-I, -II, and -III, encode type II transmembrane proteins of 326, 422, and 331 amino acids, respectively. The three proteins constitute a distinct subfamily as they do not share any sequence identity with other eucaryotic galactosyltransferases. Also, the entire protein-coding region of the three β3GalT genes was contained in a single exon, which contrasts with the genomic organization of the β1,4- and α1,3-galactosyltransferase genes. The three β3GalT genes were mainly expressed in brain tissue. The expression of the full-length murine genes as recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells revealed that the β3GalT enzymes share the same acceptor specificity for β-linked GlcNAc, although they differ in their K m for this acceptor and the donor UDP-Gal. The identification of β3GalT genes emphasizes the structural diversity present in the galactosyltransferase gene family.

Also, the entire protein-coding region of the three β3GalT genes was contained in a single exon, which contrasts with the genomic organization of the β1,4- and α1,3-galactosyltransferase genes. The three β3GalT genes were mainly expressed in brain tissue. The expression of the full-length murine genes as recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells revealed that the β3GalT enzymes share the same acceptor specificity for β-linked GlcNAc, although they differ in their K m for this acceptor and the donor UDP-Gal. The identification of β3GalT genes emphasizes the structural diversity present in the galactosyltransferase gene family. The structural diversity of glycoconjugates results from the combined action of glycosidases and glycosyltransferases that are differentially expressed throughout tissues. Until recently, each carbohydrate linkage was believed to be catalyzed by one single glycosyltransferase. Deduced from this assumption, it was estimated that ∼250 genes were required for shaping the glycoconjugate repertoire of vertebrates (1Varki A. Marth J.D. Semin. Dev. Biol. 1995; 6: 127-138Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This count is constantly corrected to a higher mark as many glycosyltransferase activities are found to be encoded by multiple related genes. This apparent redundancy likely reflects a selective preference of glycosyltransferase isozymes for related although distinct acceptor structures, as observed for α1,3-fucosyltransferase (2Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20987-20996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and GalNAc α2,6-sialyltransferase (3Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T.

Various strategies have been applied to identify genes related to known glycosyltransferase genes. The use of low stringency hybridization was only successful to detect very closely related genes, as was the case for α1,3-fucosyltransferases (6Weston B.W. Smith P.L. Kelly R.J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24575-24584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Weston B.W. Nair R.P. Larsen R.D. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4152-4160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Often, the comparison of related glycosyltransferase genes unveils conserved regions that correspond to residues essential for catalytic activity. Such comparisons performed on sialyltransferase genes led to the detection of a stretch of conserved sequences called the sialyl motif (8Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11504-11507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By designing degenerate primers according to the sialyl motif, it has been possible to isolate additional sialyltransferase genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EST, expressed sequence tag; β3GalT, β1,3-galactosyltransferase; ORF, open reading frame; pNP,p-nitrophenol; Bzl, benzyl; NP-HPLC, normal phase high performance liquid chromatography; bp, base pair(s).

The recent availability of “single-pass” cDNA sequences, or expressed sequenced tags (ESTs), represents a tremendous amount of information that can be analyzed to retrieve sequences sharing limited but significant sequence similarity. This approach is particularly well suited to detect similarity at the level of the protein sequence, which would be difficult to isolate by DNA-based retrieval techniques such as cross-hybridization and PCR. We have applied the EST screening procedure to identify genes encoding β1,3-galactosyltransferases, which refers to an activity yet uncharacterized at the genetic level. To this end, we have probed the EST division of the GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank with the sequence of a β-galactosyltransferase protein that was believed to encode a β1,3-galactosyltransferase (β3GalT) (10.Kyowa Hakko Kogyo, K. K. (July 5, 1994) Japanese Patent JP6181759.Google Scholar). This procedure led to the identification of novel open reading frames (ORFs) that were similar to the query β-galactosyltransferase, but distinct from the previously described α1,3-galactosyltransferase (11Joziasse D.H.

Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) genes. We have used probes designed after these ORFs to isolate the corresponding genes from a mouse genomic library. We have cloned three genes coding for proteins of 326, 422, and 331 amino acids. The three proteins are type II transmembrane proteins containing a single transmembrane domain of 17–19 amino acids. The sequence identity between the three proteins was the highest in the luminal domain, where it ranged from 35 to 51%. Several conserved motifs were detected in the catalytic domain. None of these motifs were present in α1,3- and β1,4-galactosyltransferases, although one motif was identified in some bacterial galactosyltransferases. The expression of the three murine genes as recombinant baculoviruses in Sf9 insect cells confirmed them as encoding UDP-galactose:β-N-acetylglucosamine β1,3-galactosyltransferase enzymes. The genomic organization of the murine β3GalT-I, -II, and -III genes differed from that of β1,4-galactosyltransferase (14Russo R.N. Shaper N.L. Shaper J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3324-3331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and α1,3-galactosyltransferase (15Joziasse D.H. Shaper N.L. Kim D. van den Eijnden D.H. Shaper J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5534-5541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) genes. The entire protein-coding region of the murine β3GalT genes was contained in a single exon. Northern blot analysis showed that the three genes were mainly expressed in brain tissue and also at lower levels in other tissues. The mouse 129/SvJ genomic library, Duralose-UV nitrocellulose membranes, and the Bluescript SKII plasmid were purchased from Stratagene. The Vent polymerase, restriction enzymes, and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. The AmpliTaq FS Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit, the CentriSep columns, and the ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer were from Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems. The baculovirus expression system Bac-to-Bac and Grace's medium were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Carbohydrate acceptors and donors were purchased from Sigma. Asialo-ovine submaxillary mucin was a gift from Dr. Robert L. Hill (16Hill Jr., H.D. Reynolds J.A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3791-3798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Galβ1,4GlcNAc-β-pNP was generated enzymatically by the action of recombinant human β1,4-galactosyltransferase (17Malissard M. Borsig L. Di Marco S. Grütter M.G. Kragl U. Wandrey C. Berger E.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the Galβ1,3GlcNAc-β-pNP standard was purchased from Sigma. The HPLC system consisted of a Jour Research X-ACT degasser, two Waters 510 pumps, a Waters 717 autoinjector, a Jasco C0965 Column Heater (30 °C), and a Waters 490 programmable multi-wavelength detector (214, 262, and 350 nm). The system was controlled using Waters Millennium (Version 2.15.2). UDP-[14C]Gal and Hybond-N nylon membranes were from Amersham Corp. Sep-Pak C18cartridges were obtained from Waters, and GFA glass-microfiber filters were from Whatman. [32P]CTP was purchased from Hartmann Analytics (Braunschweig, Germany). The mouse genomic library was plated onto Luria-Bertani agar, and plaques were lifted onto Duralose-UV filters. The filters were hybridized to [32P]CTP-labeled DNA probes designed after the EST sequences that were similar to a human galactosyltransferase gene (10.Kyowa Hakko Kogyo, K. K. (July 5, 1994) Japanese Patent JP6181759.Google Scholar). The genomic inserts from the phage clones were subcloned asNotI-NotI fragments into the NotI site of the pBluescript SKII vector, and regions that hybridized to the EST fragments were further subcloned into pBluescript and sequenced. Sequencing was done using the AmpliTaq FS Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit with the vectors T3 and T7 matching primers flanking the cloned inserts in pBluescript. Sequenced products were purified with CentriSep columns and run on an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer. Primer walking was used afterward for sequence determination throughout the complete coding region of every β3GalT gene. The sequences of the coding and complementary strands were determined and edited using the Sequencher program (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). Recombinant baculoviruses were generated using the transposon-mediated insertion system developed by Luckow et al. (18Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The mouse β3GalT-I, -II, and -III genes were amplified by PCR from the genomic clones using 5′-primers containing an EcoRI site (β3GalT-I) or a BamHI site (β3GalT-II and -III) just upstream of the ATG codon. The 3′-primers for the three β3GalT genes contained a XbaI site following the stop codon. The conditions for PCR were 20 cycles at 95 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s using the Ventpolymerase and 50 ng of plasmid DNA as template. The resulting PCR fragments were subcloned into the baculovirus donor vector FastBac1 opened at the EcoRI and XbaI sites (β3GalT-I) or at the BamHI and XbaI sites (β3GalT-II and -III). Following the instructions of the manufacturer, the FastBac1-β3GalT plasmids were transformed into DH10Bac cells for transposition into the bacmid. The integration of the β3GalT genes in the bacmids was confirmed by PCR using the 5′-primers specific for each β3GalT-I gene and the m13r primer (5′-AACAGCTATGACCATGATTACG-3′), which binds to a bacmid region outside of the transposition element. Sf9 cells (106) were transfected with 1 μg of recombinant bacmid DNA using Cellfectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated for 3 days at 27 °C. The culture medium was saved as the primary baculovirus stock. The primary stocks were amplified three times to reach titers of ∼109 plaque-forming units/ml. Sf9 cells were infected at a multiplicity of 10 and further incubated at 27 °C for 72 h. Baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lyzed in 2% Triton X-100 for 15 min on ice. Nuclei were removed from the lysates by centrifugation at 500 × g. 10 μl of the lysates were assayed for 30 min at 37 °C in 50-μl reactions of 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 6.6, 10 mmMnCl2, 0.5 mm UDP-Gal, 1% Triton X-100, 10% Me2SO, and varying acceptors at different concentrations (see Table II). 105 cpm of UDP-[14C]Gal (164 pmol) were added to standard assays, whereas 2.5 × 105 cpm of UDP-[14C]Gal (410 pmol) were added when kinetic parameters were determined. The reactions were stopped by dilution with 500 μl of H2O and applied onto a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. The cartridge was washed with 15 ml of H2O and eluted with 5 ml of methanol. The samples containing asialo-ovine submaxillary mucin as acceptor were stopped by adding 1 ml of cold 15% trichloroacetic acid and 5% phosphotungstic acid solution. The precipitates were collected on GFA glass-microfiber filters, which were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold ethanol and dried at 80 °C for 30 min. The amount of [14C]Gal in the methanol eluates and on the GFA filters was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Rackbeta, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.).Table IIAcceptor substrate specificity of the three mouse β3GalT enzymesAcceptorSf9 mock2-aLysate of Sf9 cells infected with a wild-type baculovirus.β3GalT-Iβ3GalT-IIβ3GalT-IIIpmol/min/mg proteinGlcNAc-β-pNP (10 mm)1410,616407313GlcNAc-β-Bzl (10 mm)86834173115GlcNAc-α-Bzl (10 mm)73081516GlcNAcβ1,3GalNAc-α-pNP (2.5 mm)912386GalNAc-β-pNP (10 mm)10892111GalNAc-α-pNP (10 mm)266275268261Asialo-OSM2-bAsialo-OSM, asialo-ovine α submaxillary mucin.

Open table in a new tab Sep-Pak C18 eluates of β3GalT-I, -II, and -III assays using unlabeled UDP-Gal with GlcNAc-β-pNP as acceptor were dried by centrifugal evaporation and redissolved in 100 μl of H2O. A 20-μl aliquot of this material was diluted with acetonitrile to 100 μl and subjected to normal phase (NP) HPLC. NP-HPLC was carried out using the 50 mm ammonium formate pH 4.4 buffer system on a GlycoSep-N column (Oxford GlycoSciences, Abingdon, United Kingdom) over 180 min as described previously (19Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Prime S.B. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The pNP-labeled disaccharides were isolated from the sample mixture by comparison to standard UDP, UDP-Gal, GlcNAc-β-pNP, Galβ1,3GlcNAc-β-pNP, and Galβ1,4GlcNAc-β-pNP. The fractions containing the disaccharides were pooled and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (20Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Dwek R.A. Jackson P.L. Gallagher J.T. A Laboratory Guide to Glycoconjugate Analysis. 11. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 199-234Google Scholar) to separate Galβ1,3GlcNAc-β-pNP and Galβ1,4GlcNAc-β-pNP. Briefly, the first step of the gradient applied to a GlycoSep-R column (Oxford GlycoSciences) consisted of isocratic elution with 75% Solvent A (25% 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.4, in acetonitrile) and 25% Solvent B (50 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.4) over 10 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. This was followed by a linear gradient of 75 to 25% Solvent A over 20 min, followed by a 5-min isocratic step under these conditions. The column was re-equilibrated in the initial solvent composition 20 min prior to the next injection. Streptococcus pneumoniae β-galactosidase (Oxford GlycoSciences) digestions were performed at 37 °C for 16–24 h in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, at 27 milliunits/ml. At this concentration, the enzyme cleaves only the Galβ1,4HexNAc linkage (21Jacob G.S. Scudder P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the aqueous sample was mixed with acetonitrile at a ratio of 20:80 and applied to the NP-HPLC column. Total RNA from 8-week-old ICR mouse tissues was isolated with guanidinium isothiocyanate, followed by centrifugation on cesium chloride cushions (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.19-7.22Google Scholar). 5 μg of total RNA from each tissue were separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels. RNA was either stained in ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml in 0.1 m ammonium acetate) or transferred to Hybond-N membranes by capillary elution. Filters were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with [32P]CTP-labeled probes corresponding to the full-length mouse β3GalT-I, -II, and -III genes. The filters were washed with 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS up to 60 °C and exposed for 3 days at −70 °C using intensifying screens. The αEST division of the GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank was searched for sequences similar to a human β-galactosyltransferase protein (βxGalT) (10.Kyowa Hakko Kogyo, K. K. (July 5, 1994) Japanese Patent JP6181759.Google Scholar) that was regarded as a possible β3GalT. The query sequence was compared with the data base using the tblastn algorithm (Version 1.4.9) (23Altschul S.F. Boguski M.S. Gish W. Wootton J.C. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). ESTs bearing the National Center for Biotechnology Information sequence identification numbers R13867,D81474, H14861, R61672, R13064, R15977, T31289, H70585, H70574, Z43147, and Z45582 were identified as being significantly similar to the query βxGalT sequence (Table I). It is noteworthy that we have not detected any EST that is identical to the probed βxGalT, indicating that this gene is not represented yet in the EST data base. The retrieved EST sequences were aligned with the query sequence, and partially overlapping ESTs were assembled to build larger ORFs (Table I). DNA fragments corresponding to the βxGalT gene and to EST probes D81474, H70574, and R15977 were amplified by PCR from a pool of human T-cell cDNAs. The resulting fragments were used as DNA probes in screening a mouse genomic DNA library. We could isolate seven clones, which represented three distinct genomic regions. The three fragments 6, 10, and 13 encompassed the same genomic region and hybridized to EST probe D81474. Both genomic fragments 5 and 14 hybridized to EST probes H70574 and R15977, indicating that the assembled ORF2 and ORF3 were parts of the same gene. Genomic fragments 2 and 15 included the murine βxGalT gene (Table I).Table ICloning of mouse genomic fragments related to a human β-galactosyltransferase genea kbp, kilobase pairs. Open table in a new tab a kbp, kilobase pairs. The genomic regions hybridizing to the probes were sequenced, and the deduced genes were tentatively named β3GalT-I, -II, and -III. The β3GalT genes were aligned with the originally identified ESTs (TableI) and additional related ESTs that were retrieved from the EST data base with the blastn algorithm (Fig. 1). This comparison confirmed ORF2 and ORF3 as being parts of the β3GalT-III gene. Also, it appeared that the sequence of the human β3GalT-III gene could be entirely determined by joining contiguous EST fragments. No EST corresponding to the β3GalT-I gene could be identified in the αEST data base using the blastn, blastx, and tblastx programs. The murine β3GalT-I, -II, and -III genes code for proteins of 326 amino acids (Fig. 2), 422 amino acids (Fig. 3), and 331 amino acids (Fig. 4), respectively. The β3GalT-II and -III genes contain two in-frame ATG codons spaced by 12 and 11 amino acids, respectively. It is unclear whether the first, second, or both ATG codons are used as the start codon. It appears, however, that in both genes, the proximal ATG codons have stronger contexts for translation initiation (24Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar). A Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy analysis detected single membrane-spanning domains of 19, 19, and 17 amino acids for the β3GalT-I, -II, and -III proteins, respectively (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). The transmembrane domains are located close to the N terminus of each protein, which is typical of the type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase protein family. The protein-coding regions of β3GalT-I, -II, and -III are contained in a single exon. However, more proximal untranslated exons might exist, as is the case for other glycosyltransferase genes (25Hull E. Sarkar M. Spruijt M.P. Hoppener J.W. Dunn R. Schachter H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Koyama N. Miyoshi E. Ihara Y. Kang R. Nishikawa A. Taniguchi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This assumption is supported by the fact that no TATA box sequence was detected in front of the β3GalT genes. Also, we noticed that the cDNAs of the three β3GalT genes contain ∼500 bp of untranslated sequence that differs from the genomic sequence 5′ of the ATG codons (data not shown).Figure 3Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the murine β3GalT-II gene.

Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). The greatest identity was observed in the catalytic domains of the proteins. In this region, β3GalT-I was 51% identical to β3GalT-II and 36% identical to β3GalT-III, whereas β3GalT-II was 35% identical to β3GalT-III. The β3GalT enzymes shared no sequence similarity in their N-terminal part corresponding to the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and stem regions. We noticed that the larger size of β3GalT-II reflects a longer stem region, whereas the size of the catalytic domains is conserved among the three β3GalT enzymes. The positions of six cysteine residues in the catalytic domains of the three β3GalT proteins were conserved (Fig. 5). This supports the formation of up to three disulfide bridges that would confer a similar structure to the three β3GalT enzymes. Such related conservations of cysteine residues have been previously observed in the sialyltransferase protein family (28Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 1993; 1: 2-3Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Several conserved motifs emerged from the alignment of the β3GalT protein sequences (Fig. 5). Notably, we did not detect these same motifs in β1,4- and α1,3-galactosyltransferase sequences, indicating that there are no consensual galactosyl motifs in vertebrate galactosyltransferases. However, a variation of the β3GalT motif EDVYVG was recognized in the bacterial galactosyltransferases Lex1 (29Cope L.D. Yogev R. Mertsola J. Latimer J.L. Hanson M.S. McCracken Jr., G.H. Hansen E.J.

This conservation was also detected by others and described as a putative galactosyltransferase motif (32Yuan Y.P. Schultz J. Mlodzik M. Bork P.

We have found the β3GalT genes to be predominantly expressed in brain tissue, whereas lower transcript levels were also detected in other tissues (Fig. 7). Beside brain tissue, the 7-kilobase β3GalT-I mRNA was detected at low levels in all tissues examined, indicating a possible constitutive expression. Two additional smaller transcripts were also observed in colonic tissue. The β3GalT-II transcript was 3 kilobases long and was present in brain and heart tissue and could barely be detected in ovaries, colon, and lymph nodes. The expression of β3GalT-III yielded a 2.7-kilobase transcript that was restricted to brain, testes, ovaries, and uterus. In addition, the three β3GalT genes were expressed in lymphoid cells as detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR (data not shown). Sf9 insect cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing the three β3GalT genes under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. The lysates of Sf9 cells harvested at 72 h post-infection were assayed for galactosyltransferase activity using various acceptor saccharides (Table II). The highest activity was detected with β-conjugated GlcNAc acceptors like GlcNAc-β-pNP and GlcNAc-β-benzyl (Bzl). By contrast, the α-conjugated GlcNAc acceptors yielded a 10–20-fold lower activity compared with the β-conjugates. No significant galactosyltransferase activity was measurable toward GalNAc acceptors. This finding was corroborated by assays performed in the presence of the high molecular weight acceptor asialo-ovine submaxillary mucin, which carries multipleO-linked GalNAc monosaccharides (16Hill Jr., H.D. Reynolds J.A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3791-3798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the three β3GalT enzymes failed to transfer GlcNAc or GalNAc to the acceptors GlcNAc-β-Bzl, Gal-β-Bzl, and GalNAc-β-Bzl, showing that the proteins are solely galactosyltransferases (data not shown). The activity of the three β3GalT proteins was strictly dependent on the divalent cation Mn2+ (data not shown). Also, the proteins were more active in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 (data not shown). The enzymatic properties of the three β3GalT proteins were determined for the donor UDP-Gal and the acceptor GlcNAc-β-pNP (TableIII). When compared with β3GalT-I, we found that β3GalT-II and β3GalT-III exhibited 3- and 2-fold higherK m values for GlcNAc-β-pNP, respectively. The opposite was observed with the K m for the donor UDP-Gal, for which β3GalT-I showed 4- and 2-fold greaterK m values than β3GalT-II and β3GalT-III, respectively.Table IIIKinetic parameters of the three mouse β3GalT enzymesSubstrateβ3GalT-Iβ3GalT-IIβ3GalT-IIIKmVmaxKmVmaxKmVmaxmmnmol/minmmnmol/minmmnmol/minGlcNAc-β-pNP11.82.9138.30.1223.30.19UDP-Gal2.32.620.60.081.20.21 Open table in a new tab The products of the galactosyltransferase activity assays of the lysates from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells expressing β3GalT-I, -II, and -III and wild-type baculoviruses were resolved by NP-HPLC. Fig.8 A (panel i) shows the profile for the products of the β3GalT-I assay. The elution positions of UDP, UDP-Gal, GlcNAc-β-pNP, and Galβ1,3/4GlcNAc-β-pNP (peak g) were assigned by comparison with known standards (Fig. 8 A, panel ii). The HPLC fractions of the β3GalT-I, -II, and -III reaction products containing the disaccharide were pooled, evaporated to dryness, redissolved in water, and applied to the reverse phase HPLC column (Fig. 8 B, panels ii–iiii), which resolves the linkage-specific isomers Galβ1,3GlcNAc and Galβ1,4GlcNAc. The GalβGlcNAc linkage was shown to be exclusively β1,3. It was assigned by comparing the elution position of the pNP-labeled disaccharides with those of standard Galβ1,4GlcNAc-β-pNP (Fig.8 B, panel i) and standard Galβ1,3GlcNAc-β-pNP (panel v) and by co-injection with the authentic material (data not shown). The assignment was consistent with the finding that the Galβ1,3GlcNAc-β-pNP product was not susceptible toS. pneumoniae galactosidase, in contrast to Galβ1,4GlcNAc-β-pNP (data not shown). Based on the retrieval of ESTs sharing similarity with a β-galactosyltransferase gene sequence, we have identified three novel murine β3GalT genes. The identification of multiple genes encoding a β3GalT activity is consistent with recent similar findings made for other glycosyltransferase families (33Harduin-Lepers A. Recchi M.-A. Delannoy P. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 741-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The presence of several isozymes can be interpreted as a way to maintain a greater potential to glycosylate different related acceptor structures, thereby increasing the versatility of glycosyltransferases in shaping the glycoconjugate repertoire. The three β3GalT proteins are heterologous in size, with β3GalT-I and β3GalT-III representing to date the smallest mammalian glycosyltransferases after the GalNAc α2,6-sialyltransferase-III (5Sjoberg E.R. Kitagawa H. Glushka J. van Halbeek H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7450-7459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As observed for many glycosyltransferase genes, two in-frame ATG codons are present in the β3GalT-II and β3GalT-III genes. The two ATG codons are located 5′ of the region encoding the transmembrane domain, and an alternate initiation of translation would unlikely affect the localization and activity of the two proteins. The three β3GalT proteins represent a distinct family from the β1,4- and α1,3-galactosyltransferase proteins, as no sequence similarity can be detected between β3GalT enzymes and the other galactosyltransferases. This difference is emphasized by comparing the genomic organization of β3GalT genes with that of β1,4- and α1,3-galactosyltransferase genes, which contain multiple exons coding for protein sequence (14Russo R.N. Shaper N.L. Shaper J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3324-3331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Joziasse D.H. Shaper N.L. Kim D. van den Eijnden D.H. Shaper J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5534-5541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These distinctions suggest that the family of β3GalT genes separated early in evolution from the other galactosyltransferases and possibly expanded by gene duplication. It remains open as to whether the β3GalT gene family comprises additional related members. The search for ESTs similar to the three murine β3GalT sequences supports the notion of a gene family consisting of 7–10 members. The alignment of the three β3GalT protein sequences highlighted various conserved regions that were all located in the postulated catalytic domain. These β3GalT putative motifs were absent in other vertebrate galactosyltransferase protein sequences. However, a short β3GalT motif was identified in bacterial galactosyltransferases, suggesting that these amino acids are essential for galactosyltransferase activity. Some of the β3GalT motifs were also present in the Drosophila proteins Fringe and Brainiac as outlined by Yuan et al. (32Yuan Y.P. Schultz J. Mlodzik M. Bork P. Cell. 1997; 88: 9-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Fringe (34Irvine K.D. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1994; 79: 595-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and Brainiac (35Goode S. Wright D. Mahowald A.P. Development (Camb.). 1992; 116: 177-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been described as secreted signaling molecules, although their mechanism of action has not been elucidated yet. The similarity between Fringe, Brainiac, and β3GalT enzymes suggests that the twoDrosophila proteins may represent additional members of the β3GalT family. The acceptor specificity of the three β3GalT enzymes was restricted to β-conjugated GlcNAc. However, the high K m values measured for the acceptor GlcNAc-β-pNP indicate that the physiological acceptors are likely more specific oligomeric structures. The β3GalT enzymes enable the formation of type 1 carbohydrate chains, which are widely distributed on glycolipids and glycoproteins throughout tissues. Being the acceptor of the Lewis enzyme, the type 1 disaccharide Galβ1,3GlcNAc is related to the occurrence of Lea and Leb antigens (36Fenderson B.A. Eddy E.M. Hakomori S.I. Bioessays. 1990; 12: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 37Tuo X.S. Itai S. Nishikata J. Mori T. Tanaka O. Kannagi R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5744-5751PubMed Google Scholar). Although mainly expressed in brain tissue, the three β3GalT genes are differentially expressed in mouse tissues, which suggests that these three β3GalT enzymes may participate in the formation of Lea and Leb antigens in mouse tissues. The identification of three β3GalT genes highlights the structural diversity encountered in the galactosyltransferase gene family. The difference in sequence and genomic organization between β3GalT and other vertebrate galactosyltransferase genes suggests a distinct evolution. The structural information gained from the cloning of the three β3GalT genes provides a way to identify additional members of this branch of the galactosyltransferase family.

https://openalex.org/W1978216542,"Continental extension and volcanism are generally thought to be complementary. Stratigraphic and structural data from some highly extended parts of the Basin and Range province reveal instead that rapid extension appears to have suppressed volcanism. This relation may reflect enhanced crystallization of midcrustal magmas during extension resulting from exsolution of magmatic volatiles, increased interaction of magmas with meteoric water, and dispersal of magma into smaller bodies. Some rift environments may thus be characterized by voluminous synextensional plutonism with little or no concomitant volcanism."
https://openalex.org/W2038099413,Oxygen isotope compositions of epidote and quartz from chloritic breccias that underlie the detachment fault in the metamorphic core complex of the Whipple Mountains yielded quartz-epidote fractionations that range from 4.1 to 6.4 per mil and increase systematically toward the fault. These fractionations give mean temperatures that decrease from ∼432°C at 50 meters below the fault to ∼350°C at 12 meters below the fault. This extreme thermal gradient of 82°C over 38 meters (2160°C per kilometer) is best explained by advective heat extraction by means of circulating surface-derived fluids. Models of lithospheric extension consider only conductive cooling resulting from tectonic denudation and thus require revision to include fluid-induced fault-zone refrigeration.

https://openalex.org/W2326549269,"Germline mutations within the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) gene and one of its targets, the cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) gene, have been identified in a proportion of melanoma kindreds. In the case of CDK4, only one specific mutation, resulting in the substitution of a cysteine for an arginine at codon 24 (R24C), has been found to be associated with melanoma. We have previously reported the identification of germline CDKN2A mutations in 7/18 Australian melanoma kindreds and the absence of the R24C CDK4 mutation in 21 families lacking evidence of a CDKN2A mutation. The current study represents an expansion of these efforts and includes a total of 48 melanoma families from Australia. All of these families have now been screened for mutations within CDKN2A and CDK4, as well as for mutations within the CDKN2A homolog and 9p21 neighbor, the CDKN2B gene, and the alternative exon 1 (E1beta) of CDKN2A. Families lacking CDKN2A mutations, but positive for a polymorphism(s) within this gene, were further evaluated to determine if their disease was associated with transcriptional silencing of one CDKN2A allele. Overall, CDKN2A mutations were detected in 3/30 (10%) of the new kindreds. Two of these mutations have been observed previously: a 24 bp duplication at the 5' end of the gene and a G to C transversion in exon 2 resulting in an M531 substitution. A novel G to A transition in exon 2, resulting in a D108N substitution was also detected. Combined with our previous findings, we have now detected germline CDKN2A mutations in 10/48 (21%) of our melanoma kindreds. In none of the 'CDKN2A-negative' families was melanoma found to segregate with either an untranscribed CDKN2A allele, an R24C CDK4 mutation, a CDKN2B mutation, or an E1beta mutation. The last three observations suggest that these other cell cycle control genes (or alternative gene products) are either not involved at all, or to any great extent, in melanoma predisposition."

Further investigation will be needed to determine the minimal structural requirements for a molecule to be a substrate for this transporter. The rapid uptake of intact small peptides across the brush-border membrane of the small intestinal epithelium is the major route for absorption of dietary protein α-amino nitrogen (1Matthews D.M. Protein Absorption. Wiley-Liss, New York1991: 111Google Scholar). Hitherto, it has been thought that a number of chemical features, for example free amino and carboxyl termini, are essential in contributing to substrate interaction with, and translocation through, the intestinal peptide transporter. These features include the presence of a peptide bond within the substrate molecules. Indeed a major review (1Matthews D.M. Protein Absorption. Wiley-Liss, New York1991: 111Google Scholar) states that “it is the presence of peptide bonds which make di- and tripeptide acceptable to the peptide transport systems.” Although previous work (e.g. Ref. 2Daniel H. Adibi S.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) has shown that molecules lacking this feature can inhibit transport of peptides (presumably by substrate binding), we describe here for the first time rapid transport of a small totally non-peptidic substrate through the intestinal peptide transporter. The substrate, 4-aminophenylacetic acid (4-APAA), 1The abbreviations used are: 4-APAA, 4-aminophenylacetic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. was selected on the basis of its chemical structure, it being a potential mimic of a dipeptide (d-Phe-l-Ala) (Fig.1) which previously we have shown to be an excellent substrate for epithelial peptide transport (3Lister N. Sykes A.P. Bailey P.D. Boyd C.A.R. Bronk J.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484: 173-182Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4Temple C.S. Bronk J.R. Bailey P.D. Boyd C.A.R. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Rat renal brush-border membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (5Biber J. Steiger B. Haase W. Murer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and initial rates of labeled peptide transport (influx, efflux) were determined by rapid filtration (4Temple C.S.

(Lond.). 1996; 494: 795-808Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Rat intestinal loops in vitro and vascularly perfused small intestine in situ were used to measure transepithelial fluxes in the intact small intestine as described previously (3Lister N. Sykes A.P. Bailey P.D. Boyd C.A.R. Bronk J.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484: 173-182Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Nicholls T.J. Leese H.J. Bronk J.R. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Luminal pH was changed using a previously published protocol (8Lister N. Bailey P.D. Collier I.D. Boyd C.A.R. Bronk J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1324: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Isolated murine enterocytes were prepared by enzymatic digestion using haluronidase, and intracellular pH was determined fluorimetrically using carboxy-SNARF (9Buckler K.J. Vaughan-Jones R.D. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 417: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Isolated cells were exposed to 20 mm HEPES-buffered Krebs solution containing either the dipeptide (Phe-Ala) or 4-APAA. The intracellular ratiometric signal (540 nm excitation, 590 nm/640 nm emission) was calibrated after the experiments by superfusing solutions of 140 mm KCl containing 10 μm nigericin and buffered to pH 5.5, 7.5, and 9.5 with PIPES, HEPES, and CAPS, respectively. Xenopusoocyte expression of PepT1 cRNA was as described (10Fei Y.J. Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Romero M.F. Singh S.M. Boron W.F.

(Lond.). 1995; 484: 173-182Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) of transported substrate and correction for transport in water-injected controls. For efflux assays 4.6 nl (110 fmol) of radiolabeled dipeptide (d-Phe-l-Gln, 0.1 μCi/μl) was injected into each oocyte. The assay was started after the oocytes were washed, 15 min after injection. Inhibition constants (K i ) were determined as described previously (6Temple C.S. Bailey P.D. Bronk J.R. Boyd C.A.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 795-808Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly radiolabeled dipeptide influx was corrected for non-mediated transport by subtracting the transport of radiolabel seen in the presence of saturating unlabeled peptide (10 mm). The ENZFITTER program was then used to calculate theK i for mediated transport only. As part of a screening assay for potential substrates for epithelial peptide transport we used a preparation from rat renal cortex of apical brush-border membrane vesicles (5Biber J. Steiger B. Haase W. Murer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows, using this assay, that 4-APAA is capable both of cis-inhibition and trans-stimulation of labeledd-Phe-l-Glu influx and efflux, respectively. Because in the efflux assay there is no proton electrochemical gradient (the membrane being voltage-clamped using valinomycin and high K+ in both intra- and extravesicular compartments and there being no pH gradient across the membrane) the ability of 4-APAA totrans-stimulate efflux of peptide must mean that it is translocated as a substrate (12Stein W.D. Transport and Diffusion across Cell Membranes. Academic Press, New York1986: 231-361Crossref Google Scholar). Based on this initial observation, three types of experiments were performed which functionally measure transport of this molecule in relation to intestinal absorption. Using isolated rat small intestine in vitro, 4-APAA was shown using HPLC detection to be transported rapidly across the intact epithelium at a rate which was very substantially increased by external acidification (pH of lumen decreased from 7.4 to 6.8) characteristic of proton-coupled peptide transport (TableI). Moreover associated with this stimulation of transepithelial transport there was “active accumulation” of 4-APAA within the epithelium to a concentration 3.7 times greater than that in the lumen (Table I). In the intact small intestine of the rat vascularly perfused in situ there was also rapid transepithelial transport (at a rate faster than that seen for the peptide d-Phe-l-Gln); in this preparation transport of 4-APAA was inhibited significantly by concomitant addition of 10 mmd-Phe-l-Gln. Conversely, transport ofd-Phe-l-Gln was inhibited significantly by the addition of 10 mm 4-APAA (Table I).Table ITransport of peptides and 4-APAA across intact small intestinal epithelium (rat)4-Aminophenyl acetic acid (1 mm)d-Phe-l-Gln (1 mm)Transport rate (nmol/min/g dry wt) Luminal pH 7.453.2 ± 6.9218 ± 21 Luminal pH 6.8880 ± 83314 ± 16Tissue accumulation (mm) Luminal pH 7.40.24 ± 0.165.7 ± 0.41 Luminal pH 6.83.70 ± 0.134.5 ± 0.35Vascular appearance rateControl329 ± 20253 ± 4.5 + 4-APAA (10 mm)136 ± 2.3 +d-Phe-l-Gln (10 mm)165 ± 10 Open table in a new tab When isolated intestinal enterocytes were superfused with a solution containing Phe-Ala the peptide caused intracellular acidification (as expected for a substrate for a proton-coupled transporter (10Fei Y.J.

Hediger M.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar)) (Fig.3); applied separately, the isostere 4-APAA (2 mm) had the same effect. However in the presence of a maximal concentration of peptide (20 mm), 4-APAA was unable to produce further intracellular acidification; similarly in the presence of a high concentration of 4-APAA (20 mm), the initial rate and extent of intracellular acidification in response to the peptide was markedly reduced. These findings strongly suggest that the peptide and 4-APAA share the same route for influx and that this pathway is proton-coupled. (Note that at high concentrations 4-APAA acted as a weak acid (13Loh S.-H. Sun B. Vaughan-Jones R.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1905-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) producing transient intracellular acidification and alkalinization following, respectively, its addition to and removal from the superfusate.) Fig. 4 directly confirms that 4-APAA is a substrate for the intestinal peptide transporter PepT1 when this protein is expressed in Xenopus oocytes. This figure shows that 4-APAA (measured by HPLC) is transported into PepT1-expressing oocytes, that 4-APAA inhibits peptide (d-Phe-l-Gln) uptake into PepT1-expressing oocytes, and that radiolabeled peptide (d-Phe-l-Gln) efflux from PepT1-expressing (but not from water-injected control) oocytes is trans-stimulated by 4-APAA as well as by peptide. The results from these transport assays demonstrate unambiguously that the presence of a peptide bond is not necessary for the rapid translocation of a substrate through the intestinal peptide transporter (PepT1). Our study leaves open the question as to the minimum requirements for a molecule to be a substrate. In the case of 4-APAA the fact that this molecule has both amino- and carboxyl-terminals separated by 5 carbon atoms as well as being planar (through its possession of an aromatic ring) may be pertinent. Nevertheless the findings reported here offer scope for chemical design of drugs which, despite lacking a peptide bond, will be absorbed rapidly from the small intestine via this transporter. We are grateful to M. A. Hediger for the PepT1 clone."
https://openalex.org/W2046084460,"Several observations indicate that the Raf-1 kinase is a downstream effector of protein kinase C-ε (PKCε). We recently have shown that Raf-1 is constitutively activated in PKCε transformed Rat6 fibroblasts, and transformation can be reverted by expression of a dominant negative Raf-1, but not a dominant negative Ras mutant (Cacace et al., 1996). Cai et al. (1997) demonstrated that PKCε induced proliferation of NIH3T3 cells is independent of Ras or Src, but depends on Raf-1. These authors further suggested that PKCε activates Raf-1 by direct phosphorylation. Here we have investigated the functional interaction between PKCε and Raf-1. PKCε, but not PKCα, was found to bind to the Raf-1 kinase domain. The association appeared to be direct, as it could be reconstituted in vitro with purified proteins. Raf-1 and PKCε could be co-precipitated from Sf-9 insect cells and PKCε transformed NIH313 cells (NIH/ε). The association was negatively regulated by ATP in vitro and by TPA treatment in NIH/ε cells, but not in Sf-9 insect cells. Raf-1 was constitutively activated in NIH/ε cells. However, using coexpression experiments in Sf-9 cells and transiently transfected A293 cells we did not obtain any evidence for a direct activation of Raf-1 by PKCε. PKCε did not induce translocation of Raf-1 to the membrane. Furthermore, PKCε did not activate Raf-1 nor enhance the kinase activity of Raf-1 that had been pre-activated by coexpression of Ras or the Lck tyrosine kinase. In contrast, conditioned media from PKCε transformed cells induced a robust activation of Raf-1. This activation could be partially reproduced by recombinant TGFβ, a growth factors secreted by PKCε transformed Rat6 cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that PKCε stimulates Raf-1 indirectly by inducing the production of autocrine growth factors."

The ERMYB-transformed hemopoietic cells exhibit an immature myeloid phenotype when grown in the presence of β-estradiol. Upon removal of β-estradiol, the ERMYB cells display increased adherence, decreased clonogenicity and differentiate to cells exhibiting granulocyte or macrophage morphology. The expression of the c-myc, c-kit, cdc2 and bcl-2 genes, which are putatively regulated by Myb, was investigated in ERMYB cells grown in the presence or absence of β-estradiol. Neither c-myc nor cdc2 expression was down-regulated after removal of β-estradiol demonstrating that differentiation is not a consequence of decreased transactivation of these genes by ERMYB. While bcl-2 expression was reduced by 50% in ERMYB cells grown in the absence of β-estradiol, there was no increase in DNA laddering, suggesting that Myb was not protecting ERMYB cells from apoptosis. In contrast, a substantial (200-fold) decrease in c-kit mRNA level was observed following differentiation of ERMYB cells, and c-kit mRNA could be partially re-induced by the re-addition of β-estradiol. Furthermore, a reporter construct containing the c-kit promoter was activated when cotransfected with a Myb expression vector, providing further evidence of a role for Myb in the regulation of c-kit."
https://openalex.org/W2313522156,"Ral GDP dissociation stimulator (RalGDS), a putative effector protein of Ras, stimulated the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of the post-tanslationally lipid-modified but not the unmodified form of Ral in response to epidermal growth factor in COS cells. The RalGDS action on Ral was enhanced by an active form of Ras but not a Ras mutant which was not post-translationally modified in the cells. The RalGDS activity was inhibited by acidic membrane phospholipids such as phosphatidyl-inositol and phosphatidylserine but not by phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine in vitro. The post-translationally modified form but not unmodified form of Ras, Ral, and Rap were incorporated in liposomes consisting of these phospholipids. When Ral was incorporated alone in the liposomes, RalGDS did not stimulate the dissociation of GDP from Ral. When Ral was incorporated with the GTP-bound form of Ras in the liposomes, RalGDS stimulated the dissociation of GDP from Ral, while the GDP-bound form of Ras did not affect the RalGDS action. The Ras-dependent Ral activation through RalGDS required the Ras-binding domain of RalGDS. Rap, which shared the same effector loop as Ras, also stimulated the dissociation of GDP from Ral through RalGDS in the liposomes, although Rap did not enhance the RalGDS action in COS cells. Taken together with our previous observations that Ras recruits RalGDS to the membrane, these results indicate that the post-translational modifications of Ras and Ral are important for Ras-dependent Ral activation through RalGDS and that colocalization of Ras and Ral on the membrane is necessary for Ral activation in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1975687767,"Biological effects of many hormones and cytokines are mediated through receptor-associated Jak tyrosine kinases and cytoplasmic Stat transcription factors, including critical physiological processes such as immunity, reproduction, and cell growth and differentiation. Pharmaceuticals that control Jak-Stat pathways are therefore of considerable interest. Here we demonstrate that a single Jak-Stat pathway can be activated by aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), a negatively charged triphenylmethane derivative (475 Da) with anti-apoptotic properties. In prolactin (PRL)-dependent Nb2 lymphocytes, ATA sustained cell growth in the absence of hormone and mimicked rapid PRL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and activation of Stat5a and Stat5b with tyrosine phosphorylation, heterodimerization, DNA binding, and induction of the Stat5-regulatedpim-1 protooncogene. ATA also mimicked PRL activation of serine kinases ERK1 and ERK2. However, unlike PRL, ATA did not regulate Stat1 or Stat3. ATA also did not affect Jak3, which is activated in these cells by interleukin-2 family cytokines. Although the mechanism and specificity by which ATA activates Jak2, Stat5, and ERKs in Nb2 cells are still unclear, the present study demonstrates that certain hormone or cytokine effects on Jak-Stat pathways can be discretely imitated by a low molecular weight, non-peptide pharmaceutical.

In prolactin (PRL)-dependent Nb2 lymphocytes, ATA sustained cell growth in the absence of hormone and mimicked rapid PRL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and activation of Stat5a and Stat5b with tyrosine phosphorylation, heterodimerization, DNA binding, and induction of the Stat5-regulatedpim-1 protooncogene. ATA also mimicked PRL activation of serine kinases ERK1 and ERK2. However, unlike PRL, ATA did not regulate Stat1 or Stat3. ATA also did not affect Jak3, which is activated in these cells by interleukin-2 family cytokines. Although the mechanism and specificity by which ATA activates Jak2, Stat5, and ERKs in Nb2 cells are still unclear, the present study demonstrates that certain hormone or cytokine effects on Jak-Stat pathways can be discretely imitated by a low molecular weight, non-peptide pharmaceutical. The results are also consistent with Stat5 involvement in lymphocyte growth and survival. Janus tyrosine kinases (Jaks) and cytoplasmic signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats) are critical mediators for key biological effects of a number of polypeptide hormones and cytokines (1Ihle J.N.

The regulatory functions of Jak-Stat signal pathways are still being widely investigated, and their pharmacological control is of significant clinical interest. In humans, genetic inactivation of Jak3 is associated with a severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome due to disruption of signals by many lymphocyte growth factors using the common interleukin-2 (IL2) 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; PRL, prolactin; ATA, aurintricarboxylic acid; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; kb, kilobase; EGF, epidermal growth factor. receptor-γ (3Macchi P.

Recently, progress has been made with generating selective Jak2 inhibitors (6Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar), and efforts to develop specific Jak3 inhibitors for use as immunosuppressive agents are ongoing. Conceptually, selective pharmacological activators of Jaks and Stats also have important therapeutic potential. Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) is a polyanionic aromatic compound with reported anti-apoptotic effects in several cell types, including Nb2 lymphocytes (7Okada N. Koizumi S. J. Biol.

Cytokine. 1995; 7: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We now report that ATA treatment of Nb2 lymphocytes leads to rapid activation of Jak2 but not of other Jaks. ATA-induced Jak2 activation was associated with activation of transcription factors Stat5a and Stat5b in addition to serine kinases ERK1/2. However, unlike prolactin, ATA did not induce additional Stat1 and Stat3 signals. The present study describes activation of a Jak2-Stat5 pathway by ATA in Nb2 cells and suggests a novel pharmaceutical approach involving low molecular weight, non-peptide compounds to activate individual Jak-Stat pathways. Ovine PRL (NIDDK-oPRL-19, AFP-9221A) was supplied by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIDDK, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 and polyclonal rabbit antisera to Jak1, Jak2, Tyk2, and Jak3 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (catalog numbers 06-321, 06-272, 06-255, 06-375, and 06-342, respectively). Polyclonal rabbit antisera specific to peptides corresponding to the unique COOH termini of Stat1α, Stat2, Stat3, Stat5a, and Stat5b were generated as described previously (13Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Xu J. Liu X. Farrar W.L. Hennighausen L. Larner A.C. Grimley P.M. Rui H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14098-15003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies for immunoblotting of Stat1 and Stat3 were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (catalog numbers S21120 and S21320, respectively). Rabbit antibodies to active MAPK were purchased from Promega (catalog number V667A), and a mouse monoclonal anti-panERK antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (catalog number E17120/L3). PRL-dependent Nb2 cells were originally developed by Dr. Peter Gout (14Gout P.W. Beer C.T. Noble R.L. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 2433-2436PubMed Google Scholar); the Nb2-SP clone also used in this work was provided by Dr. Henry Friesen (University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, catalog number 15-040-LM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Intergen, catalog number 1020-90), 2 mml-glutamine, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and penicillin-streptomycin (50 IU/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Nb2 cells at a density of 1–1.5 × 106/ml were incubated for 20–24 h in lactogen-free RPMI 1640 medium, which instead of 10% fetal calf serum contained 1% gelded horse serum (Sigma, catalog number H-1895). Serum-deprived cells were dispensed into 96-well microtiter plates at 4 × 104cells/100 μl and exposed to control medium, oPRL, or ATA as indicated for 48 h. Viable cells were measured metabolically by the Promega cell proliferation assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) as described previously (15Da Silva L. Howard O.M. Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18267-18270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Colorimetric analysis was performed using a semiautomatic plate reader from Dynatech Laboratories (MR600) at absorbance 570 nm. DNA extracts were prepared from samples of 5 × 106 cells as described (16Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1216-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), treated with RNase (25 μg/ml), and separated by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) and photographed using a UV transilluminator (Fotodyne Inc.). Frozen pellets from 1 × 108 Nb2 cells were thawed on ice and solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell lysates were rotated at 4 °C for 60 min, and insoluble material was pelleted at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Clarified lysates were incubated rotating end over end for 3 h at 4 °C with polyclonal rabbit antisera (2 μl/ml) to individual Jak and Stat proteins as specified. Antibodies were captured by incubation for 60 min with protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., catalog number 17-0780-01), and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described previously (17Rui H. Djeu J.Y. Evans G.A. Kelly P.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24076-24081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, catalog number 1PVH 00010) and horseradish-conjugated secondary antibodies in conjunction with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate mixture (Amersham, catalog number RPN2106) and x-ray film. Quiescent Nb2 cells were stimulated with oPRL (100 nm) for 0–60 min at 37 °C and lysed at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmEGTA, 40 mm, α-glycerophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were incubated with 2 μg of monoclonal MAPK antibody 12CA5 (Babco, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered using protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). After washing of immunoprecipitates three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm vanadate, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5 m LiCl, 20 μl of kinase buffer was added (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm α-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mmMgC12, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate). The MAPK activity was analyzed by adding 30 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (20 Ci/mmol), 20 μm unlabeled ATP, and 1 μg of myelin basic protein/reaction as a substrate. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by addition of 6 μl of 4 × sample buffer. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Quiescent Nb2 cells were treated with or without PRL (10 nm) for 10 min, pelleted by centrifugation and immediately solubilized in EMSA lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm orthovanadate, 25 mm NaF, 200 μm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min and then clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. For the EMSA, 1 ng of oligonucleotide corresponding to the PRL response element (5′-agcatgtttcaaggatttgagatgtatttcccagaaaag-3′) of the rat β-casein gene that had been end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP was incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 μg of protein from cellular lysates in a total of 40 μl of binding mixture (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) at room temperature for 20 min, with preincubation of samples with 1 μl of either normal rabbit serum or antisera specific to Stat transcription factors as indicated. Polyacrylamide gels (5%) containing 5% glycerol and 0.25 × TBE (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) were prerun in 0.25 × TBE buffer at 4–10 °C for 1.5 h at 270 V. Gels were run at room temperature for approximately 3 h at 250 V, dried by heating under vacuum, and exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat, Kodak). Nb2 cells treated with PRL or ATA were lysed using Trizol (Ambion) and processed as described previously (15Da Silva L. Howard O.M. Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18267-18270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For hybridization a 2.7-kb insert containing a full-length humanpim-1 cDNA cloned into the NotI site of pRBK was used (provided by Dr. Nancy Magnuson, Washington State University, Pullman, WA). The biological activity of ATA on Nb2 cells was tested using assays for proliferation and DNA fragmentation (Fig.1). Exponentially growing, PRL-dependent Nb2 cells were serum-deprived for 24 h in PRL-free medium containing 1% horse serum and cultured with varying concentrations of ATA and varying concentrations of PRL for another 48 h. Cell growth was assayed using the MTT method as described. ATA alone stimulated Nb2 cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching peak levels at 100 μm, whereas PRL-induced cell growth leveled off at 16 pm (Fig. 1 A). In combination, submaximal concentrations of ATA and PRL exerted additive effects on cell proliferation, but there was no synergy or additive effect at saturating concentrations, suggesting that the two agents may activate shared effector mechanisms. ATA also stimulated proliferation of a PRL-independent Nb2-SP cell line, which is a derivative clone with an elevated constitutive proliferation rate (18Walker A. Croze F. Friesen H.G. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 2389-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Probably due to this higher proliferation rate, the effect of ATA on Nb2-SP cell growth was modest, averaging 1.6-fold of basal growth rate (p < 0.001, n = 3; data not shown). However, as presented in Fig. 1 B, ATA significantly counteracted DNA fragmentation in Nb2-SP cells induced by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (Fig. 1 B, lanes a–d). PRL was less efficient in preventing staurosporine-induced DNA fragmentation in these cells (Fig.1 B, lane e). From these studies of Nb2 cell biology, we conclude that ATA has marked positive effects on the growth and survival of Nb2 lymphoma cells. We have previously shown that PRL specifically activates Jak2 in Nb2 cells, whereas several other lymphocyte growth factors activate Jak3 via the common IL2-receptor-γ in these cells (11Kirken R.A. Rui H. Malabarba M.G. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19136-19141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kirken R.A. Rui H. Malabarba M.G. Howard O.M. Kawamura M. O'Shea J.J. Farrar W.L. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of ATA on Jak kinases in Nb2 cells. Quiescent Nb2 cells were treated with or without ATA (250 μm) for 10 min. Individual Jaks were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig.2 A, upper row). Jak2 showed a robust tyrosine phosphorylation response to ATA, whereas no activation of Jak1, Jak3, or Tyk2 was observed. Of these latter protein kinases, Jak3 is expressed at levels comparable with those of Jak2 as judged from immunoblots (Fig. 2 A, lower row) and was markedly activated in Nb2 cells by IL2, IL7, and IL9 (Refs. 11Kirken R.A. Rui H. Malabarba M.G. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19136-19141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 12Kirken R.A. Rui H. Malabarba M.G. Howard O.M. Kawamura M. O'Shea J.J. Farrar W.L. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar; data not shown). Jak1 and Tyk2 were also not activated by ATA, but the degree of specificity should be interpreted with caution because Jak1 is expressed only at lower levels and Tyk2 is not readily detectable in Nb2 cells (Fig. 2 A, lower row). However, ATA-induced activation of Jak2 in Nb2 cells was rapid. Kinetic analysis showed that peak Jak2 phosphorylation levels were reached within 4 min of stimulation and remained detectable for at least 60 min (Fig. 2 B). Additional analyses (not shown) revealed that inducible Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation could be detected within 1 min of ATA exposure, suggesting that Jak2 is an initial mediator of ATA effects. Having established that ATA stimulates Jak2 in Nb2 cells, we examined the effect of ATA on Stat transcription factors, which are substrates of Jak tyrosine kinases (1Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 2Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Whereas PRL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5a/b (Ref. 13Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Xu J. Liu X. Farrar W.L. Hennighausen L. Larner A.C. Grimley P.M. Rui H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14098-15003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar; data not shown), treatment of Nb2 cells with ATA induced rapid and robust tyrosine phosphorylation only of Stat5a and Stat5b (Fig.3, first, third,sixth, and eighth panels), reaching maximum levels within 8–15 min of ATA stimulation. Reblotting of the samples with corresponding Stat antibodies verified equal levels of Stat loaded per lane (second, fourth, seventh, and ninth panels). Similar to previous observations with PRL-induced Stat5 activation (13Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Xu J. Liu X. Farrar W.L. Hennighausen L. Larner A.C. Grimley P.M. Rui H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14098-15003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), ATA treatment led to a partial mobility retardation of Stat5b but not Stat5a (see fourth panel). Furthermore, ATA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a and Stat5b was associated with heterodimerization of the two Stat5 proteins, as demonstrated by inducible coimmunoprecipitation of Stat5a and Stat5b (fifth panel). Within 4 min of stimulation, Stat5a was detectable in anti-Stat5b immunoprecipitates. This also corresponds to PRL-induced Stat5a/b heterodimerization in Nb2 cells (13Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Xu J. Liu X. Farrar W.L. Hennighausen L. Larner A.C. Grimley P.M. Rui H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14098-15003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We conclude that ATA causes tyrosine phosphorylation and heterodimerization of Stat5a and Stat5b but does not mimic the additional Stat1 and Stat3 responses induced by PRL in Nb2 cells. We and others have previously shown that PRL activates Jak2, the SHC-Ras pathway, and MAPK in Nb2 cells (19Erwin R.A. Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Farrar W.L. Rui H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3512-3518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Buckley A.R. Rao Y.P. Buckley D.J. Gout P.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1158-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Carey G.B. Liberti J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Treatment of Nb2 lymphocytes with ATA also was associated with a rapid activation of MAP kinase ERK2 and to a lesser extent with activation of ERK1 (Fig.4 A). Protein from lysates of cells that had been treated with ATA (250 μm) for varying times up to 60 min were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies to the active forms of ERK1/2 (Fig. 4 A, top panel). MAPK activation was detectable within 4 min of exposure to ATA and culminated at 15 min. Reblotting of the same samples with an anti-pan ERK antibody verified equal loading and established that ERK2 is the predominantly expressed form of these two ERKs in Nb2 cells (Fig. 4 A, middle panel). Parallel analysis of the enzymatic activity of MAPK was performed using immunoprecipitation of MAPK followed by an in vitro kinase assay with myelin basic protein as a substrate. The bottom panel of Fig.4 A shows that MAPK enzyme activity corresponded to that observed with anti-phosphoMAPK antibodies, reaching maximum levels at 15 min, followed by a reduction toward base-line levels at 60 min. Furthermore, we demonstrated that both ATA-induced Stat5a/b and MAPK activation were concentration-dependent, with EC50 values of approximately 100–150 μm for both responses (Fig. 4 B). Full biochemical responses by Stat5a/b and ERKs were achieved at 250 μm of ATA, using a 10-min stimulation period. A similar ATA concentration dependence also was observed for Jak2 (data not shown). We conclude that in Nb2 cells, ATA activates MAPK in addition to Jak2-Stat5 in a concentration-dependent manner. A recent study reported that ATA protected against apoptosis and stimulated MAPK in PC12 neuroma cells but not in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (7Okada N. Koizumi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16464-16469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It may therefore be of interest to determine whether the Jak2-Stat5 pathway is concurrently activated in PC12 cells. To establish whether ATA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and heterodimerization of Stat5a/b were associated with increased DNA binding, we analyzed the ability of Stat5 proteins to interact with the γ-activated site of the PRL response element of the β-casein gene promoter. Lysates of unstimulated Nb2 cells or cells treated with either ATA (250 μm) or PRL (10 nm) for 10 min were analyzed for binding to a 32P-labeled γ-activated site probe. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that ATA induced the formation of a single complex (Fig.5 A, lanes a and b) that could be completely supershifted with a mixture of Stat5a and Stat5b antisera (lane g) and partially supershifted by antiserum to either Stat5 isoform (lanes eand f). This Stat5a/b complex could not be supershifted by antibodies to Stat1 or Stat3 (lanes c and d), consistent with an exclusive Stat5a/b activation by ATA. Furthermore, the ATA-induced Stat5a/b complex comigrated with a PRL-induced Stat5a/b complex (lane h), which also was completely supershifted with antibodies to Stat5a and Stat5b (lane k). In addition, PRL induced the formation of a faster migrating Stat1 complex (lane h), which could be supershifted with anti-Stat1 serum (lane i) but not with Stat3 or Stat5 antiserum (lanes j and k). Stat2 also was not affected by ATA (data not shown). Thus, the coordinated tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activities of Stat5a and Stat5b were specifically induced by ATA. To examine whether ATA-stimulated Stat5 is functionally active, we tested the ability of ATA to induce mRNA levels of the protein kinasepim-1. This is a known Stat5-regulated gene in hematopoietic cells (22Muli A.L. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and it is activated accordingly by interleukin-2 and prolactin in Nb2 cells (23Buckley A.R. Buckley D.J. Leff M.A. Hoover D.S. Magnuson N.S. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5252-5259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nb2 cells were incubated in medium containing 1% horse serum for 24 h and treated with PRL (10 nm) or ATA (100 μm) and analyzed forpim-1 mRNA expression over a 4-h period. In agreement with previous work (23Buckley A.R. Buckley D.J. Leff M.A. Hoover D.S. Magnuson N.S. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5252-5259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PRL induced a rapid induction ofpim-1 mRNA, detectable within 30 min and with peak levels at 1 h (Fig. 5 B). ATA also stimulatedpim-1 with similar rapid kinetics, although ATA-induced mRNA levels stayed elevated also at 4 h. At 30 min, both PRL and ATA induced the appearance of a transcript slightly larger than the principal 2.8-kb pim-1 mRNA. This larger species may represent nuclear precursor mRNA, because only a 2.8-kb transcript has been observed in somatic cells (24Wingett D. Reeves R. Magnuson N.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3183-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the observed ATA induction of pim-1 mRNA levels provides evidence for functional activity of ATA-stimulated Stat5. We have demonstrated that a non-peptide agent, ATA, is capable of activating a single Jak-Stat pathway (Jak2-Stat5) in addition to stimulating the serine kinases ERK1/2 in Nb2 lymphoma cells. Based upon the presently observed temporal relationship between ATA-induced Jak2, Stat5, and MAPK activation, as well as upon current models of Jak-mediated signal transduction (25Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 26Winston L.A. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30837-30840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), activation of Jak2 is probably the most upstream of these events. ATA is a polycarboxylated triphenylmethane derivative with a molecular mass of 473 Da that can polymerize into larger complexes of up to 6,000 Da (27Guo Z. Weinstein M.J. Phillips M.D. Kroll M.H. Thromb. Res. 1993; 71: 77-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because ATA was found not to permeate the intact cell membrane (28Apirion D. Dohner D. Corcoran J.W. Hahn F.E. Antibiotics. III. Springer-Verlag, New York1975: 327-340Google Scholar), it is presumably activating Jak2 via transmembrane proteins. One possibility is that particular cell surface proteins may be aggregated by ATA to induce the intracellular changes in Jak2 and Stat5 activation. The most likely candidate membrane-spanning proteins are hormone and cytokine receptors known to activate of Jak-Stat pathways upon oligomerization, such as PRL receptors (29Rui H. Lebrun J.J. Kirken R.A. Kelly P.A. Farrar W.L. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ATA does mimic PRL-induced growth of Nb2 cells, and like PRL (9Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5364-5368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30DaSilva L. Rui H. Erwin R.A. Howard O.M. Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Hackett R.H. Larner A.C. Farrar W.L. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1996; 117: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), ATA activates Jak2 and not other Jaks in Nb2 cells. Furthermore, consistent with a shared mechanism of action, when given together at maximally effective concentrations, ATA and PRL do not act synergistically or additively on cell growth, whereas their effects are additive at submaximal concentrations. On the other hand, ATA exclusively induced Stat5a/b-DNA complexes and, unlike PRL, did not also stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3. Furthermore, we have been unable to detect any ATA-induced Jak or Stat activation in human mammary T47D cells (data not shown), which express high levels of PRL receptors and display PRL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5 (30DaSilva L. Rui H. Erwin R.A. Howard O.M. Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Hackett R.H. Larner A.C. Farrar W.L. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1996; 117: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). 2H. Rui, R. A. Kirken, M. G. Malabarba, R. A. Erwin, J. D. Schaber, R. J. Duhe, A. C. Larner, and W. L. Farrar, submitted for publication. Preliminary efforts also did not indicate that ATA mimics PRL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the PRL receptors in Nb2 cells (data not shown). Finally, additional experiments suggest that PRL receptors may not be a prerequisite, because ATA was able to induce Stat5 phosphorylation in the mouse 32D leukocyte line (data not shown), which does not express PRL receptors (15Da Silva L. Howard O.M. Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18267-18270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to membrane proteins of the cytokine receptor family, some growth factor receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity can activate Jak-Stat pathways. For example, EGF activated Jak1 and Stat1 and Stat3 in fibroblasts (31Leaman D.W. Pisharody S. Flickinger T.W. Commane M.A. Schlessinger J. Kerr I.M. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Very recently, ATA treatment of the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line was reported to cause tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB4, a protein of the EGF receptor family (32Okada N. Koizumi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility cannot be excluded that receptors of the EGF family are involved in transmembrane signaling by ATA in Nb2 cells. However, regardless of the mechanism, the observed discriminate activation by ATA of a Jak2-Stat5 pathway suggests an unexpected potential for pharmaceutical targeting of particular Jak-Stat pathways. In conclusion, this study presents novel evidence for discriminate pharmacological activation of a single Jak2-Stat5 pathway, an effect that was associated with survival and sustained growth of Nb2 lymphocytes. Jak2 activation was associated with a robust activation of Stat5a and Stat5b as measured by tyrosine phosphorylation, heterodimerization, and DNA binding. ATA also induced mRNA levels of the Stat5-regulated pim-1 protooncogene. The present study demonstrates that certain hormone or cytokine effects on Jak-Stat pathways may be discretely imitated by non-peptide pharmaceuticals. The results are also consistent with a proposed role for Stat5 in lymphocyte growth and survival (22Muli A.L. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and consistent with the fact that Jak2 is a direct upstream activator of Stat5a and Stat5b. Future studies are directed at validating biological applications of ATA and will explore the molecular mechanism of ATA-induced Jak2-Stat5 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2315691080,"From the sequences of Rel/NF-κB and IκB proteins, we constructed an alignment of their Rel Homology Domain (RHD) and ankyrin repeat domain. Using this alignment, we performed tree reconstruction with both distance matrix and parsimony analysis and estimated the branching robustness using bootstrap resampling methods. We defined four subfamilies of Rel/NF-κB transcription factors: (i) cRel, RelA, RelB, Dorsal and Dif; (ii) NF-κB1 and NF-κB2; (iii) Relish and (iv) NF-AT factors, the most divergent members. Subfamilies I and II are clustered together whereas Relish diverged earlier than other Rel/NF-κB proteins. Three subfamilies of IκB inhibitors were also defined: (i) NF-κB1 and NF-κB2; (ii) close to subfamily I, the short IκB proteins IκBα, IκBβ and Bcl-3; (iii) Relish that diverged earlier than other IκB inhibitors. Our definition of groups and subfamilies fits to structural and functional features of the Rel/NF-κB and IκB proteins. We also showed that ankyrin repeats of NF-κB1, NF-κB2 and Relish are short IκB-specific ankyrin motifs. These proteins defining a link between Rel/NF-κB and IκB families, we propose that all these factors evolved from a common ancestral RHD-ankyrin structure within a unique superfamily, explaining the specificities of interaction between the different Rel/NF-κB dimers and the various IκB inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2329058421,"The 120 kD product of the c-Cbl oncogene is a prominent substrate of protein tyrosine kinases that lacks a known catalytic activity but possesses an array of binding sites for cytoplasmic signalling proteins. An oncogenic form of Cbl was recently identified in the 70Z/3 pre-B cell lymphoma which has a small deletion at the N-terminus of the Ring finger domain. This form of Cbl, termed 70Z-Cbl, exhibits an enhanced level of tyrosine phosphorylation compared with c-Cbl. Here we demonstrate that the expression of 70Z-Cbl induces a tenfold enhancement in the kinase activity of the EGF receptor in serum-starved and EGF-stimulated cells. In serum-starved cells this results in EGF receptor autophosphorylation and the recruitment of Grb2, Shc and Sos1 but does not induce a corresponding increase in MAP kinase activity. Furthermore the expression of 70Z-Cbl greatly enhances EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. We also show that the Cbl/EGF receptor complex is predominantly associated with CrkII and is distinct to the Grb2/Shc/Sos1 complex that associates with the EGF receptor. These findings therefore demonstrate a biochemical effect of an oncogenic Cbl protein and support predictions from C. elegans that Cbl functions as regulator of receptor tyrosine kinases."

The residues aspartic acid-88 and histidine-210, implicated in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme (Savva, R., McAuley-Hecht, K., Brown, T., and Pearl, L. (1995) Nature 373, 487–493; Slupphaug, G., Mol, C. D., Kavli, B., Arvai, A. S., Krokan, H. E. and Tainer, J. A. (1996) Nature 384, 87–92) were separately mutated to asparagine to allow investigations of substrate recognition in the absence of catalysis. The mutants were shown to be correctly folded and to lack catalytic activity. Binding to single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides, with or without uracil, was monitored by real-time biomolecular interaction analysis using surface plasmon resonance. Both mutants exhibited comparable rates of binding and dissociation on the same uracil-containing substrates. Interaction with single-stranded uracil-DNA was found to be stronger than with double-stranded uracil-DNA, and the binding to Gua:Ura mismatches was significantly stronger than that to Ade:Ura base pairs suggesting that the stability of the base pair determines the efficiency of interaction. Also, there was negligible interaction between the mutants and single- or double-stranded DNA lacking uracil, or with DNA containing abasic sites. These results suggest that it is uracil in the DNA, rather than DNA itself, that is recognized by the uracil-DNA glycosylases. Site-directed mutants of the herpes simplex virus type 1 uracil-DNA glycosylase lacking catalytic activity have been used to probe the substrate recognition of this highly conserved and ubiquitous class of DNA-repair enzyme utilizing surface plasmon resonance.

These results suggest that it is uracil in the DNA, rather than DNA itself, that is recognized by the uracil-DNA glycosylases. Uracil-DNA glycosylases (UDG) 1The abbreviations used are: UDG, uracil-DNA glycosylase; HSV1, herpes simplex virus type 1; ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded; Ugi, uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor; RU, resonance units; E+DNA(U), enzyme in the presence of uracil-DNA; E:DNA(U), enzyme in complex with uracil-DNA; E:U(DNA), enzyme in complex with a DNA-uracil. are a highly conserved and ubiquitous class of DNA-repair enzymes that catalyze the excision of uracil bases from DNA (1Mosbaugh D.W. Rev. Biochem. Tox. 1988; 9: 69-130Google Scholar). Uracil is an RNA base and does not normally occur in DNA, though it forms a good Watson-Crick base pair with adenine. Uracil and thymine differ in that thymine is methylated at the 5-position of the pyrimidine ring, and this is not involved in forming the base pair. Uracil can occur in DNA either by misincorporation of deoxyuridine triphosphate during replication by DNA polymerases, which apparently do not discriminate between this nucleotide and thymidine triphosphate, or as the product of spontaneous hydrolytic deamination of cytosine residues in DNA (1Mosbaugh D.W. Rev. Biochem. Tox. 1988; 9: 69-130Google Scholar, 2Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar). The Gua:Ura mismatches that result from cytosine deamination are promutagenic, leading to Gua:Cyt → Ade:Thy transition mutations unless the uracil is repaired to the original cytosine (1Mosbaugh D.W. Rev. Biochem. Tox. 1988; 9: 69-130Google Scholar, 2Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar). As thymine methyls in Ade:Thy base pairs are essential in sequence-specific recognition by many regulatory DNA-binding proteins (3Focher F. Verri A. Verzeletti S. Mazzarello P. Spadari S. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1992; 102: S67-S71Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), Ade:Ura base pairs, although not mutagenic, are potentially disruptive. Recently, the structural basis for the exquisite recognition of uracil by UDGs has been elucidated (4Savva R. McAuley-Hecht K. Brown T. Pearl L. Nature. 1995; 373: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 5Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Slupphaug G. Kavli B. Alseth I. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A.

Nature. 1996; 384: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The structures show that these enzymes are able to accomodate sequence nonspecific DNA along a channel and that this channel contains an active site pocket that is perfectly tailored to admit only uracil bases. The evidence for a DNA-binding channel is further supported by the structures of a specific peptide inhibitor of the UDGs in complex with the enzymes. This inhibitor prevents binding of UDG to DNA, and is seen to mimic a polynucleotide in its interaction with the enzyme (7Savva R. Pearl L.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 752-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Sanderson R.J. Slupphaug G. Kavli B. Krokan H.E. Mosbaugh D.W. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 701-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The structures of DNA modification and repair enzymes in complex with polynucleotides either show directly, or indicate the likelihood of, the extrusion of the target base from the DNA duplex (6Slupphaug G. Mol C.D. Kavli B. Arvai A.S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 9Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X.D.

Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In the case of the UDGs, there is no apparent facility for a gross conformational change in the enzyme, and the only way that uracil can enter into the specific pocket is for the base to become extrahelical. This has recently been shown structurally for UDG (6Slupphaug G. Mol C.D. Kavli B. Arvai A.S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The phenomenon of “base-flipping” has yet to be experimentally deconvoluted from the reaction as a whole, and it is still open to debate as to whether the extrusion of DNA bases from a duplex is spontaneous or is actively promoted by the DNA modification or repair enzymes (12Roberts R.J. Cell. 1995; 82: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Structural analysis alone is unable to distinguish the two possible mechanisms. Mutation of active site residues to yield catalytically inactive mutant proteins coupled with careful binding studies may well yield a satisfactory answer to this question; it is with this question in mind that these studies were undertaken. Both of the residues implicated in catalysis by structural studies, aspartic acid-88 and histidine-210, were mutated to asparagine and used in binding studies to a range of oligonucleotides using surface plasmon resonance. This system is a powerful means of attempting to deconvolute the mode of substrate recognition and binding by UDG in the absence of catalysis. Aspartic acid-88 and histidine-210 of the recombinant HSV1 UDG were both mutated to asparagine (D88N and H210N, respectively) to abolish catalytic activity. Oligonucleotide 18-mers were designed to change the codons in the open reading frame from aspartic acid and histidine, respectively, to asparagine with the substitution of just one nucleotide in each case. The oligonucleotides were designed such that the mismatch was located in the middle of the sequence. The method used for mutagenesis was the Altered Sites II system (Promega) and was followed as per protocol. The mutagenesis was effected by subcloning the HSV1 UDG open reading frame from the original expression vector pTS106· (13Savva R. Pearl L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 910-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) using NcoI and filling the overhang with Klenow purification of DNA by Geneclean (Anachem) and final excision of the open reading frame using HindIII, and inserting it into the mutagenesis vector supplied with the kit (pALTER1) intoSmaI and HindIII, thus recreating theNcoI site for subsequent recloning into pTrc99A following mutagenesis. Unique restriction sites were introduced by mutagenesis (EcoO109I for D88N, and BstBI for H210N), and these were used to screen for positive mutant DNAs. Positively identified mutants were cloned as NcoI to HindIII fragments in pTrc99A (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) cut with the same enzymes. Expression was performed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), and standard assays were carried out for UDG activity (14Koulis A. Cowan D.A. Pearl L.H. Savva R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 143: 267-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inactive mutant clones were stored as 50% glycerol stocks at −80 °C. Expression of D88N mutant resulted in low level expression of insoluble protein under the standard expression conditions (13Savva R. Pearl L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 910-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and optimum expression was obtained by growing the bacteria to A 600 nm = 0.8–1.0 at 28 °C, before inducing with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-D thiogalactopyranoside for 36 h. The H210N mutant was expressed under the standard conditions (13Savva R. Pearl L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 910-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Purification was by the following method. Following lysis of cells and partition of soluble and insoluble fractions, (13Savva R. Pearl L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 910-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the clarified supernatant was applied to a two-column system (60 ml Q-Sepharose outlet into the inlet of 60 ml SP-Sepharose) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.3, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol chilled in an ice-bath. A wash of 800 ml of the equilibration buffer was performed subsequent to loading, and a further 400 ml wash using the same buffer was then performed on the SP-Sepharose column alone. A 0 to 1.6 msodium chloride gradient was run through the SP-sepaharose column over 7 column volumes. Fractions containing the bulk of mutant UDG, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, were pooled and diluted such that the final sodium chloride concentration was less than 50 mm, using buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl/10 mm EDTA pH 8.3, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The diluted protein was loaded onto a 25-ml poly-U-Sepharose column, pre-equilibrated in buffer B. A wash of 5-column volumes of buffer B with 100 mm sodium chloride was performed after loading, and then a gradient of 100–250 mm sodium chloride over 5-column volumes was performed. UDG mutant protein was eluted in a 2m sodium chloride step. Dialysis was performed twice against 100 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The proteins were shown to be greater than 95% pure after this procedure, with D88N having a final yield of 2 mg/liter bacterial culture and with H210N having a final yield of 15 mg/liter bacterial culture. Proteins were concentrated following purification in Amicon-stirred ultrafiltration cells using PM10 membranes (Amicon Corp.). The D88N mutant was far less soluble than H210N, and was used for crystallization trials at 15 mg/ml. The H210N mutant was used at 35 mg/ml. Purified concentrated proteins were 0.22-mm filtered in Ultrafree MC microcentrifuge cups (Millipore), and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and sodium azide were added to final concentrations of 0.1 mm and 0.02% (w/v), respectively. The protein stocks were then stored at 4 °C where they were stable for several months. Both mutants were put through crystallization trials using the Hampton research crystal screen, implemented as 1:1 microbatch mixtures under paraffin oil in Terazaki plates (15Chayen N.E. Shaw-Stewart P.D. Maeder D.L. Blow D.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1990; 23: 297-302Crossref Google Scholar). Plates were stored at 16 °C in the dark. Similar screens were also performed for proteins mixed at ratios of 1:2 (protein:ligand) with nucleotides and oligonucleotides. The Ugi protein was prepared as described previously (16Savva R. Pearl L.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 287-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and immobilized on Affi-Gel 15 cationic beads (Bio-Rad) using the following protocol. Beads, stored as supplied at −20 °C, were allowed to reach room temperature over 30 min with occasional inversion of the bottle. After thoroughly resuspending the beads by inversion and agitation, a volume of approximately 120 μl was withdrawn with a 1-ml micropipettor using a wide bore tip (made by sawing off one-third of the tapered end) and transferred to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. The tube was pulsed for 30 s at 16,000 × g to pellet the beads, and the bulk of the isopropanol-rich medium was discarded. A volume of 500 μl of ice-cold deionized water was added to the beads, and the tube was vortexed for 5 s. The tube was pulsed as described, and the water was discarded. This was repeated twice more, and then finally with 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0. Upon discarding the HEPES-NaOH, 400 μl of HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, containing 3 mg of purified Ugi protein was added to the beads. The tube was agitated gently to suspend the beads in the protein solution, and the agitation was continued on a shaker for 90 min at room temperature. The protein binds to the beads through lysine ε-amino groups during this step. The tube was pulsed as described previously, and the supernatant was removed and stored. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of 50 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, as described earlier, with the supernatant being stored after each spin. After removing the supernatant following the final spin, 10 μl of freshly prepared ethanolamine, pH 8.0, were added and mixed in by tapping the tube gently; the tube was allowed to stand for an hour at room temperature. This step blocks any beads that have not bound protein. The tube was pulsed as described previously, discarding the supernatant, and was washed twice with 400 μl of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, discarding the supernatant each time. The beads were then ready to use. The oligonucleotide sequence used in these experiments was 5′-biotin-CCGAATCAGTTCACTTCNAGCCGAGGTATTTAGCC, for oligonucleotides ssC and ssU, where N is C in ssC and N is U in ssU. The nonbiotinylated oligonucleotides were 5′-GGCTAAATACCTCGGCTNGAAGTGAACTGATTCGG where N is either A or G to form the duplexes dsU/A and dsU/G, respectively, with the biotinylated strand ssU, and the duplex dsC/G with ssC. Oligonucleotide synthesis was performed on an Applied Biosystems 394 DNA synthesizer on the 0.2-μm scale using cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry. Standard DNA synthesis reagents and cyanoethyl phosphoramidite monomers were obtained from Applied Biosystems, Ltd. The biotin phosphoramidite was obtained from Cruachem Ltd. and used as a 0.15 m solution in anhydrous acetonitrile; the coupling time was extended to 3 min. Stepwise coupling efficiencies were measured automatically on the synthesizer by trityl analysis, and all monomers were coupled at greater than 98%. Oligonucleotides were deprotected in concentrated aqueous ammonia for 8 h at 55 °C. High performance liquid chromatography purification was carried out on a Gilson model 306 high performance liquid chromatography system using a Brownlee Aquapore octyl reverse phase column (10 × 250 mm) with a flow rate of 3 ml/min and a gradient of 0–75% buffer B over a period of 30 min. (Buffer A, 0.1 m triethylammonium acetate; buffer B, 0.1m triethylammonium acetate with 25% acetonitrile). In the case of oligonucleotides labeled with biotin, the correct product was the major peak (final peak to elute from the column). After high pressure liquid chromatography purification, the major product was evaporated to dryness and desalted using a Pharmacia NAP 10 column (Sephadex G25) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The principle of operation of the BIAcore biosensor and its use in analyzing protein-DNA interactions have been described before (17Spanopoulou E. Zaitseva F. Wang F.-H. Santagata S. Baltimore D. Panayotou G. Cell. 1996; 87: 263-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 21Jönsson U. Fägerstam L. Roos H. Rönnberg J. Sjölander S. Stenberg E. Stahlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Östlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 520-527PubMed Google Scholar). All interactions were analyzed in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20) at a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min and at a constant temperature of 25 °C. Biotinylated oligonucleotides were injected over a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (SA5, Pharmacia Biosensor) until a suitable level was achieved (see “Results”). For the formation of double-stranded oligonucleotides, nonbiotinylated DNA was injected until no more increase in binding to the immobilized single-stranded DNA could be observed. Bound protein was eluted from the DNA by a short pulse (5 μl) of 0.05% SDS. This regeneration procedure did not alter to any measurable extent the ability of the immobilized DNA to bind protein in subsequent cycles. Analysis of the data was performed using the evaluation software supplied with the instrument. To eliminate small “bulk” refractive change differences at the beginning and end of each injection (due to small differences in buffer composition of the stock protein solutions), a control sensorgram obtained over a nonbinding surface was subtracted for each protein injection. For obtaining the association and dissociation rate constants the following equations were used, respectively. R=Req[1−e−(kaC+kd)(t−t0)]Equation 1 and R=R0e−kd(t−t0)Equation 2 R, R 0, and R eq are the response at time t,t 0, and at equilibrium, respectively;C, the concentration of protein; k a, the association rate constant; k d, the dissociation rate constant; and t 0, the start time of the dissociation or association. For the determination of the equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) from binding experiments R=Rmax·CKD+CEquation 3 was used (where R max is the maximum response level). The integrity of the tertiary structures of the mutant proteins was verified in the absence of catalytic activity against a standard substrate routinely used to assay UDGs (14Koulis A. Cowan D.A. Pearl L.H. Savva R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 143: 267-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by the following methods. First, Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage PBS1 Ugi protein (16Savva R. Pearl L.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 287-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) immobilized on Affi-Gel 15 beads, was shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to sequester and by standard assay (14Koulis A. Cowan D.A. Pearl L.H. Savva R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 143: 267-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to inactivate wild-type HSV1 UDG. Similarly immobilized Ugi protein was shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to sequester both mutants with similar affinity to its capture of wild-type enzyme. To remove the UDG or mutants from the Ugi protein, it was necessary to heat the beads in the presence of SDS. As a control, whole protein from an E. coli whole cell lysate was shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to bind very weakly apart from E. coli UDG, which was retained strongly. This strongly suggests that the DNA-binding channel and overall fold of the mutant proteins do not significantly differ from that of the wild-type enzyme. The second method used to indicate correct folding was using crystallization and x-ray diffraction. Both D88N and H210N mutants were crystallized using the Hampton research crystal screen following purification, and the latter also formed rectangular rod-like crystals spontaneously in situ after 10 days at 4 °C, average size 80 mm thick by 200 mm long, which diffracted to 2.5 Å on a laboratory source. The spacegroup was found to be P21 with unit cella = 42.9 Å, b = 61.6 Å,c = 43.9 Å, and β = 93.05, with a solvent content of 58% and 1 molecule in the asymmetric unit. Due to the fact that this is a monoclinic crystal form, a complete dataset has not yet been collected, and a structure is not yet available. The needle-like crystals of the D88N and H210N mutants obtained in crystal screens from polyethylene glycol 4000/buffer mixtures were too small for x-ray analysis, but co-crystals of the D88N mutant with the single-stranded trideoxynucleotide pdTpdTpdU, resulted in six-sided plates with average dimensions of 100-mm across by 20–50-mm thick. These crystals are seen to diffract beyond 2.6 Å at a synchrotron radiation source. Further characterization is in progress. The D88N mutant also yields rod-like crystals with the nucleotides 3′-dUMP and 5′-dUMP, and both mutants yield large orthorhombic rods with the trideoxynucleotide pdTpdTpdT identical to those obtained with the wild-type enzyme. Crystals of macromolecules, which diffract to medium and high resolution, are a good indication that there is inherent order and homogeneity in the components of the lattice. Morphological changes of protein crystals in the presence of potential ligands is a good indication that productive binding has taken place, demonstrating that the protein is correctly folded. The BIAcore biosensor was used to measure the specificity and affinity of the interactions between mutant or wild-type enzyme and single- or double-stranded oligonucleotides. In this system, the biotinylated oligonucleotide is immobilized on a streptavidin-coated dextran layer attached to a sensorchip, and the protein is injected at a constant flow rate. The biosensor measures refractive index changes close to the dextran layer, which in turn correspond to changes in the amount of protein bound to the surface. The plot of bound protein (measured in arbitrary resonance units (RU)) versus time is called a sensorgram and can be used to derive kinetic or equilibrium constants. This method has been used before to study other protein-DNA interactions (17Spanopoulou E. Zaitseva F. Wang F.-H. Santagata S. Baltimore D. Panayotou G. Cell. 1996; 87: 263-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Fisher R.J. Fivash M. Casas Finet J. Erickson J.W. Kondoh A. Bladen S.V. Fisher C. Watson D.K. Papas T.

Biochem. 1993; 214: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To immobilize double-stranded oligonucleotides, one of the strands was biotinylated and attached to the surface first and then the other strand was injected at saturating amounts until no further binding was observed (see “Experimental Procedures”). Complete formation of double-stranded DNA was verified by observing approximate doubling of the static resonance signal after the annealing of the second strand (Fig. 2). There was no measurable dissociation of DNA from the surface even after many cycles of binding and regeneration. Measurements of protein-DNA interactions were obtained by passing protein solutions over the immobilized oligonucleotides on the surface of the chip and analyzing the resulting sensorgrams. Initial experiments were designed to check the specificity of binding to uracil-containing DNA and therefore the maximum possible amounts of oligonucleotides ssC and ssU (see “Experimental Procedures”) were immobilized on the streptavidin-coated chip (approximately 1100 RU). The mutant D88N and H210N proteins were then passed over both surfaces. As can be seen in Fig. 1 even with these high amounts of immobilized DNA, there was no significant binding to oligonucleotide ssC, demonstrating the absolute requirement for uracil in specific recognition. When the wild-type enzyme was tested, no binding was observed to oligonucleotides ssC or ssU. The most obvious interpretation for this observation would be the rapid removal of uracil by the active enzyme making it impossible to detect a stable enzyme·DNA complex. This was confirmed by testing the binding of mutant enzyme before and after injection of the wild-type enzyme. Fig.3 shows that following application of the active enzyme, the mutant D88N was no longer capable of interacting with the surface, indicating that almost all of the available uracil had been removed. The same result was obtained with mutant H210N (not shown). The much lower binding displayed after removal of the uracil by the wild-type enzyme indicates that neither the wild-type nor the mutants have significant affinity for the abasic sites generated in the single-stranded DNA by the uracil-excision reaction.Figure 3Uracil excision by the wild-type enzyme abolishes UDG binding to ssDNA. Immobilized ssU oligonucleotide was allowed to interact with D88N before and after injection of an equal concentration of wild-type enzyme. The arrows point to the start and end of each injection. The sharp decreases in the signal after the interaction are due to the regeneration step to remove bound protein (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Two different nonbiotinylated oligonucleotides (ssG and ssA, see “Experimental Procedures”) were used to create double-stranded DNA (dsU/G and dsU/A) using immobilized, biotinylated oligonucleotides ssU, and dsC/G using immobilized, biotinylated ssC. As with ssC, dsC/G showed no indications of binding with the wild-type enzyme nor either of the mutants (results not shown). Fig.4 shows the relative binding of a single concentration of mutant H210N to four surfaces coated with the same amount (approximately 200 RU of single-strand oligonucleotides) of ssC, ssU, dsU/G and dsU/A (similar results were obtained with both mutants, data not shown). Both double-strand oligonucleotides bound protein with reduced affinity compared with ssU, and binding to dsU/A was considerably reduced compared with dsU/A. As with the single-stranded uracil-containing oligonucleotides, treatment with wild-type UDG effectively abolished subsequent binding by wild-type or mutant enzymes, indicating that neither the wild-type nor mutant enzymes display significant affinity for the abasic sites in double-stranded DNA produced by the uracil-excision reaction (Fig. 5).Figure 5Uracil excision abolishes UDG binding to dsDNA. Binding of D88N UDG to immobilized dsU/G oligonucleotide before and after uracil excision by wild-type UDG. In contrast with the high affinity for the uracil-containing duplex, neither wild-type nor mutant UDGs are retained on the product oligonucleotide containing an abasic site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To obtain a quantitative comparison, we took advantage of the fact that equilibrium was reached for all these interactions, and therefore the equilibrium dissociation constant could be determined by injecting a range of concentrations and plotting the response at equilibriumversus the concentration of injected protein. For these assays as well as for kinetic analysis (see below), the level of immobilized oligonucleotides was further reduced to approximately 40 RU to avoid possible artifacts due to mass transport limitations. Furthermore, it has been suggested (20Chang K.-J. Jacobs S. Cuatrecasas P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 406: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) that the measurement ofK D values by equilibrium binding assays is affected by the amount of “receptor” used, and considerable deviations can be observed from the true values if the levels are too high. Whereas the overall response was small, the data obtained in this way fitted very well to an equation describing a simple bi-molecular interaction obeying the law of mass action (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results of these experiments for the mutant H210N are summarized in Table I. An example of the fits obtained using Equation 3 is shown in Fig. 6 for binding t"

Glc6Pase is inhibited in the presence of phosphoinositides in a dose-dependent manner within a range of concentration 0.5–10 μm. The order of efficiency in untreated microsomes is: phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3,4,5P3 > PI3,4P2 = PI4,5P2 > PI3P = PI4P > PI. In contrast, Glc6Pase is not inhibited in the presence of phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine, diacylglycerol, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate at concentrations up to 100 μm. The mechanism of Glc6Pase inhibition by PI4,5P2, PI3,4P2, and PI3,4,5P3 is competitive in both untreated and detergent-treated microsomes. In untreated microsomes, the K i for PI3,4,5P3 (1.7 ± 0.3 μm, mean ± S.D. n = 3) is significantly lower (p< 0.01) than that for PI3,4P2 (5.0 ± 0.8 μm) and for PI4,5P2 (4.7 ± 0.7 μm). In detergent-treated microsomes, Glc6Pase is less sensitive to the inhibition and there is no difference anymore among the K i values for the three compounds: 8.3 ± 0.8, 11.1 ± 0.5 and 8.9 ± 0.4 μm for PI3,4,5P3, PI3,4P2, and PI4,5P2, respectively. This inhibition phenomenon might be of special importance with regards to the insulin's inhibition of hepatic glucose production.

Hanson R.W. Mehlman M.A. Gluconeogenesis: Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. John Wiley and Sons, New York1976: 53-152Google Scholar). It allows the gluconeogenic tissues in which it is specifically expressed to release glucose in blood. Numerous data have been provided during the last years, strongly suggesting that Glc6Pase might play an important regulatory role in the glucose release by the liver and the kidney, through mechanisms involving either gene expression (2Haber B.A. Chin S.

Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast with most of the other regulatory enzymes of liver glucose metabolism, Glc6Pase is a very hydrophobic protein localized within the reticulum endoplasmic membrane (1Nordlie R.C. Hanson R.W. Mehlman M.A. Gluconeogenesis: Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. John Wiley and Sons, New York1976: 53-152Google Scholar, 8Mithieux G. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This particular location within the cell is currently not explained. The observation that the kinetic properties of the enzyme are crucially dependent on the presence or the absence of the membrane has pointed out the importance of membrane lipids in the regulation of Glc6Pase activity in situ (8Mithieux G. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In our previous works, we characterized the inhibition effect of unsaturated fatty acids (9Mithieux G. Bordet J.C. Minassian C. Ajzannay A. Mercier I. Riou J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and of fatty acyl-CoA esters (10Mithieux G. Zitoun C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) on Glc6Pase activity. In the present work, we have addressed the question of the possible modulation of Glc6Pase activity by phospholipids themselves. Numerous previous studies have been devoted to the role of phospholipids in the stability and/or the activity of Glc6Pase by means of the effects induced by various phospholipases (11Zakim D. J.

We have paid special attention to 3-phosphoinositides, the lipid products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, since there is growing evidence to suggest that this enzyme is essential for insulin's regulation of glucose metabolism (see Ref. 17Shepherd P.R. Nave B.T. O'Rahilly S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 17: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar as a recent review). l-α-Phosphatidylcholine (1-palmitoyl,2-linoleoyl) (PC), l-α-phosphatidylserine (PS), l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (1,2-dioleoyl) (PE),l-α-phosphatidic acid (1,2-dioleoyl) (PA), diacylglycerol (1-stearoyl-2 arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol) (DAG),l-α-phosphatidylinositol (PI),l-α-phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PI4P),l-α-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PI4,5P2), d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) were obtained from Sigma (La Verpillière, France). l-α-Phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate (1,2-dipalmitoyl) (PI3P), l-α-phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (1,2-dipalmitoyl) (PI3,4P2), andl-α-phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (1,2-dipalmitoyl) (PI3,4,5P3) were obtained from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). PI3P, PI3,4P2, and PI3,4,5P3 were also synthesized from PI, PI4P, and PI4,5P2 using PI3K immunopurified from human platelets and purified by thin layer chromatography as described previously (18Payrastre B. Gironcel D. Plantavid M. Mauco G. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All lipids were stored in chloroform/methanol (1:1) under N2 at −80 °C. Microsomes were obtained from livers of 48-h fasted rats, as described previously (9Mithieux G. Bordet J.C. Minassian C. Ajzannay A. Mercier I. Riou J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The term “untreated microsomes” refers to microsomes suspended in 10 mm Hepes, 0.25 m sucrose, pH 7.4, without further treatment. “Detergent-treated” refers to microsomes which were treated in the presence of 0.5% (mass/volume) cholate for 20 min at 4 °C. Glc6Pase assay was performed in the presence of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3 for 10 min at 30 °C (the Glc6Pase velocity was a linear function of time for 15 min under all conditions of substrate concentration). Lipids were dried under N2 and resuspended by sonication in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3. They were added to microsomes previously diluted in the Tris buffer (see above). The reaction was immediately started by the addition of Glc6P (1.25–25 mm final concentration). Pi was determined by a complexometric method after the reaction had been stopped by addition of ascorbic acid/trichloroacetic acid (2%/10%, mass/volume) (19Baginsky E.S. Foa P.F. Zak B. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2. Verlag Chemie International, Deerfield Beach, FL1974: 876-880Google Scholar). To allow valuable comparisons, microsomes were present at a constant concentration (60 μg of protein/ml, Lowry assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard) in all experiments. Glucose-6-phosphatase, assayed in untreated microsomes, was not affected in the presence of PE or PS within the range of concentration of 0.5 to 10 μm. In contrast, it was slightly inhibited in the presence of PI and PI3P, and strongly inhibited in the presence of PI3,4P2 and PI3,4,5P3 within the same concentration range (Fig. 1). The inhibition was dependent on the phosphorylated state of the inositol ring: the higher the phosphate number, the more pronounced the inhibitory effect. In some instances, higher lipid concentrations (20 and 50 μm) were studied. The maximal inhibitory effect (75–80%) was reached from 5–10 μm for PI3,4,5P3 (Fig. 1) and from 20 μm for PI3,4P2 (not shown). The highest inhibitory effects were obtained at 50 μm for PI3P and PI (about 60 and 40% inhibition, respectively). The relative efficiencies of phosphoinositides were compared at a concentration producing half-maximal inhibition of Glc6Pase activity (for PI3,4,5P3), e.g. 2 μm. PI3,4,5P3 was about 2.5 times more efficient than PI3,4P2 and 10–20 times more efficient than PI or PI3P. PI4P and PI4,5P2 had similar inhibitory efficiencies as their respective isomers PI3P and PI3,4P2 (not shown). The inhibitory effect was the same whether microsomes had been preincubated in the presence of the inhibitors for 15 min at 25 °C or not. The dose-dependent inhibition effects were the same whether the inhibitors were added in the absence (Fig. 1) or in the presence of 20 μm PS (final concentration in the assay). Since the nature of the fatty acid esterified in positions 1 and 2 of glycerol might influence the inhibition effect (3-phosphoinositides (dipalmitoyl-) from Matreya were synthetically obtained), D3-phosphoinositides were also synthesized in vitro from their natural precursors from Sigma (purified from bovine brain and likely enriched in arachidonic acid in position 2 of glycerol). However, both types of 3-phosphoinositides had very similar effects and the results presented in Fig. 1 constitute a mixing of both sets of results. Other compounds were tested up to concentrations of 100 μm: neither PE, PS, PC, nor DAG or IP3 (e.g. the products of the hydrolysis of PI4,5P2by phospholipase C) inhibited Glc6Pase (not shown). In contrast, PA slightly inhibited Glc6Pase to the same extent as Pi (not shown). After detergent treatment of microsomes, Glc6Pase was less sensitive to the inhibition by PI3,4,5P3. The enzyme was inhibited by 50% at 10 μm (not shown). In addition, there was no clear difference with the inhibition effect induced by PI3,4P2 and PI4,5P2 (see below). The kinetics of Glc6Pase in untreated and detergent-treated microsomes (velocity versus the substrate concentration) were hyperbolic in the absence and in the presence of the inhibitors (studied at concentration of 2, 5, and 10 μm in untreated microsomes and 5, 10, and 20 μm in untreated microsomes). The double reciprocal plots (Lineweaver-Burk plots) fitted straight lines in all cases and converged on the same point located on the ordinate axis (data not shown). This revealed a classical pure competitive inhibition mechanism. The respective K i values for PI3,4,5P3, PI3,4P2, and PI4,5P2 were determined from Dixon plots (reciprocal of the velocity versus the inhibitor concentration). TheK i of PI3,4,5P3 was three times lower than the respective Kis of PI3,4P2 and PI4,5P2for Glc6Pase in untreated microsomes, and five times lower than its corresponding value in detergent-treated microsomes (TableI).Table IInhibition parameters of Glc6Pase by phosphoinositidesMicrosomesK iPI4,5P2PI3,4P2PI3,4,5P3μmUntreated4.7 ± 0.85.0 ± 0.71.7 ± 0.31-aSignificantly different from both PI4,5P2 and PI3,4P2 values, p < 0.01 (Fisher's test).Detergent-treated8.9 ± 0.41-bSignificantly different from corresponding value in untreated microsomes, p < 0.01.11.1 ± 0.51-bSignificantly different from corresponding value in untreated microsomes, p < 0.01.8.3 ± 0.81-bSignificantly different from corresponding value in untreated microsomes, p < 0.01.1-a Significantly different from both PI4,5P2 and PI3,4P2 values, p < 0.01 (Fisher's test).1-b Significantly different from corresponding value in untreated microsomes, p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab In this paper, we report that Glc6Pase is specifically inhibitedin vitro in the presence of minute amounts of a particular class of phospholipids, e.g. phosphoinositides. In contrast, it is unaffected upon addition of the other major phospholipids of the membrane, even at high concentrations. Noteworthy, the most potent effector is PI3,4,5P3, the major product of PI3K activity (20Stephens L.R. Hughes T.K. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1991; 351: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 21Stephens L. Jackson T. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17162-17172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is three times more efficient than its lipid precursor (PI4,5P2) to inhibit Glc6Pase in untreated microsomes. Although microsomes constitute artificially revesiculated membranes, in which some specific properties of Glc6Pase could have been lost, as compared with Glc6Pase assayed in homogenates from livers freeze-clamped in situ (22Minassian C. Daniele N. Bordet J.C. Zitoun C. Mithieux G. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 2727-2732PubMed Google Scholar) or in filipin-permeabilized isolated hepatocytes (23Jorgenson R.A. Nordlie R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5907-5915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nordlie R.C. Jorgenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4768-4771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one may suppose that they represent an acceptable environment to characterize in vitro the inhibition mechanisms of Glc6Pase under a conformational state close to that in vivo. That the enzyme is less efficiently inhibited by PI3,4,5P3 after detergent solubilization of the reticulum membrane, and has lost the difference in sensitivity between the inhibition by PI3,4,5P3 and by PI3,4P2 or PI4,5P2, may agree with this assumption. Numerous hypotheses have been put forward in the past to account for the structural organization of Glc6Pase within the microsomal membrane, from the simplest (monomeric protein) to the most complex (system involving several distinct proteins). From recent results from us and others (reviewed in Ref. 8Mithieux G. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we have suggested that Glc6Pase could be a unique transmembrane protein (which however might be either a homo- or a heteromultimer). The velocity and substrate specificity of the enzyme should be dramatically dependent on at least three different types of structural conformations, which could be related to the surrounding lipidic environment (8Mithieux G. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Whether microsomes had been treated by detergent or not, the mechanism of inhibition of Glc6Pase by PI3,4,5P3, PI3,4P2, and PI4,5P2 is purely competitive. This strongly suggests that the substrate site is involved as a site of interaction of the inhibitors. This is not unexpected given the obvious structural analogy between the phosphorylated inositol ring and Glc6P. However, it is important to note that the lipidic part of the molecule is required for this interaction to take place, since IP3 has no inhibitory effect alone, even at concentrations by 10 times higher. This suggests that the association of the lipidic part of the inhibitors to some hydrophobic regions of the enzyme (either on the catalytic unit or on putative associated polypeptide(s) might stabilize the interaction between the phosphorylated ring and the catalytic site. This should strongly favor the formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex (K i values are in the micromolar range) with regards to the enzyme-substrate complex (K m is in the millimolar range). That the K i values for the enzyme in detergent-treated microsomes are slightly higher than the corresponding ones in untreated microsomes suggests that the enzyme-inhibitor interaction is weakened upon the conformational change induced by the removal of surrounding lipids (8Mithieux G. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, it has been reported that the treatment of rat liver microsomes by a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C induced a decrease of the Glc6Pase K m (14Sawaki K. Taguchi R. Isekawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with the elimination of a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. Numerous recent studies strongly suggest that PI3K is an essential enzyme in the signal transduction of insulin to glucose metabolism in various cell types (17Shepherd P.R. Nave B.T. O'Rahilly S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 17: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For example, there is a good correlation between the insulin's stimulation of PI3K activity and of glucose transport in isolated rat adipocytes (25Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. Chen K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3423-3428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and between the inhibition of PI3K by specific inhibitors and the blockade of insulin stimulatory effects on glucose transporter translocation and glucose transport in 3T3-L1 (26Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) and isolated (27Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) adipocytes and in cultured myocytes and rat muscle (28LeMarchand-Brustel Y. Gautier N. Cormont M. VanObbergen E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3564-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Also, insulin's stimulation of PI3K activity is strongly reduced in the insulin resistant liver of the diabetic ob/ob mouse (29Folli F. Saad M.J.A. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The availability of synthetic analogues of 3-phosphoinositides has allowed to identify recently a variety of binding protein (see Ref. 30Toker A. Cantley L.C.

Among them, different isotypes of protein kinase C have been shown to be activated in the presence of PI3,4,5P3 (31Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

However, the present work is the first report of the inhibition by PI3,4,5P3 of a key enzyme in glucose metabolism. There has been compelling indirect evidence provided that the activity of this enzyme is negatively regulated by insulin (6Gardner L.B. Liu Z. Barrett E.J. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1614-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 8Mithieux G. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 34Christ B. Probst I.

With regards to the intracellular location of Glc6Pase (endoplasmic reticulum), it has been strongly suggested that the specificity of insulin to stimulate glucose transport via PI3K activation in adipocytes is dependent on the subcellular targeting of PI3K to low density microsomes, from which glucose transporters translocate (35Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Nave B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R. Biochem.

J. 1996; 313: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This might obviate the physiological concern that total PI3,4,5P3 is estimated to be by 10 times less abundant than its lipid precursor PI4,5P2 in most stimulated cells (38Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayatou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), while having only a three times higher potency to inhibit Glc6Pase in vitro. If such a microsome PI3K-targeting process takes place in the liver upon insulin stimulation, the ratio of PI3,4,5P3 to PI4,5P2 could be substantially higher in the close vicinity of Glc6Pase than elsewhere in the cell. It is also possible that the difference in sensitivity between the respective effects induced by the two compounds be higher in situ than in isolated microsomes (see above). Another important difference between the in vivo and in vitro situation is the way of access of the inhibitor to the enzyme: outside the membrane (in vitro)versus inside the membrane (in vivo). The competitive inhibition mechanism of microsomal Glc6Pase by the main lipid product of PI3K reported here might therefore be of special biological meaning."

Of the two human lysosomal Hex isozymes, only Hex A, not Hex B, cleaves GM2 in the presence of GM2activator. In contrast, mouse Hex B has been reported to be more active than Hex A in cleaving GM2 (Burg, J., Banerjee, A., Conzelmann, E., and Sandhoff, K. (1983) Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 364, 821–829). In two independent studies, mice with the targeted disruption of the Hexa gene did not display the severe buildup of brain GM2 or the concomitant abnormal behavioral manifestations seen in human Tay-Sachs patients. The results of these two studies were suggested to be attributed to the reported GM2 degrading activity of mouse Hex B. To clarify the specificity of mouse Hex A and Hex B and to better understand the observed results of the mouse model of Tay-Sachs disease, we have purified mouse liver Hex A and Hex B and also prepared the recombinant mouse GM2 activator. Contrary to the findings of Burget al., we found that the specificities of mouse Hex A and Hex B toward the catabolism of GM2 were not different from the corresponding human Hex isozymes. Mouse Hex A, but not Hex B, hydrolyzes GM2 in the presence of GM2activator, whereas GM2 is refractory to mouse Hex B with or without GM2 activator. Importantly, we found that, in contrast to human GM2 activator, mouse GM2activator could effectively stimulate the hydrolysis of GA2by mouse Hex A and to a much lesser extent also by Hex B. These results provide clear evidence on the existence of an alternative pathway for GM2 catabolism in mice by converting GM2 to GA2 and subsequently to lactosylceramide. They also provide the explanation for the lack of excessive GM2 accumulation in the Hexa gene-disrupted mice.

They also reported that the mouse activator preparation made from heat-treated mouse kidney extract was only slightly effective in stimulating the hydrolysis of GM2 by mouse Hex A and inhibited mouse Hex B in the same reaction. Recently, in two independent studies, mice with the targeted disruption of the Hexa gene were found to display neither the severe buildup of brain GM2 nor the concomitant abnormal behavioral manifestations seen in human classical Tay-Sachs patients (12Yamanaka S. Johnson M.D. Grinberg A. Westphal H. Crawley J.N. Taniike M. Suzuki K. Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9975-9979Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 13Cohen-Tannoudji M.

Genome. 1995; 6: 844-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In both studies, the mild manifestations were attributed to the reported GM2 degrading activity of mouse Hex B (3Burg J. Banerjee A. Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1983; 364: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Based on the fate of the radioactive GM1fed to embryonic fibroblasts derived from Hexa −/− and Hexb −/− mice, Sango et al. (14Sango K. Yamanaka S. Hoffmann A. Okuda Y. Grinberg A. Westphal H.

Genet. 1995; 11: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) proposed the presence of an alternative pathway in mice where sialidase acts upon GM2 to produce GA2 which can be hydrolyzed subsequently by Hex A or Hex B. To clarify the role of the mouse Hex A and Hex B in the catabolism of GM2 and also to understand better the observed results of the mouse models of classical Tay-Sachs disease (Type B GM2gangliosidosis), we have purified mouse liver Hex A and Hex B. We have also prepared the recombinant mouse GM2 activator. Using the recombinant human and mouse GM2 activators, we have studied the requirement of these two protein cofactors in the hydrolysis of GM2 and GA2 by mouse Hex A and Hex B. We have also studied the cross-reactivity of human and mouse GM2 activators by studying the stimulation of mouse Hex A by human GM2 activator and of human Hex A by mouse GM2 activator. GM2 was isolated from the brain of a Tay-Sachs patient (15Svennerholm L. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1972; 6: 464-474Google Scholar). GA2 was prepared from GM2 by mild acid hydrolysis (16Svennerholm L.

A pBluescript vector containing a 1.1-kilobase cDNA encoding the mouse GM2 activator (18Bellachioma G. Stirling J.L. Orlacchio A. Beccari T. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was used as a template to generate by polymerase chain reaction a shortened version of the encoding sequence which was homologous to the mature human GM2activator (19Wu Y.Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The upstream primer was 5′-ATG-ATG-GAT-CCG-GTG-GCT-TCT-CCT-GGG-ATA-3′ and the downstream primer was 5′-CAG-GCA-AGC-TTG-CTG-CTG-CCA-GGT-TAT-CTG-3′. This cDNA segment was subcloned into the pT7–7 expression vector atBamHI and HindIII sites, and its sequence was verified to contain the 486-base-pair DNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 32–193 of the mouse GM2 activator (18Bellachioma G. Stirling J.L. Orlacchio A. Beccari T. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The recombinant mouse GM2 activator was expressed and purified according to the procedures described previously for the human GM2 activator (19Wu Y.Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified mouse GM2 activator was confirmed by a pulse-liquid protein micro-sequencer equipped with an on-line microbore phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer (Applied BioSystems). Enzyme activity was determined by using fluorogenic substrates MUG and MUGS according to Potier et al. (20Potier M. Mameli L. Bélisle M. Dallaire L. Melançon S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The enzyme was incubated with 1.5 mm of substrate in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, in a total volume of 50 μl at 37 °C. After a set time, 1.5 ml of 0.2m sodium borate buffer, pH 9.8, was added to the reaction mixture to stop the reaction. The released MU was determined using a Sequoia-Turner Model 450 fluorometer. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount that liberates 1 μmol of MU/min at 37 °C. For glycolipid substrates GM2 and GA2, the reaction mixture contained 3 nmol of substrate in 40 μl of 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. The reactions were stopped by adding 40 μl of ethanol, and the mixtures were dried under vacuum, redissolved in 20 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and applied onto a thin layer chromatography plate. The plates were developed by chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, v/v/v), sprayed with diphenylamine reagent (21Harris G. MacWilliams I.C. Chem. Ind. (London). 1954; : 249Google Scholar), and heated at 115 °C for 15 min to visualize glycoconjugates. Initial rate measurements and determination of kinetic parameters for the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of synthetic substrates were conducted similarly to that described previously (22Yuziuk J.A. Nakagawa H. Hasegawa A. Kiso M. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out in 20 mmsodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, using 0–5.0 mm of the substrates MUG and MUGS. Purified mouse liver Hex A and Hex B were examined by FPLC chromatofocusing in a pH range of 7.4–3.8 using a Mono P HR 5/20 (0.5 × 20 cm) column. The starting buffer was 25 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.4, and the running buffer was Polybuffer 74 adjusted to pH 3.8 using HCl as described in the Pharmacia manual. After applying the sample onto the Mono P column, the column was eluted with the running buffer at 0.5 ml/min and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The molecular masses of purified mouse Hex A and Hex B were determined using Superose 6 FPLC gel filtration in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl. The column was first calibrated under the same conditions using ferritin (440,000), catalase (232,000), aldolase (158,000), ovalbumin (49,500), and chymotrypsinogen A (25,000) as molecular weight standards. All operations were performed at 0–5 °C except the chromatographies on Con A-Sepharose and SP-Fractogel that were carried out at room temperature. Centrifugation was routinely carried out at 30,000 × gfor 50 min using a Sorvall RC5C refrigerated centrifuge. Unless otherwise indicated, ultrafiltration was carried out with an Amicon stirred cell using a PM-10 membrane. Two hundred frozen mouse livers (391 g) were homogenized using a Polytron (Brinkmann) homogenizer with 5 volumes of cold phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as protease inhibitors, followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was brought to 30% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate. After 2 h, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was further brought to 65% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate. After standing overnight, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 500 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (buffer A). The suspension was placed into several dialysis bags and dialyzed against 10 liters of buffer A overnight, changing buffer every 4 h (4 changes). This crude enzyme preparation (780 ml) was centrifuged and applied to a DEAE-Fractogel column (5 × 45 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed overnight with buffer A at 2 ml/min, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.5m in the same buffer (total volume 4 liters), and 20-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were assayed for both MUG- and MUGS-cleaving activities. Hex B, which cleaves only MUG, was eluted in the nonadsorbed fractions (Fig. 1) and was concentrated by ultrafiltration. As shown in Fig. 1, MUG-cleaving activity eluted with NaCl as a main peak with a leading shoulder. The shoulder contained very low MUGS-cleaving activity, whereas the main peak contained both MUG- and MUGS-cleaving activities. Fractions in the main peak were pooled and concentrated to make a crude mouse Hex A preparation. This preparation was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column (5 × 90 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl. The column was eluted with the same buffer at 1 ml/min, and 20-ml fractions were collected. MUG- and MUGS-cleaving activities coeluted as a broad peak, and the entire peak was pooled (Fig.2 A) and concentrated to 25 ml by ultrafiltration. The concentrated Hex A was dialyzed thoroughly against buffer A overnight. The crude Hex B preparation (from DEAE-Fractogel column) was dialyzed against buffer A and applied to an SP-Fractogel column (2.5 × 17 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A at 2 ml/min and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.5 m in buffer A (total volume, 500 ml) and 17-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were assayed for MUG-cleaving activity. No activity was detected in the nonadsorbed fractions. The Hex B activity eluted as a single peak starting at 0.1m NaCl was pooled and concentrated to make an SP-Fractogel-purified mouse Hex B preparation (elution pattern not shown). This preparation was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column and eluted under the same conditions as the DEAE-Fractogel purified Hex A (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration chromatography of mouse Hex A (A) and Hex B (B). Mouse DEAE-Fractogel purified Hex A and SP-Fractogel purified Hex B enzyme preparations were applied onto a Sephacryl S-300 column (5 × 90 cm).

The column was washed with buffer A at 2 ml/min, followed by buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl and 17-ml fractions were collected. After the absorbance at 280 nm fell to a stable base line, the column was eluted with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.75m methyl-α-mannoside. No MUG-cleaving activity was detected in the nonadsorbed or 0.5 m NaCl eluted fractions. The fractions eluted by methyl-α-mannoside contained MUG-cleaving activity (elution pattern not shown) and were pooled and concentrated to 7 ml and dialyzed against buffer A. The mouse Hex B preparation after Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration was also applied to a Con A-Sepharose column and processed in the same manner as the Hex A. Hex B also adsorbed to the column and was specifically eluted using buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.75 mmethyl-α-mannoside. Hex B after the Con A-Sepharose step was purified about 1000-fold and was used for subsequent experiments. The dialyzed mouse Hex A preparation obtained after the Con A-Sepharose step was centrifuged and applied to an SP-Fractogel column (0.5 × 2 cm) equilibrated with buffer A (Fig.3). The column was washed with buffer A at 0.5 ml/min and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.5m in buffer A (total volume 40 ml) and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were assayed for both MUG- and MUGS-cleaving activities. As shown in Fig. 3, the nonadsorbed fractions contained the majority of the protein with about one-third of the enzyme activity. The MUG- and MUGS-cleaving activities coeluted as a complex peak beginning at about 0.15 m NaCl and was partially resolved from the main UV-absorbing material. When Hex A-containing fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, fractions 116–132 (Fig. 3) were found to contain only one major protein band and were pooled and concentrated. By the above procedure, Hex A was purified about 1500-fold from the crude enzyme preparation and was used for subsequent studies.

The gel was electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane in 20 mm Tris/150 mm glycine buffer, pH 8.0, containing 20% methanol at 18 V for 4 h using a Bio-Rad transfer apparatus. Membranes were overlaid with goat anti-human Hex A (24Hasilik A. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4937-4945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pennybacker M. Liessem B. Moczall H.

For visualization, the membrane was incubated with 8 mmol of 4-chloro-1-naphthol with 0.01% hydrogen peroxide to produce a purple color. The reaction was stopped by washing the membrane with water. The two major Hex isozymes were resolved from the crude mouse liver extract by DEAE-Fractogel chromatography at pH 7.0 (Fig. 1). The acidic mouse Hex A was purified to near homogeneity using the scheme described under “Experimental Procedures” as summarized in Table I. The Hex A after SP-Fractogel chromatography was used for the subsequent studies. By SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, the purified Hex A showed one broad protein band when stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). Immunostaining with anti-human Hex A revealed two overlapping bands of equal intensity corresponding to molecular sizes of approximately 57 and 59 kDa (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). This is in agreement with the postulated makeup of mouse Hex A, which is a heterodimer consisting of an α-subunit and a β-subunit, with molecular sizes before posttranslational processing of 60 and 61 kDa, respectively, as deduced from their cDNA sequences (26Beccari T. Hoade J. Orlacchio A. Stirling J.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Yamanaka S. Johnson O.N. Norflus F. Boles D.J. Proia R.L.

In humans, the β-subunit is posttranslationally processed to form two smaller polypeptides, β1 and β2, which are joined by disulfide bonds (29O'Dowd B.F. Cumming D.A. Gravel R.A. Mahuran D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 A,lane 2, shows that similar processing occurs in mouse Hex A, with the appearance under reducing conditions of two overlapping bands of about 27 and 24 kDa, and the concomitant disappearance of the 59-kDa band. Western blot analysis was used to confirm that the protein band visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining was indeed Hex A. Goat anti-human Hex A recognized both the nonreduced mouse Hex α- and β-subunits and the lower molecular size polypeptide chains after reduction (Fig. 4 B). The native molecular sizes of the mouse Hex A and Hex B were determined to be 110 and 120 kDa, respectively, as estimated using Superose 6 FPLC gel filtration. These values suggest that the native structures of mouse Hex A and Hex B consist of dimers as is the case for human enzymes. The isoelectric points of the two isoforms were estimated using Mono P FPLC chromatofocusing to be 5.4–3.8 for the purified mouse Hex A and 6.3–5.8 for the mouse Hex B. When crude mouse liver extract was chromatofocused under the same conditions, MUGS-cleaving activity was detected throughout a broader pH range extending from pH 6.5 to 3.8. Using MUG or MUGS in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, both mouse Hex A and Hex B exhibited maximal activity at pH 5.0. This value is slightly higher than the reported human value of 4.4 (8Wenger D.A. Okada S. O'Brien J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 153: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). TheK m value of Hex A toward MUG and MUGS were 0.98 mm and 0.72 mm, respectively. For Hex B, theK m value toward MUG was 0.90 mm and toward MUGS was 7.8 mm. Similar values were found for the human isozymes (8Wenger D.A. Okada S. O'Brien J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 153: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Inui K. Wenger D.A. Clin. Genet. 1984; 26: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 31Bayleran J. Hechtman P.

The molecular mass of the recombinant mouse GM2 activator determined by SDS-PAGE was 18.5 kDa, which is as expected from the cDNA sequence and is identical to that of the human GM2 activator. By Western blot analysis, mouse GM2 activator was recognized by the polyclonal antibodies against human GM2 activator, indicating similarities in protein structure, although with a weaker interaction than that for the human GM2 activator. The purified mouse Hex A and Hex B were examined for their ability to hydrolyze GM2. As shown in Fig.5 A, the specificities of the mouse Hex A and Hex B toward GM2 are the same as their human counterparts. Under the same conditions, mouse Hex A effectively hydrolyzes GM2 but only in the presence of the mouse GM2 activator (Fig. 5 A, lane 4, 88% hydrolysis). Similar to human Hex B, but in contrast to the previous report (3Burg J. Banerjee A. Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1983; 364: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), mouse Hex B is not able to cleave GM2 in the absence of GM2 activator (Fig. 5 A, lane 5) even after extended incubation (Fig. 5 A, lane 7). While in the presence of GM2 activator, only a very trace of GM3 production by mouse Hex B is detected after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 5 A, lane 6) or 6 h of incubation (Fig.5 A, lane 8). These results clearly indicate that mouse Hex B is similar to human Hex B with regard to the specificity for GM2 hydrolysis. To understand the reported observations on the studies of mouse Hex α-chain disruption (12Yamanaka S. Johnson M.D. Grinberg A. Westphal H. Crawley J.N. Taniike M. Suzuki K. Proia R.L. Proc. Natl.

Genome. 1995; 6: 844-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we also examined the ability of two mouse Hex isozymes to hydrolyze the GalNAc from GA2 (Fig.5 B). Under our assay conditions (30 min of incubation), mouse Hex A was found to slowly hydrolyze GA2 in the absence of mouse GM2 activator (Fig. 5 B,lane 3). We found that even though GA2 is refractory to human Hex A in the presence of human GM2activator (19Wu Y.Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse Hex A was able to effectively hydrolyze GA2 in the presence of mouse GM2 activator (Fig. 5 B, lane 4, 45% hydrolysis). Under the same conditions, mouse Hex B was not able to hydrolyze GA2in the absence of mouse GM2 activator (Fig. 5 B,lane 5), and no detectable hydrolysis was observed in the presence of mouse GM2 activator (Fig. 5 B,lane 6) after 30 min of incubation. However, after extended incubation (6 h of incubation), mouse Hex B was found to be able to slowly hydrolyze GA2 in the presence of mouse GM2 activator (Fig. 5 B, lane 8). It has been shown previously that the ceramide portion of the GM2 molecule is essential for hydrolysis by human Hex A (10Li S.-C. Hirabayashi Y. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6234-6240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wu Y.Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol.

As is the case for the human enzyme, neither mouse Hex isozyme was able to hydrolyze II3NeuAcGgOse3, the oligosaccharide derived from GM2, even in the presence of GM2 activator (data not shown).

Its transforming capacity is strictly dependent upon the N-terminal DNA binding domain, the central transactivation region, and on the C-terminal domain containing a putative leucine zipper motif. Here we show that the v-MybL3,4A mutant, in which Leu325 and Leu332 of the leucine zipper have been replaced by alanines, failed to induce leukemia in virus infected chicken. This demonstrates that the leucine zipper domain is indispensable for v-myb induced leukemogenesis in vivo. v-MybL3,4A was, however, still able to transform myelomonocytic cells from chicken bone marrow in vitro. Yet, while v-mybL3,4A transformed cells were impaired in growth at 37°C, they failed to grow at 42°C, the physiological body temperature of avian species. This might explain the loss of v-MybL3,4A leukemogenic potential in vivo. We also demonstrate that the v-Myb leucine zipper domain interacts in vitro with two host cell proteins, p26 and p28. This interaction is compromised in v-MybL3,4A indicating that binding of v-Myb to p26 and p28 might be important for the leukemogenic potential of v-Myb."

Recent studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between abundant expression of TrkA and a favorable prognosis of the pediatric tumor, neuroblastoma. This correlation suggests that TrkA may actively promote growth arrest and differentiation of neuroblastoma tumor cells and may be an important therapeutic target in the treatment of this disease. In the present study, we have examined the mechanistic basis for TrkA gene expression in human neuroblastoma cells. Northern blotting and nuclear run-on analyses demonstrated that transcription is a primary determinant of both cell-specific and variable expression of the TrkA gene in neuroblastoma cell lines that express it to different degrees. Cell-specific and variable transcription in neuroblastoma cells was recapitulated by transient transfection of TrkA promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, and regulatory sequences mediating these processes were localized to a 138-base pair region lying just upstream of the transcription initiation region. This neuroblastoma regulatory region formed multiple DNA-protein complexes in gel shift assays that were highly enriched in neuroblastoma cells exhibiting abundant TrkA expression. Thus, TrkA-positive neuroblastoma cells are distinguished by differential expression of putative transcription factors that ultimately may serve as targets for up-regulating TrkA expression in tumors with poor prognosis.

Neuroblastoma is a predominantly pediatric neoplasia with nearly all cases occurring in children younger than 10 years of age (1Matthay K.K. CA Cancer J. Clin. 1995; 45: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is the major form of extracranial solid tumor in children and accounts for 10–15% of childhood cancer-related deaths (2Brodeur G.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 7th Ed. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 1. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 697-716Google Scholar). Based on the early onset of this disease and the expression of specific cellular and developmental markers, neuroblastoma appears to arise from sympathoadrenal precursors that fail to undergo terminal differentiation and/or cell death during fetal development (2Brodeur G.M.

In particular, diploid DNA content, N-MYCamplification and chromosome 1p deletion are highly associated with rapid tumor progression and poor outcome. Conversely, near triploidy and absence of 1p deletions are linked to a favorable outcome in infants and greater responsiveness to chemotherapy (2Brodeur G.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S.

However, the outcome for neuroblastoma patients remains generally poor despite multitherapy strategies (2Brodeur G.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 7th Ed.

An interesting and characteristic feature of neuroblastoma is the occurrence of spontaneous regression or differentiation into benign ganglioneuromas in a minority of patients, independent of treatment (2Brodeur G.M.

Pathol. 1963; 43: 1089-1104PubMed Google Scholar). A critical question is what regulatory mechanisms characterize these spontaneously regressing neuroblastomas and distinguish them from the more aggressive, unfavorable forms? TrkA is a member of the neurotrophin tyrosine kinase receptor family that also includes TrkB and TrkC. TrkA specifically mediates signaling for nerve growth factor (NGF) 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). (although it can also be activated by NT-3) (12Barbacid M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) and is critical for both survival and terminal differentiation of sympathetic and a subset of sensory neurons (12Barbacid M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 13Snider W.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 627-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar, 14Lewin G.R. Barde Y.-A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). Within the central nervous system, TrkA signaling is important for basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, among other functions (14Lewin G.R. Barde Y.-A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). Recent findings have demonstrated that abundant expression of TrkA is strongly correlated with favorable prognosis for neuroblastoma, while low or absent expression is linked to a poor outcome (15Nakagawara A. Arima M. Azar C.G. Scavarda N.J. Brodeur G.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1364-1368PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nakagawara A. Arima-Nakagawa M. Scavarda N.J. Azar C.G. Cantor A.B. Brodeur G.M. N. Engl. J.

TrkA expression within neuroblastomas occurs specifically in neuroblasts and differentiated ganglion cells, with the highest levels occurring in the latter cells (20Donovan M.J. Hempstead B.L. Horvath C. Chao M.V. Schofield D. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1560-1567PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, forced expression of TrkA in neuroblastoma cells lacking this receptor converts them into NGF-responsive cells that undergo growth arrest and terminal differentiation in the presence of NGF (17Kogner P. Barbany G. Dominici C. Castello M.A. Raschella G. Persson H. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2044-2050PubMed Google Scholar, 21Matsushima H. Bogenmann E. Mol. Cell.

These findings have led to the suggestion that TrkA expression in neuroblastoma tumors actively promotes their growth arrest and differentiation into a regressed or benign state (16Nakagawara A. Arima-Nakagawa M. Scavarda N.J. Azar C.G. Cantor A.B. Brodeur G.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 24Brodeur G.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1537-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Alternatively, TrkA expression may be associated with a generally more differentiated state in neuroblastoma cells that are predisposed to growth arrest and further differentiation. Whether an active participant in neuroblastoma tumor arrest or simply a marker for a more differentiated state, elucidating the mechanisms responsible for TrkA expression (and its absence) in neuroblastoma cells is potentially of great importance for understanding and treating this disease. In particular, it may ultimately reveal regulatory mechanisms that distinguish favorable from poor prognosis tumors that could serve as future therapeutic targets. The existence of human neuroblastoma cell lines that express TrkA at low or moderate to high levels provides an opportunity to explore the determinants of its variable expression in this tumor cell type. To this end, we have examined the role of gene transcription in the differential expression of TrkA in various human neuroblastoma cell lines and have characterized the human TrkA promoter in these cells using transient transfection. Our findings indicate that proximal regulatory sequences play a critical role in both cell-specific and variable TrkA promoter activity in neuroblastoma cells.

The run-on reaction was performed with fresh nuclei as described previously (34Persengiev S.P. Robert S. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 742-747PubMed Google Scholar).

Data were quantified using a PDI DNA ImageWare System (Huntington Station, NY). A 3.1-kbHindIII fragment was isolated from an EMBL-3 genomic library derived from human placental DNA using a 236-bpEcoRI-SmaI fragment of the human TrkA cDNA as well as an oligonucleotide complementary to sequences 22–48 of the TrkA cDNA (5′-TCTGTGCGCTCCCAGCTGCAGCTGCCA-3′) as probes (31Martin-Zanca D. Oskam R. Mitra G. Copeland T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). This genomic sequence contained the 5′-flanking region as well as exon I and a portion of the first intron of the human TrkA gene based on dideoxy sequencing and comparison with the human TrkA cDNA sequence (31Martin-Zanca D.

Reverse transcription was carried out with SuperScript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 55 °C for 40 min. Reactions were phenol/chloroform-extracted, precipitated, and analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide-8 m urea sequencing gels. The plasmid pBS-N2.8 was generated by isolating aHindIII-NarI fragment from pJD1 and ligation into the HindIII and XhoI sites of pBluescript (KS). pTrkA-NarI was generated by BamHI digestion of pBS-N2.8 and self-ligation of the vector fragment. Antisense riboprobe was synthesized from BamHI-digested pTrkA-NarI using phage T3 RNA polymerase. Twenty μg of total RNA from various cell lines were hybridized and processed as described previously (38Kilpatrick D.L. Zinn S.A. Fitzgerald M. Higuchi H. Sabol S.L. Meyerhardt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3717-3726Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The 3.1-kbHindIII fragment from pJD1 was cloned into theHindIII site of pGL3 to generate pTrkLuc3.1 and pTrkLuc3.1AS (antisense). The pGL3basic vector was modified prior to this insertion by digestion with MluI, treatment with T4 DNA polymerase, and religation to remove the MluI site. pTrkLuc2.8 and pTrkLuc2.7 were made by partial digestion of pJD1 with NarI and treatment with Klenow fragment, followed by complete digestion withSpeI. The 2.7- and 2.8-kb fragments were then inserted into the HindIII and NheI sites of pGL3. pTrkLuc2.6 was produced by isolating a 2.6-kb KpnI-AflIII fragment from pTrkLuc3.1 and inserting it into pGL3 at theKpnI and HindIII sites. pTrkLuc1.2 was generated from pTrkLuc2.6 by digestion with NheI and SacII and religation of the 6.0-kb plasmid fragment. pTrkLuc1.0 and pTrkLuc0.7 were produced by digestion of pTrkLuc2.6 withBglII and SacI, respectively, followed by religation of the vector fragments. pTrkLuc0.2 was made from pTrkLuc2.6 by digestion with BamHI and NheI and self-ligation of a 5.1-kb vector fragment, and pTrkLuc0.14 was generated from pTrkLuc0.2 by digestion with SacI and ApaI and self-ligation of the 5.0-kb vector fragment. Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy method. The ApaI-AflIII region of the human TrkA promoter was sequenced completely on both strands using internal and external primers and analyzed for transcription factor binding elements using the TFsites program (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Supercoiled plasmid DNAs were prepared on Qiagen columns (Qiagen, CA), and constructs were transfected in duplicate. Co-transfected pCMV-β-galactosidase DNA was used for normalizing transfection efficiency and each construct was tested a minimum of three times. Nonspecific promoter activity was determined in each experiment using the antisense construct pTrkLuc3.1AS and its value was subtracted from the activity of each sense promoter construct after normalization. Nonspecific activities were approximately 10, 22, and 27% of total promoter activities for SMS-KCN, SH-SY5Y, and K293 cells, respectively. Cells were seeded 12–24 h prior to transfection in 35-mm culture dishes at 0.3–0.8 × 106 cells/dish. 1.5 μg of pTrkLuc construct, and 0.75 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase were combined with 6 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 medium (antibiotic- and serum-free) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA mixture was diluted with 800 μl of RPMI 1640 medium and then added to cells for 5 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with culture medium containing serum and antibiotics and cultured for an additional 43 h. Transfected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 200 μl 1 × lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and supernatants were stored at −80 °C. Luciferase reporter activities were assayed with a luciferase assay system (Promega) using a Packard Pico-Lite 6100 luminometer. Relative light units were normalized using the β-galactosidase activity determined in the same extract. β-Galactosidase activities were assayed using the fluorescence method as described by Stuart et al. (39Stuart G.W. Searle P.F. Chen H.Y. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7318-7322Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Reactions were assayed in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, model LS-3), by excitation at 365 nm and measurement at 445 nm. Purified β-galactosidase enzyme (Promega) was used as a standard. Protein extracts were prepared from freshly isolated nuclei in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of the proteinase inhibitors pepstatin A, bestatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin. Protein was determined using a Bio-Rad assay kit, and relative concentrations in different extracts were verified on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Coomassie Blue staining. Gel shift assays were performed as described previously by Galcheva-Gargova et al. (40Galcheva-Gargova Z. Tokeson J.P. Karagyosov L.K. Ebert K.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 979-991PubMed Google Scholar). The probe was prepared by isolating an ApaI-AflIII fragment from pTrkLuc2.7 and labeling by Klenow fill-in using [32P]dCTP. Binding reactions contained 1.0 ng of 32P-labeled probe and 3 μg of nuclear extract. Competition assays were performed with a 50-fold mass excess of unlabeled ApaI-AflIII genomic fragment or a double-stranded TATA box oligonucleotide: 5′-GCAGAGCATATAAGGTGAGGTAGGA-3′. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Neuroblastoma cell lines exhibit varying degrees of TrkA expression (41Iwata H. Ito T. Mutoh T. Ishiguro Y. Xiao H. Hamaguchi M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 42Nakagawara A. Azar C.G. Scavarda N.J. Brodeur G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 43Hartman D.S. Hertel C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1261-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and thus can be used to examine the basis for both its cell-specific and variable expression in this tumor cell type. Gene transcription often plays a primary role in cell-specific gene expression (44Maniatis T. Goodbourn S. Fischer J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). To determine whether this was the case for TrkA in human neuroblastoma cells, Northern blots were initially performed using different cell lines (Fig.1). SK-N-SH, IMR32, and SMS-KCN cells contained relatively high levels of a 2.9-kb TrkA mRNA, with IMR32 being the most enriched. In contrast, SH-SY5Y cells contained low levels of the 2.9-kb transcript, and LA-N-6 cells expressed intermediate levels. TrkA mRNA was undetectable in human kidney K293 cells (data not shown). Nuclear run-on studies were performed to determine the degree to which Northern blotting data reflected differences in the rate of TrkA gene transcription between various cell lines. In agreement with the above results, TrkA transcription was low but detectable in SH-SY5Y cells and ∼ 4–5-fold higher in SMS-KCN and IMR32 cells (Fig.2). No transcription was measurable in K293 cells. Thus, gene transcription appears to be a major determinant of both cell-specific and degree of TrkA expression in neuroblastoma cells. A combination of RNase protection and primer extension analysis was used to accurately localize the TrkA promoter region employed in human neuroblastoma cells. RNase protection was performed with a riboprobe (pTrk-NarI) complementary to sequences spanning the 5′-end of the human TrkA cDNA originally isolated from K562 erythroleukemia cells (31Martin-Zanca D. Oskam R. Mitra G. Copeland T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A). Analysis of total RNA from SH-SY5Y, SMS-KCN, and IMR32 cells revealed two prominent protection products of ∼110 and 125 nucleotides (nt) in each case (Fig. 3 B). Additional products ∼150–160 nt in length sometimes were observed upon longer exposure (e.g. in IMR32 cells, Fig. 3 B). No specific products were detected for TrkA-negative K293 kidney cells. The two major start sites predicted by these results lie ∼60–70 bp downstream of the 5′-end for the TrkA cDNA originally isolated from K562 cells (Fig. 3 A). Primer extension analysis was performed to further examine this question using a 47-bp oligonucleotide complementary to sequences between +174 and +221 relative to the TrkA translation start codon (Fig. 3 A). A single major extension product ∼281 nt in length was observed in SH-SY5Y, SMS-KCN, and IMR32 cells (Fig.3 C). The predicted initiation site based on this result occurs ∼32 bp upstream of the more 5′-major start site identified by RNase protection (Fig. 3 A). Together these findings indicate that transcription of the TrkA gene generally initiates in neuroblastoma cells from one or more sites within a 30–50-bp region lying just downstream of the 5′-end for the TrkA cDNA originally isolated from K562 erythroleukemia cells. To identify regions within the TrkA promoter that are important for expression in neuroblastoma cells, a series of promoter constructs were generated in the luciferase-containing plasmid, pGL3basic (Fig. 4). The largest of these, pTrkLuc2.8, consisted of a 2.8-kbHindIII-NarI fragment containing ∼2.6 kb of 5′-flanking sequence and a portion of exon I. Additional versions consisted of 5′- and/or 3′-deletions of pTrk2.8 as well as an antisense construct containing a 3.1-kb genomic fragment that served as a control for nonspecific activity. The low TrkA-expressing SH-SY5Y line and TrkA-negative K293 cells were transiently transfected with these various constructs to determine the presence of neuroblastoma cell-specific regulatory sequences within the human TrkA promoter. Transfection of SH-SY5Y cells yielded comparable promoter activity for all constructs tested (Fig.5 A). The smallest of these, pTrkLuc0.14, consisted of a 138-bp proximal 5′-flanking sequence defined by ApaI and AflIII sites lying just upstream of the transcription initiation region (see Fig. 4). While the activities of various constructs were generally constant in K293 cells as well, their absolute levels were ∼10-fold lower than in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the 138-bpApaI-AflIII region is sufficient to mediate neuroblastoma cell-specific regulation of the TrkA promoter. Based on the various constructs tested, no significant enhancer or repressor sequences are apparent lying upstream or downstream of this region.Figure 5Cell specificity of TrkA promoter activity in transiently transfected cells. A, luciferase activities for different pTrkLuc constructs in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.B, reporter activities of the same constructs in TrkA-negative human kidney K293 cells. For comparison, the activity of the pTrkLuc2.6 construct in SH-SY5Y cells is also shown.Bars indicate the standard errors of duplicate samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Northern and nuclear run-on analyses demonstrated that TrkA transcription occurs to varying degrees in human neuroblastoma cell lines, similar to what is observed in primary tumors. To explore the nature of the regulatory elements responsible for elevated transcription of the TrkA gene in neuroblastoma cells, promoter constructs also were transiently transfected into SMS-KCN cells. This neuroblastoma cell line exhibits a severalfold higher level of TrkA mRNA and transcription than occurs in SH-SY5Y cells (see Figs. 1 and 2). As with the other two cell lines examined, the activity of the pTrkLuc0.14 promoter construct was very similar to the longer versions tested (Fig. 6). In addition, absolute promoter activity was ∼5-fold greater than observed in SH-SY5Y cells. This indicates that enhanced TrkA promoter activity is recapitulated in transiently transfected SMS-KCN cells and that the relevant cis-elements are contained within a 138-bp proximal 5′-flanking region. It should be noted that further deletion of 102 bp from the 5′-end of the ApaI-Af1III sequence resulted in >93% loss of luciferase activity in all three cell lines (data not shown), confirming the critical importance of this region for TrkA promoter activity. The above findings indicated that nuclear factor interactions within the 138-bpApaI-AflIII region mediated both cell-specific and variable expression of the TrkA promoter in neuroblastoma cells. Gel shift experiments were performed to examine these interactions directly and compare them in different cell lines using theApaI-AflIII sequence as a probe. Four major complexes were detected in nuclear extracts prepared from SMS-KCN cells (Fig. 7, a–d), which express the TrkA gene at relatively high levels. All four complexes were specifically competed by a 50-fold excess of unlabeled homologous DNA but not by an equivalent amount of an unrelated competitor DNA. In SH-SY5Y cells, which express TrkA at low levels, complex awas present in concentrations similar to SMS-KCN cells butcomplex b was markedly reduced, and complexes cand d were extremely low (Fig. 7). The complexes detected in SH-SY5Y cells also were specifically competed by homologous unlabeled competitor. Further, all four complexes were essentially undetectable in TrkA-negative K293 cells. Thus, multiple DNA binding proteins interact with the proximal TrkA regulatory region mediating cell-specific and variable expression in TrkA-expressing neuroblastoma cells. These factors are extremely low in TrkA-negative cells and at least three of them (complexes b, c, and d) are specifically elevated in neuroblastoma cells exhibiting enhanced TrkA promoter activity. Sequence analysis of the ApaI-AflIII 5′-flanking region revealed the presence of multiple recognition sites for known transcription factors, including ATF, Sp1, ets factors,Egr-1, and AP2 (Fig. 8). In some cases, multiple consensus sequences are present and some sites are overlapping, as for Sp1, AP2, and Egr-1 elements. Certain of these sites, and/or yet to be defined regulatory elements, may be bound by factors selectively present in TrkA-expressing neuroblastoma cells and mediate cell-specific and variable TrkA promoter activity. While TrkA expression and/or signaling is often deficient in neuroblastoma cells derived from advanced stage tumors (45Azar C.G. Scavarda N.J. Reynolds C.P. Brodeur G.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 421-428PubMed Google Scholar, 46Chen J. Chattopadhyay B. Venkatakrishnan G. Ross A.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 79-85PubMed Google Scholar), its signal transduction pathway was shown to be intact in cells obtained from a favorable primary tumor (16Nakagawara A. Arima-Nakagawa M. Scavarda N.J. Azar C.G. Cantor A.B. Brodeur G.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Forced expression of TrkA in receptor-deficient neuroblastoma cells also leads to growth arrest and differentiation of tumors in nude mice following in vivotreatment with NGF (21Matsushima H. Bogenmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7447-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recent studies have further suggested that Schwann cells are capable of infiltrating favorable neuroblastomas and may provide a local source of NGF (47Ambros I.M. Zellner A. Roald B. Amann G. Ladenstein R. Printz D. Gadner H. Ambros P.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1505-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These and other studies have led to the hypothesis that TrkA has an active role in the spontaneous maturation/regression of favorable neuroblastoma tumors (16Nakagawara A. Arima-Nakagawa M. Scavarda N.J. Azar C.G. Cantor A.B. Brodeur G.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 24Brodeur G.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1537-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, a direct role for NGF and TrkA signaling in this process remains to be established. The strong correlation between high TrkA expression and a favorable outcome for neuroblastoma (16Nakagawara A. Arima-Nakagawa M. Scavarda N.J. Azar C.G. Cantor A.B. Brodeur G.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 21Matsushima H. Bogenmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7447-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22Lavenius E. Gestblom C. Johansson I. Nanberg E. Pahlman S. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 727-736PubMed Google Scholar, 23Poluha W. Poluha D.K. Ross A.H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 185-189PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that understanding the mechanisms responsible for TrkA expression in neuroblastoma cells is likely to provide important insight into this disease and may assist in the development of potentially novel treatments. For example, it could lead to therapies focused on induction of TrkA that, in combination with neurotrophin treatment, could promote tumor differentiation. Even if TrkA expression is simply a marker for a more differentiated tumor state, such analyses will reveal fundamental regulatory pathways that distinguish TrkA-expressing neuroblastoma cells from their TrkA-negative counterparts. The present studies form a strong basis for this approach by demonstrating a major role for gene transcription in the elevated expression of TrkA in neuroblastoma cells. In contrast, enhanced expression of N-MYC in human neuroblastoma cells is regulated largely at the level of mRNA stability (48Chagnovich D. Cohn S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33580-33586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Distinct mechanisms thus determine differential expression of these markers for neuroblastomas having favorable and poor prognoses. Ciselements mediating both cell-specific and elevated TrkA transcription in neuroblastoma cells have been localized to a 138-bp proximal promoter sequence. Differential gene transcription can occur by various mechanisms, including expression of unique transcription factors, elevated levels, and/or novel combinations of more generally expressed factors and epigenetic processes such as chromatin-dependent transcriptional effects or DNA methylation (49Kingston R.E. Bunker C.A. Imbalzano A.N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 50Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 51Hsieh C.-L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5487-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The present studies indicate that differential expression of DNA-binding proteins plays an important role in TrkA promoter regulation in neuroblastoma cells. That is, several DNA-protein complexes were identified involving the proximal regulatory promoter region that were common to TrkA-expressing neuroblastoma cells and extremely low or undetectable in TrkA-negative cells. Further, certain complexes were markedly elevated in a neuroblastoma cell line that transcribes the TrkA gene at relatively high levels. Although these findings do not rule out a role for chromatin structure or DNA methylation in TrkA promoter regulation, such mechanisms are not required for differential activation within the proximal 5′-flanking region defined here since it is unlikely they contribute to promoter activity determined in transient transfection assays. Several candidate elements were identified within the proximal regulatory region that may be bound by transcription factors specifically elevated in TrkA-expressing neuroblastoma cells. These include several GC-box sites such as for Sp1, AP2, and Egr-1, as well as sites for ATF and ets-related factors. Sp1 elements have been implicated in cell-specific or differentiation-associated regulation of several promoters, including those for p21/WAF1, hepatocyte growth factor and humanKDR/flk-II (52Prowse D.M. Bolgan L. Molnar A. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1308-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 53Patterson C. Wu Y. Lee M.-E. DeVault J.D. Runge M.S. Haber E.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Further, Egr-1 sites are involved in the regulation of certain neuronally expressed promoters, and this factor is expressed and inducible in neuroblastoma cells (55Petersohn D. Schoch S. Brinkmann D.R. Thiel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24361-24369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar,56Mutero A. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1866-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). ATF and AP2 family members also have an important role in neuronal gene expression (55Petersohn D. Schoch S. Brinkmann D.R. Thiel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24361-24369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 57Andersson G. Påhlman S. Parrow V. Johansson I.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Finally, ets domain proteins have been implicated in cell-specific gene expression and at least some members of this family are restricted to or enriched in neuronal cells, including PEA3 and NERF (55Petersohn D. Schoch S. Brinkmann D.R. Thiel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24361-24369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 60Xin J.H. Cowie A. Lachance P. Hassell J.A.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5091-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, the present findings define a region critical for TrkA promoter expression in neuroblastoma cells which contains several candidate regulatory elements. It is also possible that additional, novel regulatory elements exist within the proximal 5′-flanking region that remain to be identified. Their definition should provide important insight into the mechanistic basis for TrkA gene regulation in neuroblastoma.
