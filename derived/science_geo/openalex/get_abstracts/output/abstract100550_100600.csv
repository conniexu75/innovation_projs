https://openalex.org/W1969250152,"A ubiquitous cell adhesion receptor, CD44, preferentially binds hyaluronan, a poly-saccharide macromolecule that is present in most extracellular matrices. Hyaluronan molecules have large hydrodynamic volumes that entrap substantial amounts of water and can therefore control tissue hydration (swelling). CD44 is overexpressed by synovial cells and leukocytes, and hyaluronan is overproduced in the rheumatoid synovium and in other inflammatory sites. Nevertheless, the role of the CD44–hyaluronan interaction during inflammation is unclear. Our evidence shows that the CD44 receptor plays a critical role in governing the migration of inflammatory leukocytes into the extravascular compartment of the synovium in murine arthritis. An anti-CD44 antibody induces a rapid loss of CD44 from both leukocytes and synovial cells and displays an inhibitory effect on cell–extracellular matrix interactions in the synovium. As a result, the administration of such an antibody abrogates tissue swelling and leukocyte infiltration, two major components of inflammation."

It is thus a good vector for targeting protein antigens to the cellular arm of the immune response. Here we use a model system, consisting of colon and renal carcinomas that express the influenza virus nucleoprotein and a recombinant L. monocytogenes that secrets this antigen, to test the potential of this organism as a cancer immunotherapeutic agent. We show that this recombinant organism can not only protect mice against lethal challenge with tumour cells that express the antigen, but can also cause regression of established macroscopic tumours in an antigen-specific T-cell-dependent manner."

https://openalex.org/W2059383418,"Rhesus macaques were immunized with attenuated vaccinia or canarypox human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) recombinants and boosted with HIV-1 protein subunits formulated in alum. Following challenge with HIV-2SBL6669, three out of eight immunized macaques resisted infection for six months and another exhibited significantly delayed infection, whereas all three naive controls became infected. Immunizations elicited both humoral and cellular immune responses; however, no clear correlates of protection were discerned. Although more extensive studies are now called for, this first demonstration of cross-protection between HIV-1 and -2 suggests that viral variability may not be an insurmountable problem in the design of a global AIDS vaccine."

https://openalex.org/W2042639005,"For B cells to make antibodies against most antigens, they require help from T cells. T cell help is delivered as two signals to the B cell, one of which is via CD40 and the other can be through receptors for any of a variety of soluble cytokines. We have constructed recombinant vaccinia viruses that express the ligand for CD40 and have shown that the growth of these viruses is dramatically controlled in vivo, even in mice that lack T or B cells. In this paper, we also described our attempts to analyse the CD40 ligand-mediated antiviral activity by studying the clearance of these viruses in mice that are deficient in important antiviral mechanisms. Thus, the antiviral activity of CD40L may represent a surprising and potent effector mechanism of T cells activated during a virus infection."

https://openalex.org/W2018940129,Ribozymes can inhibit gene expression in a sequence-specific manner by catalysing cleavage of target messenger RNAs. They can also be used to for DIY (do-it-yourself) surgery on defective RNAs. The potential therapeutic applications of these ribozyme properties were discussed at a recent meeting.
