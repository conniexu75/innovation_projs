https://openalex.org/W2037413813,"Tree-ring data contribute to a better understanding of the nature of past climatic variations. Annual ring records several thousand years long can be constructed for a few areas, but interpretation of them requires the development of new approaches. For example, a single record of average ring width in the upper tree line environment provides a guide to past temperature fluctuations. However, comparison of this record with another, that of the arid lower forest border, from the same area permits characterization of associated precipitation and temperature anomalies that may, in turn, be linked to features of the general circulation. Other approaches that promise to be very fruitful include study of the variation of ring-width statistics through time, investigation of the physical and chemical properties of wood, and combined multivariate analysis of data for a variety of paleoclimatic indicators."

A small quake and large vapor cloud on 11 June were followed 4 hours later by a remarkable volcanic ash cloud and, after another hour, by a major explosion recorded at infrasonic stations throughout the hemisphere. Seismic activity increased to a peak on 19 June, when more than 200 events per day were recorded by a seismograph 140 km away. Several hundred quakes were in the magnitude range 4.0 to 5.4 m(b), but few such events were recorded after 23 June. Unusual lightning accompanied the major cloud, and, during the evening of 11 June, distant observers reported red glow and flashes from the area. Fine ash fell that night and much of the next day to distances at least 350 km from the volcano."

Values of V* range from 10.6 to 15.4 cubic centimeters per mole with a mean value of 13.4 cubic centimeters per mole, near that expected for oxygen ion self-diffusion. The quantity V* is incorporated into existing flow equations; in combination with observations on naturally deformed mantle xenoliths, estimates are given of the variation with depth of stress, strain rate, and viscosity."
https://openalex.org/W2066148027,"A toxin isolated from apple fruit tissue infected by Erwinia amylovora is 98 percent galactose in polymeric form, 0.375 percent protein, and has an average molecular weight of approximately 165,000. Young shoots of rosaceous, but not nonrosaceous, species wilt in a manner characteristic of the disease when placed in toxin solutions with concentrations as low as 10 micrograms per milliliter. Varieties of apple and pear susceptible to Erwinia amylovora wilt in 1 to 3 hours, whereas resistant varieties display symptoms 12 to 24 hours after treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2079992456,"Neutron scattering gives information on molecular conformations in solid solutions of polymers of one isotope in another. Results on crystals of polyethylene grown from solution show a molecular dimension (in the form of a radius of gyration) that is almost invariant with the length of the chain. It is proposed that certain lengths of folded chains fold back onto themselves to form stacks of chain-folded ribbons (""superfolding"")."
https://openalex.org/W1986820595,"Recent infrared radiometric observations of Jupiter have disclosed local temperatures in the North Equatorial Belt far in excess of those at the level of the solid ammonia clouds, and visual observations reveal an orange-brown coloration within this belt. We suggest that, in a multilayer cloud model, solar ultraviolet photolysis of hydrogen sulfide in regions where ammonia clouds are sparse or absent should lead to the production of substantial quantities of inorganic chromophores."
https://openalex.org/W4212851486,"Sediment cores from the Arctic Ocean yield significant faunal and lithologic evidence of alternating cold and milder periods for the last 6 million years. Although high-latitude continental glaciation commenced prior to 6 million years ago, the Arctic Ocean remained free of permanent pack ice up to approximately 0.7 million years ago, after which successive ice-covered and ice-free conditions existed."
https://openalex.org/W1984732234,"Aqueous films on terrestrial litter are inhabited by numerous microorganisms; the surfaces of such films are covered by monolayer-forming substances. The spreading pressure of the latter can result in transport of floating and submerged organisms to adjacent water films with clean surfaces. The clean surfaces, produced by rain or possibly dew, permit rapid vertical and horizontal dispersal of microorganisms onto newly fallen leaves and other plant materials."
https://openalex.org/W2012759676,"Exchangeable ammonium nitrogen is present in Paleocene (Fort Union) shale below a depth of 10 meters in North Dakota and eastern Montana. Above 10 meters, exchangeable ammonium nitrogen is nitrified in situ. The lack of viable nitrifying organisms and the probable lack of oxygen prevent in situ nitrification below 10 meters. Shale samples incubated at 27 degrees C under nonsterile conditions or shales exposed to atmospheric contamination exhibited active nitrification without additional treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2032472783,"A prototypical operating statement similar to that used by business firms has been shown to be a useful decision-making tool for a community choosing a solid waste management system. When applied to resource recovery, it highlights the economics of recovery and the values of the input parameters necessary to achieve economic viability, whether in the case of public or private ownership."
https://openalex.org/W2019364202,"Energy and the gross national product have grown hand in hand at 3 to 3Â½ percent a year for almost 40 years. Our energy growth is slowing down and will essentially level off in the 1990's. Our production of oil and gas passed a peak in the early 1970's, and there is no resource base to justify predictions of increased yields. Coal is the only fossil fuel capable of increased production. There are serious doubts that our uranium resources can support a large light-water reactor program. Finding rates for petroleum, natural gas, and uranium are less than half of what they were 20 years ago."
https://openalex.org/W1965199371,"It would be presumptuous to suggest that economic and technological forces will determine the course of domestic or international affairs. In the last analysis, passions rule the world. Nonetheless, to a degree perhaps unparalleled in the past, economic and technological considerations will shape the ways in which political interests and conflicts seek their expression and work themselves out. In a world where nuclear weaponry has inhibited the use of military power and where social and economic demands play an inordinate role in political life, the choice, success, or failure of a nation's technological strategy will influence in large measure its place in the international pecking order and its capacity to solve its domestic problems."
https://openalex.org/W2078557151,"Mature stage IVb Phycomyces sporangiophores show left-handed spiral growth; that is, viewed from above, the sporangium rotates clockwise. Mechanical conditioning of the cell wall by the Instron technique increases the ratio of the rotational to the elongational growth rate. This result is in agreement with the fibril reorientation model of spiral growth, which suggests that cell wall microfibrils, initially oriented in a nearly transverse right-handed direction in the upper region of the growing zone, are displaced during growth toward the longitudinal axis, causing the observed left-handed spiral growth."
