https://openalex.org/W2896103138,"The mouse embryo has long been central to the study of mammalian development; however, elucidating the cell behaviors governing gastrulation and the formation of tissues and organs remains a fundamental challenge. A major obstacle is the lack of live imaging and image analysis technologies capable of systematically following cellular dynamics across the developing embryo. We developed a light-sheet microscope that adapts itself to the dramatic changes in size, shape, and optical properties of the post-implantation mouse embryo and captures its development from gastrulation to early organogenesis at the cellular level. We furthermore developed a computational framework for reconstructing long-term cell tracks, cell divisions, dynamic fate maps, and maps of tissue morphogenesis across the entire embryo. By jointly analyzing cellular dynamics in multiple embryos registered in space and time, we built a dynamic atlas of post-implantation mouse development that, together with our microscopy and computational methods, is provided as a resource.

https://openalex.org/W2897118246,"We examined how the immune microenvironment molds tumor evolution at different metastatic organs in a longitudinal dataset of colorectal cancer. Through multiplexed analyses, we showed that clonal evolution patterns during metastatic progression depend on the immune contexture at the metastatic site. Genetic evidence of neoantigen depletion was observed in the sites with high Immunoscore and spatial proximity between Ki67+ tumor cells and CD3+ cells. The immunoedited tumor clones were eliminated and did not recur, while progressing clones were immune privileged, despite the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Characterization of immune-privileged metastases revealed tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic mechanisms of escape. The lowest recurrence risk was associated with high Immunoscore, occurrence of immunoediting, and low tumor burden. We propose a parallel selection model of metastatic progression, where branched evolution could be traced back to immune-escaping clones. The findings could inform the understanding of cancer dissemination and the development of immunotherapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2896222795,"Lung development and function arises from the interactions between diverse cell types and lineages. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we characterize the cellular composition of the lung during development and identify vast dynamics in cell composition and their molecular characteristics. Analyzing 818 ligand-receptor interaction pairs within and between cell lineages, we identify broadly interacting cells, including AT2, innate lymphocytes (ILCs), and basophils. Using interleukin (IL)-33 receptor knockout mice and in vitro experiments, we show that basophils establish a lung-specific function imprinted by IL-33 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), characterized by unique signaling of cytokines and growth factors important for stromal, epithelial, and myeloid cell fates. Antibody-depletion strategies, diphtheria toxin-mediated selective depletion of basophils, and co-culture studies show that lung resident basophils are important regulators of alveolar macrophage development and function. Together, our study demonstrates how whole-tissue signaling interaction map on the single-cell level can broaden our understanding of cellular networks in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2897200459,"Full-length spliced RNA isoforms are identified in thousands of single cerebellar cells. Full-length RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has been applied to bulk tissue, cell lines and sorted cells to characterize transcriptomes1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, but applying this technology to single cells has proven to be difficult, with less than ten single-cell transcriptomes having been analyzed thus far12,13. Although single splicing events have been described for ≤200 single cells with statistical confidence14,15, full-length mRNA analyses for hundreds of cells have not been reported. Single-cell short-read 3′ sequencing enables the identification of cellular subtypes16,17,18,19,20,21, but full-length mRNA isoforms for these cell types cannot be profiled. We developed a method that starts with bulk tissue and identifies single-cell types and their full-length RNA isoforms without fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Using single-cell isoform RNA-Seq (ScISOr-Seq), we identified RNA isoforms in neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and cell subtypes such as Purkinje and Granule cells, and cell-type-specific combination patterns of distant splice sites6,7,8,9,22,23. We used ScISOr-Seq to improve genome annotation in mouse Gencode version 10 by determining the cell-type-specific expression of 18,173 known and 16,872 novel isoforms."

The CRISPR-GO system offers a programmable platform to investigate large-scale spatial genome organization and function. The 3-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome within the nucleus plays a central role in regulating gene expression and cellular function during development and in disease (Bickmore, 2013Bickmore W.A.

For example, genes that localize at the nuclear periphery exhibit low transcription, while those that localize to the nuclear interior often have higher activity (van Steensel and Belmont, 2017van Steensel B. Belmont A.S. Lamina-Associated Domains: Links with Chromosome Architecture, Heterochromatin, and Gene Repression.Cell. 2017; 169: 780-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). During lymphocyte development, the immunoglobulin loci at the nuclear periphery in progenitor cells relocate to the nuclear interior in pro-B cells, a process that is synchronous with immunoglobulin activation and rearrangement (Kosak et al., 2002Kosak S.T. Skok J.A. Medina K.L. Riblet R. Le Beau M.M. Fisher A.G. Singh H. Subnuclear compartmentalization of immunoglobulin loci during lymphocyte development.Science. 2002; 296: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Similarly, the gene locus of proneural transcription factor Ascl1/Mash1 at the nuclear periphery of embryonic stem cells relocates to the nuclear interior of differentiated neurons (Williams et al., 2006Williams R.R. Azuara V. Perry P. Sauer S. Dvorkina M. Jørgensen H. Roix J. McQueen P. Misteli T. Merkenschlager M. Fisher A.G. Neural induction promotes large-scale chromatin reorganisation of the Mash1 locus.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Membraneless nuclear bodies are important for proper genome organization and cellular function (Mao et al., 2011Mao Y.S. Zhang B. Spector D.L. Biogenesis and function of nuclear bodies.Trends Genet. 2011; 27: 295-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). For example, Cajal bodies (CBs), which have been implicated in small nuclear RNA (snRNA) biogenesis, ribonucleoprotein assembly, and telomerase biogenesis, are essential for vertebrate embryogenesis and are also abundant in tumor cells and neurons (Gall, 2000Gall J.G. Cajal bodies: the first 100 years.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 273-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies are also associated with tumorigenesis and antiviral infection (Reineke and Kao, 2009Reineke E.L. Kao H.Y. Targeting promyelocytic leukemia protein: a means to regulating PML nuclear bodies.Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2009; 5: 366-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the relationship between nuclear body/chromatin colocalization and gene expression remains poorly understood. Our ability to study the causal relationship between 3D genome structure and gene expression is constrained by currently available methods. Microscopic imaging (e.g., fluorescent in situ hybridization, FISH) and chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based techniques have profiled changes in chromatin positioning and interactions during development and disease processes, providing valuable correlative information (Dekker et al., 2002Dekker J.

However, they often cannot establish causal links between genome organization and function. Methods based on LacI-LacO interactions have been exploited to mediate targeted genomic reorganization. This technique utilizes an array of LacO repeats inserted into a genomic locus, which is recruited to the nuclear periphery using LacI fused to a nuclear membrane protein (Finlan et al., 2008Finlan L.E. Sproul D. Thomson I. Boyle S. Kerr E. Perry P. Ylstra B. Chubb J.R. Bickmore W.A.

Transcriptional repression mediated by repositioning of genes to the nuclear lamina.Nature. 2008; 452: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Using this technique, repositioning genes to the nuclear periphery leads to gene repression (Finlan et al., 2008Finlan L.E. Sproul D. Thomson I. Boyle S. Kerr E. Perry P. Ylstra B. Chubb J.R. Bickmore W.A. Recruitment to the nuclear periphery can alter expression of genes in human cells.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000039Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, Reddy et al., 2008Reddy K.L.

However, for this approach, creating a stable LacO repeat-containing cell line is a prerequisite, which involves multiple steps, including random insertion of a large LacO repeat array into the genome, screening for stable cell lines containing a single insertion locus, and characterization of the genomic insertion site. New tools are needed for programmable control of the spatial genome organization. Prokaryotic class II CRISPR-Cas systems have been repurposed as a toolbox for gene editing, gene regulation, epigenome editing, chromatin looping, and live-cell genome imaging (Barrangou et al., 2007Barrangou R.

It remains unknown whether the CRISPR-Cas system can be used to mediate spatial genome organization and manipulate genomic interactions with nuclear compartments. We developed a versatile system for programmable 3D genome organization, named CRISPR-genome organizer (CRISPR-GO), by coupling the CRISPR-dCas9 system with nuclear-compartment-specific proteins via ligand-mediated dimerization (Figure 1A). We showed that CRISPR-GO allowed for efficient, inducible, and dynamic repositioning of specific genomic loci to the nuclear periphery, Cajal bodies, and PML bodies. CRISPR-GO can be programmed to flexibly target different genomic sequences. By combining CRISPR-GO with live-cell CRISPR-Cas9 imaging, we were able to interrogate the real-time dynamics of chromatin interactions with nuclear compartments. Targeting genomic loci to the nuclear periphery or to Cajal bodies repressed proximal reporter gene expression. Importantly, colocalization of genomic loci with Cajal bodies repressed distal (30–600 kb) endogenous gene expression. The CRISPR-GO system offers a useful technology to study the relationship between macroscale (∼μm) spatial genome organization and cellular function, distinct from previous uses of CRISPR for gene editing and local gene regulation. To implement an inducible CRISPR-mediated chromatin repositioning system, we first tested two chemical-inducible heterodimerization systems: an abscisic acid (ABA) inducible ABI/PYL1 system (Gao et al., 2016Gao Y. Xiong X. Wong S. Charles E.J. Lim W.A. Qi L.S. Complex transcriptional modulation with orthogonal and inducible dCas9 regulators.Nat. Methods. 2016; 13: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, Liang et al., 2011Liang F.S. Ho W.Q. Crabtree G.R. Engineering the ABA plant stress pathway for regulation of induced proximity.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: rs2Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and a Trimethoprim-Haloligand (TMP-Htag) inducible DHFR/HaloTag system (Ballister et al., 2014Ballister E.R. Aonbangkhen C. Mayo A.M. Lampson M.A. Chenoweth D.M. Localized light-induced protein dimerization in living cells using a photocaged dimerizer.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 5475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For both systems, we fused the Streptococcus pyogenes dCas9 (D10A & H840A) protein to one heterodimer, and an inner nuclear envelope (NE) protein, Emerin to the cognate heterodimer (Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B). Emerin is inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) after synthesis, and then translocated to the NE through diffusion within the contiguous ER/NE membranes (Berk et al., 2013Berk J.M. Tifft K.E. Wilson K.L. The nuclear envelope LEM-domain protein emerin.Nucleus. 2013; 4: 298-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We created U2OS human bone osteosarcoma cell lines that stably expressed each dimerization system. Addition of ABA caused efficient dimerization-induced re-localization of ABI-BFP-dCas9 protein from the nuclear interior to the NE and ER (Figures S1C and S1D), but the TMP-Htag inducible system showed no evident re-localization effects (data not shown). Therefore, we used the ABA-inducible ABI/PYL1 system for later experiments. To test if the ABA-inducible CRISPR-GO system was able to alter the position of chromosomes, we introduced an sgRNA that targets a highly repetitive (>100x) endogenous region within Chromosome 3q29 (Chr3q29) (Ma et al., 2016Ma H. Tu L.C. Naseri A. Huisman M. Zhang S. Grunwald D. Pederson T. Multiplexed labeling of genomic loci with dCas9 and engineered sgRNAs using CRISPRainbow.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) (Figures 1C and S2A, Table S1). To visualize the position of the targeted Chr3 locus, we added an independent CRISPR-Cas9 imaging component, a dCas9-HaloTag fusion protein, which binds to the JF549-HaloTag dye (Figure S1C) (Chen et al., 2013Chen B. Gilbert L.A. Cimini B.A. Schnitzbauer J. Zhang W. Li G.W. Park J. Blackburn E.H. Weissman J.S. Qi L.S. Huang B.

We confirmed that, in the absence of sgRNA, the localization of dCas9-HaloTag was unaffected by the ABA treatment (Figure S1D). The Chr3 sgRNA mediates both CRISPR-Cas9 imaging (via dCas9-HaloTag) and CRISPR-GO genomic re-localization (via ABI-dCas9) by targeting multiple repeats within the same Chr3 region. After 2 days of ABA treatment, the percentage of Chr3 loci that localized to the nuclear periphery increased from 19% to 87%, and the percentage of cells with periphery loci (i.e., cells showing at least one locus localized to the nuclear periphery) increased from 27% to 95% (Figures 1C, 1G, S3A, and S3B). CRISPR-GO is efficient in repositioning highly repetitive endogenous genomic loci in human cells.Figure S3Re-localization of Genomic Loci to Nuclear Periphery by the CRISPR-GO System, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A) Individual channels of representative microscopic images in Figure 1G comparing the localization of targeted genomic loci (red, arrows) and nuclear periphery (green, dotted lines) with or without ABA.

Similarly, using a telomere-targeting sgRNA, the percentage of periphery-localized telomeres increased from 26% to 65% (Figure 1C, Videos S1 and S2). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIxN2U1NzY4YWIxNTEwYWYzY2NjMjc0ODAzNWM1ZDUxYiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NjA0ODIzfQ.d2tMow_ggiL1f0z5C2pkiuoI9ziVIFGsBa78Yy7Siznqw0Qo-CTHa5GEK8H6Bs1JOJng3zsgSE8k3KkNMxikZJvgpeUy3UDZ87nM_Z4U_c9gAnzIxfeHgkaLFIipY7mqf8oEjawTBupRpfHOvIunGgdAazfJpQsKhmK1bCr4ri7XHqSrAHH-CcGF09093MbPewOwJQ5_WYmWX_OZ3ce71lFcTata5jM7hn3ACFxiplTM6S2TrmtmfArSq3-weA_tsP1QF90y0zLCP-WMakanv2ezRdOFiNra7Je5tQNlMBdiEy5wc7RRFZGItfneW6lR-eziDvrracH4jJSvAfP5Nw Download .mp4 (7.94 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. 3D Visualization of a Representative Control Cell Showing that Telomeres Are Mostly Not Affiliated with the Nuclear Envelope during Interphase, Related to Figure 5DTelomeres are labeled by TRF1-mCherry shown in red.

Green shows PYL-GFP-Emerin that localizes to the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum. The movie starts with raw data and then switches to a built model based on the raw data. Telomere spots (red dots) were built using the spot functions and the nuclear envelope surface (green surface) was built using the cell function and the surface function of Imaris software. We also targeted a LacO array located at chromosome 1p36 in a U2OS 2-6-3 reporter cell line (Figure S2A) (Kumaran and Spector, 2008Kumaran R.I. Spector D.L. A genetic locus targeted to the nuclear periphery in living cells maintains its transcriptional competence.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Based on CRISPR imaging, the percentage of periphery loci increased from 4% to 60%, and the percentage of cells with periphery loci increased from 4.5% to 65% after ABA treatment (Figures 1C and 1G), which was also confirmed by FISH (Figure S3C). Next, we utilized 3D-FISH analysis to test the efficiency of the CRISPR-GO system to reposition less repetitive (<100 repeats) sequences. We chose to target a genomic region on Chr7q36.3 containing ∼71 sgRNA-targetable repeats and a region on ChrXp21.2 containing ∼15 repeats (Figure S2B). After ABA treatment, the percentage of periphery-localized loci increased from 28% to 68% for Chr7 and from 33% to 62% for ChrX. The percentage of cells with periphery loci increased from 32% to 79% for Chr7 and from 41% to 76% for ChrX (Figures 1D and 1H). When using a non-targeting sgRNA as a control, the percentages of periphery loci remained unchanged after ABA treatment (Figure S3D). These results suggest that our CRISPR-GO system is efficient in repositioning highly repetitive and less repetitive sequences to the nuclear periphery. While repetitive sequences are abundantly present in the human genome, we asked if the CRISPR-GO system also enabled repositioning of non-repetitive genomic loci. We first chose to target the non-repetitive XIST gene located at ChrXq13.2 and designed 13 sgRNAs spanning the XIST genomic region (Figure S2C, Table S2). With ABA treatment, the percentage of periphery-localized XIST loci increased from 39% to 79%, and the percentage of cells with periphery loci increased from 59% to 90% (Figures 1E and 1H). By using a pool of 9 sgRNAs targeting regions adjacent to and within the PTEN gene on Chr10 (Figure S2C, Table S2), the CRISPR-GO system increased the percentage of periphery localized PTEN loci from 39% to 61% and the percentage of cells from 62% to 88% (Figures 1E and 1H). We also tested whether a single sgRNA targeting a non-repetitive region was sufficient to re-reposition a genomic locus. Using a single sgRNA targeting the CXCR4 locus at Chr2, the percentage of periphery localized CXCR4 loci increased from 20% to 50% (sgCXCR4-1) or from 25% to 47% (sgCXCR4-2). The percentage of cells with periphery loci increased from 52% to 85% (sgCXCR4-1) or from 49% to 82% (sgCXCR4-2) (Figures 1F and S2C, Table S2). When using a pool of 6 sgRNAs, the CRISPR-GO system increased the percentage of periphery CXCR4 loci from 32% to 62%, and the percentage of cells from 46% to 90%, respectively (Figures 1F and 1H). In the non-targeting sgRNA control group, the percentage of periphery CXCR4 loci remained unchanged after ABA treatment (Figure S3D). These results together suggested that the CRISPR-GO system can mediate efficient relocalization of non-repetitive loci to the nuclear periphery. One advantage of the CRISPR-GO system is its ability to easily switch on or off genomic re-positioning by adding or removing a chemical inducer. We performed chemical induction and removal experiments to study the system’s dynamics and reversibility (Figure 2A). ABA-induced genomic re-localization occurred relatively quickly, as the percentage of periphery Chr3 loci increased from 19% (n = 142) to 75% (n = 93, p < 0.0001) within 16 hr of ABA addition and reached 91% (n = 160) after 72 hr. After ABA removal, the percentage of periphery Chr3 loci decreased from 82% (n = 163) to 45% (n = 84, p < 0.0001) after 24 hr and further decreased to 27% (n = 146) and 26% (n = 159) after 48 hr and 72 hr, respectively. After 48 hr of ABA removal, the percentage of periphery Chr3 was indistinguishable from an untreated sample (25%, n = 106, p = 0.77). These results suggest that nuclear repositioning mediated by the CRISPR-GO system can be easily switched on and off by adding or removing the ABA chemical inducer. Previous work using the LacO-LacI system found that tethering of the LacO locus to the nuclear periphery is mitosis dependent (Kumaran and Spector, 2008Kumaran R.I. Spector D.L. A genetic locus targeted to the nuclear periphery in living cells maintains its transcriptional competence.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). We re-visited this question using the CRISPR-GO system to target the endogenous Chr3 locus. CRISPR-GO cells containing Chr3-targeting sgRNAs were synchronized and arrested at S phase by Hydroxyurea (HU) treatment and then treated with ABA (Figure 2B). Interestingly, after 24 hr of ABA treatmen"

We developed a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) approach to systematically identify regulators of neuronal-fate specification. We activated expression of all endogenous transcription factors and other regulators via a pooled CRISPRa screen in embryonic stem cells, revealing genes including epigenetic regulators such as Ezh2 that can induce neuronal fate. Systematic CRISPR-based activation of factor pairs allowed us to generate a genetic interaction map for neuronal differentiation, with confirmation of top individual and combinatorial hits as bona fide inducers of neuronal fate. Several factor pairs could directly reprogram fibroblasts into neurons, which shared similar transcriptional programs with endogenous neurons. This study provides an unbiased discovery approach for systematic identification of genes that drive cell-fate acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W2896362483,"Decreased hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony may mediate cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, but it remains unclear which cells orchestrate this long-range synchrony. Parvalbumin (PV)- and somatostatin (SOM)-expressing interneurons show histological abnormalities in individuals with schizophrenia and are hypothesized to regulate oscillatory synchrony within the prefrontal cortex. To examine the relationship between interneuron function, long-range hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony, and cognition, we optogenetically inhibited SOM and PV neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice performing a spatial working memory task while simultaneously recording neural activity in the mPFC and the hippocampus (HPC). We found that inhibiting SOM, but not PV, interneurons during the encoding phase of the task impaired working memory accuracy. This behavioral impairment was associated with decreased hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony and impaired spatial encoding in mPFC neurons. These findings suggest that interneuron dysfunction may contribute to cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia by disrupting long-range synchrony between the HPC and PFC."

We present Athena, a de novo assembler that uses read clouds to improve metagenomic assemblies. We applied this approach to sequence stool samples from two healthy individuals and compared it with existing short-read and synthetic long-read metagenomic sequencing techniques. Read-cloud metagenomic sequencing and Athena assembly produced the most comprehensive individual genome drafts with high contiguity (>200-kb N50, fewer than ten contigs), even for bacteria with relatively low (20×) raw short-read-sequence coverage. We also sequenced a complex marine-sediment sample and generated 24 intermediate-quality genome drafts (>70% complete, <10% contaminated), nine of which were complete (>90% complete, <5% contaminated).

https://openalex.org/W2897051671,"Synaptic transmission is bioenergetically demanding, and the diverse processes underlying synaptic plasticity elevate these demands. Therefore, mitochondrial functions, including ATP synthesis and Ca2+ handling, are likely essential for plasticity. Although axonal mitochondria have been extensively analyzed, LTP is predominantly induced postsynaptically, where mitochondria are understudied. Additionally, though mitochondrial fission is essential for their function, signaling pathways that regulate fission in neurons remain poorly understood. We found that NMDAR-dependent LTP induction prompted a rapid burst of dendritic mitochondrial fission and elevations of mitochondrial matrix Ca2+. The fission burst was triggered by cytosolic Ca2+ elevation and required CaMKII, actin, and Drp1, as well as dynamin 2. Preventing fission impaired mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ elevations, structural LTP in cultured neurons, and electrophysiological LTP in hippocampal slices. These data illustrate a novel pathway whereby synaptic activity controls mitochondrial fission and show that dynamic control of fission regulates plasticity induction, perhaps by modulating mitochondrial Ca2+ handling."

Thus, interareal gamma synchronization occurs at the optimal phase relation for transmission of sensory inputs to motor responses. At the heart of many cognitive functions is the dynamic modulation of effective connectivity, i.e., the context-dependent modulation of the postsynaptic effect of a given neuronal group. The effect of a group of neurons can be enhanced when they engage in gamma-band synchronization, because this renders their inputs to postsynaptic target neurons coincident in time (Azouz and Gray, 2003Azouz R.

Indeed, groups of visual cortical neurons show enhanced local gamma-band synchronization when they process attended as compared with ignored stimuli (Bichot et al., 2005Bichot N.P. Rossi A.F.

Gamma-band synchronization in visual cortex predicts speed of change detection.Nature. 2006; 439: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Thus, effective connectivity depends on synchronization among presynaptic neurons. Importantly, effective connectivity also depends on the synchronization between pre- and postsynaptic neurons. When postsynaptic neurons are synchronized, this modulates their gain rhythmically, and inputs are most effective when they consistently arrive during high gain. Thus, good neuronal communication requires coherence between pre- and postsynaptic neurons, a concept referred to as “Communication through Coherence” (CTC) (Akam and Kullmann, 2010Akam T.

Indeed, gamma phase relations between neuronal groups affect their power-power correlation (Womelsdorf et al., 2007Womelsdorf T. Schoffelen J.M. Oostenveld R. Singer W. Desimone R. Engel A.K. Fries P. Modulation of neuronal interactions through neuronal synchronization.Science. 2007; 316: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) and their transfer entropy (Besserve et al., 2015Besserve M.

Shifts of gamma phase across primary visual cortical sites reflect dynamic stimulus-modulated information transfer.PLoS Biol. 2015; 13: e1002257Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Importantly, this mechanism might serve a functional role for selective attention. When two visual stimuli induce two local gamma rhythms in macaque V1, only the gamma rhythm induced by the attended stimulus establishes coherence to V4 (Bosman et al., 2012Bosman C.A. Schoffelen J.M. Brunet N. Oostenveld R. Bastos A.M. Womelsdorf T. Rubehn B. Stieglitz T. De Weerd P. Fries P.

Whether interareal coherence can, in fact, affect interareal communication according to the CTC mechanism, depends on whether the postsynaptic gamma rhythm modulates the gain of spike responses. One study investigated whether a spike in V1 is followed by a spike in V2 and found this spike transmission to be modulated by the gamma phase in V2 (Jia et al., 2013Jia X. Tanabe S. Kohn A. Gamma and the coordination of spiking activity in early visual cortex.Neuron. 2013; 77: 762-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Another recent study showed that visually induced gamma in V4 rhythmically modulates the gain of spike responses and also behavioral reaction times (Ni et al., 2016Ni J. Wunderle T. Lewis C.M. Desimone R. Diester I. Fries P. Gamma-rhythmic gain modulation.Neuron. 2016; 92: 240-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similar effects have been described for gamma frequency rhythms that were optogenetically entrained in the rodent somatosensory cortex (Cardin et al., 2009Cardin J.A. Carlén M. Meletis K. Knoblich U. Zhang F. Deisseroth K. Tsai L.H. Moore C.I. Driving fast-spiking cells induces gamma rhythm and controls sensory responses.Nature. 2009; 459: 663-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar, Siegle et al., 2014Siegle J.H. Pritchett D.L. Moore C.I. Gamma-range synchronization of fast-spiking interneurons can enhance detection of tactile stimuli.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, several studies have shown that postsynaptic gamma rhythmically modulates gain. However, it remains to be shown that pre- and postsynaptic neurons engage in coherence at the phase relation that actually improves communication. The mentioned studies on gamma rhythmic gain modulation do not show that presynaptic activity is coherent at such a phase relation that inputs are timed to moments of maximal postsynaptic gain. The mentioned studies on selective attention effects report enhanced coherence, i.e., an enhanced consistency of phase relations. However, although consistent phase relations are necessary for good communication, they are not sufficient. A consistent phase relation could as well consistently time inputs to postsynaptic phases of low gain. For CTC to mediate selective attention, phase relations need to be not merely consistent, but they need to be consistent at the optimal phase relation (Akam and Kullmann, 2010Akam T. Kullmann D.M. Oscillations and filtering networks support flexible routing of information.Neuron. 2010; 67: 308-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, Fries, 2005Fries P. A mechanism for cognitive dynamics: neuronal communication through neuronal coherence.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2005; 9: 474-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). Thus, one of the most important requirements of CTC has yet to receive empirical support. Therefore, we set out to test whether interareal gamma synchronization actually occurs at the optimal phase relation for communication and, thereby, improves behavioral performance. We investigated simultaneous V1-V4 recordings in macaques performing a selective visual attention task to test whether transmission of a stimulus change to a behavioral response depends on the V1-V4 phase relation. Because the stimulus change is timed randomly, it is independent of ongoing neuronal activity and provides an ideal probe for the efficiency of transmission. Furthermore, the analysis relates interareal synchronization directly to behavioral responses, thereby directly probing its behavioral relevance. We first describe that fast responses are preceded by enhanced V1-V4 gamma-band synchronization. We then show that interareal gamma phase relations just before the stimulus change predict the speed at which the change is transformed into a behavioral response. Most importantly, the analysis shows that the phase relation at which V1 and V4 synchronize is optimal for stimulus transmission. Synchronization entails that the distribution of phase relations is non-uniform and centered around a mean phase relation, i.e., the mean phase relation is the phase relation of synchronization. We show that, when the gamma phase relation on a given trial deviates from this phase relation of synchronization, the subsequent behavioral response is systematically slowed. We intended to investigate the relation between interareal synchronization and behavior. To this end, we focused on neuronal activity preceding the behaviorally relevant stimulus event and related it to the subsequent reaction time in response to the event. The relevant stimulus event was a shape change of a cued drifting grating. The cued grating and an un-cued grating were simultaneously presented in opposite hemifields, while monkeys kept fixation and attentionally monitored the cued grating (Figure 1). During stimulus presentation and task performance, we recorded neuronal activity simultaneously from areas V1 and V4. Both areas were covered with an electrocorticographic (ECoG) grid (see STAR Methods for details). Trials with attention to the stimulus contralateral to the ECoG are referred to as “attend-IN” and trials with attention ipsilateral to the ECoG as “attend-OUT.” Unless otherwise noted, the analysis focuses on the 200 ms immediately preceding the change of the attended stimulus and uses the corresponding reaction times (RTs). Visual stimulation induced gamma-band activities in retinotopically corresponding parts of V1 and V4 (Figures 2A and 2B ; Lewis et al., 2016bLewis C.M. Bosman C.A. Womelsdorf T. Fries P. Stimulus-induced visual cortical networks are recapitulated by spontaneous local and interareal synchronization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: E606-E615Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For further analysis, we selected, per monkey, the visually driven recording sites, which were defined as the top third of sites with the strongest visually induced gamma-band activity (see STAR Methods for details). The spectra of stimulation-induced local field potential (LFP) power changes showed clear gamma-band peaks for both V1 (Figures 2C and 2D) and V4 (Figures 2E and 2F), with particularly strong power increases in V1. The gamma rhythms in V1 and V4 showed interareal synchronization, as evidenced by the spectra of pairwise phase consistency (PPC) (Figures 2G and 2H; in this and the following analyses of interareal synchronization, n = 140 interareal site pairs and n = 2,550 trials). For further analysis, we determined the individual gamma peak frequency for each monkey separately (see STAR Methods for details). Spectra of local power changes and of interareal coherence agreed largely but not perfectly in peak frequency, as observed in previous studies of interareal synchronization (Bosman et al., 2012Bosman C.A. Schoffelen J.M. Brunet N. Oostenveld R. Bastos A.M. Womelsdorf T. Rubehn B. Stieglitz T. De Weerd P. Fries P.

Gotts S.J. Zhou H. Desimone R. High-frequency, long-range coupling between prefrontal and visual cortex during attention.Science. 2009; 324: 1207-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). This corresponds to the predictions of the theory of weakly coupled oscillators, which also applies to the synchronization among cortical gamma rhythms (Lowet et al., 2017Lowet E. Roberts M.J. Peter A. Gips B. De Weerd P. A quantitative theory of gamma synchronization in macaque V1.eLife. 2017; 6: e26642Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because our focus was on investigating whether interareal synchronization is predictive of behavior, we determined the individual gamma peak frequency by fitting a Gaussian to the PPC spectrum. The gamma peak frequency was 74 Hz in monkey K and 63 Hz in monkey P. This is in agreement with previous studies showing inter-individual variability in gamma peak frequency (van Pelt et al., 2012van Pelt S. Boomsma D.I. Fries P. Magnetoencephalography in twins reveals a strong genetic determination of the peak frequency of visually induced gamma-band synchronization.J.

Gamma-phase shifting in awake monkey visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Note that the V1-V4 PPC spectra also showed peaks in the beta band (16 Hz in monkey K and 14 Hz in monkey P). We investigate those beta peaks separately below. As a first approach to test for a putative relation between interareal gamma-band synchronization and behavior, we performed a median split of the trials according to RTs. Note that RTs did not differ between attend-IN and attend-OUT (p = 0.18; Figure S1). For fast and slow trials, we separately calculated the V1-V4 PPC in a 200 ms window immediately preceding the stimulus change. To combine results from both monkeys, PPC spectra were aligned to the individual gamma peak frequencies. V1-V4 PPC was stronger during the attend-IN compared with the attend-OUT condition (compare Figures 3A and 3B ; p < 0.05, 2 × 2 ANOVA with factors ATTENTION [attend-IN versus attend-OUT] and REACTION TIME [RT-fast versus RT-slow]). This is consistent with previous findings of increased interareal coherence with attention (Bosman et al., 2012Bosman C.A. Schoffelen J.M. Brunet N. Oostenveld R. Bastos A.M. Womelsdorf T. Rubehn B.

Importantly, V1-V4 gamma PPC was 77% stronger preceding short compared with long RTs (Figure 3A; p < 0.05, non-parametric randomization test with correction for multiple comparisons across frequencies). When RTs were split into quartiles, this revealed a systematic increase in V1-V4 gamma PPC, with a 125% increase between longest and shortest RTs (Figure S2A). These effects were absent for the attend-OUT condition (Figure 3B; Figure S2B), when monkeys reported changes in the ipsilateral stimulus and, thereby, the observed RTs related to the stimulus not processed by the recorded neurons. Thus, the RT-related effect of gamma synchronization is specific to the V1-V4 area pair that is actually involved in the communication of the behaviorally relevant stimulus, and the effect is not due to fluctuations in overall arousal. The RT-related effect was furthermore specific in time to the period just before and around the stimulus change. The time-resolved PPC analysis during attend-IN revealed a start of the effect around 300 ms before the stimulus change and an end around 100 ms after the stimulus change (Figure 3C). The absence of an effect during attend-OUT was confirmed in the time-resolved analysis (Figure 3D). As noted above, V1-V4 PPC spectra also showed a peak in the beta band. Therefore, we compared interareal beta phase locking between trials with fast and slow RTs (after alignment to the individual beta peak frequencies), but this did not reveal any significant differences (Figure S3; non-parametric randomization test with correction for multiple comparisons across frequencies). To test whether interareal gamma-band synchronization is predictive of behavior, we determined the gamma-band phase relation immediately preceding the stimulus change and investigated whether it systematically related to the subsequent behavioral RT. We calculated the V1-V4 gamma phase relation for the 200 ms window immediately preceding each stimulus change. Based on those phase relations, we sorted trials into 36 bins and averaged RTs per bin. Figure 4A shows the result of this analysis for an example site pair during attend-IN and suggests a systematic dependence. In contrast, Figure 4B shows the analysis for the same pair during attend-OUT and suggests a much weaker or no effect. To quantify the effect, we calculated the circular-linear correlation (Berens, 2009Berens P. CircStat: A MATLAB Toolbox for Circular Statistics.J. Stat. Softw. 2009; 31: 1-21Crossref Google Scholar) between interareal phase relations and RTs, across trials and without binning, thereby reflecting the true trial-by-trial correlation coefficient (Richter et al., 2015Richter C.G. Thompson W.H. Bosman C.A. Fries P.

Thompson W.H. Bosman C.A. Fries P. Top-down beta enhances bottom-up gamma.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 6698-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The red line in Figure 4C shows the correlation coefficient averaged over all interareal site pairs and both monkeys during attend-IN as a function of frequency, and reveals a significant correlation in the gamma-band range (p < 0.05, non-parametric randomization test corrected for multiple comparisons across frequencies). When we repeated the same analysis for the attend-OUT condition, the correlation was absent. The correlation analysis captures any linear correlation between the phase relation and RT, irrespective of the actual phase relations related to minimal and maximal RTs, respectively. Thus, the significant correlation reveals that gamma phase relations are predictive of RTs in the average across interareal site pairs. But the phase relations leading to minimal RTs could differ across site pairs, and even if they were consistent, the phase relation leading to minimal RTs could take some arbitrary and hard-to-interpret value. Therefore, as a next step, we aimed to test the specific hypothesis that the phase relation at which interareal site pairs synchronized is followed by the shortest RTs. Synchronization entails that site pairs spend relatively more time in a particular phase relation (Lowet et al., 2017Lowet E. Roberts M.J. Peter A. Gips B. De Weerd P. A quantitative theory of gamma synchronization in macaque V1.eLife. 2017; 6: e26642Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, the phase relation of synchronization is the mean phase relation. Thus, we hypothesized that the mean phase relation is followed by the shortest RTs, and that deviations from this mean phase relation are followed by longer RTs. Note that the raw phase relation between a given V1-V4 site pair cannot be directly interpreted, because the absolute LFP phase depends on numerous accidental factors, like the geometric relationship between source and electrode, and, additionally, the bipolar derivation used to remove the common recording reference incurs arbitrary phase rotations. However, irrespective of this, the mean phase relation reflects the phase relation of synchronization, and the phase relation in each trial can be expressed in terms of its deviation from this mean phase relation. Figures 5A–5D illustrate, for the example site pair from Figures 4A and 4B, how we tested the hypothesis. We calculated the mean gamma phase relation over trials (weighted by the cross-spectral power per trial) and named it the “good” phase relation (indicated by the yellow lines in Figures 5A and 5C). RTs on a given trial should be predicted by the degree of deviation from this good phase relation. We rotated all phase relations by a fixed phase so that the mean phase relation was at zero (Figure 5A was rotated into Figure 5C). We binned trials according to their phase relation and averaged RTs per bin (Figure 5B). After applying the same rotation (Figure 5B was rotated into Figure 5D), this revealed that phase relations close to the mean were indeed followed by particularly short RTs. We applied the same analysis steps to all interareal site pairs, and this confirmed the effect in the population of site pairs during attend-IN (Figure 5E and red line in Figure 5F). During attend-OUT, this relation was much weaker or absent (blue line in Figure 5F). We quantified the observed relation between the deviation from the mean phase relation and RT. We took, for each trial, the cosine of the phase relation deviation as a metric of that trial’s “goodness of phase relation” (GPR). A GPR of one (minus one) indicates a good (bad) gamma phase relation (Figure 5E). The GPR is a linear (rather than a circular) metric, which allowed us to calculate a linear correlation between single-trial GPR and RT values. We found a negative correlation between GPR and RTs, showing that good phase relations were followed by short RTs. This negative correlation occurred specifically in the gamma-band during the attend-IN condition but not the attend-OUT condition (Figure 5G; p < 0.05, non-parametric randomization test corrected for multiple comparisons across frequencies). The average correlation coefficient between GPR and RT was significant but relatively small, with a peak at r = −0.027. Note that this average is composed of correlation values calculated across single trials and for individual V1-V4 site pairs, i.e., between relatively noisy GPR and RT estimates. We found that, across V1-V4 site pairs, the correlation between GPRs and RTs was itself correlated with the strength of V1-V4 PPC (r = −0.225, p < 0.004; calculated at gamma peak frequency for attend-IN; the negative value reflects the negative GPR × RT correlation). This suggests that the trial-by-trial gamma phase relations of the interareal site pairs showing strong coherence for a given stimulus have a strong influence on the communication of that stimulus and, thereby, explain a substantial fraction of RT variability. The gamma phase relations of pairs with weaker coherence contribute less to communication or potentially show less coherence and RT modulation because of lower signal-to-noise recordings. To reduce the effect of noise, we first averaged GPR values over all site pairs per trial. This strengthened the average correlation between GPR and RT from −0.027 to −0.081, i.e., by a factor of three (Figure S4). To further reduce the effect of noise, we binned GPRs, averaged GPRs and corresponding RTs per bin, and then calculated the correlation between GPR and RT across bins (Figure S4). With 25 bins, the correlation strengthened to a value of −0.33, i.e., by a factor of ≈12 from the original value. Note that this latter approach of averaging per bin removes noise irrespective of whether this noise is accidental, like measurement noise, or whether it is genuine, reflecting a genuinely weak correlation (Richter et al., 2015Richter C.G.

Thompson W.H. Bosman C.A. Fries P. Top-down beta enhances bottom-up gamma.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 6698-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The calculation of the correlation coefficient entails division by the variances of the correlated variables. Thereby, the correlation values are strongly affected by noise in either one of the two variables. This source of underestimation should be absent for the size of the RT modulation, i.e., the RT difference between the best and the worst gamma phase relation. To estimate this RT modulation, we fitted RT as a function of GPR (both estimated per trial) with a linear regression. The resulting slope revealed that best GPRs were followed by ≈13 ms shorter RTs than worst GPRs (p = 0.002). Conventional linear regression underestimates the slope, because it minimizes residuals only for the dependent variable, while assuming that the independent variable is observed or controlled without noise. In our case, the independent variable is the GPR, and its measurement is certainly noisy. This can be addressed by using a so-called model 2 standardized major axis (SMA) linear regression (Smith, 2009Smith R.J. Use and misuse of the reduced major axis for line-fitting.Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 2009; 140: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, Warton et al., 2006Warton D.I. Wright I.J. Falster D.S. Westoby M. Bivariate line-fitting methods for allometry.Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 2006; 81: 259-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). SMA linear regression minimizes residuals for both the dependent and the independent variable. For the SMA regression, we binned the data per monkey (into 25 equally spaced non-overlapping bins, ensuring uniform distribution of the independent variable) and averaged data over monkeys per bin. We confirmed on those binned data that the conventional linear regression remained significant and had a similar slope as before binning, giving an RT difference estimate of ≈13 ms (solid line in Figure 6A; p = 0.033). The significance of the conventional linear regression justified the fitting of the SMA linear regression, which revealed an RT difference between best and worst GPRs of ≈31 ms (dashed line in Figure 6A). Finally, in a model-free approach, we compared RTs between trials with the top versus the bottom 5% GPR values and found a difference of ≈24 ms (Figure 6B, red bar; p = 0.007). These effects were absent under the attend-OUT condition: GPR was not correlated with subsequent RTs (p = 0.878), which, correspondingly, did not allow the fitting of an SMR linear regression, and RTs did not differ between trials with top versus bottom GPRs (Figure 6B, blue bar; p = 0.503). Finally, we investigated to which degree the RT-predictive effect is specific to the V1-V4 gamma phase relation rather than the gamma power in V1 or V4.

However, two major arguments were raised against the reported absence of theta oscillations in bats (Barry et al., 2012Barry C. Bush D. O’Keefe J. Burgess N.

Bush D. O’Keefe J. Burgess N. Models of grid cells and theta oscillations.Nature. 2012; 488 (E1-2; discussion E2-3)Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, Climer et al., 2015Climer J.R.

Examination of rhythmicity of extracellularly recorded neurons in the entorhinal cortex.Hippocampus. 2015; 25: 460-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, before examining temporal coding in the bat hippocampus, we started off by addressing these two concerns and found no continuous oscillations at any frequency in the 1–20 Hz range—including not in hippocampal interneurons, which exhibit very high firing rates. However, bat neurons did exhibit very strong locking to the non-rhythmic fluctuations of the field potential at the 1–20 Hz range. These fluctuations synchronized neurons together; moreover, some neurons also displayed phase precession and phase coding of the bat’s position relative to the “phase” of these non-rhythmic fluctuations. Our results suggest that normal hippocampal function entails synchronization of cell assemblies, as well as phase coding, which can be non-rhythmic as in bats or rhythmic as in rodents—but in both cases, the underlying neuronal coding principles might be surprisingly similar across species. We first focused on recording from hippocampal interneurons in Egyptian fruit bats, during both crawling and flight behaviors. Fast spiking interneurons are ideally suited for detecting oscillations—if these exist—because (1) interneurons exhibit very high firing rates (Figures 1A and 1B ) and thus provide robust statistical power for identifying oscillations, (2) they are active nearly continuously, which facilitates detection of low-frequency rhythms (Climer et al., 2015Climer J.R. DiTullio R. Newman E.L. Hasselmo M.E. Eden U.T. Examination of rhythmicity of extracellularly recorded neurons in the entorhinal cortex.Hippocampus. 2015; 25: 460-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and (3) in rodents, hippocampal interneurons are highly theta-modulated—hence they are often called “theta cells” (Buzsáki, 2006Buzsáki G. Rhythms of the Brain. Oxford University Press, 2006Crossref Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). We recorded 44 putative interneurons from hippocampal area CA1 during crawling (n = 6 cells) or flight (n = 38 cells); interneurons were separated from pyramidal cells based on spike width and firing rate. To assess firing rate rhythmicity in single neurons, we computed the spike train autocorrelation for spikes emitted during behavior (see the STAR Methods). The autocorrelation was computed over a long timescale of ±2 s, to enable detection of possible slow oscillations at sub-theta frequencies. For comparison, we also computed the autocorrelations of published data from hippocampal and entorhinal neurons of rats (Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T. Fyhn M. Molden S. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I.

Theta oscillations provide temporal windows for local circuit computation in the entorhinal-hippocampal loop.Neuron. 2009; 64: 267-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). These rat neurons exhibited very strong theta oscillations (Figures 1C and 1D, bottom: note repetitive vertical bands). By contrast, the 44 bat interneurons exhibited rather flat autocorrelations (Figures 1A, examples, and 1D, top—population: no vertical bands). This suggests a lack of oscillatory modulation in bat interneurons, during either flight or crawling. Likewise, no oscillations could be readily observed in spatially tuned neurons: namely, bat hippocampal place cells recorded during crawling (n = 42) or in-flight (n = 55), as well as medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) grid cells recorded during crawling (n = 25) (Figure 1D, top: no vertical bands). Thus, qualitative visual inspection did not reveal oscillations in the spike trains of either interneurons, place cells, or grid cells. Next, we systematically quantified possible rhythmicity in the spike trains of single cells by applying two different analysis methods (Royer et al., 2010Royer S. Sirota A. Patel J. Buzsáki G.

Development of the hippocampal cognitive map in preweanling rats.Science. 2010; 328: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) (see the STAR Methods). First, we fitted the autocorrelations with a decaying cosine function (Figures 2A–2F and S1A–S1C), which allows detecting both high and low frequencies (Figures S1B and S1C). In rat neurons, this method successfully fitted large oscillatory components (Figure 2A, red lines denote the fit). By contrast, bat neurons did not exhibit substantial oscillations (Figure 2D). To quantify the oscillation strength, we defined a “temporal fit oscillation index” (see the STAR Methods). Rat neurons exhibited much higher values of the oscillation index as compared to bat neurons (Figures 2B versus 2E; two-sided t test, comparing the rat data in 2B to each of the bat datasets in 2E: p < 10−20; p < 10−14; p < 10−3). While most rat neurons were significantly oscillatory (310/409, or 76%), very few bat neurons were significantly oscillatory (14/166, or 8.4%; see the STAR Methods). Moreover, the significant rat neurons were concentrated within a narrow frequency band around the theta frequency (Figure 2C, dots cluster around ∼8 Hz), while in the bat, those few cells that were significant were scattered across all possible frequencies (Figure 2F, dots do not cluster at any specific frequency). In a second analysis method, we computed the power spectrum of the autocorrelations (Figures S1D–S1I). Power spectra of rat neurons exhibited prominent peaks at the theta frequency (Figure 2G, see peak around ∼8 Hz), usually accompanied by some power at very low frequencies, representing the slow decay in the autocorrelations (Figure 2G). By contrast, power spectra of bat neurons did not show any clear peaks at a single frequency in the 1–20 Hz range (Figure 2J). Similar to the temporal fit analysis, we computed a “spectral oscillation index” and best frequency for each neuron (see the STAR Methods). Rat neurons exhibited much higher oscillation index than bat neurons (Figure 2H versus 2K; two-sided t test, comparing the rat data in Figure 2H to each of the bat datasets in Figure 2K: p < 10−5; p < 10−5; p < 10−6; p < 10−3). Similar to the previous analysis, almost all rat neurons (332/409 or 81%) passed the oscillation significance test, while only a few of the bat neurons were found to be significantly oscillatory (9/166, or 5.4%), and the frequencies of these few significant bat neurons were much more scattered (Figure 2L; compare to Figure 2I for rats). Further, 67% of the rat neurons (273/409 cells) were detected to be significantly oscillatory by both the temporal fit and spectral analyses; and moreover, rat neurons exhibited the same frequency in both analyses (Figure 2M: blue dots fall primarily along the identity diagonal). By contrast, 0% of bat neurons (0/166 cells) were found by both methods to exhibit significant oscillations (Figure 2N). This finding strongly suggests that there are no behavior-related continuous oscillations at the 1–20 Hz range in bat hippocampal or entorhinal neurons.Figure S1Temporal Fit and Spectral Analyses Methods, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A–C) Temporal fit analysis.(A) Fit equation: each component of the fit is marked by a different color, corresponding to the colors of the line-plots in B, which graphically depict these components.(B) Autocorrelation of a rat MEC neuron (gray bars), with an overlaid decaying-sinewave fit (red line).

Notably, some models relating rodent theta oscillations to memory may not require strictly sinusoidal oscillations, but could function just as well with non-rhythmic fluctuations of the local field potential (LFP), as long as these fluctuations synchronize the network (Lisman and Jensen, 2013Lisman J.E. Jensen O. The θ-γ neural code.Neuron. 2013; 77: 1002-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, Mehta, 2015Mehta M.R.

Larkin M.C. Frank L.M. A hippocampal network for spatial coding during immobility and sleep.Nature. 2016; 531: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that it is the synchrony of cell assemblies, rather than their rhythmic periodicity, that is crucial for the proposed memory functions of the theta oscillation (Mehta, 2015Mehta M.R. From synaptic plasticity to spatial maps and sequence learning.Hippocampus. 2015; 25: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To explore this idea, we next examined the nature of LFP fluctuations in CA1 and MEC of behaving bats and whether these fluctuations synchronize the network’s spiking activity. Recordings in bat CA1 and MEC during behavior revealed large non-rhythmic fluctuations in the LFP (Figure 3A, top and middle traces), which had an approximately 1/f spectrum (Figure 3A, right panels; see similar plots also in Ulanovsky and Moss, 2007Ulanovsky N.

Witter M.P. Ulanovsky N. Grid cells without theta oscillations in the entorhinal cortex of bats.Nature. 2011; 479: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed the LFP only from crawling data and not flight data, because in flight the LFP signal (but not the single unit spikes) is often contaminated by wing beat artifacts. The LFP fluctuations were synchronized across different tetrodes (Figures S4E and S4F). Because spikes of rodent CA1 pyramidal neurons tend to phase lock slightly after the theta oscillation trough (Buzsáki, 2002Buzsáki G. Theta oscillations in the hippocampus.Neuron. 2002; 33: 325-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar) (as schematized in Figure 3B, bottom)—we hypothesized that in bats, pyramidal neurons would discharge slightly after the trough of the non-rhythmic LFP fluctuations (as schematized in Figure 3B, top: see red ticks). To test this, we computed the phase of each spike relative to the LFP fluctuations (Figure 3C). LFP phase was measured by filtering the LFP between 1–10 Hz, detecting the troughs (as in Figure 3C, inverted gray triangles), and then computing the cycle-by-cycle phase of the non-rhythmic LFP (0–360° for each cycle) by linearly interpolating the times between consecutive LFP troughs. To reduce noise in the phase estimation, we included only those LFP cycles (and spikes occurring within these cycles) that exceeded the 25% percentile of LFP power: this excluded the LFP cycles where the power was too low to allow reliable detection of the LFP troughs (see the STAR Methods). We found that, indeed, many neurons in bat CA1 and MEC exhibited phase locking to a particular phase of the LFP fluctuations (see examples in Figures 3D and 3F, top panels, and S5C). Spikes locked at a later time within long cycles than within short cycles, suggesting a phase locking mechanism rather than time locking mechanism (Figures S2A and S2B). Across all bat CA1 neurons, 47% of the place cells (14/30 neurons) and 38% of the nonspatial principal cells (5/13) exhibited significant phase locking (see the STAR Methods; binomial tests: p < 10−10 and p < 0.001, respectively). Together, 44% of the CA1 principal cells (19/43) exhibited significant phase locking (binomial test, p < 10−13). As a population, CA1 neurons showed phase locking around a phase of ∼30°, slightly after the trough of the local LFP fluctuations (Figure 3E, top)—very similar to theta phase locking in rat CA1 place cells (Buzsáki, 2002Buzsáki G. Theta oscillations in the hippocampus.Neuron. 2002; 33: 325-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). Pooling spikes across cells yielded similar results (Figure 3E, bottom). In bat MEC, 20% of the grid cells (5/25 neurons) and 29% of the nonspatial principal cells (13/45) exhibited significant phase locking (binomial tests: p < 0.01 and p < 10−6, respectively). Across the MEC population, phase locking tended to be around a phase of ∼200° (Figure 3G). Phase locking of spikes was also evident in spike-triggered LFP analysis (Figures 3H, left, and S3A, top plots—see distinct peaks at around t = 0 s). Note the lack of oscillations around this peak—in striking contrast to the prominent theta oscillations in rat spike-triggered LFP (Figures 3H, right, and S3B). Spike-triggered LFP analysis revealed phase locking of spikes across frequencies—both when the LFP traces were filtered between 1–100 Hz prior to averaging (Figures 3H and S3A), as well as when the LFP was filtered between 1–10 Hz or between 10–20 Hz (Figure S3C). This indicates a rather broadband phase locking of spikes to LFP fluctuations, which was not limited to a particular frequency band"
https://openalex.org/W2896715898,"An understanding of how heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes, such as TBR1, contribute to ASD remains elusive. Conditional Tbr1 deletion during late mouse gestation in cortical layer 6 neurons (Tbr1layer6 mutants) provides novel insights into its function, including dendritic patterning, synaptogenesis, and cell-intrinsic physiology. These phenotypes occur in heterozygotes, providing insights into mechanisms that may underlie ASD pathophysiology. Restoring expression of Wnt7b largely rescues the synaptic deficit in Tbr1layer6 mutant neurons. Furthermore, Tbr1layer6 heterozygotes have increased anxiety-like behavior, a phenotype seen ASD. Integrating TBR1 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from layer 6 neurons and activity of TBR1-bound candidate enhancers provides evidence for how TBR1 regulates layer 6 properties. Moreover, several putative TBR1 targets are ASD risk genes, placing TBR1 in a central position both for ASD risk and for regulating transcriptional circuits that control multiple steps in layer 6 development essential for the assembly of neural circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2951255673,"Cortical interneurons display a remarkable diversity in their morphology, physiological properties, and connectivity. Elucidating the molecular determinants underlying this heterogeneity is essential for understanding interneuron development and function. We discovered that alternative splicing differentially regulates the integration of somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons into nascent cortical circuits through the cell-type-specific tailoring of mRNAs. Specifically, we identified a role for the activity-dependent splicing regulator Rbfox1 in the development of cortical interneuron-subtype-specific efferent connectivity. Our work demonstrates that Rbfox1 mediates largely non-overlapping alternative splicing programs within two distinct but related classes of interneurons."
https://openalex.org/W2896183637,"Generalized fear is a maladaptive behavior in which non-threatening stimuli elicit a fearful response. Here, we demonstrate that discrimination between predictive and non-predictive threat stimuli is highly sensitive to probabilistic discounting and increasing threat intensity in mice. We find that dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) encode both the negative valence of threat-predictive cues and the certainty of threat prediction. As fear generalization emerges, the dopamine neurons that are activated by a threat predictive cue (CS+) decrease the amplitude of activation and an equivalent signal emerges to a non-predictive cue (CS-). Temporally precise enhancement of dopamine neurons during threat conditioning to high threat levels or uncertain threats can prevent generalization. Moreover, phasic enhancement of genetically captured dopamine neurons activated by threat cues can reverse fear generalization. These findings demonstrate the dopamine neurons reflect the certainty of threat prediction that can be used to inform and update the fear engram."
https://openalex.org/W2897316664,"Metformin, the first-line drug to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D), inhibits mitochondrial glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase in the liver to suppress gluconeogenesis. However, the direct target and the underlying mechanisms by which metformin increases glucose uptake in peripheral tissues remain uncharacterized. Lipid phosphatase Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol-5-phosphatase 2 (SHIP2) is upregulated in diabetic rodent models and suppresses insulin signaling by reducing Akt activation, leading to insulin resistance and diminished glucose uptake. Here, we demonstrate that metformin directly binds to and reduces the catalytic activity of the recombinant SHIP2 phosphatase domain in vitro. Metformin inhibits SHIP2 in cultured cells and in skeletal muscle and kidney of db/db mice. In SHIP2-overexpressing myotubes, metformin ameliorates reduced glucose uptake by slowing down glucose transporter 4 endocytosis. SHIP2 overexpression reduces Akt activity and enhances podocyte apoptosis, and both are restored to normal levels by metformin. SHIP2 activity is elevated in glomeruli of patients with T2D receiving nonmetformin medication, but not in patients receiving metformin, compared with people without diabetes. Furthermore, podocyte loss in kidneys of metformin-treated T2D patients is reduced compared with patients receiving nonmetformin medication. Our data unravel a novel molecular mechanism by which metformin enhances glucose uptake and acts renoprotectively by reducing SHIP2 activity.-Polianskyte-Prause, Z., Tolvanen, T. A., Lindfors, S., Dumont, V., Van, M., Wang, H., Dash, S. N., Berg, M., Naams, J.-B., Hautala, L. C., Nisen, H., Mirtti, T., Groop, P.-H., Wähälä, K., Tienari, J., Lehtonen, S.

https://openalex.org/W2896616577,"The response of a cortical neuron to a motivationally salient visual stimulus can reflect a prediction of the associated outcome, a sensitivity to low-level stimulus features, or a mix of both. To distinguish between these alternatives, we monitored responses to visual stimuli in the same lateral visual association cortex neurons across weeks, both prior to and after reassignment of the outcome associated with each stimulus. We observed correlated ensembles of neurons with visual responses that either tracked the same predicted outcome, the same stimulus orientation, or that emerged only following new learning. Visual responses of outcome-tracking neurons encoded ""value,"" as they demonstrated a response bias to salient, food-predicting cues and sensitivity to reward history and hunger state. Strikingly, these attributes were not evident in neurons that tracked stimulus orientation. Our findings suggest a division of labor between intermingled ensembles in visual association cortex that encode predicted value or stimulus identity."

To study the genetic asymmetries on chromosomes, Cattanach, Searle, and colleagues analyzed offspring with uniparental disomies for specific regions that were generated by mating mice that were heterozygous for Robertsonian or balanced translocations (Cattanach and Kirk, 1985Cattanach B.M.

To date, approximately 100 imprinted genes have been described in mammals (Bartolomei and Ferguson-Smith, 2011Bartolomei M.S. Ferguson-Smith A.C. Mammalian genomic imprinting. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect.Biol. 2011; 3 (a002592)Google Scholar). The genetic asymmetries between parental genomes are also the subject of genetic conflict theory. This concept proposes that paternally inherited imprinted genes “extract” nutrients from the mother during gestation. By contrast, maternally inherited genes counteract the effect of paternal genes (Constância et al., 2004Constância M. Kelsey G. Reik W. Resourceful imprinting.Nature. 2004; 432: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, Wilkins and Haig, 2003Wilkins J.F. Haig D. What good is genomic imprinting: the function of parent-specific gene expression.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The differences between parental genomes, including genomic imprinting, underlie the uniparental reproduction barriers of mammals and promote the beneficial exchange of genetic information, the spread of evolutionarily advantageous mutations, and the maintenance of competitiveness in offspring (Wilkins and Haig, 2003Wilkins J.F.

However, many of the barriers to uniparental reproduction have not been revealed. For example, the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted region inherited from the father is essential for biparental embryo development (Constância et al., 2004Constância M. Kelsey G. Reik W. Resourceful imprinting.Nature. 2004; 432: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, Georgiades et al., 2000Georgiades P. Watkins M. Surani M.A. Ferguson-Smith A.C.

Obata Y. Wu Q. Niwa K. Ono Y. Yamamoto Y. Park E.S. Seo J.S. Ogawa H. Birth of parthenogenetic mice that can develop to adulthood.Nature. 2004; 428: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Global epigenetic investigation of immature oocytes is needed to understand these bimaternal reproduction barriers. However, the heterogeneous character of immature oocytes has limited such studies (Hiura et al., 2006Hiura H. Obata Y. Komiyama J. Shirai M. Kono T. Oocyte growth-dependent progression of maternal imprinting in mice.Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Accordingly, bipaternal reproduction, which has only been found in specific fish (Corley-Smith et al., 1996Corley-Smith G.E. Lim C.J. Brandhorst B.P.

Previously, we produced bimaternal mice by injecting parthenogenetic haploid ESCs (phESCs) with deletions of the H19 and Dlk-Dio2 intergenic region (IG) imprinted regions into MII oocytes and demonstrated the indispensability of the IG deletion (Li et al., 2016Li Z. Wan H. Feng G. Wang L. He Z. Wang Y. Wang X.J. Li W. Zhou Q. Hu B. Birth of fertile bimaternal offspring following intracytoplasmic injection of parthenogenetic haploid embryonic stem cells.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). By further characterization of haploid ESCs, we aim to determine why some deletions are sufficient to cross bimaternal reproduction barriers in mammals. We also investigated mechanisms preventing bipaternal reproduction and successfully mitigated the identified imprinting blocks to generate full-term bipaternal mice. First we performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) for a global methylation analysis of androgenetic haploid ESCs (ahESCs, ∼passage 20 and 40) and phESCs (∼passage 20 and 40) (Figure 1A). The haploid ESCs exhibited global hypomethylation compared with oocyte, sperm, and tail tip fibroblasts (TTFs) (Figure 1B). At the chromosomal level, the methylation patterns of haploid ESCs were similar to those of embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) primordial germ cells (PGCs), which had started global demethylation (Figure S1A; Kobayashi et al., 2013Kobayashi H. Sakurai T. Miura F. Imai M. Mochiduki K. Yanagisawa E. Sakashita A. Wakai T. Suzuki Y. Ito T. et al.High-resolution DNA methylome analysis of primordial germ cells identifies gender-specific reprogramming in mice.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Next we measured the average methylation levels at various genomic elements, including promoters, long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), long terminal repeats (LTRs), enhancers, and imprinted regions. The methylation levels of promoters, LINEs, SINEs, LTRs, and enhancers of haploid ESCs were similar to those of E10.5 PGCs (Figures 1C and S1B; Kobayashi et al., 2013Kobayashi H. Sakurai T. Miura F. Imai M. Mochiduki K. Yanagisawa E. Sakashita A. Wakai T. Suzuki Y. Ito T. et al.High-resolution DNA methylome analysis of primordial germ cells identifies gender-specific reprogramming in mice.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In particular, the imprinted regions that were demethylated in PGCs exhibited a low methylation level in haploid ESCs, similar to E13.5 PGCs (Figures 1C and 1D; Kobayashi et al., 2013Kobayashi H. Sakurai T. Miura F. Imai M. Mochiduki K. Yanagisawa E. Sakashita A. Wakai T. Suzuki Y. Ito T. et al.High-resolution DNA methylome analysis of primordial germ cells identifies gender-specific reprogramming in mice.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the intracisternal A-particle element (IAP), a demethylation-resistant component in PGCs (Lane et al., 2003Lane N. Dean W. Erhardt S. Hajkova P. Surani A. Walter J. Reik W. Resistance of IAPs to methylation reprogramming may provide a mechanism for epigenetic inheritance in the mouse.Genesis. 2003; 35: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), was maintained in haploid ESCs (Figure S1B). Additionally, PGC-specific promotors showed similar hypomethylation patterns between haploid ESCs and PGCs (Figure S1C; Guo et al., 2017Guo H. Hu B. Yan L. Yong J. Wu Y. Gao Y. Guo F. Hou Y. Fan X. Dong J. et al.DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility profiling of mouse and human fetal germ cells.Cell Res. 2017; 27: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Notably, the RRBS results also revealed that global hypomethylation and loss of imprint occurred earlier in phESCs (approximately passage 20) than in ahESCs (approximately passage 40) (Figures 1B and 1D). Bisulfite sequencing results also confirmed loss of imprints in early-passage phESCs (passage 20) but not in ahESCs (passage 24) (Figure 1E). Additional bisulfite sequencing analyses suggested different loss-of-imprint dynamics in phESCs and ahESCs (Figures S1D and S1E). To interrogate the differences, we performed principal-component analysis (PCA) with all related samples. The result showed that both the early- and late-passage phESCs as well as the late-passage ahESCs were clustered with hypomethylated PGCs, whereas the early-passage ahESCs were clustered with sperm and TTFs (Figure 1F). The loss of DNA methylation occurred more rapidly in phESCs than in ahESCs, suggesting unknown differences in sperm and oocyte inherited genomes under naive ESC culture. The hypomethylated ahESCs and phESCs presented a dome-shaped morphology, expressed typical pluripotency markers, and formed teratomas containing all three germ layers following subcutaneous injection into mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (Figures S2A–S2F). The hypomethylated haploid ESCs could generate germline-transmitted chimeric mice after injection into blastocysts, suggesting unimpaired pluripotency (Figures S2G and S2H). Collectively, we found that phESCs and ahESCs exhibited PGC-like demethylation processes with different dynamics. Previously, using homologous recombination, we introduced two deleted regions in phESCs and produced bimaternal mice (referred to as 2KO-bimaternal mice) by injection into MII oocytes (Figure 2A; Li et al., 2016Li Z. Wan H. Feng G. Wang L. He Z. Wang Y. Wang X.J. Li W. Zhou Q. Hu B. Birth of fertile bimaternal offspring following intracytoplasmic injection of parthenogenetic haploid embryonic stem cells.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The cells were used after prolonged in vitro cultivation (∼40 passages) and were expected to display the PGC-like hypomethylation status. We reported retardation of growth in juvenile 2KO-bimaternal mice (Li et al., 2016Li Z. Wan H. Feng G. Wang L. He Z. Wang Y. Wang X.J. Li W. Zhou Q. Hu B. Birth of fertile bimaternal offspring following intracytoplasmic injection of parthenogenetic haploid embryonic stem cells.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The adult 2KO-bimaternal mice exhibited a slower velocity and shorter moving distance in the open field test (Figures 2B and 2C). To understand these behavioral abnormalities, we compared the brain transcriptome of 2KO-bimaternal mice with the control and found 3 differentially imprinted genes: Th, Xlr3b, and Rasgrf1 (Figures 2D and S2I). The Th mutation caused hypoactivity (Zhou and Palmiter, 1995Zhou Q.Y. Palmiter R.D. Dopamine-deficient mice are severely hypoactive, adipsic, and aphagic.Cell. 1995; 83: 1197-1209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), whereas changes in Xlr3b expression affected cognition (Davies et al., 2005Davies W. Isles A. Smith R. Karunadasa D. Burrmann D. Humby T. Ojarikre O. Biggin C. Skuse D. Burgoyne P. Wilkinson L. Xlr3b is a new imprinted candidate for X-linked parent-of-origin effects on cognitive function in mice.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Rasgrf1 expression affected olfactory learning and memory (Drake et al., 2011Drake N.M. DeVito L.M. Cleland T.A. Soloway P.D. Imprinted Rasgrf1 expression in neonatal mice affects olfactory learning and memory.Genes Brain Behav. 2011; 10: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, all three genes had the potential to cause behavioral abnormalities when dysregulated. Impressively, the 2KO-bimaternal mice also exhibited longer lifespans than the control mice (Figure 2E). To understand the increased longevity, we tested metabolism-related factors in 2KO-bimaternal mice. A negative regulator of human lifespan, Igf1, was found to be decreased in bimaternal mice (Figure 2F; Suh et al., 2008Suh Y. Atzmon G. Cho M.O. Hwang D. Liu B. Leahy D.J. Barzilai N. Cohen P. Functionally significant insulin-like growth factor I receptor mutations in centenarians.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Additionally, the cholesterol level of these mice was found to be lower in serum biochemical tests (Figure 2G; Table S1). The above abnormalities in 2KO-bimaternal mice suggest the presence of postnatal developmental barriers in bimaternal reproduction. Among the 3 differential genes in 2KO-bimaternal mice, Rasgrf1 was consistent between neonates and adults (Figures 2D and S2I). We have also reported hypomethylation of the Rasgrf1 imprinted region in wild-type phESC-derived bimaternal embryos, which could develop up to E13.5 (Li et al., 2016Li Z. Wan H. Feng G. Wang L. He Z. Wang Y. Wang X.J. Li W. Zhou Q. Hu B. Birth of fertile bimaternal offspring following intracytoplasmic injection of parthenogenetic haploid embryonic stem cells.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the Rasgrf1 imprinted region was hypomethylated in 2KO-bimaternal mice, early-passage phESCs, and late-passage ahESCs (Figure 2H). Thus, we generated 3KO-phESCs by deleting the H19, IG, and Rasgrf1 imprinted regions by CRISPR-Cas9 in phESCs (approximately passage 24) (Figures 3A and S2J–S2N; Table S2) and successfully derived bimaternal pups by MII oocyte injection (Figures 3B and 3C). Notably, the 3KO-phESCs produced 29 (∼14%) live mice (referred to as 3KO-bimaternal mice) from 210 transferred embryos with an efficiency similar to that of round sperm (Table 1). The body (1.36 ± 0.78 g, n = 10) and placenta weights (0.11 ± 0.0056 g, n = 14) were normal (Figures S2O and S2P), and the Rasgrf1 expression level was recovered in these mice (Figure 3D). Unexpectedly, global transcriptome analysis showed that all detected imprinted genes were regularly expressed (Figure 3E). Consistent with this observation, the behaviors and growth curve of these mice were normalized (Figures 2B, 2C, 3F, and 3G). Additionally, all serum biochemical parameters and Igf1 expression were also normal in the 3KO-bimaternal mice (Figures 2F and 2G; Table S1).Table 1Development of Uniparental MiceMethodCell LineNo. of Passages∗No. of Transferred EmbryosNo. of Implantation Site (% ET)No. of Embryos Arrested 10.5−17.5 (% ET)No. of Full-Term Pups (% ET)Pup Phenotypes (% FT)No. of Surviving Pups (% ET)UELTLGDROocyte injectionround spermatid166––25 (15.1 ± 1.0)000024 (14.5 ± 1.3)phESC-1KO-1P22–P2827534 (12.4)2 (0.7)7 (2.6 ± 0.6)aphESCs versus round spermatid (p < 0.01).0004 (100)0aphESCs versus round spermatid (p < 0.01).phESC-1KO-2P21–P2721118 (12.9)1 (0.7)3 (1.1 ± 1.0)aphESCs versus round spermatid (p < 0.01).0003 (100)0aphESCs versus round spermatid (p < 0.01).phESC-2KO-1P21–P2617042 (23.3)015 (8.5 ± 2.3)bphESCs versus round spermatid (0.01 < p < 0.05).0001 (6.7)10 (5.0 ± 3.1)bphESCs versus round spermatid (0.01 < p < 0.05).phESC-2KO-2P20–P2611119 (17.1)1 (0.9)10 (8.9 ± 2.5)bphESCs versus round spermatid (0.01 < p < 0.05).0001 (10)7 (6.3 ± 1.6)aphESCs versus round spermatid (p < 0.01).phESC-3KO-1P27–P3311112 (16.9)016 (14.2 ± 2.3)cphESCs versus round spermatid (p > 0.05).000015 (13.4 ± 1.2)cphESCs versus round spermatid (p > 0.05).phESC-3KO-2P27–P359919 (26.4)013 (13.3 ± 2.5)cphESCs versus round spermatid (p > 0.05).000012 (12.3 ± 1.9)cphESCs versus round spermatid (p > 0.05).Tetraploid complementation∗∗C57 ESC1-1P16–P221126213 (11.6 ± 0.8)4 (4.4 ± 1.2)00003 (75)adESC-6KO-1P35–P3919812019 (9.5 ± 1.6)fahESCs versus C57ESC-1-1 (p > 0.05).3 (1.6 ± 0.4)eahESCs versus C57ESC-1-1 (0.01 < p < 0.05).2 (66.7)3 (100)2 (66)3 (100)0adESC-6KO-2P35–P4236120518 (5.3 ± 1.5)dahESCs versus C57ESC-1-1 (p < 0.01).5 (1.3 ± 0.4)eahESCs versus C57ESC-1-1 (0.01 < p < 0.05).3 (60)5 (100)2 (40)5 (100)0adESC-6KO-3P35–P4546430242 (8.1 ± 2.2)fahESCs versus C57ESC-1-1 (p > 0.05).4 (0.9 ± 0.3)dahESCs versus C57ESC-1-1 (p < 0.01).3 (75)4 (100)2 (50)4 (100)0adESC-7KO-1P43–P471419814 (10.0 ± 0.5)eahESCs versus C57ESC-1-1 (0.01 < p < 0.05).4 (2.8 ± 0.4)fahESCs versus C57ESC-1-1 (p > 0.05).1 (25)2 (50)1 (25)2 (50)0adESC-7KO-2P44–P48129929 (7.2 ± 1.3)dahESCs versus C57ESC-1-1 (p < 0.01).4 (3.0 ± 0.7)fahESCs versus C57ESC-1-1 (p > 0.05).1 (25)1 (25)1 (25)3 (75)0adESC-7KO-3P46–P4920712317 (8.5 ± 1.7)eahESCs versus C57ESC-1-1 (0.01 < p < 0.05).4 (1.9 ± 0.3)eahESCs versus C57ESC-1-1 (0.01 < p < 0.05).1 (25)1 (25)02 (50)2 (50)∗∗∗ET, transferred embryo; FT, full term; UE, unclosed eyelid; LT, long tongue; LG, leaky gut; DR, depressed respiration. ∗The passage of adESCs was calculated from the establishment of ahESCs. ∗∗The sex chromosome constitution of ESCs used for tetraploid complementation was XY. ∗∗∗Dead after 48 hr.a phESCs versus round spermatid (p < 0.01).b phESCs versus round spermatid (0.01 < p < 0.05).c phESCs versus round spermatid (p > 0.05).d ahESCs versus C57ESC-1-1 (p < 0.01).e ahESCs versus C57ESC-1-1 (0.01 < p < 0.05).f ahESCs versus C57ESC-1-1 (p > 0.05).

The RRBS analysis showed that the global methylation level of 3KO-bimaternal embryo and brain were similar to the wild-type (WT) (Figure 3H). Notably, the imprinted regions in bimaternal embryo and brain were comparable with the WT, except for the H19 imprinted region, which was demethylated for the absence of paternal inherited imprints (Figure 3I). To examine fertility, female 3KO-bimaternal mice were mated with WT males. A total of 22 pups were delivered in 6 litters. Nine pups carrying the IG or H19 deletion died after birth, and the other 13 mice grew into adults (Table S3). To calculate the actual litter size of 3KO-bimaternal mice, the numbers of viable pups (WT and Rasgrf1−/+) in each litter were multiplied by 4 according to the Mendelian ratio and compared with the litter sizes of WT females (n = 8). The corrected litter size of 3KO-bimaternal mice was calculated as 6.7 ± 0.84, comparable with the WT females (7.1 ± 0.40), indicating normal fertility (Figures 3J and 3K). These results demonstrated that all detected bimaternal reproduction barriers were crossed with the described system. To exclude that the phenotypic improvements of the bimaternal mice were caused by different passages between 3KO-phESCs (passage > 27) and 2KO-phESCs (IG and H19-KO, approximately passage 40) (Li et al., 2016Li Z. Wan H. Feng G. Wang L. He Z. Wang Y. Wang X.J. Li W. Zhou Q. Hu B. Birth of fertile bimaternal offspring following intracytoplasmic injection of parthenogenetic haploid embryonic stem cells.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we derived early-passage 2KO-phESCs (IG and H19-KO) and 1KO-phESCs (IG-KO) by CRISPR-Cas9 to reconstruct bimaternal embryos with MII oocytes. Consistent with our previous findings, the survival of bimaternal mice required deletion of both regions (Table 1). Specifically, early-passage 1KO-phESCs (passages 21∼28) and 2KO-phESCs (passages 20∼26) produced 10 (∼2.1%) and 25 (∼8.9%) full-term mice (referred as 1KO- and 2KO-bimaternal mice) from 486 and 281 transferred embryos, respectively (Table 1), comparable with our previous findings with late-passage 1KO- and 2KO-phESCs (Li et al., 2016Li Z. Wan H. Feng G. Wang L. He Z. Wang Y. Wang X.J. Li W. Zhou Q. Hu B. Birth of fertile bimaternal offspring following intracytoplasmic injection of parthenogenetic haploid embryonic stem cells.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All 1KO-bimaternal pups died after birth with severe retardation (Table 1; Figure S2Q). The body and placenta weights were recovered in 2KO-bimaternal pups, accompanied by restoration of Igf2 expression (Figures S2R–S2T). Additionally, the surviving 2KO-bimaternal mice exhibited ∼20% postnatal growth retardation compared with the WT (Figure 3G). These results showed that early-passage (passages 20∼26) and late-passage (approximately passage 40) phESCs were equal in producing bimaternal mice and proved that PGC-like imprint-free status was achieved in early-passage phESCs, consistent with the DNA methylation analyses (Figures 1D and 1E). The retardation of mouse embryos with two male pronuclei occurred much earlier than in female counterparts (Barton et al., 1984Barton S.C. Surani M.A.H. Norris M.L.

https://openalex.org/W2897027796,"Despite the known causality of copy-number variations (CNVs) to human neurodevelopmental disorders, the mechanisms behind each gene's contribution to the constellation of neural phenotypes remain elusive. Here, we investigated the 7q11.23 CNV, whose hemideletion causes Williams syndrome (WS), and uncovered that mitochondrial dysfunction participates in WS pathogenesis. Dysfunction is facilitated in part by the 7q11.23 protein DNAJC30, which interacts with mitochondrial ATP-synthase machinery. Removal of Dnajc30 in mice resulted in hypofunctional mitochondria, diminished morphological features of neocortical pyramidal neurons, and altered behaviors reminiscent of WS. The mitochondrial features are consistent with our observations of decreased integrity of oxidative phosphorylation supercomplexes and ATP-synthase dimers in WS. Thus, we identify DNAJC30 as an auxiliary component of ATP-synthase machinery and reveal mitochondrial maladies as underlying certain defects in brain development and function associated with WS."
https://openalex.org/W2897056819,"Mdn1 is an essential AAA (ATPase associated with various activities) protein that removes assembly factors from distinct precursors of the ribosomal 60S subunit. However, Mdn1’s large size (∼5,000 amino acid [aa]) and its limited homology to other well-studied proteins have restricted our understanding of its remodeling function. Here, we present structures for S. pombe Mdn1 in the presence of AMPPNP at up to ∼4 Å or ATP plus Rbin-1, a chemical inhibitor, at ∼8 Å resolution. These data reveal that Mdn1’s MIDAS domain is tethered to its ring-shaped AAA domain through an ∼20 nm long structured linker and a flexible ∼500 aa Asp/Glu-rich motif. We find that the MIDAS domain, which also binds other ribosome-assembly factors, docks onto the AAA ring in a nucleotide state-specific manner. Together, our findings reveal how conformational changes in the AAA ring can be directly transmitted to the MIDAS domain and thereby drive the targeted release of assembly factors from ribosomal 60S-subunit precursors."
https://openalex.org/W2897827291,"Neurons use two main schemes to encode information: rate coding (frequency of firing) and temporal coding (timing or pattern of firing). While the importance of rate coding is well established, it remains controversial whether temporal codes alone are sufficient for controlling behavior. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of specific temporal codes are enigmatic. Here, we show in Drosophila clock neurons that distinct temporal spike patterns, dissociated from changes in firing rate, encode time-dependent arousal and regulate sleep. From a large-scale genetic screen, we identify the molecular pathways mediating the circadian-dependent changes in ionic flux and spike morphology that rhythmically modulate spike timing. Remarkably, the daytime spiking pattern alone is sufficient to drive plasticity in downstream arousal neurons, leading to increased firing of these cells. These findings demonstrate a causal role for temporal coding in behavior and define a form of synaptic plasticity triggered solely by temporal spike patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2896697539,"Expansion of the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in exon 1 of the huntingtin protein (Httex1) leads to Huntington's disease resulting in fatal neurodegeneration. However, it remains poorly understood how polyQ expansions alter protein structure and cause toxicity. Using CD, EPR, and NMR spectroscopy, we found here that monomeric Httex1 consists of two co-existing structural states whose ratio is determined by polyQ tract length. We observed that short Q-lengths favor a largely random-coil state, whereas long Q-lengths increase the proportion of a predominantly α-helical state. We also note that by following a mobility gradient, Httex1 α-helical conformation is restricted to the N-terminal N17 region and to the N-terminal portion of the adjoining polyQ tract. Structuring in both regions was interdependent and likely stabilized by tertiary contacts. Although little helicity was present in N17 alone, each Gln residue in Httex1 enhanced helix stability by 0.03–0.05 kcal/mol, causing a pronounced preference for the α-helical state at pathological Q-lengths. The Q-length–dependent structuring and rigidification could be mimicked in proteins with shorter Q-lengths by a decrease in temperature, indicating that lower temperatures similarly stabilize N17 and polyQ intramolecular contacts. The more rigid α-helical state of Httex1 with an expanded polyQ tract is expected to alter interactions with cellular proteins and modulate the toxic Httex1 misfolding process. We propose that the polyQ-dependent shift in the structural equilibrium may enable future therapeutic strategies that specifically target Httex1 with toxic Q-lengths."
https://openalex.org/W2897507122,"During mitosis, chromatin condensation shapes chromosomes as separate, rigid, and compact sister chromatids to facilitate their segregation. Here, we show that, unlike wild-type yeast chromosomes, non-chromosomal DNA circles and chromosomes lacking a centromere fail to condense during mitosis. The centromere promotes chromosome condensation strictly in cis through recruiting the kinases Aurora B and Bub1, which trigger the autonomous condensation of the entire chromosome. Shugoshin and the deacetylase Hst2 facilitated spreading the condensation signal to the chromosome arms. Targeting Aurora B to DNA circles or centromere-ablated chromosomes or releasing Shugoshin from PP2A-dependent inhibition bypassed the centromere requirement for condensation and enhanced the mitotic stability of DNA circles. Our data indicate that yeast cells license the chromosome-autonomous condensation of their chromatin in a centromere-dependent manner, excluding from this process non-centromeric DNA and thereby inhibiting their propagation."
https://openalex.org/W2895913642,"In familial searching in forensic genetics, a query DNA profile is tested against a database to determine whether it represents a relative of a database entrant. We examine the potential for using linkage disequilibrium to identify pairs of profiles as belonging to relatives when the query and database rely on nonoverlapping genetic markers. Considering data on individuals genotyped with both microsatellites used in forensic applications and genome-wide SNPs, we find that ∼30%-32% of parent-offspring pairs and ∼35%-36% of sib pairs can be identified from the SNPs of one member of the pair and the microsatellites of the other. The method suggests the possibility of performing familial searches of microsatellite databases using query SNP profiles, or vice versa. It also reveals that privacy concerns arising from computations across multiple databases that share no genetic markers in common entail risks, not only for database entrants, but for their close relatives as well."

We found here that Tbpho91−/− trypanosomes have a lower growth rate under phosphate starvation and contain larger acidocalcisomes that have increased Pi content. Heterologous expression of TbPHO91 in Xenopus oocytes followed by two-electrode voltage clamp recordings disclosed that myo-inositol polyphosphates stimulate both sodium-dependent depolarization of the oocyte membrane potential and Pi conductance. Deletion of the SPX domain in TbPho91 abolished this stimulation. Inositol pyrophosphates such as 5-diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate generated outward currents in Na+/Pi-loaded giant vacuoles prepared from WT or from TbPHO91-expressing pho91Δ strains but not from the pho91Δ yeast strains or from the pho91Δ strains expressing PHO91 or TbPHO91 with mutated SPX domains.

Deletion of the SPX domain in TbPho91 abolished this stimulation. Inositol pyrophosphates such as 5-diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate generated outward currents in Na+/Pi-loaded giant vacuoles prepared from WT or from TbPHO91-expressing pho91Δ strains but not from the pho91Δ yeast strains or from the pho91Δ strains expressing PHO91 or TbPHO91 with mutated SPX domains. Our results indicate that TbPho91 and Pho91p are responsible for vacuolar Pi and Na+ efflux and that myo-inositol polyphosphates stimulate the Na+/Pi symporter activities through their SPX domains. Acidocalcisomes are acidic calcium stores rich in Pi, PPi, and polyphosphate (polyP) 3The abbreviations used are: polyPpolyphosphateVTCvacuolar transporter chaperone5-IP75-diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphatePCFprocyclic formPFAphosphonoformic acidNMDGN-methyl-d-glucamineIP6inositol hexakisphosphatePP-IP45-diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphateFBSfetal bovine serum. bound to cations such as calcium, magnesium, and sodium (1Rodrigues C.O.

Pi is negatively charged, and it needs to be transported into or out of cells or organelles via an active transport process. Pi transporters use either the transmembrane Na+ (animals, fungi) or H+ (plants, bacteria) gradients to drive Pi transport into cells (12Ravera S. Virkki L.V. Murer H. Forster I.C.

Pi transporters also occur in organelles, such as the mitochondrial proton/phosphate symporter (Pi carrier), an inner membrane-embedded protein that translocates Pi from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix (13Ferreira G.C. Pedersen P.L. Phosphate transport in mitochondria: past accomplishments, present problems, and future challenges.J. Bioenerg.

In a previous proteomic study of the acidocalcisomes of Trypanosoma brucei, we identified a Pi transporter with similarity to Pho91p, localized it to the acidocalcisome by expressing the HA-tagged protein, and suggested that this transporter, TbPho91, could also be involved in returning Pi to the cytosol after polyP hydrolysis (15Huang G.

As occurs with Pho91p (14Hürlimann H.C. Stadler-Waibel M. Werner T.P. Freimoser F.M.

A particularly strong binder is 5-diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (5-PP-IP5 or 5-IP7), an inositol pyrophosphate. 5-IP7 has five of the myo-inositol hydroxyl groups monophosphorylated, whereas the sixth, at the 5-position, contains a diphosphate group (19Albert C.

J. 1997; 327 (9359429): 553-56010.1042/bj3270553Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this work we investigated the function of TbPho91 by deleting its gene and examining the phenotypic changes in cells. We used the two-electrode voltage clamp method to directly measure membrane electric currents stimulated by inositol polyphosphates in Xenopus oocytes heterologously expressing TbPHO91, with or without its SPX domain. In addition, we patch-clamped giant vacuoles of yeast expressing either WT or SPX mutant Na+/Pi symporters. We provide evidence for the role of TbPho91 and Pho91p in Pi and Na+ release to the cytosol and for their SPX domain-mediated regulation by inositol pyrophosphates. A gene (Tb427tmp.01.2950), annotated as sodium/sulfate symporter or phosphate transporter and encoding for a putative PHO91 ortholog, is present in the T. brucei genome (http://tritrypdb.org/tritrypdb/) 4Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. and was named TbPHO91 (15Huang G.

The full-length gDNA of TbPHO91 was cloned by PCR amplification from the Lister 427 strain of T. brucei, confirmed by sequencing and shown to be identical to the gene in the database. The orthologs identified in T. cruzi (TcCLB.508831.60) and Leishmania major (LmjF.28.2930) share 65 and 59% amino acid identity, respectively, to TbPho91. The ORF predicts a 728-amino acid protein with an apparent molecular mass of 81.4 kDa, nine transmembrane domains (Fig. 1A), an N-terminal regulatory SPX domain, and an anion-permease domain also present in other anion transporters. In previous work, we reported the endogenous C-terminal tagging of TbPHO91 with an HA tag and the localization of TbPho91-HA predominantly to the acidocalcisomes of T. brucei (15Huang G. Ulrich P.N. Storey M. Johnson D. Tischer J. Tovar J.A. Moreno S.N. Orlando R. Docampo R.

Alignment of Pho91 from T. brucei (Protozoa, Euglenozoa) and S. cerevisiae (Fungi, Ascomycota) (Fig. 1B) shows the conservation of key residues for interaction with inositol polyphosphates in the SPX domain (17Wild R.

Moreover, the sodium/sulfate symporter domain is conserved in these organisms (67% similarity and 34% identical residues). We generated knockout mutants of TbPHO91 in procyclic forms (PCFs) by homologous recombination replacing both copies of the gene with resistance markers and isolated several clones. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that TbPHO91 was absent in one of these clones (Fig. 2A). These Tbpho91−/− cells did not show significant growth defect in regular medium but showed a significant growth defect in low phosphate medium (Fig. 2B). If TbPho91 is involved in the release of Pi and Na+ from acidocalcisomes, a possible consequence is the accumulation of Pi (and Na+) within the organelles with concomitant increase in their osmolarity. This was apparently the case as we detected higher levels of Pi in the mutants with no significant changes in polyP (Fig. 2C). Immunofluorescence analysis of Tbpho91−/− cells using antibodies against the vacuolar pyrophosphatase (TbVP1), an acidocalcisomal marker, showed enlarged organelles (Fig. 2D). The TbVP1 signals appear as small dots in WT cells and as larger ring-like structures in the Tbpho91 mutants. Mutant cells have increased numbers of larger acidocalcisomes (>0.2 μm) (Fig. 2E), and these results were confirmed by direct transmission EM of whole cells. In contrast to WT cells, Tbpho91−/− cells contained larger acidocalcisomes (Fig. 2F). The results are consistent with an increase in the acidocalcisomes osmolarity followed by water accumulation and enlargement. Previous work has shown lower levels of polyP and PPi when TcPHO91 was down-regulated (16Jimenez V. Docampo R. TcPho91 is a contractile vacuole phosphate sodium symporter that regulates phosphate and polyphosphate metabolism in Trypanosoma cruzi.Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 97 (26031800): 911-92510.1111/mmi.13075Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but no changes were observed in pho91Δ S. cerevisiae strains (14Hürlimann H.C. Stadler-Waibel M. Werner T.P. Freimoser F.M. Pho91 Is a vacuolar phosphate transporter that regulates phosphate and polyphosphate metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18 (17804816): 4438-444510.1091/mbc.e07-05-0457Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy of Tbpho91−/− cells grown under Pi starvation conditions showed further dilation of acidocalcisomes, which appeared to fuse in larger vacuoles (Fig. 2G). In conclusion our results showing that enlargement of acidocalcisomes increased Pi content and decreased growth rate under Pi starvation stress are consistent with a role for TbPho91 in Pi release from acidocalcisomes. We investigated the basic transport characteristics of TbPho91 by expressing it in Xenopus oocytes. Fig. 3A (upper tracing) shows the inward currents generated at holding potential (Vh = −60 mV) by addition of different concentrations of Na+/Pi to oocytes expressing TbPHO91. The current amplitude increased in a dose-dependent manner with a threshold around 2 mm, and the results are consistent with transport of a positive charge into the cell. Negligible current changes were observed in control diethylpyrocarbonate-injected oocytes (Fig. 3A, lower tracing), probably related to endogenous Pi-transporting mechanisms. Fig. 3B shows the curve obtained by fitting the peak currents recorded (as measured from the magnitude of the Pi-induced deflection) in the presence of increasing concentrations of Pi. According to the Hill equation, the calculated Km for Pi was 10.6 ± 1.1 mm (mean ± S.E. of five independent experiments) and shows that TbPho91 is a low-affinity transporter. The addition of 100 mm NaCl alone in the absence of Pi did not result in any significant change in current (Fig. 3C, left), whereas replacing Na+ by equimolar concentrations of K+ did not generate Pi-induced changes in currents (Fig. 3C, right), demonstrating the sodium selectivity of TbPho91. There was collapse of Vm in unclamped cells, indicating depolarization (Fig. 3D, lower panel). Phosphonoformic acid (PFA) is a highly specific competitive inhibitor (20Szczepanska-Konkel M. Yusufi A.N. Dousa T.P. Interactions of [14C]phosphonoformic acid with renal cortical brush-border membranes: relationship to the Na+-phosphate co-transporter.J. Biol.

Forster I.C. Deciphering PiT transport kinetics and substrate specificity using electrophysiology and flux measurements.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293 (17494632): C606-C62010.1152/ajpcell.00064.2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Treatment of TbPHO91-expressing oocytes with 10 mm PFA for 10 min did not impact the amplitude of the Na+/Pi current (288.3 ± 11.7 nA before PFA and 302 ± 39.3 nA after PFA, n = 4) (Fig. 4A), suggesting that TbPho91 could belong to the solute carrier family SLC20 of transporters (also called type III Na+/Pi co-transporters). The delayed decay of the Na+/Pi transient observed in Fig. 4A was caused by a PFA-induced slow inward current (Fig. 4B). To analyze the voltage dependence of the transporter, we registered the currents generated in oocytes expressing TbPHO91 in response to a step change in Vh from −80 to +40 mV (Fig. 5A). The current amplitude was measured at the steady-state part of the traces. Fig. 5A (left panel) shows representative raw currents in response to the voltage step protocol when perfused in the absence (−Pi) or presence (+Pi) of 10 mm Pi or after replacing NaCl by N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG). Quantification of averaged currents of oocytes expressing TbPHO91 (Fig. 5A, right panel) shows a significant increase in the steady-state current at positive (280% at +40 mV) and negative (294% at −80 mV) potential in the presence of 10 mm Pi (red triangles) when comparing to control conditions without Pi (black circles). Sodium dependence is demonstrated by the lack of response when NaCl is replaced by the nonpermeable cation NMDG (blue line). These results demonstrate that both Na+ and Pi are essential for TbPho91 activation. Pi induced a 430% higher steady-state current at +40 mV than at −40 mV (p < 0.05, Student’s t test, n = 5), indicating an outward-rectifying behavior with respect to Vh. Fig. 5B shows the anion selectivity by applying voltage pulses in the presence of either 10 mm sulfate (blue inverted triangles) or 10 mm nitrate (blue squares). No significant changes in the recorded currents were observed when compared with the controls in absence of anions. The Na+/Pi current showed strong dependence on the pH of the extracellular medium (Fig. 5C, left panel). Fig. 5C (right panel) shows a representative recording of currents, at different pH levels, in the presence of 10 mm Pi. The current amplitude in presence of 10 mm Pi was increased by 318%, from 98.9 ± 33.6 nA at pH 7.3 to 313.7 ± 93.7 nA at pH 7.8 (*, p < 0.05, n = 6). On the other hand, the shift of extracellular pH to more acidic values produced a decrease by 232% in the current amplitude to 42.7 ± 10.1 nA at pH 6.8 (*, p < 0.05, n = 6) or by 359% to 27.5 ± 4.8 nA (**, p < 0.05, n = 6) at pH 6.3 (Fig. 5C, right panel), which is more typical for type II than for type III Na+/Pi co-transporters (21Virkki L.V.B.J. Murer H. Forster I.C. Phosphate transporters:a tale of two solute carrier families.Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2007; 293 (17581921): F643-F65410.1152/ajprenal.00228.2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Complete removal of extracellular calcium from the bath solution (100 μm EGTA added) tended to amplify the Na+/Pi current, a change that, however, was not significant (p < 0.2, n = 5) (Fig. 6). Extracellular calcium concentrations above 1.8 mm were not tested, because this induced rapid death of oocytes. Taking into account its electrogenicity, low Pi affinity and resistance to PFA treatment, we suggest that TbPho91 belongs to the type III Na+/Pi co-transporters family (SLC20) (21Virkki L.V.B.J. Murer H. Forster I.C. Phosphate transporters:a tale of two solute carrier families.Am. J. Physiol. Renal.

It has been demonstrated that the SPX domains present in the N-terminal of phosphate transporters, VTCs, and signaling proteins act as inositol polyphosphate sensor domains by binding inositol polyphosphates and stimulating polyphosphate synthesis by VTCs in yeast (17Wild R. Gerasimaite R. Jung J.Y. Truffault V. Pavlovic I. Schmidt A. Saiardi A. Jessen H.J. Poirier Y. Hothorn M. Mayer A.

Although different SPX domains bind inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) and inositol pyrophosphates like 5-IP7 with similar affinities in vitro, it has been suggested that diphosphoinositol phosphates may be the relevant signaling molecules in vivo (17Wild R. Gerasimaite R. Jung J.Y. Truffault V. Pavlovic I. Schmidt A. Saiardi A. Jessen H.J. Poirier Y. Hothorn M. Mayer A.

We therefore investigated whether this was also the case with TbPho91. Preincubation of oocytes for 5–6 min with InsP6, in the μm range (Fig. 7, A and B) or with 5-IP7 (Fig. 8A) or 5-diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate (PP-IP4) (Fig. 8B) in the nanomolar range induced slow inward currents with subsequent amplification of the Na+/Pi–transmembrane current evoked by 10 mm Pi. The threshold for statistically significant amplification of the Na+/Pi current was 100 μm for IP6 (+82.5 ± 39.5%; *, p < 0.05, n = 4) (Fig. 7C). For 5-IP7, the amplification threshold was 50 nm (+9.2 ± 3.5%; *, p < 0.05, n = 5), and for PP-IP4, it was 1 μm (+61.7 ± 26.6%; *, p < 0.05, n = 4) (Fig. 8C). Further increases of the phosphate-containing ligands enhanced the amplification of the Na+/Pi currents (Figs. 7C and 8C).Figure 8Effect of 5-IP7 and PP-IP4 on Pi-elicited currents in oocytes expressing TbPho91 and ΔSPX-TbPho91.

Neither 5-IP7 nor PP-IP4 (Fig. 8, A and B) could amplify the currents induced by 10 mm Pi addition in TbPHO91-ΔSPX-expressing oocytes. Acidocalcisomes have a diameter of ∼200 nm, and it is very difficult to do patch-clamp studies with these small organelles to test Na+/Pi currents. Because the yeast vacuole has many similarities to the trypanosome acidocalcisome, we used giant vacuoles (up to ∼20 μm in diameter) from yeast instead. This method has the additional advantage over the Xenopus studies that it is possible to eliminate endogenous currents by inactivation of the genes in yeasts. We prepared giant cells of S. cerevisiae by the spheroplast incubation method using 2-deoxy-glucose to inhibit cell wall synthesis (24Yabe I. Horiuchi K. Nakahara K. Hiyama T. Yamanaka T. Wang P.C. Toda K. Hirata A. Ohsumi Y. Hirata R. Anraku Y. Kusaka I.

When using this method and when the giant cells are treated by moderate hyposmotic shock, only the plasma membranes are disrupted, and giant vacuoles are released. It is then possible to attach a patch pipette to isolated vacuoles and rupture the patch membrane using a high voltage pulse (Fig. 9A). The vacuolar lumen, which is connected to the pipette (whole-vacuole configuration), can then be loaded with a solution containing Na+ and Pi to monitor the currents across the membrane. We generated a knockout of PHO91 using homologous recombination to replace the genomic sequence of PHO91 by a resistance marker and used these cells to express mutant or WT PHO91 and TbPHO91. A previous high-throughput screening assay reported pho91Δ mutants as having a small defect in vacuolar fragmentation (25Michaillat L. Mayer A. Identification of genes affecting vacuole membrane fragmentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.PLoS One. 2013; 8 (23383298)e5416010.1371/journal.pone.0054160Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, we did not find morphological alterations in the vacuoles of pho91Δ (data not shown). Once vacuoles were released by hyposmotic shock of giant cells, they were patched and clamped at a voltage of +60 mV. The bath solution had 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, containing 100 mm NaCl, 200 mm sorbitol, and 1 mm MgCl2, whereas the pipette solution contained the same mixture plus 10 mm NaHPO4-Na2HPO4 to detect outward currents generated by displacement of Na+/Pi from the vacuoles to the bath solution (“cytosol”). Application of 1 mm IP6 or 1 μm 5-IP7 to the bath solution (Fig. 9B) induced outward currents of 169.3 ± 28.1 and 102 ± 22.5 pA (n = 4), whereas no significant currents were detected when 1-IP7 (the other IP7 present in yeast (18Gerasimaite R.

https://openalex.org/W2895780046,"Modelling cultural ecosystem services is an enduring challenge, raising issues about the integration and spatialization of immaterial values and benefits, and their contingency on local preferences. Building on the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum framework, we present a novel methodology for assessing the recreation service using GPS tracks downloaded from crowd-sourced websites: the Grelou model (Georeferencing REcreation in Local OUtdoors), here applied to the Grenoble living area (French Alps). GPS tracks revealed the complete spatial extent of visitor presence and enabled modelling visitation networks for ten recreation activities with great spatial accuracy, thus providing a spatial estimate of recreational multifunctionality-expressed as the sum of networks. After coupling track networks with landscape preference and proximity factors, Grelou assessed the recreation service as a combination of opportunity and preferences, and identified recreation hotspots of different profiles such as aroundoor leisure or outdoor sport. We performed an online survey among local sports associations using an interactive map to select districts visited by respondents (~1000 people). The declared visitor presence for recreation purposes was highly spatially congruent with Grelou outputs (R2 = 0.89). Detailed analysis of responses on selection criteria for recreationists validates our choice of critical factors underlying both the recreation opportunity potential and the expected visitation frequency over the whole study area. We also analyzed outputs of the InVESt recreation model against the same visitation explanatory factors. Differences between the two models allowed us to pinpoint biases and weaknesses in the InVESt recreation modelling framework based on crowd-sourced photographs. By making use of an increasingly available data source (GPS tracks), Grelou offers a standardized and flexible way to assess the recreation service associated with multiple recreation practices. Its high spatial accuracy supports the analysis of spatial relationships with other ecoystems services and the integration of recreation into environmental assessments, land management and planning."
https://openalex.org/W2765407761,"In vision science, cascades of Linear+Nonlinear transforms are very successful in modeling a number of perceptual experiences [Carandini&Heeger12]. However, the conventional literature is usually too focused on only describing the input->output transform. Instead, here we present the maths of such cascades beyond the forward transform, namely the Jacobians and the inverse. The fundamental reason for this analytical treatment is that it offers useful insight into the psychophysics, the physiology, and the function of the visual system. For instance, we show how the trends of the sensitivity (discrimination regions) and the adaptation of the receptive fields can be seen in the expression of the Jacobian wrt the stimulus. This matrix also tells us which regions of the stimulus space are encoded more efficiently in multi-information terms. The Jacobian wrt the parameters shows which aspects of the model have bigger impact in the response, and hence bigger relevance. The analytic inverse implies conditions for the response and the model to ensure decoding. From an applied perspective, (a) the Jacobian wrt the stimulus is necessary in new experimental methods based on the synthesis of visual stimuli with interesting geometry, (b) the Jacobian matrices wrt the parameters are convenient to learn the model from classical experiments or alternative optimization goals, and (c) the inverse is a model-based alternative to blind machine-learning neural decoding that does not include meaningful biological information. The theory is checked by building a derivable and invertible vision model that actually follows the modular program suggested by Carandini&Heeger. To stress the generality of this modular setting we show examples where some of the canonical Divisive Normalization layers are substituted by equivalent layers such as the Wilson-Cowan model at V1, or a tone-mapping model at the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2897580718,"Neuronal computations critically depend on the connectivity rules that govern the convergence of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic signals onto individual neurons. To examine the functional synaptic organization of a distributed memory network, we performed voltage clamp recordings in telencephalic area Dp of adult zebrafish, the homolog of olfactory cortex. In neurons of posterior Dp, odor stimulation evoked large, recurrent excitatory and inhibitory inputs that established a transient state of high conductance and synaptic balance. Excitation and inhibition in individual neurons were co-tuned to different odors and correlated on slow and fast timescales. This precise synaptic balance implies specific connectivity among Dp neurons, despite the absence of an obvious topography. Precise synaptic balance stabilizes activity patterns in different directions of coding space and in time while preserving high bandwidth. The coordinated connectivity of excitatory and inhibitory subnetworks in Dp therefore supports fast recurrent memory operations."
https://openalex.org/W2896056742,"A halotolerant bacterial consortium capable of degrading di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was enriched from activated sludge. Community analysis revealed that LF contained seven families and seven genera of bacteria. The predominant species was Gordonia sp. (54.93%), Rhodococcus. sp. (9.92%) and Achromobacter sp. (8.47%). The consortium could degrade 93.84% of 1000 mg/l DEHP after 48 h incubation. The optimal temperature and pH for LF to degrade DEHP were 30 °C and 6.0, respectively. LF degraded more than 91% of DEHP with salt concentrations ranging from 0-3%. The inoculum size had great effects on DEHP degradation (incubation time < 24h). LF could degrade high concentrations of DEHP (from 100 to 2000 mg/l) with the degradation ratio above 92% after 72 h incubation. Kinetics analysis revealed that the degradation of DEHP by LF was best fitted by the first-order kinetics when the initial concentration ranged from 100 to 2000 mg/l. The main intermediates (2-ethylhexyl pentyl phthalate, butyl (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (BEHP), mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-hexyl phthalate (MHP), mono-butyl phthalate (MBP)) in DEHP degradation process were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and a new complex biochemical pathway was proposed. Furthermore, LF could also degrade dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP) and phthalic acid (PA)."
https://openalex.org/W2896660385,"Restoration efforts with native eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, in Chesapeake Bay and elsewhere have been limited by shell availability, necessitating the use of alternative structures as subtidal reefs, yet these have rarely been evaluated quantitatively. We quantified population structure, density, abundance and biomass of eastern oyster and hooked mussel, Ischadium recurvum, on a concrete modular reef (75 m2 surface area over 5 m2 of river bottom) deployed subtidally at 7 m depth in the Rappahannock River, Virginia during October, 2000. After nearly 5 y (May 2005), we took 120 stratified random samples over the reef. The reef was heavily colonized by 28-168 oysters and 14-2177 mussels m-2 surface area. These densities translate to 1085 oysters and 8617 mussels m-2 river bottom, which are the highest recorded for artificial oyster reefs. Size structure of oysters reflected four year classes, with over half of oysters more than 1 y old and of reproductive age. Oyster biomass (1663 g dry mass m-2 river bottom) and condition index were equally high, whereas parasite prevalence and intensity were low. Oyster density correlated positively in a sigmoid fashion with mussel density up to high densities, then declined. This modular reef is one of the most successful artificial reefs for eastern oyster and hooked mussel restoration, and details features that are conducive for successful settlement, growth and survival in subtidal habitats."

The crystal structure of the DHOase domain of human CAD (huDHOase) revealed that, despite evolutionary divergence, its active site components are highly conserved with those in bacterial DHOases, encoded as monofunctional enzymes. An important element for catalysis, conserved from Escherichia coli to humans, is a flexible loop that closes as a lid over the active site. Here, we combined mutagenic, structural, biochemical, and molecular dynamics analyses to characterize the function of the flexible loop in the activity of CAD's DHOase domain. A huDHOase chimera bearing the E. coli DHOase flexible loop was inactive, suggesting the presence of distinctive elements in the flexible loop of huDHOase that cannot be replaced by the bacterial sequence. We pinpointed Phe-1563, a residue absolutely conserved at the tip of the flexible loop in CAD's DHOase domain, as a critical element for the conformational equilibrium between the two catalytic states of the protein. Substitutions of Phe-1563 with Ala, Leu, or Thr prevented the closure of the flexible loop and inactivated the protein, whereas substitution with Tyr enhanced the interactions of the loop in the closed position and reduced fluctuations and the reaction rate.

In all cases, the first residue is a threonine, namely Thr-109 in E. coli DHOase (ecDHOase) or Thr-1562 in huDHOase, which interacts through its side chain with the β-COOH group of CA-asp (Fig. 1, B–E).

Structure, functional characterization, and evolution of the dihydroorotase domain of human CAD.Structure. 2014; 22 (24332717): 185-19810.1016/j.str.2013.10.016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that mutations T1562A or F1563A impair the activity of huDHOase (2Grande-García A. Lallous N. Diaz-Tejada C. Ramón-Maiques S. Structure, functional characterization, and evolution of the dihydroorotase domain of human CAD.Structure. 2014; 22 (24332717): 185-19810.1016/j.str.2013.10.016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) proving that, as in ecDHOase, the flexible loop also plays a key functional role in CAD. Now, we further interrogated how the flexible loop contributes to the activity of huDHOase. We report that a human DHOase chimera bearing the flexible loop of E. coli DHOase is inactive, suggesting that, despite having a conserved function, the flexible loops might have different functional and structural features. We also produced four different huDHOase variants, replacing Phe-1563 at the tip of the flexible loop with Ala, Thr, Leu, or Tyr, measured the activities, and determined their crystal structures. These results, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, highlight the key contribution of the phenylalanine in configuring the active site of CAD's DHOase domain. To test the functional similarity between the flexible loops of human and E. coli DHOases, we replaced the loop of huDHOase (1559LNETFSELRLD1569) with the equivalent region in ecDHOase (105PANATTNSSHGVT117) (Fig. 1C). We generated two huDHOase chimeras, one with the exact E. coli flexible loop (hereafter referred to as mutant EFL-1) and another one that preserves residue Leu-1559 at the beginning of the loop (mutant EFL-2) in case a proline could affect the movements of the hinge residues after strand β4 (Figs. 1C and 2, A and B). Both mutants were produced following a protocol similar to that for huDHOase wildtype (WT) (Fig. S1), although the lower yield suggested folding or solubility problems. Indeed, salt concentration in final size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) was increased (from 0.15 to 0.25 m) to prevent protein precipitation. Analysis by SEC coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) showed that the EFL mutants injected at 1.2 μm eluted in a main peak corresponding to a monomer, whereas the WT behaved as a dimer at this concentration (Fig. 2, A and B). At 6–12 μm, the mutants eluted in a broader peak of ∼60 kDa, suggesting an equilibrium between monomer and dimer. By increasing the concentration to 100 μm, the EFL mutants eluted in a main peak of ∼80 kDa, matching the values obtained for the WT dimer (12Lallous N. Grande-Garcia A. Molina R. Ramon-Maiques S. Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of the dihydroorotase domain of human CAD.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst.

Using sedimentation velocity analysis, we estimated that the Kd for the EFL-2 dimer was 1.1 ± 0.4 μm, (Fig. 2C), whereas we had failed to detect the dissociation of the WT dimers under similar conditions (2Grande-García A. Lallous N. Diaz-Tejada C. Ramón-Maiques S.

These results indicate that the replacement of the flexible loop weakens the dimerization of huDHOase. We determined the crystal structure of the mutant EFL-2 free of ligands and in complex with DHO or with the inhibitor fluoroorotic acid (FOA). Crystals grown under similar conditions as WT reached ∼0.1 mm in the maximum dimension and belonged to space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions a = 82, b = 159, and c = 61 Å (Table 1). The crystals diffracted X-rays to resolutions better than 1.8 Å using synchrotron radiation, and the phases were determined by molecular replacement. As reported for the WT (2Grande-García A. Lallous N. Diaz-Tejada C. Ramón-Maiques S.

The electron density is continuous and well-defined for the entire polypeptide chain except for the mutated loop, which can hardly be seen in the structures with DHO or FOA but which clearly adopts an open conformation in the apostructure (Fig. 2, D and E). The rest of the EFL structure is virtually identical to the WT, including the Zn2+ ions and the bridging water at the active site. The DHO and FOA molecules occupy the position described for the WT, although they make an additional interaction with the side chain of Tyr-1558 that adopts a different rotamer (Fig. 2D). Because we could not crystallize the mutant bound to CA-asp, it is unclear whether the E. coli flexible loop could reach a closed conformation on the huDHOase active site to favor the reaction (Fig. 2E).Table 1Data collection and refinement statistics for apostructuresMutantsEFL-2F1563AF1563TF1563LF1563YPDB code6HG16HFI6HFE6HFD6HFFData collectionBeamlineID23-1, ESRFXALOC, ALBAXALOC, ALBAXALOC, ALBAXALOC, ALBAWavelength (Å)1.00.97950.97950.97950.9795Space groupC2221C2221C2221C2221C2221Unit cell: a, b, c (Å)81.1, 160.6, 59.081.8, 159.1, 61.381.7, 158.7, 61.081.6, 158.8, 60.981.7, 159.2, 61.1Resolution (Å)72.36–2.1279.50–1.4672.64–1.4872.55–1.8572.71–1.51(2.19–2.12)(1.50–1.46)(1.52–1.48)(1.90–1.85)(1.55–1.51)No. reflections144,446/22,259449,732/69,387436,553/66,300221,637/34,137411,993/62,751(observed/unique)(13,296/2,197)(31,606/5,050)(32,512/4,859)(16,576/2,507)(30,743/4,608)Multiplicity6.5 (6.0)6.5 (6.3)6.6 (6.7)6.5 (6.6)6.6 (6.7)Rmeas (%)8.5 (98.5)6.2 (71.4)5.9 (67.7)8.9 (68.6)5.5 (68.3)I/σI13.3 (2.5)18.1 (3.1)17.9 (3.0)17.8 (3.8)19.2 (3.7)Completeness (%)99.5 (99.2)99.6 (99.5)100.0 (99.9)99.9 (99.9)100.0 (99.9)CC½99.8 (80.6)99.9 (90.1)91.9 (88.5)99.9 (91.3)99.9 (91.8)Wilson B-factor (Å2)41.6923.325.431.227.6RefinementResolution (Å)45.72–2.1228.25–1.4630.48–1.4839.69–1.8733.34–1.51No. reflections22,24969,42566,28333,06562,741R-factor/Rfree (%)18.03/20.7612.73/16.3812.09/15.6812.15/15.9412.61/15.11r.m.s. deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0060.0090.0080.010.011Bond angles (°)1.201.3921.3271.3401.16No. atoms (no H)Protein + ligand2,9202,9082,9052,8972,911Water63391359275308Ramachandran plotFavored (%)96.4595.2496.5196.5395.52Allowed (%)3.014.232.952.403.92Outliers (%)0.550.530.541.070.56 Open table in a new tab We characterized the activity of mutant EFL-1.

The activity of the mutant is strongly diminished, with turnover rates in the forward (kcatCA-asp = 1.7 ± 1.1 min−1) and reverse (kcatDHO = 5.9 ± 0.9 min−1) reactions that are 120- or 50-fold lower, respectively, compared with the WT (Fig. 3, A and B). These results further support the understanding that the flexible loop of huDHOase is key for the reaction and suggest that the E. coli flexible loop might not be compatible with the human enzyme. We then focused on a distinctive feature of the DHOase domain of CAD, the Phe at the tip of the flexible loop. We made three huDHOase mutants substituting Phe-1563 with Thr (mutant F1563T), Leu (F1563L), or Tyr (F1563Y). These variants and the previously reported F1563A mutant were produced as the WT (Fig. S1) and behaved as stable dimers in solution (data not shown). Mutants F1563A, F1563T, and F1563L show a decreased rate in the forward reaction of 4–8% of the WT, whereas the activity in the reverse reaction is ∼1% (Fig. 3, A and B). In turn, mutation F1563Y causes a milder effect, with activities that are 44 and 72% in the forward and reverse reactions, respectively, compared with the WT. The four mutants show a KmCA-asp similar to the WT, and although the low activity did not allow us to measure the KmDHO of mutants F1563A/F1563T/F1563L, the KmDHO of mutant F1563Y was also similar to the WT (Fig. 3, C and D). These results indicate that the reduced catalytic efficiency is not an effect of substrate concentration (Km) but rather a decrease in kcat because of the substitution of the conserved Phe residue in the flexible loop. It is noteworthy that the different Phe-1563 mutations do not affect the forward and reverse reactions equally. As reported for the WT (2Grande-García A. Lallous N. Diaz-Tejada C. Ramón-Maiques S. Structure, functional characterization, and evolution of the dihydroorotase domain of human CAD.Structure. 2014; 22 (24332717): 185-19810.1016/j.str.2013.10.016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), mutant F1563Y is more efficient in catalyzing the forward than the reverse reaction at their optimum pH values, although both rates equilibrate near neutral pH (Fig. 3A). By contrast, mutants F1563A, F1563T, and F1563L show a more detrimental effect in the reverse than in the forward reaction, although as before, the effect on both rates is comparable at pH 7. To understand the impact of the mutations on the function of the flexible loop, we determined the structures of the Phe-1563 mutants crystallized in the absence or presence of CA-asp at different pH values. Well-diffracting crystals of the four mutants grew under similar conditions and presented the same space group and unit cell as the WT and EFL-2 mutant (Table 1, Table 2 and Table S1).

https://openalex.org/W2897335102,"The exact route of iron through the kidney and its regulation during iron overload are not completely elucidated. Under physiologic conditions, non-transferrin and transferrin bound iron passes the glomerular filter and is reabsorbed through kidney epithelial cells, so that hardly any iron is found in the urine. To study the route of iron reabsorption through the kidney, we analyzed the location and regulation of iron metabolism related proteins in kidneys of mice with iron overload, elicited by iron dextran injections. Transferrin Receptor 1 was decreased as expected, following iron overload. In contrast, the multi-ligand hetero-dimeric receptor-complex megalin/cubilin, which also mediates the internalization of transferrin, was highly up-regulated. Moreover, with increasing iron, intracellular ferritin distribution shifted in renal epithelium from an apical location to a punctate distribution throughout the epithelial cells. In addition, in contrast to many other tissues, the iron exporter ferroportin was not reduced by iron overload in the kidney. Iron accumulated mainly in interstitial macrophages, and more prominently in the medulla than in the cortex. This suggests that despite the reduction of Transferrin Receptor 1, alternative pathways may effectively mediate re-absorption of iron that cycles through the kidney during parenterally induced iron-overload. The most iron consuming process of the body, erythropoiesis, is regulated by the renal erythropoietin producing cells in kidney interstitium. We propose, that the efficient re-absorption of iron by the kidney, also during iron overload enables these cells to sense systemic iron and regulate its usage based on the systemic iron state."

Patients with tuberculosis especially multi drug resistant (MDR-TB) suffer from social isolation, stigma, lack of support and economic constraints. In Ethiopia, the trend of MDR TB is increasing and becoming a serious public health problem. However, little is known about patients except treatment outcomes, financial burden and psychological distress with serious deficiency of data on Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL). Hence, the aim of this study was to assess HRQOL of MDR TB patients in comparison with drug sensitive pulmonary TB (DSTB) patients.We included 100 cases of MDR and 300 controls with DSTB who were matched by sex. Data were collected using SF- 36v2 TM questionnaire and analysed with SPSS version 20. Independent t-test and conditional logistic regression analysis was done considering P-values of less than 0.05 statistically significant. Eight in-depth interviews were also conducted with both groups and represented with verbatim quotations and narrative texts.There were no statistically significant differences in mean scores for health related quality of life between cases and controls (57.61±16.42 and 59.13±22.10) nor were there significant differences in physical functioning, role disruption due to physical problems, vitality, social functioning, role disruption due to emotional distress, or overall mental health. Individuals with MDR-TB were significantly more likely to be single, a current student, and with lower education and families with more than 5 people than individuals with Drug sensitive TB, all of which were significantly associated with poorer HRQOL (p<0.05). There was good internal consistency of the scale scores, with a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.73.Individuals with MDR-TB reported statistically worse general health but less bodily pain than individuals with Drug sensitive TB. To regain the role function they lost, we recommend that health facilities, media and all other stakeholders educate the community, households and students about pulmonary tuberculosis, treatment, prevention methods and therapeutic approaches towards TB patients, specifically MDR-TB."

https://openalex.org/W2897247503,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been reported in a variety of cancers. SRY-box 2 (SOX2) is a member of the SOX family of transcription factors and has been shown to play a critical role in maintaining the functions of CSCs and promoting tumor initiation. However, the underlying mechanisms for the transcriptional regulation of the SOX2 gene in CSCs are unclear. In this study, using in silico and experimental approaches, we identified transcriptional repressor GATA binding 1 (TRPS1), an atypical GATA-type transcription factor, as a critical transcriptional regulator that represses SOX2 expression and thereby suppresses cancer stemness and tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, TRPS1 repressed SOX2 expression by directly targeting the consensus GATA-binding element in the SOX2 promoter as elucidated by ChIP and luciferase reporter assays. Of note, in vitro mammosphere formation assays in culture and in vivo xenograft tumor initiation experiments in mouse models revealed that TRPS1-mediated repression of SOX2 expression suppresses CSC functions and tumor initiation.

In this study, using in silico and experimental approaches, we identified transcriptional repressor GATA binding 1 (TRPS1), an atypical GATA-type transcription factor, as a critical transcriptional regulator that represses SOX2 expression and thereby suppresses cancer stemness and tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, TRPS1 repressed SOX2 expression by directly targeting the consensus GATA-binding element in the SOX2 promoter as elucidated by ChIP and luciferase reporter assays. Of note, in vitro mammosphere formation assays in culture and in vivo xenograft tumor initiation experiments in mouse models revealed that TRPS1-mediated repression of SOX2 expression suppresses CSC functions and tumor initiation. Taken together, our study provides detailed mechanistic insights into CSC functions and tumor initiation by the TRPS1–SOX2 axis.

Transcriptional repressor GATA binding 1 (TRPS1), an atypical member of GATA transcriptional factor family, contains an atypical GATA-type zinc finger motif. TRPS1 is implicated in stem cell functions because its overexpression promotes differentiation of chondrogenic cells (12Itoh S. Kanno S. Gai Z. Suemoto H. Kawakatsu M. Tanishima H. Morimoto Y.

TRPS1 expression is also elevated in luminal breast cancer as compared with basal breast cancer (14Wu L. Wang Y. Liu Y. Yu S. Xie H. Shi X. Qin S. Ma F. Tan T.Z. Thiery J.P. Chen L.

However, whether and how TRPS1 contributes to CSC functions and tumor initiation by regulating SOX2 expression is mostly unknown. In the current study, we report that TRPS1 represses SOX2 expression by directly targeting its promoter and thus suppressing CSC functions and tumor initiation. SOX2 plays an important role in CSC functions (18Liu K. Lin B. Zhao M. Yang X. Chen M. Gao A. Liu F. Que J. Lan X. The multiple roles for Sox2 in stem cell maintenance and tumorigenesis.Cell. Signal. 2013; 25 (23416461): 1264-127110.1016/j.cellsig.2013.02.013Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To address how SOX2 expression is regulated, we set out to identify new candidate transcription factors targeting SOX2. By analyzing the promoter sequence of SOX2 in silico, we determined that SOX2 promoter contains the WGATAR sequence element, which is a well characterized consensus sequence recognized by GATA transcription factors (Fig. 1A). The family of GATA factors is composed of GATA1–6 and an atypical TRPS1 (19Chen J.Q. Bao Y. Litton J. Xiao L. Zhang H.Z. Warneke C.L. Wu Y. Shen X. Wu S. Katz R.L. Sahin A. Bondy M. Murray J.L.

To identify which GATA factor potentially targets SOX2 promoter, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of 1762 breast cancer samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) at NCBI (20Barrett T. Troup D.B. Wilhite S.E. Ledoux P. Evangelista C. Kim I.F. Tomashevsky M. Marshall K.A. Phillippy K.H. Sherman P.M. Muertter R.N. Holko M. Ayanbule O. Yefanov A. Soboleva A.

GATA3 and TRPS1 were identified as two major GATA isoforms expressed in breast cancer. The expression of TRPS1 showed a significantly negative correlation with the SOX2 expression, suggesting that TRPS1 represses SOX2 expression (Fig. 1, B and C, and Fig. S1). This observation was consistent with the notion that TRPS1 has intrinsic transcriptional repression activity (22Malik T.H. Shoichet S.A. Latham P. Kroll T.G. Peters L.L. Shivdasani R.A. Transcriptional repression and developmental functions of the atypical vertebrate GATA protein TRPS1.EMBO J. 2001; 20 (11285235): 1715-172510.1093/emboj/20.7.1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Also, elevated expression of TRPS1 was observed in highly differentiated luminal breast cancers compared with less differentiated basal breast cancers (14Wu L. Wang Y. Liu Y. Yu S. Xie H. Shi X. Qin S. Ma F. Tan T.Z. Thiery J.P. Chen L. A central role for TRPS1 in the control of cell cycle and cancer development.Oncotarget. 2014; 5 (25277197): 7677-7690Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). SOX2 is believed to be a possible driver of the basal-like phenotype in sporadic breast cancers (23Rodriguez-Pinilla S.M. Sarrio D. Moreno-Bueno G. Rodriguez-Gil Y. Martinez M.A. Hernandez L. Hardisson D. Reis-Filho J.S. Palacios J. Sox2: a possible driver of the basal-like phenotype in sporadic breast cancer.Mod. Pathol. 2007; 20 (17334350): 474-48110.1038/modpathol.3800760Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that TRPS1 is a repressive factor for SOX2 expression and suppresses CSC functions. To test this hypothesis, which fits well with the current knowledge on TRPS1 and SOX2, we attempted to experimentally confirm that TRPS1 negatively regulates SOX2 expression. We silenced TRPS1 in T47D and MCF7 cells, which are breast cancer cell lines with elevated endogenous TRPS1 expression, and found that silencing TRPS1 led to up-regulation of SOX2 at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that TRPS1 represses SOX2 expression. To verify whether TRPS1 represses SOX2 expression by directly targeting the GATA-binding element in the SOX2 promoter, we performed the ChIP–quantitative PCR assay using TRPS1 antibodies in T47D and MCF7 cells. The results showed significant enrichment of TRPS1 at the SOX2 promoter (>5-fold enrichment) in both T47D and MCF7 cells using a well characterized untranscribed genomic region, Untr4, as a control (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, we carried out luciferase reporter assay and observed that ectopic overexpression of TRPS1 could significantly reduce the luciferase activity of the WT SOX2 promoter (WT–SOX2 promoter) and Mut1–SOX2 promoter with a mutation in the noncore TRPS1-binding element in the SOX2 promoter. The reduction in luciferase activity with overexpressed TRPS1 was lost in Mut2–SOX2 promoter with a mutation in the core TRPS1-binding consensus element GATA in the SOX2 promoter (Fig. 2B). Also, silencing TRPS1 significantly increased the luciferase activity of the SOX2 promoter in MCF7 cells (Fig. 2C). These observations indicated that TRPS1 repressed transcriptional activity of SOX2 promoter by targeting its GATA-binding element. Domain structure analysis revealed that TRPS1 contained three domains: a GATA-binding domain flanked with N-terminal and C-terminal domains. To further explore which domain in TRPS1 was important for its repressive function on SOX2 expression, we constructed several TRPS1 truncates and carried out luciferase reporter assay. The results showed that only full-length TRPS1 and a TRPS1 truncate with C-terminal domain together with the GATA domain were able to repress the transcriptional activity of the SOX2 promoter, indicating that C-terminal and GATA domains of TRPS1 were required for the TRPS1 transcriptional repression function on the SOX2 promoter (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results indicated that TRPS1 repressed SOX2 expression by directly targeting the GATA element in the SOX2 promoter. SOX2 is a key stem cell marker and has been shown to promote tumor initiation (2Boumahdi S. Driessens G. Lapouge G. Rorive S. Nassar D. Le Mercier M. Delatte B. Caauwe A. Lenglez S. Nkusi E.

As described above, TRPS1 targets SOX2 promoter to repress its expression (Figure 1, Figure 2). We therefore proposed that TRPS1 regulates CSC functions by repressing SOX2 expression. In addition to SOX2, other documented stem cell pluripotency markers include OCT4, KLF4, and NANOG (25Haase A. Olmer R. Schwanke K. Wunderlich S. Merkert S. Hess C. Zweigerdt R. Gruh I. Meyer J.

We investigated whether OCT4, KLF4, and NANOG were involved in the regulation of stemness of cancer cells by TRPS1. The expression of OCT4, KLF4, and NANOG upon TRPS1 silencing was analyzed and compared with that of SOX2. The results showed that only expression of SOX2 and not OCT4, KLF4, and NANOG was significantly up-regulated upon silencing TRPS1 (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2). To test whether the TRPS1–SOX2 axis contributed to CSC functions, we carried out an in vitro mammosphere formation assay considered to be the gold standard for testing CSC functions in vitro (28Dontu G. Al-Hajj M. Abdallah W.M. Clarke M.F. Wicha M.S. Stem cells in normal breast development and breast cancer.Cell Proliferation. 2003; 36 (14521516): 59-7210.1046/j.1365-2184.36.s.1.6.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 29Shaw F.L.

TRPS1 was successfully knocked down using specific anti-TRPS1 shRNA, and the increased SOX2 upon TRPS1 knockdown could be reversed by transfecting with additional anti-SOX2 shRNA (Fig. 3B). Moreover, overexpression of a shRNA-resistant TRPS1 rescued the SOX2 up-regulation caused by the TRPS1 knockdown (Fig. 3B). In a mammosphere assay, the results showed that silencing TRPS1 in MCF7 cells increased the number of mammospheres, whereas silencing SOX2 had an opposite effect. As expected, additional silencing of SOX2 in cells with the silenced TRPS1 fully restored the increased mammosphere formation ability of cells with silencing TRPS1 alone (Fig. 3C). These observations indicated that TRPS1 suppressed the sphere-forming ability of cancer cells by reducing the expression of SOX2. To further confirm the effects of the TRPS1–SOX2 axis on CSC functions, the CD44+/CD24− cell population, which is reported to have CSC properties, was investigated using flow cytometry. The results showed that silencing TRPS1 in MCF7 cells led to a significant increase in the CSC population (CD44+/CD24−) (up to ∼3-fold), whereas silencing SOX2 decreased the CSC population, and additional silencing SOX2 in cells with silenced TRPS1 fully restored the increased CSC population (Fig. 3D and Fig. S3). Also, CSCs isolated from MCF7 cells using FACS showed lower expression of TRPS1 and higher expression of SOX2 compared with those in other non-CSCs (Fig. S4). Consistently, highly purified CSCs (ALDH+/CD44+/CD24−) from breast cancer patient-derived xenografts expressed higher SOX2 and lower TRPS1 compared with other types of breast cancer cells (Fig. S5). These results provided further evidence that TRPS1 might suppress CSC function by repressing SOX2 expression in vitro. Tumor initiation ability with the transplantation of limiting dilutions of cancer cells is a direct and convincing evidence for CSC functions (30Singh S.K. Hawkins C. Clarke I.D. Squire J.A. Bayani J. Hide T. Henkelman R.M. Cusimano M.D. Dirks P.B.

We used xenograft tumor initiation models to validate that TRPS1 suppressed CSC functions by repressing SOX2 expression. Female SCID mice were subcutaneously injected with limiting dilutions of MCF7 cells (5 × 106, 5 × 105, and 5 × 104 cells) with silencing TRPS1 alone or with additional silencing of SOX2. The results showed that compared with mice treated with control shRNA, silencing TRPS1 resulted in decreased tumor latency and this phenotype was rescued by additionally silencing SOX2 (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, cells with silenced TRPS1 had a much greater ability and cells with additional silencing of SOX2 had a much smaller ability to form tumors as compared with controls (Fig. 4, A and B, and Table 1). These results suggested that TRPS1 inhibited CSC functions and suppressed breast tumor initiation by repressing SOX2.Table 1Tumor incidence of MCF7 cells expressing indicated shRNAsNumber of cellsTumor engraftment rateshControlshTRPS1shTRPS1 + shSOX25 × 1067/88/83/85 × 1054/86/81/85 × 1041/85/80/8p value vs. shControlaThe p value was obtained by Pearson's chi-squared test using ELDA software (40).0.0001070.00135p value vs. shTRPS1aThe p value was obtained by Pearson's chi-squared test using ELDA software (40).2e-11a The p value was obtained by Pearson's chi-squared test using ELDA software (40Hu Y.

Open table in a new tab We examined tumor growth in xenograft tumor models at two cell densities, 5 × 106 and 5 × 105, over a period of 6 weeks. We observed that silencing of TRPS1 suppressed tumor growth, which may indicate a different role of TRPS1 in the tumor promotion stage of oncogenesis (Fig. 4, C and D). Also, additional silencing of SOX2 with silencing TRPS1 further suppressed tumor growth compared with silencing with TRPS1 alone (Fig. 4, C and D). This observation was likely due to the delayed tumor formation upon silencing SOX2, which led to relatively short tumor growth time in xenograft mouse models. These discrepant results raise an interesting possibility of differential roles of TRPS1 in tumor initiation versus tumor promotion. These apparently conflicting results can be explained, at least in part, by the current notion of the proliferation ability of CSCs, which are critical for tumor initiation but show slow proliferation rate and self-renewal capabilities (32Vidal S.J.

The TRPS1 expression is believed to have a dynamic role in the process of tumor development (34Savinainen K.J. Linja M.J. Saramäki O.R. Tammela T.L. Chang G.T. Brinkmann A.O. Visakorpi T.

In this respect, we recently reported that TRPS1 promoted tumor growth by functioning as a scaffold to regulate USP4-directed HDAC2 deubiquitination. These observations provided a mechanistic insight into the tumor growth-promoting role of TRPS1 (35Wang Y.Z. Zhang J. Wu L.L. Liu W.G. Wei G.Y. Gong X. Liu Y. Ma Z.F. Ma F. Thiery J.P. Chen L.M.

Also, silencing both GATA3 and TRPS1 in MCF7 cells increased expression of SOX2 (Fig. S6). At this point, it is difficult to conclude whether GATA3 and TRPS1 compete or cooperate with each other in modulating SOX2 expression and CSC functions. However, our results, together with the fact that both GATA3 and TRPS1 recognize the GATA element, indicated that depending on the cellular context, both GATA3 and TRPS1 might target SOX2 to regulate SOX2 expression and CSC functions. It would be worthwhile to further explore the precise mechanism in the future. In conclusion, our current study has shown that TRPS1 recognizes SOX2 promoter and represses SOX2 expression, thereby suppressing CSC functions. Our results have demonstrated that the decreased expression of TRPS1, as a tumor suppressor, promotes SOX2 expression and tumor initiation (Fig. S7), providing new mechanistic insights into the regulation of SOX2 expression and CSC functions. Cell lines T47D, MCF7, and 293T were kind gifts from Drs. Zhao Bin, Zhu Tao, and Lin Chenqi. Cell lines T47D and MCF7 were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Wisent, catalog no. 350-000-CL) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, catalog no. SV30087.02) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Wisent, catalog no. 450-201-EL). The 293T cells were cultured under standard conditions in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Wisent, catalog no. 319-005-CL), 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All three cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator and used within 6 months. The cell lines were authenticated by the short tandem repeat typing. Trypsin/EDTA and PBS were purchased from Wisent Inc.

AF2018), TRPS1 (1:1000, R&D Systems, catalog no. AF4838), GATA3 (1:1000, Abcam, catalog no. ab199428), rabbit anti-DDDDK-Tag pAb (1:2500, ABclonal, catalog no. AE004), and β-actin (1:5000, ProteinTech, catalog no. 60008–1-lg). ChIP assay was performed according to the published method (39Lee T.I. Johnstone S.E. Young R.A. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray-based analysis of protein location.Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1 (17406303): 729-74810.1038/nprot.2006.98Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). T47D cells were treated with the siRNAs for 3 days to knock down TRPS1 expression. For each ChIP assay, 30 μl of Dynabeads® (Thermo Fisher) and 3 μg of TRPS1 antibody were incubated with 50 μl of cross-linked and sonicated chromatin. ChIP DNA was purified with a PCR cleanup kit (Axygen) and measured for enrichment by quantitative real-time PCR. The primer sequences for SOX2 were sense (5′-GGG GAG TGA TTA TGG GAA GA-3′) and antisense (5′-CCC TGG TCT ACC CTT ACT CA-3′), and the primer sequences for Untr4 were sense (5′-CTC CCT CCT GTG CTT CTC AG-3′) and antisense (5′-AAT GAA CGT GTC TCC CAG AA-3′). The WT and mutant SOX2 reporter constructs were generated by ligating synthetic sequences into pGL3-Basic. 293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates in triplicates, and plasmid transfection was performed when cells reached 80% confluency. Luciferase activity was measured after 48 h using the Dual-Luciferase reporter system (Promega, catalog no. E1910) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To obtain stable knockdown clones for TRPS1, SOX2, and the control scrambled shRNA, sequences were cloned into the pLKO.1 plasmid with AgeI and EcoRI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, AgeI catalog no. R0552L, EcoRI catalog no. R0101L). The sense strand of the most efficient TRPS–shRNA sequence was 5′-CCG GGC ACA CAG CTG CTA CAA ATG CCT CGA GGC ATT TGT AGC AGC TGT GTG CTT TTT G-3′. The sense strand of the shRNA sequence against SOX2 was 5′-CCG GCG CTC ATG AAG AAG GAT AAG TCT CG AGA CTT ATC CTT CTT CAT GAG CGT TTT TG-3′. The sense strand of the control shRNA sequence was 5′-CCG GTA AGG CTA TGA AGA GAT ACC TCG AGG TAT CTC TTC ATA GCC TTA TTT TTG-3′. 293T cells were transfected with the lentivirus vector and packaging plasmid mixes. Following 48 h of transfection, the viruses were produced and used for transfection into MCF7 cells. Following 12–16 h of incubation, the viruses were removed and replaced with fresh RPMI 1640. Stable MCF7 cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin (InvivoGen, catalog no. ant-pr-1) for 10 days. To rescue the knockdown phenotype, shRNA-resistant lines of TRPS1 mutant were generated from the MCF7 shRNA stable cell lines. For the TRPS1 mutant isoform, two silent mutations were introduced in the following sequence regions: A2521G and T2527A. MCF7 cells transfected with control shRNA, TRPS1 shRNA, SOX2 shRNA, or both TRPS1 shRNA and SOX2 shRNA were cultured at a density of 1,000 cells/ml in suspension in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F12 medium (Gibco, catalog no. 12400-024) supplemented with 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (R&D Systems, catalog no. 133-FB-025), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (PeproTech, catalog no. AF-100-15), insulin–transferrin–selenium (Sigma–Aldrich, catalog no. I3146), and B-27 supplement (Gibco, catalog no. 17504-044). The medium contained 0.5% methylcellulose (R&D Systems, catalog no. HSC001) for cell aggregation. Primary mammospheres were harvested and dissociated to single cells, counted, and reseeded for the second round of mammosphere formation. The colony numbers were counted manually under a microscope after 10 days of culturing. Numbers of mammospheres compared with the controls were represented as the means ± S.D. of three independent runs. The scale bar indicates 100 μm. MCF7 cells were resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/100 μl of staining buffer (1× PBS with 0.5% BSA) and incubated with primary antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. The primary antibodies were PE mouse anti-human CD24 (catalog no. 555428), APC mouse anti-human CD44 (catalog no. 559942), PE mouse IgG2a κ isotype control (catalog no. 559319), and APC mouse IgG2b κ isotype control (catalog no. 555745) (20 μl/test, BD Pharmingen). Three control groups were established for the first sorting: 1) cells labeled with the isotype antibodies of the above two antibodies, 2) cells labeled with the anti-CD44–APC antibody and the isotype control antibody for CD24, and 3) cells labeled with the anti-CD24–PE antibody and the isotype control antibody for CD44. The cells were washed with staining buffer and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. For flow cytometric analysis, the cells were resuspended in staining buffer. MCF7 cells were sorted using the BD FACSAriaTM II cell sorter (BD Biosciences). MCF-7 cells were transfected with indicated shRNAs (5 × 104, 5 × 105, 5 × 106 cells, n = 8/group), suspended in PBS, and mixed with Matrigel (1:1, BD Biosciences, catalog no. 354234). Tumor volume was measured every 3 days from the time tumor was palpable until the animals were sacrificed (week 6). Palpable tumor volumes and tumor volumes at the end point (week 6) were measured by width and length with a Vernier caliper and calculated by formula Volume = (Length × Width × Width)/2. SCID mice (BALB/cJNju-Foxn1nu/Nju) were purchased from Nanjing Biomedical Research Institute of Nanjing University. All animal studies were carried out in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals of Southeast University. The data sets of breast cancer patients were downloaded from the publicly available GEO databases using the BioProject ID PRJNA376644. The data were analyzed starting with the raw FASTQ files. After quality checking, alignment was performed with TopHat, and the reference was GRCh38 (hg38). The quantification of the genes was carried out with HTseq-count, and then the differential expression was called with DESeq. X. G., W. L., L. W., Z. M., Y. W., and J. Z. data curation; X. G., W.

https://openalex.org/W2949599758,"Many different transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression in a combinatorial fashion, often by binding in close proximity to each other on composite cis-regulatory DNA elements. Here, we investigated how ETS TFs bind with the AP1 TFs JUN–FOS at composite DNA-binding sites. DNA-binding ability with JUN–FOS correlated with the phenotype of ETS proteins in prostate cancer. We found that the oncogenic ETS-related gene (ERG) and ETS variant (ETV) 1/4/5 subfamilies co-occupy ETS–AP1 sites with JUN–FOS in vitro, whereas JUN–FOS robustly inhibited DNA binding by the tumor suppressors ETS homologous factor (EHF) and SAM pointed domain–containing ETS TF (SPDEF). EHF bound ETS–AP1 DNA with tighter affinity than ERG in the absence of JUN–FOS, possibly enabling EHF to compete with ERG and JUN–FOS for binding to ETS–AP1 sites. Genome-wide mapping of EHF- and ERG-binding sites in prostate epithelial cells revealed that EHF is preferentially excluded from closely spaced ETS–AP1 DNA sequences. Structural modeling and mutational analyses indicated that adjacent positively charged surfaces from EHF and JUN–FOS use electrostatic repulsion to disfavor simultaneous DNA binding. Conservation of positive residues on the JUN–FOS interface identified E74-like ETS TF 1 (ELF1) as an additional ETS TF exhibiting anticooperative DNA binding with JUN–FOS, and we found that ELF1 is frequently down-regulated in prostate cancer. In summary, divergent electrostatic features of ETS TFs at their JUN–FOS interface enable distinct binding events at ETS–AP1 DNA sites, which may drive specific targeting of ETS TFs to facilitate distinct transcriptional programs.

Yet, to maintain their effectiveness and to mitigate selection of herbicide-resistant weeds, the discovery of new resistance traits that use different chemical modes of action is essential. In plants, the Gretchen Hagen 3 (GH3) acyl acid amido synthetases catalyze the conjugation of amino acids to jasmonate and auxin phytohormones. This reaction chemistry has not been explored as a possible approach for herbicide modification and inactivation. Here, we examined a set of Arabidopsis GH3 proteins that use the auxins indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) as substrates along with the corresponding auxinic phenoxyalkanoic acid herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxylacetic acid (2,4-D) and 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid (2,4-DB). The IBA-specific AtGH3.15 protein displayed high catalytic activity with 2,4-DB, which was comparable to its activity with IBA. Screening of phenoxyalkanoic and phenylalkyl acids indicated that side-chain length of alkanoic and alkyl acids is a key feature of AtGH3.15’s substrate preference. The X-ray crystal structure of the AtGH3.15·2,4-DB complex revealed how the herbicide binds in the active site. In root elongation assays, Arabidopsis AtGH3.15-knockout and -overexpression lines grown in the presence of 2,4-DB exhibited hypersensitivity and tolerance, respectively, indicating that the AtGH3.15-catalyzed modification inactivates 2,4-DB. These findings suggest a potential use for AtGH3.15, and perhaps other GH3 proteins, as herbicide-modifying enzymes that employ a mode of action different from those of currently available herbicide-resistance traits.

https://openalex.org/W2896438622,"Although many anticancer agents for gastric cancer have been developed, the prognosis for many patients remains poor. Recently, costimulatory immune molecules that reactivate antitumor immune responses by utilizing the host immune system have attracted attention as new therapeutic strategies. CD137 is a costimulatory molecule that reportedly potentiates the antitumor activity of tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by enhancing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. However, it remains unclear whether CD137 stimulates tumor-regulatory activity in gastric cancer. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effects of CD137 stimulation on gastric cancer cells administered tumor-targeting mAbs. Our results showed that human natural killer (NK) cells were activated by expressing CD137 after encountering trastuzumab-coated gastric cancer cells, and that stimulation of activated NK cells in the presence of trastuzumab and recombinant human CD137 ligand (rhCD137L) enhanced cytotoxicity and release of cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF, granzyme A, or granzyme B) as compared with activated NK cells with trastuzumab alone (p < 0.05). By combination treatment with rhCD137L, similar effects were obtained regarding cancer cell cytotoxicity in the presence of cetuximab (p < 0.01). Moreover, we revealed that CD137 expression was dependent upon the affinity between the Fc portion of the antibodies and FcγRIIIa of NK cells based on results indicating that human IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses enhanced CD137 expression (p < 0.001). These results confirmed that FcγRIIIA polymorphisms (158 V/V) enhanced CD137 expression to a greater degree than 158 F polymorphisms (p = 0.014). Our results suggested that CD137 stimulation could promote the effects of tumor-targeting mAbs in gastric cancer, and that further investigation of antibody binding affinity and in vivo activities might improve therapeutic strategies related to the treatment of gastric cancer patients."

Recently, phosphoinositides were shown to play an important role in cilia assembly and disassembly. However, the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown. Here, we report that suppression of apical phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2], by overexpressing apically targeted PtdIns(4,5)P2 phosphatase or by knocking down type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (Pip5k1), leads to ciliogenesis defects and polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in zebrafish embryos that phenocopied inpp5e mutant, a Joubert syndrome model. We further demonstrate that decreased expression of apical PtdIns(4,5)P2 disrupted apical ezrin recruitment, F-actin organization, and basal body docking. Moreover, the ciliogenesis and polycystic kidney defects in PtdIns(4,5)P2-depleted embryos can be rescued by overexpression of ezrin. Finally, Pip5k1a overexpression rescued the ciliogenesis defects and PKD phenotypes in Inpp5e-depleted embryos. Taken together, our results reveal that apical PtdIns(4,5)P2 is essential for ciliogenesis and the prevention of PKD and suggest a novel possibility for treating PKD and other human ciliopathies.-Xu, W., Jin, M., Huang, W., Wang, H., Hu, R., Li, J., Cao, Y.

Production of influenza-specific Igs, specifically IgGs, is one of the major protective immune mechanisms against influenza viruses. In humans, N-glycosylation of IgGs plays a critical role in antigen binding and effector functions. The ferret is the most commonly used animal model for studying influenza pathogenesis, virus transmission, and vaccine development, but its IgG structure and functions remain largely undefined. Here we show that ferret IgGs are N-glycosylated and that their N-glycan structures are diverse. Using a comprehensive strategy based on MS and ultra-HPLC analyses in combination with exoglycosidase digestions, we assigned 42 N-glycan structures in ferret IgGs. We observed that N-glycans of ferret IgGs consist mainly of complex-type glycans, including some high-mannose and hybrid glycans, similar to those observed in human IgG. The complex-type glycans of ferret IgGs were primarily core-fucosylated. Furthermore, a fraction of N-glycans carried bisecting GlcNAc. Ferret IgGs also had a minor fraction of glycans carrying α2–6Neu5Ac(s). We noted that, unlike human IgG, ferret IgGs have αGal epitopes on some N-glycans. Interestingly, influenza A infection caused prominent changes in the N-glycans of ferret IgG, mainly because of an increase in bisecting GlcNAc and F1A2G0 and a corresponding decrease in F1A2G1. This suggests that the glycosylation of virus-specific IgG may play a role in its functionality.

https://openalex.org/W2896913988,"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) remains a massive burden in developing countries with increasing morbidity and mortality rates; it is also an important pathogen in the farming industry and is a leading cause of bacterial diarrhea. Our previous study showed that nanometer-sized inclusion bodies (IBs) of the fimbrial adhesin subunit protein (FaeG), mutation heat-stable enterotoxin a (mSTa), heat-labile enterotoxin b (LTb), and STb (nontargeting) fusion protein as an oral vaccine induced both systemic and mucosal immune responses. In this study, to enhance the protective efficacy to ETEC, we used Yersinia enterocolitica adhesive and M-cell-targeting peptides to analyze high-efficiency antigen-specific immune presentation in the gut. Here, we showed that immunization with the IBs of ETEC—FaeG-mSTa-LTb-STb—induced a specific systemic and mucosal immune response in the gut, whereas the combination of both targeting peptides resulted in the highest titer, protective immune response against ETEC. A lymphocyte proliferation assay has shown that the IBs induced immunologic memory. The specific antibody of the targeting groups could effectively neutralize toxins, thereby protecting the cells of the small intestine and reducing the level of cAMP and cGMP, and the groups with double targeting showed the best effect. The most important finding was that the targeting peptides stimulate the T helper (Th) cells through Th17 and Thl and that Thl cells dominated the cellular immune response. We found that the targeting peptide could also activate CD11c+ on lymphoid dendritic cells, which processed and presented antigens to T cells through Th1-mediated IFN-γ and IL-12, thereby enhancing the antibody titers.

https://openalex.org/W2896765558,"Calcium ions (Ca2+) play an important role in the toxicity of the cysteine-rich and cationic antifungal protein PAF from Penicillium chrysogenum: high extracellular Ca2+ levels reduce the toxicity of PAF in the sensitive model fungus Neurospora crassa in a concentration dependent way. However, little is known about the mechanistic details of the Ca2+ ion impact and the Ca2+ binding capabilities of PAF outside the fungal cell, which might be the reason for the activity loss. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations we demonstrated that PAF weakly, but specifically binds Ca2+ ions. MD simulations of PAF predicted one major Ca2+ binding site at the C-terminus involving Asp53 and Asp55, while Asp19 was considered as putative Ca2+ binding site. The exchange of Asp19 to serine had little impact on the Ca2+ binding, however caused the loss of antifungal activity, as was shown in our recent study. Now we replaced the C-terminal aspartates and expressed the serine variant PAFD53S/D55S. The specific Ca2+ binding affinity of PAFD53S/D55S decreased significantly if compared to PAF, whereas the antifungal activity was retained. To understand more details of Ca2+ interactions, we investigated the NMR and MD structure/dynamics of the free and Ca2+-bound PAF and PAFD53S/D55S. Though we found some differences between these protein variants and the Ca2+ complexes, these effects cannot explain the observed Ca2+ influence. In conclusion, PAF binds Ca2+ ions selectively at the C-terminus; however, this Ca2+ binding does not seem to play a direct role in the previously documented modulation of the antifungal activity of PAF."
https://openalex.org/W2897241859,"It is well known that proteins are built up from an alphabet of 20 different amino acid types. These suffice to enable the protein to fold into its operative form relevant to its required functional roles. For carrying out these allotted functions, there may in some cases be a need for post-translational modifications and it has been established that an additional three types of amino acid have at some point been recruited into this process. But it still remains the case that the 20 residue types referred to are the major building blocks in all terrestrial proteins, and probably ""universally"". Given this fact, it is surprising that no satisfactory answer has been given to the two questions: ""why 20?"" and ""why just these 20?"". Furthermore, a suggestion is made as to how these 20 map to the codon repertoire which in principle has the capacity to cater for 64 different residue types. Attempts are made in this paper to answer these questions by employing a combination of quantum chemical and chemoinformatic tools which are applied to the standard 20 amino acid types as well as 3 “non-standard” types found in nature, a set of fictitious but feasible analog structures designed to test the need for greater coverage of function space and the collection of candidate alternative structures found either on meteorites or in experiments designed to reconstruct pre-life scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2897386224,"Background Major lower-limb amputation (LLA) predisposes patients post-operatively to a significant decline in daily-life functioning. The physical condition of amputee patients prior to surgery is significantly deteriorated due to chronic peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and diabetes, which accounts for the majority of LLAs in the adult population. A common strategy called pre-rehabilitation has been used in multiple patient populations to prepare the patient for undergoing a surgical event and to improve post-operative patient outcomes. Pre-rehabilitation might enhance the outcome of dysvascular LLA patients and reduce the high post-operative mortality rates. However, experience of experts with pre-rehabilitation and feasibility of a pre-rehabilitation program in this group remains unknown. Objective To investigate the experiences of medical professionals and researchers in the field of LLA with the use of pre-rehabilitation in general and in particular PVD patients. Additionally, the study examines their opinions regarding need for and feasibility of a pre-rehabilitation program for dysvascular patients at risk for an LLA. Methods Two explorative focus group discussions were organized with in total 16 experts in the field of treatment and research of LLA. Transcribed data were coded using the Atlas.ti software package. Thematic analysis with inductive approach was opted to arrange and interpret codes. Results The experiences of the experts with pre-rehabilitation in dysvascular patients were scarce. The experts described dysvascular patients at risk for an LLA as a difficult group for pre-rehabilitation due to short time window prior to surgery, older age, multiple co-morbidities and lack of motivation for behavioral change. The experts concluded that a pre-rehabilitation program should focus on patients who have sufficient time in advance before the amputation for pre-rehabilitation and who are motivated to participate. Conclusion Although in general the effects of pre-rehabilitation are promising, pre-operative rehabilitation in dysvascular patients at risk for an LLA seems not feasible. Future research could focus on a better monitoring of dysvascular patients and the development of pre-rehabilitation in subgroups of younger dysvascular LLA patients."

Bacteria biosynthesize NulOs among which are several related prokaryotic-specific isomers and one of which, N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid), is common among all vertebrates. Bacteria display various NulO carbohydrates on lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the identities of these molecules tune host–pathogen recognition mechanisms. The opportunistic bacterial pathogen Vibrio vulnificus possesses the genes for NulO biosynthesis; however, the structures and functions of the V. vulnificus NulO glycan are unknown. Using genetic and chemical approaches, we show here that the major NulO produced by a clinical V. vulnificus strain CMCP6 is 5-N-acetyl-7-N-acetyl-d-alanyl-legionaminic acid (Leg5Ac7AcAla). The CMCP6 strain could catabolize modified legionaminic acid, whereas V. vulnificus strain YJ016 produced but did not catabolize a NulO without the N-acetyl-d-alanyl modification. In silico analysis suggested that Leg5Ac7AcAla biosynthesis follows a noncanonical pathway but appears to be present in several bacterial species. Leg5Ac7AcAla contributed to bacterial outer-membrane integrity, as mutant strains unable to produce or incorporate Leg5Ac7AcAla into the LPS have increased membrane permeability, sensitivity to bile salts and antimicrobial peptides, and defects in biofilm formation. Using the crustacean model, Artemia franciscana, we demonstrate that Leg5Ac7AcAla-deficient bacteria have decreased virulence potential compared with WT. Our data indicate that different V. vulnificus strains produce multiple NulOs and that the modified legionaminic acid Leg5Ac7AcAla plays a critical role in the physiology, survivability, and pathogenicity of V. vulnificus CMCP6.

Although significant work has investigated the role of sialic acid in molecular mimicry and host evasion, the chemical composition and role of bacteria-specific NulOs in host–pathogen interactions remain under-explored. In addition to the seven isomers of the prokaryote-specific NulOs described, these carbohydrates can display various functionalized N- and O-substitutions such as acetylation. These diverse modifications may further contribute to multiple pathogen–host interaction mechanisms in vivo and in the environment (38Matthew Z. Kiefel M.

Previous work from our group confirmed that strains of V. vulnificus, a marine bacterium and human opportunistic pathogen, produced NulOs; however, the genomic region responsible for the NulO biosynthesis was highly variable within the species (Fig. 2A) (39Lewis A.L. Lubin J.B. Argade S. Naidu N. Choudhury B. Boyd E.F. Genomic and metabolic profiling of nonulosonic acids in Vibrionaceae reveal biochemical phenotypes of allelic divergence in Vibrio vulnificus.Appl. Environ.

One study fully elucidated the inner core of the LPS from the V. vulnificus strain ATCC 27562, which was found to have pseudaminic acid as a carbohydrate component (40Vinogradov E. Wilde C. Anderson E.M. Nakhamchik A. Lam J.S. Rowe-Magnus D.A. Structure of the lipopolysaccharide core of Vibrio vulnificus type strain 27562.Carbohydr. Res. 2009; 344 (19185290): 484-49010.1016/j.carres.2008.12.017Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of V. vulnificus strains with divergent NulO biosynthetic loci revealed that highly variable levels of NulO were produced depending on the genotype; however, no detailed NulO structural information was elucidated (39Lewis A.L. Lubin J.B. Argade S. Naidu N. Choudhury B. Boyd E.F. Genomic and metabolic profiling of nonulosonic acids in Vibrionaceae reveal biochemical phenotypes of allelic divergence in Vibrio vulnificus.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2011; 77 (21724895): 5782-579310.1128/AEM.00712-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Two V. vulnificus strains in particular, CMCP6 and YJ016, were studied in more detail. These two strains are nearly identical; however, the NulO biosynthetic region is unrelated (Fig. 2A). V. vulnificus strains with the CMCP6-like NulO genes produce ∼100-fold more NulO than strains with the YJ016-like genes (41Lubin J.B. Lewis W.G. Gilbert N.M. Weimer C.M. Almagro-Moreno S. Boyd E.F. Lewis A.L. Host-like carbohydrates promote bloodstream survival of Vibrio vulnificus in vivo.Infect. Immun. 2015; 83 (26015477): 3126-313610.1128/IAI.00345-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Efforts from our laboratory to connect the genetic NulO fingerprint with V. vulnificus pathogenicity revealed that NulO-deficient mutants have significantly increased sensitivity to the bacterial antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B (PmB), defects in swimming and biofilm formation, and are attenuated in a mouse bloodstream model of infection (41Lubin J.B. Lewis W.G. Gilbert N.M. Weimer C.M. Almagro-Moreno S. Boyd E.F. Lewis A.L. Host-like carbohydrates promote bloodstream survival of Vibrio vulnificus in vivo.Infect. Immun. 2015; 83 (26015477): 3126-313610.1128/IAI.00345-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The extent of bacterial bloodstream survival and dissemination was proportional to the amount of NulO expressed by the WT strain (NulO expression: CMCP6 ≫ YJ016) (41Lubin J.B. Lewis W.G. Gilbert N.M. Weimer C.M. Almagro-Moreno S. Boyd E.F. Lewis A.L. Host-like carbohydrates promote bloodstream survival of Vibrio vulnificus in vivo.Infect. Immun. 2015; 83 (26015477): 3126-313610.1128/IAI.00345-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, V. vulnificus, mutants in the NulO biosynthetic pathway were defective in virulence (42Yamamoto M. Kashimoto T. Tong P. Xiao J. Sugiyama M. Inoue M. Matsunaga R. Hosohara K. Nakata K. Yokota K. Oguma K. Yamamoto K. Signature-tagged mutagenesis of Vibrio vulnificus.J. Vet. Med. Sci. 2015; 77 (25755021): 823-82810.1292/jvms.14-0655Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Given the correlation between NulO display and bacterial pathogenesis, we chemically characterized the carbohydrate biosynthesized in strain CMCP6, which produces higher levels of NulO (39Lewis A.L. Lubin J.B. Argade S. Naidu N. Choudhury B. Boyd E.F. Genomic and metabolic profiling of nonulosonic acids in Vibrionaceae reveal biochemical phenotypes of allelic divergence in Vibrio vulnificus.Appl. Environ.

Host-like carbohydrates promote bloodstream survival of Vibrio vulnificus in vivo.Infect. Immun. 2015; 83 (26015477): 3126-313610.1128/IAI.00345-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We found that a modified legionaminic acid is produced in strain CMCP6, with an N-acetyl-d-alanyl group at C-7 (Leg5Ac7AcAla, Fig. 1). Through gene deletion analysis, we demonstrate that the modified Leg, 5-N-acetyl-7-d-alanyl-legionaminic acid (Leg5Ac7Ala), lacking an acetyl group, is catabolized via the canonical sialic acid pathway. Further analysis of deletion mutants demonstrate that biosynthesis of the acetylated d-alanine carbohydrate is essential for outer membrane integrity, stress survival, and virulence in the brine shrimp model Artemia franciscana. To begin to determine the structure of V. vulnificus NulOs embedded in the sequence and genomic organization of the biosynthesis pathways, we first investigated whether the NulO biosynthesis genomic loci were homologous to previously characterized pathways. The predicted biosynthesis operon of strain CMCP6 was similar in gene arrangement and amino acid composition with the biosynthetic region from Escherichia coli O161 (Fig. 2B). Specifically, the Nab1, Nab2, and Nab3 proteins of CMCP6 shared 54, 81, and 73% amino acid identity with Lea7, Lea4, and Lea5 of E. coli O161. The LPS from E. coli O161 contains a 5-N-acetyl-7-d-alanyl-legionaminic acid (Leg5Ac7Ala) (43Li X. Perepelov A.V. Wang Q. Senchenkova S.N. Liu B. Shevelev S.D. Guo X. Shashkov A.S. Chen W. Wang L. Knirel Y.A. Structural and genetic characterization of the O-antigen of Escherichia coli O161 containing a derivative of a higher acidic diamino sugar, legionaminic acid.Carbohydr. Res. 2010; 345 (20510395): 1581-158710.1016/j.carres.2010.04.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Leg5Ac7Ala is modified with a d-alanine at C-7 compared with the typical acetamido group in legionaminic acid (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the operon of CMCP6 contained a putative N-acetyltransferase (i.e. nab5), which was absent from the E. coli operon (Fig. 2B). We hypothesized that this N-acetyltransferase would acetylate the free amine of the d-alanine, resulting in a NulO with a 7-N-acetyl-d-alanyl modification at C-7 (Fig. 2C). To determine whether CMCP6 does in fact produce this modified Leg, the NulOs were released from CMCP6 via mild acid hydrolysis in 2 n acetic acid, derivatized with the fluorescent molecule 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylene dioxybenzene (DMB), and separated via HPLC as described previously (Fig. 3A) (41Lubin J.B. Lewis W.G. Gilbert N.M. Weimer C.M. Almagro-Moreno S. Boyd E.F. Lewis A.L. Host-like carbohydrates promote bloodstream survival of Vibrio vulnificus in vivo.Infect.

Discovery and characterization of sialic acid O-acetylation in group B Streptococcus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The derivatized NulO was collected and analyzed by electrospray ionization MS (ESI-MS). The [M + H]+ of 522.17 m/z as well as the [M + Na]+ of 544.21 m/z from the NulO peak were consistent with the predicted modification that corresponds to a derivatized NulO modified with acetylated alanine (Leg5Ac7AcAla) (Fig. 3C). To characterize in more detail the native NulO structure, the LPS of WT CMCP6 was purified via the hot water/phenol method (45Westphal O. Jann K. Extraction with Phenol-Water and Further Applications of the Procedure.in: BeMiller J.N. Methods in Carbohydrate Chemistry. Academic Press, New York1965: 83-91Google Scholar), and the NulO was released from purified LPS of CMCP6 in 6% acetic acid for 4 h at 100 °C. The hydrolysate was separated by size-exclusion chromatography. The fractions containing NulOs, as indicated by staining with p-anisaldehyde via thin-layer LC (TLC), were collected and analyzed via high-resolution LC–MS (HR LCMS) to confirm the presence and identity of the native carbohydrate (Fig. 4). The expected ionization pattern for the native NulO (Leg5Ac7AcAla) was confirmed via HR LCMS to include the dehydrated mass [M − 18]+ of 388 m/z, [M + H]+ of 406 m/z, and [M + Na]+ of 428 m/z (Fig. 4). Detailed structural 1H NMR and 13C NMR analyses were conducted on the native NulO (Leg5Ac7AcAla) fractions. 460 mg of LPS was purified from 45 liters of culture, and the LPS was hydrolyzed in acetic acid to release the NulOs, which were further purified for NMR characterization in D2O (Fig. S2, A–D). The NMR analysis revealed the presence of the corresponding CH3 of the alanine functionality upfield (∼1.5 ppm) from hydrogens attached to α-carbon downfield (∼3.9 ppm) as indicated via 2D 1H NMR analysis (Fig. S2, C and D). These signature chemical shifts confirmed that the NulO produced by V. vulnificus CMCP6 contained an alanyl functionality. In tandem with the MS data and genomic analysis, the NulO structure was determined to be 5-N-acetyl-7-N-acetyl-d-alanyl-legionaminic acid (Leg5Ac7AcAla) (Fig. 2C). Our previous studies demonstrated that there are variable amounts of NulO produced depending on the genotype of V. vulnificus strains. In particular, strain CMCP6 produces 100-fold more NulO than YJ016 under the same culture conditions (Fig. 5, A and B) (41Lubin J.B. Lewis W.G. Gilbert N.M. Weimer C.M. Almagro-Moreno S. Boyd E.F. Lewis A.L. Host-like carbohydrates promote bloodstream survival of Vibrio vulnificus in vivo.Infect.

When characterizing the biosynthetic loci of these strains, the Δnab1 deletion resulted in the opposite phenotype in which YJ016 produced more NulO than CMCP6. The Nab1 enzyme is a cytidine monophosphate (CMP)–NulO synthetase and catalyzes the transfer of CMP from CTP to activate the NulO for use by a downstream glycosyltransferase, ultimately linking the sugar to LPS (46Schoenhofen I.C. Vinogradov E. Whitfield D.M. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. The CMP-legionaminic acid pathway in campylobacter: biosynthesis involving novel GDP-linked precursors.Glycobiology. 2009; 19 (19282391): 715-72510.1093/glycob/cwp039Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). No detectable NulO was observed in the HPLC analysis of DMB-derivatized total cellular fractions of the CMCP6 Δnab1 mutant (Fig. 5C), suggesting that the Leg5Ac7AcAla is catabolized by this strain. Conversely, in the YJ016 Δnab1 we observe accumulation of a NulO eluting at ∼14 min, which suggests that this carbohydrate is not catabolized (Fig. 5D). Mass spectrometry analysis of the"

Although most biochemical and cellular studies have been conducted with the TG2 (G224) form, the TG2 (G224V) form has recently emerged as a putative natural variant of TG2. In this study, we characterized the putative natural form of TG2, TG2 (G224V), and through a new crystal structure of TG2 (G224V), we revealed how TG2 (G224V) gained stability and higher Ca2+-dependent activity than an artificial variant of TG2 (G224)."

This study aimed to gather the experiences and opinions of people who have experienced admission to a psychiatric ward in order to grasp their reaction to, and understanding of, the legislation behind the involuntary admission of psychiatric patients. A web-based questionnaire survey was conducted with a total of 379 participants, using a cross-sectional, exploratory design. The data were analyzed using a chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, and a logistic regression analysis. According to the results, many patients were satisfied with their treatment during psychiatric admission; however, only few participants said that they had been given an adequate explanation for their involuntary treatment. Most participants expected qualified assistance after discharge, although the prospect of a regular visit from an official was not entirely supported by the participants. Patient satisfaction was relevant to the discussion of their needs after discharge and in developing a crisis plan during admission. These findings suggest that psychiatric patients accept inpatient treatment as long as they receive an adequate explanation. More qualified care such as relapse prevention would be expected to lead to better satisfaction. For them to welcome regular visits from an official, patients may need more information and discussion."
