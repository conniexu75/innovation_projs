These data permit deconvolution of regulatory networks connecting regulatory elements and transcriptional drivers to single-cell gene expression programs, significantly extending our understanding of human neurogenesis, cortical evolution, and the cellular basis of neuropsychiatric disease. We tie cell-cycle progression with early cell fate decisions during neurogenesis, demonstrating that differentiation occurs on a transcriptomic continuum; rather than only expressing a few transcription factors that drive cell fates, differentiating cells express broad, mixed cell-type transcriptomes before telophase. By mapping neuropsychiatric disease genes to cell types, we implicate dysregulation of specific cell types in ASD, ID, and epilepsy. We developed CoDEx, an online portal to facilitate data access and browsing.

The human cortex is composed of billions of cells estimated to encompass hundreds or thousands of distinct cell types, each with unique functions (Silbereis et al., 2016Silbereis J.C. Pochareddy S.

The availability of high-quality tissue and advances in single-cell transcriptomic technologies permit us to catalog the cell-type diversity of the human cortex in a comprehensive and unbiased manner (Ecker et al., 2017Ecker J.R.

Advances in technology and throughput (e.g., Drop-seq; Macosko et al., 2015Macosko E.Z. Basu A. Satija R. Nemesh J. Shekhar K. Goldman M. Tirosh I. Bialas A.R. Kamitaki N. Martersteck E.M. et al.Highly Parallel Genome-wide Expression Profiling of Individual Cells Using Nanoliter Droplets.Cell. 2015; 161: 1202-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3655) Google Scholar) allow us to analyze an order of magnitude more cells to complement and extend these studies, providing a deeper picture of human cortical development and its perturbation in disease. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define cell types and compile cell-type transcriptomes in the developing human neocortex. We focus on the cortical anlage at mid-gestation (gestation week [GW] 17 to GW18) (Figure 1A), because this period contains the major germinal zones and the developing cortical laminae containing migrating and newly born neurons, and neurodevelopmental processes occurring during this epoch are implicated in neuropsychiatric disease (de la Torre-Ubieta et al., 2016de la Torre-Ubieta L.

The road to precision psychiatry: translating genetics into disease mechanisms.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1397-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To optimize detection of distinct cell types, we separated the cortex into the germinal zones (ventricular zone [VZ] and subventricular zone [SVZ]) and developing cortex (subplate [SP] and cortical plate [CP]) before single-cell isolation. Using Drop-seq (Macosko et al., 2015Macosko E.Z. Basu A. Satija R. Nemesh J. Shekhar K. Goldman M. Tirosh I. Bialas A.R. Kamitaki N. Martersteck E.M. et al.Highly Parallel Genome-wide Expression Profiling of Individual Cells Using Nanoliter Droplets.Cell. 2015; 161: 1202-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3655) Google Scholar), we obtained and compared high-quality profiles for ∼40,000 cells from human cortex (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1B; Tables S1, S2, and S3) and a small subset with microfluidic approaches (Fluidigm) for technical comparisons. We first applied unbiased clustering based on t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE; see STAR Methods) and spectral K nearest-neighbor graph-based clustering (Butler et al., 2018Butler A. Hoffman P. Smibert P. Papalexi E. Satija R. Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (4155) Google Scholar), identifying 16 transcriptionally distinct cell groups. Cell types originated from the expected anatomical source and clustered by biological cell type, rather than batch or technical artifacts (Figures 1B–1G, S1C, and S1D). We identified multiple groups of cells at different stages of neuronal differentiation and maturation, corresponding to all known major cell types at this developmental period (Figures 1B–1F and S1E; Table S4). Clusters contained between 50 and 2,000 cells. The smallest cluster captured, which belonged to microglia, was composed of ∼50 cells. Other small clusters for oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs), endothelia, and pericytes were composed of 306, 237, and 114 cells, respectively (Figure 1G; Table S4). Clusters were reproducible and robust, as ascertained by bootstrapping (Figure S1F). Ordering of cells by pseudo-time in an unbiased manner using Monocle 2, a computational method that performs lineage trajectory reconstruction based on single-cell transcriptomics data (Qiu et al., 2017Qiu X.

Rinn J.L. The dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions are revealed by pseudotemporal ordering of single cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar), confirmed the predicted developmental trajectory (Figures 1H and 1I). For example, it is possible to observe the ordered transitions between different neural progenitor types and maturing glutamatergic neurons, with radial glia (RG) transitioning to intermediate progenitors (IPs) and IPs transitioning to newborn migrating neurons (Figure 1I). We observed that cell-type detection appears to be more sensitive to the number of cells profiled than the sequencing depth (Figures S2A–S2D). Furthermore, although each cell profile is an incomplete representation of that cell type (Lun et al., 2016Lun A.T. Bach K. Marioni J.C. Pooling across cells to normalize single-cell RNA sequencing data with many zero counts.Genome Biol. 2016; 17: 75Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar; Figures S2E and S2F), pooling transcriptomes within cells of a given type provides more complete cell-type transcriptome representations. We iteratively subsampled cells from clusters to empirically assess the completeness of cell-type signatures with different sample sizes (Figure S2G). At a depth of 40,000 cells, we obtain stable transcriptomes representing 3,000–5,000 genes for most cell types present (Table S4). Comparison of these data with a method using lower throughput and higher sequencing depth (Fluidigm C1) (Nowakowski et al., 2017Nowakowski T.J. Bhaduri A. Pollen A.A. Alvarado B. Mostajo-Radji M.A. Di Lullo E. Haeussler M. Sandoval-Espinosa C. Liu S.J. Velmeshev D. et al.Spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories reveal developmental hierarchies of the human cortex.Science. 2017; 358: 1318-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar; Figure S3) revealed that the ability to leverage an order of magnitude more cells yielded more stable mRNA transcript profiles for a given cell type (Figures S3A–S3C). Integration of our dataset with the largest previous study (4,000 cells; Nowakowski et al., 2017Nowakowski T.J. Bhaduri A. Pollen A.A. Alvarado B. Mostajo-Radji M.A. Di Lullo E. Haeussler M. Sandoval-Espinosa C. Liu S.J. Velmeshev D. et al.Spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories reveal developmental hierarchies of the human cortex.Science. 2017; 358: 1318-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) using canonical correlation analysis (Butler et al., 2018Butler A. Hoffman P. Smibert P. Papalexi E. Satija R. Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (4155) Google Scholar) showed substantial alignment of cells between the two datasets (Figures S3D and S3E). This is the first direct comparison of different human fetal single-cell datasets, and it demonstrates the reproducibility of these expression profiles and significantly extends them by providing more stable gene expression rankings. We provide these cell-type-specific expression profiles with annotated gene expression ranking confidence measures for each cell type (Table S4) and a web interface, CoDEx (Cortical Development Expression Viewer), for browsing these data (http://geschwindlab.dgsom.ucla.edu/pages/codexviewer). Comparison of scRNA-seq datasets to bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) expression profiles (de la Torre-Ubieta et al., 2018de la Torre-Ubieta L. Stein J.L. Won H. Opland C.K. Liang D. Lu D. Geschwind D.H. The Dynamic Landscape of Open Chromatin during Human Cortical Neurogenesis.Cell. 2018; 172: 289-304.e18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) showed consistently that gene expression profiles generated using different scRNA-seq methodologies across different laboratories strongly correlated with bulk RNA-seq gene expression profiles (Spearman 0.69–0.83) (Figures S4A and S4B). However, we observed that approximately 400 protein-coding genes representing longer, brain-enriched, cell adhesion molecules involved in neuronal development (Figures S4E–S4H) were consistently under-represented in single-cell datasets compared with bulk tissue RNA-seq (Figures S4C and S4D). Overall comparison of expression of canonical cell-type marker genes showed similar expression levels compared with bulk tissue RNA-seq (Figure S4I), indicating that despite small biases in gene detection shared across scRNA-seq methods, the relative frequencies of major cell types were not over- or under-represented, further demonstrating the robustness of the scRNA-seq dataset (Figure S4). We next reasoned we could use the depth of our dataset to identify cell states and cell subtypes not identified in previous studies with smaller cell numbers. We performed an additional round of clustering on each major cell cluster (Figure 2; Table S5; STAR Methods), which finely resolved maturation states during neurogenesis and identified multiple cell subtypes not previously characterized in single-cell datasets in humans: SP neurons (Figure 2D), distinct subtypes of glutamatergic neurons (Figure 2D), early parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, and NPY expressing SST interneurons (Figure 2C). A previous study profiling ∼2,300 cells from developing human cortex did not detect PV interneurons and suggested PV interneurons may not develop until after GW26 (Zhong et al., 2018Zhong S. Zhang S. Fan X. Wu Q. Yan L. Dong J. Zhang H. Li L. Sun L. Pan N. et al.A single-cell RNA-seq survey of the developmental landscape of the human prefrontal cortex.Nature. 2018; 555: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Here, we find that at mid-gestation (GW17–GW18), PV interneurons comprise ∼0.1% of the total population, underscoring how necessary larger datasets are to identify rare cell types. The provenance of human neocortical interneurons has been disputed (Hansen et al., 2013Hansen D.V. Lui J.H. Flandin P. Yoshikawa K. Rubenstein J.L. Alvarez-Buylla A. Kriegstein A.R.

Zhang S. Fan X. Wu Q. Yan L. Dong J. Zhang H. Li L. Sun L. Pan N. et al.A single-cell RNA-seq survey of the developmental landscape of the human prefrontal cortex.Nature. 2018; 555: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We observed no clusters of progenitors expressing markers of interneurons and no clusters of interneurons expressing mitotic or progenitor markers (Figure S1E). In addition, subclustering of interneurons did not identify a cell population displaying characteristics of interneuron progenitors. OLIG2 is a marker of both medial ganglionic eminence progenitors and OPCs (Miyoshi et al., 2007Miyoshi G. Butt S.J. Takebayashi H. Fishell G. Physiologically distinct temporal cohorts of cortical interneurons arise from telencephalic Olig2-expressing precursors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7786-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We observed OLIG2+ cells only in the OPC cluster that express other OPC markers but do not express interneuron marker genes (Figure S1E). Thus, even with the order-of-magnitude-greater cell depth and increased ability to detect low-abundance cell types (e.g., 0.1%), we do not find evidence of a neocortical interneuron progenitor during mid-gestation in humans. We next sought to gain insight into cell-type-specific regulatory programs by comparing transcription factor (TF) expression across major cell types. We found previously characterized TFs and co-factors enriched in their corresponding cell types (Figures 1F and 3A ) and multiple TFs and co-factors that have not been associated with specific neocortical cell types (Figure 3). These TFs also displayed laminae-specific expression in a bulk tissue laser-capture micro-dissected (LCM) expression dataset (Miller et al., 2014Miller J.A. Ding S.L. Sunkin S.M. Smith K.A. Ng L. Szafer A. Ebbert A. Riley Z.L. Royall J.J. Aiona K. et al.Transcriptional landscape of the prenatal human brain.Nature. 2014; 508: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar) and temporal trajectories similar to canonical cell-type markers (Figures 3B and S5A). To validate predictions for these putative novel cell-type markers, we performed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which confirmed laminae-specific expression of each of the TFs and co-factors tested: ZFHX4 and CARHSP1 in neural progenitors and CSRP2 in excitatory neurons (Figures 3C–3H). Of particular interest was ZFHX4, which has been previously associated with 8q21.11 microdeletion syndrome (Palomares et al., 2011Palomares M. Delicado A. Mansilla E. de Torres M.L. Vallespín E. Fernandez L. Martinez-Glez V. García-Miñaur S. Nevado J. Simarro F.S. et al.Characterization of a 8q21.11 microdeletion syndrome associated with intellectual disability and a recognizable phenotype.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2011; 89: 295-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our data localize ZFHX4 specifically to neural progenitors in the developing human neocortex for the first time (Figures 3A–3E), implicating specific dysregulation of neural progenitors as the mechanism underlying this syndrome. The TF ST18 appeared to partially cluster with SP markers (Figures 2D, 4A, and 4 B; Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2015Hoerder-Suabedissen A. Molnár Z.

We found that SP markers previously defined in other species were not uniquely expressed in the SP in another fetal gene expression atlas (Miller et al., 2014Miller J.A. Ding S.L. Sunkin S.M. Smith K.A. Ng L. Szafer A. Ebbert A. Riley Z.L. Royall J.J. Aiona K. et al.Transcriptional landscape of the prenatal human brain.Nature. 2014; 508: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar; Figures 4B and 4C). We identified SP-enriched genes in this cortical laminar atlas (Figure 4C; STAR Methods), which showed strong overlap with ST18 (Figure 4B). Subclustering separated deep-layer neurons from the ST18-expressing SP neurons (Figure 4D). Genes enriched in the SP neuron cluster, or highly correlated with ST18, display strong SP enrichment in the cortical laminae dataset, verifying our capture of SP neurons and identification of many additional SP neuron markers (Figures 4E–4H). In addition, we performed RNA FISH to confirm SP-specific expression of ST18 (Figure 4I). This represents the first transcriptomic characterization of human SP neurons at single-cell resolution. We next reasoned that we could begin to leverage these single-cell data to uncover some cellular and molecular mechanisms driving human cortical evolution by determining whether specific cell types were enriched with genes showing human specific expression trajectories (hSET) in bulk tissue (Bakken et al., 2016Bakken T.E. Miller J.A. Ding S.L. Sunkin S.M. Smith K.A. Ng L. Szafer A. Dalley R.A. Royall J.J. Lemon T. et al.A comprehensive transcriptional map of primate brain development.Nature. 2016; 535: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar; see STAR Methods). We observed the strongest enrichment of hSET genes in outer RG (oRG) and the excitatory upper-layer-enriched cluster (Figure S5B). Both of these cell types represent processes central to both neocortical expansion (Lui et al., 2011Lui J.H. Hansen D.V. Kriegstein A.R. Development and evolution of the human neocortex.Cell. 2011; 146: 18-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) and elaboration of cortical connectivity in humans (Fame et al., 2011Fame R.M.

Among the approximately 600 genes with oRG-enriched expression, we identified LYN, a Src tyrosine kinase previously implicated in neuronal polarization and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) signaling (Hayashi et al., 1999Hayashi T.

Chromosomal DNA is sequestered from the cytoplasm by the nuclear envelope during interphase, but in mitosis, the nuclear envelope breaks down, and chromosomes promote spindle assembly (Zierhut and Funabiki, 2015Zierhut C. Funabiki H. Nucleosome functions in spindle assembly and nuclear envelope formation.BioEssays. 2015; 37: 1074-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As spindle assembly and functional nuclear formation depend on nucleosomes, we speculated that this nucleosome-dependency ensured that assembly of these structures is limited to self-chromosomes, discriminating them from foreign pathogenic DNA (Zierhut and Funabiki, 2015Zierhut C.

Unlike fertilization, when nucleosome-free sperm DNA is rapidly chromatinized in egg cytoplasm, in somatic cells invading pathogenic DNA is sensed by pattern-recognition receptors such as cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) (Chen et al., 2016Chen Q.

How does chromosomal DNA normally insulate itself from cGAS? While the nuclear envelope may limit access of cGAS to chromosomes in interphase, cGAS can be recruited to chromosomes during mitosis (Gentili et al., 2019Gentili M. Lahaye X. Nadalin F. Nader G.P.F.

Chen Q. Chen Z.J. cGAS is essential for cellular senescence.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: E4612-E4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Given the stability of cGAMP (Eaglesham et al., 2019Eaglesham J.B. Pan Y. Kupper T.S. Kranzusch P.J. Viral and metazoan poxins are cGAMP-specific nucleases that restrict cGAS-STING signalling.Nature. 2019; 566: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), unless cGAS is silenced during mitosis, it could trigger inflammatory transcription upon mitotic exit. Similarly, in interphase, cases have been reported, where cGAS can reside in the nucleus, but cGAS activation is attenuated (Gentili et al., 2019Gentili M. Lahaye X. Nadalin F. Nader G.P.F. Puig Lombardi E. Herve S. De Silva N.S. Rookhuizen D.C. Zueva E.

The mechanism underlying this attenuation is not understood. Taxane drugs, such as Taxol (paclitaxel), which stabilize microtubules and interfere with mitosis, are commonly used in cancer chemotherapy. However, how microtubule stabilization is transferred into anti-cancer effects has remained elusive (Mitchison et al., 2017Mitchison T.J. Pineda J. Shi J. Florian S. Is inflammatory micronucleation the key to a successful anti-mitotic cancer drug?.Open Biol. 2017; 7: 170182Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, Mitchison, 2012Mitchison T.J.

Cell. 2014; 25: 2677-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). When proliferating tissue culture cells are treated with Taxol, they are arrested in mitosis by the spindle assembly checkpoint (London and Biggins, 2014London N. Biggins S. Signalling dynamics in the spindle checkpoint response.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 736-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These cells eventually become committed to one of the two fates; exiting mitosis with failed chromosome segregation (“slippage”), or apoptotic cell death while arrested in mitosis (Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008Gascoigne K.E. Taylor S.S.

Rieder C.L. Cells satisfy the mitotic checkpoint in Taxol, and do so faster in concentrations that stabilize syntelic attachments.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This fate decision is made stochastically, and the probability of these choices differs widely among cell lines (Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008Gascoigne K.E. Taylor S.S. Cancer cells display profound intra- and interline variation following prolonged exposure to antimitotic drugs.Cancer Cell. 2008; 14: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Two competing mechanisms determine the timing of slippage and apoptosis. Slippage timing is affected by checkpoint strength, sustaining cyclin B above threshold levels (Collin et al., 2013Collin P. Nashchekina O. Walker R. Pines J. The spindle assembly checkpoint works like a rheostat rather than a toggle switch.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 1378-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Apoptosis timing is determined by the rate at which “death signals” accumulate until threshold levels (Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008Gascoigne K.E. Taylor S.S. Cancer cells display profound intra- and interline variation following prolonged exposure to antimitotic drugs.Cancer Cell. 2008; 14: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, Topham and Taylor, 2013Topham C.H. Taylor S.S. Mitosis and apoptosis: how is the balance set?.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2013; 25: 780-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Apoptosis during mitotic arrest is executed by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and subsequent caspase activation in a p53 independent manner (Blagosklonny, 2007Blagosklonny M.V. Mitotic arrest and cell fate: why and how mitotic inhibition of transcription drives mutually exclusive events.Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, Topham and Taylor, 2013Topham C.H.

Schandl C. et al.MYC Is a Major Determinant of Mitotic Cell Fate.Cancer Cell. 2015; 28: 129-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Whichever mechanism reaches its threshold earlier manifests itself. However, the mechanisms that define the kinetics of death signal accumulation and threshold are poorly understood. Here, we reveal that nucleosomes have a higher affinity for cGAS than naked DNA, but suppress DNA-dependent stimulation of cGAS activity. Accordingly, chromosomes are refractory to the innate immune system during normal mitotic progression. However, when cells arrest in mitosis, cGAS-dependent IRF3 phosphorylation slowly accumulates and triggers intrinsic apoptosis through releasing Bcl-xL-dependent suppression of MOMP by a transcription-independent mechanism. Mouse xenograft experiments, as well as data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), indicate a role for cGAS in the tumor response to taxane treatment. Although it has been reported that chromatin can interact with cGAS (Mackenzie et al., 2017Mackenzie K.J. Carroll P. Martin C.-A. Murina O. Fluteau A. Simpson D.J. Olova N. Sutcliffe H. Rainger J.K. Leitch A. et al.cGAS surveillance of micronuclei links genome instability to innate immunity.Nature. 2017; 548: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), the functional implication was unclear. We found that cGAS binds nucleosome arrays much better than naked DNA in vitro (Figure 1B), and cGAS bound nucleosomes even in physiological M-phase Xenopus egg extracts (Figure S1A). Quantitative gel-shift analysis using purified components further demonstrated that recombinant cGAS (Figure S1B) has an ∼2-fold higher affinity for mononucleosomes than for naked DNA (Figures 1C and S1C). Mutating DNA binding residues (Civril et al., 2013Civril F. Deimling T. de Oliveira Mann C.C. Ablasser A. Moldt M. Witte G. Hornung V. Hopfner K.-P. Structural mechanism of cytosolic DNA sensing by cGAS.Nature. 2013; 498: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) greatly reduced affinity for naked DNA (KRKK mutant, Figure 1D), but only modestly for nucleosomes (Figure 1E), suggesting that mechanisms of cGAS binding to naked DNA and to nucleosomes are distinct. Indeed, cGAS bound the purified H2A-H2B heterodimer (Figure 1F), but mutating the acidic patch of H2A-H2B, which is frequently targeted by nucleosome binding proteins, to either alanine or lysine and arginine abrogated the interaction (ap∗A and ap∗KR, Figure 1F). In agreement with a recent report (Mackenzie et al., 2017Mackenzie K.J. Carroll P. Martin C.-A. Murina O. Fluteau A. Simpson D.J. Olova N. Sutcliffe H. Rainger J.K. Leitch A. et al.cGAS surveillance of micronuclei links genome instability to innate immunity.Nature. 2017; 548: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), nucleosomes were able to stimulate cGAMP synthesis by cGAS, but when compared to DNA-bound cGAS, nucleosome-bound cGAS showed an ∼3-fold reduction in the apparent catalysis rate (Kcat, Figures 1G, 1H, and S1D). When increasing amounts of nucleosomes were added to a constant amount of naked DNA and cGAS, nucleosomes competitively suppressed the capacity of naked DNA to activate cGAS (Figure 1I). These results suggest that, on chromosomes, nucleosomes could interfere with cGAS activation by nucleosome-free regions. Consistent with the interaction between cGAS and nucleosomes, cGAS is recruited to mitotic chromosomes (Gentili et al., 2019Gentili M. Lahaye X. Nadalin F. Nader G.P.F. Puig Lombardi E. Herve S. De Silva N.S. Rookhuizen D.C. Zueva E.

Live imaging of GFP-tagged cGAS (GFP-cGAS) in HeLa cells showed that cGAS associates with chromosomes immediately after nuclear envelope breakdown (Figures S1E and S1F; Video S1), and this localization was not affected by mutations in the cGAS DNA binding domain (Figure S1G). Immunofluorescence of endogenous cGAS confirmed its localization to mitotic chromosomes in HeLa cells and in telomerase-immortalized human BJ hTERT fibroblasts (Figures S1H–S1J). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/260dd928-45e2-4d5d-87f1-b90ee7f1cb50/mmc4.mp4Loading ...

Images were taken every 15 min. Top: Overlays of H2B-RFP and GFP (left) or GFP-cGAS (right). Bottom: DIC channel images corresponding to the fluorescence images on top. To determine if chromosome-bound cGAS could activate downstream signaling during mitosis, we monitored IRF3 phosphorylation at Ser396, a widely used indicator of cGAS activation (Chen et al., 2016Chen Q. Sun L. Chen Z.J. Regulation and function of the cGAS-STING pathway of cytosolic DNA sensing.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). We initially found little evidence for phosphorylation on the endogenous protein in HeLa cells, where STING function is compromised by papillomavirus E7 protein (Lau et al., 2015Lau L. Gray E.E. Brunette R.L. Stetson D.B. DNA tumor virus oncogenes antagonize the cGAS-STING DNA-sensing pathway.Science. 2015; 350: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), but when detection sensitivity was increased by overexpressing GFP-tagged IRF3, a slow cGAS-dependent increase in phospho-Ser396 was revealed during mitotic arrest induced with Taxol or nocodazole (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A), in a manner dependent on the IRF3 kinase TBK1 (Chen et al., 2016Chen Q. Sun L. Chen Z.J. Regulation and function of the cGAS-STING pathway of cytosolic DNA sensing.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). Mitotic, cGAS-dependent phosphorylation was also observed on endogenous IRF3 at Ser396 after enrichment by immunoprecipitation, as well as Ser386 (Schoggins et al., 2014Schoggins J.W. MacDuff D.A.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia among the elderly (Tanzi, 2012Tanzi R.E. The genetics of Alzheimer disease.Cold Spring Harb.

Genome-wide association studies have identified >30 genetic loci for AD, many related to immune response and microglia (Efthymiou and Goate, 2017Efthymiou A.G. Goate A.M.

While microglia can clear amyloid beta (Aβ), they can also release pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to neuroinflammation (Hansen et al., 2018Hansen D.V. Hanson J.E. Sheng M.

A better understanding of the mechanisms that control microglial activation could advance therapies for AD. CD33 encodes a sialic-acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec-3) expressed on the surface of myeloid progenitor cells, monocytes, and macrophages. CD33 has been implicated in cell adhesion processes, endocytosis, inhibition of cytokine release, immune cell growth (Crocker et al., 2007Crocker P.R. Paulson J.C. Varki A. Siglecs and their roles in the immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar), and regulation of Tlr4 signaling (Ishida et al., 2014Ishida A. Akita K.

Chem. 2014; 289: 25341-25350Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We previously showed that CD33 exhibits increased expression in microglial cells in AD brain and that the protective allele of CD33 SNP rs3865444 was associated with reductions in CD33 expression and insoluble Aβ42 levels in AD brain (Griciuc et al., 2013Griciuc A.

We also showed CD33 inhibited microglial uptake and clearance of Aβ42 and that plaque burden was reduced in APP/PS1;CD33−/− mice. In contrast, the risk allele of rs3865444 was associated with decreased Aβ42 uptake and increased expression of CD33 and TREM2 in monocytes (Bradshaw et al., 2013Bradshaw E.M. Chibnik L.B.

CD33 Alzheimer’s risk-altering polymorphism, CD33 expression, and exon 2 splicing.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 13320-13325Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Exon 2 encodes the sialic acid-binding domain, required for CD33-mediated inhibition of Aβ uptake in microglia (Griciuc et al., 2013Griciuc A. Serrano-Pozo A. Parrado A.R. Lesinski A.N. Asselin C.N.

Higher CD33 expression levels in the brain were associated with greater cognitive decline (Karch et al., 2012Karch C.M. Jeng A.T. Nowotny P. Cady J. Cruchaga C. Goate A.M.

The AD risk factor TREM2 is an immunoreceptor expressed on myeloid cells, primarily microglia, where it regulates inflammatory response (Tanzi, 2015Tanzi R.E.

Conversely, TREM2 overexpression in AD mouse models reduced plaque load and upregulated phagocytosis genes (Lee et al., 2018Lee C.Y.D. Daggett A. Gu X. Jiang L.L. Langfelder P. Li X. Wang N. Zhao Y. Park C.S.

The AD-linked R47H variant of TREM2 impaired microgliosis in the 5xFAD mouse model (Song et al., 2018Song W.M. Joshita S. Zhou Y. Ulland T.K. Gilfillan S. Colonna M. Humanized TREM2 mice reveal microglia-intrinsic and -extrinsic effects of R47H polymorphism.J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215: 745-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the crosstalk between CD33 and TREM2 in AD pathogenesis by generating single and double CD33/TREM2 knockout mice on wild-type (WT) and 5xFAD backgrounds. CD33 knockout decreased Aβ pathology and improved cognition in 5xFAD mice, both of which were abrogated by additional TREM2 knockout. TREM2 knockout reduced clustering of Iba1+ myeloid cells around plaques, which could not be rescued by CD33 knockout. CD33 and/or TREM2 knockout reprogrammed microglial gene expression signatures in 5xFAD mice in an age-dependent manner. Differential gene expression in 5xFAD;CD33−/− microglia depended on the presence of TREM2. These data suggest that TREM2 acts downstream of CD33 and that loss of microglial clearance capacity might be reversed by therapeutic inhibition of CD33 or activation of TREM2. To test whether CD33 and TREM2 impact cognitive function in AD mice, we inactivated CD33 and/or TREM2 function in the 5xFAD mouse (Oakley et al., 2006Oakley H. Cole S.L. Logan S. Maus E. Shao P. Craft J. Guillozet-Bongaarts A. Ohno M. Disterhoft J.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10129-10140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). WT, CD33−/−, TREM2−/−, CD33−/−;TREM2−/−, 5xFAD, 5xFAD;CD33−/−, 5xFAD;TREM2−/−, and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice were tested at 7 months of age for locomotor activity, anxiety levels, and exploratory behavior in the open-field arena. We found no significant differences between the mouse groups for total distance traveled during exploration of the arena (Figure 1A) and total time spent in the center of the arena (Figure 1B). To assess spatial learning and memory in 7-month-old mice, we employed the Morris water maze test (Vorhees and Williams, 2006Vorhees C.V. Williams M.T. Morris water maze: procedures for assessing spatial and related forms of learning and memory.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 848-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar) on the same mouse cohort. For training trials, a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed significant effects for days (F(6,360) = 71.24, p < 0.0001) and for groups (F(7,60) = 5.781, p < 0.0001), but not for interaction (F(42,360) = 1.407, p = 0.0539, Figure 1C). 5xFAD;CD33−/− mice displayed improved spatial learning versus 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice on days 6 and 7 (Figure 1C, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively, two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s test). Training and test phases of platform locations are shown in Figure S1A. On day 8, memory recall evaluation was conducted using the probe test (removed platform). We found no significant differences in latency to the target quadrant (Figure S1B) or time spent in the target quadrant (Figure S1C). However, based on time spent in the area surrounding the missing platform (platform plus), we found significant differences (Figure 1D, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, p < 0.0001). 5xFAD mice showed impaired retention memory compared to WT (Figure 1D, p < 0.01). Retention memory improved in 5xFAD;CD33−/− mice compared to 5xFAD (p < 0.05), 5xFAD;TREM2−/− (p < 0.05) and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− (p < 0.01) mice (Figure 1D, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, Dunn’s test). Similarly, based on the number of platform plus crossovers, we found significant differences among the mouse groups (Figure 1E, one-way ANOVA, F(7,60) = 9.134, p < 0.0001). 5xFAD mice exhibited impaired retention memory compared to WT (Figure 1E, p < 0.01). Retention memory improved in 5xFAD;CD33−/− mice compared to 5xFAD (p < 0.01), 5xFAD;TREM2−/− (p < 0.01) and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− (p < 0.01) mice (Figure 1E, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s test). For all groups, no differences were observed in swim speed (Figure 1F) or latencies to the visible platform (Figure 1G). In summary, CD33 knockout significantly improved retention memory defects in 5xFAD mice. These effects were abrogated by additional knockout of TREM2, suggesting TREM2 functions downstream of CD33. Next, we explored Aβ in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)-soluble and formic-acid (FA)-soluble fractions of cortex from 8-month-old 5xFAD, 5xFAD;CD33−/−, 5xFAD;TREM2−/−, and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice, by Aβ ELISA. Levels of TBS-soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 were similar in all groups (Figures 2A and 2B ), whereas levels of FA-soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 were markedly increased in 5xFAD;TREM2−/− mice versus 5xFAD (Figures 2C and 2D). In contrast, levels of FA-soluble Aβ42 were decreased in 5xFAD;CD33−/− versus 5xFAD, 5xFAD;TREM2−/− and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice (Figure 2D). Knockout of TREM2 abrogated the reduction in Aβ in 5xFAD;CD33−/− mice. Knockout of TREM2 did not impact levels of Aβ in 5xFAD mice at 6 months of age (Figures S2A–S2D). We next investigated whether CD33 and TREM2 knockout impacts Aβ deposition. Coronal sections from 8-month-old mice were analyzed for amyloid plaque burden in cortex and hippocampus using the 3D6 antibody (Griciuc et al., 2013Griciuc A. Serrano-Pozo A. Parrado A.R. Lesinski A.N. Asselin C.N. Mullin K. Hooli B. Choi S.H. Hyman B.T. Tanzi R.E. Alzheimer’s disease risk gene CD33 inhibits microglial uptake of amyloid beta.Neuron. 2013; 78: 631-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). 3D6 did not label control brains (Figure S2E). In comparison to 5xFAD, Aβ plaque burden was robustly decreased in the cortex and hippocampus of 5xFAD;CD33−/− and markedly increased in 5xFAD;TREM2−/− mice (Figures 2E–2G). 5xFAD;CD33−/− mice displayed dramatically reduced Aβ plaque burden in cortex and hippocampus compared to both 5xFAD;TREM2−/− and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice (Figures 2E–2G). 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice exhibited significantly increased cortical Aβ plaque load relative to 5xFAD (Figure 2F), similar to that observed in 5xFAD;TREM2−/− mice. TREM2 knockout did not modulate Aβ plaque burden in younger (6-month-old) 5xFAD mice (Figures S2F–S2H), indicating that TREM2 knockout increases amyloid plaque load at later stages of disease progression (e.g., 8 months of age). In summary, knockout of TREM2 abrogated the reduction in Aβ pathology observed in 5xFAD;CD33−/− mice, suggesting TREM2 functions downstream of CD33. Next, we investigated the impact of CD33 and TREM2 knockout on neuronal counts in 8-month-old 5xFAD hippocampal CA1. WT, CD33−/−, TREM2−/−, and CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice displayed no differences in the number of NeuN+ (mature) neurons in CA1 (Figures 3A and 3B ). There was also no significant difference in neuronal cell numbers among WT, 5xFAD, and 5xFAD;CD33−/− mice. The numbers of NeuN+ cells were significantly reduced in both 5xFAD;TREM2−/− and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice compared to 5xFAD (Figures 3A and 3B). These three lines showed no differences in spatial learning and retention memory (Morris water maze; Figures 1C–1E). This may be due to fast kinetics of Aβ deposition in 5xFAD mice leading to a ceiling effect on cognitive deficits by 7 months of age. 5xFAD;CD33−/− mice exhibited increased number of NeuN+ cells compared to 5xFAD;TREM2−/− and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice (Figure 3B). These results were confirmed using H&E staining (Figures S3A and S3B). Collectively, our results show that knockout of TREM2 reduced CA1 pyramidal cell density in 5xFAD mice and could not be rescued by additional knockout of CD33. 8-month-old mice WT, CD33−/−, TREM2−/−, and CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice exhibited no differences in the number of NeuN+ neurons in cortical layer 5 (Figures S3C and S3D). Numbers of cortical layer 5 NeuN+ cells were significantly reduced in 5xFAD compared to WT mice. However, there were no significant differences among 5xFAD, 5xFAD;TREM2−/−, and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice. Numbers of cortical layer 5 NeuN+ cells were significantly increased in 5xFAD;CD33−/− mice compared to 5xFAD, 5xFAD;TREM2−/− and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice (Figures S3C and S3D). Thus, CD33 knockout increased pyramidal cell density in cortical layer 5 in 5xFAD mice, and this was abrogated by additional knockout of TREM2. To investigate the effects of CD33 and TREM2 knockout on neurodegeneration in 8-month-old 5xFAD mice, we stained brain sections with an antibody specific for activated caspase-3 and assessed cell loss. WT, CD33−/−, TREM2−/−, and CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice showed very few caspase-3+ cells in cortex and hippocampus (Figures 3D and 3E). Conversely, 5xFAD mice exhibited increased numbers of caspase-3+ cells compared to WT. The numbers of caspase-3+ cells were increased in cortex and hippocampus of both 5xFAD;TREM2−/− and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice versus 5xFAD (Figures 3C–3E). In contrast, 5xFAD;CD33−/− mice showed reduced numbers of caspase-3+ cells in cortex and hippocampus versus 5xFAD, 5xFAD;TREM2−/− and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice (Figures 3C–3E). Thus, CD33 and TREM2 have opposite effects on neurodegeneration in 5xFAD mice. In conclusion, the attenuation in neurodegeneration observed in 5xFAD;CD33−/− versus 5xFAD mice was abrogated by additional knockout of TREM2. Next, we investigated whether CD33 and/or TREM2 knockout impact the response of Iba1+ myeloid cells to Aβ deposition in 8-month-old 5xFAD mice. Iba1+ cells were evident around plaques (Figure 4A). Numbers of Iba1+ cells were increased in 5xFAD mice versus WT and comparable in cortex and hippocampus of WT, CD33−/−, TREM2−/−, and CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice (Figures 4B, 4C, and S4A). 5xFAD;TREM2−/− and 5xFAD;TREM2−/−;CD33−/− mice displayed reduced numbers of Iba1+ cells in cortex and hippocampus versus 5xFAD (Figures 4A–4C). We next quantified the number of Iba1+ cells around plaques of similar sizes (Figures S4B and S4C). The degree of Iba1+ cell clustering around plaques was significantly decreased in cortex and hippocampus of both 5xFAD;TREM2−/− and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice versus 5xFAD (Figures 4D and 4E). Iba1+ cell clustering around hippocampal plaques was also decreased in 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice versus 5xFAD;TREM2−/− (Figure 4E), suggesting that CD33 and TREM2 might synergize in controlling the number of Iba1+ cells around Aβ deposits. In 5xFAD;CD33−/− mice, numbers of Iba1+ cells (Figures 4B and 4C) and clustering of Iba1+ cells around plaques (Figures 4D and 4E) were unchanged versus 5xFAD but increased versus 5xFAD;TREM2−/− and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice (Figures 4A–4E). Thus, additional knockout of CD33 did not rescue the reduction in numbers of Iba1+ cells or clustering of Iba1+ cells around plaques in 5xFAD;TREM2−/− mice. No differences were noted in Iba1+ cell body area among controls, WT, CD33−/−, TREM2−/−, and CD33−/−;TREM2−/− (Figures S4D and S4E). Reduced Iba1+ cell body area (Figures S4F and S4G) and increased distance between Iba1+ cells and associated plaques (Figures 4F and 4G) were observed in cortex and hippocampus of 5xFAD;TREM2−/− and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice versus 5xFAD. 5xFAD;CD33−/− mice exhibited significantly shorter distance between Iba1+ cells and adjacent plaques (Figures 4F and 4G) and increased Iba1+ cell body area (Figures S4F and S4G) in cortex and hippocampus versus 5xFAD;TREM2−/− and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice but not versus 5xFAD. Thus, TREM2 knockout in 5xFAD mice leads to increased distance between Iba1+ cells and plaques as well as reduced Iba1+ cell body area; additional knockout of CD33 did not rescue these effects. Based on Iba1 labeling of both microglia and monocytes infiltrating into the brain, we evaluated the extent of overlap between Iba1+ and P2ry12+ cells. P2ry12 is selectively expressed in microglia (Hickman et al., 2013Hickman S.E. Kingery N.D. Ohsumi T.K. Borowsky M.L. Wang L.C. Means T.K. El Khoury J. The microglial sensome revealed by direct RNA sequencing.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1896-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Numbers of P2ry12+Iba1+ cells were comparable in cortex (Figures 4H and 4I) and hippocampus (Figures S4H and 4J) of 8-month-old 5xFAD, 5xFAD;CD33−/−, 5xFAD;TREM2−/−, and 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice. However, numbers of P2ry12+Iba1+ cells normalized to Iba1+ cells were significantly increased in cortex and hippocampus of 5xFAD;TREM2−/− mice versus 5xFAD and 5xFAD;CD33−/− mice (Figures 4K and 4L). The percentage of P2ry12+Iba1+/Iba1+ cells was increased in cortex (Figure 4K) but not hippocampus (Figure 4L) of 5xFAD;CD33−/−;TREM2−/− mice versus 5xFAD and 5xFAD;CD33−/− mice. Thus, TREM2 knockout leads to an increase in P2ry12+Iba1+/Iba1+ cells in 5xFAD mice, suggesting they are resident microglia. The reduction in Iba1+ cells around plaques in 5xFAD mice deficient for TREM2 may be due to a lower number of macrophages derived from infiltrating monocytes. We next examined whether knockout of CD33 affected the number of TREM2+ cells surrounding Congo red+ plaques in 5xFAD mice. Numbers of TREM2+ cells around Aβ plaques were markedly increased in cortex (Figures S4I and S4J) but not hippocampus (Figure S4K) of 5xFAD;CD33−/− mice in comparison to 5xFAD. Thus, CD33 knockout leads to increased numbers of TREM2+ cells surrounding Aβ plaques in the cortex of 5xFAD mice. We next analyzed microglial transcriptomes in forebrains from 4- and 8-month-old WT and 5xFAD mice using microglia that were isolated as previously described (Hickman et al., 2013Hickman S.E. Kingery N.D. Ohsumi T.K. Borowsky M.L. Wang L.C. Means T.K. El Khoury J. The microglial sensome revealed by direct RNA sequencing.Nat.

Here we establish a versatile protocol for generating vascularized three-dimensional (3D) kidney organoids. We employ dynamic modulation of WNT signaling to control the relative proportion of proximal versus distal nephron segments, producing a correlative level of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) to define a resident vascular network. Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies a subset of nephron progenitor cells as a potential source of renal vasculature. These kidney organoids undergo further structural and functional maturation upon implantation. Using this kidney organoid platform, we establish an in vitro model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), the cystic phenotype of which can be effectively prevented by gene correction or drug treatment.

Hematopoietic aging is characterized by expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with impaired function, such as reduced engraftment, quiescence, self-renewal, unfolded protein response, and lymphoid differentiation potential, leading to myeloid-biased output both in mice (Liang et al., 2005Liang Y.

Myeloid malignancies are more frequent in the elderly, but whether changes in the aged HSCs and/or their microenvironment predispose to these malignancies remains unclear.

However, aging also reduces HSC polarity and capacity to lodge near bone (Köhler et al., 2009Köhler A. Schmithorst V. Filippi M.D. Ryan M.A. Daria D. Gunzer M. Geiger H.

For instance, myeloid bias can result from telomere dysfunction (Ju et al., 2007Ju Z. Jiang H. Jaworski M. Rathinam C. Gompf A. Klein C. Trumpp A. Rudolph K.L. Telomere dysfunction induces environmental alterations limiting hematopoietic stem cell function and engraftment.Nat.

However, both platelet-primed and unprimed old HSCs exhibit myeloid bias (Grover et al., 2016Grover A. Sanjuan-Pla A. Thongjuea S. Carrelha J. Giustacchini A. Gambardella A. Macaulay I. Mancini E. Luis T.C. Mead A. et al.Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals molecular and functional platelet bias of aged haematopoietic stem cells.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11075Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), possibly suggesting a microenvironmental participation. The standard model of platelet generation (thrombopoiesis) suggests that megakaryocyte precursors migrate from endosteal BM (close to bone) to sinusoids (further from bone) for maturation (Eto and Kunishima, 2016Eto K. Kunishima S. Linkage between the mechanisms of thrombocytopenia and thrombopoiesis.Blood. 2016; 127: 1234-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which can be promoted by cytokines like interleukin (IL)-1α IL-1β, IL-6, IL-3, and interferon-gamma (IFNγ) (Pietras, 2017Pietras E.M. Inflammation: a key regulator of hematopoietic stem cell fate in health and disease.Blood. 2017; 130: 1693-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Whereas platelet-biased HSCs are located near sinusoids (Pinho et al., 2018Pinho S. Marchand T. Yang E. Wei Q. Nerlov C. Frenette P.S. Lineage-Biased Hematopoietic Stem Cells Are Regulated by Distinct Niches.Dev. Cell. 2018; 44: 634-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), both megakaryocytes and their precursors have been recently found throughout BM, including the sinusoids where megakaryocyte maturation and thrombopoiesis take place (Plo et al., 2017Plo I. Bellanné-Chantelot C. Mosca M. Mazzi S. Marty C. Vainchenker W. Genetic Alterations of the Thrombopoietin/MPL/JAK2 Axis Impacting Megakaryopoiesis.Front. Endocrinol.

In this study, we have investigated whether different BM microenvironments regulate myeloid differentiation and megakaryopoiesis during aging. To characterize changes in vascular beds during aging, we performed whole-mount immunofluorescence staining of thick femoral sections of young and old wild type (WT) mice using CD31 and endomucin (EMCN) to identify sinusoids, arterioles, capillaries, and transition zone vessels (TZVs), which connect arterioles with sinusoids near bone (endosteum). Consistent with previous findings (Kusumbe et al., 2016Kusumbe A.P. Ramasamy S.K. Itkin T. Mäe M.A. Langen U.H. Betsholtz C. Lapidot T. Adams R.H. Age-dependent modulation of vascular niches for haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2016; 532: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), endosteal vessels and TZVs were reduced in old mice; however, we also noted that, whereas sinusoidal areas appeared unchanged, arterioles were slightly reduced and capillaries located further from bone increased 4-fold in old mice (Figures 1A–1F). These vascular changes were paralleled by similar alterations of their associated perivascular cells. We used Nes-gfp transgenic mice, which carry HSC niche-forming perivascular BM mesenchymal stem or progenitor cells (BMSCs) labeled with GFP (Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2010bMéndez-Ferrer S. Michurina T.V. Ferraro F. Mazloom A.R. Macarthur B.D. Lira S.A. Scadden D.T. Ma’ayan A. Enikolopov G.N. Frenette P.S. Mesenchymal and haematopoietic stem cells form a unique bone marrow niche.Nature. 2010; 466: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar). Nes-GFP+ cells augmented 4-fold specifically in non-endosteal BM, mostly associated with the increased capillaries (Figures 1G–1I and S1A–S1D). These changes correlated with increased inflammatory cytokines that drive myeloid cell expansion (Pietras, 2017Pietras E.M.

The concentration of IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6 increased in the BM during aging, whereas IL-3 and IFNγ showed similar trends (Figures 1J–1N and S1M-S1Q). We have previously shown that sympathetic adrenergic signals regulate Nes-GFP+ cell proliferation (Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2010bMéndez-Ferrer S. Michurina T.V. Ferraro F. Mazloom A.R. Macarthur B.D.

However, the opposite (decreased BM adrenergic innervation) has been recently suggested as causative of HSC aging (Maryanovich et al., 2018Maryanovich M. Zahalka A.H. Pierce H. Pinho S. Nakahara F. Asada N. Wei Q. Wang X. Ciero P. Xu J. et al.Adrenergic nerve degeneration in bone marrow drives aging of the hematopoietic stem cell niche.Nat. Med. 2018; 24: 782-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To clarify this, whole-mount preparations of skulls and thick tibial sections of Nes-gfp mice were immunostained for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), to visualize sympathetic noradrenergic fibers and nestin+ cells in large 3D volumes. This study did not confirm reduced TH+ fibers in the aged BM (Maryanovich et al., 2018Maryanovich M. Zahalka A.H. Pierce H. Pinho S. Nakahara F. Asada N. Wei Q. Wang X. Ciero P. Xu J. et al.Adrenergic nerve degeneration in bone marrow drives aging of the hematopoietic stem cell niche.Nat. Med. 2018; 24: 782-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) but found these fibers increased by 50% in the skull of old mice (Figures 2A–2C) and augmented 2.5-fold in the aged tibial BM, compared with the young samples (Figures 2D–2F). In both cases, nestin+ cells were found in proximity of noradrenergic fibers (Figures S1E–S1L). Together, these results suggest contraction of endosteal (bone-associated) HSC niches and expansion of non-endosteal neurovascular HSC niches during aging. To study the possible contribution of increased adrenergic innervation to aged hematopoiesis, we analyzed mice lacking β2-ΑR and β3-ΑR (Adrb2−/−Adrb3−/−), the main β-ARs that cooperate in HSC niche regulation (Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2010aMéndez-Ferrer S. Battista M. Frenette P.S. Cooperation of beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenergic receptors in hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2010; 1192: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Importantly, myeloid and megakaryocyte progenitors expanded less in the endosteal BM of aged Adrb2−/−Adrb3−/− mice (Figures 3A, 3B, and S2A–S2F). Consequently, megakaryocytes did not increase in Adrb2−/−Adrb3−/− mice during aging (Figures 3C–3G), suggesting a functional role for increased noradrenergic signaling in aged hematopoiesis. Megakaryocytes were less frequently found in apposition to BM sinusoids and could form less protrusions (required for proplatelet formation) in aged Adrb2−/−Adrb3−/− mice (Figures 3H–3M). Accordingly, aged Adrb2−/−Adrb3−/− mice did not show the increased circulating platelets typically observed in aged WT mice (Figure 3N), whereas other circulating blood cell types remained unaffected (Figures S2G–S2J). These results suggest that increased β-adrenergic signaling in the BM promotes myeloid differentiation into platelets during aging. We analyzed single Adrb2−/− mice and Adrb3−/− mice to understand the role of each β-AR in myelopoietic regulation. Resembling aged Adrb2−/−Adrb3−/− mice (Figure 3N), aged Adrb2−/− mice did not exhibit increased circulating platelets (Figure 4A), suggesting that increased β2-adrenergic activity promotes thrombopoiesis during aging. Already at adulthood, Adrb2−/− mice showed reduced frequency of myeloid and megakaryocyte progenitors, and this reduction persisted during aging (Figures 4B, 4C, S3A, and S3B). We generated BM chimeras using Adrb2−/− mice or WT mice as donors/recipients to distinguish hematopoietic cell-autonomous from microenvironmental regulation. WT mice carrying β2-AR-deficient hematopoietic cells showed normal frequencies of myeloid and megakaryocyte progenitors (Figures 4B′–4C′ and S3A′–S3B′). In contrast, Adrb2−/− recipients of WT BM cells showed similar reductions as found in primary mice (Figures 4B″–4C″ and S3A″–S3B″). These results suggest that β2-AR signals promote megakaryocyte differentiation through the microenvironment. To obtain mechanistic insight, we treated with selective β2-AR or β3-AR agonists the HSPC-like HPC-7 cell line (Pinto do O et al., 1998Pinto do O P. Kolterud A. Carlsson L. Expression of the LIM-homeobox gene LH2 generates immortalized steel factor-dependent multipotent hematopoietic precursors.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5744-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) cultured alone or co-cultured with MS-5 stromal cells, which resemble nestin+ BMSCs (Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2008Méndez-Ferrer S. Lucas D. Battista M. Frenette P.S. Haematopoietic stem cell release is regulated by circadian oscillations.Nature. 2008; 452: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2010bMéndez-Ferrer S. Michurina T.V. Ferraro F. Mazloom A.R. Macarthur B.D. Lira S.A. Scadden D.T. Ma’ayan A. Enikolopov G.N. Frenette P.S. Mesenchymal and haematopoietic stem cells form a unique bone marrow niche.Nature. 2010; 466: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (2468) Google Scholar; Figures S3C and S3D). Whereas the selective β-AR agonists did not affect megakaryocyte differentiation of HPC-7 cells cultured alone (Figure S3E), β2-AR and β3-AR agonists had opposite stage-specific effects on megakaryocytic differentiation from HPC-7 cells co-cultured with MS-5 cells. Whereas β3-AR agonist increased the frequency of undifferentiated c-kithiCD41lo cells and decreased the fraction of c-kitloCD41lo megakaryocyte progenitors, β2-AR agonist did not affect early differentiation, but instead increased the frequency of CD41hi megakaryocytic cells at a later differentiation stage (Figure S3F). To test the potential significance of this regulation in the human setting, we treated human umbilical cord blood-derived hCD34+ HSPCs co-cultured with MS-5 cells with a selective β2-AR agonist (Figure 4D). Treatment with β2-AR agonist increased the frequency of human CD61+ megakaryocytic cells (Figures 4E–4G). These results suggest that β2-AR stimulation of stromal cells promotes megakaryocyte differentiation. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we measured several cytokines which regulate megakaryopoiesis. Among those, IL-6 concentration increased in WT BM during aging (Figure 1H) and was low in endosteal Adrb2−/− BM (Figures 4H and S3G–S3I). Moreover, β2-AR agonist increased Il6 mRNA 2-fold in MS-5 stromal cells; this effect was abrogated after blocking protein kinase A (Figure 4I) downstream of β2-AR signaling (Rosenbaum et al., 2009Rosenbaum D.M. Rasmussen S.G. Kobilka B.K. The structure and function of G-protein-coupled receptors.Nature. 2009; 459: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Adult Adrb2−/− mice and Il6−/− mice showed similarly reduced BM megakaryocytes (Figures 4J–4M), confirming the role of β2-AR and IL6 in megakaryopoiesis. To directly test the role of IL-6 downstream of β2-AR, we established primary BM cultures from Il6−/− or control mice and treated them with β2-AR agonist or vehicle. β2-AR agonist tripled myeloid progenitors in WT samples, but not in Il6−/− samples (Figure 4N). Altogether, these results suggest that β2-AR on stromal cells promotes megakaryocyte differentiation through IL-6. Our co-culture experiments suggested that, contrasting β2-AR, β3-AR might inhibit megakaryocytic differentiation (Figures S3C–S3F). Additionally, β3-AR stimulation has been shown to promote HSC lymphoid skewing (Maryanovich et al., 2018Maryanovich M. Zahalka A.H. Pierce H. Pinho S. Nakahara F. Asada N. Wei Q. Wang X. Ciero P. Xu J. et al.Adrenergic nerve degeneration in bone marrow drives aging of the hematopoietic stem cell niche.Nat. Med. 2018; 24: 782-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the frequency of immunophenotypically defined lymphoid-biased HSCs (Figure S4A; Yamamoto et al., 2013Yamamoto R. Morita Y. Ooehara J. Hamanaka S. Onodera M. Rudolph K.L. Ema H. Nakauchi H. Clonal analysis unveils self-renewing lineage-restricted progenitors generated directly from hematopoietic stem cells.Cell. 2013; 154: 1112-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Lymphoid-biased HSCs were reduced by one-third in adult endosteal Adrb3−/− BM (Figures 5A and S4B). This phenotype was not observed in WT mice carrying β3-AR-deficient hematopoietic cells (Figures 5A′ and S4B′) but was reproduced in chimeric mice lacking β3-AR in the microenvironment (Figures 5A″ and S4B″), implying niche-mediated regulation. Opposite trends were observed for long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) and myeloid-biased HSCs, with their frequencies tending to increase in endosteal Adrb3−/− BM (Figures S4C–S4F). These results suggest accelerated lymphoid deficiency in the endosteal microenvironment lacking β3-AR. We investigated possible mechanisms that might explain the intriguingly opposite effects of β3-AR and β2-AR signaling on lympho-myeloid lineage skewing. Whereas both β-ARs can activate G proteins (Rosenbaum et al., 2009Rosenbaum D.M. Rasmussen S.G. Kobilka B.K. The structure and function of G-protein-coupled receptors.Nature. 2009; 459: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar), their differential cardiovascular effects have been attributed to β3-AR-dependent nitric oxide (NO) generation (Gauthier et al., 1998Gauthier C. Leblais V. Kobzik L. Trochu J.N. Khandoudi N. Bril A. Balligand J.L. Le Marec H. The negative inotropic effect of beta3-adrenoceptor stimulation is mediated by activation of a nitric oxide synthase pathway in human ventricle.J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1377-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured nitrate concentration in the BM extracellular fluid and found it doubled in endosteal (compared with non-endosteal) WT BM and halved in Adrb3−/− BM (Figure 5B). Among NO synthases, Nos1 (but not Nos2 or Nos3) showed higher mRNA expression in endosteal WT BM and was downregulated in Adrb3−/− BM (Figures S4G–S4I). To further study the role of β3-AR and Nos1 on HSC lineage bias, we established primary BM cultures from transgenic mice expressing GFP under the regulatory elements of Von Willebrand factor (Vwf-eGFP), which discriminate myeloid/platelet-biased (Vwf-eGFP+) HSCs from lymphoid-biased (Vwf-eGFP−) HSCs (Sanjuan-Pla et al., 2013Sanjuan-Pla A. Macaulay I.C. Jensen C.T. Woll P.S. Luis T.C. Mead A. Moore S. Carella C. Matsuoka S. Bouriez Jones T. et al.Platelet-biased stem cells reside at the apex of the haematopoietic stem-cell hierarchy.Nature. 2013; 502: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Treatment with β3-AR agonist did not affect platelet-biased HSCs (Figures S4J and S4K) but doubled lymphoid-biased HSCs in a Nos1-dependent manner (Figure 5C). Moreover, Adrb3−/− mice and Nos1−/− mice showed similar signs of premature hematopoietic aging; myeloid or megakaryocyte progenitors (Figures 5D–5G) and megakaryocyte apposition to blood vessels (Figures 5H–5K) similarly increased in adult Adrb3−/− mice and Nos1−/− mice. Consistently, transition zone vessels decreased (Figures 5L–5O) whereas capillaries expanded (Figure 5P) in both KO models. Despite the partial reduction of lymphoid-biased HSCs in endosteal Adrb3−/− BM, the frequencies of circulating lymphocytes or myeloid cells appeared unchanged in 5-month-old Adrb3−/− mice (Figures S4L–S4N), contrasting previous findings (Maryanovich et al., 2018Maryanovich M. Zahalka A.H. Pierce H. Pinho S. Nakahara F. Asada N. Wei Q. Wang X. Ciero P. Xu J. et al.Adrenergic nerve degeneration in bone marrow drives aging of the hematopoietic stem cell niche.Nat. Med. 2018; 24: 782-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Whereas adult Adrb3−/− mice did not yet show in our analysis premature hematopoietic aging in peripheral blood, adult Nos1−/− mice showed reduced lymphocytes and increased neutrophils and platelets in circulation (Figures 6A and 6B ), suggesting that other pathways (besides β3-AR) contribute to Nos1-dependent regulation of hematopoiesis. Altogether, these results suggest that microenvironmental β3-AR contributes to balance HSC lineage-bias toward lymphoid production, which is at least partially dependent on Nos1-dependent NO production. We next interrogated whether the BM microenvironment might promote pathological (and not only physiological) hematopoietic aging. Premature aging in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is caused by the accumulation of a truncated prelamin A protein named “progerin,” which is produced via aberrant splicing resulting from a de novo synonymous c.1824C > T (p.G608G) point mutation in the LMNA gene (encoding lamin A and C) (De Sandre-Giovannoli et al., 2003De Sandre-Giovannoli A.

https://openalex.org/W2961523841,"Elevated levels of type I interferon (IFN) during pregnancy are associated with intrauterine growth retardation, preterm birth, and fetal demise through mechanisms that are not well understood. A critical step of placental development is the fusion of trophoblast cells into a multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (ST) layer. Fusion is mediated by syncytins, proteins deriving from ancestral endogenous retroviral envelopes. Using cultures of human trophoblasts or mouse cells, we show that IFN-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs), a family of restriction factors blocking the entry step of many viruses, impair ST formation and inhibit syncytin-mediated fusion. Moreover, the IFN inducer polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid promotes fetal resorption and placental abnormalities in wild-type but not in Ifitm-deleted mice. Thus, excessive levels of IFITMs may mediate the pregnancy complications observed during congenital infections and other IFN-induced pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2961711147,"Root system architecture (RSA), the distribution of roots in soil, plays a major role in plant survival. RSA is shaped by multiple developmental processes that are largely governed by the phytohormone auxin, suggesting that auxin regulates responses of roots that are important for local adaptation. However, auxin has a central role in numerous processes, and it is unclear which molecular mechanisms contribute to the variation in RSA for environmental adaptation. Using natural variation in Arabidopsis, we identify EXOCYST70A3 as a modulator of the auxin system that causes variation in RSA by acting on PIN4 protein distribution. Allelic variation and genetic perturbation of EXOCYST70A3 lead to alteration of root gravitropic responses, resulting in a different RSA depth profile and drought resistance. Overall our findings suggest that the local modulation of the pleiotropic auxin pathway can gives rise to distinct RSAs that can be adaptive in specific environments."

However, recent work has questioned whether decision-correlated PPC activity plays a causal role in such decisions. That study focused on PPC's contribution to motor aspects of decisions (deciding where to move), but not sensory evaluation aspects (deciding what you are looking at). We employed reversible inactivation to compare PPC's contributions to motor and sensory aspects of decisions. Inactivation affected both aspects of behavior, but preferentially impaired decisions when visual stimuli, rather than motor response targets, were in the inactivated visual field. This demonstrates a causal role for PPC in decision-making, with preferential involvement in evaluating attended task-relevant sensory stimuli compared with motor planning."

In multicellular cyanobacteria, septal junctions enable molecular exchange between sister cells and are required for cellular differentiation. The structure of septal junctions is poorly understood, and it is unknown whether they are capable of controlling intercellular communication. Here, we resolved the in situ architecture of septal junctions by electron cryotomography of cryo-focused ion beam-milled cyanobacterial filaments. Septal junctions consisted of a tube traversing the septal peptidoglycan. Each tube end comprised a FraD-containing plug, which was covered by a cytoplasmic cap. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching showed that intercellular communication was blocked upon stress. Gating was accompanied by a reversible conformational change of the septal junction cap. We provide the mechanistic framework for a cell junction that predates eukaryotic gap junctions by a billion years. The conservation of a gated dynamic mechanism across different domains of life emphasizes the importance of controlling molecular exchange in multicellular organisms."

However, the function of IncRNAs in bladder cancer still remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified an IncRNA, gastric cancer–associated IncRNA1 (GClnc1), which was in high abundance in bladder cancer tissues and its expression was related to poor survival rates in patients with bladder cancer. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that GClnc1 significantly promoted cell proliferation, metastasis, and invasiveness in bladder cancer. Mechanistically, we first found that GClnc1 bound to LIN28B and promoted the expression of myelocytomatosis proto-oncogene (MYC) through the LIN28B/let-7a/MYC pathway. In short, GClnc1 is clinically, functionally, and mechanistically oncogenic in bladder cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2958664531,"Brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) are a chemoresistant population that can drive tumor growth and relapse, but the lack of BTSC-specific markers prevents selective targeting that spares resident stem cells. Through a ribosome-profiling analysis of mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) and BTSCs, we find glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPD1) expression specifically in BTSCs and not in NSCs. GPD1 expression is present in the dormant BTSC population, which is enriched at tumor borders and drives tumor relapse after chemotherapy. GPD1 inhibition prolongs survival in mouse models of glioblastoma in part through altering cellular metabolism and protein translation, compromising BTSC maintenance. Metabolomic and lipidomic analyses confirm that GPD1+ BTSCs have a profile distinct from that of NSCs, which is dependent on GPD1 expression. Similar GPD1 expression patterns and prognostic associations are observed in human gliomas. This study provides an attractive therapeutic target for treating brain tumors and new insights into mechanisms regulating BTSC dormancy."
https://openalex.org/W2962249090,"Renal fibrosis is the common pathway of chronic kidney disease progression. The nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor [FXR, NR1H4 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group member 4)], a multifunctional transcription factor, plays a pivotal role in protecting against fibrosis. However, the mechanisms underlying these antifibrotic actions of FXR in kidney disease are largely unknown. Here, we show that agonist GW4064-mediated FXR activation inhibits the activity of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src (proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase), which is critical for regulation of yes-associated protein (YAP) phosphorylation and nuclear localization in renal fibrosis. Activation of FXR suppressed renal fibrosis and Tyr416-Src phosphorylation in TGF-β–treated human renal proximal tubule epithelial (HK2) cells. Moreover, GW4064 treatment in HK2 cells increased Ser127 phosphorylation, cytosolic accumulation of YAP, and interaction of the hippo core kinases (Ste20-like kinase 1, large tumor suppressor kinase 1, and Salvador homolog 1). Inhibition of Src using PP2 (Src kinase inhibitor) prevented renal fibrosis and increased Ser127 phosphorylation and cytosolic accumulation of YAP. The expression of fibrosis markers, inflammatory genes, and YAP target genes was increased in the kidneys of FXR knockout mice compared with those of wild-type mice. In addition, GW4064 or WAY-362450 (turofexorate isopropyl) treatment protected against unilateral ureteral obstruction–induced renal fibrosis. Collectively, our data support the novel conclusion that Src-mediated crosstalk between FXR and YAP protects against renal fibrosis, making this pathway a possible therapeutic target for chronic kidney disease.—Kim, D.-H., Choi, H.-I., Park, J.

https://openalex.org/W2960751431,"Background Detection of pulmonary nodules is an important aspect of an automatic detection system. Incomputer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, the ability to detect pulmonary nodules is highly important, which plays an important role in the diagnosis and early treatment of lung cancer. Currently, the detection of pulmonary nodules depends mainly on doctor experience, which varies. This paper aims to address the challenge of pulmonary nodule detection more effectively. Methods A method for detecting pulmonary nodules based on an improved neural network is presented in this paper. Nodules are clusters of tissue with a diameter of 3 mm to 30 mm in the pulmonary parenchyma. Because pulmonary nodules are similar to other lung structures and have a low density, false positive nodules often occur. Thus, our team proposed an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) framework to detect nodules. First, a nonsharpening mask is used to enhance the nodules in computed tomography (CT) images; then, CT images of 512×512 pixels are segmented into smaller images of 96×96 pixels. Second, in the 96×96 pixel images which contain or exclude pulmonary nodules, the plaques corresponding to positive and negative samples are segmented. Third, CT images segmented into 96×96 pixels are down-sampled to 64×64 and 32×32 size respectively. Fourth, an improved fusion neural network structure is constructed that consists of three three-dimensional convolutional neural networks, designated as CNN-1, CNN-2, and CNN-3, to detect false positive pulmonary nodules. The networks’ input sizes are 32×32×32, 64×64×64, and 96×96×96 and include 5, 7, and 9 layers, respectively. Finally, we use the AdaBoost classifier to fuse the results of CNN-1, CNN-2, and CNN-3. We call this new neural network framework the Amalgamated-Convolutional Neural Network (A-CNN) and use it to detect pulmonary nodules. Findings Our team trained A-CNN using the LUNA16 and Ali Tianchi datasets and evaluated its performance using the LUNA16 dataset. We discarded nodules less than 5mm in diameter. When the average number of false positives per scan was 0.125 and 0.25, the sensitivity of A-CNN reached as high as 81.7% and 85.1%, respectively."

Although PPIs are generally considered safe, about 13% of the users develop hypomagnesemia. Despite rising attention for this issue, the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Here, we examine whether the gut microbiome is involved in the development of PPI-induced hypomagnesemia in wild-type C57BL/6J mice. After 4 wk of treatment under normal or low dietary Mg2+ availability, omeprazole significantly reduced serum Mg2+ levels only in mice on a low-Mg2+ diet without affecting the mRNA expression of colonic or renal Mg2+ transporters. Overall, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a lower gut microbial diversity in omeprazole-treated mice. Omeprazole induced a shift in microbial composition, which was associated with a 3- and 2-fold increase in the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, respectively. To examine the metabolic consequences of these microbial alterations, the colonic composition of organic acids was evaluated. Low dietary Mg2+ intake, independent of omeprazole treatment, resulted in a 10-fold increase in formate levels. Together, these results imply that both omeprazole treatment and low dietary Mg2+ intake disturb the gut internal milieu and may pose a risk for the malabsorption of Mg2+ in the colon.—Gommers, L. M.

Specific COMPASS tasks employed were; serial-3 subtractions (2-min), serial-7 subtractions (2-min), simple reaction time (RT; 50 stimuli), rapid visual information processing [RVIP (5-min)], choice reaction time (CRT; 50 stimuli), and Stroop (60 stimuli); and a visual analogue scale for fatigue (VAS-F) was completed at the same time intervals.There was a significant condition effect for CRT (f = 26.7, p = 0.007). On average CRT was 101 s (95% CI = -47 to -156 s) quicker in WALK compared to SIT. There was a significant time effect for CRT (f = 15.5, p = 0.01). On average CRT was 134 s slower at 5-h compared to baseline (p = 0.006; 95% CI = -64 to -203 s), and 114 s slower at 5-h compared to 2.5-h (p = 0.01; 95% CI = -44 to -183 s). There was a significant interaction effect for RT in the Stroop incongruent task (f = 10.0, p = 0.03). On average RT was 210 s quicker at 2.5-h in WALK compared to SIT (p = 0.01; 95% CI = -76 to -346 s).Breaking up prolonged sitting with moderate-intensity walking offers an ecologically valid intervention to enhance some aspects of cognitive function, whilst not affecting fatigue in sedentary Qatari females. Whilst these findings are promising, the long-term effects of breaking up sitting on cognitive function requires testing before population level recommendations can be made."

The epidemiology of these organisms in the Chongqing municipality of China is not well described. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of TBPs including Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp. and Theileria spp. in cattle in Chongqing municipality. The results showed that 43.48% (150/345) of cattle were infected with at least one TBP, of which single infections were detected in 104 (30.14%), double infections in 34 cattle (9.86%) and triple infections in 12 (3.48%) of the cattle. The overall prevalence of Anaplasma spp., Theileria spp. and B. bigemina were 22.32%, 23.19% and 7.24%, respectively. Among these, the prevalence of A. bovis, A. central, A. phagocytophilum, A. platys, A. marginale, T. sinensisi and T. orientalis were 8.41%, 7.83%, 4.93%, 4.35%, 2.61%, 22.32% and 2.60%, respectively. We could not detect B. bovis, T. annulata, T. luwenshuni or T. uilenbergi in cattle. Cattle ≥1-year-old were more likely to be infected with Theileria spp. [adjusted odd ratio (AOR) = 2.70, 95% CI = 1.12–6.56)] compared with younger cattle, while cattle ≥1-year-old had reduced susceptibility to B. bigemina (AOR = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.03–0.60). Cattle living at higher altitude (≥500 m) were more susceptible to B. bigemina (AOR = 6.97, 95% CI = 2.08–23.35) and Theileria spp. infection (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.06–3.32). The prevalence of Theileria spp. on farms with cats was significantly higher than that without cats (AOR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.12–5.88). Infection with A. bovis and A. central were significantly associated with A. phagocytophilum infection. Furthermore, there were significant associations between A. bovis and A. central infection, T. sinensisi and A. marginale infection, and B. bigemina and T. orientalis infection. This study provides new data on the prevalence of Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp. and Theileria spp. in cattle in Chongqing, and for the first time we reveal a possible relationship between the afore-mentioned pathogens, which will help in formulating appropriate control strategies for these pathogens in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2959103028,"Factors governing the development of liver fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are only partially understood. We recently identified adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1) as a member of a core set of dysregulated fibrosis-specific genes in human NASH. Here we sought to investigate the relationship between AEBP1 and hepatic fibrosis. We confirmed that hepatic AEBP1 expression is elevated in fibrosis compared to lobular inflammation, steatosis, and normal liver, and increases with worsening fibrosis in NASH patients. AEBP1 expression was upregulated 5.8-fold in activated hepatic stellate cells and downregulated during chemical and contact induction of biological quiescence. In LX-2 and HepG2 cells treated with high glucose (25 mM), AEBP1 expression increased over 7-fold compared to normal glucose conditions. In response to treatment with either fructose or palmitate, AEBP1 expression in primary human hepatocytes increased 2.4-fold or 9.6-fold, but was upregulated 55.8-fold in the presence of fructose and palmitate together. AEBP1 knockdown resulted in decreased expression of nine genes previously identified to be part of a predicted AEBP1-associated NASH co-regulatory network and confirmed to be upregulated in fibrotic tissue. We identified binding sites for two miRNAs known to be downregulated in NASH fibrosis, miR-372-3p and miR-373-3p in the AEBP1 3’ untranslated region. Both miRNAs functionally interacted with AEBP1 to regulate its expression. These findings indicate a novel AEBP1-mediated pathway in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis in NASH."
https://openalex.org/W2958328901,"High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women yet effective targeted therapies against this disease are limited. The heterogeneity of HGSOC, including few shared oncogenic drivers and origination from both the fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) and ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), has hampered development of targeted drug therapies. PAX8 is a lineage-specific transcription factor expressed in the FTE that is also ubiquitously expressed in HGSOC where it is an important driver of proliferation, migration, and cell survival. PAX8 is not normally expressed in the OSE, but it is turned on after malignant transformation. In this study, we use proteomic and transcriptomic analysis to examine the role of PAX8 leading to increased migratory capabilities in a human ovarian cancer model, as well as in tumor models derived from the OSE and FTE. We find that PAX8 is a master regulator of migration with unique downstream transcriptional targets that are dependent on the cell’s site of origin. Importantly, we show that targeting PAX8, either through CRISPR genomic alteration or through drug treatment with micelle encapsulated thiostrepton, leads to a reduction in tumor burden. These findings suggest PAX8 is a unifying protein driving metastasis in ovarian tumors that could be developed as an effective drug target to treat HGSOC derived from both the OSE and FTE."
https://openalex.org/W2960930365,"The canonical complement component 5a (C5a) receptor (C5aR) 1 has well-described roles in tumorigenesis but the contribution of the second receptor, C5aR2, is unclear. The present study demonstrates that B16.F0 melanoma cells express mRNA for both C5aR1 and C5aR2 and signal through ERK and p38 MAPKs in response to C5a. Despite this, C5a had no impact on melanoma cell proliferation or migration in vitro. In vivo studies demonstrated that the growth of B16.F0 melanoma tumors was increased in C5aR2–/– mice but reduced in C5aR1–/– mice and wild-type mice treated with a C5aR1 antagonist. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating leukocyte populations showed no significant differences between wild-type and C5aR2–/– mice. Conversely, percentages of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, macrophages, and regulatory T lymphocytes were lower in tumors from C5aR1–/– mice, whereas total (CD3+) T lymphocytes and CD4+ subsets were higher. Analysis of cytokine and chemokine levels also showed plasma IFN-γ was higher and tumor C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 was lower in the absence of C5aR1. The results suggest that C5aR1 signaling supports melanoma growth by promoting infiltration of immunosuppressive leukocyte populations into the tumor microenvironment, whereas C5aR2 has a more restricted but beneficial role in limiting tumor growth. Overall, these data support the potential of C5aR1-inhibitory therapies for melanoma.—Nabizadeh, J. A., Manthey, H. D., Panagides, N., Steyn, F. J., Lee, J. D., Li, X. X., Akhir, F. N.

https://openalex.org/W2961935902,"Astrocyte function is an important contributor to cellular viability during brain hypoxia and ischemia. Levels of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) HIF-1 and HIF-2 are increased in hypoxic conditions and impact the neuroprotective properties of astrocytes. For example, HIF-2 induces levels of erythropoietin (EPO), a neuroprotectant, by astrocytes. In contrast, HIF-1 activity in astrocytes diminishes the viability of neurons in co-cultures during hypoxia. Thus, HIF-1 and HIF-2 may have opposing effects on astrocytes. In this study, we explore the balance of HIF-1 and HIF-2 signaling in astrocytes during chronic (1–7 d) hypoxia while altering the degree of hypoxia and glucose availability. In addition, we investigate the effects of these conditions on neuron apoptosis. During exposure to chronic moderate hypoxia (2% O2) and plentiful glucose (10 mM), HIF-2 and EPO abundance increases from d 1 to 7. Similarly, pretreatment with moderate hypoxia markedly increases the abundance of HIF-2 and EPO when astrocytes are subsequently exposed to severe hypoxia (0.5% O2; 24 h) in 10 mM glucose, which inhibits neuron apoptosis in coculture. Although HIF-1 targets the expression increase during the 7 d in chronic moderate hypoxia (2% O2) and limited glucose (2 mM), further exposure to severe hypoxia (0.5% O2; 24 h) induces a decrease of most HIF-1 targets in astrocytes. Notably, in astrocyte exposure to 2% O2 prior to 0.5% O2, the expression of iNOS, an HIF-1–regulated protein, keeps increasing when glucose is limited, whereas EPO and VEGF abundance is suppressed, inducing increased apoptosis of neurons in coculture under limited glucose (2 mM). Thus, both hypoxic severity and glucose abundance regulate the balance of HIF-1 and HIF-2 activity in astrocytes, leading to diverse effects on neurons. These results could have important implications on the adaptive or pathologic role of astrocytes during chronic hypoxia and ischemia.—Guo, M., Ma, X., Feng, Y., Han, S., Dong, Q., Cui, M., Zhao, Y.

In the present study, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying OGT loss-driven hyperproinsulinemia. We discovered that the down-regulation of CPE protein in islets of βOGTKO mice is independent of sex, blood glucose levels, and CHOP-mediated ER stress status. Mechanistically, the loss of CPE protein was not due to direct O-GlcNAcylation or transcriptional regulation on CPE, but, in part, due to translational suppression downstream of a loss of eIF4G1. Subsequently, we show that eIF4G1 is O-GlcNAc–modified at serine 61 in β-cells where its O-GlcNAcylation status is required for protein stability. Overexpression of eIF4G1 in dispersed islet cells improved CPE levels and fully rescued βOGTKO hyperproinsulinemia at a cellular level. Altogether, these data suggest a novel role for β-cell OGT in regulating the translational expression of CPE and eIF4G1, critical proteins in the insulin processing pathway that mediate an early point of failure in the development of diabetes. Islets from normoglycemic βOGTKO female mice display reduced insulin content, increased proinsulin content, and proinsulin/insulin ratio (Fig. 1, A–C). To study the underlying mechanisms, we measured the protein level of CPE, a critical proinsulin cleavage enzyme, in βOGTKO islets. We observed significant reduction in total CPE protein in βOGTKO islets compared with littermate control-derived islets (Fig. 1D). Because the islet is composed of multiple cells (22Gu G. Dubauskaite J. Melton D.A. Direct evidence for the pancreatic lineage: NGN3+ cells are islet progenitors and are distinct from duct progenitors.Development. 2002; 129 (11973276): 2447-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we assessed CPE protein presence via immunofluorescence staining. By immunofluorescence staining we showed that CPE loss is preferentially in β-cells (Fig. 1E). By Western blotting, we observed about ∼50% of CPE protein reduction in whole islets, this is explained in part by the normal level of CPE in glucagon-expressing α-cells (Fig. 1, D and E). In another model with partial OGT loss (βOGTHET), islets also demonstrated less CPE staining intensity (Fig. S1A) as did βOGTKO islets from mice of varying ages and sex (Fig. 1G). Furthermore, an OGT inhibitor, OSMI-1, decreased levels of both global O-GlcNAcylation, a measure of OGT activity, and CPE protein level in INS-1 cells (Fig. 2, A–C). Islets with complete or partial OGT loss showed no significant changes in CPE mRNA (Fig. 1F and Fig. S1B) nor did INS-1 cells treated with OGT inhibitor in vitro (Fig. 2D), suggesting the defect was occurring after the gene transcription. To test the direct role of CPE in the OGT-loss phenotype, we genetically reconstituted CPE levels by transiently infecting dispersed WT and βOGTKO primary islet cells with either adenoviral GFP or CPE, achieving ∼70–80% infection rate (Fig. S2A). Although CPE overexpression had a minimal effect on WT proinsulin levels (Fig. 2, E and F), it fully rescued βOGTKO proinsulin cell content (Fig. 2E) and dramatically lowered the proinsulin/insulin content ratio (Fig. 2F), suggesting that down-regulation of CPE is a major contributor to hyperproinsulinemic dysfunction in βOGTKO mice.Figure 2Carboxypeptidase E is not regulated at the post-translational level through O-GlcNAc modification in β-cells. Protein O-GlcNAcylation (RL2), CPE protein (relative to vinculin, normalized to control or 0 μm OSMI) (A–C), and CPE gene expression (relative to β-Actin, log2-fold change to 0 μm) (D) in INS-1 cells were treated for 8 h with the OGT inhibitor OSMI-1 (0, 25, 50 μm, n = 4 per group). Islet proinsulin content (E) and proinsulin-to-insulin ratio (F) from WT and βOGTKO dispersed islet cells were infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-CPE (n = 3). MIN6 CPE protein with sWGA precipitation (±glycoprotein elution buffer (N-acetylglucosamine)) (G), and mouse RL2 (pan-OGlcNAc) (H) or CPE (I) immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot against CPE, RL2, or OGT are shown. The blots are representative of three independent experiments. INS1 lysates, followed by CPE immunoprecipitation or purified ovalbumin with enzymatically labeled GlcNAc in the presence or absence of PNGase F, were immunoblotted against streptavidin (STV) against Biotin or CPE (J). Representative blot (K) and densitometry quantification relative to vinculin (as % of 0 h baseline) (L) of INS-1 CPE protein after 0–24 h of treatment with protein synthesis blocker CHX (50 μg/ml) was following a 2-h pre-treatment with OSMI-1 (30 μm) or DMSO control (n = 3).

Earlier studies report that CPE is mainly localized in secretory granules, near but not inside of Golgi apparatus, and pro-CPE in the ER (19Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. Furukawa H. Steiner D.F.

Another proposed model of CPE localization places the protein inside the insulin vesicles/granules with the C-terminal tail, a putative O-GlcNAcylation region based on YinOYang prediction software (25Gupta R.

Biocomput. 2002; 2002 (11928486): 310-322Google Scholar), projecting into the cytoplasm where OGT could theoretically modify it (26Dhanvantari S. Arnaoutova I. Snell C.R. Steinbach P.J. Hammond K.

To assess for the presence of an O-GlcNAc moiety on CPE, we precipitated all O-GlcNAcylated proteins from MIN6 β-cell lysates using agarose beads conjugated to either succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (sWGA) (Fig. 2G) or the O-GlcNAc–specific RL2 antibody (Fig. 2H). Through sWGA precipitation, we found CPE to be post-translationally modified with glycosylation containing N-acetylglucosamine (Fig. 2G). Due to nonspecificity of the sWGA precipitation technique to O-GlcNAcylation by OGT, we performed immunoprecipitation using O-GlcNAc–specific antibody and found CPE to lack O-GlcNAcylation (Fig. 2H). Here, we used OGT, as positive control for this experiment, as OGT has previously shown to O-GlcNAcylate itself (27Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. Dynamic glycosylation of nuclear and cytosolic proteins: cloning and characterization of a unique O-GlcNAc transferase with multiple tetratricopeptide repeats.J. Biol.

Next, we validated the absence of CPE O-GlcNAcylation using the inverse technique, a CPE antibody IP followed by immunoblot against O-GlcNAc (Fig. 2I). Using co-IP, we were also unable to detect any protein–protein interaction between OGT and CPE (Fig. 2I). Additionally, to verify the lack of O-GlcNAcylation on CPE, we utilized the Click-IT O-GlcNAc Enzymatic system to label GlcNAc moiety using the Gal-T1 (Y289L), in the presence or absence of PNGase F in INS1 cell lysates. Purified ovalbumin was used as a positive control for PNGase F treatment. We observed that CPE is indeed GlcNAc modified, but with PNGase F treatment, we failed to detect any band at the expected size of 50 kDa, verifying that CPE is not O-GlcNAcylated by OGT (Fig. 2J). Furthermore, we found that in vitro OGT inhibition of INS1 β-cells with OSMI-1 (30 μm) had no effect on CPE degradation (Fig. 2, K and L). We verified the translational blockade by cycloheximide (CHX) through immunoblotting against c-myc, a protein with a short half-life (Fig. S1F). Together these data suggest that CPE is not post-translationally regulated by OGT. Because CPE was not regulated via transcription or post-translational modification by OGT, we considered the possibility that ER stress, a well-known translational contributor to protein biosynthesis dysfunction (28Bravo R. Parra V. Gatica D. Rodriguez A.E. Torrealba N. Paredes F. Wang Z.V. Zorzano A. Hill J.A. Jaimovich E. Quest A.F. Lavandero S.

We previously observed elevated levels of the ER stress-mediating Chop protein in βOGTKO islets and its partial deletion improved the diabetic phenotype (i.e. delayed the onset of hyperglycemia and improved β-cell mass) in these mice (7Alejandro E.U. Bozadjieva N. Kumusoglu D. Abdulhamid S. Levine H. Haataja L. Vadrevu S. Satin L.S. Arvan P. Bernal-Mizrachi E. Disruption of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine signaling induces ER stress and beta cell failure.Cell Rep. 2015; 13 (26673325): 2527-253810.1016/j.celrep.2015.11.020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To examine whether a reduction in ER stress could also rescue CPE protein expression, we generated βOGTKO mice in a full Chop null background. Full deletion of Chop significantly but incompletely improved hyperglycemia in the Chop−/−;βOGTKO was compared with littermate βOGTKO mice (Fig. 3A). We previously showed increased Bip, an ER stress marker and regulator of unfolded protein response (UPR) activation, in βOGTKO islets (7Alejandro E.U. Bozadjieva N. Kumusoglu D. Abdulhamid S. Levine H. Haataja L. Vadrevu S. Satin L.S. Arvan P. Bernal-Mizrachi E. Disruption of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine signaling induces ER stress and beta cell failure.Cell Rep. 2015; 13 (26673325): 2527-253810.1016/j.celrep.2015.11.020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In islets from 1-month-old, normoglycemic mice, Chop−/−;βOGTKO islets, we showed a comparable level of Bip to the control Chop−/− islets, suggestive of normalization of the ER stress level in Chop−/−;βOGTKO model (Fig. 3, B and C). Although the Chop−/−;βOGTKO mice had reduced glucose levels compared with that of βOGTKO, the islet CPE protein level remained significantly reduced and proinsulin/insulin ratio high (Fig. 3, D–F), revealing the persistence of an insulin processing defect despite the reduction in ER stress mediated by Chop. We previously showed that Chop−/+;βOGTKO was sufficient to reduced glucose levels and rescue β-cell mass in βOGTKO mice. Interestingly, EM images revealed fewer insulin granules in Chop−/+;βOGTKO β-cells were compared with littermate controls, regardless of Chop status, and granules with a less dense core (Fig. 3G), a phenomena that has been linked to reduced mature insulin content (29Furuta M. Carroll R. Martin S. Swift H.H. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Steiner D.F. Incomplete processing of proinsulin to insulin accompanied by elevation of Des-31,32 proinsulin intermediates in islets of mice lacking active PC2.J. Biol.

This is consistent with our previous finding that total insulin content is reduced in βOGTKO (7Alejandro E.U. Bozadjieva N. Kumusoglu D. Abdulhamid S. Levine H. Haataja L. Vadrevu S. Satin L.S.

These data led us to conclude that Chop-mediated ER stress is not a major contributor to CPE loss or hyperproinsulinemia in β-cells deficient of OGT. In the absence of a direct OGT-CPE relationship, we hypothesized that CPE may be translationally modulated indirectly through OGT regulation of an upstream factor. One possibility is through eIF4G1, a requisite scaffolding protein in the translation initiation complex that has been recently implicated to regulate CPE specifically in β-cells (20Liew C.W. Assmann A. Templin A.T. Raum J.C. Lipson K.L. Rajan S. Qiang G. Hu J. Kawamori D. Lindberg I. Philipson L.H. Sonenberg N. Goldfine A.B. Stoffers D.A. Mirmira R.G. Urano F. Kulkarni R.N.

We first used an sWGA-pulldown in MIN6 cells to show that eIF4G1 is glycosylated (Fig. 4A) and confirmed its O-GlcNAcylation status both by RL2 IP with eIF4G1 immunoblotting (Fig. 4B) and through eIF4G1 IP with RL2 immunoblot, observing a clear band at the expected size of 250 kDa (Fig. 4C). We also found that eIF4G1 protein levels were significantly reduced in βOGTKO islets compared with control, without any changes in eIF4G1 transcript level (Fig. 4, D–F). Combined with the novel finding of eIF4G1 as a direct OGT target in β-cells, we hypothesized that the O-GlcNAcylation status of this protein may impact its translational function or stability.

Traditional approaches use historical data, knowledge of the species' ecology and time-consuming surveys. Within the past decade, environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a powerful additional tracking tool. While much work has been done with animals, comparatively very little has been done with aquatic plants. Here we investigated the transportation and seasonal changes in eDNA concentrations for an invasive aquatic species, Elodea canadensis, in Norway. A specific probe assay was developed using chloroplast DNA to study the fate of the targeted eDNA through space and time. The spatial study used a known source of Elodea canadensis within Lake Nordbytjern 400 m away from the lake outlet flowing into the stream Tveia. The rate of disappearance of E. canadensis eDNA was an order of magnitude loss over about 230 m in the lake and 1550 m in the stream. The time series study was performed monthly from May to October in lake Steinsfjorden harbouring E. canadensis, showing that eDNA concentrations varied by up to three orders of magnitude, peaking during fall. In both studies, the presence of suspended clay or turbidity for some samples did not hamper eDNA analysis. This study shows how efficient eDNA tools may be for tracking aquatic plants in the environment and provides key spatial and temporal information on the fate of eDNA."

We used 3- and 15-mo-old mice as well as 15-mo-old mice treated with vehicle and gefitinib to evaluate structural, cellular, and molecular changes in cortical bone. We found that the senescence of osteoprogenitors was increased, whereas the expression of phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the endosteal surface of cortical bone down-regulated in middle-aged 15-mo-old mice compared with young 3-mo-old mice. Further decreasing EGFR signaling by gefitinib treatment in middle-aged mice resulted in promoted senescence of osteoprogenitors and accelerated cortical bone degeneration. Moreover, inhibiting EGFR signaling suppressed the expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), the repressor of cell senescence-inducer genes, through ERK1/2 pathway, thereby promoting senescence in osteoprogenitors. Down-regulated EGFR signaling plays a physiologically significant role during aging by reducing Ezh2 expression, leading to the senescence of osteoprogenitors and the decline in bone formation on the endosteal surface of cortical bone.-Liu, G., Xie, Y., Su, J., Qin, H., Wu, H., Li, K., Yu, B., Zhang, X.

Here, we tested the efficacy of TMinh-23 for inhibition of GI motility in mice. In isolated murine gastric antrum, TMinh-23 strongly inhibited spontaneous and carbachol-stimulated rhythmic contractions. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed predicted therapeutic concentrations of TMinh-23 for at least 4 h following a single oral or intraperitoneal dose at 10 mg/kg. Gastric emptying, as assessed following an oral bolus of phenol red or independently by [99mTc]-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid scintigraphy, was reduced by TMinh-23 by ∼60% at 20 min. Interestingly, there was little effect of TMinh-23 on baseline whole-gut transit time or time to diarrhea induced by castor oil. Consequent to the delay in gastric emptying, TMinh-23 administration significantly reduced the elevation in blood sugar in mice following an oral but not intraperitoneal glucose load. These results provide pharmacological evidence for involvement of TMEM16A in gastric emptying and suggest the utility of TMEM16A inhibition in disorders of accelerated gastric emptying, such as dumping syndrome, and potentially for improving glucose tolerance in diabetes mellitus/metabolic syndrome and enhancing satiety in obesity.-Cil, O., Anderson, M.

A Warburg effect targeting group, rationally designed to facilitate uptake by glucose transporters and promote cellular accumulation due to phosphorylation by hexokinase (HK), has been synthesised. This targeting group, the C2 modified glucose analogue 2-(2-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy)-D-glucose, has been conjugated to the fluorophore nitrobenzoxadiazole to evaluate its effect on uptake and accumulation in cancer cells. The targeting vector has demonstrated inhibition of glucose phosphorylation by HK, indicating its interaction with the enzyme and thereby confirming the potential to facilitate an intracellular trapping mechanism for compounds it is conjugated with. The cellular uptake of the fluorescent analogue is dependent on the glucose concentration and is so to a greater extent than is that of the widely used fluorescent glucose analogue, 2-NBDG. It also demonstrates selective uptake in the hypoxic regions of 3D spheroid tumour models whereas 2-NBDG is distributed primarily through the normoxic regions of the spheroid. The increased selectivity is consistent with the blocking of alternative uptake pathways."

It is mainly grown as a significant protein source in developing countries. Salinity, as one of the main abiotic stress factors, constrains the normal growth and yield of asparagus bean. This study used two cultivars (a salt-sensitive genotype and a salt-tolerant genotype) under salt stress vs. control to identify salt-stress-induced genes in asparagus bean using RNA sequencing. A total of 692,086,838 high-quality clean reads, assigned to 121,138 unigenes, were obtained from control and salt-treated libraries. Then, 216 root-derived DEGs (differentially expressed genes) and 127 leaf-derived DEGs were identified under salt stress between the two cultivars. Of these DEGs, thirteen were assigned to six transcription factors (TFs), including AP2/EREBP, CCHC(Zn), C2H2, WRKY, WD40-like and LIM. GO analysis indicated four DEGs might take effects on the “oxidation reduction”, “transport” and “signal transduction” process. Moreover, expression of nine randomly-chosen DEGs was verified by quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Predicted function of the nine tested DEGs was mainly involved in the KEGG pathway of cation transport, response to osmotic stress, and phosphorelay signal transduction system. A salt-stress-related pathway of “SNARE interactions in vesicular transport” was concerned. As byproducts, 15, 321 microsatellite markers were found in all the unigenes, and 17 SNP linked to six salt-stress induced DEGs were revealed.

Though an existing body of research has identified cross-cultural differences in the emotional correlates of receiving different types of social support, researchers have seldom examined possible cultural differences in the experience of social support providers. This study used the Day Reconstruction Method to examine cultural differences in the emotional correlates of the provision of solicited and unsolicited and emotional and informational social support in the daily lives of Singaporean (n = 79) and American (n = 88) participants. Singaporean participants reported providing more social support overall. Regardless of culture, participants reported more positive emotion (affection, happiness) and less negative emotion (anger, anxiety) when they provided emotional social support. Also, multilevel modeling analyses revealed a 3-way interaction between culture, social support provision, and social support solicitation, indicating cultural differences in negative emotional responses to providing solicited social support. Specifically, results suggest that attempts to provide more solicited social support were associated with more negative emotions in the U.S. In contrast, provider negative emotions were highest in Singapore when the provider did not meet the recipient's request for support. Patterns of cultural differences in social support provision are dissimilar to-rather than simply mirroring-those found in published research on social support receipt, highlighting the importance of studying social support provision as a distinct phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2962051029,"Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes granuloma formation. Characterization of granulomatous lesions of Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) experimentally infected cattle has helped to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease. However, few studies have described granulomas found in M. bovis naturally infected cattle. The aim of this work was to examine granulomas from Holstein-Friesian cattle naturally infected with M. bovis from a dairy basin located in the central region of Mexico. Tissue samples from thirty-two cattle with lesions suggestive of tuberculosis were collected post-mortem. Fifteen of the 32 sampled animals (46.8%) were 4 months of age or younger (calves), whereas the rest (53.2%, 17/32) were over one year old (adults). Macroscopic lesions suggestive of tuberculosis were found in the mediastinal lymph node chain of all animals (32/32). From the 1,143 granulomatous lesions that were microscopically analyzed, 34.6% (396/1143) were collected from adult animals and subsequently classified according to the nomenclature suggested by Wangoo et al., 2005. Surprisingly, lesions from calf tissues showed an atypical pattern which could not be fitted into the established developmental stages of this classification. Granulomatous lesions found in calves covered most of the affected organ, histologically showed large necrotic areas with central calcification, absence of a connective tissue capsule, and few giant cells. Also, there was a higher percentage of lesions with acid-fast bacilli (AFB) when compared to studied granulomas in adults. Growth of Mycobacterium spp was detected in 11 bacteriological tissue cultures. Genotypic identification of M. bovis was performed by DNA extraction from bacterial isolates, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues and samples without bacterial isolation. M. bovis was detected by PCR in 84.3% (27/32) of the studied cases; whereas other AFB were observed in tissues of the remaining sampled animals (5/32). Our results describe atypical granuloma formation in calves 4 months of age or younger, naturally infected with M. bovis. These findings contribute to better understanding the physiopathology of M. bovis infection in cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2961702267,"Benzoxazinoid (Bx) metabolites produced by wheat and other members of the Poaceae have activity against Fusarium sp. that cause cereal diseases including Fusarium head blight (FHB) on wheat and barley. Certain Bx metabolites can be detoxified by Fusarium sp. with the arylamine N-acetyltransferase NAT1. Investigation of this pathway may reveal strategies for increasing FHB resistance, such as selection for higher levels of Bx metabolites within existing germplasm and/or engineering fungal susceptibility via host induced silencing of NAT1. We assessed the reactions of fifteen wheat cultivars or breeding lines adapted to the Northwestern United States to infection with F. graminearum Δnat1 mutants that should be sensitive to Bx metabolites. Significant differences were noted in disease severity and deoxynivalenol (DON) among the cultivars 21 d after inoculation with either mutant or wildtype (PH1) strains. Mutant vs. wildtype strains did not result in significant variation for infection severity (as measured by % infected florets), but inoculation with Δnat1 mutants vs. wildtype resulted in significantly lower DON concentrations in mature kernels (p < 0.0001). Of the cultivars tested, HRS3419 was the most resistant cultivar to PH1 (severity = 62%, DON = 45 ppm) and Δnat1 mutants (severity = 61%, DON = 30 ppm). The cultivar most susceptible to infection was Kelse with PH1 (severity = 100%, DON = 292 ppm) and Δnat1 mutants (severity = 100%, DON = 158 ppm). We hypothesized that sub-lethal Bx metabolite levels may suppress DON production in F. graminearum Δnat1 mutants. In vitro assays of Bx metabolites BOA, MBOA, and DIMBOA at 30 μM did not affect growth, but did reduce DON production by Δnat1 and PH1. Although the levels of Bx metabolites are likely too low in the wheat cultivars we tested to suppress FHB, higher levels of Bx metabolites may contribute towards reductions in DON and FHB."

However, to what extent the absence of de novo dNTP production can be compensated for by the salvage pathway is unknown. Here, we eliminated de novo dNTP synthesis in the mouse heart and skeletal muscle by inactivating ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), a key enzyme for the de novo production of dNTPs, at embryonic day 13. All other tissues had normal de novo dNTP synthesis and theoretically could supply heart and skeletal muscle with deoxyribonucleosides needed for dNTP production by salvage. We observed that the dNTP and NTP pools in WT postnatal hearts are unexpectedly asymmetric, with unusually high dGTP and GTP levels compared with those in whole mouse embryos or murine cell cultures. We found that RNR inactivation in heart led to strongly decreased dGTP and increased dCTP, dTTP, and dATP pools; aberrant DNA replication; defective expression of muscle-specific proteins; progressive heart abnormalities; disturbance of the cardiac conduction system; and lethality between the second and fourth weeks after birth. We conclude that dNTP salvage cannot substitute for de novo dNTP synthesis in the heart and that cardiomyocytes and myocytes initiate DNA replication despite an inadequate dNTP supply.

Chondrocytes undergo changes to their protein translational capacity during osteoarthritis, but a study of how disease-relevant signals affect chondrocyte protein translation at the transcriptomic level has not previously been performed. In this study, we describe how the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1-β (IL-1β) rapidly affects protein translation in the chondrocytic cell line SW1353. Using ribosome profiling we demonstrate that IL-1β induced altered translation of inflammatory-associated transcripts such as NFKB1, TNFAIP2, MMP13, CCL2, and CCL7, as well as a number of ribosome-associated transcripts, through differential translation and the use of multiple open reading frames. Proteomic analysis of the cellular layer and the conditioned media of these cells identified changes in a number of the proteins that were differentially translated. Translationally regulated secreted proteins included a number of chemokines and cytokines, underlining the rapid, translationally mediated inflammatory cascade that is initiated by IL-1β. Although fewer cellular proteins were found to be regulated in both ribosome profiling and proteomic data sets, we did find increased levels of SOD2, indicative of redox changes within SW1353 cells being modulated at the translational level. In conclusion, we have produced combined ribosome profiling and proteomic data sets that provide a valuable resource in understanding the processes that occur during cytokine stimulation of chondrocytic cells.

To ensure survival despite rNMP insertions, cells have evolved a complex network of DNA repair mechanisms, in which the ribonucleotide excision repair pathway, initiated by type 2 RNase H (RNase HII/2), plays a major role. We recently demonstrated that eukaryotic RNase H2 cannot repair damage, that is, ribose monophosphate abasic (both apurinic or apyrimidinic) site (rAP) or oxidized rNMP embedded in DNA. Currently, it remains unclear why RNase H2 is unable to repair these modified nucleic acids having either only a sugar moiety or an oxidized base. Here, we compared the endoribonuclease specificity of the RNase HII enzymes from the archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi and the bacterium Escherichia coli, examining their ability to process damaged rNMPs embedded in DNA in vitro. We found that E. coli RNase HII cleaves both rAP and oxidized rNMP sites. In contrast, like the eukaryotic RNase H2, P. abyssi RNase HII did not display any rAP or oxidized rNMP incision activities, even though it recognized them. Notably, the archaeal enzyme was also inactive on a mismatched rNMP, whereas the E. coli enzyme displayed a strong preference for the mispaired rNMP over the paired rNMP in DNA. On the basis of our biochemical findings and also structural modeling analyses of RNase HII/2 proteins from organisms belonging to all three domains of life, we propose that RNases HII/2's dual roles in ribonucleotide excision repair and RNA/DNA hydrolysis result in limited acceptance of modified rNMPs embedded in DNA.

Finally, in Eukarya, RNase H2 is a heterotrimeric protein. Subunit A resembles the bacterial ortholog and comprises the catalytic domain of the whole protein. Moreover, two additional subunits, called B and C, are present (24Chon H. Vassilev A. DePamphilis M.L. Zhao Y. Zhang J. Burgers P.M. Crouch R.J. Cerritelli S.M. Contributions of the two accessory subunits, RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C, to the activity and properties of the human RNase H2 complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 (19015152): 96-11010.1093/nar/gkn913Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although their functions are still not completely understood, their absence abolishes the catalytic activity of the A subunit (17Cerritelli S.M. Crouch R.J.

In addition, subunit B contains the proliferating cell nuclear antigen–interacting motif (PIP box) that allows recruitment of the enzyme to the replication fork (25Bubeck D. Reijns M.A. Graham S.C.

Whether and how the protein structure impacts the protein functions needs further investigation. In this study, we compared the endoribonuclease activities of RNases HII from a bacterial and an archaeon representative species on rAP or oxidized rNMP embedded in DNA. We found that Escherichia coli RNase HII, which is able to cut normal rGMPs embedded in DNA, maintains its endoribonuclease activity on both abasic and oxidized rGMPs present in DNA. On the contrary, P. abyssi RNase HII loses this catalytic specificity. Like the human counterpart, the archaeal RNase HII enzyme exhibits stable substrate binding, although it is unable to process modified rNMPs embedded in DNA. Based on these biochemical data and alignment of amino acid sequences and structures, we speculated that the requirement of the enzymes to recognize rNMPs in DNA and resolve RNA/DNA hybrids limits the optimally recognition process and catalysis of modified rNMPs embedded in DNA. ribonucleoside monophosphate ribose monophosphate abasic (both apurinic or apyrimidinic) site oxidized ribonucleoside monophosphate ribonucleotide excision repair type 2 ribonuclease H oligonucleotide base excision repair single-stranded double-stranded ribosomal RNA Protein Data Bank. RNase H type 2 is the major enzyme responsible for the removal of unmodified rNMPs embedded in DNA (24Chon H. Vassilev A. DePamphilis M.L. Zhao Y. Zhang J. Burgers P.M. Crouch R.J. Cerritelli S.M. Contributions of the two accessory subunits, RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C, to the activity and properties of the human RNase H2 complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 (19015152): 96-11010.1093/nar/gkn913Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar); unexpectedly, we recently demonstrated that yeast, mouse, and human RNase H2 enzymes are unable to process rAP or oxidized rNMP embedded in DNA (20Malfatti M.C. Balachander S. Antoniali G. Koh K.D. Saint-Pierre C. Gasparutto D. Chon H. Crouch R.J. Storici F. Tell G. Abasic and oxidized ribonucleotides embedded in DNA are processed by human APE1 and not by RNase H2.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28977421): 11193-1121210.1093/nar/gkx723Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here, we examined whether RNase HII from E. coli cleaves a rAP embedded in a 40-bp DNA sequence (Fig. 1A). We used single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds) DNA substrates containing either an rGMP (rG) or a THF (rF), analog of the rAP (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Following incubation, denaturing gel electrophoresis was used to visualize the cleavage (Fig. 1B). As expected, E. coli RNase HII cleaves the single rG in the DNA duplex substrate (lane 9 in Fig. 1B). In addition, E. coli RNase HII also cleaves rG when present in the ssDNA substrate, although with less efficiency than the dsDNA substrate (lanes 7 and 8 and lane 9, respectively, in Fig. 1B). Interestingly, E. coli RNase HII cleaves also the rAP in the dsDNA but not in the ssDNA substrate (lanes 12 and lanes 10 and 11, respectively, in Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that E. coli RNase HII is able to cleave a rAP when this is incorporated in a DNA duplex. Next, we extended our interests on the ability of E. coli RNase HII protein to process a true abasic (ds_rOH:dC), containing an hydroxyl group in C1′ rather than a THF group, and an oxidized rNMP (ds_r8oxoG:dC) within ds oligonucleotides (ODNs) compared with control dsODNs (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Specifically, the control oligonucleotides include the negative controls dGMP- and 8-oxoguanine dNMP–containing ODNs, called ds_dG:dC and ds_d8oxoG:dC, respectively, and the positive control, in which an unmodified rGMP was embedded, called ds_rG:dC (Fig. 2 and Table 1). All modifications are located at the 13th position over a length of 25 ODNs. Moreover, because oxidized G can pair with dC or dA, both rG- and r8oxoG-containing strands, as well as dG control substrate, were annealed with either dC- or dA-containing complementary strands (Fig. 2 and Table 1). To better investigate the cleavage activity of the bacterial RNase HII, each dsODN was first incubated with the recombinant E. coli protein for the indicated times (Fig. 2). Upon reaction completion, denaturing gel electrophoresis was used to quantify the amount of cleaved product (Fig. 2A). Then the percentage of product obtained upon cleavage was calculated and compared among all the ODNs (Fig. 2B). As expected, data obtained showed that bacterial RNase HII efficiently cuts, in a time-dependent manner, its canonical substrate paired with dCMP (ds_rG:dC) and also in a mispaired condition with an dAMP (ds_rG:dA). Under the same conditions, as expected, no effect was observed for RNase HII on the ds_d8oxoG:dC and ds_dG:dC ODNs. Notably, bacterial RNase HII was able to cleave the r8oxoG ODN as efficiently as its positive controls and, compared with the ds_rG:dC, even to a higher extent. In fact, after 60 min of incubation with the enzyme, cleavage of the ds_r8oxoG:dC substrate was 50% higher than that of the ds_rG:dC oligonucleotide. Interestingly, when ds_rG:dC is considered with respect to the ds_rG:dA substrate, the presence of the mismatch with adenine in place of cytosine influenced bacterial RNase HII cleavage capability, which results markedly more active to process the rGMP (Fig. 2). In addition, the efficiency of cleavage of ds_r8oxoG:dA by the bacterial RNase HII was comparable with that of ds_r8oxoG:dC (Fig. 2). Our results also confirmed that E. coli RNase HII is active on rAP embedded in DNA, as observed by the presence of cleavage products accumulating with ds_rOH:dC (see results in Fig. 1). With the purpose of verifying that the observed activity of the E. coli RNase HII was not a consequence of contamination of the commercial enzyme by RNase A, despite having information about the purity of the protein (∼99%), we performed additional control experiments. First, we tested the efficiency of RNase A cleavage on genomic RNA extracted from HeLa cells compared with the activity detectable in the presence of increasing amounts of E. coli RNase HII (Fig. 2C). After 1 h of RNase A incubation with eukaryotic total RNA, in a ratio of [RNase A/genomic RNA] of 2.5*10−4, a complete degradation of RNA was observed. Indeed, the two bands corresponding to the 28S and 18S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) were sharply visible when RNase A was not present, whereas a complete rRNA degradation was clearly observed when RNase A was present. On the contrary, E. coli RNase HII treatment did not affect RNA stability at all (Fig. 2C), confirming the absence of RNase A contamination in the E. coli RNase HII samples. Using the same conditions, we compared the cleavage activity, by both RNases, on all the rNMP-containing DNA substrates. As shown in Fig. 2D, whereas E. coli RNase HII cleaved the substrates containing the modified rNMPs, RNase A did not. These data clearly demonstrate the absence of contaminating RNase A having RNase H-like activity in the commercial RNase HII sample, and, more importantly, that the bacterial RNase HII enzyme, but not RNase A, specifically processes lesions including oxidized rNMP and rAP embedded in DNA. It is well-known that the presence of magnesium ion is necessary for promoting the cleavage activity of E. coli RNase HII (20Malfatti M.C. Balachander S. Antoniali G. Koh K.D. Saint-Pierre C.

Here, we investigated the cleavage specificity of the bacterial RNase HII comparing its activity in the presence and absence of magnesium in the reaction buffer. Although in the previous experiments the commercial buffer was used, we prepared a homemade buffer, in which we added or not MgSO4 from the original recipe. As reported in Fig. 2 (E and F), when magnesium is present, the activity of RNase HII is promoted in both unmodified and oxidized rG (lanes 2–4). When the MgSO4 is not added into the reaction buffer and, in addition, any divalent ions are chelated by the presence of EDTA, the RNase HII is inactive on the substrates containing the modified rNMPs (lanes 5–7). Taking all these results together, we demonstrated that E. coli RNase HII, differently from its mammalian and yeast counterparts (20Malfatti M.C. Balachander S. Antoniali G. Koh K.D. Saint-Pierre C.

Genetic iron overload related to hepcidin insufficiency decreases the spleen iron concentration and increases hepatic iron concentration, whereas during secondary iron overload, the hepcidin expression increases together with spleen iron concentration in addition to hepatic iron concentrations increase. Links between iron metabolism and other metals being suggested, our aim was to investigate, during iron overload, the relationships between the hepatic hepcidin expression level and the hepatic and splenic concentrations of iron, manganese, copper, zinc, and molybdenum, determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Hepcidin-deficient mice, secondary iron overload mice models, and their respective controls were studied. Spleen molybdenum and manganese concentrations paralleled the modulation of both spleen iron concentrations, increasing in secondary iron overload and decreasing in hepcidin deficiency related iron overload, as well as hepatic hepcidin mRNA expression. Our data suggest that iron, manganese, and molybdenum metabolisms could share mechanisms controlling their distribution that are associated to hepcidin modulation. In diseases with abnormal hepcidin levels, including chronic inflammation, special attention should be paid to those metals that can participate with the phenotype.—Cavey, T., Latour, C., Island, M.-L., Leroyer, P., Guggenbuhl, P., Coppin, H., Roth, M.-P., Bendavid, C., Brissot, P., Ropert, M., Loréal, O.

Four conditions were used: Eyes Open/Closed vs. Head Normal/Bent Back. 'Center of Pressure' (CoP) signals were decomposed into 'Center of Mass' (CoM) and the remaining difference between Center of Pressure and Center of Mass (CoPM). The Zero-Crossing points in which the Center of Mass and Center of Pressure paths cross each other have been extracted. Velocity of CoM, velocity of CoPM and acceleration of CoPM in Zero-Crossing points were analyzed to be potential markers of balance efficiency. Three factors causing the deterioration of balance quality were analyzed: closing eyes, bending the head back and patient age. The influence of the given factors was measured using the significance p of the t-Student test and Cohen's d effect size and applied to differences for the logarithms of three of the mentioned above variables measured without and with the given deteriorating factor. In the majority of comparisons, the proposed new parameters of balance quality possessed higher statistical power to detect deteriorated balance quality than the standard parameters: standard deviation of the signal and ellipse area covering 90% of the signal envelope. Most valuable are the velocity and acceleration of CoPM for the medio-lateral direction. Logarithms of the analyzed parameters are proposed to be used in analyses because they possess normal or close to normal distribution and they are less sensitive to single high values occurring often in measurements."

We included 22 children with SCA who were followed for an average of 14.5 months. Laboratory parameters were assessed by electronic methods, and molecular analysis was investigated by PCR-RFLP and allele-specific PCR. Results showed significant increases in hemoglobin, HbF, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, glucose, HDL-C and albumin levels, as well as significant decreases in MCHC and AST levels, WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes and reticulocytes, in children during HU therapy. HbF levels were positively correlated with hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV and total protein, yet negatively correlated with MCHC, RDW, AAT and AST during HU therapy (p<0.05). Children who carried the Central African Republic haplotype, in response to HU therapy, presented significant increases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, triglycerides and uric acid levels, as well as significant decreases in MCHC, AST and direct bilirubin levels, WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes and reticulocytes. Those with the Benin haplotype presented increases in HbF and albumin levels, and a reduction in platelet counts (p<0.05). Children with α-thalassemia presented decreased ALT during HU use, while those without this deletion presented increases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, HDL-C and albumin, as well as decreases in MCHC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, reticulocytes and AST (p<0.05). Hence, regardless of its use in association with βS haplotypes or α-thalassemia, HU seems to be linked to alterations in hemolytic, inflammatory, hepatic, lipid and glycemic profiles."

Cell therapy with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) has been demonstrated to enhance wound healing in diabetic mice, at least partly due to improved growth factor production. However, it is unclear whether MSC can biomechanically affect wound closure. Utilizing the well-established cell-populated collagen gel contraction model we investigated the interactions between MSC and the extracellular matrix.Murine fetal liver-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) or fetal Dermal Fibroblasts (DFs) were cultured in cell-populated collagen gels (CPCGs). The effect of cell density, conditioned media, growth factors (TGF-B1, FGF, PDGF-BB), cytoskeletal disruptors (colchicine, cytochalasin-D), and relative hypoxia on gel contraction were evaluated. Finally, we also measured the expression of integrin receptors and some growth factors by MSCs within the contracting gels.Our results show that at different densities, MSCs induced a higher gel contraction compared to DFs. Higher cell density resulted in faster and more complete contraction of CPCGs. Cytoskeletal inhibitors either inhibited or prevented MSC-mediated contraction in a dose dependent fashion. Growth factors, conditioned media from both MSC and DF, and hypoxia all influenced CPCG contraction.The results suggest that MSCs are capable of directly contributing to wound closure through matrix contraction, and they are more effective than DF. In addition, this study demonstrates the importance of how other factors such as cell concentration, cytokines, and oxygen tension can provide potential modulation of therapies to correct wound healing impairments."
https://openalex.org/W2958326979,"Energy balance is essential for all species. Ligand-receptor interactions mediate processes that regulate body activities like reproduction and metabolism based on the energy status. Such receptors are the heparan sulfate proteoglycans and specifically the family of syndecans. Therefore we investigated the differences of metabolic parameters of heterozygous Syndecan 1 mice (Sdc1+/-) with reduced expression of Sdc1 and the corresponding wild type mice. Sdc1+/- mice have a reduced body weight although they show increased leptin and decreased corticosterone levels. Furthermore, their food and water intake is increased. This is accompanied with less adipose tissue, smaller adipocytes and thus an increased density of adipocytes. For the detailed analysis of the metabolism the automated PhenoMaster system has been used, which allowed continuous and undisturbed recording of food and water intake, energy expenditure and movement. The reason for the lower body weight was the higher energy expenditure of these animals compared to controls. Additionally, female Sdc1+/- mice showed an increased locomotor activity. Referring to organs, the intestine in Sdc1+/- mice was heavier and longer, but no differences at the cellular level could be observed. These findings were independent of normal mating or vice versa embryo transfers of Sdc1+/- and wild type embryos in recipient females of the other genotype. Herein we showed that the reduced expression of Sdc1 led to an altered metabolism on fetal as well as on maternal side, which may play a role in the growth restriction observed in human pregnancy pathologies and in mice lacking Sdc1."

https://openalex.org/W2958331340,"The closed testing principle provides strong control of the type I error probabilities of tests of a set of hypotheses that are closed under intersection such that a given hypothesis H can only be tested and rejected at level α if all intersection hypotheses containing that hypothesis are also tested and rejected at level α. For the higher order hypotheses, multivariate tests (> 1df) are generally employed. However, such tests are directed to an omnibus alternative hypothesis of a difference in any direction for any component that may be less meaningful than a test directed against a restricted alternative hypothesis of interest.Herein we describe applications of this principle using an α-level test of a surrogate hypothesis [Formula: see text] such that the type I error probability is preserved if [Formula: see text] such that rejection of [Formula: see text] implies rejection of H. Applications include the analysis of multiple event times in a Wei-Lachin test against a one-directional alternative, a test of the treatment group difference in the means of K repeated measures using a 1 df test of the difference in the longitudinal LSMEANS, and analyses within subgroups when a test of treatment by subgroup interaction is significant. In such cases the successive higher order surrogate tests can be aimed at detecting parameter values that fall within a more desirable restricted subspace of the global alternative hypothesis parameter space.Closed testing using α-level tests of surrogate hypotheses will protect the type I error probability and detect specific alternatives of interest, as opposed to the global alternative hypothesis of any difference in any direction."
https://openalex.org/W2962026947,"It is difficult to simulate both the flow field and the chemical reaction using, respectively, the flow state and kinetics calculations and actually reflect the influence of the gas flow state on the chemical change in a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system. In this study, the flow field and the chemical reaction were therefore coupled to simulate a full Cu-Zeolite SCR system and the boundary conditions of the simulation were set by a relevant diesel engine bench test which included the exhaust temperature, the mass flow, and the exhaust pressure. Then, the influence of the gas flow state on the NOx conversion efficiency was investigated. Specifically, an orthogonal experimental design was used to study the influence of the injection parameters (position, angle, and speed) on the NH3 distribution by establishing the NH3 uniformity coefficient γ at the SCR catalyst capture surface in the flow field simulation. Then, the velocity capture surface of the SCR catalyst front section was sliced into coupled data transfer interfaces to study the effects of exhaust temperature, ammonia to NOx ratio (ANR), and the NO2/NOx on the NOx conversion efficiency. This was used as guidelines to optimize the SCR system control strategy. The results showed that a 1150 mm injection position, a 45°injection angle, and a 23 m/s injection velocity provided the most uniform NH3 distribution on the SCR catalyst capture surface. For constant injection parameters, the NOx conversion efficiency was the highest when the exhaust temperature was 200°C—400°C, the ANR was 1.1, and NO2/NOx was 0.5."

https://openalex.org/W2958307876,"The sexes in humans and other animals typically display numerous differences. This belies the fact that the two major hormone classes responsible for these differences, androgens and estrogens, differ only subtly in their chemical backbones. Androgens have a six-carbon nonaromatic ring—the “A ring” (Fig. 1)—in their steroid skeleton, whereas estrogens have an aromatic A ring. Remarkably, a single protein, steroid aromatase (also called estrogen synthase), is the only known enzyme capable of “aromatizing” the A ring in androgens such as testosterone and androstenedione to produce estrogens such as estradiol and estrone. Females and males require both sex hormones in a balance appropriate for each sex. A chief role of steroid aromatase, along with those of other enzymes that modify or metabolize steroid hormones, is to maintain this healthy balance, for example, during development and pregnancy and in reproductive tissues. Accordingly, researchers have long sought to better understand steroid aromatase activity in order to reduce pregnancy complications, develop hormone-based contraceptives, and manage estrogen-responsive cancers. Three papers published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, authored by Kenneth J. Ryan and recognized as Classics here (1Ryan K.J. Engel L.L. Hydroxylation of steroids at carbon 21.J. Biol.

Before embarking on his studies of steroid aromatase, Ryan, along with co-author Lewis Engel, discovered that microsomal fractions of adrenal glands from beef contain an enzyme activity that hydroxylates carbon 21 in the hormone progesterone and several of its derivatives (1Ryan K.J. Engel L.L. Hydroxylation of steroids at carbon 21.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 225 (13416221): 103-114http://www.jbc.org/content/225/1/103.longAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding clarified the enzymatic nature of this pivotal step in steroid hormone production in adrenal tissues. It revealed that this step consists of an oxidative reaction that requires microsomes, NADPH, and molecular oxygen. It also helped establish an experimental system that Ryan could then use to probe how estrogens are made from androgens. “[He was] trying to figure out the physiology of pregnancy, what the estrogens were doing, and how they how they arose,” says Richard Auchus, Professor of Internal Medicine and Pharmacology at the University of Michigan and a researcher with a long-standing research interest in steroid production and modification. The in vivo conversion of an androgen to estrogenic activity was noted more than 80 years ago, when Steinach and Kun (4Steinach E. Kun H. Transformation of male sex hormones into a substance with the action of a female hormone.Lancet. 1937; 133: 845Abstract Scopus (22) Google Scholar), using a bioassay that measured hormone activities only indirectly, reported that men given testosterone have higher estrogenic activity in urine. This finding suggested that estrogens can be formed from androgens, and further studies in the 1950s with extracts from animal tissues hinted at the enzymatic nature of this conversion (5Meyer A.S.

Acta. 1955; 17 (13239703): 441-44210.1016/0006-3002(55)90395-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Meyer A.S. Hayano M. Lindberg M.C. Gut M. Rodgers O.G.

However, the activities in these preparations were insufficient to study the nature of the androgen-to-estrogen conversion and its roles in human health and reproduction. This dearth in available methods to investigate this conversion prompted Ryan, then a clinician-researcher at Harvard Medical School, to try to boost estrogen production, extract these hormones more efficiently, and begin to characterize the enzymes involved. “He was one of the first people who did that sort of stuff,” says Auchus. Moreover, Ryan was an obstetrician, meaning that he had a ready supply of tissue ideal for investigating estrogen production—human placentas obtained immediately after delivery. Preparing and analyzing these biological materials was laborious, requiring many time-consuming steps now seldom performed in biochemistry labs. Ryan had to carefully extract the enzyme activities from kilograms of placental tissues, and even small glitches in the experimental protocols could result in loss of activity after hours of preparation. “These were some of the first very brave steps to try to figure out where [estrogens] were coming from,” says Auchus. This effort bore fruit when, in 1959, Ryan confirmed that the formation of the aromatic A ring is the result of enzymatic activity leading to aromatization (2Ryan K.J. Biological aromatization of steroids.J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234 (13630892): 268-272http://www.jbc.org/content/234/2/268.longAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). “He figured out that [the enzyme activity] was in the microsomal fraction and that it required NADPH, and he developed the chromatography to measure it,” Auchus says. Ryan's findings suggested that the aromatization involved an enzyme system that used molecular oxygen to achieve A-ring aromatization—yet, quite paradoxically, no extra oxygen atoms were retained in the estrogen products. With the tools available at the time, Ryan could not delineate the exact biochemical sequence of events, nor could he isolate the enzyme(s) responsible or the reaction intermediates that bore the tell-tale oxygen atoms. According to Auchus, initially it wasn't even clear whether the aromatization was performed by one enzyme or by several because the reaction sequence required at least three oxidations, which yielded some, at the time, unusual products. “[It] was fascinating that you got an aromatic A ring, [but] this did not really make a lot of sense to people back then.” says Auchus. “The reaction was weird because it involved both loss of a methyl group and formation of the aromatic A ring.” The reactions remained black boxes, but Ryan's work had begun to pry the lids open. “Now people could start to look at the mechanism,” says Auchus. Studies in the 1980s revealed that the aromatizing activity is indeed performed by just one enzyme, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (7Mendelson C.R. Wright E.E. Evans C.T. Porter J.C. Simpson E.R.

This enzyme, aptly named steroid aromatase, oxidizes carbon 19 (a methyl group attached to the A ring in androgens) in a multistep reaction sequence, starting with two sequential hydroxylations and culminating in an unusual C–C bond cleavage, leading to C-19 elimination and formation of the phenolic A ring in estrogens (Fig. 1). However, as Auchus notes, the details of the third aromatase-catalyzed step remained long unresolved and were somewhat controversial. “People fairly quickly figured out where the first two reactions occurred, but the third reaction [resulting in formic acid release from carbon 19 and the A-ring aromatization] was a vexing step that people could not work out for a long time.” Recent work has now shown that this reaction involves abstraction of a hydrogen atom from carbon 1 of the 19-gem-diol, rearrangement with loss of the formic acid prior to oxygen rebound, and, finally, keto-enol tautomerization to form the phenolic A ring (10Yoshimoto F.K.

Ryan next set his sights on establishing the biochemical origins of another important estrogen, estriol, now a standard biomarker in routine pregnancy care. One classic pathway of estriol formation involved the hydroxylation of carbon 16 in the estrogens estradiol and estrone. However, in an earlier study, Ryan had found preliminary evidence for another pathway in which estriol also could be produced by aromatization of C-16–hydroxylated androgens (11Ryan K.J. Conversion of Δ5-androstene-3β,16α,17β-triol to estriol by human placenta.Endocrinology. 1958; 63 (13574097): 392-39410.1210/endo-63-3-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Using his placental microsomal enzyme system, Ryan confirmed his earlier finding of estriol production from 16α-testosterone. He also clarified that another estrogen, 16α-hydroxyestrone, is an intermediate in the classic estriol-producing pathway (3Ryan K.J. Metabolism of C-16–oxygenated steroids by human placenta: the formation of estriol.J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234 (13673004): 2006-2008http://www.jbc.org/content/234/8/2006.longAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These discoveries underscored the utility of Ryan's assay and represented key early steps in untangling the biochemical complexities in estrogen production. Born in 1926 in New York City, Ryan grew up during the Great Depression, working on farms in his teen years and, following graduation from high school, serving in the United States Navy during World War II (12Schiff I. Frigoletto F. Obituary for Kenneth J. Ryan, M.D.Fertil. Steril. 2002; 78: 1136-113710.1016/S0015-0282(02)04235-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Upon returning from the war, he enrolled in Northwestern University for his undergraduate studies and then joined Harvard Medical School, graduating magna cum laude in 1952. During a couple of residencies at hospitals in the Boston area, Ryan landed a biochemistry fellowship shared with Nobel Laureate Fritz Lipmann, enabling him to pursue his interest in the roles of estrogens in the biology of pregnancy. In the 1960s, thanks to his managerial skills and knack for anticipating future directions in clinical research, Ryan began taking on administrative duties, successively becoming chairman of several obstetrics and gynecology departments across the country. In the early 1970s, he returned to Harvard where he helped build an academic OB-GYN department. In addition to his work in the clinic and extensive research activities, Ryan trained and mentored many students and residents. He also became active in medical ethics. “He actually got involved with a lot of ethical issues, like fetal tissue research,” Auchus says. “In his later years, he became a pretty prominent person in that field.” Notably, Ryan chaired the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. This commission produced the Belmont Report in 1978, whose guidelines for protecting the rights and dignity of human subjects in research continue to provide an ethical framework for research and health providers in the United States to this day. Ryan also was an early and strong proponent of reproductive choice. He died in 2002 at the age of 75."
