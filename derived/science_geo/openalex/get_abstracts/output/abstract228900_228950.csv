https://openalex.org/W2103819062,"The Fifth World Parks Congress in Durban, South Africa, announced in September 2003 that the global network of protected areas now covers 11.5% of the planet's land surface1. This surpasses the 10% target proposed a decade earlier, at the Caracas Congress2, for 9 out of 14 major terrestrial biomes1. Such uniform targets based on percentage of area have become deeply embedded into national and international conservation planning3. Although politically expedient, the scientific basis and conservation value of these targets have been questioned4,5. In practice, however, little is known of how to set appropriate targets, or of the extent to which the current global protected area network fulfils its goal of protecting biodiversity. Here, we combine five global data sets on the distribution of species and protected areas to provide the first global gap analysis assessing the effectiveness of protected areas in representing species diversity. We show that the global network is far from complete, and demonstrate the inadequacy of uniform—that is, ‘one size fits all’—conservation targets."
https://openalex.org/W2127808790,"To explain the evolution of cooperation by natural selection has been a major goal of biologists since Darwin. Cooperators help others at a cost to themselves, while defectors receive the benefits of altruism without providing any help in return. The standard game dynamical formulation is the ‘Prisoner's Dilemma’1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, in which two players have a choice between cooperation and defection. In the repeated game, cooperators using direct reciprocity cannot be exploited by defectors, but it is unclear how such cooperators can arise in the first place12,13,14,15. In general, defectors are stable against invasion by cooperators. This understanding is based on traditional concepts of evolutionary stability and dynamics in infinite populations16,17,18,19,20. Here we study evolutionary game dynamics in finite populations21,22,23,24,25. We show that a single cooperator using a strategy like ‘tit-for-tat’ can invade a population of defectors with a probability that corresponds to a net selective advantage. We specify the conditions required for natural selection to favour the emergence of cooperation and define evolutionary stability in finite populations."
https://openalex.org/W2100278941,"Small, compact genomes of ultrasmall unicellular algae provide information on the basic and essential genes that support the lives of photosynthetic eukaryotes, including higher plants1,2. Here we report the 16,520,305-base-pair sequence of the 20 chromosomes of the unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae 10D as the first complete algal genome. We identified 5,331 genes in total, of which at least 86.3% were expressed. Unique characteristics of this genomic structure include: a lack of introns in all but 26 genes; only three copies of ribosomal DNA units that maintain the nucleolus; and two dynamin genes that are involved only in the division of mitochondria and plastids. The conserved mosaic origin of Calvin cycle enzymes in this red alga and in green plants supports the hypothesis of the existence of single primary plastid endosymbiosis. The lack of a myosin gene, in addition to the unexpressed actin gene, suggests a simpler system of cytokinesis. These results indicate that the C. merolae genome provides a model system with a simple gene composition for studying the origin, evolution and fundamental mechanisms of eukaryotic cells."

https://openalex.org/W1985700942,"The determination of the star-formation history of the Universe is a key goal of modern cosmology, as it is crucial to our understanding of how galactic structures form and evolve. Observations1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 of young stars in distant galaxies at different times in the past have indicated that the stellar birthrate peaked some eight billion years ago before declining by a factor of around ten to its present value. Here we report an analysis of the ‘fossil record’ of the current stellar populations of 96,545 nearby galaxies, from which we obtained a complete star-formation history. Our results broadly support those derived from high-redshift galaxies. We find, however, that the peak of star formation was more recent—around five billion years ago. We also show that the bigger the stellar mass of the galaxy, the earlier the stars were formed, which indicates that high- and low-mass galaxies have very different histories."
https://openalex.org/W2004472669,"The Greenland ice-sheet would melt faster in a warmer climate and is likely to be eliminated — except for residual glaciers in the mountains — if the annual average temperature in Greenland increases by more than about 3 °C. This could raise the global average sea-level by 7 metres over a period of 1,000 years or more. We show here that concentrations of greenhouse gases will probably have reached levels before the year 2100 that are sufficient to raise the temperature past this warming threshold."

https://openalex.org/W1969275607,"Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is a ubiquitous enzyme that cross-links glutamine residues with lysine residues, resulting in protein polymerization, cross-linking of dissimilar proteins, and incorporation of diamines and polyamines into proteins. It has not previously been known to have kinase activity. Recently, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) has been reported to be phosphorylated by breast cancer cell membranes. We purified the IGFBP-3 kinase activity from solubilized T47D breast cancer cell membranes using gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, and IGFBP-3 affinity chromatography. The fractions containing kinase activity were further purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed by tandem mass spectroscopy. TG2 was detected in fractions containing kinase activity. Antisera to TG2 and protein A-Sepharose were used to immunoprecipitate TG2 from membrane fractions. The immunoprecipitates retained IGFBP-3 kinase, whereas immunoprecipitation deleted kinase activity in the membrane supernatant. The inhibitors of TG2, cystamine and monodansyl cadaverine, abolished the ability of the T47D cell membrane preparation to phosphorylate IGFBP-3. Both TG2 purified from guinea pig liver and recombinant human TG2 expressed in insect cells were able to phosphorylate IGFBP-3. TG2 kinase activity was inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion by calcium, which has previously been shown to be important for the cross-linking activity of TG2. These data provide compelling evidence that TG2 has intrinsic kinase activity, a function that has not previously been ascribed to TG2. Furthermore, we provide evidence that TG2 is a major component of the IGFBP-3 kinase activity present on breast cancer cell membranes.

IntroductionInsulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) 1The abbreviations used are: IGFBP-3, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3; MDC, monodansyl cadaverine. is the most abundant of the IGFBPs in the circulation. It is a multifunctional protein that not only transports insulin-like growth factors (IGF)-I and -II and modulates the actions of these growth factors but also has IGF-independent anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effects (1Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Google Scholar).IGFBP-3 can both enhance and inhibit the effects of IGF-I in vivo and in vitro depending upon experimental conditions (2DeMellow J.S.M. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 199-204Google Scholar, 3Valentinis B. Bhala A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. Cohen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 9: 361-367Google Scholar, 4Oh Y. Gucev Z. Ng L. Muller H.L. Rosenfeld R.G. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 6: 205-212Google Scholar, 5Lalou C. Lassarre C. Binoux M.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3206-3212Google Scholar, 6Hong J. Zhang G. Dong F. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10489-10497Google Scholar). Enhancement of IGF-I action may result from enhanced delivery of IGF-I to its plasma membrane receptor, whereas inhibition may be a consequence of competition between IGFBP-3 and the type 1 IGF receptor for binding of IGF-I (1Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Google Scholar, 2DeMellow J.S.M. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 199-204Google Scholar).In addition to these IGF-dependent effects, emerging evidence suggests that IGFBP-3 also functions directly to stimulate apoptosis and inhibit cellular proliferation of various cell lines, including human breast cancer cells (4Oh Y. Gucev Z. Ng L. Muller H.L. Rosenfeld R.G. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 6: 205-212Google Scholar). However, these IGF-independent effects are only apparent under conditions where the IGF-I-dependent effects are not observed, such as studies with mutant IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-3 fragments that have minimal affinity for IGF-I (5Lalou C. Lassarre C. Binoux M.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3206-3212Google Scholar, 6Hong J. Zhang G. Dong F. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10489-10497Google Scholar) and with cell lines devoid of IGF-I receptors (3Valentinis B. Bhala A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. Cohen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 9: 361-367Google Scholar).To further understand the mechanisms that allow for these opposing effects of IGFBP-3, we have investigated the interaction of IGFBP-3 with breast cancer cell membranes. In addition to proteolysis we have recently reported that IGFBP-3 is phosphorylated by breast cancer cells by a process that occurs on the cell membranes, does not require internalization, and is inhibited by IGF-I (7Mishra S. Murphy L.J. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4042-4050Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IGFBP-3 by this membrane-associated kinase enhanced the binding affinity of IGFBP-3 for IGF-I (7Mishra S. Murphy L.J. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4042-4050Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of IGFBP-3 at the membrane favors the interaction of IGF-I with IGFBP-3 rather than the IGF-I receptor. Furthermore, because formation of IGF-I·IGFBP-3 complexes inhibits binding of IGFBP-3 to the cell membrane, phosphorylation of IGFBP-3 may modulate its pro-apoptotic anti-proliferative effects. To further understand the role of this kinase in physiological regulation of IGFBP-3 action, we purified this kinase activity from T47D breast cancer cells. Here we report that this kinase activity is attributable to TG2.TG2 is a widely expressed enzyme that is involved in polymerization and aggregation of proteins via cross-linking glutamine residues. Although it contains a GTP binding domain and can hydrolyze both GTP and ATP (8Lai T.S. Slaughter T.F. Peoples K.A. Hettasch J.M. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1776-1781Google Scholar), it has not previously been reported to have kinase activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Reagents—T47D and MCF-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA). Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Glycosylated and non-glycosylated IGFBP-3 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Recombinant TG2 was purchased from Roboscreen. Guinea pig liver TG, the inhibitors cystamine and monodansyl cadaverine (MDC), biotinylated phospho-specific monoclonal antibodies, streptavidinhorseradish peroxidase conjugate and all other reagents, unless otherwise stated, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.Biotinylation of IGFBP-3—Non-glycosylated Escherichia coli-derived IGFBP-3 was biotinylated using p-biotinoyl-aminocaproic acid-N-hydroxy-succinamide ester (Roche Applied Science) as previously described (7Mishra S. Murphy L.J. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4042-4050Google Scholar).Purification of IGFBP-3 Kinase Activity—Solubilized T47D cell membranes were prepared using a membrane preparation kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions in the presence of protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). 3 ml of solubilized membranes was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter and loaded on a 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration column that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.5. The eluate was monitored for absorbance at 280 nm through a Pharmacia UV-1 single path monitor. 1-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and stored at –70 C. The activity was consistently found in fractions within molecular mass range of 65–85 kDa. A 20-μl aliquot of each fraction was assayed for IGFBP-3 kinase activities. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated with an Amicon Centricon 30 filter. A buffer-exchanged sample was passed through a High Q anion exchange column (Bio-Rad) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 0.05 m NaCl, 0.02% NaN3. Separation was performed in a linear gradient from 0.05–0.5 m NaCl over 50 min at flow rate of 1 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing kinase activity were concentrated using an Amicon Centricon filter and desalted. The buffer was exchanged using Micro Bio-Spin chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) and loaded onto an IGFBP-3-Sepharose 4B affinity column (2-ml bed volume). Bound proteins were first eluted with 0.05 m sodium phosphate containing 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2, followed by 0.1 m acetate buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, pH 4.0. Eluted fractions were desalted, concentrated, and used for IGFBP-3 kinase assay. A fraction with IGFBP-3 kinase activity was processed for liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy.For liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy analysis, 100 μl of desalted affinity fraction was digested with sequencing grade trypsin. The peptide mixture was lyophilized and resuspended in 10 μl of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and used for μHPLC-matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization quadrupole time-of-flight analysis. Chromatographic separation was performed using an Agilent 1100 Series system. Samples (5 μl) were injected into a 150 μm × 150 mm column (5μ, Vydac 218 TP C18) and eluted with 1–80% acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in 60 min. Major ion peaks of the total ion chromatogram were analyzed by mass spectrometry in a Manitoba/Sciex prototype quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. In this instrument, ions are produced by irradiation of the target using proton pulses from a 20-Hz nitrogen laser; the mass accuracy is within a few mDa in time-of-flight spectra. Identification of the tryptic peptides was done by data base searching against the peptide fingerprints using the Mascot search engine (www.matrixscience.com).Phosphorylation of IGFBP-3—Polystyrene tubes were coated with streptavidin and blocked with bovine serum albumin, washed in saline, and stored at –20 °C until used. Biotinylated IGFBP-3 (500 ng) was added in streptavidin-coated tubes for 2 h on ice. At the end of incubation, excess unbound IGFBP-3 was removed. Tubes were placed on ice, and a phosphorylation reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 10 mm Mg/ATP, 60 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP was added. Reaction was initiated by the addition of a membrane fraction and allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C. Reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 7–10 min, and analyzed on 11% gel. Subsequently, gels were dried and processed for autoradiography. In some cases two microunits of guinea pig liver TG2 or histidinetagged full-length human TG2 expressed using the baculovirus expression system in insect cells and purified by nickel(II)-nitroacetate-agarose chromatography was used to phosphorylate IGFBP-3 in the presence or absence of TG2-specific inhibitors. To determine the stoichiometry of IGFBP-3 phosphorylation, the reaction was carried out in a final volume of 500 μl containing 10 μg of substrate and 5 μg of transglutaminase. Aliquots were removed at various time points, mixed with sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Phosphorylated proteins was separated on SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Bands corresponding to phosphorylated IGFBP-3 were excised and their radioactivity measured. Kinetic parameters were determined by linear regression analysis. For the Lineweaver-Burk plot, phosphate was incorporated into IGFBP-3 incubated at various concentrations in the presence of 0.25 μg of transglutaminase for 15 min. In experiments where cell monolayers were used to phosphorylate IGFBP-3, cells were grown in 24-well culture plates to near confluence and washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove residual medium and serum. Phosphorylation was then performed in 100 μl of reaction mixture as above, containing 1 μg of IGFBP-3 for 10 min at 37 °C. At the end of incubation, the reaction mixture was aspirated, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of sample buffer and analyzed on 11% gel. In some experiments cell monolayers were treated with TG2 inhibitor for 30 min prior to the phosphorylation reaction.Investigation of Phosphorylation Sites in IGFBP-3—The potential phosphorylation sites in IGFBP-3 were identified by the NetPhos 2.0 program (www.cds.dtu.dk/Services/NetPhos) under low stringency conditions and by the Scansite program (scansite.mit.edu) using medium stringency conditions. For determination of serine-, threonine-, and tyrosine-specific phosphorylation within the IGFBP-3 molecule, intact IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-3 synthetic peptides (107–138 and 152–181) were phosphorylated using recombinant TG2. Phosphorylated proteins and peptides were separated on 14% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with biotinylated-phospho-specific monoclonal antibodies (dilution 1:8000; Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, membranes were incubated with streptavidinhorseradish peroxidase conjugate (dilution 1:40,000) for 1 h at room temperature and detected using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoprecipitation—10 μl of anti-TG2 goat polyclonal antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology) was added to 200 μl of solubilized membranes from T47D or MCF-7 cells and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. 20 μl of Protein A-agarose (Pierce) was added and further incubated on a rotating device overnight at 4 °C. At the end of incubation the pellet was washed four times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer. 10 μl of the resuspended sample was used for phosphorylation of 500 ng of IGFBP-3. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and immunoblotting with TG2 antiserum.Western Blotting—Various column fractions that had IGFBP-3 kinase activity were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk, incubated with TG2 antiserum diluted to 1:1000, washed three times (5 min each) in TBST (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0), and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) secondary antibody (1:3000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times in TBST and subsequently analyzed with ECL.RESULTSPurification of IGFBP-3 Kinase Activity from T47D Cell Membranes—The IGFBP-3 kinase activity was purified from solubilized T47D cell membranes using immobilized biotinylated IGFBP-3 as a substrate. A three-step procedure was used involving gel permeation, ion exchange, and IGFBP-3 affinity chromatography (Fig. 1). Fractions eluted from the IGFBP-3 affinity column under acidic conditions that contained IGFBP-3 kinase activity were further analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectroscopy. Using the Mascot search engine a variety of proteins were identified that had significant scores (Table I). Of these, TG2 had the highest score, and there was wide coverage over the entire TG2 molecule with peptides from various regions of the molecule identified. Tandem mass spectroscopy was used to confirm the sequence of various peptide fragments (Table II).Table IProteins whose tryptic peptide fragments were identified by HPLC/tandem mass spectroscopy in IGFBP-3 affinity column fraction containing kinase activityProteinScoreaScore determined as -10Log(P), where P is the probability that the observed match is a random event.

Immunoreactive TG2 was present in all three samples (Fig. 1C). ROCK2 was also detectable in T47D cell membrane fractions.We assessed the effect of the TG2 and ROCK2 inhibitors on phosphorylation of IGFBP-3 by cell monolayers. We have previously shown that intact washed cells were able to phosphorylate IGFBP-3 immobilized on polystyrene tubes (7Mishra S. Murphy L.J. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4042-4050Google Scholar). T47D cell monolayers were incubated for 30 min in the presence of various concentrations of cystamine, an inhibitor of TG2. The washed cell monolayers were incubated with IGFBP-3 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 37 °C. After termination of the incubation, the IGFBP-3 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 2A). Inhibition was seen with as little as 20 μm, and complete inhibition was apparent with 50 μm of cystamine. Because TG2 has been found in association with ROCK2, a Rho-kinase (9Singh U.S. Kunar M.T. Kao Y-L. Baker K.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2413-2423Google Scholar), and ROCK2 was present in the affinity-purified cell membrane fractions, we also investigated the effect of the ROCK2 inhibitor, R-(+)trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1aminoethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide dihydrochloride. The ROCK2 inhibitor had no effect on IGFBP-3 phosphorylation. Similar experiments were undertaken utilizing membrane preparations from both T47D and MCF-7 cells. As reported previously, both T47D and MCF-7 cells were able to phosphorylate IGFBP-3. This process was inhibited by cystamine and MDC in both cells lines (Fig. 2B). Me2SO, the vehicle in which MDC was dissolved, had no effect. The ROCK2 inhibitor had no effect on IGFBP-3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2The effect of TG2 and ROCK2 inhibitors on phosphorylation of IGFBP-3 by breast cancer cell monolayers (A) or cell membranes (B and C). A, various concentrations of cystamine or the ROCK2 inhibitor R-(+)trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1aminoethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide dihydrochloride were preincubated with T47D cell monolayers prior to determining the ability of the cell monolayer to phosphorylate IGFBP-3. B, cystamine (20 μm), monodansyl cadaverine (MDC, 200 μm), or the vehicle Me2SO (DMSO) (0.005%) was added to MCF-7 and T47D cell membranes, and the ability of these membranes to phosphorylate IGFBP-3 was determined. C, the ability of cystamine (10 and 20 μm) and the ROCK2 inhibitor R-(+)trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1aminoethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide dihydrochloride (2 and 5 μm) to inhibit phosphorylation of IGFBP-3 by affinity-purified T47D cell membranes was compared.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next examined the effect of TG2 and ROCK2 antisera on IGFBP-3 kinase activity present in cell membrane preparations. Antiserum against TG2, but not ROCK2 antiserum, was able to immunodeplete IGFBP-3 kinase activity from membrane preparations (Fig. 3A). When the immunoprecipitates were analyzed for kinase activity, the precipitates obtained with TG2 antiserum, but not those obtained with ROCK2 antiserum, had kinase activity. Furthermore, the IGFBP-3 kinase activity present in the immunoprecipitates was inhibited by cystamine but not by the ROCK2 inhibitor (Fig. 3C).Fig. 3Immunodepletion and immunoprecipitation of IGFBP-3 kinase activity from T47D solubilized membranes. A, solubilized T47D cell membranes were incubated with antibodies to TG2 or ROCK2. After the immunoprecipitates were pelleted using protein A-agarose, the supernatants were tested for the ability to phosphorylate IGFBP-3. B, TG2 and ROCK2 were immunoprecipitated from solubilized MCF-7 or T47D cell membranes and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. To demonstrate the presence of these two proteins in the immunoprecipitates, the membrane was immunoblotted with anti-TG2 or anti-ROCK2 antibodies. C, the presence of IGFBP-3 kinase activity in the anti-TG2 immunoprecipitates was demonstrated, and ability of cystamine (20 μm) and the ROCK2 inhibitor (5 μm) to inhibit this kinase activity was assessed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Purified guinea pig liver TG2 and human recombinant TG2 both were able to phosphorylate IGFBP-3 (Fig. 4A). This process was inhibited by cystamine and MDC. The related binding protein IGFBP-5 was also phosphorylated by TG2, whereas IGFBP-1 was not phosphorylated by TG2 (Fig. 4B). Consistent with a previous report (10Sakai K. Busby Jr., W.H. Clarke J.B. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8740-8745Google Scholar), an increase in the molecular mass of IGFBP-1 was observed, suggesting that TG2 can polymerase IGFBP-1 (data not shown). Fibronectin, another reported substrate for TG2 (11Akimov S.S. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2989-3000Google Scholar), was not phosphorylated by this enzyme under the conditions we used to phosphorylate IGFBP-3 (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Purified guinea pig (gp) liver TG2 and recombinant human TG2 have IGFBP-3 kinase activity. A, the effect of cystamine (cyst, 20 μm) and MDC (200 μm) on the IGFBP-3 kinase activity of guinea pig and recombinant TG2 was examined and compared with controls (cont.) or vehicle only (Me2SO, DMSO, 0.005%). B, the ability of recombinant human TG2 to phosphorylate IGFBP-1, IGFBP-5, fibronectin, and fibronectin fragments was investigated. C, the effect of increasing calcium concentration on human recombinant TG2 kinase activity and cross-linking activity was investigated. An autoradiogram demonstrating the effect of increasing calcium concentration on TG2 kinase activity is shown (left panel). In the control lane, (cont.), IGFBP-3 in the absence of TG2 and [γ-32P]ATP was loaded. In the right panel the same blot has been immunoblotted with anti-IGFBP-3 antibody. The arrows indicate the positions of polymerized (poly) and monomeric (mono) IGFBP-3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because calcium is necessary for the cross-linking activity of TG2 (12Kang S.K. Kim D.K. Damron D.S. Baek K.J. Im M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 383-390Google Scholar), we examined the effect of increasing concentrations of calcium on the kinase activity of TG2. As the calcium concentration was increased we observed a decrease in the ability of TG2 to phosphorylate IGFBP-3 (Fig. 4C, left panel). Concomitantly, there was an increase in polymerization of IGFBP-3 observed (Fig. 4C, right panel). Polymerized IGFBP-3 was only lightly phosphorylated compared with monomer IGFBP-3 (Fig. 4C, left panel).The stoichiometry of phosphorylation of IGFBP-3 by TG2 was next examined (Fig. 5). Under maximal conditions ∼2.5 pmols of 32P was incorporated per pmol of IGFBP-3, indicating the presence of at least three potential TG2 phosphorylation sites in IGFBP-3. The Km and Vmax for the TG2 phosphorylation reaction was 13.2 ± 1.2 μm and 5.2 pmol/min/μg of IGFBP-3, respectively.Fig. 5The stoichiometry and kinetics of phosphorylation of IGFBP-3 by TG2. TG2 phosphorylation of IGFBP-3 was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots were removed at various time points. For the Lineweaver-Burk plot, phosphate was incorporated into IGFBP-3 incubated at various concentrations in the presence of 0.25 μg of transglutaminase for 15 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Immunoblotting of TG2-phosphorylated IGFBP-3 with antiphospho-amino acid-specific antibodies yields a strong reaction with anti-phosphoserine antibody (Fig. 6), a weak reaction with anti-phosphothreonine, and no reaction with anti-phosphotyrosine (data not shown). Using NetPhos 2.O under low stringency a total of 15 serine and 5 threonine residues were identified (Table III). Of these, 13 serine and 2 threonine resided in the central domain, residues 107–181. Using Scansite software at medium stringency only four potential phosphorylation sites were identified, serine 121, serine 156, threonine 170, and threonine 181. Two peptides were generated corresponding to residues 107–138 (peptide 1) and residues 152–181 (peptide 2) and covering the two clusters of potential phosphorylation sites. These two peptides included all potential phosphorylation sites with the exception of resides serine 70, threonine 181 (blocked in peptide 2), threonine 193, serine 227, and threonine 249 and 250. Both peptides were phosphorylated by TG2, and densitometric analysis of autoradiographs indicated that peptide 1 accounted for 44.2 ± 1.17% of the phosphorylation of IGFBP-3, whereas peptide 2 accounted for 40.3 ± 3.3%. Both peptides were recognized by an anti-phosphoserine-specific antibody (Fig. 6). Peptide 2, corresponding to residues 152 to 181, was also recognized by an anti-phosphothreonine antibody. Because threonine 181 is blocked and threonine 130 in peptide 1 is apparently not phosphorylated, most likely threonine 170, predicted by Scansite software, is phosphorylated.Fig. 6Phosphorylation of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-3 peptides by TG2. Equimolar amounts of IGFBP-3 or IGFBP-3 peptides 1 and 2 were phosphorylated with TG2 and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted with either anti-phosphoserine or antiphosphothreonine antibodies.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONAnalysis of purified fractions from breast cancer cells containing IGFBP-3 kinase activity identified a number of potentially interesting proteins. Of these only ROCK2 was previously known to have kinase activity, and we assumed that this was responsible for phosphorylation of IGFBP-3. However, a specific inhibitor of ROCK2 kinase activity had no effect on the IGFBP-3 kinase activity of breast cancer cell monolayers or purified membrane preparations. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of ROCK2 from membrane preparation did not deplete the IGFBP-3 kinase activity, whereas this activity could be completely removed by immunoprecipitation with TG2 antiserum and blocked by TG2 inhibitors. These data, together with the demonstration that both guinea pig liver TG2 and recombinant human TG2 could phosphorylate IGFBP-3, provided convincing evidence that TG2 can function as an ectokinase in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, it appears to account for virtually all the IGFBP-3 kinase activity present on the membrane of these cells because very little residual activity was apparent after immunoprecipitation of TG2 from breast cancer membrane preparations. We have previously shown that IGFBP-3 can also be phosphorylated by an ectokinase p"

Addition of A23187 caused a fast rise of cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c), which returned close to the resting level within about 40 s. The [Ca2+]c rise was immediately followed by phospholipid hydrolysis, which could be inhibited by aristolochic acid or by pretreatment with thapsigargin in Ca2+-free medium, indicating that the Ca2+-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) was involved. These early events were followed by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) and by apoptosis in about 30% of the cell population. In keeping with a cause-effect relationship between addition of A23187, activation of cPLA2, PTP opening, and cell death, all events but the [Ca2+]c rise were prevented by aristolochic acid. The number of cells killed by A23187 was doubled by treatment with 0.5 μm MK886 and 5 μm indomethacin, which inhibit arachidonic acid metabolism through the 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathway, respectively. Consistent with the key role of free arachidonic acid, its levels increased within minutes of treatment with A23187; the increase being more pronounced in the presence of MK886 plus indomethacin. Cell death was preceded by cytochrome c release and cleavage of caspase 9 and 3, but not of caspase 8. All these events were prevented by aristolochic acid and by the PTP inhibitor cyclosporin A. Thus, A23187 triggers the apoptotic cascade through the release of arachidonic acid by cPLA2 in a process that is amplified when transformation of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins and leukotrienes is inhibited.

The results are discussed in light of contemporary theories of aging in animals. Endogenously generated reactive oxygen species, produced by the electron transport chains, react with different macromolecules in the cell and cause oxidative damage. Such oxidative damage accumulates over time during the life cycle of many organisms and has been suggested to be one possible cause of aging (1Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar, 2Sohal R.S. Agarwal S. Dubey A. Orr W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7255-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Protein carbonylation is a widely used marker of protein oxidation, and sensitive methods for its detection have been developed by Stadtman and Levine (3Levine R.L. Garland D. Oliver C.N. Amici A.

Direct oxidative attack on Lys, Arg, Pro, and Thr or by secondary reactions via reactive carbohydrates and lipids on Cys, His, and Lys residues can lead to the formation of protein carbonyl derivatives (4Pantke U.

In rats, aged flies, and senescing yeast and bacteria, this oxidation has been shown to be specific and targets enzymes of the Krebs cycle and other proteins, including stress proteins, Hsp70 chaperones, and translation elongation factors (7Dukan S.

In contrast, little is known about the occurrence of and targets for protein oxidation during the life cycle of annual plants. The annual model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has a life cycle from seed to seed of about 6 weeks under optimal growth conditions. After germination, the above ground portion of the Arabidopsis plant initially develops two cotyledons and later a compressed rosette of leaves. All structures originate from the apical shoot meristem (11Clark S.E. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Kerstetter R.A. Hake S. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Later the shoot apical meristem will undergo a transition to an inflorescence meristem. Under long day conditions this occurs when the plant has six to ten leaves, although this varies with the genetic background and the environmental conditions. Somewhat later, after the main stem has elongated and produced a complex of higher order branches, a transition to a flower meristem occurs, from which the reproductive organs develop. After fertilization and as the seeds mature, the somatic tissues of the whole plant become increasingly senescent. Leaf senescence is the final stage of leaf development that ultimately results in the death of the plant (reviewed in Ref. 13Bleecker A.B. Patterson S.E. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). During this final stage, the leaf cells undergo a programmed cell death process, referred to as the senescence syndrome (14Nooden L.D. Nooden L.D. Leopold A.C. Senescene and Aging in Plants. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1988: 1-50Google Scholar). The most widely used biomarker for the senescence syndrome is the loss of chlorophyll associated with the degeneration of chloroplast internal structures (15Thomson W.W. Plat-Aloia K.A. Thomson W.W. Nothnagel E.A. Huffaker R.C. Plant Senescence: Its Biochemistry and Physiology. American Society of Plant Physiologists, Rockville, MD1987: 20-30Google Scholar). Leaf senescence is an intrinsic age-dependent process and its onset appears to be regulated by the age of individual leaves (16Hensel L.L. Grbic V. Baumgarten D.A. Bleecker A.B. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 553-564PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that the quantitative and qualitative pattern of carbonylation during progression through the life cycle of the plant A. thaliana is distinct from that of the yeast, fly, nematode, and mammalian model systems. Carbonylation first increases with the age of the plant, similar to animals and microbes, but drops abruptly prior to the vegetative to reproductive transition and does not coincide with leaf senescence. Proteomic identification of the major targets for protein carbonylation in the plant leaves indicates that proteins directly and indirectly linked to chloroplast activities exhibit special problems with respect to oxidative damage. The data highlight that there is no inevitable, stochastic, increase in protein oxidation in aging tissues of the plant A. thaliana. Culturing Conditions—Wild-type A. thaliana plants (ecotype Col-0) were grown on a mixture of 2:1:1 of soil:vermiculite:perlite in a greenhouse in a day/night temperature regime of 22/18 °C, an 18-h photoperiod, a photon flux density of 125 μmol m-2 s-1, and a relative humidity of 70%. Plants were watered twice a week with a nutrition solution as described (17Somerville C. Ogren W.L. Edelman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.H. Methods in Chloroplast Biology. Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1982: 129-138Google Scholar). Isolation of Cellular Proteins—Protein extractions and chlorophyll measurements were from leaf number 5 and 6, unless the extractions were from very young plants in which case the whole seedlings were used. Rosette leaves from different life stages were grinded in liquid N2 using a precooled mortar and pestle. The powder was resuspended in a buffer containing 250 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2% lithium dodecyl sulfate, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm pefabloc (protease inhibitor, Roche Applied Science). The sample was heated for 5 min at 75 °C. Tubes were cooled and centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and the protein was acetone-extracted by addition of acetone to a final concentration of 80% (v/v) at -20 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged for 20,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. After centrifugation and vacuum drying, the protein pellet was resuspended in the same buffer as above and stored at -20 °C after the protein concentration had been determined. The concentration of proteins was estimated using Pierce BCA protein quantification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The relative abundance of Rubisco 1The abbreviations used are: Rubisco, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone; DNPH, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. was determined using specific antibodies (from Agrisera, Vännäs, Sweden) and Western blotting. As a secondary antibody, anti-chicken IgG from Sigma (product number A9046) was used. Carbonylation Assays—Detection of carbonylated proteins was performed using the chemical and immunological reagents of the OxyBlot™ Oxidized Protein Detection Kit (Intergen). The carbonyl groups in the protein side chains were derivatized to 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (DNP) by reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH). The chemiluminescence blotting substrate (ECLplus) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences and used according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Immobilon-P polyvinylidene diflouride membrane was from Millipore Corp. As described above, crude protein extracts were obtained during the different life stages of the plant, the extracts were reacted with the carbonyl reagent, DNPH, dot-blotted onto polyvinylidene diflouride membranes, and oxidatively modified proteins were detected with anti-DNP antibodies. In general, 5 μg of protein were loaded into the slot-blot apparatus and 50 μg onto two-dimensional gels. Isolation of Mitochondria—All steps included in mitochondrial isolations were performed at 4 °C. Leaves (or whole seedlings) were harvested and immediately prepared. 5–10 g w/w was homogenized in 50 ml of grinding medium (0.3 m sucrose, 25 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm KH2PO4, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm ascorbic acid, pH 7.2) using a chilled mortar and pestle. The homogenate was filtered through a single layer of damp, chilled, fine filter cloth and centrifuged at 4500 rpm (Beckmann JA-21 centrifuge, JA-20 rotor, ∼3000 × g) at 4 °C for 5 min. Supernatants were kept and centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 rpm (∼17,000 × g). Pellets were collected and resuspended in a small volume of wash buffer (0.15 M sucrose, 10 mm TES, and 0.05% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2) using a soft, small brush. The solution was combined into two tubes, which were filled up with wash buffer, and two centrifugation steps, as described above, were performed. Pellets containing the mitochondria were resuspended in a small volume of wash buffer and layered on top of a step Percoll gradient (gradient solution consisting of 0.75 m sucrose, 25 mm MOPS, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2) at 21, 29, and 60%. The gradient was centrifuged for 40 min at 18 000 rpm (∼40,000 × g). The interface of the heaviest and the middle gradient densities contained the mitochondria. The band was collected by aspiration with a 1-ml pipetteman and diluted with wash buffer in a chilled 15-ml corex tube. This tube was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm (∼27,000 × g). Pellets were resuspended in wash buffer and centrifuged once as described above. The pellet containing the purified mitochondria was resuspended in a small volume of wash buffer. The protein content was quantified after acetone precipitation. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Protein extracts were prepared and run on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels by the methods of O'Farrell (18O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications (7Dukan S. Nystrom T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Ampholines with a pH range of 3.5–10 from Amersham Biosciences AB were used. Gel electrophoresis was carried out using 11.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue or immunoblotted according to standard procedures. Signal intensities in gels and blots were analyzed by the computer program PDQuest (Bio-Rad). This program detects the chemiluminescence signal contributed by each separate protein spot and divides it by the total chemiluminescence signal of the whole blot. The program also detects the intensity of the Coomassie spot contributed by each protein spot and divides it with the intensity of the total Coomassie intensity of the whole gel. By making a ratio of these parameters a relative measurement of carbonylation/amount of protein can be calculated (the oxidation index). Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight data were acquired on an [email protected] (Micromass, Manchester, UK) in reflectron mode and ESI data in mass spectrometry and mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry mode on a Q-Tof Ultima (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Protein identifications were done using MASCOT (available at www.matrixscience.com). Proteins were identified against the nr protein data base at NCBI, where a score of 74 corresponds to a 95% confidence level. All proteins were identified with scores above 95. Protein Oxidation Is Age-dependent—A. thaliana plants (ecotype Col-0) were grown in a photoperiod of 18 h of light and 6 h of darkness, and protein extractions were made from different life cycle stages, ranging from before bolting to 25% leaf senescence. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, protein carbonyl levels per total protein first increases as the rosette leaves becomes chronologically older. However, this increase is followed by an abrupt decrease in oxidation levels around 20 days after planting. The carbonylation levels in the last stages of the life cycle of the plant did not change (not shown). To evaluate whether there was any difference in carbonylation status during the photoperiod (day) and the period of active mitochondrial respiration (night), total cellular protein was extracted from plants, either 4 h after the light was switched on or 5 h after the light was switched off. The carbonyl signal from these two conditions was quantified and demonstrated the same trend in terms of the kinetics of protein oxidation during the plant life cycle (Fig. 1B). The growth conditions used resulted in bolting between 23 and 26 days after planting. In parallel to carbonylation measurements, chlorophyll content was analyzed, which demonstrated that the drastic drop in protein carbonyl levels occurred prior to the loss of chlorophyll that occurs during leaf senescence. (Fig. 1, B and C). Chloroplast Proteins Are Major Targets for Protein Carbonylation—Protein carbonylation does not occur at random and is targeted to specific proteins in senescing and oxidatively stressed organisms (7Dukan S. Nystrom T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 19Dukan S. Nystrom T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26027-26032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To investigate whether protein oxidation is specific also in A. thaliana, we utilized a proteomic immunochemical approach to identify possible targets for protein carbonylation in aging leafs. We used the method described by O‘Farrell (18O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the modifications described under “Experimental Procedures.” We analyzed the spectrum of carbonylated proteins in samples taken from plants during the day (light) period and night (dark) period. The most prominent carbonylated proteins of the aged (20 days) rosette leaves, e.g. Rubisco large subunit, Rubisco-activase, the β-subunit of ATP synthase, OEC33, and chlorophyll a/b-binding protein, are all residing in the chloroplast (Fig. 2A and Table I. Among these, all, except the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein, were carbonylated both during the day and night (Table I). It is possible that the carbonylated Hsp70 chaperone identified also resides in the chloroplast, but the mass spectrometry data did not allow us to firmly distinguish between the different Hsp70s. A. thaliana has 14 members of the Hsp70 family (20Sung D.Y. Vierling E. Guy C.L. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), targeted to different subcellular locations. They all share a very high degree of conservation, and therefore it was not clear which specific Hsp70 protein of the family was carbonylated. The identified carbonylated proteins of the chloroplasts are abundant plant proteins, but it is clear that many equally abundant proteins, such as the α-subunit of the ATP synthase or the small subunit of Rubisco, did not show any signs of being carbonylated. Thus, like in other model systems, carbonylation appear to be specific in the plant A. thaliana.Table IIdentities of the most carbonylated proteins of A. thaliana Protein from total cell extract was derivatized and run on two-dimensional gels. The gels were blotted to membranes, and the most carbonylated proteins were detected with antibodies. The corresponding Coomassie spots were cut out and subjected to mass spectrometry.Protein carbonylatedConditionSource, NCBI gi no.DayNightHsp70YesYesSeveral hitsRubisco-large subunitYesYes7525041β-Subunit of chloroplast ATPaseYesYes755040Rubisco-activase splice form 1YesYes7438143Rubisco-activase splice form 2YesYes7438144OEC, 33 kDaYesYes15230324Chlorophyll a/b-binding proteinNoYesSeveral hits Open table in a new tab Since Rubisco is a very abundant protein in the plant cell, it is possible that the total carbonylation signal obtained (Fig. 1B) simply follows age-dependent alterations in the abundance of Rubisco itself. However, this does not seem to be the case. Western blot analysis, using a specific antibody against Rubisco (Fig. 1C), demonstrated that Rubisco concentrations stay more or less constant during the time when carbonylation first increased gradually and subsequently dropped abruptly. In other words, the precipitous fall in protein carbonyl levels must be due to a specific reduction in the levels of oxidized proteins rather than an overall loss of Rubisco, for example, associated with the senescence syndrome. Carbonylation of Mitochondrial Proteins Is Specific—The relative abundance of some carbonylated proteins of the chloroplasts makes it difficult to detect carbonyl signals from other radical oxygen species-generating organelles, such as the mitochondria, in the crude cell extracts. Thus, to identify the most carbonylated proteins in the mitochondria, we isolated pure mitochondria from plants after 21 days of growth and applied immunochemical proteomics as described above. We found that the major targets for carbonylation in the mitochondria are glycine dehydrogenase (glycine cleavage system P-protein), a P-protein-like protein, the β-subunit of the ATP synthase, a glycine hydroxymethyltransferase-like protein, and aminomethyltransferase (glycine cleavage system T-protein) (Table II). Like in chloroplasts, some very abundant mitochondrial proteins, e.g. the mitochondrial F1 ATP synthase α-subunit, citrate synthase, and malate dehydrogenase, did not show any signs of carbonylation suggesting that carbonylation sensitivity is specific also in this organelle.Table IIIdentities of the most carbonylated proteins of the mitochondria Protein from isolated mitochondria was derivatized and run on two-dimensional gels. The gels were blotted to membranes, and the most carbonylated proteins were detected with antibodies. The corresponding Coomassie spots were cut out and subjected to mass spectrometry.Protein carbonylatedSourceNCBI gi no.Swissprot no.Glycine dehydrogenase (glycine cleavage system P-protein)O80988P-protein-like protein14596025Mitochondroial F1 ATP synthase β-subunit17939849Glycine hydroxymethyltransferase-like protein15235745Aminomethyltransferase (glycine cleavage system T-protein)O65396 Open table in a new tab Since targets for carbonylation have not been thoroughly examined in plants, many of the carbonylated proteins identified here denote new proteins on the list of oxidation-sensitive proteins. However, heat shock Hsp70 chaperones and F-type ATP synthases have been shown previously to be sensitive to oxidative attack both in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (7Dukan S. Nystrom T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 8Cabiscol E. Piulats E. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27393-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the other oxidized proteins of the chloroplast highlights key processes that appear to be targets for oxidative modification: specifically (i) photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and photorespiratory carbon oxidation (Rubisco, rubisco-activase), (ii) light-induced water oxidation at photosystem II (OEC33), and (iii) light harvesting and energy transfer at photochemical reaction centers (chlorophyll a/b-binding protein). Rubisco catalyzes the first step in net photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and photorespiratory carbon oxidation. The active site of Rubisco assumes a closed conformation with certain phosphorylated ligands, and in the absence of catalysis, conversion of Rubisco from the closed to the open conformation is extremely slow. Rubisco-activase facilitates this process by releasing the inhibitory sugar phosphates (reviwed in Refs. 21Portis Jr., A.R. J. Exp. Bot. 1995; 46: 1285-1291Crossref Google Scholar and 22Salvucci M.E. Ogren W.L. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 47: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Rubisco-activase is an ATP-dependent AAA+ protein (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities), which includes a variety of proteins with chaperone-like functions (23Neuwald A. Aravind L. Spouge J. Koonin E. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rubisco-activase is present in two isoforms (24Salvucci M.E. Werneke J.M. Ogren W.L. Portis Jr., A.R. Plant Physiol. 1987; 84: 930-936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), differing only at the carboxyl terminus, which arise by alternative splicing of the gene transcript (25Werneke J.M. Chatfield J.M. Ogren W.L. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The longer form is subjected to redox regulation via thioredoxin-f-mediated reduction of a pair of cysteine residues in the COOH-terminal extension (26Zhang N. Portis Jr., A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9438-9443Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Based on pI, molecular mass, abundance, and mass spectrometry data, we concluded that both forms of the activase are carbonylated, but the longer form (activase I; Fig. 2A) is significantly more oxidized. This is also supported by the oxidation index calculated by the computer program PDQuest (Fig. 2B). The OEC33 protein, together with OEC24 and OEC18, bind to the core of photosystem II at the lumenal surface to regulate the water oxidation process. Photosystem II is susceptible to damage caused by excess light, and the D1 protein of this system is a specific target for such photodamage. When damaged, D1 is rapidly degraded, and it has been suggested that OEC33 stimulates this degradation (27Yamamoto Y. Ishikawa Y. Nakatani E. Yamada M. Zhang H. Wydrzynski T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to elucidate whether the carbonylation of OEC33 affects D1 proteolysis and whether oxidation of OEC33 is, itself, a direct consequence of photodamage. Light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding (Lhc) proteins are associated with the photosystems where they absorb energy through chlorophyll excitation and transfer the energy to photochemical reaction centers. In the case of higher plants, several reports have shown that the mRNA levels of cab transcripts fluctuate diurnally (reviewed in Ref. 28Millar A.J. Kay S.A. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 541-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with cab mRNA levels peaking in the late morning and reaching a minimum in the late evening. Interestingly, the carbonylation of this protein also fluctuated such that oxidation was mainly observed during the night (Table I). All of the proteins identified as carbonylated from the mitochondrial fraction (except for the β-subunit of the ATP synthase) play roles in the C2 oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle. Besides its carboxylse activity Rubisco has oxygenase activity, and therefore some ribulose-bisphosphate is converted to 2-phosphoglycolate, a compound that cannot be utilized by the Calvin cycle. 2-Phosphoglycolate is therefore salvaged by the C2 oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle. In this process, two molecules of glyoxylate are joined to form glycine. Glycine moves into the mitochondrion and becomes oxidatively decarboxylated by the glycine decarboxylase complex. As shown here, several components of this complex are modified by carbonylation. This is in line with the data of Taylor et al. (29Taylor N.L. Day D.A. Millar A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42663-42668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) demonstrating that glycine decarboxylase activities in peas are exquisitely sensitive to oxidative stress. The “stochastic” as opposed to “programmed” view of aging states that aging results from random deleterious events, and oxidative damage has been suggested to be a major contributor to such stochastic degeneration of cells and organisms. It has been demonstrated that the levels of carbonylated proteins increase with age in a large variety of species, including mammals, nematodes, and flies, and that such oxidative modification plays havoc with the catalytic activity and structural integrity of the target proteins (2Sohal R.S. Agarwal S. Dubey A. Orr W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7255-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 3Levine R.L. Garland D. Oliver C.N. Amici A. Climent I. Lenz A.G. Ahn B.W.

The hypothesis is supported by experimental data demonstrating that the life span of fruitflies, for example, can be prolonged by overproducing antioxidants and that alleles that retard aging in yeast, flies, worms, and mice often boost the defense of the organism against oxidative damage (30Sun J. Tower J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 31Feng J. Bussiere F. Hekimi S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) In plants, the concept of an individual, and therefore aging, is ambiguous. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that determine the life span of whole plants are obviously amenable to scientific examination and hypotheses aimed to explain plant longevity states that plant aging may be linked to resource allocation and competition between old and young tissues (e.g. Ref. 32Thomas H. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Specifically, it has been argued that older leaves are outcompeted by young tissues for “anti-aging” hormones (33Nooden L.D. Letham D.S. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 20: 639-653Google Scholar), such as cytokinins (34Hwang I. Sheen J. Nature. 2001; 413: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). A variation on this theme is that young tissues seek to satisfy their demand for resources by exporting “death hormones” to older cells/tissues (35Wilson J. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 99: 511-516Crossref Google Scholar), and ethylene exhibits some characteristics of such hypothetical senescencepromoting substances (36Jing H.C. Sturre M.J. Hille J. Dijkwel P.P. Plant J. 2002; 32: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These theories are, in part, analogous to some evolutionary models of senescence in animals, which propose that there is a trade-off, or antagonism, between reproduction activities and cellular maintenance and repair (37Kirkwood T.B. Nature. 1977; 270: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar, 38Williams G. Evolution. 1957; 11: 398-411Crossref Google Scholar). As an inevitable consequence, an optimal life history entails an imperfect ability of the soma to resist intrinsic stress, such as oxidative damage. With the above-mentioned theories in mind, we argued that old tissues, e.g. leaves, of an annual plant might loose their ability to defend themselves against intrinsically generated oxidative damage during transition to reproductive development. The results obtained did not support this notion. Instead, we found that old leaves rid themselves of oxidized proteins prior to bolting and flower development. At first glance, this suggests that the progression of oxidative damage in the life cycle of animals and plants is fundamentally different. Indeed, it clearly demonstrates that increased protein oxidation is not universally and inevitably related to the age of a biological tissue. However, one aspect of protein oxidation is similar in animals and plants, that is, production of offspring occurs at a time at which the overall oxidative damage in the organism is low. In animals this coincides with the early to middle stages of the life cycle of the organism, whereas in A. thaliana, it signifies the end point of its developmental progression. This begs the question of the physiological significance of the drastic drop in protein oxidation preceding flower development and to what extent this may affect the fitness of the offspring. In addition, it would be of interest to identify the temporal and molecular nature of the signals triggering the removal of damaged proteins and whether the elimination of such damage is a prerequisite for the transition to flowering.

Hence, the two soluble proteins from mollusks, which can be studied by a variety of physical methods, become discrete surrogate proteins for the extracellular domains of distinct subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are prototype molecules for the large superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (1Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Google Scholar, 2Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Google Scholar, 3Sixma T.K. Smit A.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 311-334Google Scholar). Due to their abundance in the electric organs of Torpedo sp. and the finding that peptide toxins from elapid venoms bind with high affinity to the receptor (4Chang C.C. Lee C.Y. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. 1963; 144: 241-257Google Scholar, 5Lee C.Y. Showa Igakkai Zasshi. 1963; 23: 221-229Google Scholar), the acetylcholine receptor became the first neurotransmitter receptor to be characterized as a molecular entity (6Changeux J.P. Kasai M. Lee C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1241-1247Google Scholar). The receptor from Torpedo, similar to the receptor found in skeletal muscle throughout the fish and mammal phyla, assembles as a pentamer composed of four distinct subunits with only one of the subunits being expressed as two copies. The two binding sites, which in the muscle receptor are not identical in recognition characteristics, reside at the interface of the α and its partnering subunits. At least 12 nicotinic receptor subunits from mammalian neuronal tissues have been isolated, and they assemble in selected permutations of α and β subtypes. The simplest subtypes structurally are the homomeric pentamers of α subunits such as those from the α7 subtype (1Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Google Scholar, 7Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Google Scholar). To function as gated channels, the receptor protein must span the membrane multiple times. The four transmembrane spans on each of the five subunits create a substantial region of hydrophobicity that precludes facile crystallization of this protein. Recent electron microscopy reconstruction analysis has led to a structure of the transmembrane region resolved to 4 Å and a description of the extracellular domain at somewhat lower resolution (8Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Google Scholar). An additional specialization of nature has led investigators to a high resolution structure of the extracellular domain of the receptor. The fresh water snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, produces a soluble protein, termed the acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) 1The abbreviations used are: AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; A-AChBP, Aplysia acetylcholine-binding protein; L-AChBP, Lymnaea acetylcholine-binding protein; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. that binds acetylcholine (9Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Characterization of its ligand recognition characteristics shows similar ligand specificity to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (10Smit A.B. Syed N.I. Schaap D. van Minnen J. Klumperman J.

Deerinck T. Tsigelny I. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41299-41302Google Scholar). The Lymnaea binding protein is also pentameric and is composed of identical subunits, most closely resembling the extracellular domain of the α7 receptor found in neurons. Recently, we constructed a cDNA encoding the Lymnaea AChBP by ligating a series of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides into an expression construct. The encoded protein was expressed to study its ligand recognition properties and structure in solution (11Hansen S.B. Radic Z. Talley T.T. Molles B.E. Deerinck T. Tsigelny I. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41299-41302Google Scholar). Other potential sequences of candidate AChBPs exist in data bases of invertebrate species. Herein, we describe the expression and properties of a distinct binding protein from a salt water mollusk, Aplysia californica. Although its sequence shares the hallmark features characteristic of the Lymnaea protein as well as the nicotinic receptor itself, the two binding proteins come from evolutionary distant species and show only 33% amino acid residue identity. Upon purification, the Aplysia protein revealed structural and ligand recognition properties distinct from the Lymnaea protein, enabling us to analyze comparatively two subtypes of binding proteins. Construction of an Expression Vector cDNA—The cDNA encoding the A-AChBP was synthesized using the nucleotide coding sequence found in an Aplysia data base. Briefly, oligonucleotides extending up to 100 bp and containing triplet codons with frequent mammalian codon usage (12Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Google Scholar) were ligated into a p3×FLAG-CMV-9 expression vector (Sigma) containing a preprotrypsin leader peptide followed by an N-terminal 3× FLAG epitope and a C-terminal His6 tag. Three alternative expression plasmids were synthesized and compared with the corresponding plasmids from the Lymnaea sequence. One had an N-terminal 3× FLAG but was devoid of the C-terminal (His) tag. The two others contained a 1× FLAG tag on the C terminus or N terminus. Restriction sites were also engineered into the coding sequence at convenient locations to allow for formation of removable cassettes for subsequent mutagenesis studies. Conditions for protein expression paralleled that of the Lymnaea AChBP (11Hansen S.B. Radic Z. Talley T.T. Molles B.E. Deerinck T. Tsigelny I. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41299-41302Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK cells were transfected with A-AChBP cDNA along with a companion neomycin acetyltransferase gene and selected for stable expression using G418. Medium containing the secreted A-AChBP was collected at 2–3-day intervals, and cells were replenished with fresh medium. Collected medium was preserved prior to purification with 0.02% NaN3. A-AChBPs were purified by adsorption onto a FLAG antibody column followed by elution with the 3× FLAG peptide. Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography—Gel filtration was carried out using an Amersham Biosciences LCC 500 plus fast protein liquid chromatograph with a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. Fifty μl of A-AChBP protein at a 100 μg/ml protein concentration in Tris-HCl-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) plus 0.02% azide was loaded on the column at a rate of 0.5 ml/min. Protein in the eluent was monitored by absorption at 280 nm. Sedimentation Equilibrium Analysis—Analytical ultracentrifugation was conducted in a Beckman/Coulter XL-I centrifuge equipped with UV absorption optics using a 60 Ti rotor. Protein solutions of 100 μg/ml were used in a six-channel charcoal-filled epon centerpiece loaded with 110 μl of sample and 125 μl of reference buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Individual samples were centrifuged at 20 °C for 16 h at 10,000 and 12,000 rpm. Equilibrium was attained as judged by overlay of the last three sequential scans. Data were recorded in step mode with a Δr of 0.001 cm, and five replicate absorption measurements were performed at each step every 2 h. A partial specific volume, ν¯=0.71, for AChBPs was calculated using Sednterp software (version 1.06), accounting for total sugar composition. Molar masses of the proteins were calculated using XL-A/XL-I data analysis software version 4.0 based on the Origin™ program. Estimation of Binding Parameters from Fluorescence Signals—Equilibrium fluorescence was monitored using a Tecan Safire fluorescence plate reader (Tecan) in 96-well UV plates (Costar). AChBP was excited at 280 nm, and emission intensity was monitored at 340 nm using an excitation and emission slit widths of 7.5 nm in a bottom read mode at room temperature. AChBP, 50–100 nm in binding site concentration, was equilibrated with half-log dilutions of ligand. Data were normalized, and Ki values were calculated by fitting to a sigmoidal dose-response curve with variable slope in Prism GraphPad 3.0. Y = minimum + (maximum – minimum)/(1 + 10((log EC50 – X)*Hill slope)), where X represents the log of concentration and Y is the fractional binding. Ki is calculated from Y50/(1 + ([ligand]/Kd)). To determine ligand stoichiometries, AChBP at 400–650 nm in binding sites, estimated from protein concentration, was titrated with sequentially increasing concentrations of epibatidine or methyllycaconitine. The concentration of binding sites greatly exceeded the Kd of the ligand. Accordingly, quenching was essentially linear with concentration until the binding sites were saturated and no further quenching was apparent. pH Stability of AchBPs—AChBP at a concentration of 0.5 nm binding sites was mixed with 0.1 mg/ml of beads for the PVT copper His6 tag scintillation proximity assay, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were suspended in 0.01 m phosphate/pyrophosphate buffer between pH 5.0 and 11. [3H]Epibatidine at 20 nm was added to the 200-μl reaction and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature at the respective pH for 1 h or the designated time and then read on a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter. Stopped-flow Kinetics—Stopped-flow measurements were obtained using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV (Leatherhead, UK) stopped-flow spectrofluorometer. AChBP was excited at 280 nm, and emission was monitored above 305 nm using a cut-off filter. Changes in fluorescence emission intensity were fit to a first order equation, and resulting rates were plotted versus ligand concentration. Association and dissociation were estimated from the slope and ordinate intercept. In addition, dissociation rate constants were estimated by monitoring the dissociation rate constants of the ligand-AChBP complex by the addition of excess gallamine and following the increase in fluorescence. Sufficient gallamine was used to ensure that the rate was limited by the dissociating ligand rather than the scavenging of free receptor by gallamine. Expression of the Acetylcholine-binding Protein from the Synthesized Oligonucleotide—Using the published sequence of AChBP from L. stagnalis, a blast search of the Entrez Pub Med protein data base yielded a sequence from A. californica (A-AChBP) that shared 33% amino acid identity with Lymnaea.It contained internal sequence features suggesting that it was a soluble binding protein rather than a truncated receptor sequence. Given that Aplysia and Lymnaea are evolutionarily distant mollusks, we reasoned that A-AChBP might be an ortholog with distinct pharmacological properties. Fig. 1 shows an alignment of soluble binding proteins with the N-terminal domains of transmembrane-spanning heteromeric (α1)2βγδ nicotinic receptor in muscle and the homomeric α7 neuronal receptor. A-AChBP lacks a transmembrane spanning region. Furthermore, the cysteine loop region between residues 127 and 140 (Aplysia numbering) is highly conserved among binding proteins but distinct from that of nAChRs, where it is also highly conserved among the receptor molecules. This region is thought to interact and link with the transmembrane domain of the receptor (7Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Google Scholar, 13Unwin N. Miyazawa A. Li J. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1165-1176Google Scholar) but reveals a hydrophilic surface in the case of the binding proteins. HEK 293 cells, transfected with the A-AChBP gene and selected as stable transfectants, secreted the encoded protein into the media. Typically between 1 and 3 mg of A-AChBP could be purified from a liter of medium. A cDNA encoding A-AChBP, isolated from a sensory cell Aplysia library, when placed in our viral expression vector, was found not to express active secreted protein. When sequenced, it was found to differ by valine being substituted to alanine at residues 43 and 138. A sequence with the two valine residue substitutions was not found in the Aplysia data base. Characterization of the Binding Protein—Due to variable aggregation of initial preparations of A-AChBP, we investigated the role played by a C-terminal His6 tag and several FLAG tags of variable length at both the N and C termini of the AChBP coding sequence (Fig. 2). Table I shows the typical expression achieved after purification for four constructs for both Lymnaea and Aplysia genes. Purified protein for each construct was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration. A His6 tag on the C terminus resulted in extensive aggregation or oligomerization in the Aplysia cDNA following purification. The aggregation varied from a small shoulder slightly larger than the pentameric 190 kDa to an aggregate peak in the void volume upon gel filtration (Fig. 3, C and D). The presence of the larger oligomers accumulated rapidly at room temperature and 4 °C. By contrast, the Lymnaea protein showed minimal aggregation initially but formed higher order oligomers over a period of several months when stored at 4 °C. Expression from constructs encoding both Lymnaea and Aplysia protein without the His6 tag yielded minimal aggregation over several months (Fig. 3, A and B). Both eluted at an apparent molecular weight of 190,000.Table IProperties of the acetylcholine-binding proteins from Lymnaea and AplysiaConstructPeptide MraMolecular weights designate calculated values for the mature peptide only.

Only the construct with a single C-terminal FLAG tag (III) migrated as a single but broad band. Its expression yields, however, were lower than those of the N-terminally tagged constructs (Table I). Neither initial aggregation nor heavy glycosylation was observed to influence ligand binding parameters, although the aggregated proteins were not studied in detail. Analytical ultracentrifugation yielded profiles that fit to a molecular weight estimate of 155,100 ± 1,400 for A-AChBP and 151,700 ± 800 for L-AChBP (Fig. 5), values expected for a glycosylated pentamer.Fig. 5Analytical ultracentrifugation of Aplysia AChBP.

[3H]Epibatidine sites were not lost during the 1-h incubation for L-AChBP between pH 5.5 and 11, whereas A-AChBP rapidly lost activity above pH 10. Above pH 8, L-AChBP was stable for 6 days but showed some loss of signal after 1 month. A-AChBP showed little binding above pH 8.0 after 6 days but was completely stable between pH 6.0 and 7.0 for the observed period. Ligand Binding Properties—To determine ligand recognition properties of A-AChBP, we employed an equilibrium-binding assay using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of AChBPs. Fig. 7 shows typical mass action curves of both L-AChBP and A-AChBP. Surprisingly, whereas only gallamine was found to enhance tryptophan fluorescence for L-AChBP, small cholinergic agonists such as choline, acetylcholine, and carbachol enhanced fluorescence emission of A-AChBP in addition to gallamine. Agonists, such as nicotine and epibatidine, containing ring nitrogens markedly quenched fluorescence of both AChBPs. Binding of ligands with Kd values below 100 nm was monitored using stopped-flow spectrometry and fluorescence detection (see Table III). Table II shows a summary of dissociation constants determined from tryptophan fluorescence either by equilibrium titration for lower affinity ligands or by kinetic analysis for the high affinity ligands. Interestingly, α-bungarotoxin has 100-fold lower affinity for A-AChBP than L-AChBP, but the smaller peptide, α-conotoxin ImI, has an affinity for A-AChBP that is more than 4 orders of magnitude greater than that for L-AChBP. Higher affinity of α-conotoxin ImI for Aplysia arises primarily from its slower dissociation rate (Table III). The slow binding, high affinity ligands appear to show a second unimolecular phase of low amplitude for tryptophan fluorescence quenching. This is being investigated in relation to overall mechanism. We reported previously L-AChBP to have five binding sites per pentamer (11Hansen S.B. Radic Z. Talley T.T. Molles B.E. Deerinck T. Tsigelny I. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41299-41302Google Scholar). Equilibrium titrations of A-AChBP at concentrations above its Kd value likewise reveal five sites per pentamer (Fig. 8). Titration profiles are very similar to those reported for the L-AChBP.Table IIIKinetic constants for association (k1) and dissociation (k–1) of various ligands for the acetylcholine-binding proteinsLigandk1k-1AplysiaLymnaeaAplysiaLymnaea× 108m-1 s-1s-1α-Conotoxin ImI0.160.0140.0119Epibatidine2.51.73.40.027Strychnine3.00.934.62.2Methyllycaconitine0.440.130.120.005Gallamine2.52.56536α-Bungarotoxin0.0100.0090.320.001(—)-Nicotine2.31.5495.7 Open table in a new tab Table IIDissociation constants for ligand binding to the Aplysia and Lymnaea acetylcholine-binding proteinsLigandAplysia KdLymnaea KdKd ratio L/Anmnmα-Conotoxin IMI0.88aKd values for high affinity ligands (Kd values of <100 nm) were determined from the ratio of association and dissociation rates by monitoring intrinsic tryptophan quenching with stopped-flow spectrofluorimetry.14,000aKd values for high affinity ligands (Kd values of <100 nm) were determined from the ratio of association and dissociation rates by monitoring intrinsic tryptophan quenching with stopped-flow spectrofluorimetry.16,000Methyllycaconitine2.8aKd values for high affinity ligands (Kd values of <100 nm) were determined from the ratio of association and dissociation rates by monitoring intrinsic tryptophan quenching with stopped-flow spectrofluorimetry.0.41bPreviously reported in Ref. 11.0.14Epibatidine14aKd values for high affinity ligands (Kd values of <100 nm) were determined from the ratio of association and dissociation rates by monitoring intrinsic tryptophan quenching with stopped-flow spectrofluorimetry.0.16bPreviously reported in Ref. 11.0.011Strychnine15aKd values for high affinity ligands (Kd values of <100 nm) were determined from the ratio of association and dissociation rates by monitoring intrinsic tryptophan quenching with stopped-flow spectrofluorimetry.23aKd values for high affinity ligands (Kd values of <100 nm) were determined from the ratio of association and dissociation rates by monitoring intrinsic tryptophan quenching with stopped-flow spectrofluorimetry.1.5Gallamine120cLow affinity ligands were measured using equilibrium fluorescence quenching in a 96-well fluorescent plate reader.

Open table in a new tab The discovery of an acetylcholine binding protein from the fresh water mollusk L. stagnalis and the elucidation of its structure by x-ray crystallography have added a new dimension to the study of the structure and ligand binding properties of the family of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and related pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (9Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Google Scholar). Moreover, linking structural details of the extracellular domain from crystallography at 2.8-Å resolution to electron microscopy reconstruction analysis of the transmembrane domain of the nAChR at 4 Å has yielded a more comprehensive structural perspective of the nicotinic receptor as an integral unit (2Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Google Scholar, 7Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Google Scholar, 8Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Google Scholar, 9Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Google Scholar). The multiplicity of the family of nicotinic receptor subunits and the diversity of subtypes that can be achieved through subunit assembly allow one to rank order selective ligands with respect to receptor subtype. The very size of the nAChR family exceeds the discrimination capacity of its ligands, precluding a receptor subtype classification based solely on ligand specificity. Nevertheless, ligand selectivity of receptor subtypes does allow studies of subtype distribution in regional tissue areas and during developmental processes (14Zoli M. Clementi F.F.D. Gotti C. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 144. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 213-246Google Scholar). Developing a complement of AChBPs with distinct specificities would enable one to add a structural dimension to the analysis of the determinants of ligand specificity, since the soluble proteins and their complexes can be analyzed in far more structural detail. To this end, we have synthesized a cDNA encoding an AChBP from A. californica and demonstrated that it assembles as a pentamer, has a stoichiometry of one ligand binding site per subunit or five per pentamer, and exhibits a general profile of ligand binding affinities characteristic of the nAChR. The capacity of the expressed Aplysia subunit to assemble as a stable pentamer has been compared with Lymnaea. Moreover, we have identified a signature ligand for the Aplysia AChBP ortholog where α-conotoxin ImI has 16,000-fold greater affinity for Aplysia over the Lymnaea protein. Other naturally occurring ligands of peptidic or alkaloid composition also show preferential affinities for the one or the other AChBPs. α-Conotoxin ImI is produced by Conus imperialis, a worm-hunting cone snail (15McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Google Scholar). This conotoxin is known to be a selective ligand for the α7 subtype among the nAChRs (16Johnson D.S. Martinez J. Elgoyhen A.B. Heinemann S.F. McIntosh J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 194-199Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that ligand specificity of the Aplysia AChBP more closely mimics the α7 receptor subtype than Lymnaea. Since the Aplysia and Lymnaea AChBPs only show 26 and 24% amino acid residue identity with the extracellular region of α7, neither binding protein would be a precise replicate homomeric mammalian receptor. However, they present a potential structural template for substitution of mammalian residue determinants of specificity. Synthesis, Assembly, and Stability of the Acetycholine-binding Protein—Using a mammalian expression system and cDNAs constructed from oligonucleotides designed to introduce restriction sites at strategic locations and weighted toward a mammalian codon abundance gives rise to expression and export of AChBP into the culture medium in quantities of several milligrams per liter. To increase the surface area of attached cells, we have employed multilayer 100-cm2 flasks, but the expression system should be applicable to other adhesion attachments for cell growth. Multiple medium changes and replenishment allow for continuous production from single plating for up to a month. As might be anticipated, expression levels of protein differ substantially between experimental constructs depending on the nature of the recognition tag and where it is placed on the construct. We have employed a FLAG epitope for purification and a His tag for both purification and development of a radioactive assay for the soluble protein. Expression can be achieved with both tags, but stability of the protein and the extent of glycosylation processing differ as evidenced by migration on SDS-PAGE. The products of the expression constructs also differ in their capacity to assemble as pentamers as evidenced by size exclusion chromatography and sedimentation analysis. We routinely examine our preparations to ensure that they are virtually devoid of monomeric species and higher orders of assembly or aggregates prior to analyzing binding parameters. Both AChBPs can be purified in quantities of several mg, offering the potential for physical investigations of their overall structure in relation to their ligand recognition properties. The purified proteins appear to be quite robust and retain their assembled structure and ligand binding properties for extended periods of time. Of the two, the Lymnaea protein appears to assemble more facilely under the many conditions employed and exhibit the greater stability as measured at extreme pH values. The extent of glycosylation appears dependent on the placement of the recognition tag for purification. Glycosylation also appears to be an important factor in the ease of crystallization of the two binding proteins. 2S. B. Hansen, unpublished observations. Determinants of Ligand Specificity—Since the pioneering findings of Silman and Karlin (17Silman I. Karlin A. Science. 1969; 164: 1420-1421Google Scholar), who demonstrated the importance of vicinal cysteines, now identified in the β9–β10 linker, in the recognition characteristics of the nAChR, elucidating the determinants of recognition for the receptor for the variety of natural and synthetic ligands has become a major endeavor. Studies with site-directed irreversible inhibitors, chemical cross-linking, and site-directed mutagenesis all have identified three noncontiguous segments on the face of the α-subunit and four on the opposing face of the adjacent subunit of the circular pentamer that harbor the side chain determinants governing ligand specificity (18Taylor P. Clementi F.F.D. Gotti C. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 144. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 79-100Google Scholar, 19Sine S.M. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 431-446Google Scholar). Identification of these regions and delineation of the characteristics of the residues involved has benefited greatly from the comparison of specificity of homologous subunits, generation of subunit chimeras, and site-directed residue substitutions from the homologous or orthologous subunits (18Taylor P. Clementi F.F.D. Gotti C. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 144. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 79-100Google Scholar). This approach is now possible with residue substitutions in the homomeric Lymnaea and Aplysia pair. The rate constants for association of α-bungarotoxin are far slower than the other ligands, suggesting that initial binding of this toxin induces a slow change in conformation or the α-toxin binds to a conformation of low abundance. The uniquely slow rates of α-toxin association with the receptor have been known for many years (20Lee C.Y. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. 1972; 12: 265-286Google Scholar, 21Weiland G. Georgia B. Lappi S. Chignell C.F. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7648-7656Google Scholar). For both α-conotoxin ImI and α-bungarotoxin, differences in affinity for the two AChBPs are reflected primarily in the dissociation rates. The two AChBPs also differ in several other properties that bear further experimental investigation. For example, the Aplysia protein has three tryptophans, whereas Lymnaea contains an additional tryptophan at position 53 (corresponding to 55 in Aplysia). This is a region in the muscle receptor shown to govern ligand specificity differences seen between the respective binding sites at the αγ, the αϵ, and the αδ subunit interfaces (18Taylor P. Clementi F.F.D. Gotti C. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 144. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 79-100Google Scholar, 19Sine S.M. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 431-446Google Scholar). Given the steric requirements for placement of a large indole ethyl side chain, tryptophan at this position becomes a candidate determinant of the distinct affinities found between the Aplysia and the Lymnaea AChBPs. Moreover, we have shown previously that many ligands quench the tryptophan fluorescence of the Lymnaea protein upon binding; these signals might be exploited further to monitor binding kinetics and ascertain binding orientation of the ligands. We are grateful to Dr. Kelsey Martin at UCLA for providing a sensory cell cDNA library from A. californica."

To clarify the molecular mechanism of this feedback loop, we sought to identify the PKC-ζ phosphorylation sites of IRS-1 and to investigate their biological significance. Upon incubation of recombinant IRS-1 fragments with PKC-ζ, we identified Ser318 of rat IRS-1 (Ser323 in human IRS-1) as the major in vitro phosphorylation site (confirmed by mutation of Ser318 to alanine). To monitor phosphorylation of Ser318 in cellular extracts, we prepared a polyclonal phosphosite-specific antibody. The biological significance was studied in baby hamster kidney cells stably expressing the insulin receptor (BHKIR). Using the phospho-Ser318-specific antibody we observed that insulin stimulates phosphorylation of Ser318 in IRS-1, which is mediated, at least partially, by PKC-ζ. Moreover, we found that the previously described insulin-stimulated, PKC-ζ-mediated inhibition of the interaction of IRS-1 with the insulin receptor and the reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was abrogated by mutation of IRS-1 Ser318 to alanine. These results, generated in BHKIR cells, suggest that phosphorylation of Ser318 by PKC-ζ might contribute to the inhibitory effect of prolonged hyperinsulinemia on IRS-1 function.

DC-SIGN expression is induced de novo during the generation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (1Geijtenbeek T.B. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C. Adema G.J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G.

However, DC-SIGN has been also detected on synovial, placenta, and alveolar macrophages (3Soilleux E.J. Morris L.S. Leslie G. Chehimi J. Luo Q. Levroney E. Trowsdale J. Montaner L.J. Doms R.W.

Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. de la Rosa G. Longo N. Navarro J. Muñoz-Fernandez M.A. Sanchez-Mateos P. Corbí A.L. J.

J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4504) Google Scholar). Given its characteristic cell-restricted expression and the relevance of its functional activities, the availability of a cell line with inducible DC-SIGN expression would facilitate the study of the molecular mechanisms that underlie DC differentiation and macrophage alternative activation pathways. In the present report we describe that myeloid THP-1 cells, widely used as a monocyte/macrophage differentiation model (21Tsuchiya S. Kobayashi Y. Goto Y. Okumura H. Nakae S. Konno T. Tada K. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1530-1536PubMed Google Scholar, 22Li Y. Mohammad R.M. al-Katib A. Varterasian M.L. Chen B. Leukoc. Res. 1997; 21: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Vey E.

Physiol. 1992; 153: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), display inducible expression of DC-SIGN, and acquire DC-SIGN-dependent functions when differentiated in the presence of protein kinase C activators and IL-4. The cytokines and factors that modulate DC-SIGN expression in differentiating THP-1 cells (IL-13, TNF-α, LPS, and vitamin D3) also affect DC-SIGN expression on monocytes and macrophages. These results indicate that the THP-1 cell line represents a useful cellular system for the analysis of the regulated expression and functional activities of DC-SIGN and suggest that DC-SIGN constitutes a marker for both DCs and alternatively activated macrophages. Cytokines and Reagents—GM-CSF (Leucomax) was purchased from Schering-Plough (Kenilworth, NJ) and used at 1000 units/ml. IL-4 and TGF-β were obtained from R&D (Abingdon, UK) and used at 1000 units/ml and 10 ng/ml, respectively. LPS from Escherichia coli 055:B5, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), bryostatin, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were obtained from Sigma. The JAK2/3 inhibitor AG-490 and the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 were purchased from Calbiochem and used at 30 ng/ml (AG-490) and 2.5 μm (U0126). Cells—The acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (complete medium) and maintained at 3–6 × 105 cells/ml. THP-1 differentiation was induced by treatment with PMA (10 ng/ml), bryostatin (10 nm), GM-CSF (1000 units/ml), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (50 nm), or TGF-β (10 ng/ml), either alone or in combination with IL-4 (1000 units/ml). In differentiation experiments cells were routinely seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml in tissue culture dishes with no change of the culture medium after addition of the differentiation inducer(s). Unless otherwise indicated, IL-4 was added into the cells 24 h after treatment with either PMA or bryostatin, and differentiation allowed to proceed for 96 h (PMA) or 72 h (bryostatin). For subsequent analysis, differentiated THP-1 cells were detached from tissue culture plates by incubation in PBS 5 mm EDTA on ice. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy coats from normal donors over a Lymphoprep (Nycomed, Norway) gradient according to standard procedures. Monocytes were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by a 1-h adherence step at 37 °C in complete medium or by magnetic cell sorting using CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). To generate monocyte-derived macrophages, adherent monocytes were cultured at 0.5–1 × 106 cells/ml in complete medium containing 1000 units/ml GM-CSF for 5–7 days, with cytokine addition every second day. Where indicated, macrophages were treated with IL-4 (1000 units/ml) for 48 h to generate alternatively activated macrophages (19Gordon S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (4748) Google Scholar). For DC differentiation, adherent monocytes were cultured in complete medium containing 1000 units/ml GM-CSF and 1000 units/ml IL-4, with cytokine addition every second day (20Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4504) Google Scholar). Leishmania pifanoi MHOM/VE/60Ltrod axenic amastigotes were grown at 31 °C in simplified F29 medium containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. K562 cells stably transfected with DC-SIGN were cultured as described previously (18Relloso M. Puig-Kröger A. Pello O.M. Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. de la Rosa G. Longo N. Navarro J. Muñoz-Fernandez M.A. Sanchez-Mateos P. Corbí A.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2634-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry and Antibodies—Cellular phenotypic analysis was carried out by indirect immunofluorescence. Monoclonal antibodies used for cell surface staining included BL6 (anti-CD1a, Immunotech, Marseille, France), B-T7 (anti-CD86), TS1/11 (anti-CD11a), UCH-M1 (anti-CD14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and MR1 (anti-DC-SIGN, CD209) (18Relloso M. Puig-Kröger A. Pello O.M. Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. de la Rosa G. Longo N. Navarro J. Muñoz-Fernandez M.A. Sanchez-Mateos P. Corbí A.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2634-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). All incubations were done in the presence of 50 μg/ml human IgG to prevent binding through the Fc portion of the antibodies. The supernatant from the myeloma P3X63 (X63) and the anti-c-myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody were always included as negative controls. Flow cytometry analysis was performed with an EPICS-XL flow cytometer (Coulter Científica, Madrid, Spain) using log amplifiers. Western Blot—Cell lysates were obtained in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm Pefabloc, and 2 mg/ml of aprotinin, antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin. 10 μg of each lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, protein detection was performed using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent system (Pierce). Detection of phospho-STAT and phospho-ERK was carried out using specific polyclonal antibodies anti-phospho-STAT5 Tyr641, anti-phospho-STAT5 Tyr694, or anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK Thr202-Tyr204 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). DC-SIGN was detected using a polyclonal antiserum raised against the 23-residue repeats within the neck region of the molecule. Northern Blot—After extensive washing in PBS, cells were harvested and total cellular RNA was isolated using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA integrity was initially confirmed in formaldehyde-containing agarose gels. Denatured RNA (10 μg) was size-fractionated on formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels in the presence of ethidium bromide. After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred overnight onto nitrocellulose membranes with 20× SSC. Pre-hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 250 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Membranes were hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C in the same solution containing 106 cpm/ml oligonucleotide-labeled probe. Blots were sequentially washed in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS at room temperature, in 0.3× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 65 °C, and exposed to x-ray film at -70 °C. Detection of DC-SIGN mRNA was accomplished using the full-length cDNA as probe (1Geijtenbeek T.B. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C. Adema G.J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Cell. 2000; 100: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar). Polymerase Chain Reaction—RT-PCR was performed essentially as described previously (25Puig-Kröger A. Sanz-Rodríguez F. Longo N. Sanchez-Mateos P. Botella L. Teixido J. Bernabeu C. Corbi A.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4338-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 2 μg of RNA from untreated or PMA- or PMA plus IL-4-treated THP-1 cells was reverse transcribed in a total volume of 20 μl of amplification buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 5 mm MgCl2,10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm of each deoxynucleotide, 0.5 μm random hexamers), including RNasin and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase at 1 unit/μl. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min, then at 42 °C for 60 min, and finally for 30 min at 52 °C, and the volume was then taken to 50 μl with water. Amplification was carried out on 5 μl of each cDNA synthesis reaction in 50 μl of a solution containing 0.2 mm of each deoxynucleotide, 1 μm of each oligonucleotide primer, and 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Preliminary experiments indicated that DC-SIGN mRNA was optimally amplified after 35 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 45 s), annealing (62 °C, 45 s), and extension (72 °C, 1 min), followed by a 10-min extension step at 72 °C. Oligonucleotides used for DC-SIGN mRNA amplification (CD209sense: 5′-GGGAATTCAGAGTGGGGTGACATGAGTGAC-3′ and CD209antisense: 5′-CCCCAAGCTTGTGAAGTTCTGCTACGCAGGAG-3′) (15Kwon D.S. Gregorio G. Bitton N.

Amplification of DC-SIGN isoforms was accomplished using the primer pairs CD209sense/CD209antisense, CD209soluble/CD209antisense, and CD209ALTCYT/CD209antisense. The oligonucleotide CD209soluble (5′-GATACAAGAGCTTAGCAGTGTCCA-3′) spans through the exon Ic/exon III junction previously described for potentially soluble transmembrane-lacking DC-SIGN isoforms. The oligonucleotide CD209ALTCYT (5′-GGGAATTCTGGCCAGCCATGGCCTCAGC-3′) includes the alternative translation initiation site found in exon Ib, which originates the DC-SIGN B isoform. Amplification of TLR4 was accomplished using the oligonucleotides TLR4forward (5′-CCCGATTCCATTGCTTCTTGC-3′) and TLR4reverse (5′-AGAGGTGGCTTAGGCTCTGATATGC-3′), which amplify a fragment of 266 bp from the corresponding mRNA. PCR-generated fragments were resolved in 1.5% agarose gels, purified, cloned, and sequenced following standard procedures. DC-CK1 (AMAC1, CCL18) chemokine mRNA was amplified with oligonucleotides 5′-ACAAAGAGCTCTGCTGCCTC-3′ (DC-CK1 sense) and 5′-CCCACTTCTTATGGGGTCA-3′ (DC-CK1 antisense), which amplify a 156-bp fragment (27Adema G.J. Hartgers F. Verstraten R. de Vries E. Marland G. Menon S. Foster J. Xu Y. Nooyen P. McClanahan T. Bacon K.B. Figdor C.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Control PCR reactions were performed using oligonucleotides 5′-GGCTGAGAACGGGAAGCTTGTCA-3′ and 5′-CGGCCATCACGCCACAGTTTC-3′ (1 μm), which together amplify a 417-bp fragment from the mRNA of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (28Hanauer A. Mandel J.L. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2627-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR of DC-SIGN was performed by amplifying duplicate samples of target cDNA in a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) using a SYBR Green kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) and a primer set for the DC-SIGN lectin domain. PCR was performed for 35 cycles with an annealing temperature of 52 °C, and double-stranded DNA was measured at 86 °C after each cycle. MDDC-induced Allogeneic T Lymphocyte Proliferation—Allogeneic T lymphocytes were obtained from peripheral blood of healthy adults using standard procedures. For T lymphocyte proliferation experiments, 1 × 105 T cells was stimulated in a 96-well plate with 0.5 × 103 irradiated (150 rads/min for 10 min) THP-1 cells subjected to various differentiation treatments or left untreated. After a 5-day incubation period, [3H]thymidine was added (1 μCi/well) during the last 16 h of co-culture, and thymidine incorporation was determined to evaluate the level of T cell proliferation. Inhibition experiments were performed by adding the corresponding monoclonal antibodies at 10 μg/ml and determining thymidine incorporation after 3 days. L. pifanoi Amastigotes Binding Assay—THP-1 cells differentiated in the presence of bryostatin plus IL-4 were resuspended in complete medium and aliquoted in 24-well plates. Parasites were labeled with the fluorescent dye CFSE (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) before adhesion to THP-1 cells. CFSE-labeled parasites were added onto the cells at a 5:1 ratio, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. For inhibition experiments, cells were washed with PBS/1 mm EDTA and preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with MR-1 anti-DC-SIGN antibody (1.2 μg/ml). Afterward, cells were fixed (1% paraformaldehyde in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature, and cells with and without attached parasites were resolved by flow cytometry in two peaks of low and high fluorescence intensity, using an EPICS-CS (Coulter Científica, Madrid, Spain), as described (8Colmenares M. Puig-Kröger A. Pello O.M. Corbí A.L. Rivas L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36766-36769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Basal and Inducible Expression of DC-SIGN in THP-1 Cells—As a first step in the analysis of the molecular mechanisms controlling DC-SIGN gene expression, we screened for myeloid cell lines with inducible DC-SIGN expression. Cell surface expression of DC-SIGN was not detected on U937, HL-60, Mono-Mac6, and K562 cells, either untreated or after differentiation in the presence of IL-4 (data not shown). By contrast, THP-1 leukemic cells, where DC-SIGN mRNA has been detected by RT-PCR (26Mummidi S. Catano G. Lam L. Hoefle A. Telles V. Begum K. Jimenez F. Ahuja S. Ahuja S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33196-33212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), exhibited a low basal expression of DC-SIGN (34% positive cells and 0.8 MFI) (Fig. 1A). IL-4 treatment of THP-1 cells promoted a weak but reproducible increase in DC-SIGN cell surface expression after 96 h (65% and 1.9 MFI), whereas GM-CSF had no effect and the combination of GM-CSF and IL-4 yielded no further increase in DC-SIGN expression (65% positive cells and 2.0 MFI) (Fig. 1A). Like IL-4, treatment with PMA, which triggers proliferation arrest and differentiation of THP-1 into monocyte-like cells (21Tsuchiya S. Kobayashi Y. Goto Y. Okumura H. Nakae S. Konno T. Tada K. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1530-1536PubMed Google Scholar), enhanced very slightly DC-SIGN expression after 96 h (68.3% positive cells and 1.9 MFI) (Fig. 1A). However, the simultaneous addition of PMA and IL-4 dramatically enhanced DC-SIGN cell surface levels (93.7% positive cells and 6.7 MFI) (Fig. 1A), indicating that IL-4 and PMA collaborate in enhancing DC-SIGN cell surface expression. The IL-4-mediated up-regulation of DC-SIGN was also evaluated in Western blot and confocal immunostaining experiments. As shown in Fig. 1B, the 44-kDa complex corresponding to monomeric DC-SIGN greatly increased in cells treated with PMA and IL-4. In accordance with these data, DC-SIGN was barely detectable in PMA-treated THP-1 cells, whereas cells differentiated in the presence of PMA and IL-4 contained high levels of cytoplasmic and cell surface DC-SIGN (Fig. 1C). Next, IL-4 was added at different time points after PMA treatment to analyze the kinetics of the DC-SIGN up-regulation. As shown in Fig. 2, IL-4 yielded similar levels of DC-SIGN up-regulation when added simultaneously or up to 48 h after the differentiation-inducing agent. In fact, IL-4 up-regulated DC-SIGN expression at all time points during the PMA-driven monocytic differentiation of THP-1 cells, even when present only during the last 24 h of culture (Fig. 2). In agreement with cell surface expression data, DC-SIGN mRNA was barely detectable in THP-1 cells, was weakly increased by either IL-4 or PMA, and was greatly enhanced by the simultaneous addition of PMA and IL-4 (Fig. 3A). Precise quantitation of the relative effects of PMA and IL-4 on DC-SIGN mRNA levels was performed using real-time PCR. DC-SIGN mRNA levels were significantly increased by PMA, and augmented more than 300-fold after a 24-h treatment with PMA and IL-4 (Fig. 3B), further confirming that the up-regulated expression of DC-SIGN reflects the augmented levels of DC-SIGN mRNA in PMA plus IL-4-treated THP-1 cells.Fig. 3Up-regulation of DC-SIGN mRNA in differentiating THP-1 cells. A, total cellular RNA was obtained from THP-1 cells subjected to the indicated treatments for 4 days. DC-SIGN mRNA level was determined by Northern blot, using the whole coding region as a probe (upper panel). The lower panel illustrates the loading of each lane in the formaldehyde-containing gel before transfer onto the nitrocellulose membrane. The positions of 28 S and 18 S rRNA are indicated.

To determine whether proliferation arrest was the only requirement for DC-SIGN up-regulation by IL-4, cells were incubated with bryostatin, vitamin D3, or TGF-β and subsequently treated with IL-4. Like PMA, bryostatin had a minor influence on basal DC-SIGN expression, whereas vitamin D3 abolished the weak basal DC-SIGN expression (Fig. 4A). Flow cytometry and analysis of cellular DC-SIGN content by Western blot revealed that addition of IL-4 dramatically up-regulates DC-SIGN on bryostatin-treated cells (Fig. 4, A and B), whereas it had no effect on vitamin D3- or TGF-β-treated cells (Fig. 4A and not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2035798073,"We present evidence for the existence of two phases of retinoic acid (RA) signaling required for vertebrate limb development. Limb RA synthesis is under the control of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (Raldh2) expressed in the lateral plate mesoderm, which generates a proximodistal RA signal during limb outgrowth. We report that Raldh2-/- embryos lack trunk mesodermal RA activity and fail to initiate forelimb development. This is associated with deficient expression of important limb determinants Tbx5, Meis2, and dHand needed to establish forelimb bud initiation, proximal identity, and the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), respectively. Limb expression of these genes can be rescued by maternal RA treatment limited to embryonic day 8 (E8) during limb field establishment, but the mutant forelimbs obtained at E10 display a significant growth defect associated with a smaller apical ectodermal ridge (AER), referred to here as an apical ectodermal mound (AEM). In these RA-deficient forelimbs, a ZPA expressing Shh forms, but it is located distally adjacent to the Fgf8 expression domain in the AEM rather than posteriorly as is normal. AER formation in Raldh2-/- forelimbs is rescued by continuous RA treatment through E10, which restores RA to distal ectoderm fated to become the AER. Our findings indicate the existence of an early phase of RA signaling acting upstream of Tbx5, Meis2, and dHand, followed by a late phase of RA signaling needed to expand AER structure fully along the distal ectoderm. During ZPA formation, RA acts early to activate expression of dHand, but it is not required later for Shh activation.

Ros M.A. Development. 2000; 127: 2133-2142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and studies in mouse have shown that dHand is required for Shh induction in limb buds (12Charite J. McFadden D.G. Olson E.N. Development. 2000; 127: 2461-2470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that Shh activation by RA may be indirect. Endogenous RA was originally reported to be higher posteriorly in limb buds, supporting a role for RA in imparting anteroposterior information (13Thaller C. Eichele G. Nature. 1987; 327: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), but measurements by others have disputed this conclusion (14Tamura K. Ohsugi K. Ide H. Dev. Biol. 1990; 140: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Scott Jr., W.J. Walter R. Tzimas G. Sass J.O. Nau H. Collins M.D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Also, the ZPA has been demonstrated to be devoid of local RA synthesis, indicating that the posterior region of limb buds does not generate RA (16Wanek N. Gardiner D.M. Muneoka K. Bryant S.V. Nature. 1991; 350: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 17Noji S. Nohno T. Koyama E. Muto K. Ohyama K. Aoki Y. Tamura K. Ohsugi K. Ide H. Taniguchi S. Saito T. Nature. 1991; 350: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Indeed, the nearest site of RA synthesis during limb bud development occurs in the proximal flanking mesoderm along the entire anteroposterior axis of the limb (18Swindell E.C. Thaller C. Sockanathan S. Petkovich M. Jessell T.M. Eichele G. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 19Mic F.A. Haselbeck R.J. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. Development. 2002; 129: 2271-2282PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a recent conclusion that RA signaling functions differentially along the anteroposterior axis of the limb bud (7Niederreither K. Vermot J. Schuhbaur B. Chambon P. Dollé P. Development. 2002; 129: 3563-3574PubMed Google Scholar) is not consistent with the source of RA synthesis. Instead, differential RA signaling along the proximodistal axis seems more likely as supported by the early studies on axolotl limb regeneration (8Maden M. Nature. 1982; 295: 672-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and more recent studies. By using inhibitors of RA synthesis or RA receptor antagonists, RA was reported to be required for Meis homeobox gene expression, which is normally limited to the proximal region of limb buds where it helps control proximodistal axis formation (6Mercader N. Leonardo E. Piedra M.E. Martínez-A C. Ros M.A. Torres M. Development. 2000; 127: 3961-3970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, excess RA induces proximodistal limb reductions, and this is associated with an increase in Meis expression (20Qin P. Cimildoro R. Kochhar D.M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. Teratology. 2002; 66: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that proximodistal limb expression of Meis genes is regulated by opposing signals, i.e. RA generated proximally acts positively and fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF8) generated distally acts negatively (6Mercader N. Leonardo E. Piedra M.E. Martínez-A C. Ros M.A. Torres M. Development. 2000; 127: 3961-3970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).RA synthesis from retinol (vitamin A) is a two-step enzymatic pathway with retinaldehyde as the intermediate. Genetic studies in mice have demonstrated that oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde is ubiquitous during development as it is controlled by ubiquitously expressed alcohol dehydrogenase Adh3 and several additional overlapping tissue-specific enzymes (21Molotkov A. Fan X. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Martras S. Farrés J. Parés X. Duester G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5337-5342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As for the second step, mouse genetic studies have shown that oxidation of retinaldehyde to RA is controlled by tissue-specific retinaldehyde dehydrogenase genes including Raldh1 (Aldh1a1) (22Fan X. Molotkov A. Manabe S.-I. Donmoyer C.M. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Blaner W.S. Lipton S.A. Duester G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), Raldh2 (Aldh1a2) (19Mic F.A. Haselbeck R.J. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. Development. 2002; 129: 2271-2282PubMed Google Scholar, 23Niederreither K. Subbarayan V. Dollé P. Chambon P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), and Raldh3 (Aldh1a3) (24Dupé V. Matt N. Garnier J.-M. Chambon P. Mark M. Ghyselinck N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14036-14041Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Raldh2 is expressed in paraxial, intermediate, and lateral plate mesoderm where it generates RA for several morphogenetic processes including limb bud development (18Swindell E.C. Thaller C. Sockanathan S. Petkovich M. Jessell T.M. Eichele G. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 19Mic F.A. Haselbeck R.J. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. Development. 2002; 129: 2271-2282PubMed Google Scholar). Raldh2-/- mouse embryos display a growth defect from E8.5 to E10.5 followed by lethality at E11.5 (19Mic F.A. Haselbeck R.J. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. Development. 2002; 129: 2271-2282PubMed Google Scholar, 23Niederreither K. Subbarayan V. Dollé P. Chambon P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). RALDH2 generates most of the RA observed in midgestation mouse embryos, and although all-trans-RA and its isomer 9-cis-RA were both originally hypothesized to be important for development, retinoid rescue studies on Raldh2-/- mouse embryos have shown that only all-trans-RA is needed physiologically to correct the overall growth defect caused by a lack of RALDH2 (25Mic F.A. Molotkov A. Benbrook D.M. Duester G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7135-7140Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Raldh2-/- embryos rescued by continuous maternal RA treatment exhibit relatively normal limb development up to E14.5, but limited maternal RA treatment (only up to E8) results in defects in forelimb skeletal development (7Niederreither K. Vermot J. Schuhbaur B. Chambon P. Dollé P. Development. 2002; 129: 3563-3574PubMed Google Scholar) and muscle development (26Mic F.A. Duester G. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).We now provide further insight into the spatiotemporal mechanism of RA action during early forelimb bud development by examining unrescued and RA-rescued Raldh2-/- embryos. We find that RA signaling is needed at two distinct time points during early forelimb bud development. In the early phase, RA is needed for lateral plate mesoderm to initiate forelimb budding, with loss of RA being associated with loss of expression of three transcription factors important for limb development: Tbx5 needed specifically for forelimb bud initiation (27Ahn D.-G. Kourakis M.J. Rohde L.A. Silver L.M. Ho R.K. Nature. 2002; 417: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), Meis2 required for proximal limb identity (6Mercader N. Leonardo E. Piedra M.E. Martínez-A C. Ros M.A. Torres M. Development. 2000; 127: 3961-3970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Qin P. Cimildoro R. Kochhar D.M. Soprano K.J. Soprano D.R. Teratology. 2002; 66: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and dHand, which provides competence to form a ZPA (11Fernandez-Teran M. Piedra M.E. Kathiriya I.S. Srivatava D. Rodriguez-Rey J.C. Ros M.A. Development. 2000; 127: 2133-2142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Charite J. McFadden D.G. Olson E.N. Development. 2000; 127: 2461-2470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the late phase, RA activity is localized differentially along the proximodistal axis of the developing forelimb bud (but uniformly along the anteroposterior axis), and RA is needed to allow the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and its associated Fgf8 expression to expand fully along the distal ectoderm of the limb. This is important as Fgf8 expression in the AER is essential for maintenance of limb outgrowth (28Sun X. Mariani F.V. Martin G.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRescue of Raldh2-/-Embryos by Limited RA Treatment—Rescue of Raldh2-/- embryos by limited RA treatment was performed as described (19Mic F.A. Haselbeck R.J. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. Development. 2002; 129: 2271-2282PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, all-trans-RA was dissolved in corn oil and administered orally to timed-pregnant mice (2.5 mg/kg) at 12-h intervals on embryonic days E7.25, E7.75, and E8.25. Embryos were examined at stages E9.5 to E10.25. RA administered in this fashion was previously shown to be cleared by E9.25 (24 h after the last RA dose) through examination of the decay in β-galactosidase activity induced by RA administration to mice carrying the RARE-lacZ RA-reporter gene (19Mic F.A. Haselbeck R.J. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. Development. 2002; 129: 2271-2282PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, RARE-lacZ expression detected at E9.25 and later is indicative of endogenously synthesized RA, and does not represent the administered RA.Rescue of Raldh2-/-Embryos by Continuous RA Treatment—Rescue of Raldh2-/- embryos by continuous RA treatment was performed similar to experiments described previously (25Mic F.A. Molotkov A. Benbrook D.M. Duester G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7135-7140Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, all-trans-RA was dissolved in corn oil and mixed with powdered food at 0.1 mg/g for treatment on E7.5 and at 0.25 mg/g for treatment on E8.5 to E10.5. Such food was prepared fresh each day. Previous studies have shown that this dietary RA treatment provides close to a physiological amount of RA to embryos as assessed by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of treated E10.5 embryos (25Mic F.A. Molotkov A. Benbrook D.M. Duester G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7135-7140Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).Detection of Retinoic Acid Activity—Detection of RA activity was performed in embryos carrying the RARE-lacZ RA-reporter transgene which places lacZ (encoding β-galactosidase) under the transcriptional control of a retinoic acid response element (RARE) (29Rossant J. Zirngibl R. Cado D. Shago M. Giguère V. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). β-galactosidase staining was performed for 18 h with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as substrate.Detection of mRNA—Embryonic mRNA was detected by whole-mount in situ hybridization as described (30Wilkinson D.G. Wilkinson D.G. In Situ Hybridization: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 75-83Google Scholar) except that proteinase K was omitted for examination of genes expressed in limb ectoderm (Fgf8 and Fgf4). Stained embryos were embedded in 3% agarose and sectioned at 50 μm with a vibratome. At least three embryos were examined for each expression pattern reported.RESULTSRA Is Required for Initiation of Forelimb Bud Development and ZPA Competence—We have previously reported that Raldh2-/- embryos lack RA activity in the trunk mesoderm by examination of wild-type and Raldh2-/- embryos carrying a RARE-lacZ RA-reporter transgene (19Mic F.A. Haselbeck R.J. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. Development. 2002; 129: 2271-2282PubMed Google Scholar). For comparison purposes, we show here the RARE-lacZ expression patterns of wild-type and Raldh2-/- embryos at E9.0 when the forelimb bud fields are being established (Fig. 1, A and B). The mutant lacks RA activity in the trunk mesoderm (including the lateral plate mesoderm where limb buds arise), although some RA activity is retained in the eye, heart, and neural tube possibly because of other RA-generating enzymes as suggested previously (19Mic F.A. Haselbeck R.J. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. Development. 2002; 129: 2271-2282PubMed Google Scholar). At E10.25, RA activity should normally exist at the proximal base of the limbs, but the forelimb bud field of Raldh2-/- embryos still lacks RA activity and there is no sign of limb development (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, Raldh2-/- embryos develop without any RA available to cells that establish the limb bud fields.During limb bud initiation, several genes are activated in the lateral plate mesoderm that play essential roles. Meis2 encodes a homeobox transcription factor expressed in the lateral plate mesoderm and subsequently in the proximal limb mesoderm that is required as a determinant of proximal limb identity (31Mercader N. Leonardo E. Azpiazu N. Serrano A. Morata G. Martinez C. Torres M. Nature. 1999; 402: 425-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In E9.0 Raldh2-/- embryos we found that Meis2 expression was not detected in the lateral plate mesoderm and somites as normal but was still present in the hindbrain (Fig. 1, E and F). dHand (Hand2) encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor expressed early in the lateral plate mesoderm that is required later for activation of Shh expression in the posterior limb bud during ZPA formation (11Fernandez-Teran M. Piedra M.E. Kathiriya I.S. Srivatava D. Rodriguez-Rey J.C. Ros M.A. Development. 2000; 127: 2133-2142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Charite J. McFadden D.G. Olson E.N. Development. 2000; 127: 2461-2470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At E9.0, wild-type embryos expressed dHand in the lateral plate mesoderm along the posterior portion of the forelimb bud field where the ZPA will later form, but Raldh2-/- embryos exhibited no detection of dHand expression in that region although expression was still observed in the heart and allantois (Fig. 1, G and H). Tbx5 encodes a T-box transcription factor essential for forelimb bud development expressed specifically in that region of the lateral plate mesoderm that gives rise to the forelimb buds and then later throughout the forelimb bud mesoderm (27Ahn D.-G. Kourakis M.J. Rohde L.A. Silver L.M. Ho R.K. Nature. 2002; 417: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In E9.5 Raldh2-/- embryos, Tbx5 expression in the forelimb bud field was absent although expression was still observed in the eye and heart (Fig. 1, I and J). Fgf8 is normally expressed at E9.5 in the distal ectoderm of wild-type forelimb buds, but Raldh2-/- embryos lacked Fgf8 expression in the forelimb field (Fig. 1, K and L). These findings suggest that RA signaling in the lateral plate mesoderm is required to make this tissue competent to form the limb bud fields and that RA acts upstream of genes needed for forelimb bud initiation (Tbx5), proximal identity (Meis2), and competence to form a ZPA (dHand).RA Treatment on E7 to E8 Rescues Forelimb Bud Initiation but Not Outgrowth—Raldh2-/- embryos examined at E10.25 following limited maternal RA treatment from E7.25 to E8.25 were found to overcome the block in limb bud development. In such embryos hindlimb buds were relatively normal in appearance, but forelimb buds exhibited growth retardation (Fig. 2, A and B). Examination of RARE-lacZ expression in E10.25-rescued Raldh2-/- embryos revealed an absence of RA activity in the forelimb bud field, but some RA activity was observed in the hindlimb bud field in the vicinity of the mesonephros (Fig. 2, A and B). We have previously reported that rescued Raldh2-/- embryos retain RA activity in the mesonephros associated with expression of a related RA-generating gene, Raldh3 (19Mic F.A. Haselbeck R.J. Cuenca A.E. Duester G. Development. 2002; 129: 2271-2282PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Raldh3 or some other gene may be responsible for allowing apparently normal hindlimb bud outgrowth in rescued Raldh2-/- embryos, but evidently there is no other RA-generating enzyme that can supply RA to forelimb buds after RA treatment has ended. This suggests that there are two phases of RA action during forelimb budding and that our limited RA treatment has rescued only an early phase needed for limb bud initiation but not a late phase needed for outgrowth.Fig. 2RA treatment on E7 to E8 rescues forelimb bud initiation but not outgrowth.A and B, RA activity monitored by RARE-lacZ expression in E10.25 wild-type (WT) and Raldh2-/- embryos following limited maternal RA treatment from E7.25 to E8.25; in rescued Raldh2-/- embryos RA activity is absent in the lateral plate mesoderm near the forelimb bud that shows growth retardation, but RA is still present in the mesonephros adjacent to the hindlimb which shows normal growth. C and D, limited RA treatment restores Meis2 mRNA in an E10.25 rescued Raldh2-/- embryo to the lateral plate mesoderm adjacent to both forelimbs and hindlimbs. E and F, limited RA treatment restores Tbx5 mRNA to the growth-retarded forelimb bud of an E10.25 rescued Raldh2-/- embryo. G and H, Fgf10 expression is present in the growth-retarded forelimb bud of an E9.75-rescued Raldh2-/- embryo. f, forelimb bud; h, hindlimb bud; lpm, lateral plate mesoderm; m, mesonephros.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Examination of E10.25-rescued Raldh2-/- embryos revealed that Meis2 expression was restored to the lateral plate mesoderm adjacent to the forelimb and hindlimb bud fields (Fig. 2, C and D). Also, E10.25-rescued Raldh2-/- embryos exhibited Tbx5 expression throughout the small growth-retarded forelimb bud (Fig. 2, E and F). We also examined expression of Fgf10, which generates a mesodermal FGF signal required for limb bud initiation (32Sekine K. Ohuchi H. Fujiwara M. Yamasaki M. Yoshizawa T. Sato T. Yagishita N. Matsui D. Koga Y. Itoh N. Kato S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Fgf10 is normally expressed throughout the early forelimb bud mesoderm and functions downstream of Tbx5 but upstream of AER formation (33Ng J.K. Kawakami Y. Buscher D. Raya A. Itoh T. Koth C.M. Esteban C.R. Rodriquez-Leon J. Garrity D.M. Fishman M.C. Belmonte J.C.I. Development. 2002; 129: 5161-5170PubMed Google Scholar). Rescued Raldh2-/- embryos exhibited Fgf10 expression at E9.75 throughout the small growth-retarded forelimb bud (Fig. 2, G and H). These results indicate that limited maternal RA treatment of Raldh2-/- embryos can simulate an early phase of embryonic Raldh2 function needed for initiation of forelimb and hindlimb bud development but that a late phase of Raldh2 function is also needed for outgrowth of forelimb buds. It can be concluded that this late phase of RA action during forelimb bud development is downstream of Meis2, Tbx5, and Fgf10 as all of these genes are expressed in growth-retarded mutant forelimb buds. The late phase of RA action is also downstream of dHand as previous studies have shown that a similar limited RA treatment of Raldh2-/- embryos results in expression of dHand in growth-retarded forelimb buds (7Niederreither K. Vermot J. Schuhbaur B. Chambon P. Dollé P. Development. 2002; 129: 3563-3574PubMed Google Scholar).Raldh2 Is Required for AER Formation in Forelimb Buds—The apical ectodermal ridge is characterized as a distal thickening of the ectoderm necessary for limb proximodistal outgrowth (34Saunders Jr., J.W. J. Exp. Zool. 1948; 108: 363-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The AER is derived from distal-ventral limb ectoderm with Fgf8 expression being a morphological marker of this tissue. Fgf8 expression also marks the mature AER and is necessary for AER function during proximodistal limb outgrowth (28Sun X. Mariani F.V. Martin G.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The growth-retarded Raldh2-/- forelimb buds obtained at E10.25 following limited RA treatment were found to lack Fgf8 mRNA along the AER and instead displayed Fgf8 expression in a small mound located distally and centrally (Fig. 3, A and B). Transverse sections through this small distocentral mound of Fgf8 expression in a rescued Raldh2-/- forelimb bud indicated the existence of a distal ectodermal thickening containing Fgf8 mRNA, although it is somewhat smaller than the distal thickening observed in a central transverse section of a wild-type forelimb bud (Fig. 3, C and D). A transverse section posterior to the mound of Fgf8 expression in a rescued Raldh2-/- forelimb bud revealed a lack of Fgf8 mRNA and no evidence of a distal ectodermal thickening in contrast to a wild-type forelimb bud (Fig. 3, E and F). AER structure was also missing in anterior transverse sections of a rescued Raldh2-/- forelimb bud but apparent in wild type (data not shown). The small central ectodermal thickening found in rescued Raldh2-/- forelimb buds is referred to as an apical ectodermal mound rather than a ridge as it lacks any significant length along the anteroposterior axis. These findings demonstrate that continued action of Raldh2 after forelimb bud initiation is necessary to produce a complete AER.Fig. 3Raldh2 is required for AER formation in forelimb buds.Fgf8 mRNA was examined in E10.25 wild-type and Raldh2-/- (-/-) forelimb buds rescued by limited maternal RA treatment from E7.25 to E8.25. A and B, rescued Raldh2-/- forelimb buds display greatly reduced outgrowth and an abnormally small domain of Fgf8 mRNA located distally and centrally. AER structure was examined in transverse sections through the center (C and D) and posterior (E and F) region of the wild-type (WT) and rescued Raldh2-/- forelimb buds shown in A and B. A distal ectodermal thickening exhibiting Fgf8 mRNA is observed in wild-type forelimb buds both centrally and posteriorly representing the AER (C and E). However, in rescued Raldh2-/- forelimb buds such a distal thickening is observed centrally (D) but not posteriorly (F), demonstrating the lack of a true AER. We refer to the central thickening as an AEM instead of a ridge. A, anterior; D, dorsal; di, distal; P, posterior; pr, proximal; V, ventral.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Several FGF genes are expressed in the AER, but it has been conclusively demonstrated through analysis of double conditional null mutants that elimination of just Fgf8 and Fgf4 prevents limb bud proximodistal outgrowth (28Sun X. Mariani F.V. Martin G.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Fgf8 is normally expressed at early stages (E9.0 to 9.5) in ventral surface ectoderm and then at later stages as a band all along the anteroposterior axis of the distal ectoderm, which by E9.5 to 9.75 becomes morphologically distinct as the AER (35Lewandoski M. Sun X. Martin G.R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 36Moon A.M. Capecchi M.R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Fgf8 mRNA was not observed in E9.5 Raldh2-/- forelimbs rescued by limited RA treatment, whereas Fgf8 was apparent in the ventral ectoderm of wild-type forelimb buds (Fig. 4, A and B). At E9.75, Fgf8 mRNA was observed in rescued Raldh2-/- forelimbs but was limited to a small distocentral domain (Fig. 4, C and D), similar to that seen at E10.25 (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, a loss of Raldh2 leads to a delay in the onset of forelimb bud Fgf8 expression followed by expression limited to a centrally located apical ectodermal mound.Fig. 4Raldh2 deficiency disrupts Fgf8, Fgf4, and Shh expression during outgrowth of forelimb buds. Wild-type (WT) and Raldh2-/- embryos rescued by limited maternal RA treatment from E7.25 to E8.25 were examined by whole-mount in situ hybridization. A and B, at E9.5 no expression of Fgf8 mRNA is detected in the rescued mutant. C and D, at E9.75 Fgf8 mRNA in the rescued mutant is limited to a small distal-central domain.

Eight GSTs were identified in seedlings grown under control conditions, and only one, AtGSTU19, was induced by benoxacor. In contrast, four GSTs, AtGSTF2, AtGSTF6, AtGSTF7, and AtGSTU19, were significantly more abundant in copper-treated seedlings. The different responses to these treatments may reflect the potential for copper to affect many more aspects of plant growth and physiology compared with a herbicide safener. Differences between RNA and protein expression of GSTs indicate that both transcriptional and translational mechanisms are involved in regulation of GSTs under these conditions.

Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar).GSTs are grouped into distinct classes based on a number of criteria, including protein sequence, gene structure, immunological cross-reactivity, kinetic properties, and structural characteristics (3Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). Some classes of GSTs are taxa-specific whereas others are found across kingdoms. Plant GSTs fall into one of six classes: Phi, Tau, Theta, Zeta, Lambda, and glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductases (DHARs). The two largest classes, Phi and Tau, are plant-specific, whereas the Theta and Zeta classes are also found in mammals, fungi, and insects. To date, Lambda and DHAR-type GSTs have been identified only in plants (5Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar).Many plant GSTs have been characterized as enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to a variety of xenobiotics, notably herbicides. Studies with compounds known as herbicide safeners, which are used to enhance herbicide tolerance of crop plants, have contributed to the understanding of this primary function of GSTs in plants (6Davies J. Caseley J.C. Pestic. Sci. 1999; 55: 1043-1058Crossref Google Scholar). Safeners may increase herbicide tolerance by a number of mechanisms, but the bulk of the evidence indicates they selectively induce GSTs that detoxify specific herbicides. For example, the safener benoxacor protects maize from chloroacetanilide herbicides (e.g. metolachlor and alachlor) by increasing the expression of GSTs that efficiently conjugate these herbicides to GSH but has no protective effect on dicotyledenous weeds (7Irzyk G.P. Fuerst E.P. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).As potent inducers of GST expression, safeners can help to elucidate the signaling pathways that govern the expression of plant GSTs involved in xenobiotic detoxification. A recent study (8DeRidder B.P. Dixon D.P. Beussman D.J. Edwards R. Goldsbrough P.B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1497-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) demonstrated that RNA expression of several Arabidopsis GST genes is differentially induced by a number of safeners. These results suggest that induction of Arabidopsis GSTs by safeners is complex and occurs via multiple signaling pathways.Aside from their role in xenobiotic detoxification, plant GSTs also provide protection against oxidative stress. Functioning as glutathione peroxidases, plant GSTs can catalyze the reduction of hydroperoxides to less harmful alcohols (9Roxas V.P. Smith R.K. Allen E.R. Allen R.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 10Cummins I. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant J. 1999; 18: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Expression of a GST with glutathione peroxidase activity in transgenic tobacco provided protection against oxidative stress (11Roxas V.P. Lodhi S.A. Garrett D.K. Mahan J.R. Allen R.D. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Plant GSTs may also protect against oxidative stress by conjugating GSH to toxins produced as a result of oxidative damage to endogenous compounds. For example, heavy metals (e.g. copper) can induce oxidative stress, resulting in membrane lipid peroxidation and the formation of cytotoxic alkenals (12De Vos C.H.R. ten Bookum W.M. Vooijs R. Schat H. de Kok L.J. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1993; 31: 151-158Google Scholar). One such alkenal, 4-hydroxynonenal, is a substrate for Phi class GSTs from sorghum (13Gronwald J.W. Plaisance K.L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 877-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and wheat Tau class GSTs exhibit similar activities (14Cummins I. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 59: 35-49Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar).In addition to their roles in xenobiotic detoxification and oxidative stress tolerance, plant GSTs also catalyze metabolic isomerization reactions. For example, AtGSTZ1 participates in tyrosine catabolism in Arabidopsis by catalyzing the cis-trans conversion of maleylacetoacetate to fumarylacetoacetate (4Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Finally, some plant GSTs function as nonenzymatic binding proteins of endogenous compounds such as anthocyanins and phytohormones (2Marrs K.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 127-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 15Mueller L.A. Goodman C.D. Silady R.A. Walbot V.

Plant. 1998; 103: 114-124Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar).The GST gene family in Arabidopsis includes 53 genes (5Dixon D.P. Davis B.G. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30859-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 17Wagner U. Edwards R. Dixon D.P. Mauch F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 515-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Given the diverse functions of GSTs in plants, it is not surprising that a wide range of factors induce RNA expression of these genes, including herbicides, heavy metals, extreme temperatures, phytohormones, and pathogen attack (2Marrs K.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 127-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 3Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). Although an abundance of data has been gathered on RNA expression of many of these GSTs, much less is known about the regulation of GST protein expression. The objectives of this study, therefore, were to identify the GSTs expressed in Arabidopsis seedlings and to quantify the impact of various environmental conditions on GST protein expression. Two major functions carried out by plant GSTs are detoxification of xenobiotics and protection against oxidative stress. Therefore, we examined the expression of Arabidopsis GSTs in response to an herbicide safener, benoxacor, and an inducer of oxidative stress, copper, both of which are agents that provide conditions for addressing these two important functions of plant GSTs. Because of the paucity of information about GST protein expression, a proteomic approach was used to examine multiple GST proteins simultaneously.Using a method adapted from the signature peptide approach (18Geng M. Ji J. Regnier F.E. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 870: 295-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19Regnier F. Amini A. Chakraborty A. Geng M. Ji J. Riggs L. Sioma C. Wang S. Zhang X. LC GC North America. 2001; 19: 200-213Google Scholar), eight GSTs were identified in Arabidopsis seedlings: AtGSTF2, AtGSTF6, AtGSTF7, AtGSTF8, AtGSTF9, AtGSTF10, AtGSTU19, and AtGSTU20. The herbicide safener benoxacor induced accumulation of AtGSTU19, whereas copper treatment resulted in higher levels of AtGSTF2, AtGSTF6, AtGSTF7, and to a lesser extent AtGSTU19. In contrast, AtGSTF9 was significantly less abundant in response to both treatments. Although RNA expression generally reflected the changes in abundance of GST proteins in response to benoxacor and copper, transcript levels of AtGSTF8, AtGSTF9, and AtGSTF10 were notable exceptions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Extraction and Purification—Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Columbia, were germinated in half-strength Murashige and Skoog liquid medium, grown for 9 days, and treated for 24 h with 100 μm benoxacor (Syngenta, Greensboro, NC) or 50 μm CuSO4. The seedlings were then harvested, weighed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C. Seedlings (75–100 g) were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a chilled mortar and pestle and homogenized in 3 volumes (w:v) of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) using a Cyclone IQ2 microprocessor system (Virtis, Gardiner, NY). After filtration through eight layers of cheesecloth and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was brought to 80% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4), and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The pellets were resuspended in a small volume of saturated (NH4)2SO4 and stored at –20 °C. The precipitated protein was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min and then dissolved in ∼2 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 5 mm dithiothreitol. Protein samples were dialyzed (12,000–14,000 molecular weight cutoff) (Spectra/Por, Spectrum Laboratories Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA) for 2 h against 1 liter of phosphate-buffered saline containing dithiothreitol, with one change of buffer. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min to remove undissolved material. The proteins were applied to a GSH-agarose affinity column (5-ml bed volume) (G-4510, Sigma) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min–1 followed by a wash (5 column volumes) with phosphate-buffered saline buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1. Bound proteins were eluted with 20 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm GSH) at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1. Eluted proteins were concentrated and dialyzed against 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (10-kDa cutoff) (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Protein samples were kept at 4 °C or on ice at all times, and protein concentrations were determined using bovine serum albumin as a standard (20Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses were carried out as described using polyclonal antibodies against AtGSTF2 or AtGSTU19 (21Smith A.P. Nourizadeh S.D. Peer W.A. Xu J. Bandyopadhyay A. Murphy A.S. Goldsbrough P.B. Plant J. 2003; 36: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Trypsin Digestion and Peptide Acetylation—Protein samples obtained by GSH affinity chromatography were diluted with 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 9 m urea to give a final urea concentration of 7 to 8 m. Cysteine sulfhydryls were reduced by the addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. Free sulfhydryl groups were alkylated with iodoacetic acid (final concentration 20 mm) in the dark on ice for 2 h. The alkylation reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 mm cysteine followed by incubation on ice for 5 min. Samples were diluted with 0.1 m HEPES, pH 8.0, to a final urea concentration of 1 m. One microgram of sequencing grade-modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) was added for every 50 μg of protein in the sample. Proteolysis was carried out at 37 °C for 12 h and then quenched with 1 mg of Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK). One milligram of acetoxysuccinamide was added to the control samples, and 1 mg of d3-acetoxysuccinamide, synthesized as described previously (18Geng M. Ji J. Regnier F.E. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 870: 295-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), was added to the experimental samples. The samples were stirred at room temperature for 4 h, and each experimental sample (derived from either benoxacor- or copper-treated tissue) was combined with its respective control sample. To reverse the acetylation of hydroxyl groups on tyrosine residues, 2 mg of hydroxylamine hydrochloride was added to each mixture. The pH was adjusted to 12.0 with 5 m NaOH, and the mixtures were stirred at room temperature for 10 min. Glacial acetic acid was added to adjust the pH to 8.0, and the samples were dried in a centrifuge dryer.Reverse-phase Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry—The acetylated tryptic peptides were dissolved in 500 μl of water and separated over a Microsorb-MV 100–5 C18 reverse-phase column (Varian, Palo Alto, CA), with water and acetonitrile (both containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1 using a gradient of 15–60% acetonitrile over 25 min followed by a step elution to 100% acetonitrile over 5 min. Thirty fractions of 1 ml each were collected, dried in a centrifuge dryer, and dissolved in 100 μl of 50% (v:v) methanol:water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. These samples were injected into a Q-Star electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA) at 8 μl min–1. Masses were scanned from m/z 300 to 2000 at default voltage potentials, and abundant peptides were fragmented by restricting the ion gate voltage. Peptide parent ion masses were analyzed with Mascot (www.matrixscience.com). Mascot parameters included proteolysis by trypsin/chymotrypsin with one missed cleavage, alkylation of cysteine residues with iodoacetic acid, and size tolerances of 0.5 Da for peptides and 0.2 Da for peptide fragments. Variable modifications included sodiated (C-terminal), sodiated (D/E), acetyl heavy (K), acetyl heavy (N-terminal), acetyl light (K), and acetyl light (N-terminal). The relative abundance of GST peptides in control and benoxacor- or copper-treated samples was calculated as the ratio of their respective monoisotopic peak intensities.Isolation and Analysis of RNA—Total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings, separated by electrophoresis through formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to a nylon membrane, UV cross-linked, and hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNAs as described previously (21Smith A.P. Nourizadeh S.D. Peer W.A. Xu J. Bandyopadhyay A. Murphy A.S. Goldsbrough P.B. Plant J. 2003; 36: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).For real-time PCR analysis of the transcript for the copper-induced protein encoded by At2g28540, RNA was first treated with DNase (DNA-free, Ambion, Austin, TX). Complementary DNA was synthesized in a 30-μl reaction containing 2 μg of RNA, 500 ng of oligo(dT), 0.5 mm dNTPs, and 1 μl of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). After incubation at 42 °C for 50 min, the reverse transcriptase was inactivated by incubation at 70 °C for 10 min. The cDNA was diluted to 600 μl, and 5 μl was used as a template for PCR. The gene-specific primers for At2g28540 were 5′-ACCACCTGGCTTTTCAGTT-3′ and 5′-TCTGCATAGACAAAGGGTT-3′. Expression levels were normalized to that of a tubulin RNA (At5g12250) using the primers 5′-TGGGAACTCTGCTCATATCT-3′ and 5′-GAAAGGAATGAGGTTCACTG-3′. Real-time PCR was performed using an iCycler iQ (Bio-Rad) with SYBR I as the fluorescence dye. Each reaction was performed in 20-μl aliquots containing Taq DNA polymerase, the appropriate primer pair (250 nm), 0.25 mm dNTPs, 2 mm MgCl2, SYBR I, and fluorescein. After the initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, 40 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 30 s), annealing (55 °C, 20 s), and polymerization (72 °C, 20 s) were performed. All assays were carried out in triplicate. The PCR products were quantified at each amplification step. The specificity of each PCR reaction was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and melting curve analysis, which was determined by measuring the decline in fluorescence as temperature increased from 55 °C to 95 °C. Threshold cycles (CT) at which the fluorescence of the PCR product-SYBR I complex first exceeded the background were determined by integrated analysis software. To compare the level of expression in different samples, the difference between the CT of the target gene and the CT for the tubulin standard was calculated as ΔCT (target gene) = CT (target) – CT (tubulin). Relative transcript levels were calculated as 1000 × 2ΔCT.RESULTSIdentification of Expressed Arabidopsis GSTs—Proteolysis of a soluble protein extract from seedlings generates a complex mixture of a very large number of peptides, which can pose problems for further analysis. To reduce this complexity and to preferentially examine GSH-binding proteins such as GSTs, a GSH affinity purification step was included before proteolysis. Proteins eluted from the GSH affinity column were reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were acetylated and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). In our initial experiments, these peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight MS. Although nearly 100 peptides were detected, they could not be assigned unequivocally to specific Arabidopsis GSTs because the masses of most peptides matched the predicted masses of peptides from more than one Arabidopsis GST (data not shown). Therefore, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was used to obtain information about the amino acid sequences of peptides, which allowed for unambiguous identification of the specific GSTs from which most of these peptides were derived.This approach was used to analyze and identify the GST proteins expressed in Arabidopsis seedlings. The recovery of proteins after GSH affinity chromatography indicates that GSTs comprise ∼0.1% of the soluble protein in Arabidopsis seedlings. A total of 87 peptides obtained from this affinity-purified sample were analyzed by MS/MS. Based on high probability matches obtained by using the Mascot peptide identification program, 38 of these peptides were identified as deriving from one of eight Arabidopsis GSTs: AtGSTF2, AtGSTF6, AtGSTF7, AtGSTF8, AtGSTF9, AtGSTF10, AtGSTU19, or AtGSTU20 (Table I). At least three unique peptides were detected for each of these GSTs except for AtGSTU20, which was represented by a single peptide. Another 24 peptides were identified as being derived from Arabidopsis GSTs, but similarities among the members of this protein family prevented these peptides from being unequivocally assigned to a single GST. Consequently, these peptides were excluded from further analyses. For 22 peptides, the MS/MS spectra did not give a significant match with any protein in the data base (data not shown). Only one peptide (IQNGCSNVVSVDADSVVDGY) was identified that had a significant match to a protein other than an Arabidopsis GST. The function of this protein, encoded by gene At2g28540, is unknown and does not share significant sequence homology with any other characterized gene product. These results demonstrate that this technique can be used to identify GST proteins expressed in Arabidopsis seedlings and that GSH affinity chromatography provides an efficient method to reduce the complexity of protein samples, allowing for analysis focused on GSTs.Table 1Peptides identified in samples derived from untreated, copper-treated, and benoxacor-treated Arabidopsis seedlingsGSTm/zChargePeptide sequenceRelative expressionCopperBenoxacorGSTF2540.32LAFEQIFK2.611.11599.32VFGHPASIATR1.891.21757.73AIMAIGMQVEDHQFDPVASK5.021.26847.92YENQGTNLLQTDSK3.340.93959.43NISQYAIMAIGMQVEDHQFDPVASK2.461.151005.02SIYGLTTDEAVVAEEEAK4.880.891033.23YLAGETFTLTDLHHIPAIQYLLGTPTK3.281.14GSTF6780.42NVDFEFVHVELK5.211.25803.92AITQYIAHEFSDK3.701.07987.51GNNLLSTGK3.061.10GSTF7543.82GNQLVSLGSK11.751.07780.41YLASDK8.001.14794.42NLDFEFVHIELK10.22ND850.41EPFIFR9.671.25GSTF8677.31LAFER1.311.21759.42DLQFELIPVDMR1.521.40799.51VIDLQK1.380.92845.41VSEWIK1.261.141020.51VLATLYEK1.161.101159.02ATTNVWLQVEGQQFDPNASK1.271.27GSTF9752.32GVAFETIPVDLMK0.470.29799.92LAGVLDVYEAHLSK0.360.29970.51ALVTLIEK0.490.29992.83YLAGDFVSLADLAHLPFTDYLVGPIGK0.62NDGSTF10601.82IPVLVDGDYK0.790.71620.31YSLPV0.940.91737.82QPEYLAIQPFGK0.940.81747.42VLTIYAPLFASSK1.020.84831.52LAEVLDVYEAQLSK0.840.70942.51AVVTLVEK0.890.71GSTU19561.32VTEFVSELR1.566.24663.82NPILPSDPYLR1.736.13726.32FANFSIESEVPK1.845.74737.92SPLLLQMNPIHK1.486.12858.41KVWATK1.616.43873.42SLPDPEKND5.86961.51DFIEILK1.266.75GSTU20715.92SPLLLQSNPIHK0.770.50 Open table in a new tab Altered Expression of GSTs in Response to Copper and Benoxacor—The RNA expression of plant GSTs is influenced by many factors, but it is not known whether the expression of GST proteins parallels transcript accumulation under all these conditions. By combining MS-based analysis of peptides with differential isotopic labeling, it is possible to quantify changes in protein expression (19Regnier F. Amini A. Chakraborty A. Geng M. Ji J. Riggs L. Sioma C. Wang S. Zhang X. LC GC North America. 2001; 19: 200-213Google Scholar). In our experiments, GSH affinity-purified proteins were digested with trypsin and labeled with either acetate (control) or trideuteroacetate (treated) before being combined and analyzed by MS/MS. Because the labeling reaction targets primary amino groups, the amino terminus of every peptide was acetylated. In addition, if the peptide contained a lysine, this residue was labeled on its ϵ-amino group. Peptides that contain only a single amino-terminal primary amine appear in the mass spectrum as a pair of peaks, i.e. a doublet separated by three mass units, with one peak from the control sample and the other from the treated sample (Fig. 1, a and b). Singly charged peptides that also contain a lysine residue appear as doublets separated by six mass units; however, most peptides derived from Arabidopsis GSTs were ionized with two protons (i.e. doubly charged). Therefore, a lysine-containing doubly charged peptide appears as a doublet separated by three mass units (Fig. 1, c and d).Differences in expression between control and treated samples of specific GSTs were determined by comparing the relative abundance of the monoisotopic peaks of peptides derived from each protein. This technique was used to analyze the influence of copper and benoxacor on Arabidopsis GST protein expression. Specifically, two independent experiments were carried out by combining a control sample derived from untreated Arabidopsis seedlings with an experimental sample derived from either copper- or benoxacor-treated Arabidopsis seedlings; for example, the abundance of a peptide derived from AtGSTF7 was nearly 10-fold higher in copper-treated seedlings (Fig. 1a), whereas benoxacor had essentially no effect (Fig. 1b). In contrast, a peptide derived from AtGSTU19 was ∼6-fold more abundant in benoxacor-treated seedlings (Fig. 1d) but increased only 2-fold after copper treatment (Fig. 1c).With few exceptions, the peptides detected in samples from both copper- and benoxacor-treated seedlings were the same as those observed in control tissues. Therefore, GSTs that were not expressed under control conditions remained silent (or below the limit of detection of these experiments) after seedlings were treated with copper or benoxacor. The relative expression of each peptide in response to copper and benoxacor was calculated based on the monoisotopic peak intensities of each doublet (Table I). Seven of the eight GSTs that were expressed were represented by three or more peptides. Changes in protein expression of these seven GSTs were estimated by averaging the relative abundance of all peptides derived from each protein (Fig. 2). Individual peptides derived from the same GST generally showed very similar changes in abundance within a treatment, providing some internal validation of this approach.Fig. 2Induction of Arabidopsis GSTs in response to copper and benoxacor. Relative expression of GSTs in response to copper (gray bars) and benoxacor (black bars) were estimated by comparing peptide abundance from treated and untreated seedlings. Values are means and standard deviations of at least three unique peptides representing each GST. Data are displayed on a logarithmic scale. A value of 1 denotes a level of expression equal to that of the control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Copper increased the abundance of three GSTs by at least 3-fold, and AtGSTF7 was induced ∼10-fold. AtGSTU19 also was somewhat more abundant in copper-treated seedlings. In contrast, benoxacor strongly induced AtGSTU19, as previously documented (8DeRidder B.P. Dixon D.P. Beussman D.J. Edwards R. Goldsbrough P.B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1497-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), but no other GSTs were significantly more abundant after treatment with this herbicide safener. Neither copper nor benoxacor had a pronounced effect on expression of AtGSTF8 or AtGSTF10, but the abundance of AtGSTF9 was reduced more than 50% by both treatments. A similar reduction in abundance of AtGSTU20 was observed, although this was based on analysis of a single peptide derived from this protein (Table I).Immunoblot Analysis of AtGSTU19 and AtGSTF2—Proteomic analysis of Arabidopsis GSTs purified from copper- and benoxacor-treated seedlings demonstrated differential expression of several Arabidopsis GSTs including AtGSTU19 and AtGSTF2. To corroborate these data, immunoblot analyses were carried out using antibodies raised against recombinant forms of AtGSTU19 and AtGSTF2. AtGSTU19 protein expression was induced in response to benoxacor and to a lesser extent to copper, whereas AtGSTF2 expression was induced by copper but was unaffected by benoxacor (Fig. 3). Immunoblot analyses of the effects of copper and benoxacor on expression of AtGSTU19 and AtGSTF2 produced results similar to those obtained in the proteomic analyses described above. Anti-AtGSTF2 antibodies detected an additional protein with a slightly lower molecular weight than that of AtGSTF2 (Fig. 3). Similar results have been obtained previously (21Smith A.P. Nourizadeh S.D. Peer W.A. Xu J. Bandyopadhyay A. Murphy A.S. Goldsbrough P.B. Plant J. 2003; 36: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but the nature of this smaller protein has not been investigated further.Fig. 3Immunoblot analysis of AtGSTU19 and AtGSTF2 in copper- and benoxacor-treated Arabidopsis seedlings. Seven-day-old seedlings grown in a liquid medium were treated for 24 h with 50 μm CuSO4 or 100 μm benoxacor. Total soluble proteins were extracted, separated by SDS-PAGE (15 μg/lane), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with antiserum raised against recombinant AtGSTU19 (26.8 kDa) or AtGSTF2 (24.1 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of Arabidopsis GST RNAs in Response to Copper and Benoxacor—RNA"
https://openalex.org/W2056697180,"Conformational changes enable the photoreceptor rhodopsin to couple with and activate the G-protein transducin. Here we demonstrate a key interaction between these proteins occurs between the C terminus of the transducin α-subunit (GTα) and a hydrophobic cleft in the rhodopsin cytoplasmic face exposed during receptor activation. We mapped this interaction by labeling rhodopsin mutants with the fluorescent probe bimane and then assessed how binding of a peptide analogue of the GTα C terminus (containing a tryptophan quenching group) affected their fluorescence. From these and other assays, we conclude that the GTα C-terminal tail binds to the inner face of helix 6 in a retinal-linked manner. Further, we find that a “hydrophobic patch” comprising key residues in the exposed cleft is required for transducin binding/activation because it enhances the binding affinity for the GTα C-terminal tail, contributing up to 3 kcal/mol for this interaction. We speculate the hydrophobic interactions identified here may be important in other GPCR signaling systems, and our Trp/bimane fluorescence methodology may be generally useful for mapping sites of protein-protein interaction.

From these and other assays, we conclude that the GTα C-terminal tail binds to the inner face of helix 6 in a retinal-linked manner. Further, we find that a “hydrophobic patch” comprising key residues in the exposed cleft is required for transducin binding/activation because it enhances the binding affinity for the GTα C-terminal tail, contributing up to 3 kcal/mol for this interaction. We speculate the hydrophobic interactions identified here may be important in other GPCR signaling systems, and our Trp/bimane fluorescence methodology may be generally useful for mapping sites of protein-protein interaction. Visual signal transduction begins with light-induced structural changes in the photoreceptor rhodopsin. These changes convert this model G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; DM, n-dodecyl-β-maltoside; GT, heterotrimeric G-protein transducin; GTα, α-subunit of transducin G-protein; GTPγS, gaunosine 5′-3-O-(thio)tri-phosphate; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)-ehanesulfonic acid monohydrate; MII, metarhodopsin II; WT, wild type; PyMPO maleimide, 1-(2-maleimidylethyl)-4-(5-(4-methoxyphenyl)oxazol-2-yl)pyridinium methanesulfonate; PDT-bimane, 2-pyridyl)dithiobimane. into an active form (called MII), which couples with and activates the G-protein transducin, thus initiating the biochemical cascade that results in vision (1Okada T.

A key step in MII formation involves an outward movement of transmembrane helix 6 in the rhodopsin cytoplasmic face (5Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G.

We and others have hypothesized that helix 6 movement opens a cleft that provides a binding site for the transducin α subunit C-terminal tail (GTα C terminus) (7Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol.

Several lines of evidence show that the rhodopsin cytoplasmic face directly interacts with the GTα C terminus. For example, peptides and peptide analogues corresponding to the GTα C terminus can bind and stabilize MII rhodopsin (18Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hofmann K.P.

However, direct evidence for where and how the GTα C terminus and rhodopsin interact is lacking. In the present manuscript we set out to test whether the GTα C terminus binds to the cleft formed during rhodopsin activation through the use of a combination of site-directed labeling and fluorescence methods. Using these approaches, we were able to map where these regions interact by monitoring the tryptophan quenching of bimane fluorescence from modified cysteine residues on rhodopsin. Our results indicate that the GTα C-terminal tail does indeed bind to the inner face of helix 6, and we obtained evidence that critical hydrophobic contacts in this region control the affinity of the rhodopsin-transducin interaction, with key residues contributing up to 3 kcal/mol binding energy. We propose that the lack of these contacts is the underlying defect in several mutant rhodopsin proteins and speculate that the activation mechanism described and the hydrophobic interactions identified here may be universally important in other GPCR signaling systems.

The mutant rhodopsin proteins were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells using the DEAE-dextran method, and the cells were harvested 56-72 h after transfection as described previously (30Janz J.M. Fay J.F. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16982-16991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). After harvesting, the samples were regenerated with 11-cis-retinal and purified using immunoaffinity chromatography essentially as described previously (30Janz J.M. Fay J.F. Farrens D.L. J. Biol.

PDT-bimane Labeling of Rhodopsin Mutants and Determination of Labeling Efficiency—Labeling of samples with PDT-bimane and subsequent purification was carried out when the protein was bound to the 1D4 matrix as described previously for monobromobimane (7Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). After elution from the immunoaffinity column, a spectrum of each elution fraction was recorded (described below), and the purified samples were either used immediately or snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C. The amount of PDT-bimane label incorporation and the presence of unreacted free label were determined as follows (59Mansoor S.E. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling efficiency was determined by incubating the samples in the presence of 50 μm TCEP reducing agent at 4 °C for 10 min in buffer D followed by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid to each sample to precipitate the protein. The samples were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min in this mixture and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and fluorescence emission scans were carried out on both sets of supernatants using 380-nm excitation and monitoring emission from 410 to 605 nm. These data were then used to determine the concentration of PDT-bimane in each sample by comparison with a standard curve generated from serial dilutions of stock PDT-bimane. To determine the amount of free, unreacted label, the above procedure was carried out except the protein was first precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid, and any remaining signal was attributed to label not attached to the protein. UV-visible Absorption Spectroscopy—All of the UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer at 20 °C using a bandwidth of 2 nm, a response time of 1 s, and a scan speed of 500 nm/min unless otherwise noted. The concentration of protein was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient value (ϵ500) for WT rhodopsin of 40,600 M-1 cm-1 (40Wald G. Brown P.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1953; 37: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and the molar extinction coefficient (ϵ380) of PDT-bimane was 5000 M-1 cm-1. The samples were photobleached in buffer D by illumination for 30 s (at a 6-Hz flash rate) with a Machine Vision Strobe light source (EG&G) equipped with a >495-nm-wavelength long pass filter. This light treatment was found to be adequate for full conversion of all samples to the MII state. Measurement of the Rate of Retinal Release and/or MII Decay by Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The MII stability of the PDT-bimane-labeled mutants was assessed by monitoring the fluorescence increase of opsin during retinal release using a Photon Technologies QM-1 steady-state fluorescence spectrophotometer and standard instrument settings (39Janz J.M. Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7219-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 41Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Peptide Inhibition of MIII Formation—The ability to inhibit MIII formation was used to monitor peptide binding to each mutant rhodopsin. In these assays, the samples were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 μm peptide W23SV (in buffer D, pH 6.0) on ice for 10 min, and UV-visible spectra were recorded every 5 min from 650 to 250 nm at 10 °C. Following an initial dark state scan, the samples were photobleached to the MII state, and the effect of the peptide on MIII formation was monitored at 460 nm over time (see Fig. 2A). Instrument base-line drift was corrected for by setting the absorbance of all spectra to 0 at 650 nm. For comparison purposes duplicate experiments were performed on each sample in the absence of peptide (see Figs. 2B and 3A).Fig. 3Peptide W23SV binding and quenching properties of PDT-bimane-labeled rhodopsin mutants. A, peptide W23SV can bind to all PDT-bimane-labeled samples as indicated by its ability to inhibit MIII photoproduct. In the absence of peptide, the PDT-bimane-labeled mutants accumulates increasing amounts of the MIII photoproduct (460 nm) during decay of the active MII species (•, black), whereas preincubation of the samples with 100 μm W23SV peptide inhibits this process (▴, red). B, steady-state fluorescence emission spectra of MII PDT-bimane-labeled rhodopsin mutants (500 nM) in the absence (black) and presence (red) of 100 μm peptide W23SV. Notice the decrease in fluorescence intensity for C140B and K141B and to a lesser extent F228B upon addition of peptide W23SV. C, titration of MII PDT-bimane-labeled rhodopsin mutants (500 nM) with increasing amounts of peptide W23SV. Mutants C140B, K141B, and F228B exhibit dose-dependent saturation of PDT-bimane quenching, whereas no quenching is observed for the other mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Peptide Blocking of Rhodopsin Mutant V250C—The reactivity of rhodopsin mutant V250C toward the sulfhydryl-specific probe PyMPO maleimide was carried out as described previously (7Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 μg of mutant rhodopsin was reacted with 25-fold excess PyMPO for 1 min in Buffer F, pH 7.2, at 4 °C in either the dark state or following photobleaching (30 s) to the MII state. To test the ability of peptide W23SV to block PyMPO labeling of mutant V250C the sample was preincubated with 100-fold excess of peptide prior to photobleaching and to the addition of PyMPO. All of the reactions were quenched by the addition of L-cysteine to a 1 mm final concentration. The samples were subsequently resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and label incorporation was visualized using a Bio-Rad Gel Documentation Instrument. The background mutant θ (which contains no reactive cysteine residues) was used as a control to show PyMPO labeling specificity. Following label visualization, the gels were subjected to Coomassie staining to assure equal distribution of protein in each of the sample wells. KI Fluorescence Quenching Measurements—Steady-state fluorescence quenching measurements of V250B were carried out as described previously (7Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, 125 μl of a 250 nm sample was excited at 380 nm (0.25-nm bandpass setting), and emission was monitored from 405 to 605 nm (12-nm-bandpass setting). Five separate samples with KI concentrations ranging from 0 to 25 mm were measured in both the dark state and in the MII state following illumination with >490 nm light for 30 s. Separate samples were also measured in a similar manner following preincubation (10 min on ice) with 100 μm peptide W23SV. The salt concentration of each sample was kept constant at 25 mm by the addition of a corresponding amount of KCl, and Na2S2O3 was added to 0.10 mm to inhibit the formation of I3−. The resulting data were plotted as fluorescence intensity at 466 nm versus concentration of quenching agent (KI) to calculate the Stern-Volmer quenching constant, KSV, according to Equation 1 below. FoF=1+KSV·[Q(Eq. 1) Fluorescence Quenching of PDT-bimane-labeled Rhodopsin Samples by Peptide W23SV—Unless noted otherwise, the steady-state fluorescence measurements of PDT-bimane-labeled rhodopsin mutants were carried out at 10 °C using 500 nm sample in buffer D, pH 6.0. All of the spectra were buffer-subtracted and corrected for sample dilution when necessary. The fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 405 to 610 nm (15-nm bandpass) unless otherwise noted, while being excited at 380 nm (0.25-nm bandpass). Dark state spectra were recorded first, followed by photobleaching the sample to the MII state. Note that conversion to the MII state results in a large increase in fluorescence intensity from the labeled samples because of the shift in rhodopsin absorbance from 500 to 380 nm, which removes spectral overlap with PDT-bimane fluorescence, thereby relieving the quenching caused by energy transfer from the bimane to retinal. Peptide quenching experiments were performed by the addition of peptide in buffer D, pH 6.0, to MII rhodopsin to the desired concentration. In control experiments we find that the fluorescence intensity of the labeled samples in the MII state remains relatively constant throughout the short time course of the peptide quenching assays (data not shown). Additionally, less than 8% of the MII photointermediate decays over the time course of the assay. The data were acquired using the program Felix (Photon Technologies Inc.) and plotted using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific Software). Determination of Transducin (GT) Activation Rates—Activation of GT by rhodopsin was monitored using fluorescence spectroscopy at 10 °C, using described previously conditions (5Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 39Janz J.M. Farrens D.L.

Zvyaga T.A. Sakmar T.P. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15065-15073Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, this involved exciting the samples at 295 nm (2-nm bandwidth) and monitoring fluorescence emission at 340 nm (12-nm bandwidth). Photobleached mutant rhodopsin (see above) was added to a concentration of 5 nm to the reaction mixture consisting of 250 nm GT in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% DM, and the mixture was allowed to stir for 300 s. The reaction was then initiated by adding GTPγS to a final concentration of 5 μm, and the fluorescence increase was monitored for 2000 s. To calculate the initial activation rates, the slopes of the initial fluorescence increase following GTPγS addition were determined through the data points covering the first 60 s. Peptide Titration Assays and Calculation of EC50 and ΔΔG‡ Values—The EC50 values for quenching of PDT-bimane-labeled mutant rhodopsin samples by W23SV were determined by titrating the samples with increasing amounts of peptide. All of the experiments were performed at 10 °C to minimize the decay of the MII species. It was necessary to account for the decay of the MII species (t1/2 ≈ 38 min at 10 °C; see Table II) during the time course of the assay. Thus, the titration experiments were performed by splitting the samples in two and titrating each sample separately with different concentrations of peptide. In this manner dose-response curves were generated in less than 10 min, in which time less than 8% of the MII species had decayed. These peptide quenching data were combined and analyzed using nonlinear regression by fitting the data to a sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) equation (four-parameter logistic equation; see Equation 2 below) (20Aris L.

The ΔΔG‡ values for mutants K141B/226A, K141B/229A, and K141B/230A were calculated using the EC50 values to reflect binding Keq, and thus the ΔΔG‡ values were calculated according to Equation 3 below. ΔG‡=−RTlnKeq(Eq. 3) In Equation 3, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature, and Keq is the EC50 for peptide quenching. Peptide W23SV Binding Protects V250C on the Inner Face of Helix 6—Previously, we established that helix 6 movement in rhodopsin can be detected by two simple methods: through monitoring an increased reactivity of a cysteine residue introduced into the inner face of this helix at site Val250 and by monitoring the increased solvent accessibility of a fluorescent probe attached at this site (7Dunham T.D. Farrens D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1683-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Here we used these methods to probe the proposed GTα C terminus binding site in conjunction with a high affinity peptide analogue of the GTα C terminus. This peptide, W23SV (sequence WVLEDLKSVGLF), is a derivative of a peptide originally constructed by Hamm and coworkers (called 23S (19Martin E.L. Rens-Domiano S. Schatz P.J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol.

We determined the molecular mechanism by which insulin regulates Na+,K+-ATPase in differentiated primary human skeletal muscle cells (HSMCs). Insulin action on Na+,K+-ATPase was dependent on ERK1/2 in HSMCs. Sequence analysis of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunits revealed several potential ERK phosphorylation sites. Insulin increased ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake and [3H]ouabain binding in intact cells. Insulin also increased phosphorylation and plasma membrane content of the Na+,K+-ATPase α1- and α2-subunits. Insulin-stimulated Na+,K+-ATPase activation, phosphorylation, and translocation of α-subunits to the plasma membrane were abolished by 20 μm PD98059, which is an inhibitor of MEK1/2, an upstream kinase of ERK1/2. Furthermore, inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (100 nm wortmannin) and protein kinase C (10 μm GF109203X) had similar effects. Notably, insulin-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation was abolished by wortmannin and GF109203X in HSMCs. Insulin also stimulated phosphorylation of α1- and α2-subunits on Thr-Pro amino acid motifs, which form specific ERK substrates. Furthermore, recombinant ERK1 and -2 kinases were able to phosphorylate α-subunit of purified human Na+,K+-ATPase in vitro. In conclusion, insulin stimulates Na+,K+-ATPase activity and translocation to plasma membrane in HSMCs via phosphorylation of the α-subunits by ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase.

In conclusion, insulin stimulates Na+,K+-ATPase activity and translocation to plasma membrane in HSMCs via phosphorylation of the α-subunits by ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Na+,K+-ATPase is a plasma membrane cation pump that is essential for maintenance of intracellular and extracellular sodium and potassium concentrations, cell volume, osmotic balance, and electrochemical gradients (1Lingrel J. Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ewart H.S. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C295-C311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of Na,K-ATPase can be achieved by multiple mechanisms, including changes in intrinsic activity, subcellular distribution, and cellular abundance (3Feraille E. Doucet A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 345-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 4Sweeney G. Klip A. Mol Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 5Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F633-F650PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase is a substrate for protein kinases (2Ewart H.S. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C295-C311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Feraille E. Doucet A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 345-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 5Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F633-F650PubMed Google Scholar), and the pump phosphorylation is an important molecular mechanism for the short term control of its activity in response to hormonal stimulation (3Feraille E. Doucet A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 345-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle contains one of the largest pools of Na+,K+-ATPase in the body (6Clausen T. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1996; 156: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), expressing α-(α1 and α2) and β-(β1 and β2) subunits (4Sweeney G. Klip A. Mol Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 7Hundal H.S. Marette A. Ramlal T. Liu Z. Klip A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The α1-subunit isoform is mainly located in the sarcolemma, whereas the α2-subunit isoform is found both in the sarcolemma and diffusely distributed in the muscle fibers while preferentially located along the t-tubules (4Sweeney G. Klip A. Mol Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Dombrowski L. Roy D. Marcotte B. Marette A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E667-E676PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin plays a major role in mediating muscle K+-uptake to control the plasma K+ concentration (9McDonough A.A. Thompson C.B. Youn J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F967-F974Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) via regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity (4Sweeney G. Klip A. Mol Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Physiologically diverse roles for the α1- and α2-subunits have been highlighted using animal models whereby the isoform expression in skeletal muscle has been genetically altered (10He S. Shelly D.A. Moseley A.E. James P.F. James J.H. Paul R.J. Lingrel J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: R917-R925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle membrane fractions isolated by differential centrifugation, insulin increases α2-subunit abundance in the plasma membrane fraction, with no change in α1-distribution (11Hundal H.S. Marette A. Mitsumoto Y. Ramlal T. Blostein R. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5040-5043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this evidence, the α-subunits were hypothesized to serve specific functions: the α1-subunit isoform was proposed to have a “housekeeping” function in maintaining basic ion transport, and the α2-isoform was thought to be hormonally regulated. However, using alternative techniques for monitoring protein trafficking, the α1-subunit has been shown to undergo a similar hormone-sensitive translocation to the plasma membrane in various tissues. Insulin promotes translocation of an exofacially epitope-tagged rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit to the plasma membrane in HEK-293 cells (12Sweeney G. Niu W. Canfield V.A. Levenson R. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1797-C1803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition both cAMP and aldosterone induce translocation of α1-isoform in rat cortical collecting duct cells (13Gonin S. Deschenes G. Roger F. Bens M. Martin P.-Y. Carpentier J.-L. Vandewalle A. Doucet A. Feraille E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we revealed that insulin induces not only Na+,K+-ATPase α2- but also α1-subunit translocation to the cell surface in skeletal muscle (14Al-Khalili L. Yu M. Chibalin A.V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, a common mechanism of insulin regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase distribution, irrespective of structural difference between the α1- and α2-subunits, should exist. The mechanisms for regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity are believed to be similar between humans and rodents, however species differences (5Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F633-F650PubMed Google Scholar, 15Beguin P. Peitsch M.C. Geering K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14098-14108Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in the structure of Na+,K+-ATPase must be considered, especially in regard to the role of PKC. 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; FBS, fetal bovine serum; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HSMC, human skeletal muscle cell; MEK, ERK kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; NHE1, Na+/H+-exchanger 1. Historically, rodent Na+,K+-ATPase has been studied, and results have been extrapolated to humans. PKC has been heavily implicated in insulin-induced stimulation of Na+,K+-ATPase (14Al-Khalili L. Yu M. Chibalin A.V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Chibalin A.V. Kovalenko M.V. Ryder J.W. Feraille E. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zierath J.R.

Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1199-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Ser23, plays an important role in regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity and membrane trafficking (18Chibalin A.V. Katz A.I. Berggren P.O. Bertorello A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1458-C1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chibalin A.V. Pedemonte C.H. Katz A.I. Feraille E. Berggren P.O. Bertorello A.M. J. Biol.

Bertorello A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1920-1927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, the human α-subunit lacks Ser23, highlighting important species differences in the regulation of the pump. In vitro phosphorylation of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing N-terminal of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit indicate that rat α2 and human α1 are poor substrates for PKC (15Beguin P. Peitsch M.C. Geering K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14098-14108Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, insulin stimulates α-subunit phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (16Chibalin A.V. Kovalenko M.V. Ryder J.W. Feraille E. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zierath J.R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3474-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Feraille E. Carranza M.L. Gonin S. Beguin P. Pedemonte C. Rousselot M. Caverzasio J. Geering K. Martin P.Y. Favre H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2847-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These observations implicate a role for unidentified serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases in insulin activation of Na+,K+-ATPase in humans. We hypothesized that one of these unidentified kinases may be ERK1/2 MAP kinase. Several recent reports implicate MAP kinase in the regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase. Activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway leads to an increase in synthesis of Na+,K+-ATPase subunits (22Upadhyay D. Lecuona E. Comellas A. Kamp D.W. Sznajder J.I. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 23Isenovic E.R. Jacobs D.B. Kedees M.H. Sha Q. Milivojevic N. Kawakami K. Gick G. Sowers J.R. Endocrinology. 2003; 145: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and short term stimulation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity (23Isenovic E.R. Jacobs D.B. Kedees M.H. Sha Q. Milivojevic N. Kawakami K. Gick G. Sowers J.R. Endocrinology. 2003; 145: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because ERK1/2 is activated in insulin-sensitive tissues, including skeletal muscle (24Widegren U. Ryder J.W. Zierath J.R. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2001; 172: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we explored whether ERK1/2 is involved in the regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase in response to insulin in human skeletal muscle cells. Moreover, we determined whether α1- and α2-subunits are direct targets for ERK1/2 MAP kinase. Antibodies and Reagents—Specific anti-α1-subunit monoclonal (25Pietrini G. Matteoli M. Banker G. Caplan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8414-8418Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and anti-α2-subunit monoclonal (26Urayama O. Shutt H. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8271-8280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) antibodies were obtained from Drs. M. Caplan (Yale University, New Haven, CT) and K. Sweadner (Massachusetts Central Hospital, Boston, MA). Immunoprecipitation of the total Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit was performed using the polyclonal antibody, anti-NK1, raised against purified rat kidney holoenzyme (16Chibalin A.V. Kovalenko M.V. Ryder J.W. Feraille E. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zierath J.R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3474-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The antibodies against a phospho-Thr-Pro motif and the anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (P-Thr202/Tyr204) were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Recombinant ERK1 and ERK2 kinases, recombinant PKCζ, and MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 were from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Charlottesville, VA). Kinase inhibitors PD98059, GF109203X, wortmannin, and purified rat brain PKC were from Calbiochem. Streptavidin-agarose beads and EZlink Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin were from Pierce. Cell culture media and reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Human insulin (Actrapid) was from Novo Nordisk AS (Copenhagen, Denmark). Me2SO (Calbiochem) was used as a solvent for the protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors. All other reagents were of analytical grade (Sigma).

Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar) (www.cbs.dtu.dk/databases/PhosphoBase). The statistical stringency criteria for predicted phosphorylation sites were set at high, medium, and low level according to the program's user recommendations. Subject Characteristics—Skeletal muscle biopsies (rectus abdominus) were obtained with the informed consent of the donors during scheduled abdominal surgery. Subjects (3 male and 3 female) had no known metabolic disorders. Mean age was 54.5 ± 6.5 years (body mass index of 26 ± 1.5 kg × m-2 and fasting blood glucose of 5.2 ± 0.3 mm). The Ethical Committee at the Karolinska Institute approved the study protocols. Cell Culture—Human skeletal muscle satellite cells were isolated from muscle biopsies and cultured as previously described (14Al-Khalili L. Yu M. Chibalin A.V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed on passages 3–4. To initiate differentiation into myotubes, Hams/F-10 media with 20% FBS was removed from cells, and DMEM containing 1% PeSt (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen)) and 4% FBS was added for 48 h. Medium was again changed to DMEM containing 1% PeSt and 2% FBS. Fusion and multinucleation of the cells was observed at day 3 after initiation of the differentiation protocol. Myoblasts were grown on 100-mm Petri dishes. At days 0–14 after differentiation, myotubes were serum-starved 16 h before use to reduce the basal level of insulin- and cytokine-dependent kinase activity. Human renal tubular cells were cultured from the unaffected outer cortex of renal tissue obtained from nondiabetic patients undergoing elective nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma, as previously described (31Rigler R. Pramanik A. Jonasson P. Kratz G. Jansson O.T. Nygren P.-A. Stahl S. Ekberg K. Johansson B.-L. Uhlen S. Uhlen M. Jornvall H. Wahren J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13318-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Cells from the second and third passages were used for purification of Na+,K+-ATPase. Cell Incubation—For the Na+,K+-ATPase activity assay, 6-day-differentiated myotubes were preincubated for 30 min either with 0.2% Me2SO or 20 μm PD98059 (MEK1 inhibitor), 1 μm or 10 μm GF109203X (PKC inhibitor), 100 nm wortmannin (PI 3-kinase inhibitor). After preexposure to Me2SO/inhibitors, cells were stimulated with insulin (100 nm) for 20 min. After treatment cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and harvested by scraping cells into ice-cold lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 135 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 μm okadaic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were lysed by repeated pipetting, and lysates were agitated for 60 min at 4 °C and subjected to centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce). Lysates were kept at -80 °C before subsequent Western blot analysis or immunoprecipitation with appropriate antibodies. Measurement of Ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ Uptake—Na+,K+-ATPase transport activity was measured as ouabain-sensitive uptake of 86Rb+, under conditions of initial rate, as previously described (13Gonin S. Deschenes G. Roger F. Bens M. Martin P.-Y. Carpentier J.-L. Vandewalle A. Doucet A. Feraille E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Myotubes (day 6) were grown on 6-well dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and were preincubated in serum-free DMEM without or with ouabain (0.2 mm) and kinase inhibitors for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, myotubes were incubated in the presence or absence of insulin (20 min) and/or inhibitors. Na+,K+-ATPase transport activity was determined after the addition of 50 μl of medium containing tracer amounts of 86RbCl (100 nCi/sample, Amersham Biosciences) for 5 min. Incubation was stopped by cooling on ice, and dishes were washed three times with an ice-cold washing solution containing 150 mm choline chloride, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm BaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were lysed in 750 μl of lysis buffer A, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. Protein content was determined in parallel using the BCA assay (Pierce). Ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake was calculated as the difference between the mean values measured in triplicate samples incubated without or with 0.2 mm ouabain. Data are expressed as percentage of control. Basal ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake was 3.1 ± 0.3 pmol of Rb per microgram of protein per minute. [3H]Ouabain Binding—Measurement of ouabain binding sites on cell surface of differentiated myotubes was performed with [3H]ouabain, as previously described (32Aydemir-Koksoy A. Allen J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1869-H1874Google Scholar). Myotubes, grown on 6-well dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were preincubated in serum-free DMEM in the presence or absence of insulin (20 min) and/or inhibitors. The myotubes were washed and incubated with [3H]ouabain-binding buffer (OBB, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25 μm [3H]ouabain (specific activity: 16.5 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.05 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 4 mm NaH2PO4, and 5 mm glucose). After 15 min of incubation in [3H]ouabain, plates were washed with [3H]ouabain-free OBB, cells were lysed in 750 μl of lysis buffer A, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. Protein content was determined in parallel using the BCA assay (Pierce). Unlabeled ouabain (1 mm) was used as background control for nonspecific binding. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the background control from [3H]ouabain. Data are expressed as percentage of control. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Myotubes (6-day) were preincubated in PBS in the absence or presence of insulin (20 min) and/or inhibitors and thereafter were exposed to EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) at a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml in PBS at 4 °C for 60 min with gentle shaking. Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described (14Al-Khalili L. Yu M. Chibalin A.V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After biotinylation, cells were harvested and lysed in ice-cold buffer A as described above, and cell lysates were subjected to streptavidin precipitation. After streptavidin precipitation, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with subsequent Western blot with appropriate antibodies. Metabolic Labeling of Myotubes with 32Pi—32Pi metabolic labeling was performed (16Chibalin A.V. Kovalenko M.V. Ryder J.W. Feraille E. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zierath J.R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3474-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) to investigate in vivo phosphorylation of α-subunits of Na+,K+-ATPase. Myotubes (day 6), growing on 100-mm dishes, were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM containing 32Pi (1 mCi/ml). Insulin and/or inhibitors were added during the last 20 or 50 min of incubation time, as described above. Incubation was terminated by cooling on ice. Myotubes were lysed in buffer A, and α-subunits were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-NK1 rabbit antibodies. The bead pellets were mixed with 60 μl of Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm dithiothreitol), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, MA). Phosphoproteins were analyzed using Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS-1800II (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Japan), and quantification was performed using the Image Gauge software, version 3.4 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Japan). In each experiment, the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the α-subunit was corrected for the amount of the protein detected by the Western blot analysis. The quantitative data is reported as percent of basal. Immunoprecipitation—Myotubes were lysed in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer A. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Aliquots of supernatant (300 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of polyclonal anti-NK1 rabbit antibodies or with 30 μl the anti-phospho-Thr-Pro mouse IgM. Immunoprecipitates were collected on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) or protein l-agarose (Sigma) beads, respectively. Beads were washed four times in lysis buffer A; twice in 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.0) and 0.5 m LiCl; once in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 0.15 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA; and once in 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Pellets were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Western Blot Analysis—Aliquots of cell lysate (30 μg of protein) or immunoprecipitates were re-suspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, MA), blocked with 7.5% nonfat milk, washed with TBST (10 mm Tris HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20), and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with an appropriate secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified by densitometry. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—The phosphorylated α-subunit was immunoprecipitated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes, and the 32P-labled Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunits were identified on the membrane by using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS-1800II and excised. Thereafter, the phosphorylated α-subunit was hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl and analyzed by two-dimensional high voltage electrophoresis on cellulose thin layer plates. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described previously (33Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acids, on thin-layer electrophoresis plates, were analyzed using the Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS-1800II. Na+,K+-ATPase Purification—Human renal tubular cells were grown until confluence, trypsinized, and harvested by centrifugation (160 × g for 10 min). Cells were washed three times by ice-cold PBS. The final cell pellet was resuspended in 10–15 volumes of imidazole-sucrose buffer (25 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.2) and homogenized by 20 strokes in glass-glass homogenizer on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged (9,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the pellet after this centrifugation are rehomogenized and centrifuged again (9,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The two supernatants were combined and centrifuged (190,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C). The pellet of crude membranes after this centrifugation was resuspended in the imidazole-sucrose buffer and was used as starting material for Na+,K+-ATPase purification as described (34Jorgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Rat Na+,K+-ATPase holoenzyme was purified from rat kidney cortex as described (34Jorgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Quality of purification was verified by SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel) following Coomassie Blue staining. Na+,K+-ATPase activity has previously been determined under Vmax conditions (19Chibalin A.V. Pedemonte C.H. Katz A.I. Feraille E. Berggren P.O. Bertorello A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8814-8819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In Vitro Phosphorylation of Na+,K+-ATPase α-Subunit by ERK or PKC—For in vitro phosphorylation, 5 μg of Na+,K+-ATPase protein preparation was resuspended in 40 μl of 1.5× phosphorylation media (final concentrations: 20 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 200 μm ouabain, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm CaCl2, in the absence or presence of 0.5% Triton X-100), followed by addition of 0.1 μg of PKC (Calbiochem) or 0.1 μg of ERK1 and 0.1 μg of ERK2 (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA). The phosphorylation reaction for both kinases was initiated by addition of 10 μl of ATP (final concentration of 0.1 mm containing 3 μCi/pmol [32P]ATP, Amersham Biosciences) and allowed to proceed for 1 h at 30 °C. In the case of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity measurement, the phosphorylation reaction was performed in phosphorylation media without NaF and ouabain; the final concentration of ATP was 0.5 mm. The total volume of phosphorylation sample was 60 μl. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer, or 12-μl aliquots were immediately used for determination of Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Samples for SDS-PAGE were incubated for 20 min at 56 °C, thereafter iodoacetamide was added to final concentration of 20 mm. The phosphorylated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes, and the 32P-labled Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunits were identified by using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS-1800II. Thereafter, PVDF membranes were subjected to Western blotting or to phosphoamino acid analysis. Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were performed using Student's t test. For multiple comparisons, one-way analysis of variance with Sheffe's correction was used. Significance was established at p < 0.05. In Silico Screen of Possible Phosphorylation Sites in Na+,K+-ATPase α-Subunit—To determine whether Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit is a potential target for protein kinases, activated by insulin, a computer-based screen for possible phosphorylation sequence motifs was performed. A phosphorylation motif scan of human α1-subunit was performed using a Scansite 2.0 program at high stringency level. This analysis revealed three possible phosphorylation sites: Ser491 as a possible site for calmodulin-dependent kinase II, Ser943 as possible site for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and Thr81 as a possible site for ERK. The high stringency level scan of human α2-subunit protein sequence suggested Thr414 as a possible site for Akt kinase, Ser936 (a homologue for Ser943 in α1-subunit) as a possible site for PKA, and Thr79 as a possible site for ERK. We chose to examine ERK1/2 as a candidate kinase for insulin-regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunits, because (a) both α1- and α2-subunit cell surface abundance is regulated by insulin and (b) ERK1/2 is known to be activated by insulin. The sequence scans of α1- and α2-subunits performed at a medium and low stringency level predicted Thr85, Thr86, Thr226, Ser228, Thr282, and Thr788, as possible ERK phosphorylation sites in the human α1-subunit, and homologue amino acid residues Thr83, Thr84, Thr224, Ser226, and Thr781 as possible ERK phosphorylation sites in the human α2-subunit, respectively. The prediction of ERK phosphorylation sites was independently confirmed by a different phosphorylation site prediction program (PhosphoBase2.0). Notably, the predicted ERK phosphorylation sites are conserved between human, rat, mouse, and chicken. Effect of Kinase Inhibitors on Insulin Stimulation of Ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ Uptake and [3H]Ouabain Binding—Incubation of myotubes with insulin increased ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake by 48% (p < 0.05). This effect was completely prevented by 20 μm PD98059, a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, 10 μm GF109203X, a PKC inhibitor, or 100 nm wortmannin, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor. Notably a lower concentration of GF109203X (1 μm) as reported by Martiny-Baron et al. (35Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M. Mischak H. Blumberg P. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1976719040,"Talin interactions with vinculin are essential for focal adhesions. Curiously, talin contains three noncontiguous vinculin binding sites (VBS) that can bind individually to the vinculin head (Vh) domain. Here we report the crystal structure of the human Vh·VBS1 complex, a validated model of the Vh·VBS2 structure, and biochemical studies that demonstrate that all of talin VBSs activate vinculin by provoking helical bundle conversion of the Vh domain, which displaces the vinculin tail (Vt) domain. Thus, helical bundle conversion is a structurally conserved response in talin-vinculin interactions. Furthermore, talin VBSs bind to Vh in a mutually exclusive manner but do differ in their affinity for Vh and in their ability to displace Vt, suggesting that the strengths of these interactions could lead to differences in signaling outcome. These findings support a model in which talin binds to and activates multiple vinculin molecules to provoke rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

Talin and vinculin are essential components and regulators of cell-matrix (focal adhesion) complexes where they direct the assembly and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (1Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Both talin and vinculin are critical for cell growth, morphogenesis, and cell migration during the differentiation and organization of tissues, and loss of either talin or vinculin in mice results in marked defects in focal adhesions and embryonic lethality (2Xu W. Baribault H. Adamson E.D. Development. 1998; 125: 327-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Priddle H. Hemmings L. Monkley S. Woods A. Patel B. Sutton D. Dunn G.A. Zicha D. Critchley D.R. J.

Furthermore, both talin and vinculin play important roles in pathophysiological scenarios, including wound healing, ischemia, apoptosis, and metastasis of cancer cells (4Steenbergen C. Hill M.L.

Focal adhesion signaling is initiated after the specific interactions of components of the extracellular matrix with the ectodomains of various integrin receptors, which are unique in their ability to direct both outside-in and inside-out signaling (8Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 9Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 10Ridley A.J.

Connections to the actin cytoskeleton are mediated in part by activation of focal adhesion kinase, which phosphorylates downstream substrates on tyrosine residues and which directly associates with paxillin, which is linked to the actin cytoskeleton via its interactions with vinculin (for reviews, see Refs. 11Turner C.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar and 12Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). In addition, there are direct interactions of the cytoplasmic domains of integrin receptors with components of the cytoskeleton. For example, an NPXY/F variant of the canonical phosphotyrosine binding domain of integrin receptors mediates its interaction with the FERM 1The abbreviations used are: FERM, four point one, ezrin, radixin, and moesin motif; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; VBS(s), vinculin binding site(s); VBS2e, VBS2-enhanced; Vh, vinculin head domain (residues 1-258); Vt, vinculin tail domain (residues 879-1066).

In turn, talin binds to vinculin through vinculin binding sites (VBSs) present in its central rod domain, and this interaction contributes to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (15Gilmore A.P. Wood C. Ohanian V. Jackson P. Patel B. Rees D.J.G. Hynes R.O. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Hemmings L. Rees D.J. Ohanian V. Bolton S.J.

J. 1999; 341: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Until recently it was thought that talin largely played a passive role in focal adhesions, as a scaffold protein that simply bridged integrin receptors to the F-actin cytoskeleton via its association with other actin-binding proteins, in particular vinculin (18Critchley D.R. Holt M.R. Barry S.T. Priddle H. Hemmings L. Norman J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 65: 79-99PubMed Google Scholar). However, binding of the talin FERM domain to the cytoplasmic tails of integrin receptors activates focal adhesion signaling pathways (13Calderwood D.A. Yan B. de Pereda J.M. Alvarez B.G. Fujioka Y.

For inside-out signaling this occurs through FERM-induced conformational changes in the receptor chains, which increase their affinities for ligands (19Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the talin FERM domain can also interact with and activate phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase-1γ (20Di Paolo G. Pellegrini L. Letinic K. Cestra G. Zoncu R. Voronov S. Chang S. Guo J.

Finally, the VBSs of talin have been shown to facilitate the in vitro binding of vinculin to F-actin (23Bass M.D. Patel B. Barsukov I.G. Fillingham I.J. Mason R. Smith B.J. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Vinculin contains a highly conserved head (Vh) domain (residues 1-258) that interacts, in an intramolecular fashion, with its tail (Vt) domain (residues 879-1066; 24Winkler J. Lunsdorf H. Jockusch B.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Gilmore A.P. Burridge K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11729-11734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This interaction is thought to hold vinculin in an inactive conformation because biochemical studies have demonstrated that binding of Vh with Vt masks cryptic binding sites for talin, α-actinin, and α-catenin to Vh, and for F-actin to Vt (25Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 27McGregor A. Blanchard A.D. Rowe A.J. Critchley D.R. Biochem.

Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Thus, vinculin activation is generally agreed to involve structural changes that sever the Vh-Vt interaction, yet the signals that disrupt these intramolecular contacts are still unresolved. The conventional model has suggested that these constraints are simply relieved by the binding of PI(4,5)P2 to the Vt domain (25Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), which can insert into acidic phospholipid bilayers (30Johnson R.P. Niggli V. Durrer P. Craig S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10211-10222Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Indeed, binding of PI(4,5)P2 changes the conformation of Vt, and this facilitates the in vitro interaction of Vt with F-actin (31Bakolitsa C. de Pereda J.M. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1999; 99: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and, by disrupting the Vh-Vt interaction, has been suggested to allow talin binding to Vh (25Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 31Bakolitsa C. de Pereda J.M. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1999; 99: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, other models are now equally plausible because talin VBS3 and the vinculin binding site of α-actinin can displace Vt from preexisting Vh·Vt complexes (32Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.J. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the crystal structure of the Vh·VBS3 complex established that talin VBS3 distorts the binding site for Vt in Vh from a distance, by provoking dramatic alterations in the structure and positions of the α-helices of the N-terminal helical bundle of Vh, by a process coined as helical bundle conversion (32Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.J. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A long-standing mystery in focal adhesion signaling is how the structural proteins of the actin cytoskeleton undergo such rapid changes in their localization and organization. One possible mediator is talin, which harbors three separate high affinity vinculin binding sites (VBS1, VBS2, and VBS3) that are located in its central rod domain (residues 607-636 (VBS1), 852-879 (VBS2), and 1944-1969 (VBS3); see Refs. 15Gilmore A.P. Wood C. Ohanian V. Jackson P. Patel B. Rees D.J.G. Hynes R.O. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Bass M.D. Smith B.J. Prigent S.A. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, and 23Bass M.D. Patel B. Barsukov I.G. Fillingham I.J. Mason R. Smith B.J. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Each of the talin VBSs have been predicted to form an amphipathic α-helix (17Bass M.D. Smith B.J. Prigent S.A. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and larger portions of talin containing these VBSs can bind individually to Vh (17Bass M.D. Smith B.J. Prigent S.A. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and act as competitive inhibitors that prevent the binding of Vt to Vh (23Bass M.D. Patel B. Barsukov I.G. Fillingham I.J. Mason R. Smith B.J. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, it was not known whether these interactions were indeed mediated by the refined sequences of talin VBSs. We reasoned that if all of the more highly defined VBSs of talin indeed bound to Vh in a mutually exclusive manner and each was individually capable of activating vinculin, this would allow one molecule of talin to activate three molecules of vinculin effectively, a scenario that would amplifying integrin signaling and promote rapid changes in the actin cytoskeleton. To test this hypothesis we assessed the ability of talin VBS1 and VBS2 to displace Vt from preexisting Vh·Vt complexes and solved the crystal structure of the Vh·VBS1 complex to 2.4 Å resolution. Vh·VBS1 Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—The His6-tagged human Vh (residues 1-258) and Vt (residues 879-1066) expression constructs and the purification of Vh and Vt proteins have been described previously (32Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.J. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Human talin VBS1 (residues 607-636) was synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography in our in-house facility. Native Vh·VBS1 crystals were obtained from conditions similar to those for Vh·VBS3 crystals (32Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.J. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These crystals belong to space group R32 with one heterodimer in the asymmetric unit, a solvent content of 59%, and a volume to mass ratio of 3.04 Å3/Da. The Vh·VBS1 crystals were cryoprotected in paratone oil. Vh·VBS1 x-ray data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source, SBC-CAT ID beamline. The Rmerge to 2.42 Å was 0.179 (0.485 in the 2.51-2.42 Å shell) with a completeness of 97.6% (80.8%), a redundancy of 18, and an average F2/σF2 of 8.3 (3 in the last shell; 33Rush C.L. Izard T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 945-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Vh·VBS1 Structure Determination and Refinement—The human Vh·VBS1 crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement using the Vh·VBS3 structure (32Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.J. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) as a search model in the program AmoRe (34Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 46: 619-620Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The VBS3 peptide was omitted from the model. An electron density map based on the phases from the molecular replacement solution immediately showed the position of the entire backbone and side chains of the C-terminal helical bundle of Vh but gave poor initial definition of the N-terminal helical bundle of Vh. The helices in this bundle were first placed manually and refined as rigid bodies and then improved by extensive rebuilding with the O interactive graphics program (35Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The final stages were the interactive model building of the VBS1 peptide, and of the α1-α2 loop, where the electron density was weaker in the 2.7 Å Vh·VBS3 structure (32Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.J. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The calculation of σA-weighted 2Fo - Fc maps and the restrained refinement of positions and B-factors were carried out with BUSTER/TNT (36Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 361-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 37Tronrud D.E. Eyck L.F.T. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) allowed further improvements in the model. A Ramachandran plot analysis by the program PROCHECK (38Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

This structure analysis also showed that all stereochemical parameters are better than expected at the given resolution (see Table II).Table IIVh-VBS1 crystallographic refinement statisticsResolution range80.0-2.42 ÅLast shell2.57-2.42 ÅNo. of reflections (working set)14,289No. of reflections (test set)771R-factoraR−factor=∑hkl||Fobs|−⟨|Fcalc|⟩|∑hkl|Fobs| is the expectation of |Fcalc| under the error model used in maximum likelihood refinement.

Open table in a new tab Talin VBS Binding Assays—0.26 nm Vh and 0.52 nm Vt were incubated for 20 min at room temperature to form the Vh·Vt complex. Talin VBS1, VBS2, and VBS2e peptides were then titrated into the sample at molar ratios ranging from 0 to 5:1 and allowed to incubate for 20 min. Complexes were then analyzed by native PAGE. Binding of Talin VBS1, VBS2, VBS2e, and VBS3 to Vh—Binding studies were performed on a Biacore 3000 surface plasmon resonance (SPR) instrument. Vh was covalently attached to a carboxymethyldextran-coated gold surface (CM-5 chip, Biacore). The carboxymethyl groups on the chip were activated with EDC and N-hydroxysuccinimide to form the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of carboxymethyldextran. Vh was attached at pH 5.0 to this activated surface by reaction of the carboxyl groups of dextran with the primary amines of Vh to form an amide linkage. Any remaining reactive sites on the surface were blocked by reaction with ethanolamine. A reference cell was prepared similarly except that no Vh was added. Binding was measured by flowing the VBS peptides in 20 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol at a flow rate of 20 μl/min through the reference and Vh-containing flow cells in sequence. A blank was also run consisting of only buffer. After the injection, release of the bound VBS peptides was measured by flowing only buffer through the flow cells. Regeneration of the chip surface to remove bound VBS peptides was accomplished by injecting 20 μl of 10 mm glycine, pH 1.5, through the flow cells followed by a 7-min equilibration in buffer. Data reported are the difference in SPR signal between the flow cell containing Vh and the reference cell. Any contribution to the signal was removed by subtraction of the blank (buffer) injection from the reference-subtracted signal. Structure of the Human Vh·VBS1 Complex—The structure of the Vh domain in its inactive conformation when complexed with Vt defined a two four-helical bundle structure linked by a long shared α-helix (α4) that is remarkably similar to the structure of the β-catenin-α-catenin complex (39Pokutta S. Weiss W.I. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the structure of the Vh·VBS3 complex revealed that VBS3 binding provoked remarkable changes in the N-terminal helical bundle of Vh (helices α1-α4), creating an entirely new five-helical bundle structure; hence the idiom, helical bundle conversion. In contrast, the structure of the C-terminal helical bundle of Vh (helices α4-α7) is essentially unchanged by binding of VBS3, suggesting that the C-terminal helical bundle of Vh functions as a rigid scaffold that allows the N-terminal helical bundle to bind to its various partners (32Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.J. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Talin is unique among the vinculin-binding partners because it harbors, curiously, three noncontiguous VBSs, VBS1 (residues 607-636), VBS2 (residues 852-879), and VBS3 (1944-1969; Refs 15Gilmore A.P.

Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Based upon their α-helical amphipathic nature (17Bass M.D. Smith B.J. Prigent S.A. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and in part from competition studies using larger portions of talin harboring VBS1 (residues 498-636; Ref. 23Bass M.D. Patel B. Barsukov I.G. Fillingham I.J. Mason R. Smith B.J. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we reasoned that VBS1 and VBS3 would have similar or overlapping binding sites in Vh and would share in their ability to trigger structural changes in the N-terminal helical bundle of Vh. As expected from the Vh·VBS3 structure (32Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.J. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and binding studies with VBS1 (498-636) (23Bass M.D. Patel B. Barsukov I.G. Fillingham I.J. Mason R. Smith B.J. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), in the Vh·VBS1 crystal structure one molecule of VBS1 binds to one molecule of Vh (Fig. 1A). Superimposition of the Vh·VBS1 structure with that of the inactive Vh·Vt complex established that VBS1 is very similar to VBS3 in its ability to activate vinculin. Specifically, insertion of the amphipathic α-helix of talin VBS1 between Vh helices α1 and α2 generates a totally new five-helical N-terminal bundle structure and stretches the loop linking Vh helices α1 and α2 by unwinding the first two helical turns of α1 which are present in the Vh·Vt structure (Fig. 1B). As in the Vh·VBS3 structure (32Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.J. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), all VBS1 interactions are restricted to the N-terminal helical bundle of Vh, with little effect on the structure of the C-terminal helical bundle (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, binding of either talin VBS1 or VBS3 has dramatic effects on the structure of the N-terminal helical bundle of Vh, yet leaves the structure of its C-terminal helical bundle essentially unchanged.Fig. 1Structure of the human talin Vh·VBS1 complex.A, stereo drawing of the Vh·VBS1 crystal structure. VBS1 (residues 607-631, of which 608-626 form an amphipathic α-helix) is shown in ball and stick representation (oxygen atoms, red; carbon, yellow; nitrogen, blue; sulfur, green). In all figures the N terminus of each helix is marked with a plus sign, and the C terminus of each helix is indicated with a minus sign, in agreement with the helix dipole moment. B, talin VBS1 provokes helical bundle conversion of the Vh domain of vinculin. A stereo drawing superimposition of the Vh·VBS1 structure (Vh, pink; VBS1, teal) onto the inactive Vh·Vt structure (Vh, yellow; Vt, gray) is shown. Movements and helical distortions (arrows) of helices α1 and α2 of the N-terminal helical bundle which occur upon activation of Vh by talin VBS1 are indicated. Helices H1-H5 of Vt are labeled. C, stereo view of the final 2Fo - Fc electron density map of talin VBS1 (white bonds) in contact with α1 and α2 of the vinculin head domain (pink bonds). For clarity, only a few residues are labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The shared similarities in the structures of the Vh·VBS1 and Vh·VBS3 complexes were striking (Fig. 2), especially because talin VBS1 and VBS3 share only 16% identity and 46% similarity (Fig. 3A and Ref. 17Bass M.D. Smith B.J. Prigent S.A. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This similarity in structure also occurs even though VBS3 has three additional ordered residues that add an extra turn to its N terminus and that VBS1 has six additional ordered residues on its C terminus which bend away at ∼40° from its position in the Vh·VBS3 structure. Nonetheless, the binding of VBS1 to Vh is similar to that of VBS3, where Van der Waals interactions between the hydrophobic face of VBS1 with the hydrophobic core of the N-terminal helical bundle of Vh (Fig. 1C and Table I) provoke dramatic changes in the structures of Vh helices α1, α2, and α4 (Fig. 1B). Therefore, like talin VBS3, talin VBS1 is remarkable in its ability to provoke helical bundle conversion of the N-terminal bundle of Vh. Further, the residues of Vh interacting with VBS1, and the position of the VBS1 amphipathic α-helix between Vh helices α1 and α2, indicate that talin VBS1 and VBS3 must bind to the N-terminal helical bundle of Vh in a mutually exclusive fashion.Fig. 3Model of the Vh·VBS2 complex.A, sequence alignment of the three human vinculin binding sites (VBS1, VBS2, and VBS3) of talin.

The NK lymphoma cell lines, YT and Lopez, also expressed high granzyme H levels. Unstimulated CD4+ and particularly CD8+ T cells expressed far lower levels of granzyme H than NK cells, and various agents that classically induce T cell activation, proliferation, and enhanced granzyme B expression failed to induce granzyme H expression in T cells. Also, granzyme H was not detected in NK T cells, monocytes, or neutrophils. There was a good correlation between mRNA and protein expression in cells that synthesize both granzymes B and H, suggesting that gzmH gene transcription is regulated similarly to gzmB. Overall, our data indicate that although the gzmB and gzmH genes are tightly linked, expression of the proteins is quite discordant in T and NK cells. The finding that granzyme H is frequently more abundant than granzyme B in NK cells is consistent with a role for granzyme H in complementing the pro-apoptotic function of granzyme B in human NK cells.

Bleackley R.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Trapani J.A. Smyth M.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Cytotoxic lymphocytes utilize two pathways for killing target cells, both of which require direct cell contact. The first pathway involves exocytosis of potent toxins from secretory granules stored in the effector cell cytoplasm, whereas the second is triggered by clustering of death receptors on the target cell membrane following interaction with their respective ligands (tumor necrosis factor superfamily members) expressed on the killer cell (1Barry M. Bleackley R.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Trapani J.A. Smyth M.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Cytotoxic granules contain two major types of toxin that co-operatively induce target cell apoptosis: granzymes (gzms), a family of serine proteases, and a pore-forming protein, perforin. The precise mechanism of gzm/perforin synergy has not been clarified; however, it is likely that gzms enter the target cell by endocytosis (3Motyka B. Korbutt G. Pinkoski M.J. Heibein J.A. Caputo A.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas perforin enables pro-apoptotic gzms access to their substrates in the target cell cytosol by destabilizing endosomes (5Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Gottlieb R. Babior B. Shah G.M. Bleackley R.C. Dixit V.M. Hanna W. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8604-8615Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The more traditionally held notion of perforin permitting access to the cytosol through plasma membrane pores may also apply in some circumstances (6Browne K.A. Blink E. Sutton V.R. Froelich C.J. Jans D.A. Trapani J.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8604-8615Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Gzms are closely related to one another structurally, and their genes are clustered in several loci on distinct chromosomes (7Smyth M.J. O'Connor M.D. Trapani J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In both humans and rodents, each locus encodes proteases with a single broad type of substrate cleavage. Gzms A and K are trypsin-like proteases (“tryptases”) that cleave proteins at basic residues, and their genes are linked on human chromosome 5 (8Baker E. Sayers T.J. Sutherland G.R. Smyth M.J. Immunogenetics. 1994; 40: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Gzm M preferentially cleaves at residues with long, uncharged side chains (Met, Leu), and its gene is closely linked to the neutrophil elastase gene on human chromosome 19 (9Smyth M.J. Sayers T.J. Wiltrout T. Powers J.C. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6195-6205PubMed Google Scholar). The genes for gzms B and H are located on chromosome 14, tightly linked with the gene encoding cathepsin G, another chymotrypsin-like protease (“chymase”) that, unlike the gzms, is expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage but not in lymphocytes (7Smyth M.J. O'Connor M.D. Trapani J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Haddad P. Jenne D. Tschopp J. Clement M.V. Mathieu-Mahul D. Sasportes M. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These three genes all map to within 60 kb of one another. Gzm B cleaves its substrates adjacent to acidic residues, particularly Asp (11Odake S. Kam C.M. Narasimhan L. Poe M. Blake J.T. Krahenbuhl O. Tschopp J. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2217-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and plays a central role in eliciting death of the target cell by perturbing mitochondria and activating caspases (12Sutton V.R. Davis J.E. Cancilla M. Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Sedelies K. Browne K.A. Trapani J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1403-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 13Sutton V.R. Wowk M.E. Cancilla M. Trapani J.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Its absence from the granules of lymphocytes from gene knockout mice slows the rate of target cell DNA damage (14Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). In the mouse, the gene for gzm B is tightly linked to at least four other granzyme genes predicted to code for functional chymases (gzms C-F); however, only one such chymase, gzm H, performs this function in humans (15Edwards K.M. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Trapani J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30468-30473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Gzm C is now known to possess an unusual type of pro-apoptotic activity characterized by mitochondrial swelling and disruption that does not require prior caspase activity (16Johnson H. Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Ley T.J. Blood. 2003; 101: 3093-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, no such evidence has yet come forward for human gzm H. We recently showed that recombinant gzm H expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells preferentially cleaves substrates with Phe or Tyr at the P1 position (15Edwards K.M. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Trapani J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30468-30473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Despite sharing this substrate specificity with mouse gzms C-F, gzm H has no direct structural equivalent in the mouse and appears to be a uniquely human protein. Gzm H has a very high amino acid identity (>90%) with many portions of the gzm B sequence, particularly near the amino terminus of the molecule (10Haddad P. Jenne D. Tschopp J. Clement M.V. Mathieu-Mahul D. Sasportes M. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) despite performing a distinct enzymic function. It has been inferred from the high degree of sequence similarity that the gzmH gene arose by duplication of part of the 5′ end of the gzmB gene (particularly exons 3 and 4) and fusion with the 3′ end of an another primordial serine protease gene (10Haddad P. Jenne D. Tschopp J. Clement M.V. Mathieu-Mahul D. Sasportes M. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The function of gzm H is unknown, and its study has been greatly hindered by a lack of reagents able to distinguish it from gzm B at the protein or mRNA levels. The cellular expression of gzm H has been reported in just one study that assessed gzm H mRNA expression in human T cells (10Haddad P. Jenne D. Tschopp J. Clement M.V. Mathieu-Mahul D. Sasportes M. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This study concluded that like gzm B, gzm H is expressed at high levels in activated T cells. However, in another study, a portion of the gzmH promoter was used to preferentially direct the transgenic expression of SV-40 T antigen to the mouse lymphoid compartment. The transgene was not activated in allo-stimulated cytotoxic T lymphocytes that expressed high levels of gzm B but was highly expressed in activated NK cells and in NK and NK/T cell tumors that arose in these animals (17MacIvor D.M. Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 963-973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the genes encoding cathepsin G and gzms B and H are very tightly linked, cathepsin G and gzm B have markedly different cellular expression profiles, as cathepsin G is expressed exclusively by cells of the myeloid lineage, particularly neutrophils and monocytes (18Hohn P.A. Popescu N.C. Hanson R.D. Salvesen G. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13412-13419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore quite feasible that gzms B and H may be differentially expressed and regulated among leukocyte subsets. The availability of correctly folded, proteolytically active gzm H enabled us to attempt raising monospecific reagents for this protease. Having produced a novel gzm H-specific mAb, we now demonstrate that gzm H is expressed solely in lymphocytes, but its constitutive expression pattern is quite distinct from that of gzm B, as is its expression in response to a variety of stimuli that strongly induce gzm B expression. Antibodies—Antibodies used in Western blotting and immunohistochemistry included several mAbs made by our laboratory: 2C5 (antigzm B) (19Trapani J.A. Browne K.A. Dawson M. Smyth M.J. Biochem.

Lysates of homogeneous populations of human T cell lymphoma samples of two unrelated individuals (derived from lymph node biopsies) were also analyzed. Immunohistochemical studies were performed as described previously (23Sayers T.J. Brooks A.D. Ward J.M. Hoshino T. Bere W.E. Wiegand G.W. Kelly J.M. Smyth M.J. Kelley J.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recombinant gzm Expression—Recombinant human gzm B and gzm H were purified from the culture supernatants of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, 3-5 days after infection, as described (15Edwards K.M. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Trapani J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30468-30473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The poly-histidine-tagged gzm proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography and dialyzed against PBS. The gzms were tested for their proteolytic activity by assaying the cleavage of tripeptide substrates Ala-Ala-Asp-S-benzyl (for gzm B, a kind gift from Drs. Chih-Min Kam and Jim Powers, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA) or Phe-Leu-Phe-S-benzyl (for gzm H, purchased from Sigma). mAb Production and Screening—Five- to -seven-week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized into the peritoneal cavity with purified, recombinant gzm H (50 μg) mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant. Two to four weeks later, the mice were boosted with the same antigen mixed with incomplete adjuvant. Three days following a further similar immunization, a mouse was sacrificed, and its spleen cells were fused with NS-1 mouse myeloma cells, using polyethylene glycol. Ten days later, hybridomas were screened for secretion of anti-gzm H mAbs using a solid phase ELISA assay in which gzm H (or gzm B as a control) was coated onto the wells of a 96-well polyvinyl chloride plate. Positive hybridomas were cloned by limiting dilution, and the clones were expanded and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. Production of a Rabbit Polyclonal Antiserum—Polyclonal antiserum was raised in New Zealand White rabbits by immunization with purified recombinant human gzm B (200 μg) mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant and injected into multiple sites subcutaneously in volumes of <0.1 ml. Three booster immunizations were given intramuscularly with incomplete adjuvant at 3-4-week intervals. Isolation of Leukocyte Subsets—For isolation of neutrophils, cell pellets collected after Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation were dispersed in PBS containing 3% dextran and left to stand at ambient temperature for 30 min to rouleau the red cells. Neutrophils were then pelleted from the supernatants and resuspended in hypotonic buffer containing 0.2% NaCl for 1.5-2.0 min to lyse the remaining red cells. The tonicity was then adjusted to 0.9% NaCl, and the cells were again pelleted and washed. Cells were >95% neutrophils, by Giemsa staining. Monocytes were sorted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with anti-CD14 fluorescein isothiocyanate and were at least 82% pure. CD3+CD56- T cells and CD3-CD56+ NK cells were purified from PBMC by fluorescence-activated cell sorter sorting and were reproducibly >96% pure. For isolation of NKT cells, PBMC were cultured in medium containing IL-2, IL-7, and α-galactosylceramide (generously provided by Kirin Breweries, Gunma, Japan) for 7 days. Cells that stained positive with phytohemagglutinin-conjugated CD1d/a-galactosylceramide tetramer (generously provided by Drs Stephané Sidobre and Mitchell Kronenberg, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, CA) and CD3-fluorescein isothiocyanate were collected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter sorting, and purity was found to be 95%. T and NK Cell Stimulation—Human PBMC and purified populations of T and NK cells were incubated in medium supplemented with recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2, 100-500 units/ml; Chiron Corp.) and/or phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (2 μg/ml) or anti-CD3 mAb HIT3A (10 ng/ml; Pharmingen) for up to 10 days prior to harvest and analysis for gzm expression. Protein Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were fractionated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Nonspecific protein binding was blocked by preincubation with 5% nonfat skim milk in PBS at 4°C for 2 h. Membranes were incubated with mAb (hybridoma culture supernatant, typically diluted 1/5 to 1/20 in PBS) at 4°C overnight and washed, and then bound Ig was detected with goat anti-mouse Ig conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Generation of gzm-specific cDNA Probes Northern Blotting, and Real-time PCR Analysis—cDNA probes specific for the 3′-untranslated regions of gzm B and H mRNA/cDNA were produced by PCR amplification of each respective cDNA clone, using synthetic oligonucleotide primers. The gzm B probe was amplified using the oligonucleotides 5′-GAAACGCTACTAACTACAGG-3′ and 5′-CCACTCAGCTAAGAGGT-3′ and was 129 nucleotides in length. The gzm H probe was similarly amplified using the oligonucleotides 5′-AGAACAATGAAGCGCCTC-3′ and 5 ′-ACACGCGGCCGCGATCCATTTATTACAGTCC-3′ and was 138 nucleotides in length. Each probe was purified from 2% agarose gels and labeled with [α-32P]dATP by nick translation or random priming with synthetic hexanucleotides. The radiolabeled probes were used to identify gzm-specific mRNA in Northern blot experiments. Total cellular RNA was isolated from various populations of human cells and cell lines (10 μg/lane) and separated by electrophoresis on 1% formaldehyde/agarose gels and then transferred to nylon membranes by capillary transfer. The membrane was allowed to dry at room temperature and then baked at 80°C for 2 h. Prehybridization was in buffer containing 50% formamide, 1% SDS, and 5× SSC (pH 6.8) solution at 42°C. Following hybridization with preboiled radiolabeled cDNA probe for 16 h, the filters were washed at low stringency and then under high stringency conditions (0.1× SSC, 1% SDS, 60°C for 2 × 20 min), air-dried, and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) for 1-3 days at -80°C. In some experiments, plasmid DNA was spotted onto nylon membranes (50 ng/spot) and then denatured in NaOH. The membranes were baked at 80°C for 2 h and then prehybridized and hybridized as described above. For real-time-PCR, 2 μg of DNase-treated RNA was reverse transcribed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase Rnase H minus, point mutant (Promega). PCR primers for each gene were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with a melting temperature at 58-60°C and a resulting product of 75-150 bp. Triplicate 20-μl PCR reactions were carried out using SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems), initially for 15 min at 95°C followed by 39 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 60 s in the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system. The levels of gzm H and B mRNA were normalized to that of ribosomal protein L32. Primer pairs were as follows: L32, forward, 5′-TTCCTGGTCCACAACGTCAAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TGTGAGCGATCTCGGCAC-3′; gzm B, forward, 5′-GCGGTGGCTTCCTGATACAAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCCCCAAGGTGACATTTATGG-3′; gzm H, forward, 5′-TGGCGGCATCCTAGTGAGAA-3′, and reverse 5′-GCCCCCAAGGTGACATTTATG-3′. Primer efficiency for gzms B and H was demonstrated by the overlapping amplification profiles of equal quantities of gzm B and H cDNA. Granule Fractionation—For cell fractionation experiments, YT human NK tumor cells (3 × 108) were harvested, washed several times in PBS, and lysed by nitrogen cavitation, as described (24S. V., Davis J.E. Browne K.A. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; Google Scholar). The cell lysate was fractionated on a continuous Percoll density gradient as described, and 1-ml fractions were collected, starting with the dense (bottom) end of the gradient. Following the removal of Percoll by ultracentrifugation, aliquots of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. To determine the cellular and subcellular expression of gzm H, it was first necessary to produce an antiserum that could distinguish it from other granzymes, particularly its closest structural relative gzm B, with which it shares ∼75% amino acid identity (25Klein J.L. Selvakumar A. Trapani J.A. Dupont B. Tissue Antigens. 1990; 35: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have previously expressed and purified catalytically active gzm H secreted by baculovirus-infected insect cells (15Edwards K.M. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Trapani J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30468-30473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), so this protein was used as an immunogen for mAb production in BALB/c mice. Of 800 hybridoma culture supernatants screened for mAb secretion in a solid phase ELISA assay, 48 were found to secrete an Ig that bound to gzm H. All but one of these mAbs produced an equivalent signal when tested on purified gzm B, indicating they detected an epitope common to both granzymes (data not shown). However, the mAb produced by hybridoma 4G5 specifically recognized gzm H and failed to react with gzm B in the ELISA assay (Fig. 1A). Conversely, mAb 2C5, which we have used extensively in studies on gzm B (12Sutton V.R. Davis J.E. Cancilla M. Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Sedelies K. Browne K.A. Trapani J.A. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 5783-5790PubMed Google Scholar), was specific for gzm B and failed to recognize gzm H. MAb 4G5 detected as little as 3 ng of gzm H but did not react at all with gzm B in Western blots (Fig. 1B). In the reciprocal experiment, mAb 2C5 reacted strongly with gzm B in Western blots but did not react with gzm H (data not shown). By contrast with both mAbs, a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against gzm B showed strong cross-reactivity with gzm H, once again demonstrating the close structural similarity of the two granzymes (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, mAb GB7, a commercially available reagent purported to specifically detect gzmB, produced an equivalent signal with gzms B and H (Fig. 1C). Similar analyses using other recombinant granzymes also demonstrated that both 4G5 and 2C5 did not react with recombinant human gzm M, a more distant relative of gzms B and H (∼35% amino acid identity; data not shown) (7Smyth M.J. O'Connor M.D. Trapani J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Having shown that 4G5 specifically detects gzm H, we next used the mAb in Western blotting on whole cell lysates made from a series of hemopoietic and non-hemopoietic cells lines. The human NK leukemia cell lines YT (Fig. 2) and Lopez (data not shown) both demonstrated a 33-kDa protein that co-migrated with recombinant gzmH. The predicted molecular mass on reduced SDS-PAGE was consistent with a gzm H polypeptide backbone of 26 kDa (deduced from the cDNA sequence) and ∼7 kDa of added carbohydrate. Gzm H was not expressed by the acute T cell leukemia lines Jurkat and CEM, the B lymphoma cell lines Daudi and Raji, the myeloid cell lines HL-60 and U937, or cells from two lymph node biopsies excised from patients with disseminated T cell lymphoma. Similarly, no signal was detectable in the human carcinoma cell lines 293 (embryonal kidney), HeLa (cervical), or the adenocarcinomas Lovo, COLO 205, and MDA-MB435. As Lopez and YT cells both contain large numbers of cytolytic granules and also express perforin and gzms B and M (24S. V., Davis J.E. Browne K.A. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; Google Scholar), the co-expression of gzm H by these cells lines was consistent with a possible role for gzm H in cytotoxic granule-mediated cell death. To determine the subcellular localization of gzm H, we initially performed immunohistochemistry on pelleted YT cells, using mAbs 2C5 (anti-gzmB) and 4H10 (anti-gzmM) as controls (Fig. 3A). As was shown previously, gzms B and M were localized to granules in the cytoplasm of YT cells (20Smyth M.J. O'Connor M.D. Kelly J.M. Ganesvaran P. Thia K.Y. Trapani J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Sun J. Bird C.H. Sutton V. McDonald L. Coughlin P.B. De Jong T.A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27802-27809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic staining in YT cells was also observed with the gzmH mAb; however, the strength of the staining varied considerably from cell to cell: some YT cells (about 50%) stained strongly, a minority stained weakly, and the remainder (about 25%) showed no staining. The heterogeneity of staining was not due to limiting Ig, as similar numbers of strongly and weakly staining cells were observed over a range of antiserum concentrations (data not shown). None of the granzyme mAbs bound to Jurkat cells, which were used as a negative control in this experiment (Fig. 2). To definitively demonstrate gzmH localization to cytotoxic granules, a lysate of mechanically disrupted YT cells was fractionated on a Percoll density gradient (Fig. 3B). The fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies specific for gzms B and H, perforin, and the serpin, PI-9, which is localized to the cytosol of cytotoxic lymphocytes rather than granules (26Sun J. Bird C.H. Sutton V. McDonald L. Coughlin P.B. De Jong T.A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27802-27809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Gzm H was co-localized with the granule proteins perforin and gzmB in fractions 6-8 at the dense end of the gradient (specific gravity 1.10-1.13 g/ml, data not shown). Fractions 6-8 were free of PI-9, which is abundant in the cytosol of YT cells (represented by the least dense fractions, 14-18) but is not a significant constituent of the granules (26Sun J. Bird C.H. Sutton V. McDonald L. Coughlin P.B. De Jong T.A. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27802-27809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Almost all of the human and rodent granzymes described to date are expressed constitutively by NK cells and in an inducible manner by CD8+ (and some CD4+) T cells, when they become activated and adopt an effector phenotype (28Trapani J.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 182: 111-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two granzymes known to play a pivotal role in target cell apoptosis, gzm B, which is encoded by a gene that is very tightly linked to that of gzm H, and gzm A, encoded on a different chromosome, Chr 5 (8Baker E. Sayers T.J. Sutherland G.R. Smyth M.J. Immunogenetics. 1994; 40: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) are both regulated in this way. One exception to this general “rule” is gzm M, which is constitutively expressed by NK cells but not by human or rodent T cells when they become activated (20Smyth M.J. O'Connor M.D. Kelly J.M. Ganesvaran P. Thia K.Y. Trapani J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Sayers T.J. Brooks A.D. Ward J.M. Hoshino T. Bere W.E. Wiegand G.W. Kelly J.M. Smyth M.J. Kelley J.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to determine which leukocyte subsets (if any) in normal human peripheral blood express gzmH, both in their quiescent state or following exposure to activating stimuli. Initially, we subjected unfractionated PBMC from normal individuals to Western blotting, either prior to or after exposure to agents that cause T cell activation and proliferation in vitro (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, freshly isolated, unstimulated PBMC from unrelated donors showed strong constitutive gzm H expression, whereas the expression of gzm B by the same cells was very low or absent (Fig. 4A). From past studies, gzmB is known to be expressed at low levels in unstimulated NK cells (23Sayers T.J. Brooks A.D. Ward J.M. Hoshino T. Bere W.E. Wiegand G.W. Kelly J.M. Smyth M.J. Kelley J.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and is induced from very low levels in stimulated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (10Haddad P. Jenne D. Tschopp J. Clement M.V.

Even though the p38 MAP kinase and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) are involved in TGF-β1-induced cell death in hepatoma cells, the upstream mediators of these kinases remain to be defined. We show here that the members of the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) family (including MLK1, MLK2, MLK3, and dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase (DLK)) are expressed in FaO rat hepatoma cells and are likely to act between p38 and TGF-β receptor kinase in death signaling. TGF-β1 treatment leads to an increase in MLK3 activity. Overexpression of MLK3 enhances TGF-β1-induced apoptotic death in FaO cells and Hep3B human hepatoma cells, whereas expression of the dominant-negative forms of MLK3 suppresses cell death induced by TGF-β1. The dominant-negative forms of MLK1 and -2 also suppress TGF-β1-induced cell death. In MLK3-overexpressing cells, ERK, JNKs, and p38 MAP kinases were further activated in response to TGF-β1 compared with the control cells. In contrast, overexpression of the dominant-negative MLK3 resulted in suppression of TGF-β1-induced MAP kinase activation and TGF-β1-induced caspase-3 activation.

Studies show that members of the Rho family of GTPases, Rac and Cdc42, have been found to bind to and to modulate the activities of MLK2 and -3, and coexpression of MLK3 and activated Cdc42 leads to enhanced MLK3 activation (15Teramoto H.

Recent observations demonstrate that the overexpression of constitutively active forms of Rac1/Cdc42 promotes apoptotic death and that the dominant-negative forms of the pathway members block death (23Vacratsis P.O. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27893-27900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Studies on neuronal and other cell types indicate that the MLK family members are likely to act between Rac1/Cdc42 and MKK4 and -7 in death signaling. Overexpression of MLKs effectively induces apoptotic death of cultured neuronal PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons, whereas the expression of dominant-negative forms of MLKs suppresses death evoked by nerve growth factor deprivation or expression of activated forms of Rac1 and Cdc42. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are a group of protein serine/threonine kinases that are activated in response to a wide variety of external stress signals such as UV irradiation, heat shock, and many chemotherapeutic drugs and mediate signal transduction cascades that play an important regulatory role in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (24Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). During TGF-β1-induced apoptosis, three MAP kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 kinase) showed simultaneously sustained activation in FaO rat hepatoma cells (25Park H.J. Kim B.C. Kim S.-J. Choi K.S. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TGF-β1-induced apoptosis was markedly enhanced when ERK activation was selectively inhibited by the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059. In contrast, both interference with p38 activity by overexpression of the dominant-negative (DN) MKK6 mutant and inhibition of the JNK pathway by overexpression of the DN SEK1 mutant resulted in suppression of TGF-β1-induced apoptosis. Recently, it has been shown that ectopic expression of GADD45b in AML12 murine hepatocytes activates p38 and triggers apoptotic cell death, suggesting that GADD45b participates in TGF-β1-induced apoptosis by acting upstream of p38 activation. Because of the widespread role of MAP kinase activation in TGF-β1-induced cell death signaling in hepatoma cells, we carried out further studies to define the upstream activators of the MAP kinase pathway involved in TGF-β1-induced cell death signaling. Here, we show that MLKs are mediators of TGF-β1-induced cell death signaling in hepatoma cells. Reagents—The p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580, MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, and JNK inhibitor SP600125 were from Calbiochem. Phosphospecific antibodies for the active forms of p38, JNK, ERK, MLK3, ATF2, and c-Jun and antibody against cleaved caspase-3 (17 kDa) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against MLK3, MKK3/6, MKK4/6, p38, ERK, and JNK were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Dulbecco's minimal essential medium and Lipofectin were purchased from Invitrogen. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—Expression of MLK1, MLK2, MLK3, and DLK was determined by RT-PCR analysis. Total RNA was purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using TITANIUM one-step RT-PCR kit (Clontech). The following primers were used: MLK1, 5′-AACTACGTGACCCCGCGCA-3′ and 5′-CCGCAAAATCAATTTCTAAC-3′; MLK2, 5′-TGGAGCTGGAGAGCTTCAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CATGTCCATGTCCAGCAGTGTGG-3′; MLK3, 5′-GTCATGGAATGGCAGTGG-3′ and 5′-CACGGTCACCCTTCCTCA-3′; DLK, 5′-GAGGTAGACAGTGAAGTAGAGC-3′ and 5′-CCAATTCAGTGCTGTCACAGTC-3′; and cyclophilin, 5′-ATGGTCAACCCCACCGTGTT-3′ and 5′-CTGGTGAAGTCACCACCCT-3′. The identity of all PCR products was confirmed by sequencing. All RT-PCR assays were performed at least twice. Expression Constructs, Transfections, and Reporter Assays—Both DN and WT forms of MLK3 and DN forms of MLK1 and MLK2 were described previously (26Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the reporter assay, FaO cells and HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with SBE4-luc (27Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) and the internal control pCMV-β-gal in 6-well plates using Lipofectin. After 24-h transfection, cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h in medium. Luciferase activity was quantified by using an enhanced luciferase assay kit (BD Biosciences). Values were normalized with the β-galactosidase activity. All assays were performed in triplicate and represented as mean ± S.E. of three independent transfections. Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—FaO rat hepatoma cells and Hep3B cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (PSG; Invitrogen). For stable expression of DN and WT MLK3, FaO and Hep3B cells were co-transfected with pCMS-EGFP-WT or DN MLK3 expression plasmid and pcDNA expression plasmid. One day after transfection, cells were selected for neomycin resistance. After 2 weeks of selection, neomycin-resistant and fluorescence-positive colonies were isolated, expanded, and analyzed. Assessment of Cell Survival—In Hep3B cells, the number of healthy, nonapoptotic enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-positive cells in the same field was assessed. The percentage of surviving cells was calculated relative to the numbers present in control (without TGF-β1 treatment) wells. The numbers of transfected cells counted in control cultures were at least 200. In FaO cells, apoptotic cells were measured by trypan blue staining, and the percentage of surviving cells was calculated relative to the numbers of surviving cells versus apoptotic cells. Values are the means of counts on 3 wells ± S.E. Similar results were obtained in three additional independent experiments. Immunoblot Analysis—Whole-cell extracts were obtained in a radio-immune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science)). Extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, were probed with polyclonal or monoclonal antiserum, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG, respectively, and were visualized by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation the cell lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibody for 4 h, followed by incubation with GammaBind beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with the buffer used for cell solubilization. Immune complexes were then eluted by boiling for 3 min in 2× Laemmli buffer, and then extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Immune Complex Protein Kinase Assay—Kinases MKK3/6 and p38 and kinases MKK4/7 and JNK were immunoprecipitated from control cell lysates using the appropriate antibody, respectively. MLK3 was obtained from cell lysates that were harvested after incubation with or without TGF-β1 for the indicated times. Immunocomplexes were recovered with the aid of GammaBind beads and were washed twice with lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, twice with lysis buffer, and twice again with kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 25 mm α-glycerol phosphate). The MLK3 precipitates were mixed with MKK3/6 and p38 and with MKK4/7 and JNK, respectively. The kinase reaction was initiated by addition of 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of substrates. The activities of p38 were examined by using purified ATF2 as substrate, and the kinase activities of JNK were assayed with c-Jun as substrate. Following 15-min incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS loading buffer. Immunoblots were performed using antiphospho-ATF2 and antiphospho-c-Jun antibodies, respectively. MLK Family Members Are Expressed in FaO Rat Hepatoma Cells—RT-PCR was used to determine the expression of members of the MLK family in FaO cells. As shown in Fig. 1, transcripts for MLK1, MLK2, MLK3, and DLK were readily detectable in FaO cells. We did not observe the effects of TGF-β1 on expression of any of the analyzed genes. Phosphorylation of MLK3 and Activation of MLK3 Substrates in Response to TGF-β1 Treatment—We next addressed whether TGF-β1 treatment affects endogenous MLKs. We only examined MLK3 because of the quality of the available antibody. TGF-β1 treatment did not induce the level of endogenous MLK3 protein expression in FaO cells and Hep3B human hepatoma cells. Because there is evidence that MLK3 is activated by phosphorylation (12Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), we examined the phosphorylation of endogenous MLK3 induced by TGF-β1-induced apoptotic stimuli. The increase in MLK3 phosphorylation level was gradual, persistent, and apparent within 30 min of TGF-β1 treatment, with maximum activation occurring 8 h after TGF-β1 treatment and slowly declining to basal levels over 24 h in FaO cells (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, changes in phosphorylation levels were observed only in the fast migrating form. The phosphorylation of the more slowly migrating form was not modulated by the TGF-β1 stimulation. In Hep3B cells, we observed bimodal MLK3 phosphorylation in response to TGF-β1 (Fig. 2b). The primary peak of MLK3 phosphorylation was rapid and transient, peaking at 30 min, followed by a decline toward base-line values by 4 h. The primary peak of MLK3 phosphorylation was followed by a gradually rising, sustained secondary peak, maximal between 12 and 24 h. We next determined the activation of the downstream substrates, c-Jun and ATF2, of both p38 and JNK in cell extracts by in vitro kinase assays in FaO cells (Fig. 2, c and d). The timing of the maximum activation of time-dependent phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF2 coincided well with that of maximum MLK3 activation. Expression of MLK3 Enhances TGF-β1-induced Apoptosis—To investigate whether MLK3 is directly involved in TGF-β1-induced apoptosis, we generated cell lines stably overexpressing MLK3 and the dominant-negative form of MLK3 (dnMLK3) in FaO cells (Fig. 3a) and Hep3B cells (Fig. 4a). Without TGF-β1 treatment, apoptotic cell death was not observed in cells expressing MLK3. However, TGF-β1 treatment significantly enhanced TGF-β1-mediated apoptosis compared with the control cells in FaO cells (Fig. 3, c and d) and Hep3B cells (Fig. 4, b and c). FaO cells expressing MLK3 had ∼7% survival, whereas the control FaO cells had 12% survival by 24 h after TGF-β1 treatment. In Hep3B cells, the survival of MLK3-expressing cells was about 7%, whereas that of the control cells was about 20% by 72 h after TGF-β1 treatment. Because MLK3 was cloned into the pCMS.EGFP vector, stable cells expressing either MLK3 or the dominant-negative form of MLK3 could be visualized by green fluorescence. Counts of intact GFP-positive cells revealed a rapid decline in numbers within 72 h after TGF-β1 treatment in the Hep3B cells expressing MLK3 (Fig. 4b). Previously, we have demonstrated that caspase-3 is involved in TGF-β1-induced apoptosis and that TGF-β1 treatment induced the progressive proteolytic processing of caspase-3 (4Choi K.S. Lim I.K. Brady J.N. Kim S.-J. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cleavage of caspase-3 was markedly increased in FaO cells expressing MLK3 (Fig. 2d). To assess the effect of the dominant-negative form of MLK3 on TGF-β1-induced apoptosis, stable cell lines were generated using the dominant-negative MLK3 cloned into pCMS.EGFP as described previously (26Xu Z. Maroney A.C. Dobrzanski P. Kukekov N.V. Greene L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4713-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Expression of dnMLK3 blocked TGF-β1-induced apoptosis and cleavage of caspase-3 (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, our results indicate that activation of MLK3 by TGF-β1 is an important step in the apoptotic pathway of TGF-β1.Fig. 4MLK3 expression regulates TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in Hep3B cells. a, expression levels of MLK3 in Hep3B cell clones stably transfecting pCMS-EGFP, pCMS-EGFP-wtMLK3, and pCMS-EGFP-dnMLK3. b, GFP fluorescence photomicrographs of clone #1 cells stably expressing vector, wtMLK3, or dnMLK3 and treated with or without TGF-β1 for 72 h. c, the percentage of surviving cells among clone #1 cells stably expressing vector, wtMLK3, or dnMLK3 and treated with or without TGF-β1 for 72 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test the possibility of whether the members of the MLK family play distinct or overlapping roles in mediating a TGF-β effect, we also generated cell lines stably overexpressing the dominant-negative forms of MLK1 and MLK2 in FaO cells. Their overexpression had the same effect as that of the MLK3 mutant on TGF-β1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5). MLK3 Does Not Inhibit TGF-β/Smad-mediated Transcriptional Responses—We next investigated whether MLK3 is primarily/solely involved in mediating the apoptotic activity of TGF-β1 or if it is also an important mediator for other types of TGF-β1 activities, such as the activation of Smad-mediated transcription of target genes, using FaO cells stably expressing wtMLK3 and dnMLK3. To analyze the effect of MLK3 on TGF-β/Smad-dependent transcription, FaO cells stably expressing wtMLK3, dnMLK3, and control vector were co-transfected with SBE4-luc, which contains four tandem repeats of the Smad-binding element (SBE) (27Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of wtMLK3 or dnMLK3 had no effect on the TGF-β1-induced transcriptional activity of this reporter gene construct (Fig. 6a). We also examined whether MLK3 mediates TGF-β/Smad-mediated transcription of endogenous target genes. Vector control-, wtMLK3-, and dnMLK3-expressing FaO cells were analyzed for the expression of several TGF-β/Smad-responsive genes by Western blot analysis. Cells were treated with TGF-β1 for 24 h, and Western blot analysis of p21 and c-Myc was performed. TGF-β1 treatment increased the levels of p21 and p15 proteins in all three cells (Fig. 6b), suggesting that MLK3 is primarily/solely involved in mediating the apoptotic activity of TGF-β1 in FaO cells. Activation of MAP Kinases in FaO Cells Expressing MLK3 during TGF-β1-induced Apoptosis—As shown in Fig. 2a, the phosphorylation level of MLK3 increases with maximum activation occurring 8 h after TGF-β1 treatment. All three MAP kinases (ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38) show a gradual increase with maximum activation occurring 20 h after treatment with TGF-β1 (Fig. 7a). These results suggest that the activations of all three MAP kinases follow the activation of MLK3. We then investigated the activities of all three MAP kinases (ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38) in either MLK3- or dnMLK3-expressing FaO cells during TGF-β1-induced apoptosis. In the MLK3-expressing cells (Fig. 7b, wtMLK3-#1), all three MAP kinases were not activated in the absence of TGF-β1 treatment, whereas these MAP kinases were activated in the presence of TGF-β1 treatment. The activation levels of all three MAP kinases were significantly enhanced in FaO cells expressing MLK3 compared with the vector control cells that had been treated with TGF-β1 (Fig. 7b). In contrast, the dominant-negative form of MLK3 blocked TGF-β1-induced activation of all three MAP kinases. Therefore, our results indicate that the activation of MLK3 by TGF-β1 is an important step in the TGF-β1-induced activation of these MAP kinases. Role of MAP Kinases Activated in TGF-β1-induced Cleavage of Caspase-3—To determine the role of activated MAP kinases in TGF-β1-induced cleavage of caspase-3 in either MLK3- or dnMLK3-expressing cells, the effects of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor PD9805923, a p38 kinase inhibitor, SB203580, and a JNK inhibitor, SP600125 (anthra[1,9-cd]pyrazol-6(2H)-one), were examined. Treatment with PD98059 accelerated TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in all three cell lines. However, treatment with SB203580 completely abolished TGF-β1-induced cleavage of caspase-3 in vector control cells, and TGF-β1-induced cleavage of caspase-3 was markedly suppressed in both wtMLK3- and dnMLK3-expressing cells (Fig. 8a). In contrast, treatment with SP600125 slightly enhanced TGF-β1-induced cleavage of caspase-3. To verify the specificity of the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (28Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar), we examined whether the TGF-β1 induction of JNK activation is suppressed by SP600125 in FaO cells. A recent study shows that TGF-β induction of JNK1 activity is blocked by the addition of the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (29Yue J. Sun B. Liu G. Mulder K.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 199: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8b, treatment with SP600125 at 10 mm markedly decreases TGF-β1-induced JNK activation. Although several elements in the TGF-β-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway that lead to JNK and p38 kinase activation have been defined, a key question that remains unresolved is how the TGF-β signaling pathway activates JNK and p38 kinases. JNK and p38 MAP kinases, stress-induced MAP kinases, have been shown to participate in the induction of apoptosis by TGF-β1 (25Park H.J. Kim B.C. Kim S.-J. Choi K.S. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Yoo J. Ghiassi M. Jirmanova L. Balliet A.G. Hoffman B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Liebermann D.A. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43001-43017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in CH33 cells is mediated by Daxx, which facilitates JNK activation (31Perlman R. Schiemann W.P. Brooks M.W. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Daxx, a protein associated with the Fas receptor that mediates activation of the Jun amino-terminal kinase and programmed cell death induced by Fas, interacts physically with the cytoplasmic domain of the type II TGF-β receptor. Recently, Yoo et al. (30Yoo J. Ghiassi M. Jirmanova L. Balliet A.G. Hoffman B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Liebermann D.A. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43001-43017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) reported that the ectopic expression of GADD45b in AML12 murine hepatocytes is sufficient to activate p38 and to trigger apoptotic cell death, whereas antisense inhibition of GADD45b expression blocks TGF-β-dependent p38 activation and apoptosis, suggesting that GADD45b participates in TGF-β-induced apoptosis by acting upstream of p38 activation. We have shown previously that during the progression of TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in FaO cells, all three MAP kinases exhibit concurrent activation; however, the strong and sustained proapoptotic signals from both p38 and JNK mediate TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in FaO cells (25Park H.J. Kim B.C. Kim S.-J. Choi K.S. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The significant contribution of both p38 and JNK activated by TGF-β1 to apoptosis of FaO cells was confirmed by studies using a specific inhibitor of p38, genetic constructs encoding dominant-negative forms interfering with the p38 or JNK pathway, and transient expression of WT p38α, p38β, JNK2, the dominant-negative form of JNK2, or the dominant-negative form of SEK1. Mixed lineage kinases (8Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were identified as dual specificity kinases, i.e. kinases with both serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase activity (8Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Ing Y.L. Leung I.W. Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Lassam N.J.

Biochem. 1995; 234: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although the tyrosine kinase activity of MLKs has not yet been reported, MLKs contain the tyrosine kinase signature motif in addition to the serine/threonine kinase motif (for review, see Ref. 10Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the known MLKs in mammalian cell lines act as MAPK kinase kinases (MKKKs) to activate the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase pathways. MLK3 and DLK have also been shown to activate the p38 MAPK pathway, but it is not known whether other MLKs can also activate p38. Therefore, in this study, we explored whether MLKs are involved in the TGF-β1-induced apoptotic cascades by activating MAP kinases. Our study indicates that the MLK family plays a role in TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells. As shown in Figs. 2 and 7a, the activation of all three MAP kinases following the activation of MLKs suggests that MLKs participate in TGF-β1-induced apoptosis by acting upstream of p38 activation. First, transcripts for members of the MLK family, MLK1, MLK2, MLK3, and DLK, are expressed in FaO hepatoma cells. Second, TGF-β1 treatment induced phosphorylation of MLK3 in a time-dependent manner. Eleven in vivo phosphorylation sites of MLK3 were identified, and most of the phosphorylation sites are clustered at the carboxyl terminus (32Vacratsis P.O. Phinney B.S. Gage D.A. Gallo K.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5613-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the phosphorylation sites of MLK3 induced by TGF-β are not known. Third, overexpression of MLK3 in FaO and Hep3B cells enhanced TGF-β1-induced apoptosis. Lastly, the dominant-negative form of MLK3 effectively protected both the FaO and Hep3B cells from apoptosis induced by TGF-β1. MLKs are known to activate JNK in vivo by directly phosphorylating and activating the JNK kinase SEK1 (MKK4 and MKK7) (13Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15167-15173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The ability of MLK3 to activate the ERK/MAPK pathway has been reported (33Hartkamp J. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2195-2202PubMed Google Scholar); the study demonstrated that the overexpression of wild type MLK3 leads to a morphological transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts and that MLK3 preferentially activates the JNK/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) cascade, and to a lesser degree, the ERK pathway. Interestingly, MEK1 is highly phosphorylated in vivo in MLK3-transformed fibroblasts, whereas ERK phosphorylation was barely detectable. Recently, another report indicated that although MLK3 can activate MEK1, sustained JNK activation induced by MLK3 can result in the attenuation of the mitogen-activated ERK pathway (34Shen Y.H. Godlewski J. Zhu J. Sathyanarayana P. Leaner V. Birrer M.J. Rana A. Tzivion G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26715-26721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, in this study, we demonstrated that in FaO cells expressing MLK3, all three MAP kinases, ERK, JNK, and p38, were markedly activated in response to TGF-β1. The different patterns of activation of the stress kinases in different model systems may be caused not only by the cell types or stress stimuli but also by the timing, intensity, and duration of activation. ERK has been reported to be cytoprotective against apoptosis triggered by oxidative stress, tumor necrosis factor α, growth factor deprivation, and proapoptotic drugs (35Xia Z. Dickens M.

In this study, we have observed that enhanced activation of ERK in FaO cells could not override the TGF-β1-induced proapoptotic signals. These findings imply that the strong apoptotic signal induced by TGF-β1 may be able to block cell responses to growth and survival factors acting through the ERK/MAPK pathway. Supporting evidence includes the observation that treatment with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, significantly enhanced TGF-β1-induced caspase-3 activation. Cell death is controlled by the integration of multiple signals through a complex network including both positive and negative regulators of apoptosis. In this study, we also attempted to examine the specific role of each MAP kinase on TGF-β1-induced apoptosis. In a previous study, we showed that both interfering with p38 activity by overexpression of the dominant-negative MKK6 mutant and inhibition of the JNK pathway by overexpression of the DN SEK1 mutant resulted in the suppression of mitochondrial cytochrome c release, abrogating TGF-β1-induced apoptosis (25Park H.J. Kim B.C. Kim S.-J. Choi K.S. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that interfering with the p38 pathway with a p38 kinase inhibitor, SB203580, markedly decreased TGF-β1-induced caspase-3 activation, whereas inhibition of the JNK pathway with a JNK inhibitor, SP600125, slightly increased TGF-β1-induced caspase-3 activation. In the previous study, we could not observe the specific role of JNK on TGF-β1-induced apoptosis because DN SEK1 blocked not only the TGF-β1-induced JNK activation but also the TGF-β1-induced p38 activation. The role of SEK1 in the activation of both JNK and p38 is supported by the finding that SEK-/- fibroblasts exhibit defects in both JNK and p38 phosphorylation (22Ganiatsas S. Kwee L. Fujiwara Y. Perkins A. Ikeda T. Labow M.A. Zon L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6881-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that MLKs serve as upstream mediators of TGF-β1-induced activation of MAP kinases in TGF-β1-induced apoptotic cascades and that TGF-β1 induces phosphorylation of MLK3. TGF-β1 treatment activates not only p38 but also JNK and ERK, but TGF-β1 induces apoptosis in FaO cells through the p38 MAP kinase pathway. The involvement of p38 in TGF-β1-induced apoptosis is further supported by the recent study in AML12 cells and primary hepatocytes showing that TGF-β1-induced apoptosis in these cells is mediated through the activation of only p38 MAP kinase (30Yoo J. Ghiassi M. Jirmanova L. Balliet A.G. Hoffman B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Liebermann D.A. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1995957214,"Insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes is characterized by defects in muscle glucose uptake and hepatic overproduction of both glucose and lipids. These hepatic defects are perplexing because insulin normally suppresses glucose production and increases lipid synthesis in the liver. To understand the mechanisms for these seemingly paradoxical defects, we examined the activation of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and protein kinase B (PKB), two key signaling factors that operate downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and regulate various insulin-sensitive metabolic processes. Livers and muscles of three insulin-resistant rodent models were studied. In livers of type 2 diabetic non-obese Goto-Kakazaki rats and ob/ob-diabetic mice, the activation of PKB was impaired, whereas activation of aPKC was surprisingly maintained. In livers of non-diabetic high fatfed mice, the activation of both aPKC and PKB was maintained. In contrast to the maintenance of aPKC activation in the liver, insulin activation of aPKC was impaired in muscles of Goto-Kakazaki-diabetic rats and ob/ob-diabetic and non-diabetic high fat-fed mice. These findings suggest that, at least in these rodent models, (a) defects in aPKC activation contribute importantly to skeletal muscle insulin resistance observed in both high fat feeding and type 2 diabetes; (b) insulin signaling defects in muscle are not necessarily accompanied by similar defects in liver; (c) defects in hepatic PKB activation occur in association with, and probably contribute importantly to, the development of overt diabetes; and (d) maintenance of hepatic aPKC activation may explain the continued effectiveness of insulin for stimulating certain metabolic actions in the liver.

Our previous findings suggest that TCDD inhibits the activation and subsequent expansion of T cells following antigen stimulation in mice, leading to a decreased level of T cell-derived cytokines involved in antibody production. In the present study, we investigated the effects of activated AhR on T cells by transiently expressing a constitutively active AhR (CA-AhR) mutant in AhR-null Jurkat T cells. In agreement with our previous findings, CA-AhR markedly inhibited the growth of Jurkat T cells. The inhibited cell growth was found to be concomitant with both an increase in the annexin V-positive apoptotic cells and the accumulation of cells in the G1 phase. The growth inhibition was also shown to be mediated by both xenobiotic response element (XRE)-dependent and -independent mechanisms, because an A78D mutant of the CA-AhR, which lacks the ability of XRE-dependent transcription, partially inhibited the growth of Jurkat T cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CA-AhR induces expression changes in genes related to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. These expression changes were shown to be solely mediated in an XRE-dependent manner, because the A78D mutant of the CA-AhR did not induce them. To summarize, these results suggest that AhR activation causes apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, especially through expression changes in genes related to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by the XRE-dependent mechanism, leading to the inhibition of T cell growth. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is known to suppress T cell-dependent immune reactions through the activation of the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR).

Because both cations are present in mm concentrations in vivo, the physiologic relevance of the in vitro observations is unclear. We measured the affinity of both cations to the inactive and active states of the ligand- and cation-binding A-domain (CD11bA) from integrin CD11b/CD18 in the absence and presence of the single-chain 107 antibody (scFv107), an activation-insensitive ligand-mimetic antibody. Using titration calorimetry, we found that Mg2+ and Ca2+ display equivalent (mm) affinities to inactive CD11bA. Activation induced a ∼10-fold increase in the binding affinity of Mg2+ to CD11bA with no change in that of Ca2+ (106 μm ± 16 and 2.1 mm ± 0.19, respectively, n = 4). This increase is largely driven by favorable enthalpy. scFv107 induced a 50–80-fold increase in the binding affinity of Ca2+ (but not Mg2+ or Mn2+) to either form of CD11bA. Thus the affinity of metal ions to integrins is itself regulated by the activation state of these receptors and by certain ligands.

A. 2000; 37: 7778-7783Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). tmRNA has properties of both a tRNA and an mRNA. The 5′ and 3′ ends of the RNA are folded into a tRNA-like structure, that can be charged with alanine by alanyl-tRNA synthetase (6Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9223-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 7Ushida C. Himeno H. Watanabe T. Muto A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3392-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Another portion of the RNA contains a specialized internal open reading frame that encodes a peptide containing determinants for multiple proteases (8Tu G.F. Reid G.E. Zhang J.G. Moritz R.L.

Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), tmRNA charged with alanine enters the A site of a stalled ribosome, and the nascent polypeptide is transferred to alanyl-tmRNA by trans-peptidation. Then, the reading frame of the translating ribosome switches from the original mRNA to the mRNA-like portion of tmRNA. Translation of the tmRNA open reading frame results in the addition of a peptide tag to the nascent polypeptide, and termination at the SsrA-encoded stop codon releases the tagged polypeptide and allows the ribosome to be recycled back to a new round of initiation. The SsrA-encoded peptide tag targets the nascent polypeptide for rapid degradation by a number of proteases (8Tu G.F. Reid G.E. Zhang J.G. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1348-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In addition to general translation factors, tmRNA activity depends on at least three RNA-binding proteins, small protein B (SmpB) (12Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) (13Rudinger-Thirion J. Giege R. Felden B. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and ribosomal protein S1 (14Wower I.K. Zwieb C.W. Guven S.A. Wower J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6612-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). SmpB and EF-Tu bind simultaneously to the tRNA domain of the tmRNA and are required for efficient aminoacylation by alanyl-tRNA synthetase and for interaction with target ribosomes (12Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 15Barends S. Karzai A.W. Sauer R.T. Wower J. Kraal B. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1620-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The ribosomal protein S1 binds in and around the mRNA-like domain of tmRNA and may facilitate the entry of the internal peptide reading frame into the stalled ribosome (14Wower I.K. Zwieb C.W. Guven S.A. Wower J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6612-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Bordeau V. Felden B. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Both EF-Tu and S1 are also required for canonical translation reactions, whereas SmpB has no known role other than in SsrA-mediated peptide tagging. Recently, the cryo-electron microscopy structure of tmRNA in complex with the ribosome was reported (18Valle M. Gillet R. Kaur S. Henne A. Ramakrishnan V. Frank J. Science. 2003; 300: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The images of this rescue complex provide new insights into tmRNA function. They suggest specific roles for protein S1 and SmpB in trans-translation and indicate how tmRNA could move through the ribosome despite the complex topology associated with this process. Furthermore, recent data obtained from the 3.2-Å crystal structure of the ribonucleoprotein complex between tmRNA and SmpB suggest that binding of the tmRNA·SmpB complex to the ribosome drives SmpB toward the decoding center of the 30S ribosomal subunit (19Gutmann S. Haebel P.W. Metzinger L. Sutter M. Felden B. Ban N. Nature. 2003; 424: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In previous works, the binding of SmpB to wild-type and mutated tmRNA molecules has been studied (12Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 16Hanawa-Suetsugu K. Takagi M. Inokuchi H. Himeno H. Muto A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1620-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but no attempts were made to localize endogenous SmpB in bacterial cells, especially concerning its location on purified ribosomes. In this study, we have monitored the localization of endogenous SmpB in vivo using bacterial strains with deletions of either ssrA, smpB, or both with the help of a polyclonal antibody against His-tagged SmpB. Subcellular fractionation was used to demonstrate that the protein is associated exclusively with 70S ribosomes, independently of the presence of tmRNA. Subsequently, in vitro trans-translation assays indicate that SmpB pre-assembled to stalled ribosomes triggers trans-peptidation, whereas elongation factor Tu is dispensable during the first peptidyl transfer. Our results demonstrate the existence of a novel route to initiate trans-translation. Construction of smpB-, ssrA-, and smpB:ssrA-deficient Escherichia coli Strains—The smpB and/or ssrA genes were disrupted by using the method described by Datsenko and Wanner (20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar). The primers smpB5′ (CTAAGATAGAGCCTTGTCCCCCGCAGGATTGATATGGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC) and smpB3′ (GAGGAACTGGTCAATAATTGGAGTGCAGGTTTAACGCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG) were used to disrupt the smpB gene. The primers ssrA5′ (CTTATTGGCTATCACATCCGACACAAATGTTGCCATGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC) and ssrA3′ (GCGCCGTGCGGGCTCTTAGGACTTCATCGGATGACTCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG) were used to disrupt the ssrA gene. The primers smpB5′ (CTAAGATAGAGCCTTGTCCCCCGCAGGATTGATATGGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC) and ssrA3′ (GCGCCGTGCGGGCTCTTAGGACTTCATCGGATGACTCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG) were used to disrupt the smpB and ssrA genes. Complementation Assays—The ampicillin-resistant pJW28 plasmid (21Withey J. Friedman D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2148-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the tetracycline-resistant pSsrA1 plasmid (22Collier J. Binet E. Bouloc P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were used to express tmRNA alone or tmRNA with SmpB, respectively. Complementation with SmpB was performed by the co-transformation of the ΔsmpB strain with the ampicillin-resistant pet-21a-SmpB and the chloramphenicol-resistant pACYC184 plasmid encoding the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the lac promoter sequence (23Lee S. Ishii M. Tadaki T. Muto A. Himeno H. RNA (N.Y.). 2001; 7: 999-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase at 37 °C, diluted at an A600 of 0.01 in an LB broth containing the antibiotics and incubated at 45 °C. The expression of the His-tagged SmpB proteins was induced by adding 10 nm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Determination of tmRNA and SmpB Levels in Subcellular Fractions of E. coli—E. coli strains, grown in LB broth, were harvested to midlogarithmic phase. The cell pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm ammonium acetate, 10.5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and lysed by sonication. The cell lysates were treated with DNase I for 20 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 45 min. Supernatants (S30 fraction) were either directly loaded onto the sucrose gradient or further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min to obtain the S100 fraction (supernatant) and the crude ribosome P100 fraction (pellet resuspended in a small volume of lysis buffer). Proteins (50 μg) from each fraction were electrophoresed on 15% acrylamide Tris-glycine gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. SmpB was immunodetected by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against His-tagged SmpB protein followed by chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). For the determination of tmRNA levels, the crude ribosome P100 pellet from 10 ml of S30 fraction was resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer. RNAs from 2 ml of these S30, S100, and P100 fractions were extracted with phenol, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 40 μl of water. For each fraction (S30, S100, and P100), the same volume of RNA corresponding to the same number of E. coli cells was analyzed by Northern blotting using a 32P-labeled DNA oligonucleotide complementary to Ssra RNA (5′-CGGGTACGGGTAGGATCGCACACC-3′) as described later. Half-life determination of tmRNA was performed by addition of 500 μg/ml rifampicin in the culture, and RNA extractions and analysis were performed as described in Ref. 24Masse E. Escorcia F.E. Gottesman S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2374-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar. Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation and Analysis—Crude ribosomes were fractionated on a 10–30% sucrose gradient (10 ml) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm ammonium acetate, and 10.5 mm magnesium acetate for 15 h at 18,000 rpm and 4 °C in a SW41 rotor (Beckman). RNAs were isolated from each fraction by extraction with phenol and precipitation with ethanol. For Northern hybridization, RNAs were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel containing 6.5% (v/v) formaldehyde and transferred in 10× sodium/sodium citrate buffer (SSC) to nylon membrane by the capillary method. Pre-hybridization and hybridization with 32P-labeled DNA oligonucleotides complementary to Ssra RNA (5′-CGGGTACGGGTAGGATCGCACACC-3′) or 16S ribosomal RNA (5′-CCGTCCGCCACTCGTCAGCAA-3′) were carried out in ExpressHyb according to the protocol (Clontech). Analysis of the level of SmpB was performed by Western blotting. Purification of His-tagged SmpB Protein—E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/pet-21a-SmpB was grown in 3 liters of LB broth at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5. After induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, cells were collected by centrifugation; resuspended in 3 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% desoxycholate acid, and 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme per gram of pellet; and frozen and thawed four times. Lysate was treated with DNase I (100 units/ml) for 20 min at 30 °C, and inclusion bodies containing SmpB-His protein were pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 15 min. Inclusion bodies were washed three times with 1% desoxycholate acid and lysed with 8 m guanidine. Denatured SmpB-His proteins were renatured by a 100-fold dilution in phosphate-buffered saline and mixed for 2 h at 4 °C with 4 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen). Beads were washed five times with 200 ml of buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and 500 mm NaCl), and SmpB-His proteins were eluted from the beads with buffer A containing 600 mm imidazole and dialyzed extensively against buffer B (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,2mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol). In Vitro Binding Analysis—70S ribosomes from ΔsmpBΔssrA cells were purified by gradient sucrose centrifugation and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with a 10-fold molar excess of His-tagged SmpB in buffer E (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm ammonium chloride, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The resulting 70S·SmpB complexes were further purified on a 10–30% sucrose gradient in buffer E to eliminate free SmpB. 70S·SmpB ribosomes (25 nm) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with an increasing amount of tmRNA in 400 μl of buffer E and loaded on a 10–30% sucrose gradient. Fractions containing either 70S ribosome or tmRNA (fractions including tmRNA and soluble proteins) were pooled. Proteins were extracted from one-half of the samples by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, electrophoresed on 15% acrylamide Tris-glycine gel, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and SmpB was detected by Western blotting. RNA from the other half of pooled fractions was prepared by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. tmRNA was detected by Northern hybridization as described above. The tmRNA binding affinity for 70S ribosome was monitored by incubating 50 nm 70S ribosome or 70S·SmpB complexes with either 100 or 250 nm tmRNA in 400 μl of buffer E. After 15 min at 37 °C, ribosomes and soluble tmRNA were purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The amount of tmRNA in each fraction was detected by Northern hybridization. Chemicals and Polymix Buffer—Nucleoside triphosphates, RNA-guard (porcine), and radioisotopes were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Phosphoenolpyruvate, putrescine, spermidine, myokinase, and unlabeled amino acids were from Sigma, pyruvate kinase was from Roche Applied Science, and other chemicals were from Merck. Polymix buffer (25Jelenc P.C. Kurland C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3174-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) used in trans-translation experiments contains (at final concentration) 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm CaCl2,5mm NH4Cl, 95 mm KCl, 8 mm putrescine, 1 mm spermidine, 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.3), and 1 mm dithioerythritol. In Vitro Peptidyl Transfer Experiments—XR7 mRNA encodes the tetrapeptide MFTI (fMet-Phe-Thr-Ile). It was transcribed from PCR-generated DNA using T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (26Pavlov M.Y. Freistroffer D.V. Heurgue-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and contains the sequence GGGCCCUUGUUAACAAUUAAGGAGGUAUACUAUGUUUACGAUU (the start codon is underlined). The ribosomal complexes (RCs) were prepared by translating XR7 mRNA coding for Met-Phe-Thr-Ile in a translation mixture containing [3H]fMet-tRNA and subsequently purified from the component of translation mixture by gel filtration through a Sephacryl S300 column as described previously (27Jelenc P.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The ribosomes for the ribosomal complexes were isolated from smpB:ssrA-depleted E. coli strain to have smpB-depleted ribosomes (drR). The other components necessary for the generation of the RCs were purified as described previously (26Pavlov M.Y. Freistroffer D.V. Heurgue-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Two types of ribosomal complexes were prepared with ribosomes alone (drRC) or ribosomes pre-incubated with SmpB-His in a ratio of 1 ribosome to 10 SmpB-His proteins (drRC·SmpB). Purified tmRNA was aminoacylated in polymix buffer containing 7.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1.5 mm ATP, 1.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2 mm GTP, 1 mm alanine, 0.45 unit of alanyl-tRNA-synthetase/μl reaction mixture, and 0.34 unit/μl RNAguard. 0.02 mm EF-Tu was added when indicated, and the reaction was performed at 37 °C for 15 min. The extent of tmRNA aminoacylation was monitored in a parallel reaction where 0.1 mm [14C]alanine with a specific activity of 250 cpm/pmol was added instead of 1 mm cold alanine. Aminoacylation was monitored by placing 10 μl aliquots into 5 ml of 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, precipitating them for 10 min on ice, and filtering them through GF-C filters (Whatman). The filters were dried at 110 °C, and their 14C content was determined by scintillation counting. The reaction of peptidyl transfer of the tetrapeptide MFTI from tRNAIle (at the ribosomal P site) to the Ala-tmRNA in the ribosomal A site was initiated by mixing RCs and aminoacylated tmRNA. Aminoacylated tmRNA was added to ribosomal complexes in at least 2× molar excess over total ribosomes in RCs. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and the extent of the transfer was monitored by quenching the 0.1 ml aliquots of the reaction in 50% formic acids at the indicated times. Pentapeptide fMFTIA (fMet-Phe-Thr-Ile-Ala) formation was monitored by HPLC with a LiChrospher 100 RP-18 HPLC column from Merck. Samples for HPLC were prepared and processed as described previously (26Pavlov M.Y. Freistroffer D.V. Heurgue-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The (isocratic) elution buffer was 50% methanol in water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, which gives a pH below 2. At this pH, the alanine has a negative retention time (28Meek J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1632-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), and the addition of alanine to the peptide leads to a lower retention time. Gene Disruption of smpB and/or ssrA—To analyze the functional activity of SmpB and tmRNA during trans-translation, E. coli strains deficient in only SmpB, only tmRNA, or both SmpB and tmRNA were constructed by PCR-based chromosomal disruption (20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar). These deletion strains have an identical genetic background; the method removes only the gene of interest, and the selection marker is removable. Because ssrA is located immediately downstream of smpB in E. coli, the double deletion was designed in one shot. First, we constructed strains in which the whole smpB, ssrA, or smpB-ssrA genes were replaced by a kanamycin-resistant gene. In a second step, the kanamycin-resistant gene was removed with the help of FLP recombinase to obtain antibiotic-sensitive strains (20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar). The single mutants (ΔsmpB and ΔssrA strains) and the double mutant (ΔsmpBΔssrA strain) displayed no significant difference in growth rate at 37 °C in rich medium as compared with the parental strain. In log phase at 45 °C, the ΔsmpB, ΔssrA, and ΔsmpBΔssrA strains grew equally fast and about 20% more slowly than their parental strain, in line with the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype reported previously for ΔsmpB and ΔssrA E. coli strains (12Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). As described previously (6Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9223-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 12Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 21Withey J. Friedman D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2148-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the phenotypes of the ssrA-, smpB-, and ssrA/smpB-defective strains can be complemented when expressing the corresponding wild-type genes from a plasmid (Fig. 1, A–C). The growth rate at 45 °Cofthe ΔsmpB strain was fully rescued by expressing a His-tagged SmpB protein (Fig. 1B), indicating that the activity of the His-tagged SmpB is similar to that of an unmodified SmpB protein (Fig. 1C). In a first experiment, the expression levels of tmRNA in the three disrupted strains were measured and compared with the wild-type level. Northern blots confirmed that both the ΔssrA and ΔsmpBΔssrA strains failed to express tmRNA (Fig. 2A). Control experiments showed a 3-fold shorter half-life of tmRNA in the ΔsmpB cells (∼20 min) compared with wild-type cells (∼60 min) (Fig. 2B). The expression of endogenous SmpB was monitored by Western blots, using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against recombinant His-tagged SmpB. Cell lysates from the wild-type and the three disrupted strains were fractionated by successive centrifugations to obtain S30 (whole fraction), S100 (soluble fraction), and P100 (crude ribosome fraction) extracts. Immunoblots against the four S30 fractions confirmed the presence of SmpB in the wild-type and ΔssrA strains and the absence of SmpB in the ΔsmpB and ΔsmpBΔssrA strains (Fig. 2C). The SmpB level was reduced in the ΔssrA strain compared with that in the wild-type strain, and the total tmRNA level in the ΔsmpB strain was significantly lower than that in the wild-type (Fig. 2, A and D). The reduction in tmRNA content could be explained by the above-mentioned reduced half-life of tmRNA in cells lacking SmpB (see also “Discussion”). Northern blot analysis of RNAs corresponding to equivalent amounts of cellular material from the 30S, 100S, and P100 fractions reveals that the major fraction of tmRNA was ribosome-bound in wild-type but not in ΔsmpB cells (Fig. 2D). SmpB Binds 70S Ribosomes in Vivo in the Absence of tmRNA—tmRNA from wild-type strains is mainly found in the crude ribosomal fraction (P100), and its recruitment to stalled 70S ribosomes requires SmpB (12Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 16Hanawa-Suetsugu K. Takagi M. Inokuchi H. Himeno H. Muto A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1620-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, SmpB was also expected to be in the P100 fraction from wild-type cells, as found here (Fig. 2C). More surprisingly, SmpB from an ssrA-deleted strain can also be seen in the crude ribosome fraction (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, SmpB cannot be seen in the soluble fraction (S100) of any strain, whereas tmRNA, visualized by Northern blots, can be found in the S100 fraction from both the wild-type and the ΔSmpB cells (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that endogenous SmpB binds to the 70S ribosomes in vivo, independently of the presence of tmRNA. To verify that the appearance of SmpB in the P100 fraction was due to its binding to ribosomes and not because of aggregation, we performed sucrose gradient experiments. 70S ribosomes, derived from P100 fractions from both wild-type and ΔssrA strains, were fractionated on a sucrose density gradient (Fig. 3A, panel 1), and the presence of tmRNA in the different fractions was monitored by Northern blotting (Fig. 3A, panel 3). tmRNA co-sediments with 70S ribosomes from the wild-type P100 fraction (Fig. 3A, panels 2 and 3), as described previously (12Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 29Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Inokuchi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, immunoblots show that SmpB is in complex with 70S ribosomes from the P100 fraction of not only wild-type (Fig. 3A, panel 4) but also of ΔssrA cells (Fig. 3A, panel 5). This suggests that the main fraction of SmpB in the cytoplasm of both wild-type and tmRNA-lacking cells is ribosome-bound. In a control experiment, S30 fractions from wild-type and ΔssrA strains were loaded on the sucrose gradient directly, and in this case as well, all SmpB co-sedimented with the 70S ribosomes, independently of the presence of tmRNA (Fig. 3B, panels 1, 4, and 5). Binding of Purified SmpB to 70S Ribosomes and tmRNA—To determine the stoichiometry of SmpB binding to 70S ribosomes in the absence of tmRNA, a constant amount of His-tagged SmpB was titrated with ribosomes purified from the ΔssrA/Δ SmpB strain. After incubation, the reaction mix was fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation, and the presence of ribosome-bound SmpB was quantified by Western blotting. Pure SmpB and pure ribosomes form a stable complex without tmRNA (Fig. 4A), in agreement with the results obtained with the crude P100 or S30 fractions (Fig. 3, A and B). At a molar ratio of one ribosome per two SmpB molecules, all SmpB appeared in complex with ribosomes (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 8). This demonstrates, firstly, that all SmpB molecules were active in ribosome binding and, secondly, that one ribosome could accommodate two SmpB molecules. To determine whether SmpB, pre-bound to ribosomes, can recruit tmRNA, 70S ribosomes pre-loaded with SmpB were incubated with either a 2- or 5-fold molar excess of tmRNA and loaded onto a sucrose density gradient. Northern blot analysis of the 70S·SmpB and the tmRNA fractions show that tmRNA, free of SmpB, could bind 70S ribosomes that had been preloaded with SmpB. At the same time, the affinity of tmRNA to the ribosomes depended on the presence of SmpB, as demonstrated by a parallel experiment. Here, tmRNA was incubated with 70S ribosomes in the absence of SmpB, before the samples were loaded onto a sucrose gradient. The Northern blots reveal a much weaker binding of tmRNA to ribosomes in the absence of SmpB (Fig. 4B, top panels) than in the presence of SmpB (Fig. 4B, bottom panels). Because SmpB binds both tmRNA (12Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 15Barends S. Karzai A.W. Sauer R.T. Wower J. Kraal B. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1620-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and 70S ribosomes in vivo (this report), the affinities of SmpB to ribosomes and to tmRNA were compared. For this, 70S ribosomes preloaded with SmpB were titrated with purified, native tmRNA from a 1:1 to 1:100 ratio between the ribosome and the tmRNA concentrations. After incubation, the samples were loaded onto a sucrose gradient, and Western blots show that nearly all SmpB remained localized in complex with the ribosomes (Fig. 4C, top left panel). Only a few percent of the SmpB molecules were localized (Western blot) to the tmRNA fraction (Northern blot), as seen by comparing lanes 6 and 12 in the panels of Fig. 4C. That tmRNA·SmpB complexes co-sediment with tmRNA, rather than with ribosomes, was demonstrated in a control experiment performed without 70S ribosomes (data not shown). The fact that tmRNA at a 90-fold excess over 70S ribosomes failed to pull SmpB from its ribosome-bound state to its tmRNA-bound state (Fig. 4C) shows that the affinity of SmpB to tmRNA-carrying ribosomes was much higher than the affinity of SmpB to free tmRNA. Therefore, this experiment does not report on the affinity of SmpB to free ribosomes compared with the affinity of SmpB to free tmRNA molecules. This piece of information is hard to come by because SmpB binding to ribosomes induces strong tmRNA binding to those very same ribosomes. SmpB and EF-Tu in Trans-translation—To study the function of SmpB during trans-translation, an in vitro system for mRNA translation was assembled with all components for initiation of trans-translation prepared to high purity (26Pavlov M.Y.

Functional assays using mutant E4orf4 revealed that deregulation of Src signaling, activation of the Jun kinase pathway, and cell blebbing were all critically dependent on Src binding. In contrast, PP2A-Bα binding per se was not required to engage the Src-dependent death pathway but was more critical for triggering a distinct death activity. Both E4orf4 death activities were manifested within a given cell population, were typified by distinct morphological features, and contributed to overall cell killing, although to different extents in various cell types. We conclude that E4orf4 binding to the Src kinase domain leads to deregulation of Src signaling and plays a crucial role in induction of the cytoplasmic death pathway.

E4orf4 is not essential for viral growth, although several activities were reported during viral infection that were linked to its ability to interact with cellular PP2A. However, the exact consequence on PP2A activity remains unclear (1Tauber B. Dobner T. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 278: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 2Muller U. Kleinberger T. Shenk T. J.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 864-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is believed but not proven that E4orf4 cooperates with other viral products to trigger cell death at the end of the infectious cycle to propagate viral progeny (7Marcellus R.C. Lavoie J.N. Boivin D. Shore G.C. Ketner G. Branton P.E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7144-7153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, over-expression of E4orf4 triggers p53-independent cell death, and evidence accumulates that E4orf4 killing is much higher in transformed and cancer cells (7Marcellus R.C. Lavoie J.N. Boivin D. Shore G.C. Ketner G. Branton P.E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7144-7153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Marcellus R.C. Branton P.E. Shore G.C. J.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7855-7865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because, adenoviral infection drives a process similar to cell transformation by stimulating proliferation and inhibiting p53-dependent cell death, it is conceivable that E4orf4 has evolved to act in a transformed-like genetic background. Deciphering the mechanisms involved in cell death induction is of great interest, because they may unravel ways to manipulate oncogene signaling to trigger tumor-selective death programs.Emerging evidence suggests that E4orf4 has several activities, some of which are cell type-specific. The specific localization of E4orf4 to the cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, and the nucleus illustrates the complexity of E4orf4 signaling with a number of potentially important cellular targets (12Lavoie J.N. Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Robert A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1037-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Gingras M.-C. Champagne C. Roy M.A. Lavoie J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Caspase-dependent apoptosis was observed in specific cell lines, but E4orf4-induced cell death generally proceeds independently of the classical pathways for apoptosis induction (death receptor and mitochondrial pathways) (14Livne A. Shtrichman R. Kleinberger T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Robert A. Miron M.J. Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Branton P.E. Lavoie J.N. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Indeed in most transformed and cancer cells, E4orf4 triggers a ZVAD (benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD)- and Bcl-2-resistant cell death pathway associated with some features of apoptosis, including externalization of phosphatidylserines, cell and nuclear shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and phagocytosis by neighboring cells (8Lavoie J.N.

We have shown that this cell death pathway is associated with E4orf4 accumulation in the cell membrane-cytoskeleton and is first manifested by the appearance of dramatic actin changes leading to dramatic cell blebbing (12Lavoie J.N. Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Robert A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1037-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This so-called cytoplasmic death activity is regulated by Src tyrosine kinases, requires the tyrosine phosphorylation of E4orf4, and involves the calcium-regulated cysteine proteases calpains (13Gingras M.-C. Champagne C. Roy M.A. Lavoie J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Robert A. Miron M.J. Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Branton P.E. Lavoie J.N. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Importantly, we have shown that E4orf4 targeting to cellular membranes recapitulates the Src-dependent death activity (15Robert A. Miron M.J. Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Branton P.E. Lavoie J.N. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting that tyrosine-phosphorylated E4orf4 acts by disrupting some critical tyrosine kinase signaling pathway on membranes. A distinct death activity was also observed, in the absence of E4orf4 tyrosine phosphorylation (15Robert A. Miron M.J. Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Branton P.E. Lavoie J.N. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This death program was rather associated with E4orf4 accumulation in the cell nucleus and led to a distinct morphological phenotype, characterized by dramatic cell shrinkage in the absence of early blebbing induction. The nuclear targets of E4orf4 remain unknown, but may be related to its ability to trigger an irreversible G2/M growth arrest in yeasts and in specific cancer cell lines (16Kornitzer D. Sharf R. Kleinberger T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Roopchand D.E. Lee J.M. Shahinian S. Paquette D. Bussey H. Branton P.E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5279-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Notably, E4orf4 killing and growth inhibition was shown to depend on its ability to bind to the regulatory subunit Bα of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A-Bα) and recruit PP2A phosphatase activity (10Shtrichman R.

Virol. 2000; 74: 7869-7877Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Whether E4orf4 acts by inhibiting and/or stimulating PP2A activity toward specific substrates in a way that relies on recruitment to PP2A-Bα to specific cell compartments remains unclear. Whatever the case, these studies indicated that extra functions are required for cell killing and that some PP2A-independent killing also exists. Although it is clear that E4orf4 possesses distinct activities in various cell types, the functional relationship between Src and PP2A was not addressed, and the molecular mechanisms involved in engagement of the so-called cytoplasmic death pathway remain elusive.We have delineated the determinants of E4orf4-Src association at the molecular level. E4orf4 mutant proteins were used to address the role of Src and PP2A-Bα binding in induction of the cytoplasmic death pathway typified by early changes in actin dynamics. The results strongly suggest that a physical interaction with the kinase domain of Src-like tyrosine kinases is critical to activate E4orf4 cytoplasmic death functions. This interaction requires a highly basic motif on E4orf4 that overlaps with, but is distinct from, the PP2A-Bα binding site. Based on the available data, E4orf4 binding to PP2A-Bα per se is dispensable for deregulation of Src signaling and activation of the cytoplasmic death pathway and appears more critical for induction of a distinct death program.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression Vectors and Mutagenesis—The following expression vectors were described previously: Ad2 HA-E4orf4 (8Lavoie J.N.

Untagged E4orf4 proteins were obtained by subcloning the HindIII-XhoI E4orf4 DNA fragments from HA-E4orf4 constructs into pCDNA3 vector. E4orf4-GFP constructs were produced by PCR amplification using HA-tagged versions and the following primers: 5′-AGA GGG CCC AG GTT CTT CCA GCT CTT CCA-3′and 5′-CTC CCC GGG CTG GAA CTG TGG CTC AGT-3′.

All mutations and DNA fragments generated by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.Cell Culture, Transfections, and Functional Assays—293T cells were derived from human embryonic kidney cells, although this cell line may be of neuronal origin (26Shaw G. Morse S. Ararat M. Graham F.L. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 869-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) and express Ad5 E1A and E1B proteins and large T antigen (27Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3468) Google Scholar). Human C-33A (American Type Culture Collection, HTB-31) is from cervical carcinoma. 293T and C-33A were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium and in α-modified Eagle's medium, respectively, both supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and streptomycin sulfate-penicillin (100 units/ml). Transfections of 293T were performed by the calcium phosphate method in culture dishes coated with polylysine as described (12Lavoie J.N. Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Robert A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1037-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Robert A. Miron M.J. Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Branton P.E. Lavoie J.N. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). C-33A cells were transfected using GeneSHUTTLE-40 (Qbiogene, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In vivo localization of GFP proteins was performed using a Nikon TE-200 inverted microscope equipped with a CO2/thermoregulated chamber and a ×40 0.6 numerical aperture (NA) objective. Images were captured as 16-bit TIFF files with a Photometrix Coolsnap FX cooled CCD camera (-30 °C) (Rooper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) driven by Metaview software version 4.5 (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 imaging system mounted on a Nikon Diaphot-TMD with ×20 (zoom ×3) or ×60 0.85 NA (zoom ×1.84) objective lens. The blebbing inducing activity and chromatin condensation were determined as described (13Gingras M.-C. Champagne C. Roy M.A. Lavoie J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were gently washed in PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm CaCl2, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS for 20 min, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min. Immunodetection of HA-E4orf4, E4orf4-GFP, and untagged E4orf4 was performed using mouse HA.11 anti-HA antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-GFP (Clontech), or rabbit 2419 anti-E4orf4, respectively, followed by Alexa 594- or Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), and staining of DNA was performed using 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Molecular Probes). Long-term cell killing was determined by colony-forming assays as described (13Gingras M.-C. Champagne C. Roy M.A. Lavoie J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When indicated, the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor Boc-Asp-(OMe)-CH2F (BocD-fmk, Calbiochem) was added to the culture medium at 15 μm during transfection and at 30 μm after transfection. Fresh inhibitor was added back every 24 h.GST Fusion Proteins and in Vitro Binding Assays—GST-c-Src constructs were introduced in Escherichia coli BL21 strain expressing GroES and GroEL chaperones encoded by pRep4-GroESL vector (a generous gift from Drs. Kurt Amrein and Martin Stieger, Roche Research Center, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, NJ) (28Amrein K.E. Takacs B. Stieger M. Molnos J. Flint N.A. Burn P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were produced by growing bacterial cultures to an OD600 of between 0.6 and 0.8 followed by a treatment with 0.1 to 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2-6 h at 30 °C. Bacteria were recovered by centrifugation and kept at -20 °C overnight. Bacterial pellets were thawed at room temperature and lysed as described (13Gingras M.-C. Champagne C. Roy M.A. Lavoie J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 2 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed three times in washing buffer (PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm EDTA). To remove the bound chaperones, beads were incubated in ATP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgSO4, and 2 mm ATP) for 20 min at 37 °C, washed three times in washing buffer, and used for in vitro binding assays. The amount of purified proteins was evaluated on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel. In vitro binding assays were performed as described (13Gingras M.-C. Champagne C. Roy M.A. Lavoie J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) by incubating equal amounts of transfected total cell lysates (1 mg) with 5 μg of freshly prepared immobilized GST fusion proteins overnight at 4 °C. The beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed once in lysis buffer, then twice in lysis buffer containing only 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis with the appropriate antibody. The GST-FLAG-E4orf4 was produced as described (12Lavoie J.N. Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Robert A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1037-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The GST moiety was removed by incubating the beads in protease buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 units of PreScission Protease™ (Amersham BioSciences)) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Recombinant FLAG-E4orf4 protein was recovered in the supernatant, and direct binding to c-Src kinase domain was performed using 5 μg of the indicated GST-c-Src proteins and 200 ng of purified FLAG-E4orf4 protein, as described above. In vitro kinase assays were performed using 250 ng of bound GST-c-Src and 2.5 μg of purified FLAG-E4orf4 or GST in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm Na3Vo4) containing 0.1 mm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-P32]ATP in a 50-μl reaction mixture. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 20 min at 30 °C and stopped by adding 25 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer. Labeled samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography or analyzed by Western blot after electrotransfer on nitrocellulose.Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting, and Antibodies—For coprecipitations, cells on 10-cm plates were lysed with 0.5 ml of modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA: 50 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3Vo4, 15 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), and lysates were immediately diluted with 0.5 ml of HNTG buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol), as described (29Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Ilic D. Klingbeil C.K. Schaefer E. Damsky C.H. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). The lysates were incubated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) or protein G Plus-agarose (Oncogene Research Products) for 20 min on ice and cleared by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit SRC2 anti-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse Ab1 anti-Src (Calbiochem), mAb 327 anti-c-Src (26Shaw G. Morse S. Ararat M. Graham F.L. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 869-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), or rabbit 2419 anti-E4orf4 for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected on protein G-Sepharose or protein G Plus-agarose and washed three times in modified RIPA containing only 1% Triton X-100 before analysis on SDS-PAGE. Equal amounts of immune complexes were resolved on 9 or 11% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and processed for immunoblotting. To disrupt the antigen-antibody complex before reprobing, immunoblots were incubated in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 60 °C, washed in PBS-Tween (0.1%) at room temperature and reprocessed for immunoblotting. The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting analyses: mouse anti-cortactin (4F11, Upstate Biotechnology); mouse anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma); mouse anti-HA (HA.11, Babco); mouse anti-Myc (9E10, Sigma); mouse anti-polyomavirus middle T-antigen (Pab 762) (30Dilworth S.M.

Rabbit 2419, 2418, and 2420 anti-E4orf4 antibodies were described (12Lavoie J.N. Champagne C. Gingras M.C. Robert A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1037-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The anti-phospho-E4orf4 (Tyr42) was produced by injecting rabbits with a chemically synthesized peptide comprising the phosphorylated Tyr42 (HEGVY[PO3H2]IEPEARGRLC), which was coupled to mcKLH (Imject Mariculture keyhole limpet hemocyanin, Pierce) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The serum was purified against the immobilized nonphosphorylated peptide (HEGVYIEPEARGRLC), was absorbed on immobilized phosphorylated peptide using the SulfoLink Kit (Pierce), and was finally purified against phosphotyrosines linked to agarose (O-phospho-l-tyrosine-agarose, Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The specificity of the resulting anti-phospho-E4orf4 (Tyr42) was tested by Western blot analysis of E4orf4 immune complexes and total cell lysates from 293T cells transfected with wild-type FLAG-E4orf4, compared with mutant FLAG-E4orf4 (Y42F) alone or together with c-Src or v-Src to induce maximum tyrosine phosphorylation of Ad2 E4orf4, as described (13Gingras M.-C. Champagne C. Roy M.A. Lavoie J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The antibody reacted specifically with wild-type Ad2 E4orf4 but not with mutant E4orf4 (Y42F), and the specific signal was proportional to the level of tyrosine phosphorylation.RESULTSAd2 E4orf4 Directly Interacts with the Kinase Domain of Src—In several transformed and cancer cell lines expressing Ad2 E4orf4, including 293T, C-33A, and H1299, a membrane-cytoskeleton fraction of E4orf4 is associated with Src family kinases, and inhibition of Src kinases interferes with cell death induction (12Lavoie J.N.

Stat6 is critical for T-helper 2 cell differentiation, B-cell Ig class switch, and allergic diseases; thus, understanding its regulation is of central importance. Phosphorylation is crucial for Stat activity. Whereas Stat6 is phosphorylated on Tyr641, less is known about serine or threonine. We demonstrate in primary human T-cells (>95% CD3+) that IL4 and for the first time IL13 induce Stat6 serine but not threonine phosphorylation that closely paralleled early IL4 receptor α-chain activation (10 min). Stat6 uniquely fails to share a positionally conserved Stat serine phosphorylation sequence; however, known phosphoacceptor sites are proline-flanked. Alanine substitutions of these conserved residues revealed that the transactivation domain, which localized Ser756 but not Ser827 or Ser176, is the IL4-regulated site based on phosphoamino acid analysis. Tyr641 was dispensable for IL4-mediated serine phosphorylation, suggesting that dimerization is not preconditional. Only Stat6 Y641F variant showed a significant effect on IL4-inducible Cϵ DNA-binding and reporter gene expression. Lastly, recent work has shown that protein phosphatase 2A negatively regulates Stat6 (Woetmann, A., Brockdorff, J., Lovato, P., Nielsen, M., Leick, V., Rieneck, K., Svejgaard, A., Geisler, C., and Odum, N. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 2787–2791). We propose this target residue(s) is distinct from Ser756 and may be proximal to Tyr641 at Thr645, a residue conserved only among Stat6 members. The phosphomimic variants T645E or T645D ablated Stat6 activation, whereas polar uncharged substitutions (Gln or Asn) and additional mutants (Ala, Val, or Phe) showed no effect.

T-helper 2 cell overproduction is commonplace during allergic maladies including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis via their ability to activate and recruit monocytes, basophils, mast cells, and eosinophils (1Wills-Karp M.

The overlapping biological effects of IL4 and IL13 are probably derived from their shared use of the IL4 receptor α (IL4Rα) signaling chain and their ability to activate one or more members of the Janus tyrosine kinases, which subsequently result in the activation of secondary effector molecules, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (Stat) (2Kelly-Welch A.E.

Stat6 is one of seven Stat family members that is postulated to be recruited to newly phosphorylated tyrosine residues within activated receptors in the cytoplasm via their Src homology 2 domains, subsequently becoming tyrosine phosphorylated by Janus kinase or Src enzymes on a single and positionally conserved residue that is believed critical for Stat dimerization, nuclear localization, and gene transcription (10Bromberg J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2468-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 11Rane S.G. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3334-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence questions this model by proffering that Stats exist as preformed dimers in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation (12Braunstein J. Brutsaert S. Olson R. Schindler C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34133-34140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Several Stats also have been shown to be serine-phosphorylated in response to cytokine stimulation (13Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nature Rev. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref Scopus (2468) Google Scholar). Mapped Stat phosphoserine sites are localized within proline-rich motifs within the transactivation domain. For Stats 1, 3, 4, 5a, and 5b, this site is positionally conserved, whereas substitution/deletion of this residue/region can affect gene transcription (14Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.C. Schindler C.

Stat6 does not share a positionally conserved phosphoserine acceptor site with other Stat family members; however, it has been shown to be serine-phosphorylated in Ramos Burkitt's lymphoma B-cells (22Pesu M. Takaluoma K. Aittomaki S. Lagerstedt A. Saksela K. Kovanen P.E. Silvennoinen O. Blood. 2000; 95: 494-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and murine splenic B-cells (23Wick K.R. Berton M.T. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) in response to IL4, but the identity of this site(s) has remained elusive. Various effector molecules also have been identified to negatively regulate Stat6 activity including Ship-1, proteasome, and suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (24Haque, S.

Earlier studies have reported that the C-terminal truncation of Stat6, which harbors two proline-flanked serine residues, ablates its transactivation potential (27Moriggl R. Berchtold S. Friedrich K.

Svejgaard A. Geisler C. Odum N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2787-2791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) also has shown that an unknown phosphoserine or threonine residue can negatively regulate Stat6 activity because calyculin A inhibition of the serine-threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) disrupts Stat6 function. Coriticosteroids also can negatively affect Stat6 signals that may be mediated in part through tyrosine phosphorylation (31Biola A. Andreau K. David M. Sturm M. Haake M. Bertoglio J. Pallardy M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To identify these putative phosphoacceptor residues, Stat6 variants were generated against evolutionarily conserved serine residues flanked by prolines and then assessed by metabolic labeling and phosphoamino acid analysis. Herein, we identify the IL4-inducible phosphorylation site and characterize its ability to bind DNA and regulate gene transcription. The first evidence that IL13 modulates Stat6 serine phosphorylation in primary human T-cells also is shown. Lastly, we propose that the calyculin A-sensitive residue is distinct from the IL4-inducible serine site and, alternatively, that PP2A may target Thr645 with its phosphomimic ability to suppress Stat6 function. Human T-lymphocytes obtained from normal donors were purified as described previously (32Kirken R.A. Erwin R.A. Taub D. Murphy W.J. Behbod F. Wang L. Pericle F. Farrar W.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin (50 IU/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. T-lymphocytes were activated for 72 h with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (1 μg/ml) and were subsequently made quiescent by washing and incubating for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% fetal calf serum before exposure to cytokines. Cells were stimulated with recombinant human IL4 or IL13 (catalog number 200-13, Pepro Tech or catalog number 213-IL, R&D system,) at 37 °C as indicated below. HEK293 and COS-7 cells obtained from ATCC were grown in the same medium in the absence of PHA. Approximately 1 × 108 T-cells or 1 × 107 transfected cells were then stimulated with medium or 100 nm IL4 or IL13 at 37 °C as indicated in the corresponding figure legends. Cell pellets were frozen at –70 °C until use. PHA-activated T-lymphocytes were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled clone HIT3a (anti-CD3), anti-CD56 for Natural Killer cells, anti-CD14 for monocytes, and phosphatidylethanolamine-labeled anti-CD19 for B-lymphocytes. Antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences as described previously (32Kirken R.A. Erwin R.A. Taub D. Murphy W.J. Behbod F. Wang L. Pericle F. Farrar W.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed with a FAC-Scan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cells were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (108 cells/ml) and clarified by centrifugation as described previously (33Kirken R.A. Rui H. Malabarba M.G. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19136-19141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Supernatants were incubated with 5 μl/ml polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against peptides derived from the extreme C termini of murine forms of Stat6 (catalog number AX56, Advantex Bioreagents, Conroe, TX) or monoclonal anti-His6 antibody (catalog number MMs-156R, BaBCO). Blots were Western blotted with monoclonal mouse antiphosphotyrosine (catalog number 05-321, UBI, 4G10), anti-Stat6, IL4Rα (R&D Systems) or anti-His6 antibody at 1:1000 as indicated previously (32Kirken R.A. Erwin R.A. Taub D. Murphy W.J. Behbod F. Wang L. Pericle F. Farrar W.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For serine-phosphatase inhibitor experiments, cells were preincubated with ethanol as mock control or varying concentrations of calyculin A (catalog number C-5552, Sigma) as described in the figure legends. For all of the samples, total protein was determined by BCA method (Pierce). Stat6 human clone and empty vector pcDNA3.1/GS were purchased from Invitrogen. Mutants of Stat6 were prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (catalog number 200518, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with oligonucleotide primers designed to alter serine residues to alanines, tyrosine to phenylalanine, or threonine to one of several amino acids. The following mutants of human Stat6 were generated: S176A (AGT to GCC); S756A (AGC to GCC); S827A (TCC to GCC); Y641F (TAT to TTT); and Thr645 (ACC) to Glu (GAA), Ala (GCC), Gln (CAA), Val (GTA), Phe (TTC), Asp (GAC), or Asn (AAT). Before use, the DNA sequence of each mutant was verified. Transfections were performed in either HEK293 or COS-7 cells by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (catalog number 1-814-443, Roche Applied Science) using 2 μg of the Stat6 plasmids/subconfluent COS-7 or HEK293 in 100-mm dishes, and after 48 h, cells were stimulated with 100 nm recombinant human IL4 for 20 min at 37 °C and then immunoprecipitated as described above or subjected to luciferase assay. Luciferase and β-Galactosidase Assays—HEK293 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of Stat6 wild type (WT) or variant plasmids, 1 μg of a triple repeat of the Cϵ gene promoter linked to the pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and 0.1 μg of the pCH110 plasmid containing the β-galactosidase gene as described previously (18Yamashita H. Xu J. Erwin R.A. Farrar W.L. Kirken R.A. Rui H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30218-30224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). After 32 h, cells were stimulated with 1 nm recombinant human IL4 for 16 h at 37 °C. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined using the Dual-Light kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (catalog number BD100LP, Tropix). To correct for differences in transfection efficiencies, luciferase activities were normalized to the β-galactosidase values in each individual sample. The results presented are representative data minimally from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Transfected cells expressing Stat6 WT or variants were subsequently treated without or with 100 nm human IL4 for 15 min and pelleted by centrifugation, and nuclear extracts were isolated and stored at –70 °C as described previously (34Behbod F. Erwin-Cohen R.A. Wang M.E. Trawick B.W. Qu X. Verani R. Kahan B.D. Stepkowski S.M. Kirken R.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3724-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were reacted with a Stat6 DNA binding element Cϵ that had been labeled with [α-32P]ATP (4Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were preincubated with 1 μg of mouse isotype control or His6 antisera at 4 °C for 1 h. Samples were then incubated with probe for an additional 15 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.25× Tris borate EDTA that was prerun in 0.25× Tris borate EDTA buffer for 1 h at 100 V. After the loading of samples, gels were run at room temperature for 2 h at 150 V. Gels were then dried by heating under vacuum and exposed to film at –70 °C. PHA-activated T-cells or transfected cells were metabolically labeled with 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (ICN Radiochemicals) for 2 h at 37 °C, stimulated with 100 nm human IL4 or IL13 for 20 min, and then lysed and immunoprecipitated as described previously (35Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Xu J. DaSilva L. Erwin R.A. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Rui H. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15459-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography, and bands corresponding to Stat6 proteins were excised and exposed to limited hydrolysis in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 60 min. Samples were then dried, resuspended in water with phosphoamino acid standards, and spotted onto a thin layer cellulose acetate gel. One-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis was performed at 1500 V for 40 min in buffer containing pyridine:acetic acid:water at a 10:100:1890 ratio. Standards were visualized with ninhydrin, and samples were analyzed by autoradiography as described previously (35Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Xu J. DaSilva L. Erwin R.A. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Rui H. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15459-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A HEK293 stable cell line expressing the WT Stat6 plasmid was stimulated with 200 nm CA for 40 min at 37 °C, and Stat6 was immunocaptured and separated on SDS-PAGE as described above. The Coomassie Blue-stained protein was extracted and digested with trypsin, and peptides were isolated as described previously (36Knotts T.A. Orkiszewski R.S. Cook R.G. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8474-8483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The identification of phosphorylated peptides was performed next on a PE Sciex (Foster City, CA) API 3000 tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a Protana (Odense, Denmark) nanoelectrospray source. The samples were dissolved in an aqueous solution of 50% methanol and 1% formic acid, and 2–3 μl were deposited in the gold/palladium-coated glass nanoelectrospray capillaries. The samples were analyzed for phosphorylated peptide identification using negative ion precursor ion scanning for m/z 79.1 with nitrogen as the collision gas and collision energy of 100 eV. Positive ion full-scanning spectra were then recorded utilizing the first quadrupole as the mass filter and a cone potential of 70 V. Product ion spectra of the appropriate positively charged precursor ions then were recorded to identify the site of phosphorylation with nitrogen as the collision gas and collision energies of 20–40 eV (36Knotts T.A.

IL4 and IL13 Induce Tyrosine and Serine Phosphorylation of Stat6 in PHA-activated Human T-cells—To investigate the biological regulation of Stat6 driven by IL4 or IL13 in T-lymphocytes, primary human T-cells were isolated and activated for 72 h with PHA, stained, and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis for contaminating Natural Killer cells (CD56), B-cells (CD19), and monocytes (CD14). T-cells (CD3+) represented 95% of this cell population (Fig. 1A). Because Stat6 may be recruited to the IL4Rα via three phosphorylated tyrosine residues (37Smerz-Bertling C. Duschl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 966-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 38Ryan J.J. McReynolds L.J. Keegan A. Wang L.H. Garfein E. Rothman P. Nelms K. Paul W.E.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 113-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we first examined the receptor tyrosine phosphorylation driven by IL4 and IL13 from 0 to 60 min to determine the time point for maximal phosphorylation. The immunoprecipitated receptor was subsequently immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. The IL4Rα attained maximal tyrosine phosphorylation levels by either cytokine that peaked at 5–10 min (Fig. 1B, lanes b and c and lanes h and i). In comparison, Stat6 recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr641 showed a slightly protracted phosphorylation profile with detectable phosphorylation observed within 2.5 min and measured over the entire 40-min time course. (Fig. 1C) (27Moriggl R. Berchtold S. Friedrich K. Standke G.J. Kammer W. Heim M. Wissler M. Stocklin E. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3663-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Lu B. Reichel M. Fisher D.A. Smith J.F. Rothman P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1255-1264PubMed Google Scholar). IL4 was more robust in its ability to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of both effector molecules against equally loaded samples (Fig. 1, B and C, lower panels). Previous studies have shown that IL4 induced Stat6 serine phosphorylation in Ramos Burkitt's lymphoma B cells (22Pesu M. Takaluoma K. Aittomaki S. Lagerstedt A. Saksela K. Kovanen P.E. Silvennoinen O. Blood. 2000; 95: 494-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and murine splenic B-cells (23Wick K.R. Berton M.T. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To investigate whether IL4 or IL13 is competent to induce a Stat6 serine phosphorylation in primary human T-cells, cells were radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Given the above activation kinetics of the IL4Rα and Stat6, cells were stimulated with either IL4 or IL13 for 20 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Stat6 antibodies and subjected to protein separation. A single Coomassie Blue-stainable protein band was observed in each lane with an apparent molecular mass of 113 kDa, which corresponded with the autoradiograph (Fig. 1D, lower panel). Each band was excised and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis. Autoradiography revealed that the Stat6 protein showed radiolabeled phosphate incorporation into tyrosine and serine, but not threonine residues, in response to IL4 or IL13 stimulation of primary T-cells (Fig. 1D, lanes b and c). Effect of Alanine Substitution of Serines 176, 756, and 827 or Tyrosine 641 of Stat6 as Judged by Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—All of the growth factor-mediated Stat serine phosphorylation sites mapped to date are flanked by one or more proline residues (11Rane S.G. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3334-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To investigate the location of the Stat6 serine phosphorylation site(s), we identified only three evolutionarily conserved residues that met the criteria. This included Ser176 found in the helical coiled-coiled domain, which promotes protein-protein interaction, and two that localized to the transactivation domain (Ser756 and Ser827) as depicted in Fig. 2A. To determine whether these sites were the putative IL4-IL13-inducible serine sites, HEK293 or COS-7 cells that express functional IL4 receptors but low to undetectable levels of Stat6 were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for WT or mutant forms of Stat6. Cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with or without 100 nm IL4 and immunopurified Stat6 via epitope capture, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 2, B and C, lower panels). The radiolabeled proteins were then excised and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis after limited acid hydrolysis (Fig. 2, B and C, upper panels, lanes a–j). WT Stat6 showed IL4-inducible tyrosine and serine phosphorylation, whereas only the mutation of S756A (lane f) showed inhibition of serine phosphorylation that was reduced to background levels in both cell types while tyrosine phosphorylation was not affected. It is concluded from these studies that Ser756 is the IL4-regulated Stat6 serine phosphorylation site. Stat6 did show some variability in COS-7 versus HEK293 cells since IL4-inducible threonine phosphorylation was occasionally but not reproducibly detected (panel C, lanes a and b). Lastly, the mutation of the conserved Y641F retained the ability to become serine-phosphorylated in both cell lines, suggesting that tyrosine and serine phosphorylation events can be mutually exclusive. Analysis of DNA Binding Activities of Stat6 Mutants—The ability of wild type protein and Stat6 mutants to bind to an oligonucleotide probe was evaluated (Fig. 3). Protein nuclear extracts isolated from IL4-stimulated HEK293-Stat6-transfected plasmids were found to be fully capable of forming DNA complexes with a 32P-labeled probe with the exception of the Y641F variant (lane l). These results suggest that unlike Tyr641 (27Moriggl R. Berchtold S. Friedrich K. Standke G.J. Kammer W. Heim M. Wissler M. Stocklin E. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3663-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Lu B. Reichel M. Fisher D.A. Smith J.F. Rothman P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1255-1264PubMed Google Scholar), Ser756 phosphorylation is not essential for nuclear localization or Stat6 DNA binding (lane h). Recent work by Braunstein et al. (12Braunstein J. Brutsaert S. Olson R. Schindler C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34133-34140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) has shown that Stat1 and Stat3 exist as preformed dimers in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation yet cannot bind DNA (12Braunstein J. Brutsaert S. Olson R. Schindler C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34133-34140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Here we show that, although IL4 can induce Stat6 serine phosphorylation in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of Ser756 alone is not sufficient to promote DNA binding (Fig. 3, lanes k and l). Whether serine phosphorylation may affect the oligomeric state of Stat6 remains to be determined. Effect of Mutating Ser176, Ser756, Ser827, and Tyr641 on IL4-induced Transcription—Earlier work (27Moriggl R. Berchtold S. Friedrich K. Standke G.J. Kammer W. Heim M. Wissler M. Stocklin E. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3663-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) shows that the truncated Stat6Δ677 variant, void of two of three proline-flanked serines, is critical for gene expression. To analyze the role of all of the conserved proline-juxtaposed serines on Stat6 transactivation potential including Ser756, luciferase reporter assays were performed utilizing the Cϵ gene promoter.

However, the side effects of GH have been poorly defined. In this study we determined the effect of GH on wound repair and its mechanisms of action at the wound site. For this purpose, we performed wound healing studies in transgenic mice overexpressing GH. Full thickness incisional and excisional wounds of transgenic animals developed extensive, highly vascularized granulation tissue. However, wound bursting strength was not increased. Wound closure was strongly delayed as a result of enhanced granulation tissue formation and impaired wound contraction. The latter effect is most likely due to a significantly reduced number of myofibroblasts at the wound site. By using in vitro studies with stressed collagen lattices, we identified GH as an inhibitor of transforming growth factor β-induced myofibroblast differentiation, resulting in a reduction in fibroblast contractile activity. These results revealed novel roles of GH in angiogenesis and myofibroblast differentiation, which are most likely not mediated via insulin-like growth factors at the wound site. Furthermore, our data suggested that systemic GH treatment is detrimental for wound healing in healthy individuals.

Furthermore, our data suggested that systemic GH treatment is detrimental for wound healing in healthy individuals. Injury to the skin initiates a series of events, which finally lead to at least partial reconstruction of the wounded tissue (1Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3615) Google Scholar). The important role of locally acting cytokines and growth factors in wound repair is well documented (2Werner S. Grose R. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 835-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). However, crucial functions of endocrine-acting hormones have only recently been recognized (3Ashcroft G.S. Dodsworth J. van Boxtel E. Tarnuzzer R.W. Horan M.A. Schultz G.S. Ferguson M.W. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1209-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 4Grose R. Werner S. Kessler D. Tuckermann J.

Investig. 2002; 110: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). One of the hormones, which are thought to influence the repair process, is growth hormone (GH). 1The abbreviations used are: GH, growth hormone; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFBPs, IGF-binding proteins; bGH, bovine GH; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor β1; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; HE, hyperproliferative epithelium; FCS, fetal calf serum.1The abbreviations used are: GH, growth hormone; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IGFBPs, IGF-binding proteins; bGH, bovine GH; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor β1; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; HE, hyperproliferative epithelium; FCS, fetal calf serum. This hormone is successfully used for the treatment of growth defects in children. In addition, an increasing number of healthy adult patients receive GH therapy as an anti-aging strategy (6Cummings D.E. Merriam G.R. Annu. Rev. Med. 2003; 54: 513-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the side effects of GH treatment have been poorly defined, and it is as yet unclear if GH affects the wound healing process in healthy individuals. Treatment with recombinant GH has been used in patients with severe burn injuries, and in most studies enhanced rates of wound healing and patient survival were observed (7Lal S.O. Wolf S.E. Herndon D.N. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2000; 10: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, GH was shown to stimulate granulation tissue formation and biomechanical wound strength in animal models of impaired healing (8Steenfos H.H. Jansson J.O. J. Endocrinol. 1992; 132: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Seyer-Hansen M. Andreassen T.T. Jorgensen P.H. Oxlund H. Eur. Surg.

Surg. 1999; 104: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), although a lack of efficacy of GH has also been reported (12Seyer-Hansen M. Andreasen T.T. Oxlund H. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 1999; 9: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Welsh K.M. Lamit M. Morhenn V.B. J. Dermatol. Surg. Oncol. 1991; 17: 942-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of GH in wound repair remains to be determined. In particular, the mechanisms of GH action in this process have not yet been elucidated. Many effects of GH are mediated via the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system (14Green H. Morikawa M. Nixon T. Differentiation. 1985; 29: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), suggesting that this might also be a mechanism of GH action in the skin. IGF-I is a mitogen for keratinocytes (15Eming S.A. Snow R.G. Yarmush M.L. Morgan J.R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 113-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and it stimulates collagen, glycosaminoglycan, and proteoglycan synthesis by dermal fibroblasts (16Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. Rosenfeld R. Roberts C. Contemporary Endocrinology; The IGF System. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 227-254Google Scholar, 17Kuroda K. Utani A. Hamasaki Y. Shinkai H. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2001; 26: 156-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It exerts its effects in concert with a family of six IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) that control the availability of IGF for signaling through its receptor in a complex manner. Whereas IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-4 have a predominantly negative effect on IGF activity, IGFBP-5 can act to enhance IGF signaling but only when associated with the surface extracellular matrix of target cells (16Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. Rosenfeld R. Roberts C. Contemporary Endocrinology; The IGF System. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 227-254Google Scholar, 18Clemmons D.R. Rosenfeld R. Roberts Jr., C. Contemporary Endocrinology; The IGF System. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 273-279Google Scholar). In addition, IGFBPs also have IGF-independent effects on cell growth (19Schneider M.R. Wolf E. Hoeflich A. Lahm H. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 172: 423-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Most interesting, imbalances in the IGF/IGFBP system are associated with wound healing abnormalities. Thus, up-regulation of IGF or IGFBPs was detected in hypertrophic scars, whereas decreased IGF levels were found in diabetic skin and foot ulcers and in the wounds of healing-impaired diabetic or glucocorticoid-treated rats or mice (2Werner S. Grose R. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 835-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, the effect of members of the IGF system on dermal tissue repair has been analyzed. Local IGF gene therapy or protein treatment improved the wound healing process in different animal models (20Lynch S.E. Colvin R.B. Antoniades H.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 84: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 21Jyung R.W. Mustoe J.A. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Surgery. 1994; 115: 233-239PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bitar M.S. Horm. Metab.

Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, raising the serum levels of IGF-I by systemic application did not improve wound healing, although GH was effective in the same experimental set-up, possibly via induction of IGF-I at the wound site (24Dunaiski V. Belford D.A. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2002; 12: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These findings, together with the obvious importance of the GH/IGF system in the homeostasis of the skin, prompted us to analyze the wound healing process in transgenic mice overexpressing bovine GH (bGH) under a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter. These mice have greatly elevated postnatal serum GH levels of ∼2000 ng/ml (compared with less than 10 ng/ml endogenous hormone in control mice) and serum IGF-I levels that are 2-3 times higher than those of control littermates. In contrast to growth hormone treatment models, these animals allow long term studies without immunologic complications (25Wolf E. Wanke R. Zutphen L.F.M. van der Meer M. Welfare of Transgenic Animals. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1996: 26-47Google Scholar). Most interesting, the skin of these animals has a significantly increased absolute (males and females) and relative weight (males only) (26Wanke R. Milz S. Rieger N. Ogiolda L. Renner-Muller I. Brem G. Hermanns W. Wolf E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 967-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Hoeflich A. Nedbal S. Blum W.F. Erhard M. Lahm H. Brem G. Kolb H.J. Wanke R. Wolf E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1889-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). GH transgenic males develop a phenotype, which has been likened to an “oversized coat.” Although skin alterations in females are moderate, males develop a pronounced dermal hypertrophy with dermal fibrosis and decreased subcutaneous adipose tissue. This male-specific phenotype is dependent on androgen production (26Wanke R. Milz S. Rieger N. Ogiolda L. Renner-Muller I. Brem G. Hermanns W. Wolf E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 967-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here we show that both transgenic males and females suffer from severe wound healing abnormalities. Animals, Wounding and Preparation of Wound Tissue—Hemizygous phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-bGH transgenic mice in an NMRI outbred background were bred with C57BL/6 wild-type mice. Transgenic and nontransgenic littermates were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (10 g/liter)/xylazine (8 g/liter) solution (250 μl/25 g body weight). Four full thickness excisional wounds, 5 mm diameter each, were made on either side of the dorsal midline by excising skin and panniculus carnosus. Wounds were left uncovered and harvested 5 or 13 days after injury. Mice were housed individually during the healing period. For expression analyses, two complete wounds from each animal including 2 mm of the epithelial margins were excised and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nonwounded back skin served as a control. For histological analysis the complete wounds were isolated, bisected, fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (for histology) or 95% ethanol, 1% acetic acid (for immunofluorescence, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) staining, and morphometry), and embedded in paraffin. Sections (7 μm) from the middle of the wound were stained using the Masson trichrome procedure. Morphometric measurements of area and length were performed on BrdUrd-stained sections using the OpenLab software (Improvision Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) and are represented as single data points and median (see Figs. 2, B and C, and 4, I and J). Alternatively, all values ranging from 25% below and above the median were represented as boxes (25th to 75th percentile). In this case the highest and lowest values were also indicated as bars (see Figs. 2D and 4E). Statistical significance of differences was determined by the Mann-Whitney U test for non-Gaussian distribution. All experiments with animals were carried out with permission from the local veterinary authorities.Fig. 4Severely delayed wound healing in bGH overexpressing males.

The dorsal region was shaved and treated with a depilatory agent (Pilca Perfect, Stafford-Miller Continental, Oevel, Belgium). Two full thickness incisions (1 cm) were made, one anterior and one posterior, dorsal site, and the skin margins were closed with strips of a wound plaster (Fixomull stretch, Beiersdorf, Hamburg, Germany). Mice were sacrificed on day 5 post-wounding, and bursting strength of the wounds was determined in situ using the BTC-2000 system (SRLI Technologies, Nashville, TN) according to the manufacturer's protocol for the non-human disruptive linear incision analysis. Data are shown as median, 25th to 75th percentile, and highest and lowest value. Statistical significance of differences in tensile strength between the groups was determined by the Mann-Whitney U test. Labeling with BrdUrd—BrdUrd labeling was performed as described (28Skalli O. Ropraz P. Trzeciak A. Benzonana G. Gillessen D. Gabbiani G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2787-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Sections (7 μm) from the middle of the wound were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody directed against BrdUrd (Roche Diagnostics) and stained with 0.05% diaminobenzidine, 0.01% H2O2. Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry—Acetic acid/ethanol-fixed paraffin sections (7 μm) from the middle of the wound or immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts were incubated with antibodies directed against α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) (anti-αSM-1, IgG2a monoclonal antibody (28Skalli O.

Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma) and F-actin with phalloidin-Alexa488 (Molecular Probes). Subsequently, slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, prior to mounting in Tris/glycerol containing n-propyl gallate, and analyzed using a Leica DM IRBE fluorescence microscope equipped with a TCSNT confocal laser system or a Leica DM RXA2 upright microscope, equipped with a laser-scanning confocal head (TCS SP2 AOBS). Conventional immunofluorescence images were analyzed on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope. Quantification of α-SMA Expression by Fluorescence Image Analysis—Expression levels of α-SMA in sections of wound granulation tissue were quantified as described (30Hinz B. Mastrangelo D. Iselin C.E. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1009-1020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were triple-immunostained for α-SMA, desmin, and cell nuclei, and confocal digital images were taken using a Plan-Neofluar ×40/1.3 objective (Zeiss) mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M, equipped with a spinning disk Nipkow confocal head (Yokogawa CSU10, Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany), CoolSNAP-HQ monochrome digital CCD camera (Photometrics, Roper Scientific, Inc., Trenton, NJ), and image acquisition software (MetaMorph, Universal Imaging Corp. Downington, PA). For each image a region of interest was manually selected, including the granulation tissue, and all further automatic processing was restricted to this region. First, desmin staining, specific for vascular smooth muscle cells, was subtracted from α-SMA and DAPI images in order to exclude vessels from α-SMA quantification. Second, α-SMA expression was analyzed by calculating the mean pixel intensity of the whole region of interest after background correction and related to the number of cell nuclei obtained from the desmin-corrected DAPI image. Tissue was collected from three animals per experimental condition; three sections were prepared per animal, and four regions of interest were analyzed per section. Immunohistochemistry and Quantification of Blood Vessels—For immunohistochemistry, sections were deparaffinized and treated for 40 min at room temperature with 1.5% H2O2 in methanol to block endogenous peroxidases. After a 30-min incubation with 10% rabbit serum, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the PECAM-1 antibody, followed by a 1-h incubation with biotinylated donkey anti-rat IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Detection was performed with the peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories), as described by the manufacturer. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted, and analyzed using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam HRc camera. Stained vessels within an area of 0.2 × 0.5 mm below the hyperproliferative epithelium were counted. Relaxed and Stressed Collagen Lattice Contraction—To determine the effect of GH on the contractile activity of immortalized embryonic murine fibroblasts, cells were grown in stressed collagen lattices (31Hinz B. Celetta G. Tomasek J.J. Gabbiani G. Chaponnier C Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2730-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) at 1.75 × 105 cells/ml for 5 days (with our without 1 ng/ml TGF-β1). Attached lattices were then released, and diameter reduction after 30 min was normalized to the initial gel diameter. In one experimental series, mouse sera and GH were added from the beginning of the 5-day (long term) culture and in a second series only 5 h (short term) prior to gel release. Tractional cell forces were assessed using relaxed, free-floating collagen lattices as described (32Kessler D. Dethlefsen S. Haase I. Plomann M. Hirche F. Krieg T. Eckes B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36575-36585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). 9 × 104 cells/ml gel were seeded into 6-cm Petri dishes, and collagen gel areas were measured 12 h later. A minimum of 3 lattices was assayed, and experiments were performed in duplicates. Acetic Acid Extraction of Proteins from Skin—Skin samples were homogenized in liquid nitrogen and extracted in 1 m acetic acid for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at 11,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was frozen. Pellets were re-extracted in 1 m acetic acid as described above. Supernatants were combined and stored at -20 °C overnight. Before determination of protein concentration, the samples were again centrifuged, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, whereas the newly formed precipitate was discarded. Western Blot Analysis—15 μg of total protein from lysates of 5-day wounds of wild-type and transgenic mice were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with primary antibodies against α-SMA and ED-A fibronectin, stripped, and re-probed for total actin using antibody rabbit antibody (Sigma). Detection was performed with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were digitized with a scanner, and the ratio between all band densities of one blot was calculated by commercial computer software (Image-Quant version 3.3, Amersham Biosciences). Relative protein expression was normalized to the respective values for total actin. Samples from four animals per experimental condition were used to calculate mean protein/total actin ratio. Western Ligand Blotting—Ligand blot analysis of IGFBPs present in the skin was performed according to Ref. 33Hossenlopp P. Seurin D. Segovia Quinson B. Hardouin S. Binoux M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar, with modifications (34Wolf E. Kramer R. Blum W.F. Foll J. Brem G. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1877-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein samples were diluted 1:2 with sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) sucrose), boiled (5 min), and electrophoresed on a 5% stacking/12% separating SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). Blots were blocked with 1% fish gelatin and incubated with 125I-IGF-II (106 cpm per blot). Binding proteins were visualized and quantified by using the PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Radioimmunoassays for IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-2—IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-2 were measured using radioimmunoassays described before (35Bang P. Baxter R.C. Blum W.F. Breier B.H. Clemmons D.R. Hall K.

For all assays, dilution curves of mouse samples were linear and paralleled those of human standards. bGH Transgenic Mice Show Excessive Granulation Tissue Formation and Reduced Wound Closure at Day 5 after Wounding—We generated full thickness excisional wounds in bGH transgenic mice and control littermates, and we sampled the excised wounds for histological analysis at day 5 after injury (14 wounds from 7 transgenic males, 12 wounds from 6 wild-type males, 13 wounds from 7 transgenic females, and 14 wounds from 7 wild-type females). At this time point, the inflammatory response is still strong on the one hand, and on the other hand re-epithelialization is already well underway. Furthermore, part of the clot has been replaced by granulation tissue, which consists of inflammatory cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, which deposit large amounts of new extracellular matrix (1Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3615) Google Scholar, 2Werner S. Grose R. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 835-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows representative Masson trichrome-stained sections of wounds from transgenic males and females in comparison to their wild-type littermates. Wounds were much wider in the transgenic animals of both sexes and filled with a large and cell-rich granulation tissue (Fig. 1, A, C, E, and G, arrowheads). A large fraction of the wound was not yet covered by epidermis (Fig. 1, A, C, E, and G, arrows). In the wild-type animals, on the other hand, the granulation tissue was much less extended, and therefore, a significant part of the wound was already covered by newly formed epidermis (Fig. 1, B, D, F, and H, arrows). Finally, the outer margins of the hyperproliferative epithelium (HE) had moved toward each other due to contraction of the wounds (Fig. 1, B, D, F, and H, arrowheads). In addition to the size, the quality of the granulation tissue was also very different between transgenic mice and control animals. Cells had invaded into most parts of the original clot, and a significant amount of matrix had been deposited in bGH-overexpressing mice (see blue collagen staining). By contrast, the loose, spongy tissue characteristic for the blood clot was only partially replaced by granulation tissue in control mice (Fig. 1, B, D, and F). In a few wild-type mice, where most of the clot was replaced by granulation tissue at day 5 after injury (Fig. 1H), the granulation tissue was much less extended compared with transgenic mice. The oval structures that are detectable in the granulation tissue of some transgenic animals were identified as hypertrophic nerve fibers after staining of the sections with an antibody against neurofilament M (data not shown). They were also detected in most control wounds and to a lesser extent in wild-type mice of other mouse strains (data not shown). Therefore, they appear not to be the result of bGH overexpression. To quantify the histological data, one set of sections from one wounding experiment (including 5 wounds from 3 transgenic males, 4 wounds from 2 wild-type males, 4 wounds from 2 transgenic females, and 5 wounds from 3 wild-type females) was used to measure the cross-sectional area of the granulation tissue (Fig. 2A, encircled area) and the progress of wound closure (% of distance covered by epidermis between the wound edges that are indicated by arrowheads in Fig. 1, A-H, and Fig. 2A). Differences in wound closure (p = 0.0159) and granulation tissue area (p = 0.0317) were significant in both sexes (Fig. 2, B and C). To determine the rate of cell proliferation within the hyperproliferative epithelium, the animals were injected with BrdUrd 2 h prior to sacrifice, and sections from the center of the wounds were stained with an antibody directed against BrdUrd. The percentage of stained, proliferating cells was similar in wild-type and transgenic animals (data not shown). Consistent with this finding, the area of the HE, as well as its length along the border between epidermis and dermis, which reflects the rate of keratinocyte migration, was not significantly different between bGH transgenic and wild-type mice (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the reduced wound closure is not the result of delayed re-epithelialization but rather of enhanced granulation tissue formation and reduced wound contraction. Excessive Formation of Granulation Tissue Does Not Lead to a Higher Wound Bursting Strength in bGH Transgenic Mice—To determine whether the formation of a larger and denser granulation tissue in the bGH transgenic animals leads to a functional improvement, we generated incisional wounds on the back of bGH transgenic and wild-type males and females. Because incisional wounds are fully healed at day 5 after injury, we sacrificed the animals at this time point and measured the negative pressure at which the wounds ruptured. No significant improvement of bursting strength in transgenic versus wild-type animals was found; rather, the median bursting strength was slightly higher in both wild-type males and females, compared with bGH transgenic males and females, respectively (Fig. 2D). Similar to the results from excisional wounds, histology of incisional wounds showed an increase, albeit smaller, in the density and volume of the granulation tissue (data not shown). Thus, the excessively dense and thick granulation tissue in bGH transgenic animals does not function to confer a higher bursting strength. Altered Neovascularization in 5-Day Wounds of bGH Transgenic Animals—Analysis of Masson trichrome-stained sections suggested that the number of blood vessels is enhanced in bGH transgenic animals.

Here, we show that glutathione S-transferase (GST)-hKOR C-tail interacted with purified NHERF-1/EBP50, whereas GST or GST-C-tails of μ or δ opioid receptors did not. GST-hKOR C-tail, but not GST, bound HA-NHERF-1/EBP50 transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells and endogenous NHERF-1/EBP50 in opossum kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells (OK cells). The PDZ domain I, but not II, of NHERF-1/EBP50 was involved in the interaction. Association of NHERF-1/EBP50 with hKOR C-tail enhanced oligomerization of NHERF-1/EBP50. NHERF-1/EBP50 was previously shown to regulate Na+/H+-exchanger 3 (NHE3) activities in OK cells. We found stimulation of OK cells with U50,488H significantly enhanced Na+/H+ exchange, which was blocked by naloxone but not by pertussis toxin pretreatment, indicating it is mediated by KORs but independent of Gi/Go proteins. In OKH cells, a subclone of OK cells expressing a much lower level of NHERF-1/EBP50, U50,488H had no effect on Na+/H+ exchange, although it enhanced p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation via Gi/Go proteins similar to that in OK cells. Stable transfection of NHERF-1/EBP50 into OKH cells restored the stimulatory effect of U50,488H upon Na+/H+ exchange. Thus, NHERF-1/EBP50 binds directly to KOR, and this association plays an important role in accelerating Na+/H+ exchange. We hypothesize that binding of the KOR to NHERF-1/EBP50 facilitates oligomerization of NHERF-1/EBP50, leading to stimulation of NHE3. This study provides the first direct evidence that a G protein-coupled receptor through association with NHERF-1/EBP-50 stimulates NHE3.

Activation of κ opioid receptors in vivo results in many effects, including analgesia (1VonVoigtlander P.F. Lahti R.A. Ludens J.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

At cellular levels, stimulation of κ opioid receptors activates Gi/Go proteins resulting in downstream changes, such as inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, increase in K+ conductance, and decrease in Ca2+ conductance (for a review, see Ref. 5Law P.-Y. Wong Y.H. Loh H.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 516-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and the receptors belong to the rhodopsin subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (8Schwartz T.W. Holst B. Foreman J.C. Johansen T. Textbook of Receptor Pharmacology. CRC Press, New York2002: 81-109Google Scholar).PDZ domains were originally identified in the proteins post-synaptic density-95 (PSD-95), discs-large, and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) as repeats of about 90 amino acids containing the conserved motif Gly-Leu-Gly-Phe. These domains mediate protein-protein interactions by interacting with the last few C-terminal residues of their target proteins (9Saras J. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 10Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Many GPCRs have been shown to interact with PDZ domain-containing proteins, and such interactions play important roles in signal transduction and receptor regulation (for a review, see Ref. 11Bockaert J. Marin P. Dumuis A. Fagni L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1)/ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM)-binding phosphoprotein-50 (EBP50) is a PDZ domain-containing protein. Rabbit NHERF-1 was first purified and cloned (12Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and the human homolog was subsequently cloned, termed EBP50 (13Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) or hNHERF (14Murthy A. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Cordero E. Pinney D. Candia C. Solomon F. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1273-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The term NHERF-1/EBP50 is used throughout this report. NHERF-1/EBP50 is widely distributed in tissues and is particularly enriched in those containing polarized epithelia. NHERF-1/EBP50 is a cofactor essential for cAMP-mediated inhibition of the activity of Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3), a subtype of the Na+/H+ exchangers found in renal apical membranes. Through the ERM-binding domain, NHERF-1/EBP50 binds to the ezrinradixin-moesin family of actin-binding proteins and thus joins NHE3 with the actin cytoskeleton. This complex facilitates NHE3 phosphorylation and hormonal regulation of Na+/H+ exchange (for reviews, see Refs. 15Weinman E.J. Minkoff C. Shenolikar S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F393-F399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 16Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F389-F395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In renal proximal tubules, NHE3 secrets H+ into the lumen that, in turn, leads to the production of HCO–3, which re-enters the blood. Such NHE3-initiated ion transport mediates the re-absorption of NaCl and NaHCO3.Hall et al. (17Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) have shown that NHERF-1/EBP50 is associated with the β2-AR, and this interaction plays an important role in β2-AR-mediated regulation of the NHE3 activity independent of G proteins. This finding resolves the paradox, that activation of β2-AR enhances intracellular cAMP but does not inhibit NHE3 activity. The observation revealed a mechanism by which GPCRs, such as β2-AR, through their associated protein(s), influence cellular signaling events independent of G proteins.We have recently demonstrated that NHERF-1/EBP50 co-immunoprecipitates with the human κ opioid receptor (hKOR) via its first PDZ domain (18Li J.-G. Chen C. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This association appears to serve as a signal for internalized hKOR to be sorted to the recycling pathway and thus blocks U50,488H-induced down-regulation of the hKOR, without affecting its internalization (18Li J.-G. Chen C. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The C-terminal sequence of the hKOR, NKPV, is distinctly different from the sequence, D(S/T)XL, the optimal C-terminal motif in the β2-AR for NHERF-1/EBP50 binding (19Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman, Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar).Although NHERF-1/EBP50 co-immunoprecipitates with the hKOR and it appears to be a PDZ domain-mediated interaction (18Li J.-G. Chen C. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether NHERF-1/EBP50 binds directly to the C-terminal domain of the hKOR. In this study, we employed the pull-down techniques using the fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the C-terminal domain of the hKOR (GST-hKOR C-tail) to examine its interaction with NHERF-1/EBP50, purified from a bacterial expression system, expressed in CHO cells and endogenously expressed in OK cells, a cell line derived from opossum kidney proximal tubules. As in OK cells, NHERF-1/EBP50 is known to be a regulator of NHE3 (16Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F389-F395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.H.

Papakonstanti E. Stournaras C. Emmanouel D.S. Castanas E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); thus, we examined in these cells whether activation of the κ opioid receptor regulates Na+/H+ exchange, and, if so, whether NHERF-1/EBP50 plays a role.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—OK cells and minimum essential medium were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA), OKH cells were kindly provided by Dr. Judith A.

The C-terminal domain of the hKOR-(334–380), hmor-(336–394) or hdor-(322–372), NHERF-1/EBP50 (full-length, FL), NHERF-1/EBP50-(1–151) (PDZ domain I, DI), or NHERF-1/EBP50-(152–358) (PDZ domain II, DII) was cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 bacterial expression system, which contains the GST sequence 5′ to the inserted sequence, and transformed into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RP to express. The E. coli cells overexpressing GST fusion proteins or GST were solubilized in BugBuster protein extraction reagent at room temperature for 30 min according to the Novagen manual, and then adsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (15 min at room temperature) and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The beads were ready for pull-down analysis, and the amounts of loaded proteins were semiquantified by use of Coomassie Blue staining (SDS-gels) and Ponceau S staining (PVDF membranes), respectively. In addition, those proteins used for overlay assays were further eluted from the beads with 10 mm glutathione/50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer, and glutathione was removed through multiple rounds of concentration and dilution using Microcon™ centrifugal filter devices with fresh buffer of 25 mm Tris/0.8% NaCl/0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.6) (TBS-T buffer). The concentrations of the purified proteins were determined by using a BCA protein assay kit.cDNA Construction and Purification of His6/S Tag-NHERF-1/EBP50 —NHERF-1/EBP50 cDNA was cloned into the pET-30a(+) bacterial expression vector, which carries N-terminal His6 tag and S tag, and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The protein was purified from medium by use of ProBond™ nickel-chelating resin according to the manufacturer's instructions. The His6 tag fusion proteins were eluted from the beads with 0.5 m imidazole/500 mm NaCl/50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at room temperature for 20 min. Imidazole was removed in a similar way so as to remove glutathione as above, and the protein concentration was detected by using a BCA protein assay kit.Cell Culture—CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Opossum kidney proximal tubule epithelium cells (OK, OKH, and OKH-N1 cells) were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). OKH-N1 cells, transfected stably with full-length rabbit NHERF-1/EBP50 in the pcDNA3.1(+)-Hygro vector, were maintained in the presence of 0.25 mg/ml hygromycin B.Assessment of Direct Protein-Protein Interactions by Pull-down Techniques—This assessment was performed as described by Einarson and Orlinick (21Einarson M.B. Orlinick J.R. Golemis E. Protein-Protein Interaction. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor2002: 37-57Google Scholar).Interaction of hKOR-C-tail with Purified NHERF-1/EBP50 —GST (control), GST-hKOR C-tail, GST-hmor C-tail, or GST-hdor C-tail bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads at ∼10 μg of each protein/20 μl of resin, with less loading of GST-hKOR C-tail due to its poor binding capability. The beads (20 μl each) were incubated with purified His6/S-tag-NHERF-1/EBP50 (10 μg), respectively, in 1 ml of TBS-T buffer containing 3% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation for 1 h. The beads were washed twice with ice-cold 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T buffer and three times with TBS-T buffer to remove nonspecific binding. The Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with 40 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min to dissociate proteins from beads and centrifuged to remove beads. The supernatants (20 μl of each) were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was transferred to Immobilon™-P PVDF membrane, which was rinsed three times with TBS-T buffer and blocked with 2% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T buffer. The His6/S tag-NHERF-1/EBP50 fusion protein was detected by blotting with an S-protein HRP conjugate (1:5000), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. The membranes was also stained with 0.1% Ponceau S in 5% acetic acid to reveal the relative loading amounts of the GST (26 kDa), GST-hKOR C-tail (34 kDa), GST-hmor C-tail (37 kDa), and GST-hdor C-tail (35 kDa).Interaction of hKOR-C-tail with HA-NHERF-1/EBP50 or Its Fragment Expressed in CHO Cells—CHO cells were transiently transfected with 8 μg/100-mm dish of HA-NHERF-1/EBP50 in pcDNA3, HA-NHERF-1/EBP50-(1–151) (PDZ domain I (DI)) in pBK/CMV, or HA-NHERF-1/EBP50-(152–358) (PDZ domain II (DII)) in pBK/CMV by use of LipofectAMINE (50 μl) following the manufacturer's instructions. 2–3 days after transfection, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl/150 mm NaCl/1 mm EDTA/1% (v/v) Triton X-100), and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads pre-loaded with either GST or GST-hKOR-C-tail as described as above in the 1% Triton X-100/1 mm EDTA/TBS buffer (25 mm Tris/150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation overnight. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold TBS-T buffer. The proteins were eluted from the beads with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved with 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon™-P PVDF membranes. HA fusion proteins were detected with immunoblotting using monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1: 4000) followed by goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents.Interaction of hKOR-C-tail with Endogenous NHERF-1/EBP50 in OK Cells—OK cells (∼1 × 107) were lysed and solubilized with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) in the presence of Roche Applied Science protease inhibitors mixture (1 tablet/10 ml) for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged (16,000 × g, 30 min). The supernatants were used for pull-down experiments using beads loaded with either GST-hKOR C-tail or GST as described as above, except that NHERF-1/EBP50 was detected by immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-rabbit NHERF-1/EBP50 antibody (1:500) followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugate and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents.Detection of NHERF-1/EBP50 Oligomerization by Overlay Assays— This was performed according the method of Lau and Hall (22Lau A.G. Hall R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8572-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Purified GST and GST fusion proteins (GST-FL, GST-DI, and GST-DII) (2 μg/lane) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were incubated with purified His6-S.tag-NHERF-1/EBP50 (10 μg/ml) alone or in the presence of GST or GST-hKOR C-tail at concentration of 10 μg/ml in TBS-T containing 5% nonfat milk overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times with 10 ml of TBS-T buffer (10 min each time) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with S-protein horseradish peroxidase conjugate at dilution of 1:4000 in the TBS-T buffer for detection of overlaid His6-S.tag-NHERF-1/EBP50 proteins. Finally, membrane were washed as above and visualized via enhanced chemiluminescence using an ECL kit.p42/p44 MAP Kinase Phosphorylation—OK and OKH cells were transferred to 12-well plates, grown overnight, and changed to serum-free medium for 3 h approximately overnight to reduce basal MAP kinase phosphorylation. Cells were treated with or without U50,488H (1 μm), naloxone (10 μm), or nor-BNI (1 μm) at 37 °C for 5 min and then lysed with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For PTX-treated cells, cells were pre-treated with PTX (100 ng/ml, 12–16 h) before incubation with any drugs. Aliquots of the lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon™-P PVDF membranes. Phosphorylated MAP kinase was detected by Western blot using a PhosphoPlus p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were then stripped by incubating at 50 °C for 30 min with 0.1 mm 2-mecaptoethanol and 2% SDS in 62.5 mm Tris buffer (pH 6.8) and rinsed twice with TBS-T buffer at room temp. Total p44/42 MAP kinase on the membranes was detected by Western blot using p44/42 MAP kinase antibody. Images were captured with a FUJIFILM LAS-1000 imaging system and analyzed with ImageGauge software.Determination of Intracellular pH (pHi) in OK, OKH, or OKH-N1 cells—pHi of cells was determined by microphotometry of the fluorescence emission of the pH-sensitive dye, acetoxymethyl ester of 2′, 7′bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF-AM), using dual wavelength excitation according to the method of Weinman et al. (23Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wade J.B. Shenolikar S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F374-F380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in serum-free medium for overnight on 40-mm glass coverslips to full confluence and loaded with 6.5 μm BCECF-AM in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 35 mm NH4Cl, 90 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm tetramethylammonium (TMA)-PO4, and 25 mm glucose for 20 min at room temperature. Coverslips were transferred to an FSC2 chamber (Bioptechs) and rapidly perfused at a constant flow rate with solutions warmed to 37 °C. Cells were acidified for 5 min with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 130 mm TMA-Cl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm TMA-PO4, and 25 mm glucose. Na+/H+ exchange transport was initiated by substituting 130 mm NaCl for 130 mm TMA-Cl in the perfusion solution. BCECF fluorescence was measured at excitation wavelengths of 500 and 440 nm and an emission wavelength of 550 nm. The NH4Cl pulse was used to achieve an initial pHi of about 6.0, and only cells with initial pHi values between 5.8 and 6.0 were included for analyses. Na+/H+ exchange, expressed as change in pHi (ΔpHi)/10 s, represented the initial slope of transport activity measured between 5 and 20 s of sodium-dependent pHi recovery. Over this brief time period, the relationship between pHi and time was essentially linear. To examine the effects of U50,488H and other opioid drugs on Na+/H+ exchanger activity, cells were pretreated with the drug(s) during the final 15 min of dye loading and continuously throughout the perfusion process. For PTX-treated cells, cells were pretreated with PTX (100 ng/ml, 12–16 h) before U50,488H treatment. At the end of each experiment, the cells were equilibrated in pH clamp media containing 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm MOPS, 115 mm KCl, 14 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm TMA-PO4, 25 mm glucose, and 10 μm nigericin at pH 6.2 and 7.3 for calibration of fluorescence intensity with pH. On any given coverslip, Na+/H+ exchange was measured in several fields, and the determinations were averaged to constitute a single observation. All measurements were made on cells at the same passage on the same day.RESULTSDirect Interaction between the C-terminal Domain of the Human κ Opioid Receptor (hKOR) and NHERF-1/EBP50 —We have previously shown that NHERF-1/EBP50 is associated with the hKOR in CHO cells and overexpression of NHERF-1/EBP50 blocks agonist-induced down-regulation of the hKOR (18Li J.-G. Chen C. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Here we determined whether there was a direct interaction between NHERF-1/EBP50 and C-terminal domain of hKOR by GST fusion protein pull-down techniques. As shown in Fig. 1, GST-hKOR C-tail bound His6-S.tag-NHERF-1/EBP50, but GST did not, indicating that NHERF-1/EBP50 binds directly to the C-terminal domain of the hKOR. In contrast, the C-tails of human μ and δ opioid receptors did not bind NHERF-1/EBP50, demonstrating the selectivity of the interaction of the hKOR C-tail with NHERF-1/EBP50.We next determined whether the C-terminal domain of hKOR was associated with NHERF-1/EBP50 expressed in CHO cells. HA-tagged full-length NHERF-1/EBP50 and its two fragments containing PDZ domains I and II were expressed in CHO cells and Triton X-100-solubilized fractions were used for pull-down experiments. Fig. 2A showed that GST-hKOR C-tail strongly bound NHERF-1/EBP50 and its PDZ domain I-containing fragment but not its domain II-containing fragment, in cell lysates, whereas GST did not bind significantly to any of the constructs. These results indicate that NHERF-1/EBP50 expressed in CHO cells interacts with the C-terminal domain of the hKOR and the PDZ domain I is responsible for the interaction.Fig. 2Association of the hKOR C-tail with NHERF-1/EBP50 expressed in CHO cells or present endogenously in OK cells. A, HA-NHERF-1/EBP50 expressed in CHO cells. CHO cells were transfected with the cDNA construct of HA-NHERF-1/EBP50 (full-length, FL) or the 1–151 fragment containing the PDZ domain I (DI) or the 152–358 fragment containing the PDZ domain II (DII). 2–3 days later, similar numbers of transfected cells were lysed and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged. Pull-down experiments were performed with the supernatants, and glutathione-Sepharose beads pre-bound with GST-hKOR C-tail or GST. Bound proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, blotted onto membranes, and HA-NHERF-1/EBP50 and its PDZ DI and PDZ DII domains were detected by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody against HA (HA.11) (left panel). In the right panel, a fraction of the same batches of transfected cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred, and immunoblotted with the same anti-HA antibody to reveal the expression levels of HA-NHERF-1/EBP50, its DI and DII fragments. B, NHERF-1/EBP50 present endogenously in OK cells. OK cells were lysed and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged. Supernatants were used for pull-down experiments, and NHERF-1/EBP50 was detected by immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-rabbit NHERF-1/EBP50 antibody. The data shown in each panel of this figure are representative of three independent experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Opossum kidney proximal tubule cells (OK cells) have been shown to express NHERF-1/EBP50 (28Lamprecht G.

https://openalex.org/W1997894911,"Platelet activation triggers integrin αIIbβ3-dependent signals and the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein α-actinin. We have previously reported that α-actinin is phosphorylated by the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (Izaguirre, G., Aguirre, L., Hu, Y.-P., Lee, H. Y., Schlaepfer, D. D., Aneskievich, B. J., and Haimovich, B. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 28676-28685). In this study, a phosphatase of 68 kDa that dephosphorylated α-actinin in vitro was isolated from platelet lysates by three sequential chromatography steps. The phosphatase was identified as SHP-1 by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. α-Actinin was dephosphorylated in vitro by recombinant SHP-1 and by SHP-1 immunoprecipitated from unstimulated or thrombin-stimulated platelet lysates. SHP-1 immunoprecipitated from lysates of platelets adherent to fibrinogen, however, failed to dephosphorylate α-actinin. In contrast, the activity of SHP-1 against a synthetic substrate was not affected by the mode of platelet activation. The robust and sustained phosphorylation of α-actinin detected in platelets adherent to fibrinogen thus correlates with a decrease in the activity of SHP-1 toward it. Tyrosine phosphorylation of α-actinin is seen in vanadate-treated COS-7 cells that are co-transfected with α-actinin and wild type FAK. Triple transfection of the cells with cDNAs encoding for α-actinin, FAK, and wild type SHP-1 abolished the phosphorylation of α-actinin. The phosphorylation of FAK, however, was barely affected by the expression of wild type SHP-1. Both α-actinin and FAK were phosphorylated in cells co-expressing α-actinin, FAK, and a catalytic domain mutant (C453S) of SHP-1. These findings establish that SHP-1 can dephosphorylate α-actinin in vitro and in vivo and suggest that SHP-1 may regulate the tethering of receptors to the cytoskeleton and/or the extent of cross-linking of actin filaments in cells such as platelets.

https://openalex.org/W2168647733,"Variola, the causative agent of smallpox, is a highly infectious double-stranded DNA virus of the orthopox genus that replicates within the cytoplasm of infected cells. For unknown reasons prominent skin manifestations, including “pox,” mark the course of this systemic human disease. Here we characterized smallpox growth factor (SPGF), a protein containing an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain that is conserved among orthopox viral genomes, and investigated its possible mechanistic link. We show that after recombinant expression, refolding, and purification, the EGF domain of SPGF binds exclusively to the broadly expressed cellular receptor, erb-B1 (EGF receptor), with subnanomolar affinity, stimulating the growth of primary human keratinocytes and fibroblasts. High affinity monoclonal antibodies specific for SPGF reveal in vivo immunoprotection in a murine vaccinia pneumonia model by a mechanism distinct from viral neutralization. These findings suggest that blockade of pathogenic factor actions, in general, may be advantageous to the infected host.

Before its eradication, smallpox was a devastating disease afflicting humans for greater than 3000 years with significant morbidity and mortality (1Fenner F. Henderson D.A. Arita I. Jezek J. Ladnyi I.D. Small Pox and Its Eradication. World Health Organization, Geneva1988Google Scholar). Variola virus enters through the respiratory tract, and human-human transmission usually occurs via large respiratory droplets. The asymptomatic, non-infectious incubation period averages 10-12 days (range 7-19 days) followed by fever, headache, and backache with a subsequent rash appearing on the face, trunk, and extremities and progressing to vesicles, pustules, and scabs lasting for several weeks. This rather lengthy incubation period provides time for naive, unvaccinated individuals to receive protective immunotherapy. Large scale immunization with vaccinia virus (VV) 1The abbreviations used are: VV, vaccinia virus; EGFR, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor; IMV, intracellular mature virus; IFNγ, interferon γ; mAb, monoclonal antibody; SPGF, smallpox growth factor; VGF, vaccinia growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRPO, horseradish peroxidase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; TGF, transforming growth factor; pfu, plaque-forming units; IL, interleukin; EEV, extracellular enveloped virus; EPI, epiregulin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay; PDB, Protein Data Bank. largely eliminated smallpox in Europe and North America by 1940. Subsequently, in 1967 the World Health Organization launched an intensified worldwide vaccination campaign resulting in eradication of smallpox by 1980 and cessation of vaccination (1Fenner F. Henderson D.A. Arita I. Jezek J. Ladnyi I.D. Small Pox and Its Eradication. World Health Organization, Geneva1988Google Scholar). Given the susceptibility of unvaccinated individuals, the perceived potential for smallpox to be exploited as a mortality-inducing bioweapon is significant. In addition, immunization with VV is considered risky in immunocompromised or immunosuppressed individuals. However, advances in both immunology and genomic analysis may offer new possibilities for eliciting immune protection without the requirement for live-virus vaccination and attendant complications (2Kempe C.H. Pediatrics. 1960; 26: 176-189PubMed Google Scholar). Viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade detection and destruction by the host immune system. One of the evasion strategies that has been adopted by large DNA viruses such as poxviruses and herpesviruses is to encode homologues of cytokines and chemokines and their receptors involved in immune modulation (3Alcami A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 4Seet B.T. Johnston J.B. Brunette C.R. Barrett J.W. Everett H. Cameron C. Spypula J. Nazarian S.H. Lucas A. McFadden G. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 377-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In the present report we employed genome-wide bioinformatic analysis to identify potential immune-accessible targets from variola virus for purposes of immunoprotection. Functional annotation indicated that one candidate protein, D4R, which is conserved among all Orthopoxvirus, corresponds to the variola virus counterpart of the vaccina growth factor precursor (5Twardzik D.R. Brown J.P. Ranchalis J.E. Todaro G.J. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5300-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Vaccinia growth factor (VGF) is an early gene product involved in vaccinia pathogenesis. Host cell proliferative responses to vaccinia virus are mediated by VGF, and not surprisingly, deletion of the VGF factor gene reduces virus virulence in vivo (6Buller R.M. Chakrabarti S. Cooper J.A. Twardzik D.R. Moss B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 866-874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Buller R.M. Chakrabarti S. Moss B. Fredrickson T. Virol. 1988; 164: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Structurally, VGF is a highly glycosylated soluble factor related to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) superfamily, whose signature feature is the presence of an EGF-like domain (5Twardzik D.R. Brown J.P. Ranchalis J.E. Todaro G.J. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5300-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Apella E. Weber I.T. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Signaling by EGF-like ligands is mediated via four cell surface erb-B receptor kinases. Erb-B1, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as well as erb-B2, -B3, and -B4 and their ligands have been studied in detail (for review, see Ref. 9Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5477) Google Scholar). Poxviruses, including vaccinia, exploit the erb-B signaling network via their EGF-like growth factors (10Tzahar E. Moyer J.D. Waterman H. Barbacci E.G. Bao J. Levkowitz G. Shelly M. Strano S. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Pierce J.H. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5948-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, given the connection between viral pathogenesis and the expression of these EGF-like growth factors, we have isolated the smallpox growth factor (SPGF) from variola virus encoded by the D4R gene and expressed and purified the relevant recombinant fragment for functional studies, defining the human cellular target of SPGF. Monoclonal antibodies against this pathogenic factor were produced. Those with sufficiently high affinity and cross-reactive with the structurally related VGF were tested in a murine vaccine pneumonia in vivo model. The results suggest that blockade of viral secreted factors promoting pathogenesis may be advantageous for the infected host in general. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant protein fragments of SPGF (D4R) and VGF (C11R) (residues 40-90) were constructed by PCR and subcloned into the pET15b vector using NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. In the resulting plasmid protein was expressed under the control of the T7 promoter as a fusion with a His6 tag followed by a thrombin cleavage sequence at the N terminus. Protein was induced in Escherichia coli with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A600 of about 0.6 and harvested after 3 h of induction. The inclusion bodies were isolated and dissolved in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 6 m guanidine HCl and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. After oxidation overnight at room temperature, the protein was purified using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. The partially purified protein was diluted to 100 μg/ml with 4 m guanidine HCl and dialyzed extensively at 4 °C against a 50 mm Tris, pH 9, buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm reduced glutathione, and 1 mm oxidized glutathione. After three buffer exchanges over a 72-h period, during which oxidative refolding occurs, the refolded protein was buffer-exchanged to 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 100 mm NaCl. Using a preparative C18 reverse-phase column, more than 90% of the refolded protein separated as a single sharp peak. Electrospray analysis on a mass spectrometer (Qstar Pulsar I) gave mass values of 7907 and 7870 Da for SPGF and VGF, respectively, consistent with their theoretical masses. Chemical Cross-linking of SPGF and erb-B Receptors—2.25 × 106 MB468 or MB453 cells were pretreated with 0.04% NaN3 at 4 °C for 30 min to inhibit receptor internalization. Then biotinylated SPGF at 1 μg/ml was incubated with the cells for 30 min at 4 °C. The dishes were washed with ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Bis(sulfosuccinimdyl) suberate (BS3) cross-linker was added to 1 mm and incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C with occasional shaking. After 2 washes with ice-cold PBS, 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.35 trypsin inhibitor units/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) was added directly to the dishes followed by shaking at 4 °C for 30 min. Samples were spun down, and the supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 1 μg of anti-erb-B1, anti-erb-B3, or anti-erb-B4 (Santa Cruz) goat polyclonal antibodies or a 1:40 dilution of anti-erb-B2 (Cell Signaling) rabbit polyclonal antibody using 10 μl of GammaBind™ plus beads. After rotating at 4 °C for 5 h, the beads were washed 4 times with 1 × Tris-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100 followed by boiling the beads directly in 2× SDS loading buffer. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting by streptavidin-HRPO were used to reveal the biotinylated erb-B receptors. For analysis of erb-B receptor subtype-specific expression in MB468 and MB453 cells, lysates as above were immunoprecipitated with the anti-erbB antisera and then Western-blotted with the same antibodies used for immunoprecipitation in the case of erb-B1 and erb-B3 and goat anti-erb-B2 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) and rabbit anti-erb-B4 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) for erb-B2 and erb-B4, respectively. All membrane treatments are as described subsequently for Western-blotting analysis under “Experimental Procedures” except an anti-rabbit IgG HRPO conjugate was employed for erb-B4 detection. Monoclonal Antibody Production and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) Screening—To generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) using recombinant SPGF protein, 8-week-old BALB/c mice were immunized (intraperitoneally) with 50 μg of SPGF 4-5 times at 2-week intervals. The first immunization was done in Freund's complete adjuvant followed by incomplete Freund's adjuvant for subsequent immunization. Mice were sacrificed 5 days after the final boost, and the cells from splenocytes were fused with NS-1 myeloma cells using a standard fusion protocol (11Kohler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12509) Google Scholar). Hybridomas were screened by ELISA. Antibody-secreting hybridomas were cloned twice by limiting dilution before being inoculated into pristane-primed mice for production of ascitic fluid. mAbs were purified using a protein G column. The three mAbs used in this study, 2-22, 11D7, and 13E8, are all of the IgG2b isotype. ELISA was performed in 96-well plates to which Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid had been coated (Ni-NTA HisSorb, Qiagen). 50 μl of SPGF at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 were plated on nickel plates for5hat4 °C followed by washing three times with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20. 50 μl of each hybridoma supernatant were added per well and incubated overnight at 4 °C with shaking. After washing 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20, 50 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L)-horse-radish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) were added for 90 min (1:2000 dilution) in 1% BSA and PBS buffer at 4 °C. Plates were washed twice with 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS buffer and twice with PBS alone and developed with ortho-phenylene diamine as a substrate. The reaction was stopped after 7 min with 2.25 m H2SO4. The optical density at 490 nm was measured. Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Analyses—All experiments were performed on a BIAcore 3000 instrument (Biacore, Piscataway, NJ) at 25 °C in Hepes-buffered saline running buffer (150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P-20, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). To test the antigenic reactivity of 2-22, 11D7, and 13E8 antibody to SPGF and VGF, each antibody was coupled to the CM5 chip surface using an amine coupling kit at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Then SPGF and VGF at a concentration of 8 μg/ml were individually passed over each immobilized antibody surface. The sensor surface was regenerated between binding reactions by 2 washes of 10 mm glycine buffer, pH 9.5, for 15 s at 100 μl/min. For determination of the kinetics of antigen-antibody binding, 2-22 and 13E8 mAbs were individually immobilized on the CM5 chip surface using a standard amine coupling procedure. For each antibody, all experiments were performed on three surfaces of different ligand densities ranging from 1000 to 1500 response units. Association was measured by passing various concentrations of SPGF or VGF (1-10 nm) over each ligand surface for 2 min at a flow rate of 50-100 μl/min. The sensor surface was regenerated between binding reactions by two washes of 10 mm glycine buffer, pH 9.5, for 15 s at 100 μl/min. Identical injections over blank surfaces were subtracted from the data to determine specific binding. Binding kinetics were evaluated in a 1:1 binding model (12Kim M. Chen B. Hussey R.E. Chishti Y.

Human Keratinocyte and Fibroblast Mitogen Assays—The normal primary human dermal fibroblast line R2F (13Tubo R.A. Rheinwald J.G. Oncogene Res. 1987; 1: 407-421PubMed Google Scholar) was cultured in Complete fibroblast medium, consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% calf serum (Hyclone, Inc.) and 10 ng/ml EGF. The normal primary human epidermal keratinocyte line N (14Schön M. Rheinwald J.G. J. Investig.

Biol. 2002; 22: 5157-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) in Complete keratinocyte medium consisting of Invitrogen keratinocyte serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 30 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 0.2 ng/ml EGF, and 0.3 mm CaCl2. Mitogenicity assays were performed by plating R2F and N cells at low density in reduced serum and reduced bovine pituitary extract versions of their respective media formulations and without EGF such that their proliferation in response to a range of concentrations of added mitogen could be assessed. 3000 R2F cells were plated in replicate 9-cm2 wells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 plus 1% calf serum. The next day and also the fourth day after plating, the wells were refed with this medium supplemented with a range of EGF and SPGF concentrations or with complete fibroblast medium. 1000 N cells were plated in replicate 9-cm2 wells in Invitrogen keratinocyte serum-free medium plus 15 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract plus 0.3 mm CaCl2. The next day and also the fourth day after plating, the wells were refed with this medium supplemented with a range of EGF and SPGF concentrations or with complete keratinocyte medium. The well cultures were trypsinized and counted 6 days after plating. The proliferation rate was measured as population doublings per day: log2 (number of cells after 6 days/number of cells plated)/6. SPGF Biotinylation and Binding to Epithelial Cells Analyzed by FACS—SPGF was biotinylated using the ECL protein biotinylation module (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 1 × 105 MB468 cells (or MB453 cells) were used for each sample. For direct binding assay (Fig. 2D), 1 aliquot of cells was incubated with 1 μg of anti-EGFR blocking antibody (528, Santa Cruz) at 4 °C for 1 h. Different concentrations of biotinylated SPGF in 50 μl of FACS buffer (1× PBS, 2.5% FCS, 0.02% NaN3) were added to the various cells and further incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. For competition assays (Fig. 2A), cells were incubated with 50 μl of FACS buffer containing different amounts of unlabeled SPGF, epiregulin, and EGF at 4 °C for 20 min, then 25 ng of biotinylated SPGF was added to each tube with further incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed in FACS buffer, and biotinylated SPGF was visualized by streptavidin-phycoerythin (Molecular Probes) using FACS, recording the mean florescence intensity (MFI). Inhibition was plotted as percentage expressed as (MFI - MFIneg)/(MFImax - MFIneg). Cell Lysate Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—HeLa cells (80-90% confluent) in 10-cm culture dishes were stimulated with 50 ng/ml ligands at 37 °C for 10 min. The dish was washed once with ice-cold PBS. Cells were directly lysed by 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.35 trypsin inhibitor units/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm Na3VO4) at 4 °C for 30 min. After spinning the samples, 0.5 ml of lysate was immunoprecipitated by 1 μg of anti-EGFR (goat polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 10 μl of GammaBind plus beads at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed 3 times and eluted directly in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The total cell lysates and immunoprecipitated samples were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane was blocked in 2.5% BSA, Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST) (for EGFR) or 2% gelatin, TBST (for 4G10) at 37 °C for at least 30 min. Primary antibody was incubated with membranes overnight at 4 °C according to the manufacture's recommendation. Membranes were washed and incubated with 1:10,000 anti-goat IgG (for EGFR) or anti-mouse IgG2b (for 4G10) HRPO conjugates at room temperature for 1 h. After extensive washing, the membranes were developed using a chemiluminescence reagent kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Affinity of SPGF Binding to EGFR—A lactoperoxidase-catalyzed method was used for labeling SPGF, whereas a chloramine T-catalyzed method was used for EGF. The specific activity of labeled SPGF was 0.54 pmol/cpm, whereas EGF had 0.34 pmol/cpm. MB468 cells were plated at 3 × 104/0.1 ml/96 wells. 125I-Labeled SPGF or EGF was added at different concentrations in 50 μl of binding medium (L15 medium with 0.1% NaN3) at 4 °C and incubated for 5 h. Supernatants were harvested, and the cells were quickly washed twice with 60 μl of ice-cold binding medium. The supernatant and the washes were then combined. 50 μl of 0.5 n NaOH was added into each well at room temperature for 1 h to lyse the remaining material and further washed once with 60 μl of 0.5 n NaOH. γ-Counting was used to determine the free ligand in the culture supernatant as well as the bound ligand in cell lysates. The affinity, receptor number, and Scatchard plot were calculated. Antibody Blocking Assay—1 μg of anti-EGFR blocking antibody was added to HeLa cells at 37 °C for 30 min, whereas different amounts of antibody 2-22 were premixed with 1 ng of SPGF or EGF at room temperature for 30 min. 1 ng of SPGF or EGF with or without EGFR or premixed 2-22/SPGF or 2-22/EGF was added to 2 × 105/ml HeLa cells in 24-well plates at 37 °C for 10 min. After washing twice with ice-cold PBS, HeLa cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. Molecular Graphics and Modeling—The molecular model of the D4R (residues 40-90) was derived by homology modeling from the three-dimensional coordinates of mouse EGF (PDB code 1EGF) using the package MODELLER (16Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar). Ribbon representations of the structures were generated using MOLSCRIPT (17Kraulis P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 924-950Crossref Google Scholar) followed by image rendering with RASTER3D (18Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar). The molecular surface of the D4R model was generated using GRASP (19Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5311) Google Scholar). Colored residues in the D4R surface are the equivalent to those in TGF-α, which were found to interact with the L1 (yellow), L2 (red), or both L1/L2 domains (green) of the erb-B1 receptor in the three-dimensional structure of TGF-α in complex with erb-B1 (Fig. 3). Sequence alignment was made using ClustalW (20Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 2: 4673-4680Crossref Scopus (54908) Google Scholar) and structural alignment was guided by the structure superimposition program TOP (21Lu G. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 176-183Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar) (bioinfo1.mbfys.1u.se/TOP). Mapping of accessibility D4R onto the structural alignment was carried out using the program ESPript (22Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Metoz F. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). Cells and Viruses—Vaccinia virus strain WR was propagated in L929 cells, whereas viral titer assays were performed in Vero cells as previously described (23Selin L.K. Nahill S.R. Welsh R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 24Selin L.K. Varga S.M. Wong I.C. Welsh R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1705-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Unpurified vaccinia virus from tissue culture supernatants was used for all animal infections. Vaccinia Virus Infections—Male, 6-8-week-old C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were injected intraperitoneally with antibody preparations (200 μg of each antibody) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline except for 2× dosing where 400 μg was used. Six hours later, mice were anesthetized by inhalation of metofane (Pitman-Moore) and were infected intranasally with 1 × 104 pfu of vaccinia virus diluted in 50 μl of medium. Lung Histological Virus Titration—At the times indicated, one lung from each infected animal was harvested, homogenized in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, separated in aliquots, and frozen at -80 °C. The number of pfu/ml in each lung was determined by plaque assay using 10% of the homogenate as previously described (24Selin L.K. Varga S.M. Wong I.C. Welsh R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1705-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The contralateral lung from each VV-infected mouse was collected, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde, and then paraffin-embedded. Tissue sections (5 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and analyzed microscopically under 10× magnification. Analysis of Adaptive T Cell Response—Single cell suspensions were prepared from spleens, and erythrocytes were removed by lysis using a 0.84% NH4Cl solution. VV-specific CD8+ T cells were detected by measuring IFN-γ secretion to VV-infected fibroblasts (MC57G) using the Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit Plus™ (with GolgiPlug™, Pharmingen). Briefly, MC57G cells were incubated for 2 h with a 5 × 106 pfu of WR strain of VV (multiplicity of infection 1.2). Subsequently, 1-2 × 106 splenocytes were incubated in 96-well plates with 2.5 × 105 VV-infected or uninfected MC57G cells in the presence of 10 units/ml human recombinant IL-2 (Pharmingen) and 0.2 μl of GolgiPlug™ for 5 h at 37 °C. After preincubation with 1 μl of Fc Block™ (2.4G2) in 96-well plates containing 100 μl of FACS buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, 2% FCS, 0.1% NaN3), cells were stained (20 min, 4 °C) with combinations of fluorochrome-labeled mAbs specific for CD8α (53-6.7), CD44 (IM7). Subsequent fixation and permeabilization of the cells was performed to allow intracellular access to the anti-IFNγ mAb (XMG1.2; Pharmingen). Freshly stained samples were analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur and CellQuest Software (San Diego, CA). Anti-CD3 stimulation was used to detect recently activated CD8+ T cells. Splenocytes were incubated with 5 μg/ml purified anti-mouse CD3ϵ Ab (145-2C11) under the same conditions described above. Effects of SPGF and Anti-SPGF mAbs on Variola Strain Solaimen Plaque Formation in Vitro—Confluent BSC40 monolayers in two T-162 flasks were infected with variola strain Solaimen at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. Cells were incubated at 36 °C, 6% CO2 for 1 h, rocked at 15-min intervals, and overlaid with RPMI supplemented with 2% FBS (RPMI-2%; 35 ml total volume/flask). The virally infected cells were incubated at 36 °C, 6% CO2 for 72 h. Harvesting of extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) particles was done by pooling the supernatant of the viral infections into a 250-ml centrifuge bottle. Cell monolayers, containing mostly cell associated virus and IMV, were then rinsed with media, scraped into media suspension, pooled into two 50-ml conical tubes, and frozen at -20 °C to be used for future studies. We estimated that an EEV titer of ∼1.5 × 104 pfu/ml was obtained in the viral infection, and we used this figure to dilute the EEV in RPMI-2% such that we would have 50 pfu/well in the experiment. The diluted EEV was then split into two 50-ml conical tubes. IMV-neutralizing antibody, J2D5 (1:1000), was added to one tube containing diluted EEV particles to neutralize any IMV particles. Diluted virus with or without J2D5 was separated into aliquots and deposited into the 2-ml wells of a 96-well dilution plate. Monoclonal antibodies raised against SPGF (2-22, 2-13, 13E8, and 11D7) were added to each corresponding well at a final concentration of 100 μg. The virus was incubated with or without mAbs at 4 °C for 30 min and subsequently plated onto confluent BSC40 monolayers in 6-well plates. Each mAb was tested in triplicate with or without J2D5. Additionally, we tested the effect of pre-treating the cell monolayer with α-EGFR 528 mAb. Three wells of a 6-well plate were pretreated by adding anti-EGFR mAb (1:1000), whereas the remaining wells were mock-treated with RPMI-2%. The pretreated plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min before adding diluted virus with or without J2D5. All plates were then incubated at 36 °C, 6% CO2 for 1 h and rocked at 15-min intervals. The inoculum was removed, and 2 ml of RPMI-2% (with or without J2D5) was added to each well. The plates were incubated at 36 °C, 6% CO2 for 3.5 days at which time they were stained with 2× crystal violet, and viral plaques were counted. The results in Supplemental Fig. S1 show that mAbs raised against SPGF marginally inhibit viral plaque formation by a population of virus that is predominantly EEV. Because the SPGF is thought to derive from the EEV membrane and EEV particles are the numerically minor fraction of viruses in the population, this experiment shows that anti-SPGF mAbs are not neutralizing mAbs. To determine whether recombinant SPGF can block variola virus entry into non-transformed human cells, a second type of experiment was performed. Confluent human foreskin fibroblast monolayers in 6-well plates were pretreated with 1 ml of RPMI-2% with and without recombinant SPGF at a concentration of 50 nm 60 min before infection. Cells were then infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5 in 1 ml of total volume with variola strain Solaimen in RPMI-2% with or without 50 nm SPGF. Three wells of each plate were pretreated and infected in the presence of SPGF, and the remaining three wells were mock-treated. The plates were incubated at 36 °C, 6% CO2 for 1 h and rocked gently at 15-min intervals to ensure even infection and coverage of the cell monolayer. The inoculum was removed, and 2 ml of RPMI-2% with or without SPGF was added to the appropriate wells. The virally infected cells were incubated at 36 °C, 6% CO2 and harvested at various times post-infection. An initial time point was harvested when the viral inoculum was removed. Harvesting of time points was done by scraping the cell monolayer from the wells and fully resuspending the viral-infected cells followed by two freeze-thaw cycles. A 100-μl aliquot of each time point was serially diluted in RPMI-2%. Dilutions 10-3-10-8 were plated on BSC40 confluent monolayers in 6-well plates. Plates were incubated at 36 °C, 6% CO2 for 1 h and rocked gently at 15-min intervals. The inoculum was removed from each well and 2 ml of RPMI-2% was added. The p"

Brief treatment of the cells with 100 nm angiotensin II or 1 μm serotonin resulted in serine phosphorylation of Rb that was equal in magnitude to that induced by treating cells for 20 h with 10% fetal bovine serum (≈3 × basal). There was no detectable rapid phosphorylation of two close cousins of Rb, p107 and p130. Phosphorylation state-specific antisera demonstrated that the rapid phosphorylation occurred on Ser795, but not on Ser249, Thr252, Thr373, Ser780, Ser807, or Ser811. Phosphorylation of Rb Ser795 peaked at 10 min, lagging behind phosphorylation of MEK and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase). Rb Ser795 phosphorylation could be blocked by PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, and greatly attenuated by apigenin, an inhibitor of the Ras → Raf → MEK → ERK pathway. The effect also appears to be mediated by CDK4. Immunoprecipitation/immunoblot studies revealed that serotonin and angiotensin II induced complex formation between CDK4, cyclin D1, and phosphorylated ERK. These studies show a rapid, novel, and selective phosphorylation of Rb Ser795 by mitogens and demonstrate an unexpected rapid linkage between the actions of the Ras → Raf → MEK → ERK pathway and the phosphorylation state of Rb.

The links between pathways that translate extracellular signals into proliferative responses in cells are very complex. In particular, the relationships between signals that activate transcription cascades and those that release tonic inhibitions on cell cycle progression are only now being elucidated. The major players in proliferative transcription cascades are various types of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Ang II, angiotensin II; CDK, cyclin-dependent protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin; MEK, mitogen- and extracellular signal-regulated kinases kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3′-kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma gene product; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; FBS, fetal bovine serum.

Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar), whereas the gene product encoded by Rb holds the cell cycle in check (3Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Google Scholar, 4Cobrinik D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 208: 31-61Google Scholar). Phosphorylation cascades regulate the activities of the MAPKs and Rb, stimulating the former and inhibiting the latter (1Van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Google Scholar, 2Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar, 3Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Google Scholar, 4Cobrinik D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 208: 31-61Google Scholar, 5Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Devel. 1998; 8: 21-27Google Scholar). Although the pathways regulating the MAPKs have been reasonably well mapped out, those that regulate the cell cycle still require elucidation. What is known is that: 1) in its active hypophosphorylated state, Rb suppresses cell cycle progression at the G0-G1 interface; 2) when hyperphosphorylated, Rb becomes less active and is unable to hold the cell cycle in check; 3) Rb is a substrate for phosphorylation by several cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs); and 4) dephosphorylation of Rb is mediated by protein phosphatase 1 (5Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Devel. 1998; 8: 21-27Google Scholar). Rb contains 16 Ser/Thr-Pro sequences that are potential CDK phosphorylation sites, and most of those sequences have been demonstrated to represent bona fide in vitro phosphorylation sites (5Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Devel. 1998; 8: 21-27Google Scholar, 6Lees J.A. Buchkovic K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation of Rb has three known effects: 1) it releases Rb from nuclear tethers, 2) it causes decreased mobility on SDS-PAGE analysis, and 3) it disrupts the binding of Rb to three distinct classes of proteins (3Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Google Scholar, 4Cobrinik D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 208: 31-61Google Scholar, 5Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Devel. 1998; 8: 21-27Google Scholar). Those are the oncogenic c-Abl (Abelson) kinase (7Welch P.J. Yang J.Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 31-46Google Scholar), cellular proteins that contain the LXCXE sequence (8Hu Q.J. Dyson N. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1147-1155Google Scholar, 9Huang S. Wang N.P. Tseng B.Y. Lee W.H. Lee E.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1815-1822Google Scholar), and the E2F family of transcription factors (10Wang J.Y. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Google Scholar). Thr821 and Thr826 of Rb appear to be involved in the regulation of LXCXE binding, and Ser807 and Ser811 appear to be involved in c-Abl binding (11Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8313-8320Google Scholar, 12Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Google Scholar, 13Zarkowska T. Mittnacht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12738-12746Google Scholar). Those sites do not appear to be involved in the regulation of E2F binding (11Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8313-8320Google Scholar, 12Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Google Scholar, 13Zarkowska T. Mittnacht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12738-12746Google Scholar). In contrast, Ser795 appears to be intimately involved in the binding of E2F. Phosphorylation of this site by cyclin D1/CDK4 also has functional significance in that mutation of Ser795 to Ala prevents phosphorylation and inactivation of the cell cycle arrest function of Rb (14Connell-Crowley L. Harper J.W. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 297-301Google Scholar). The region surrounding Ser795 is important in E2F binding, but mutation of Ser795 alone is insufficient to abolish E2F binding (12Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Google Scholar). Although there is not universal agreement on which Rb sites are substrates for the different CDKs, recent evidence supports specificity in the interactions of various CDKs with Rb (12Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Google Scholar, 13Zarkowska T. Mittnacht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12738-12746Google Scholar, 14Connell-Crowley L. Harper J.W. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 297-301Google Scholar, 15Kitagawa M.H. Higashi H. Jung H.K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Google Scholar). The situation is further complicated by the existence of other E2F-binding proteins (p107 and p130) that may serve overlapping functions with Rb. Thus, there is opportunity for highly specific interactions among the various kinases and phosphorylation sites on Rb or p107 and p130. The molecular mechanisms that couple the cell cycle machinery to mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways have been the focus of studies by different groups over the past few years. It has been suggested that the ERK pathway acts primarily to positively regulate the cell cycle during G1 at the level of cyclin D synthesis, assembly of cyclin D-dependent kinase complexes, and subsequent phosphorylation of Rb (16Wilkinson M.G. Millar J.B.A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2147-2157Google Scholar). In the current study, we investigated the effects of two prototypical mitogenic agonists, angiotensin II (Ang II) (17Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Google Scholar) and serotonin (5-HT) (18Lee S.L. Wang W.W. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C223-C230Google Scholar), on the phosphorylation state of Rb in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Ang II is thought to mediate the excessive vascular proliferation and restenosis that occurs after angioplasty (19Powell J.S. Clozel J.P. Muller K.M. Kuhn H. Hefti F. Hosang M. Baumgartner H.R. Science. 1989; 245: 186-188Google Scholar, 20Kaufman R.F. Bean J.S. Zimmerman K.M. Brown R.F. Steinberg M.I. Life Sci. 1991; 49: PL223-PL229Google Scholar). 5-HT is also thought to mediate excessive vascular tone in atherosclerosis (21Golino P. Piscione F. Benedict C.R. Anderson H.V. Cappelli-Bigazzi M. Indolfi C. Condorelli M. Chiarello M. Willerson J.T. New Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 130-131Google Scholar, 22Willerson J.T. Eidt J. McNatt J. Yao S. Golino P. Anderson H. Buja L.M. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1991; 17: 101B-110BGoogle Scholar). Thus, both hormones are relevant subjects for the study of regulation of Rb by cell surface receptors. The hypothesis that we tested is that cell surface receptors that activate ERK MAPKs in VSMC would also induce phosphorylation of Rb. We further hypothesized that Ser795 would provide a logical target for the action of the ERKs in that 1) it is involved in the suppression of E2F transcription factors, and 2) the Ras → Raf → MEK → ERK pathway exerts its major effects by regulating transcription cascades. Materials—Drugs and reagents were obtained from the following sources. Angiotensin II, 5-HT, epidermal growth factor, and phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate, and agarose-conjugated anti-phosphoserine antibodies were from Sigma. PD98059 and apigenin were from Calbiochem. Rapamycin and wortmannin were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Cell culture media, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and antibiotics were obtained from Invitrogen and culture flasks from Costar (Cambridge, MA). The phospho-ERK, phospho-Rb, phospho-MEK, phospho-p70 S6 kinase, and phospho-Akt antibody kits and anti-Rb (C- and N-terminal) antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-p107, anti-p130, anti-Rb, anti-E2F-1, and anti-CDK6 antibodies and anti-CDK2- and anti-CDK4-agarose-conjugated antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-CDK4, anti-cyclin D1 antibodies, and protein A-agarose were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Cell Culture—Rat aortic VSMC were obtained and maintained as previously described (23Ullian M.E. Raymond J.R. Paul R.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1241-C1249Google Scholar). Cells were used at passages 4-7. Treatment of the animal subjects conformed to guidelines of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Phosphoprotein Immunoblots—For most experiments, protein phosphorylation (of ERK, Rb, MEK, Akt, and p70 S6 kinase) was assessed using phosphorylation state-specific antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). The protocol was identical to that previously described by us (24Garnovskaya M.N. van Biesen T. Hawes B. Casanas Ramos S. Lefkowitz R.J. Raymond J.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13716-13722Google Scholar, 25Mukhin Y.V. Garnovsky E.A. Ullian M.E. Garnovskaya M.N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 968-977Google Scholar), except that the dilutions of the various antibodies followed the manufacturer's recommendations and the blots were developed using Vistra ECF reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Quiescent VSMC cells grown in 100-mm dishes were treated with vehicle, 1 μm 5-HT, or 100 nm Ang II for 10 min and lysed in 500 μl/dish of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.5% w/v sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm NaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Precleared by incubation with protein A-agarose bead slurry, cell lysates (1 μg/μl total cell protein) were incubated overnight with mouse monoclonal anti-phosphoserine IgG conjugated to agarose beads, rabbit polyclonal anti-CDK4 IgG, mouse monoclonal anti-cyclin D1 antibody, or rabbit polyclonal anti-Rb IgG. Immunoprecipitates were captured by addition of protein A-agarose. The agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed twice in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblot analysis. The same Western blots were stripped and reprobed with the antibody used for immunoprecipitation to assure that equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane. Cyclin-dependent Kinase Assays—Cells were treated with vehicle, 1 μm 5-HT, or 100 nm Ang II for 5 min, and then protein extracts were prepared as described (26Sun J. Qian Y. Chen Z. Marfurt J. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6930-6934Google Scholar). For each condition, 5 × 106 cells were scraped into lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 25 μg/ml of leupeptin, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were vortexed, placed on ice for 10 min, and then the lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Aliquots of the lysates were incubated with rabbit antibodies raised against CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The CDK2 and CDK4 antibodies were precoupled with protein A-agarose. Immune complexes were isolated by centrifugation directly or, for CDK6, after incubation with protein A-agarose. The immune complexes were resuspended in 10 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μCi of [γ-32P[ATP, and 20 μg/ml of recombinant protein fusion between maltose-binding protein and Rb residues 701-928 (Cell Signaling Technology). The mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in a shaking water bath, and then the reactions were terminated by the addition of equal volumes of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were separated on precast 4-20% SDS-PAGE gels (Novex, La Jolla, CA) and visualized on a Phosphorimager (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed for repeated measures by Student's t test for unpaired two-tailed analysis. p values <0.05 were considered significant. To study phosphorylation of Rb by mitogens in VSMC, we used phosphorylation state-specific antibodies that have been recently developed and extensively characterized. Their specificity has been validated using mutant recombinant Rb proteins (27Boylan J.F. Sharp D.M. Leffet L. Bowers A. Pan W. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 110-114Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 5-HT (1 μm) for 10 min, 10% FBS for 20 h (positive control), or vehicle and then subjected to immunoblot. Fig. 1A shows that 5-HT induced a marked increase in the level of phospho-Rb-Ser795 that was equal in magnitude to that induced by FBS. 5-HT did not increase the levels of phospho-Rb-Ser807/811, phospho-Rb-Ser780, phospho-Rb-Thr373, or phospho-Rb-Ser249/Thr252, all of which have been suggested to be bona fide and functionally significant Rb phosphorylation sites (11Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8313-8320Google Scholar, 12Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Google Scholar, 13Zarkowska T. Mittnacht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12738-12746Google Scholar, 14Connell-Crowley L. Harper J.W. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 297-301Google Scholar, 27Boylan J.F. Sharp D.M. Leffet L. Bowers A. Pan W. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 110-114Google Scholar). In contrast, FBS increased the level of phosphorylation of Ser249/Thr252, Thr373, Ser780, and Ser807/811. To establish that brief treatment of VSMC with mitogens could alter the phosphoserine content of Rb, VSMC were treated with 5-HT or Ang II. After lysis, VSMC extracts were incubated with agarose-conjugated anti-phosphoserine antibody, precipitated, and subjected to immunoblot with antisera specific for Rb, p107, and p130. Fig. 1B shows that treatments for 10 min with Ang II (100 nm) and 5-HT (1 μm) increased the phosphoserine content of Rb in VSMC to nearly three times the basal levels. The magnitude of the phosphorylation was similar to that induced by 10% FBS (20 h, Fig. 1B) and epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml × 10 min, not shown). The increases were apparent whether C-terminal Rb or N-terminal Rb antisera were used. In contrast, treatment with Ang II and 5-HT did not alter the phosphoserine content of p107, whereas pre-treatment with FBS for 20 h markedly increased p107 phosphoserine content (not shown). We did not detect p130 in immunoprecipitates from VSMC. These data suggested that 5-HT and Ang II can rapidly induce serine phosphorylation of Rb, but not p107 or p130, in VSMC. We next used the Ser795 phospho-specific antibody to confirm that both Ang II and 5-HT rapidly induce phosphorylation of Rb on serine 795. Fig. 1C shows that both 5-HT and Ang II increased the phosphorylation of Rb on Ser795 after 10 min of incubation. The increases in phosphorylation were similar in magnitude to those induced by treatment with 10% FBS (20 h, Fig. 1B) and 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate or epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml × 10 min, not shown). Because Rb phosphorylation has previously been linked to the Ras → Raf → MEK → ERK pathway, we performed experiments to test the role of that pathway in phosphorylation of Rb Ser795. Fig. 2A shows that both Ang II and 5-HT stimulate phosphorylation of MEK (6 and 5 × basal levels, respectively) and ERK (to 5 × basal levels for both), as has been previously shown by others (28Ushio-Fukai M. Zafari A.M Fukui T. Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23317-23321Google Scholar, 29Florian J.A. Watts S.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 346-355Google Scholar). The time courses for MEK and ERK phosphorylation by each hormone were similar, peaking at 5 min and persisting for at least 60 min. The peak phosphorylation of Rb lagged slightly behind MEK and ERK (peaking at 10 min), consistent with a potential role for MEK and ERK upstream of Rb (Fig. 2B). We next examined the ability of two inhibitors of the Ras → Raf → MEK → ERK pathway to prevent phosphorylation of MEK, ERK, and Rb. Phosphorylation of both ERK and Rb was greatly attenuated by preincubation with the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, (10 μm) (30Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.I. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Google Scholar) for 15 min prior to stimulation with 5-HT or Ang II. Fig. 3 shows that phosphorylation of ERK and Rb was also blocked significantly by apigenin (50 μm). At this concentration, apigenin has been shown to arrest synchronized human diploid fibroblasts at the G0-G1 interface (31Lepley D.M. Pelling J.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 19: 74-82Google Scholar) and to block Ras-mediated activation of ERK (32Kuo M.L. Lin J.K. Huang T.S. Yang N.C. Cancer Lett. 1994; 87: 91-97Google Scholar, 33Kuo M.L. Yang N.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 212: 91767-91775Google Scholar). In contrast, apigenin and PD98059 did not significantly affect the phosphorylation of MEK. Thus, these results confirm that both apigenin and PD98059 interfered with phosphorylation of ERK and Rb Ser795 without significantly affecting the phosphorylation of MEK. Thus, both compounds appear to block MEK function, resulting in inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK and Rb. Because there is also evidence that a second pathway involving phosphatidylinositol-3′-kinase (PI3K) and p70 S6 kinase can regulate the cell cycle by modulating Rb function, we tested the effects of inhibitors of those two targets on Ang II- and 5-HT-induced phosphorylation of Rb Ser795. Those experiments showed no effect of wortmannin or rapamycin on Ang II- and 5-HT-induced phosphorylation of Rb Ser795 (Fig. 3). At the same time, treatment cells with wortmannin completely inhibited 5-HT- or Ang II-induced phosphorylation of Akt, the major known effector of PI3K (data not shown), supporting the inhibition of PI3K in our conditions. Similarly, rapamycin treatment blocked epidermal growth factor or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (data not shown), indicating that p70 S6 kinase was indeed inhibited under our experimental conditions. Those experiments establish a clear link between MEK (and not PI3K or p70 S6 kinase) and the phosphorylation of Rb Ser795. Multiple proline-directed kinases have been demonstrated to phosphorylate Rb, including CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, and ERK (13Zarkowska T. Mittnacht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12738-12746Google Scholar, 34Taya Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 14017Google Scholar, 35Taieb F. Karaiskou A. Rime H. Jessus C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 465-471Google Scholar). To further assess the biochemical consequences of brief 5-HT and Ang II treatments on vascular smooth muscle cells, the ability of those agents to activate possible intermediate kinases was assessed using an immunoprecipitation kinase assay in which a C-terminal Rb fusion protein (which includes Ser795) was used as the substrate. These studies showed that both hormones stimulated the ability of CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 (≈1.7-2.4-fold) to phosphorylate Rb. ERK1/2 immunoprecipitates did not increase phosphorylation of the Rb fusion protein (not shown). Thus, ERK is not directly involved in the phosphorylation of Rb induced by brief treatments with Ang II or 5-HT. Preincubation of the cells with PD98059 had no effect on the ability of either Ang II or 5-HT to activate CDK2 or CDK6. In contrast, PD98059 significantly attenuated the phosphorylation of Rb induced by stimulation of CDK4 by both 5-HT and Ang II (Fig. 4). This would suggest that CDK4 (and not CDK2 or CDK6) is involved in the phosphorylation of Rb Ser795 induced by Ang II and 5-HT in VSMC. We next examined whether 5-HT and Ang II could induce a physical interaction between cyclin D1/CDK4 and ERK1/2. We explored this possibility using immunoprecipitation of lysates from cells pretreated with vehicle or PD98059 for 30 min and then treated with vehicle, 5-HT, or Ang II with a polyclonal CDK4 antibody, followed by Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies to cyclin D1 and to ERK1/2. Exposure of VSMC to 5-HT or Ang II for 10 min increased the amount of cyclin D1 in CDK4 immunoprecipitates by ∼250% (Fig. 5A). Pretreatment of VSMC with PD98059 completely abolished the increase of cyclin D1 in CDK4 immunoprecipitates induced by 5-HT and Ang II, supporting an important role of MEK-ERK activity for formation of a complex between CDK4 and cyclin D1. Interestingly, active (phosphorylated) ERK1/2 appears to form a complex with CDK4/cyclin D1, and the amount of phospho-ERK in CDK4 immunoprecipitates was increased by ∼300% in VSMC stimulated with 5-HT or Ang II for 10 min. There was no detectable amount of phospho-ERK in CDK4 immunoprecipitates from cells pretreated with PD98059 (Fig. 5B). Because Rb function depends, at least in part, on interactions with the E2F family of DNA-binding transcription factors, we wanted to explore the possibility that 5-HT and Ang II stimulate a dissociation of E2F from Rb. To answer this question we pretreated VSMC with vehicle or PD98059 for 30 min, treated them with vehicle, 5-HT, or Ang II, and performed immunoprecipitation of Rb from cell lysates with a polyclonal Rb antibody followed by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody to the E2F-1 transcription regulator. Treatment of VSMC for 10 min with 1 μm of 5-HT or 100 nm of Ang II resulted in a ∼30% decrease in the amount of E2F-1 in Rb immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6). Interestingly, pretreatment of VSMC with PD98059 caused a slight but significant ∼20% increase in the amount of E2F-1 in Rb immunoprecipitates from cell lysates that did not depend on 5-HT or Ang II treatment. The specific role of the Ras → Raf → MEK → ERK pathway in the regulation of the cell cycle is still controversial. Evidence from at least five studies supports a direct role for certain components of this pathway in the stimulation of the cell cycle, and this regulation usually takes place over a period of several or more hours. First, the cyclin D1 promoter and protein were shown to be increased by ERK activation in CCL39 cells; these effects occurred within 6-9 hours. Serum stimulation or transfection with constitutively activated ERK or the ERK phosphatase MKP-1 was sufficient to induce hyperphosphorylation of Rb, whereas transfection with an inducible version of constitutively activated Raf was not (34Taya Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 14017Google Scholar, 36Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Müller R. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Google Scholar). Moreover, some mitogens have previously been reported to cause hyperphosphorylation of Rb (serum, thrombin), whereas others have not (epidermal growth factor, insulin). Sustained ERK activation has also been shown to positively regulate cyclin D1 expression in IIC9 fibroblasts (37Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Google Scholar), and MEK1 has been shown to play a significant role in the synthesis of cyclin D1 in NIH 3T3 cells (38Ladha M.H. Kwang Y.L. Upton T.M. Reed M.F. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6605-6615Google Scholar). In addition, it has been proposed that MEK/ERK pathway not only induces the cyclin D1 gene but also functions post-translationally to regulate cyclin D1 assembly with CDK4 (39Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1091-1096Google Scholar). Second, another group showed that expression of p16INK4, an inhibitor of CDK4, blocked transformation of rat embryonic fibroblasts induced by Ha-Ras (40Serrano M. Gomez-Lahoz E. DePinho R.A. Beach D. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1995; 267: 249-252Google Scholar). Third, Ang II was shown to induce cyclin D1 expression in the H295R human adrenal cell line, and this regulation involved Ras and ERK. Rb phosphorylation was also induced, but this occurred at 12 hours (41Watanabe G. Lee R.J. Albanese C. Rainey W. Batlle D. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22570-22577Google Scholar). Fourth, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, Ras-induced DNA synthesis was dependent upon Rb (42Peeper D.S. Upton T.M. Lahda M. Neuman E. Zalvide J. Bernards R. DeCaprio J.A. Ewen M.E. Nature. 1997; 386: 177-181Google Scholar, 43Leone G. DeGregori J. Sears R. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1997; 387: 422-426Google Scholar). In REF52 cells, serum-induced Rb phosphorylation was blocked by expression of a dominant negative Ras construct (43Leone G. DeGregori J. Sears R. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1997; 387: 422-426Google Scholar). Fifth, evidence for a role of the Ras → Raf → MEK → ERK pathway in the regulation of the cell cycle was provided by the use of apigenin, a plant flavonoid. In Ras-transformed cells, apigenin reverses the transformed phenotype, diminishes ERK activity and expression of the oncogenes c-fos and c-jun (33Kuo M.L. Yang N.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 212: 91767-91775Google Scholar), and arrests the cell cycle at the G0-G1 interface (31Lepley D.M. Pelling J.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 19: 74-82Google Scholar). Apigenin also inhibited the activity of CDK2 kinase and increased the levels of hypophosphorylated Rb in human diploid fibroblasts (31Lepley D.M. Pelling J.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 19: 74-82Google Scholar). Although the previous studies might lead one to believe that the link between the Ras → Raf → MEK → ERK and Rb phosphorylation/cell cycle control is clearly defined, this is not the case. Oncogenic v-Abl kinase induces phosphorylation of Rb via a pathway that requires Ras and Raf but that bypasses MEK (44Renshaw M.W. Lea-Chou E. Wang J.Y.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 76-83Google Scholar, 45Zou X. Rudchenko S. Wong K. Calame K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 654-662Google Scholar). Moreover, in primary cultures of rat Schwann cells, activated Raf actually arrests the cell cycle (46Lloyd A.C. Obermüller F. Staddon S. Barth C.F. McMahon M. Land H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 663-677Google Scholar). It also has been noted that ERK activation is not required for the activation of cyclin D1-CDK4 in human breast cancer cells (47Lukas J. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6917-6925Google Scholar). There is also evidence that a second pathway involving PI3K and p70 S6 kinase (48Wilson M. Burt A.R. Milligan G. Anderson N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8537-8540Google Scholar), which is distinct from the Ras/MEK pathway (49Petritsch C. Woscholski R. Edelmann H.M. Ballou L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26619-26625Google Scholar), can regulate the cell cycle. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, insulin-like growth factor stimulated cyclin D1 synthesis and hyperphosphorylation of Rb, but these effects are not sensitive to blockade of MEK by PD98059 (50Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teefelen H.A. van Schaik F.M. van der Burg B. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31163-31171Google Scholar, 51Alblas J. Slager-Davidov R. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. van Der Burg B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 131-139Google Scholar). Rather, they are sensitive to chemical inhibitors of PI3K (50Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teefelen H.A. van Schaik F.M. van der Burg B. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31163-31171Google Scholar). Similarly, phosphorylation of Rb by interleukin 2 in T-cells depends upon PI3K, but not the Ras → Raf → MEK → ERK pathway (52Brennan P. Babbage J.W. Burgering J.M. Groner B. Reif K. Cantrell D.A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 679-689Google Scholar). In VSMC, rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70 S6 kinase, blocked phosphorylation of Rb induced by 20% serum, but this effect was apparent only after 6 hours (53Marx S.O. Jayaraman T. Go L.O. Marks A.R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 412-417Google Scholar). In addition, activation of PI3K alone has been shown to promote cell cycle entry in 3Y1 rat embryo fibroblasts (54Klippel A. Escobedo M.A. Wachowicz M.S. Apell G. Brown T.W. Giedlin M.A. Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5699-5711Google Scholar). In our study, we found no evidence that PI3K or p70 S6 kinase participate in the rapid phosphorylation of Rb induced by Ang II or 5-HT. Although most studies have focused on longer term phosphorylation of Rb, others have shown that Rb can be phosphorylated within minutes by mitogens (55Felzien L.K. Branden M.G. Benedict S.H. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 507-517Google Scholar). The current work demonstrates that application of 5-HT or Ang II to quiescent VSMC results in the rapid phosphorylation of Ser795 of Rb and that this phosphorylation requires activation of MEK/ERK pathway. Moreover, it is highly likely that the phosphorylation of Ser795 is mediated in large part by CDK4. These results are consistent with the findings of Connell-Crowley et al. (14Connell-Crowley L. Harper J.W. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 297-301Google Scholar), who used a microinjection assay to show that phosphorylation of Rb Ser795 by cyclin D1/CDK4 was critical for inactivation of Rb-mediated growth suppression in SAOS-2 osteogenic sarcoma cells. Moreover, Pan et al. (56Pan W. Sun T. Hoess R. Grafstorm R. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 765-769Google Scholar) recently suggested that Rb Ser795 is the preferred phosphorylation site for CDK4/cyclin D1 based on in vitro mutational analyses. Rb function depends, at least in part, on interactions with the E2F family of DNA-binding transcription factors. E2F sites are found in the promoters of many genes that are important for cell cycle progression, and Rb appears to repress transcription of these genes through its interaction with E2F (57Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Google Scholar, 58Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Google Scholar). Rb-mediated inactivation of E2F may occur by at least two different mechanisms. First, Rb can bind to the E2F transcription factor within its transactivation domain, thus blocking its ability to activate transcription. Second, Rb can be recruited to DNA by E2F to assemble a repressor complex that can actively repress transcription (58Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Google Scholar). However, because many of the studies in tissue culture cells have relied on overexpression of E2F- and Rb-family proteins, the relative contributions of transactivation by free E2F or displacement of an active Rb-E2F repressor complex to the cell progression through the cell cycle remains unclear. The E2F family of transcription factors binds DNA as heterodimers in conjunction with the DP family of factors (59Helin K. Wu C.L. Fattaey A.R. Lees J.A. Dynlacht B.D. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1850-1861Google Scholar). DP-1, the best studied member of the DP family of proteins, by itself has little transcriptional activity, but it cooperates with the E2Fs to activate transcription of the E2F target genes (59Helin K. Wu C.L. Fattaey A.R. Lees J.A. Dynlacht B.D. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1850-1861Google Scholar). Studies using a dominant negative mutant of DP-1 showed inhibition of progression of cells into S phase, suggesting that interaction of E2F/DP with promoters is important for cell cycle progression (60Wu C.L. Classon M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3698-3706Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the rapid phosphorylation of Ser795 of Rb induced by 5-HT or Ang II in VSMC could be functionally significant, because treatment of cells with mitogens resulted in an ∼30% decrease in the amount of E2F-1 in Rb immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6). At the same time, inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway by pretreatment of VSMC with PD98059 caused a slight increase in the amount of E2F-1 in Rb immunoprecipitates, suggesting that ERK-dependent phosphorylation of Rb plays a role in E2F-Rb interactions. The relatively small level of dissociation of E2F-1 from Rb in our experiments could mean that G protein-coupled receptors need to collaborate with the other mechanisms to fully inactivate Rb. This is not surprising, because binding of Rb to E2F most likely is regulated by multiple phosphorylation sites (12Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Google Scholar, 61Brown V.D. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3246-3256Google Scholar, 62Ma D. Zhou P. Harbour J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19358-19366Google Scholar). It has been suggested that phosphorylation by cyclin D-CDK4/6 and cyclin E-CDK2 was necessary to completely hyperphosphorylate Rb and block Rb binding to E2F (62Ma D. Zhou P. Harbour J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19358-19366Google Scholar). Moreover, regulation of Rb function by phosphorylation appears to be even more complex after recent studies have suggested that unphosphorylated Rb is inactive in G0 and that initial phosphorylation by CDK4/6 leads to a hypophosphorylated, active protein that is assembled with E2Fs in vivo (63Ezhevsky S.A. Ho A. Becker-Hapak M. Davis P.K. Dowdy S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4773-4784Google Scholar). Thus, it does not seem likely that 5-HT- and Ang II-induced selective phosphorylation of Rb Ser795 is sufficient to cause the transition of cells through G1. The subsequent fate of E2F-1 released from Rb after 5-HT and Ang II treatment remains unclear. One possibility is that E2F-1 interacts with DP-1 to deliver it to the nucleus. It has been shown that DP-1 lacks an autonomous nuclear localization signal; therefore, its presence in nuclei depends upon an interaction with the appropriate E2F partner, which subsequently causes the efficient nuclear accumulation of DP proteins (64Magae J. Wu C.L. Illenye S. Harlow E. Heintz N.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1717-1726Google Scholar, 65Allen K.E. de la Luna S. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2819-2831Google Scholar). Taking into consideration that DP-1 in most cell types is constitutively expressed during the cell cycle, whereas the expression of E2F-1 is under cell cycle control, the fact that heterodimer formation promotes nuclear accumulation provides a mechanism whereby the induction of nuclear E2F-DP complexes is dependent on a rate-limiting E2F partner (66de la Luna S. Burden M.J. Lee C.W. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2443-2452Google Scholar). What is new about this work is that we show a novel and selective phosphorylation of Rb Ser795 by mitogens (Ang II and 5-HT) and demonstrate an unexpected rapid linkage between the actions of the Ras → Raf → MEK → ERK pathway and the phosphorylation state of Rb. Ang II and 5-HT induce complex formation between CDK4, cyclin D1, and the active form of ERK1/2. Rb Ser795 phosphorylation is likely mediated by CDK4 and requires the activity of MEK-ERK pathway (Fig. 7). Moreover, this rapid phosphorylation is functionally significant in that it correlates with dissociation of E2F-1 from Rb. These findings support the possibility that mitogens can regulate cell cycle machinery within minutes in addition to their well established interactions that require hours to manifest either functionally or biochemically. We thank Georgiann Collinsworth and Jana Fine for excellent technical assistance and Dr. Karthikeyan Kandasamy for helpful suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W2037647201,"The upper jaws of birds, unlike those in many tetrapods, move relative to the skull and are often flexible along their length, whereas the lower jaw (mandible) is usually a rigid structure formed by the fusion of several bones, flexing only where it meets the skull. Here we describe a previously unnoticed mandibular bending movement in hummingbirds, in which the distal half of the mandible is actively flexed downwards and the gape widens to catch flying insects. The hummingbird is thought to have developed a long narrow bill as it specialized in feeding on floral nectar, but the bird's need to supplement its diet with insects must have contributed to the surprising flexibility of its jaw."
https://openalex.org/W2059391844,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling leading to nuclear factor-κB activation in mononuclear phagocytes involves interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), which is rapidly activated after exposure to agonist. Although it is known that IRAK also undergoes rapid inactivation/degradation in response to LPS, providing negative feedback leading to LPS tolerance, mechanisms governing IRAK degradation are not fully understood. In the present study, examination of LPS signaling showed that IRAK degradation was bimodal and involved dual receptors and distinct pathways. Rapid degradation of IRAK, occurring within 30 min of exposure to agonist, was shown to signal through CD14/TLR4 and was regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. A second delayed wave of IRAK degradation occurred 2 h after exposure to LPS and was mediated by CR3 independently of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Thus, multiple independent mechanisms have evolved to regulate IRAK degradation, likely reflecting the importance of limiting cellular responses to LPS. Recognition of a CR3-dependent, CD14/TLR4-independent pathway leading to IRAK degradation has implications for understanding modulation of LPS responses by cells with important immunoregulatory function such as dendritic cells that are CD14–.

https://openalex.org/W2047478408,"Previous work suggests that superoxide mediates hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced constriction of isolated mouse coronary arteries (CA). To determine the source of superoxide overproduction during H/R we studied CA obtained from transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing human CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and mice lacking gp91phox using an in vitro vascular ring bioassay. We found that under normoxic conditions CA isolated from wild type (wt) mice, CuZn-SOD Tg mice and gp91phox knock-out mice had similar contractile responses to U46619 and hypoxia and similar dilation responses to acetylcholine. In wt CA, 30 min of hypoxia (1% O2) followed by reoxygenation (16% O2) resulted in further coronary vasoconstriction (internal diameter from 105 ± 11 to 84.5 ± 17.9 μm), whereas this response was completely blocked in both CuZn-SOD Tg and gp91phox knock-out CA (104.3 ± 10.5 to 120.7 ± 14 μm and 143.3 ± 15.3 to 172.7 ± 12.5 μm, respectively, p < 0.01). Furthermore, we show that H/R enhances the generation of superoxide radicals in wt CA (25.8 ± 0.7 relative light units per second (RLU/s)), whereas CuZn-SOD Tg CA (12.2 ± 0.8 RLU/s, p < 0.01) and gp91phox CA (12.5 ± 0.9 RLU/s, p < 0.01) show reduced levels. These results demonstrate that H/R-induced vasoconstriction is mediated by intracellular superoxide overproduction via endothelial NADPH oxidase gp91phox. Therefore, increasing endogenous levels of CuZn-SOD in CA may provide a novel cardioprotective strategy for maintaining coronary perfusion under conditions of H/R. Previous work suggests that superoxide mediates hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced constriction of isolated mouse coronary arteries (CA).

https://openalex.org/W2021513697,"CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), a key enzyme that controls phosphatidylcholine synthesis, is regulated by reversible interactions with membranes containing anionic lipids. Previous work demonstrated that CCT is a homodimer. In this work we show that the structure of the dimer interface is altered upon encountering membranes that activate CCT. Chemical cross-linking reactions were established which captured intradimeric interactions but not random CCT dimer collisions. The efficiency of capturing covalent cross-links with four different reagents was diminished markedly upon presentation of activating anionic lipid vesicles but not zwitterionic vesicles. Experiments were conducted to show that the anionic vesicles did not interfere with the chemistry of the cross-linking reactions and did not sequester available cysteine sites on CCT for reaction with the cysteine-directed cross-linking reagent. Thus, the loss of cross-linking efficiency suggested that contact sites at the dimer interface had increased distance or reduced flexibility upon binding of CCT to membranes. The regions of the enzyme involved in dimerization were mapped using three approaches: 1) limited proteolysis followed by cross-linking of fragments, 2) yeast two-hybrid analysis of interactions between select domains, and 3) disulfide bonding potential of CCTs with individual cysteine to serine substitutions for the seven native cysteines. We found that the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–72) is an important participant in forming the dimer interface, in addition to the catalytic domain (amino acids 73–236). We mapped the intersubunit disulfide bond to the cystine 37 pair in domain N and showed that this disulfide is sensitive to anionic vesicles, implicating this specific region in the membrane-sensitive dimer interface.

It is activated by reversible binding to cell membrane lipids (1Cornell R.B. Northwood I.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The most potent lipid activators are anionic phospholipids and fatty acids (2Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5873-5880Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3Arnold R.S. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9917-9924Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Type II lipids such as diacylglycerol, unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine, and oxidized PCs will also promote the binding and activation of this enzyme (3Arnold R.S. Cornell R.B.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15606-15614Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this regulatory mechanism enables CCT to respond to decreases in the relative PC content of cell membranes and thus maintain PC homeostasis (6Sleight R. Kent C. J. Biol.

The membrane binding domain has been mapped to an internal 50–60- residue amphipathic α-helix (8Craig L. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3311-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dunne S.J. Cornell R.B. Johnson J.E. Glover N.R. Tracey A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11975-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This domain acts as an autoinhibitory domain in the soluble form of the enzyme (10Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol.

It is a mixed structure in the lipid-free enzyme, but upon membrane binding it adopts a purely α-helical conformation (12Taneva S. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11768-11776Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). How does partitioning into a membrane bilayer relieve the inhibition at the active site? As part of our effort to answer this question we have examined changes in the quaternary interactions of the CCT dimer upon interaction with lipid vesicles. Early work established a homodimer structure for CCT by chemical cross-linking (13Cornell R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9077-9082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by gel filtration and sedimentation (14Weinhold P.A. Rounsifer M.E. Charles L. Feldman D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Craig et al. (8Craig L. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3311-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provided the first hint that the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein are sufficient for dimerization. After proteolytic digestion, which removed the more sensitive C-terminal domains, a species double the mass of the major N-terminal fragment could be detected on SDS-gels. The first x-ray structure of a cytidylyltransferase (glycerolphosphate cytidylyltransferase; GCT), which is homologous to the catalytic domain (amino acids 78–210) of CCT, showed that this fold interacts as a homodimer and gave insight into the dimer interface (15Weber C.H. Park Y.S. Sanker S. Kent C. Ludwig M.L. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In particular, the Arg within one of three signature motifs for the cytidylyltransferase family, 139RYVDEVV145, is found at the dimer interface in GCT. A CCT truncated at residue 236, containing the N-terminal domain plus the entire catalytic domain, migrates as a dimer on gels after chemical cross-linking and in sedimentation analysis (11Friesen J.A. Campbell H.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13384-13389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This suggests that the dimerization of CCTα does not require the C-terminal region. There are no data from these papers specifying that the catalytic domain alone mediates dimerization. Other domains may participate in addition to the catalytic domain. For purposes of this work, the domains of CCT are designated domain N (1–72), domain C (73–236), domain M (237–300), and domain P (301–367) (Fig. 1). The boundaries are approximate. One goal of the present work was to map out which domains are involved in dimerization. This problem was approached using 1) chemical cross-linking of a limited protease digest of purified CCT followed by SDS-PAGE and antibody mapping to identify cross-linked species; 2) yeast two-hybrid interaction analysis of various CCT fragments; and 3) comparison of the disulfide bonding potential of CCTs with individual cysteine to serine substitutions for the seven native cysteines. The results show that along with the catalytic domain the N-terminal domain (1–72) contributes to dimerization. The other goal was to examine whether the dimer interaction is modulated by membrane binding. We found that membrane binding perturbs the dimer interface, as detected by a loss of chemical cross-linking potential. This may reflect increased distance between contact sites or reduced flexibility at those sites. Materials—α-Chymotrypsin, PMSF, and phosphoglycerate mutase were from Sigma.

SYPRO Orange protein gel stain was from Amersham Biosciences. Microcon-30 filters were from Amicon. Yeast Two-hybrid Construction and Analysis—Constructs were prepared which linked the LexA DNA binding domain (DBD) or the Gal4 activation domain (AD) to the N termini of full-length CCT or CCT fragments (amino acids 1–236, domains N + C; 73–239, domain C; 237–367, domains M + P). For this purpose we used the yeast expression vectors pBTM116 containing full-length LexA (18Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1993: 153Google Scholar), and pACT2 containing residues 768–881 of Gal4 and a nuclear targeting signal upstream of the Gal4 domain (24Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). All CCT sequences were inserted in-frame into the BamHI or BamHI/SalI sites in the linker regions of these vectors. We engineered stop codons and BamHI or SalI sites flanking the CCT sequences by PCR mutagenesis, using WT rat CCTα in pAX142 (16Cornell R.B. Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Johnson M.A. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) as the template DNA. For CCT(1–367) and CCT(1–236) the 5′-primer was 5′-AT AGG ATC CCT TAT AAC ATG1 GAT2 GCA3 CAG4 AGT5 TCA6 GCT7 AAA8 GTC9-3′ (BamHI site in italics), adding a linker encoding RYN before the first CCT codon (CCT codons indicated with superscript). The 3′-primer for CCT(1–236) was 5′-ATA GGA TCCTCAstop GTT236 GAT235 AAA234 GCT233 GAC232 ATT231 GAG230 CTC229-3′. The 3′-primer for CCT(1–367) was ATA GGA TCCTCAstop GTC367 CTC366 TTC365 ATC364 CTC363 GCT362 GAT361 GTC360. These oligonucleotides introduced stop codons after codon 236 or 367 followed by the BamHI site. The CCT(237–367) construct was generated with the same 3′-primer as used to generate CCT(1–367), and the 5′-primer was 5′-AT AGG ATC CGT TAT AAC ATG GAA237 AAG238 AAA239 TAC240 CAC241 TTG242 CAA243 GAA244-3′, which added RYNM to the linker sequence just before CCT codon 237. CCT(73–239) was generated using a 5′-primer, 5′-AT AGG ATC CGT TAT AAC ATG TGT73 GAG74 CGG75 CCT76 GTG77 AGA78 GTT79-3′. The 3′ primer was 5′-T CGT CGA CTAstop TTT239 CTT238 TTC237 GTT236 G-3′, which introduced a SalI site flanking the stop codon following codon 239. The correct sequences were checked by inserting the amplified DNA into the BamHI or BamHI/SalI sites of pBS KS+ and sequencing both strands. For the pBTM and pACT CCT1–367 constructs a 1.1-kb 3′-EcoRI fragment was replaced with an EcoRI fragment from a previously sequenced full-length CCT so that only the 5′-end of the new construct required sequencing. To test interactions we used yeast strain Y274 containing the promoter sequence specific for LexA upstream of His-3 and LacZ, and lacking leucine and tryptophan synthases for selection of pBTM116 and pACT2 transformants. Yeast cells were made competent by modification of a lithium acetate procedure (24Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and were transformed using 33% polyethylene glycol and a 15-min, 42 °C heat shock (24Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected by culturing in leucine- and tryptophan-deficient medium at 30 °C for 48 h. To quantify the levels of LacZ expression, yeast cell lysates were prepared from mid-log phase cultures (A600 nm = 1.0). Cells from 3-ml cultures were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 min and were suspended in 160 μl of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4) with 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. 40 μl of sample was diluted to 1 ml with 0.15 m NaCl, 3.7% formaldehyde, and the A600 nm was determined. The remainder was solubilized by adding sarkosyl and toluene to final concentrations of 0.2%, and 3.8%, respectively. The sample was vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 s. The solvent was evaporated from the supernatant, and 100 μl was mixed with 650 μl of Z buffer containing 0.67 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside to initiate the β-galactosidase reaction. The reaction was quenched at various times with 250 μl of 1 m Na2CO3 to a final concentration of 250 mm. The absorbance at 420 nm was determined. The units of β-galactosidase activity were calculated as shown in Equation 1. units=(A420 nm×40μl)/(A600 nm×100μl×time) (Eq. 1) Isolation of Yeast Spheroplasts and Nuclei and Analysis of Expression Levels of CCT Constructs—Cell walls were digested by zymolyase in the presence of 1 m sorbitol, essentially as described previously (25Randez-Gil F. Herrero P. Sanz P. Prieto J.A. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Preparation of spheroplasts was checked by microscopy. Nuclei were isolated from Dounce-homogenized spheroplasts by differential sedimentation in 18% Ficoll (25Randez-Gil F. Herrero P. Sanz P. Prieto J.A. Moreno F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The nuclear prep was stained with DAPI and examined by microscopy using a Zeiss LSM-410 confocal microscope to assess the enrichment with nuclei. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (26Northwood I.C. Tong A.H. Crawford B. Drobnies A.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26240-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) except that that transfer buffer was 39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris, 0.0375% SDS, pH 8.7. For immunofluorescence analysis of CCT localization, spheroplasts were absorbed onto 0.1% polylysine-coated slides. The cells were fixed using sequential methanol and acetone baths at -20 °C, for 6 min and 30 s, respectively. After blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, anti-hemagglutinin or anti-domain M antibodies were added in blocking buffer using a dilution of 1:100 for incubation over-night at 20 °C. After five washes, the secondary antibodies conjugated to Oregon Green or Texas Red were applied at 1:100 dilution in blocking buffer. The slides were prepared for viewing with Prolong antifade. The cells were viewed with a Zeiss LSM-410 microscope (26Northwood I.C. Tong A.H. Crawford B. Drobnies A.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26240-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Construction of Cys Mutants—WT CCTα was engineered with an N-terminal His-tag by PCR amplification using pBSKS(-) WT rat CCTα as the template. The forward primer, 5′-CAG CAG GTC TAG ACG CGT AGG ACC ATG GCT AAG CAC CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC ata gaa gga aga TCT GCC ATG1 GAT2 GCA3 CAG4 AGT5 TC-3′ introduced the His-tag (bold), a Factor Xa site (lowercase), and an optimal translation initiation sequence (underlined). Superscripts denote CCT codons. T3 was used as the reverse primer. The PCR product was inserted into pBSKS(-) at the XbaI and SalI sites. For expression in COS cells it was inserted in pAX142 at the MluI and SalI sites. The C139S was engineered by PCR using as template a His-tagged WT CCT in pBSKS(-) with a deleted SalI site. The forward primer was the His-tag-generating primer (see above), and the reverse primer introduced the mutation (underlined) at codon 139 followed by the AccI site (italics): 5′-CAC145 CTC144GTC143TAC142 GTA141 TCT140AGA139 ATG138 CTG137 CAC136 CGC135 GTC134-3′. The PCR product was inserted into pBS WT CCT with a deleted SalI site using MluI and AccI. For expression in COS cells it was inserted in pAX142 at the MluI and EcoRV sites. To construct CCT with serines at positions 354 and 359, WT CCT in pBSKS(-) was PCR amplified with the forward primer: 5′-CCA348 GCA349AGC350TTA351 TCC352AGA353TCT354 AAG355 GCT356 GTG357ACT358AGT359 GAC360 ATC361 AGC362 GAG363-3′, to introduce Cys to Ser mutations (underlined) as well as three new restriction sites: HindIII, BglII, and SpeI (italics). T3 was used as the reverse primer. His-tagged WT CCT was amplified using 5′-GA CTG CCG CGG GTT53 GAC54 TTT55 AGT56 AAG57-3′ as a forward primer and 5′-CCT353 AGA352 TAA351GCT350TGC349 TGG348 GGA347 GGA346-3′ as a reverse primer to create a HindIII site (italics). The HindIII to XhoI fragment of the C354,359S DNA was ligated with the SstI to HindIII fragment of the pBS His-tagged WT CCT amplification. The resulting SstI to XhoI fragment was then inserted into SstI/XhoI-cleaved pBSKS(-) His-tagged WT CCT. For expression in COS cells the construct was inserted into pAX142 using MluI and SalI sites. Further single cysteine to serine mutations were engineered using the QuikChange PCR mutagenesis materials (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR template was His-tagged WT CCTα in pBSKS(-). The complementary primer pairs replaced the cysteine codon with a serine codon. The sequences of the mutagenic codons of the forward primers were: C37S, TGT37 to TCT37; C68S, TGC68 to AGC68; C73S, TGT73 to TCT73; C113S, TGC113 to AGC113. The MluI to EcoRV fragments of the single cysteine mutants were each subcloned into MluI/EcoRV-cleaved pAX142-WT CCT. Cysteine-free CCT was engineered by replacing the N-terminal cysteines with serines one after another using the QuikChange PCR mutagenesis kit, with pBS-His-tagged C139S CCT as a template. MluI and EcoRV were used to subclone this into pAX142-HisC354,359S CCT. A single cysteine was engineered back into codon 37 using His-tagged Cys-free CCT in pBSKS(-) as a template. The sequence of the mutagenic codon of the forward primer was TCT37 to TGC37. All mutants were sequenced in pBSKS(-) to ensure correct sequence. Purification of Untagged CCT and Activity Assay—The α isoform of rat CCT was expressed in Trichoplusia ni cells using the baculovirus system (19MacDonald J.I. Kent C. Protein Expr. Purif. 1993; 4: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It was purified by the method of Friesen et al. (11Friesen J.A. Campbell H.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13384-13389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with modifications (4Davies S.M. Epand R.M. Kraayenhof R. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10522-10531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The purified CCT was stored in Buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) at -80 °C. The CCT activity assay was carried out as described previously (20Sohal P.S. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11746-11750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.1 mm PC/oleic acid (1:1)-sonicated vesicles. Expression and Purification of His-tagged CCTs—COS-1 cells were transfected for 68 h with the His-tagged CCT cDNA constructs in pAX142 (16Cornell R.B. Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Johnson M.A. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The soluble fraction was prepared as described previously (27Johnson J.E. Xie M. Singh L.M. Egde R. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 514-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), except the homogenization buffer was 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, containing a full compliment of protease inhibitors. Prior to the high speed centrifugation, binding buffer was added from a 10× stock to a final concentration of 5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 15 mm imidazole. A 1/8 volume of 50% nickel-agarose beads was incubated with the soluble protein by rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole, 1% Nonidet P-40 and three times with 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole. His-tagged proteins were eluted with 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 350 mm imidazole. The CCT in the preparations purified by this method represented from 61 to 88% of the total protein in the samples, as assessed by densitometry of silver or SYPRO Orange-stained gels. The activities of the purified CCTs were determined as described above. α-Chymotrypsin Digestion—The reactions were carried out typically in a volume of 30 μl at 37 °C in a shaking water bath for various times using 1–4 μm CCT, a 1:150 weight ratio of chymotrypsin to CCT, and Buffer A with 0.15 mm Triton X-100. The reactions were initiated with chymotrypsin and were stopped with PMSF to a final concentration of 2 mm. A 10 mm PMSF solution in ∼90 °C water was prepared from a 0.5 m dimethyl sulfoxide stock immediately before the assay and was maintained at 37 °C. Some of the samples were prequenched with PMSF prior to chymotrypsin treatment. Other digested samples were subsequently reacted with glutaraldehyde within 2 min of adding PMSF (see below). Samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Cross-linking Reactions—Stocks of CuSO4 and phenanthrolene were mixed 1:3 immediately before initiating the reactions. For cross-linking with Cu(Phe)3 or DSP, the dithiothreitol and Tris were removed from the CCT preparation by dialysis against 20 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.15 mm Triton X-100 or by Microcon-30 filtration followed by three washes in the above buffer. For other reactions this step was not needed. The reactions were typically in a volume of 30 μl at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. The reaction buffer was 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, the Triton concentration was adjusted to be equivalent in all samples (generally 75 μm), and the concentrations of CCT (0.5–8 μm) and phospholipid vesicles were as specified in the figure legends. Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared by sonication as described previously (3Arnold R.S. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9917-9924Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The reactions were initiated with cross-linking reagent using the concentrations and incubation times specified in the figure legends. The glutaraldehyde reaction was quenched with 100 mm ethanolamine; the DSP reaction was quenched with 100 mm ammonium acetate, Cu(Phe)3 was quenched with 10 mm NEM, and BS3 was quenched with 0.1 m glycine, pH 6.5. Some samples were prequenched prior to the addition of cross-linker. Samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Labeling with [14C]NEM—The reaction with NEM was done in a volume of 20 μl and used 2.5 μm CCT (dithiothreitol-free), 225 μm [14C]NEM (specific activity, 39 Ci/mol) in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.075 mm Triton X-100, with or without 500 μm PG vesicles. The sample was incubated with shaking for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by boiling for 3 min in Laemmli sample buffer containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol. The stained CCT bands were excised from the gel, treated with 50% H2O2 at 70 °C for 17 h, and the radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation counting. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—Samples were boiled for 3 min in sample buffer prior to separation of components by SDS-PAGE using 10 or 12% acrylamide (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205463) Google Scholar). For Cu(Phe)3 and DSP cross-linked samples, the sample buffer did not contain β-mercaptoethanol. SYPRO Orange staining of gels was done as described by the manufacturer, and the gels were visualized on the Typhoon 9410 Variable Mode Imager with a 488 nm laser and a 580 nm filter. Silver staining of gels was done as described previously (22Poehling H.-M. Neuhoff V. Electrophoresis. 1981; 2: 141-147Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were done as described (23Veitch D.P. Gilham D. Cornell R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with an antibody directed against the N-terminal 15 amino acids (15Weber C.H. Park Y.S. Sanker S. Kent C. Ludwig M.L. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 1113-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or residues 256–288 of domain M (17Johnson J.E. Aebersold R. Drobnies A. Cornell R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1324: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Immunoblots with an antibody directed against residues 164–176 of domain C were done at 37 °C with both the primary antibody (anti-domain C), and the secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase, diluted 1:1,000 in 1% gelatin, 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline. Cross-linking Captures Intradimeric Interactions—In this work we used a variety of cross-linking reagents to probe the quaternary interactions of CCT. Glutaraldehyde is a relatively nonselective reagent that can form covalent bonds with heteroatoms on lysine, tyrosine, histidine, and cysteine side chains (28Habeeb A. Hiramoto R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). These reactive groups must approach within ∼7 Å to be cross-linked by the aldehydes. DSP and BS3 contain succinimidyl groups separated by ∼12 Å that react selectively with lysine amino groups. Cu(Phe)3 selectively oxidizes cysteine sulfhydryls. When lipid-free CCT was incubated with glutaraldehyde or the succinimidyl-based reagents, the 42-kDa monomer species observed on gels was converted to a diffuse molecular set between 80 and 110 kDa (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 4–6; Fig. 3, A, lanes 2–5, and C, lanes 2–4). Autoxidation during the dialysis step preceding treatment with DSP or Cu(Phe)3 generated species at 84 kDa and ∼120 kDa in addition to the monomeric band (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–3). After incubation with Cu(Phe)3 the 84 and 120 kDa bands became predominant, and the 42 kDa band disappeared (Fig. 2C, lanes 4–6). The diffuse DSP-linked band at 80–110 kDa has been identified as heterogeneously linked homodimers by two-dimensional electrophoresis (9Dunne S.J. Cornell R.B. Johnson J.E. Glover N.R. Tracey A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11975-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The identity of the 120 kDa disulfide-linked species has not been resolved. The predominance of this band varied from experiment to experiment (e.g. see Fig. 4C). In addition, higher order cross-linked oligomers were present in many samples as minor species (Fig. 2).Fig. 3PG vesicles diminish cross-linking efficiency.A, 0.39 μm CCT was preincubated 2 min with or without 300 μm PG vesicles.

RNA from rat embryonic day 12 and 13 sciatic nerves, a stage when nerves contain Schwann cell precursors, was used to identify several genes not previously described in Schwann cells. One of them, zinc finger protein (ZFP)-57, proved to be the homologue of a mouse gene found in F9 teratocarcinoma cells. Its mRNA expression profile within embryonic and adult normal and transected peripheral nerves, and its distribution in the rest of the nervous system is described. High levels of expression are seen in embryonic nerves and spinal cord. These drop rapidly during the first few weeks after birth, a pattern mirrored in other parts of the nervous system. ZFP-57 localizes to the nucleus of Schwann and other cells. The sequence contains an N-terminal Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and ZFP-57 constructs containing green fluorescent protein reveal that the protein colocalizes with heterochromatin protein 1α to centromeric heterochromatin in a characteristic speckled pattern in NIH3T3 cells. The KRAB domain is required for this localization, because constructs lacking it target the protein to the nucleus but not to the centromeric heterochromatin. When fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain, the KRAB domain of ZFP-57 represses transcription, and full-length ZFP-57 represses Schwann cell transcription from myelin basic protein and P0 promoters in co-transfection assays. Zfp-57 mRNA is up-regulated in Schwann cells in response to leukemia inhibitory factor and fibroblast growth factor 2.

These cells are the source of the myelinating or non-myelinating cells of adult nerves. Schwann cell precursors can be distinguished from immature Schwann cells on the one hand and from neural crest cells on the other by a number of criteria, including differences in the regulation of survival and DNA synthesis and antigenic phenotype (5Jessen K.R.

Glial Cell Development: Basic Principles and Clinical Relevance. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, 2001: 1-20Google Scholar). A number of transcription factors are involved in the cellular transitions that take place in embryonic nerves and early post-natal nerves (9Mirsky R. Jessen K.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 10Topilko P. Meijer D. Glial Cell Development: Basic Principles and Clinical Relevance. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, 2001: 223-244Google Scholar). The HMG domain factor Sox-10 is expressed in most or all neural crest cells and is required for the formation of the glial lineage (11Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Britsch S. Goerich D.E. Riethmacher D. Peirano R.I. Rossner M. Nave K.A. Birchmeier C. Wegner M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 66-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). It is also likely to be important in later stages of development, because it has the capacity to synergize with Krox-20 (Egr-2) (see below) to activate the connexin 32 promoter (13Topilko P. Schneider-Manoury S. Levi G. Baron-Van Evercooren A. Chennoufi A.B.Y. Seitanidou T. Babinet C. Charnay P. Nature. 1994; 371: 796-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 14Peirano R.I.

Two transcription factors, the POU domain proteins Oct-6 (SCIP, Tst-1, Pou3f1) and Brn-2 are involved in the timing of myelination (16Jaegle M. Mandemakers W. Broos L. Zwart R. Karis A. Visser P.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1380-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), whereas Schwann cells in nerves of mice that are null for the zinc finger protein Krox-20 are arrested at the 1:1 promyelinating stage and fail to develop myelin, implying a crucial role for this transcription factor in the initiation of myelination (13Topilko P. Schneider-Manoury S. Levi G. Baron-Van Evercooren A. Chennoufi A.B.Y. Seitanidou T. Babinet C. Charnay P. Nature. 1994; 371: 796-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Recently, gene array technology has been used to identify some of the genes that are regulated by Krox-20. These include many myelin protein and lipid genes (19Nagarajan R. Svaren J. Le N. Araki T. Watson M. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 355-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Krox-20 also has a key role in removing Schwann cells from the cell cycle and in inactivating developmental death signals at the onset of myelination (20Parkinson D.B. Bhaskaran A. Droggiti A. Dickinson S. D'Antonio M. Mirsky R. Jessen K.R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In an in vitro neuron-Schwann cell co-culture system the transcription factor NFκB is also required for myelin formation (21Nickols J.C. Valentine W. Kanwal S. Carter B.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Eight zinc finger proteins, five of which have been shown to be transcription factors, have previously been identified in Schwann cells (13Topilko P. Schneider-Manoury S. Levi G.

A. 2002; 99: 8998-9003Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Three of the transcription factors are members of the Egr family, which has four members. They include Krox-20 (above), and the related proteins Krox-24 (Egr-1) and Egr-3. Krox-24-null mice do not have any obvious peripheral nerve phenotype although the gene is strongly expressed in embryonic development and in adult life in non-myelinating Schwann cells (26Slutsky S.G.

Desmarquet C. Mancardi G. Charnay P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The Egr family, however, comprises only a small proportion of the total number of known zinc finger transcription factors, more than 700 of which have been identified. Among the zinc finger genes about one third contain an N-terminal domain known as the KRAB domain, which acts as a powerful transcriptional repressor even when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain (DBD) in a variety of systems (28Margolin J.F.

In the case of many KRAB domain zinc finger proteins, this domain is known to associate with a co-repressor protein KAP-1 (TIF1β/KRIP-1) (30Abrink M. Ortiz J.A. Mark C. Sanchez C. Looman C.

KAP-1 in turn associates with heterochromatin protein (HP) 1α, a dose-dependent mediator of heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing (33Ryan R.F. Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K. Singh P.B. Friedman J.R.

In 3T3 and CHO cells HP1α is normally highly enriched in centromeric heterochomatin although it is present in euchromatic regions as well (33Ryan R.F. Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K. Singh P.B. Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4366-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The fourth identified zinc finger protein in Schwann cells, Kzf1, is a KRAB domain protein that was identified as a Krox-20 responsive gene in a gene array screen but has not been studied further (19Nagarajan R. Svaren J. Le N. Araki T. Watson M. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 355-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To isolate zinc finger genes that are expressed early in the Schwann cell lineage, we used RNA taken from embryonic peripheral nerves at a stage when Schwann cell precursors are the predominant cell population. We designed a screening strategy based on RT-PCR, using degenerate primers recognizing the conserved zinc finger sequence to identify several genes containing zinc finger motifs not previously described in Schwann cells. The properties and distribution of one of these, Zfp-57, is described below. This gene, which contains a KRAB domain, shows strong developmental regulation both in the peripheral and central nervous systems, localizes to heterochromatin in cell nuclei and represses activation of myelin promoter and reporter constructs in co-transfection assays. Isolation of a Zinc Finger Motif-enriched cDNA Library—Total RNA was prepared from freshly dissected tissues of E12 and E13 rat sciatic nerves using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The analysis of RNA integrity and cDNA synthesis has been described previously (37Zoidl G. Blass-Kampmann S. D'Urso D. Schmalenbach C. Müller H.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 38Zoidl G. Meier C. Petrasch-Parwez E. Zoidl C. Habbes H.W. Kremer M. Srinivas M. Spray D.C. Dermietzel R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 448-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Zinc finger motif-containing sequences were amplified by PCR using standard reaction conditions for Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) including 25 pmol of primer CysX2 (5′-TGCCCNGAGTGYGGNAAR-3′), H/C (5′-NGGCTTCTCNCCNGTATG-3′), and 1 μl of the first strand cDNA synthesis reaction. The amplification conditions were as follows: 1 initial cycle for 3 min at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles for 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 48 °C and 1 min at 72 °C, and a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. Control reactions included water or total RNA. PCR reaction products were separated on a 2% agarose gel in 1× Tris acetate/EDTA, stained with ethidium bromide, and documented by Polaroid photography. Single bands, representing multiples of the zinc finger motif, were isolated using Qiaex (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) and directly subcloned into the pCR2.1-vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen) to generate a zinc finger motif-enriched cDNA library. Individual clones were randomly selected and sequenced. Randomly selected clones of the zinc finger-enriched cDNA library were grown as single colonies on LB agar plates, transferred onto Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and lysed. Duplicate filters were hybridized with cDNA probes prepared from total RNA of E12 or newborn animals. The radiolabeled probes were generated using a PCR-based amplification method described by Kendall et al. (39Kendall G. Ensor E. Crankson H.D. Latchman D.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The hybridization was carried out at 60 °Cin0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 2 mm EDTA. Posthybridization filters were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and exposed to a Fuji phosphorimager. Biostatistical analysis was performed using the programs BlastN, BlastP, and BlastX (40Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar), LASERGENE (DNASTAR, Madison, WI), ExPasy (www.expasy.ch), SMART (smart.embl-heidelberg.de), Predict-protein (www.embl-heidelberg.de/-predictprotein/) and Phosphobase 2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk). Cloning of the Zfp-57 Protein Coding Region—The full-length protein coding region of the rat Zfp-57 gene (amino acids 1–421) was obtained by RT-PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA) and the primer pair ZFP57-USP2 (5′-GAATGGCATTACCAAACAATGGCAGCTAGG-3′) and ZFP57-DSP2 (5′-TCAGTCCGAATCTTCTGTCAC-AGGACT-3′) with cDNA derived from 10 ng of total mouse or rat testis RNA. The Zfp-57 amplification products were T nucleotide-tailed during the final extension step with 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase, gel-purified, and subcloned into the plasmid pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Six individual transformants of plasmid pCR2.1-rZFP57 were selected and sequenced on both strands to generate an overlapping sequence. All plasmids harboring rat Zfp-57 showed homology to the originally reported mouse sequence. Cloning of the Full-length Mouse Zfp-57 Coding Sequence—The full-length mouse Zfp-57 coding sequence was cloned after reverse transcription of 0.5 μg of RNA isolated from E14.2 embryonic stem cells (a gift from Dr. Rosa Beddington), followed by PCR amplification with the primer pairs ZFP57-F/R11 and F11/ZFP57-R. Aliquots of each of the corresponding products were added as template in a final PCR reaction using primers ZFP57-F and ZFP57-R; this latter reaction yielding the full-length mouse Zfp-57 cDNA. Primer sequences were: ZFP57-F 5′-AAGGATCCCTGTCTTAGCTTCCTTTGTGC-3′, R11 5′-TTCTAGAAATCTCTGATTGTTCTTTCCTG-3′, F11 5′-AAGAACAATCAGAGATTTCTAGAAGTGGG-3′, and ZFP57-R 5′-AAGGATCCCTGTCTTAGCTTCCTTTGTGC-3′. Internal primers F11 and R11 were complementary at their 5′-ends, and each of these primers runs across exons 1 and 2. The full-length cDNA was purified using the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen), digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and cloned into pGEM®-3-Zf(+) (Promega). The construct was verified by sequencing. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—In all cases RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent. In experiments using embryonic, postnatal, and adult tissues first-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA as described above. The primers for semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis were selected for amplification of mRNAs from both mouse and rat. The sequence for rat Zfp-57 was obtained from our sequencing results. The sequences of mouse Zfp-57 (gi:431181), mouse Krox-20 (gi:16758439), rat Krox-20 (gi:23956051), mouse P0 (gi:6678927), rat P0 (gi:8393777), 18 S rRNA (gi:57149), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (gi:193423) are deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base. Primers were: ZFP57-USP (5′-CAAGCACCAGAGCACTCACAGGG-3′), ZFP57-DSP (5′-TGGATTCTCTGGTGTATAATGAGG-3′); GAPDH-USP (5′-CCTTCATTGACCTCAACTACATGGT-3′), and GAPDH-DSP (5′-TCATTGTCATACCAGGAAATGAGCT-3′). Primers for Krox-20, P0, and 18 S RNA were as described previously (41Blanchard A.D. Sinanan A. Parmantier E. Zwart R. Broos L. Meijer D. Meier C. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 630-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 42Owens G.C. Boyd C.J. Development. 1991; 112: 639-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Steady-state mRNA expression levels were determined by RT-PCR in 50-μl reactions containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 25 pmol each primer, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. An initial denaturation cycle of 3 min at 94 °C was followed by 28× (Krox-20), 30× (Zfp-57), or 32× cycles (P0), of30sat94 °C,30sat52 °C and 1 min at 72 °C before a final extension period of 2 min at 72 °C. Samples containing water or RNA were included as controls. Equal cDNA use was confirmed by amplification of 18 S rRNA by PCR (37Zoidl G. Blass-Kampmann S. D'Urso D. Schmalenbach C. Müller H.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). For the postnatal time course, primers were as follows: ZFP57-USP (5′-GCATTACCAAACAATGGCAGCTAG-3′), ZFP-57-DSP (5′-AGGCCTCTCTCCACGATGCTGAGCC-3′) for Zfp-57, and GAPDH-USP (5′-CCTTCATTGACCTCAACTACATGGT-3′), GAPDH-DSP (5′-TCATTGTCATACCAGGAAATGAGCT-3′) as an invariant control. For the experiments with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, Merck Biosciences), cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using random hexamers. GAPDH was used as an invariant control. The primers used for amplification were as follows: GAPDH-F: 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and GAPDH-R: 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′, amplifying a product of 452 bp, STAT3-F: 5′-TGGACCGTCTGGAAAACTGG-3′ and STAT3-R: 5′-ATTTCCGAGACCCTCTGAGG-3′, yielding a product of 372 bp, and ZFP57–8F: 5′-TGGGCACCAACAAATTGTGG-3′ and ZFP57–7R: 5′-ACTGGTGATTAAAGAGGAAGGT-3′, amplifying a 406-bp fragment. PCR conditions for the GAPDH RT-PCR were an initial step at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 28 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 63 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 30 s, followed by a final extension step at 68 °C for 3 min. STAT3 and Zfp-57 RT-PCRs were carried out at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 32 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 3 min. Production of Recombinant ZFP-57 Protein in E. coli—Mouse Zfp-57 cDNA, representing nucleotides 16–1265 of the original protein coding sequence, was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pQE32 (Qiagen) to create an open reading frame containing the N-terminal sequence RGSHHHHHH fused to amino acids 5–421 of the ZFP-57 protein. This construct was transformed into E. coli strain Top 10F′ (Invitrogen). Protein induction and purification of fusion protein were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The production of fusion protein was monitored by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue protein staining or Western blot analyses using a monoclonal antibody directed against the N-terminal sequence RGSHHHHHH of the fusion protein product (43Pogge von Strandmann E. Zoidl C. Nakhei H. Holewa B. Pogge von Strandmann R. Lorenz P. Klein-Hitpass L. Ryffel G.U. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 733-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was purified to homogeneity using Ni-NTA columns (Qiagen) and used for commercial antibody production (Froxfield Farms UK Ltd., Hampshire, UK). For further purification of the antibody, full-length ZFP57 was cloned in-frame into pGEX6P2, and expressed in BL21 at 30 °C after induction with IPTG. The fusion protein was purified on a GST-TRAP column using the AKTA system and the antibody purified by affinity chromatography after coupling the purified fusion protein to a N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated HP column according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The specificity and tissue distribution of the antibody was tested by Western blot analysis as previously described (38Zoidl G. Meier C. Petrasch-Parwez E. Zoidl C. Habbes H.W. Kremer M. Srinivas M. Spray D.C. Dermietzel R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 448-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nerve Transection and Crush—Adult male Wistar rats (180–220 g) were anesthetized and nerve cut and crush performed as described previously (44Kury P. Greiner-Petter R. Cornely C. Jurgens T. Müller H.W. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7586-7595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Müller H.W. Ignatius M.J. Hangen D.H. Shooter E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All experiments were in accordance with German and European Community guidelines on animal experiments. Construction of Eukaryotic Expression and Transient Transfection Vectors—A PCR step was performed to replace amino acids 1–4 of mouse ZFP-57 with the synthetic primer ZFP57-USP3 (5′-GTGAAGCTTGGAAACAGTCTTCCCAGCCATCCAGGACAC-3′) introducing a unique HindIII restriction site into the protein coding region. This placed Zfp-57 in-frame with the pRc/CMV-His6-tagged plasmid and pQE32 (see below). We constructed a similar vector containing Zfp-57 in the antisense orientation. To obtain green fluorescent protein (GFP) constructs for the nuclear localization experiments sequences coding for full-length ZFP-57 wild-type and mutant forms were amplified from a mouse Zfp-57 full-length cDNA clone using Pfu polymerase. Mutant ZFP-57 forms were ZFP-57Δ142–190, where zinc fingers 2 and 3 are deleted, ZFP-57Δ136–286, where zinc fingers 2, 3, and 4 are missing, and ZFP-57Δ1–86, where the N terminus of the protein is absent (Fig. 2C). The fragments were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted in-frame upstream of the GFP gene in the pEGFP-N3 vector (BD Clontech UK, Basingstoke, UK). All constructs were verified by sequencing. The PCR primers used to obtain the full-length Zfp-57 construct (Zfp-57wt-GFP) were F1 5′-GGAATTCGCCACCATGGCAGCTAGGAAACAGTCTTCC-3′ and R1 5′-TTGGATCCGTCCGAATCTTCTTCTGTCAC-3′. Mutants Zfp-57Δ142–190 and Zfp-57Δ136–286 were obtained by amplifying the sequences upstream and downstream of the corresponding deletion with primer pairs F1/R2 and F2/R1 in the case of Zfp-57Δ142–190 and F1/R3 and F3/R1 in the case of Zfp-57Δ136–286. In each case, primers R2/F2 and R3/F3 carried complementary sequences at their 5′-ends. To obtain the final sequences, the two PCR products obtained for each construct were used as templates in a final PCR reaction using F1 and R1 as primers. The primer sequences were: F1 and R1 (see above), R2 5′-CTTGTTTTGAAAGAAAGGCCTCTCTCCAC-3′, F2 5′-CCTTTCTTTCAAAACAAGCCAGCAGCTAGC-3′, R3 5′-GTCTGAAACGATGCTGAGCCTTGTAGCC-3′ and F3 5′-GCATCGTTTCAGACGTCAACCCAACCAGC-3′. The Zfp-57Δ1–86 construct was obtained using the PCR primers F4 5′-GGAATTCGCCACCATGGGACCATTCTTTTTCTGTCTGACC-3′ and R1. For the transient transfections in COS-7 cells, DNA coding for the N-terminal sequence of ZFP-57 (amino acids 2–91) or for the C-terminal sequence lacking the KRAB domain Δ1–91 (amino acids 92–421) was cloned in-frame downstream from the GAL4 DBD (amino acids 1–147) in pBXG-1, as a BamHI/XbaI fragment. Each fragment was obtained by PCR using Pfu polymerase and the primers F5 5′-AAGGATCCGCAGCTAGGAAACAGTCTTCCCAGC-3′ and R5 5′-GATCTAGAGAAAAAGAATGGTCCACCTTTGAATACC-3′; or F6 5′-AAGGATCCTGTCTGACCTGTGGCAAATGTTTC-3′ and R6 5′-GATCTAGATCAGTCCGAATCTTCTTCTGTCAC-3′ and verified by sequencing. Other plasmids used were pG4MpolyII, containing amino acids 1–148 of the GAL4 DBD, GAL4-ERE-tk-CAT, a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter construct containing two GAL4 binding sites and an estrogen receptor (ER) element in front of a thymidine kinase promoter-CAT fusion, and VP16-ER(C), a chimeric activator with the DBD of ERα and the activation region of VP16 (amino acids 411–490). These constructs have already been described (46Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.-M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). pG4MpolyII-hsKOX1 (amino acids 1–119) was used as a control for repression (30Abrink M. Ortiz J.A. Mark C. Sanchez C.

Biol. 1998; 65: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The plasmid pC-H110 (Amersham Biosciences) carrying the lacZ gene was used in all the transfections. To confirm protein expression of the GAL4 fusion constructs, Western blotting was performed as described previously (20Parkinson D.B. Bhaskaran A. Droggiti A. Dickinson S. D'Antonio M. Mirsky R. Jessen K.R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), using an antibody recognizing the GAL4 DNA binding domain (clone 2GV-3, Euromedex.com, Mundolsheim, France). Plasmid constructs pX9.0MBPLuc, pXP0Luc, and pXPGKLuc containing 9.0 kb of the myelin basic protein (MBP) promoter and 1.1 kb of the P0 promoter were generated as described previously and used in the transient transfection and promoter analysis (see below). 2C.

The 0.5-kb fragment of the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter was derived from a mouse PGK genomic clone C128, a gift from Dr. Antonello Mallamaci.

https://openalex.org/W2153347816,"The cytochrome bound to the photosynthetic reaction center of Rhodovulum sulfidophilum presents two unusual characteristics with respect to the well characterized tetraheme cytochromes. This cytochrome contains only three hemes because it lacks the peptide motif CXXCH, which binds the most distal fourth heme. In addition, we show that the sixth axial ligand of the third heme is a cysteine (Cys-148) instead of the usual methionine ligand. This ligand exchange results in a very low midpoint potential (–160 ± 10 mV). The influence of the unusual cysteine ligand on the midpoint potential of this distal heme was further investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. The midpoint potential of this heme is upshifted to +310 mV when cysteine 148 is replaced by methionine, in agreement with the typical redox properties of a His/Met coordinated heme. Because of the large increase in the midpoint potential of the distal heme in the mutant, both the native and modified high potential hemes are photooxidized at a redox poise where only the former is photooxidizable in the wild type. The relative orientation of the three hemes, determined by EPR measurements, is shown different from tetraheme cytochromes. The evolutionary basis of the concomitant loss of the fourth heme and the down-conversion of the third heme is discussed in light of phylogenetic relationships of the Rhodovulum species triheme cytochromes to other reaction center-associated tetraheme cytochromes.

The evolutionary basis of the concomitant loss of the fourth heme and the down-conversion of the third heme is discussed in light of phylogenetic relationships of the Rhodovulum species triheme cytochromes to other reaction center-associated tetraheme cytochromes. In photosynthetic organisms, the first step in the conversion of light energy into chemical energy occurs in the reaction center (RC). 1The abbreviations used are: RC, reaction center; LH, light harvesting; WT, wild type; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. Upon absorption of a photon by the RC, an electron is transferred from a primary electron donor, located on the periplasmic side of the membrane, to an acceptor on the cytoplasmic side. In purple photosynthetic bacteria the primary electron donor is a bacteriochlorophyll dimer (P), and the electron acceptor a quinone molecule (QA). This light-induced charge separation at the level of the RC initiates a cyclic electron transfer, which leads to the formation of a transmembrane proton-motive force ultimately used for ATP synthesis. In most photosynthetic bacteria, a tetraheme cytochrome c operates as secondary electron donor to the photooxidized primary donor (for a review, see Ref. 1Nitschke W. Dracheva S.M. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands; Boston, London1995: 775-805Google Scholar). Three-dimensional high-resolution structures of the RC and its associated cytochrome subunit have been determined for Blastochloris (formerly Rhodopseudomonas) viridis (2Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Miki K. Huber R. Michel H. Nature. 1985; 318: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (2574) Google Scholar) and Thermochromatium tepidum (3Nogi T. Fathir I. Kobayashi M. Nozawa T. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13561-13566Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the case of B. viridis, the four hemes are arranged linearly and are labeled, starting from P, heme 1(III), heme 2(IV), heme 3(II), and heme 4(I). 2According to Ref. 1Nitschke W. Dracheva S.M. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands; Boston, London1995: 775-805Google Scholar, roman numerals are used to denote the position of the heme binding motifs in the amino acid sequence starting from the N-terminal, and Arabic numerals indicate the structural position relatively to the primary electron donor of the RC. For the sake of comparison with typical tetraheme subunits, the numbering of hemes as introduced for the tetraheme proteins is maintained; heme 4(I) correspondingly does not exist in the triheme cytochrome of R. sulfidophilum. The spatial arrangement of the four hemes presents a high-low-high-low sequence in terms of redox potential (4Verméglio A. Richaud P. Breton J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 259-263Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 5Nitschke W. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3161-3168Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Alegria G. Dutton P.L. Biochim.

This does not impede rapid electron transfer from the distal hemes to P+. Nevertheless, function of the alternating arrangement of the midpoint potentials remains elusive. The fast kinetics of electron transfer, from the tetraheme cytochrome to P+ were extensively studied in B. viridis (8Ortega J.M. Mathis P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1141-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The highest potential heme 1(III), which is closest to P, equilibrates with P+ within 100 to 200 ns. The complete re-reduction of P+ is then limited by the interheme electron transfer between heme 3(II) and heme 1(III) (2-μs half-time). All of these works contributed to give reliable outlines of tetraheme cytochromes bound to the RC. Recently, Masuda and co-workers (9Masuda S. Yoshida M. Nagashima K.V. Shimada K. Matsuura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10795-10801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) discovered in Rhodovulum (R.) sulfidophilum a new type of RC-bound cytochrome. Its amino acid sequence, deduced from the pufC gene, contains only three possible Cys-X-X-Cys-His heme-binding motifs as the binding motif of heme 4(I) is absent. In addition, the sequence analysis suggested that the distal residue responsible for the axial coordination of heme 3(II) (usually methionine) was possibly replaced by a cysteine. In the present work we have coupled site-directed mutagenesis to biophysical measurements to characterize the unusual triheme RC-bound cytochrome of R. sulfidophilum. Relative orientations, redox midpoint potentials, and fast interheme electron transfer have been determined for the WT and a mutant of the axial ligand of heme 3(II). The redox arrangement of the hemes was found to be high-low-(ultra) low in R. sulfidophilum, at variance with the accepted high-low-high-low sequence in the tetraheme cytochromes. These features provide a new case for the understanding of long range electron transfer and the evolution of multicenter redox proteins. Bacterial Growth, Membrane Preparation, and Isolation of RC-LH1 Complexes—R. sulfidophilum cells were grown for 24 h, in Hutner medium supplemented with 0.3 m NaCl under continuous illumination in anaerobic conditions. The growth medium was supplemented with 50 μgml–1 streptomycin in the case of the C148M mutant. For membrane preparations, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min, re-suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7), and disrupted by a French press at 50 megapascal. The unbroken cells were separated from the membrane supernatant by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The membrane fragments were spun down at 250,000 × g for 90 min and re-suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl (pH 7). For RC-LH1 complex purification, the membranes were solubilized by addition of 0.5% Triton X-100. This suspension was loaded on a continuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 200,000 × g overnight. RC-LH1 complexes were collected at the bottom of the gradient (0.3–0.9 m), concentrated using Microcon centrifugal filters (30 kDa), and re-suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl (pH 7), 0.05% Triton X-100 for redox titrations, or in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7), 0.05% Triton X-100 for EPR experiments. Construction of Plasmids and Site-specific Mutagenesis—The whole puf operon, containing genes coding for the L, M, and C (cytochrome) subunits of the RC complex and the α and β subunits of the light-harvesting complex of R. sulfidophilum was cloned (9Masuda S. Yoshida M. Nagashima K.V. Shimada K. Matsuura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10795-10801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The NaeI-SphI fragment containing the 3′-region of pufM, the pufC gene, and the 5′-region of open reading frame 641 was cut out and inserted into plasmid pUC118 at the SmaI-SphI sites, yielding pRSS113. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed based on the two-stage PCR method (10Wang W. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), using the LAPCR in vitro mutagenesis kit (Takara). To replace the 148th cysteine residue of the cytochrome subunit with a methionine residue, the following oligonucleotide was used: 5′-GATCACCAAGAACATGATCGAGGCGACCC-3′ (the corresponding methionine codon is underlined). The plasmid containing mutations on the pufC gene was named pSCC148M. This plasmid and pRSS113 containing the wild type pufC gene were ligated with Kmr-suicide vector pJP5603 (11Penfold R.J. Pemberton J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 145-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) at the EcoRI site and transferred into the cells of strain PUFC1 of R. sulfidophilum, in which the 0.4-kb region flanked by SalI restriction sites in the pufC gene was replaced by the 2.0-kb Smr/SprΩ cassette (12Prentki P. Kirsch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). The mobilizing strain S17-1 (13Simon R. Priefer U. Puhler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 37-45Crossref Scopus (5643) Google Scholar) was used for this conjugal transfer of the plasmid. KmrSmr cells of R. sulfidophilum were selected as single crossover candidates. The insertion of the plasmid into the genomic DNA by a single crossover recombination was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the pufC gene amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of the mutant strains. The mutant, in which the 148th cysteine of the triheme cytochrome subunit was replaced by a methionine, was designated C148M. The strain in which the wild pufC gene was incorporated into the genomic DNA by a single crossover recombination was denoted cis-WT. EPR Spectroscopy—Membrane fragments, resuspended in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7), were oxidized by addition of 2 mm potassium ferricyanide. The membranes were then spun down and re-suspended in 20 mm EDTA (pH 7) to remove manganese and ferricyanide. After renewed pelleting, the membrane fragments were re-suspended in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7). EPR spectra were taken on a Bruker ER 300 X-band spectrometer fitted with an Oxford Instruments helium cryostat and temperature control system. The instrument settings were: temperature, 15 K; microwave power, 6.7 mW; microwave frequency, 9.43 GHz; modulation amplitude, 2.5 millitesla. For the study of angular dependence of EPR signals, oriented multilayer membranes were obtained by drying the membrane fragments on Mylar sheets in a 90% humidity atmosphere for ∼24 h in the dark at 4 °C (14Rutherford A.W. Sétif P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1100: 128-132Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Redox Titrations—The redox titrations of the isolated RC-LH1 complexes, re-suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7), 100 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, were performed with an anaerobic spectroelectrochemical cell (100 μm thick) adapted to a high sensitivity xenon flash-lamp spectrophotometer previously described in Ref. 15Joliot P. Béal D. Frilley B. J. Chim. Physique. 1980; 77: 209-216Crossref Google Scholar. To eliminate the broad-band spectral contribution of the mediators (methyl viologen and benzyl viologen), the cytochrome changes were estimated with respect to a baseline drawn between 548 and 562 nm. The working electrode (gold grid, InterNet Inc.) was modified by 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (Sigma). The following redox mediators were used at a concentration of 100 μm each (Em (midpoint redox potential) indicated): potassium ferricyanide (III) (+430 mV), 1,1′-dimethylferrocene (+340 mV), tetrachloro-1,2-benzoquinone (+280 mV), hexaamineruthenium (II) chloride (+195 mV), 1,2-naphthoquinone (+145 mV), trimethylhydroquinone (+100 mV), 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (menadione) (0 mV), 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (–145 mV), anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid (–225 mV), benzyl viologen dichloride (–350 mV), and methyl viologen dichloride hydrate (–440 mV). Fast Optical Absorption Spectroscopy—Electron transfer rates between the cytochrome subunit and the primary electron donor of the R. sulfidophilum RC were investigated by fast optical time resolved spectroscopy. A laboratory built laser-based spectrophotometer (16Béal D. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1999; 70: 202-207Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was used to monitor absorbance changes in the nanosecond to second time range. Amino Acid Sequence of the Trihemes and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The R. sulfidophilum puf operon encompasses pufB, pufA, pufL, pufM, and pufC in this order from the 5′-upstream region. Site-directed mutation of the pufC gene, C148M, was introduced through a single crossover recombination between the genomic DNA of strain PUFC1 (pufC deletion mutant (9Masuda S. Yoshida M. Nagashima K.V. Shimada K. Matsuura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10795-10801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) and the pUC118-based pSCC148M plasmid (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1). The single crossover recombination was expected to occur between the NaeI site of pufM and the SalI site of pufC. The gene recombination on the genomic DNA of the mutant was confirmed by PCR using primers annealing to the 3′-region of pufL (L530F) and the middle region of pufC (C500R). In strain PUFC1, the middle region of pufC was disrupted by replacement with the Smr/SprΩ cassette. 1.8-kb bands were detected in reactions using template DNAs from the wild type, cis-wild type, and C148M mutant, indicating that the plasmids were successfully introduced. The Cys to Met mutation was confirmed by sequencing the amplified 1.8-kb DNA fragments. An additional unexpected mutation was also found in the C148M mutant: the 854th A was changed to G in the nucleotide sequence, inducing the change of Asp-285 into Gly. Such a mutation is probably because of a misrecognition between A and G by the Taq polymerase used for PCR. At pH 7, Asp-285, the 7th residue following the CXXCH binding motif of heme 1(III), is probably deprotonated and negatively charged. The replacement of this negatively charged amino acid by another one with a null net charge is expected to render the environment of the proximal heme more positive than in the WT. However, as shown below, this additional mutation does not interfere with the effects of the Cys-148 to Met mutation on heme 3(II). Identification of Paramagnetic Species Arising from the RC-associated Cytochrome in the Wild Type and C148M Mutant— The EPR spectrum in Fig. 2, top, was recorded on oxidized RC-LH1 complexes purified from the wild type strain of R. sulfidophilum. EPR signals because of low spin heme compounds are seen at g = 3.12, 2.95, 2.63, 2.47 (gz peaks), 2.26 (gy line), and 1.79 (gx trough). Both the 2.63 and 2.47 gz peaks are far outside the range of field positions typically found for low spin hemes with His/His or His/Met ligation. The gz peak at 2.47 was completely absent in the spectrum of oxidized membrane fragments (Fig. 2) and represented only a very minor component in the spectra recorded on dehydrated, partially ordered membranes (Fig. 3). This signal is probably because of a denatured form of one of the other hemes, most probably the g = 2.63 species (see “Discussion”).Fig. 3Orientation of low spin heme components as determined by EPR.Panel A shows representative spectra recorded on ordered multilayers of wild type (dotted lines) and mutant (continuous lines) membranes at orientations of 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of the magnetic field direction with respect to the plane of the membrane. Panels B and C contain polar plot evaluations of signal amplitudes at g values identified as representing hemes of the RC-associated cytochrome in wild type (B) and in the C148M mutant (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to the EPR species detected in the isolated RC-LH1 complexes, the spectra obtained on membrane fragments featured additional gz peaks at higher g values (Fig. 2, spectra labeled WT mbs). The comparison of spectra taken on purified cytochrome bc1 complex (17Montoya G. te Kaat K. Rodgers S. Nitschke W. Sinning I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) indicated that the large majority of these additional heme species can be attributed to this enzyme (Fig. 2, bottom spectra). From the oxidized-minus-ascorbate-reduced difference spectrum (Fig. 2), only the cytochrome c1 and g = 2.95 hemes are reducible by ascorbate. Replacement of cysteine 148 by methionine in the C148M mutant resulted in conspicuous spectral changes (Fig. 2, spectra labeled C148M mbs). (i) The gz = 2.63, gy = 2.26, and gx = 1.79 signals were absent in the mutant, demonstrating that these spectral parameters in the wild type corresponded to the heme ligated by Cys-148. (ii) Additional signal intensity was present in the region of g = 3.1 to 3.2 in the C148M mutant. The field position of this heme is consistent with His/Met or His/His ligation. (iii) The redox difference spectrum demonstrates that the modified heme is reducible by ascorbate. Orientation of the Three Hemes in the Wild Type and C148M Mutant—Fig. 3A shows representative spectra from partially oriented membrane multilayers (14Rutherford A.W. Sétif P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1100: 128-132Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) of the WT and C148M mutant, as well as difference spectra (mutant minus wild type) highlighting the low spin heme species resulting from the cysteine to methionine ligand change. In line with the results on unoriented membranes shown above, additional signal amplitude in the g = 3.1 to 2.3 region was observed in the mutant. The difference spectra show that the heme modified by the mutation has its gz peak at 2.15 (Fig. 3A, bottom spectrum). Polar plots of signal amplitudes for the three heme species attributed to the RC-associated cytochrome in wild type membranes are shown in Fig. 3B. For the g = 2.63 heme only, all three principal tensor axes could be observed. Because the gz direction is close to the heme normal (18Mailer C. Taylor C.P. Can. J. Biochem. 1972; 50: 1048-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), knowledge of the inclination of gz to the membrane plane is sufficient for deducing at which angle a given heme lies with respect to the membrane. The heme species having gz at 3.12, 2.95, and 2.63 were thereby found to lie at angles of 90°, 60°, and 35° with respect to the plane of the membrane. The polar plot depicted in Fig. 3C represents the peak of the mutation-modified heme at g = 3.16. The orientations of the gz directions in the g = 3.16 heme and in the corresponding heme in the wild type membranes are similar within the precision of the experiment (cf. Fig. 3B, right polar plot and C), indicating that no major conformational changes has occurred. Redox Titrations in Isolated RC-LH1 Complexes—In a first set of experiments, the redox midpoint potentials of both the primary electron donor P and the photooxidizable heme(s) were determined. The light-induced absorbance changes of P+/P were measured at 610 nm, 50 μs after the actinic flash, as a function of the imposed redox potential in isolated RC-LH1 complexes (Fig. 4A). When one heme of the bound cytochrome is reduced prior to the flash, electron transfer to P+ is faster than 50 μs (see below). The absorbance change at 50 μs will then display two waves in the redox titration: the high potential one corresponds to the titration of P+/P proper, and the low-potential one is indicative of the cytochrome+/cytochrome redox potential. For both the WT and the C148M mutant, the photooxidation of P titrates at an apparent midpoint potential (Em) of +450 mV. At lower ambient potential (Eh) the signal disappears because of the fast re-reduction of P+ by the bound cytochrome. The Em of the photooxidizable high potential heme(s) of the triheme cytochrome are thus found equal to +245 and +310 mV for the WT and C148M mutant, respectively. Similar information was obtained by monitoring directly the absorbance changes indicative of the flash-induced cytochrome oxidation (not shown). At potentials lower than –200 mV no heme photooxidation is observed because of the reduction of the primary electron acceptor, with Em of –150 mV (not shown). To determine the Em of other hemes of the RC-bound triheme of R. sulfidophilum, dark redox titrations were performed in the α-band of cytochromes in purified RC-LH1 complexes. 3Accurate redox titrations of the triheme cytochrome cannot be performed on membranes, because of the presence of a large amount of cytochrome bc1 complex (19Yoshida M. Masuda S. Nagashima K.V. Verméglio A. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1506: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For the WT (Fig. 4B, circles) the data are best fitted with 3 one-electron Nernst curves of nearly equal amplitude. The Em of these components are +265, +30, and –160 mV. The +265 mV value determined for the highest potential heme is in good agreement with the Em derived from the photooxidation experiments (+245 mV, see Fig. 4A). Difference absorption spectra for each of the three different WT hemes peak between 552 and 554 nm in the α-band (Fig. 4C). When the ligand Cys is replaced by a Met (C148M mutant), the best fit is obtained with two Nernst curves with Em equal to +85 and +310 mV (Fig. 4B, squares). This high potential is in agreement with the value determined for the photooxidizable heme in the C148M mutant (Fig. 4A). The 2-fold increase of the amplitude of the high potential wave suggests that two hemes of similar midpoint potentials contribute to this component (Fig. 4B, squares). The shift by about 50 mV of Em = +30 mV and Em = +265 mV in the WT to Em = +85 mV and Em = +310 mV may tentatively be ascribed to the second mutation (Asp-285 into Gly), which was revealed by sequencing. Photooxidation of Heme(s) in Isolated RC-LH1 Complexes— According to the above midpoint potential determination and assignment, one expects that, at moderate ambient redox potential, only one heme would be photooxidizable in the WT, whereas photooxidation of two hemes would occur in the C148M mutant because of the upshift of 450 mV for the modified heme. We thus monitored absorbance changes induced by a series of flashes using ascorbate-reduced isolated RC-LH1 complexes, ensuring reduction of both the primary donor and the high potential heme(s) in the dark. The redox states of P and HP heme(s) were measured at 610 and 424 nm, respectively, following a sequence of saturating flashes generated 1.5 s apart (Fig. 5). For the WT (panel A), a large amount of the photooxidized P+ is rapidly re-reduced after the first flash by a high potential heme as shown by the small 610-nm change at 50 μs and the negative signal observed at 424 nm because of cytochrome photooxidation. After the second and subsequent flashes, the formation of P+ is observed, whereas no further cytochrome photooxidation occurs. This result is in line with redox data. At variance, in the C148M mutant (panel B), two hemes can be photooxidized by a series of saturating flashes as the system reaches a steady state regime from the second flash onwards. This result is again in accordance with the redox titrations described above, showing a recovery of the usual behavior of tetraheme RC-bound cytochromes, which contain, like C148M, two His/Met-coordinated high potential hemes. UV-visible absorption changes linked to photooxidation of the WT high potential heme are presented in Fig. 5C (upper trace). The α-band is centered at 554 nm, in accordance with redox titration (Fig. 4C). In the case of the C148M mutant (Fig. 5C, lower traces), the absorption changes induced by the first and second excitation flash are very similar, however, peaking at a lower wavelength, lying between 552 and 554 nm, revealing the participation of the additional mutated heme. Fast Kinetics of Inter-heme Electron Transfer—Flash-induced absorbance changes were measured with nanosecond time resolution in the Qx band of the primary electron donor P (610 nm, see Fig. 6) or in the α-band of cytochromes (Fig. 7) to determine the intramolecular electron transfer properties of both the WT and C148M mutant under ascorbate-reduced conditions.Fig. 7Flash-induced absorbance changes recorded in the α-band of cytochromes on ascorbate-reduced membranes fragments of R. sulfidophilum WT (left panel) or C148M (right panel). High potential heme(s) were reduced by addition of 100 μm ascorbate. A global fit analysis of the data was performed according to a monophasic exponential decay for the wild type or to a biphasic decay for the C148M mutant. The spectra of the relative components are drawn as a dashed line (WT) or dot-dashed and solid lines (C148M).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the case of the WT, the reduction of the photooxidized primary donor is essentially monophasic, with 90% of P+ being reduced with a half-time of 1.6 μs. 10% of P+ remains oxidized in the >10-μs range in agreement with the experiment shown in Fig. 5A. In contrast, for the C148M mutant, the re-reduction of P+ is complete and biphasic: the 1.8-μs half-time fast phase accounts for 60% of the amplitude, whereas 40% of the P+ decays with t½ = 11 μs. Fig. 7 describes the light-induced absorbance changes in the α-band of cytochromes detected at various times after flash excitation. For both the WT (upper panel) and C148M mutant (lower panel), the signal detected at 100 ns is due to P+, and to the carotenoid band shift caused by the photo-induced membrane potential. In the case of the WT, a trough centered at 555 nm develops from 500 ns to 5 μs with a half-time of 1.5 μs in agreement with the kinetics observed for P+ decay. In the C148M mutant, in the 100-ns to 5-μs time range, the trough wavelength is centered at 555 nm, as for the WT, while at longer times, a gradual shift toward shorter wavelengths is observed. A global fit analysis of the data with a biexponential decay revealed two phases of cytochrome oxidation: a fast component of t½ = 2.1 μs (dot-dashed line) and a slower phase of t½ = 8.7 μs (solid line), in fair agreement with that measured for the P+ reduction (Fig. 6, squares). This shows that the oxidation is shared between two hemes absorbing at 553 and 555 nm, respectively, in line with the presence of two hemes of midpoint potentials around 310 mV obtained in the dark titration. Correlation of Redox/Spectral Species to Hemes Bound by the Three Binding Motifs in the Amino Acid Sequence—Three distinct redox and EPR species could be attributed to the hemes of the R. sulfidophilum RC-associated triheme cytochrome. The wiping of the gz = 2.63 spectrum and the concomitant appearance of the gz = 3.16 spectral species induced by the Cys-148 to Met mutation unambiguously identified these paramagnetic centers as arising from heme 3(II). The loss of the –160 mV titration wave in the mutant identifies this redox species as belonging to the heme 3(II) in agreement with the EPR observation that this heme is not reducible by ascorbate and in line with redox properties of His/Cys-ligated hemes (see below). A second low potential species (Em =+ 30 mV, gz = 3.12) was detected in the WT. In typical purple bacterial tetraheme cytochromes, heme 2(IV) has a His/His ligation pattern and consequently displays a low redox potential. The conservation of the axial ligands in the sequence of the R. sulfidophilum triheme cytochrome (9Masuda S. Yoshida M. Nagashima K.V. Shimada K. Matsuura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10795-10801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggests that this heme has a similarly low Em value also in the triheme cytochrome. The +30 mV, g = 3.12 heme is therefore attributed to heme 2(IV"

The aims of the present study were to examine the affinity of fibronectin type III repeats of TN-C fragments (TNIII) for heparin, to investigate the role of the TNIII4 domains in the binding of TN-C to heparin, and to delineate a sequence of amino acids within the TNIII4 domain, which mediates cooperative heparin binding. At a physiological salt concentration, and pH 7.4, TNIII3–5 binds to heparin with high affinity (KD = 30 nm). However, a major heparin-binding site in TNIII5 produces a modest affinity binding at a KD near 4 μm, and a second site in TNIII4 enhances the binding by several orders of magnitude, although it was far too weak to produce an observable binding of TNIII4 by itself. Moreover, mutagenesis of the KEDK sequence in the TNIII4 domain resulted in the significant reduction of heparin-binding affinity. In addition, residues in the KEDK sequences are conserved in TN-C throughout mammalian evolution. Thus the structure-based sequence alignment, mutagenesis, and sequence conservation data together reveal a KEDK sequence in TNIII4 suggestive of a minor heparin-binding site. Finally, we demonstrate that TNIII4 contains binding sites for heparin sulfate proteoglycan and enhances the heparin sulfate proteoglycan-dependent human gingival fibroblast adhesion to TNIII5, thus providing the biological significance of heparin-binding site of TNIII4. These results suggest that the heparin-binding sites may traverse TNIII4–5 and thus require KEDK in TNIII4 for optimal heparin-binding.

To understand TN-C function, it is important to identify the specific domains of the protein responsible for binding to glycosaminoglycans. Two heparin-binding sites have been identified in TN-C (27Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Weber P.

Heparin/heparin sulfate binding seems to be a common feature of extracellular matrix molecules, including TN-C. TN-C binds to heparin at physiological salt concentrations, although the affinity of TN-C binding to heparin has not been demonstrated specifically until now (29Marton L.S. Gulcher J.R. Stefansson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13145-13149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to examine more specifically the interaction of TN-C with heparin using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and to delineate the putative heparin-binding site that mediates this interaction. Until today, the characterization of binding sites on heparin that interact with the FNIII domains has largely focused on the TNIII5 domain, although it is not clear whether or not these are the only motifs required for heparin interaction. In this study we investigate the specific role of the TNIII4 domain in heparin binding by characterizing wild-type and mutant TNIII proteins through the use of SPR direct binding studies. Here we present evidences suggesting that the secondary heparin-binding site in TNIII4 contributes to overall TNIII binding to heparin. Materials—Biotinylated heparin (BiHep) was from Sigma. Biosensor BiacoreX and sensor chip CM5 (disposable sensor surface covered with a carboxymethyl dextran layer for protein immobilization) were from Biacore (Uppsala, Sweden). HBS buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.005% surfactant P20), NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide), EDC (N-ethyl-N9-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide), and ethanolamine were from Biacore. Immobilization of Heparin—In these analyses, streptavidin was coupled to a CM5 sensor chip using the amine coupling kit (Biacore) with the procedures specified by the manufacturer. There are two flow cells/sensor chip for the BiacoreX system. The streptavidin was immobilized in the first flow cell (FC-1) to 20,000 resonance units. Bovine serum albumin was immobilized in the second flow cell (FC-2) to 950 resonance units as a negative control for background correction. BiHep was immobilized to the streptavidin-coupled CM5 sensor chip according to supplier's instructions. The flow cell with the sensor surface was kept at 25 °C. Biacore Binding Analysis—Evaluation of kinetic parameters (ka and kd) was performed by using a SPR-based BiacoreX biosensor. To determine the binding kinetics of each TN-C proteins, a series of samples with varied concentrations was injected during the association phase for 5 min (40 μl/min). The dissociation phase was carried out over a period of 10 min. The flow cell could be regenerated with a 3-min injection of 1.0 m NaCl, which removed the TN-C proteins while leaving the heparin intact. The kinetic analysis of sensograms from the interaction of various analytes with the immobilized BiHep was based on the rate equation, dR/dt = kaCRmax - (kaC + kd)Rt, where dR/dt is the rate of change of the SPR signal (resonance units) due to analyte interaction with immobilized BiHep at time t seconds, ka and kd are the association- and dissociation-rate constants, respectively, C is the concentration of analyte and Rmax is the maximum analyte binding capacity to BiHep in resonance units. Both association- and dissociation-rate constants were determined from the analysis of sensograms using the Biaevaluation software, version 3.0. All binding curves were corrected for background and bulk refractive index contribution by subtraction of the reference flow cells. Models were fitted both globally across the data sets and for a single concentration. Construction of Expression Vectors and Site-directed Mutagenesis— Human TN-C cDNAs were amplified from adult human cDNA by employing standard PCR amplification methods. PCR primers were designed to recognize type III modules (TNIII3–5), TN3 forward primers 5′-AGCCATATGGCTGTTCCTCCTCCCACTGACCTG-3′, TN3 reverse primers 5′-GCCGAATTCATGTTGTGAAGGTCTC-3′, TN4 reverse primers 5′-GGAATTCCTCACTTGGGCGTGTCCAAC-3′, and TN5 reverse primers 5′-TCGAATTCTATGTTCGGTAATTAAT-3′. PCR-amplified cDNA products were digested with KpnI and EcoRI, separated using a PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), and ligated into the pBADHisA expression vector (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The following TN-C residues were individually substituted with glutamine: Lys751, Lys754, Lys1057, and Arg1059. All expression constructions and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The recombinant fusion proteins containing a poly-His tag were expressed and purified using a Ni2+ affinity column under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Cell Adhesion Assay—Human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) were cultured in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). HGFs were serum-starved for 24 h, harvested by 0.02% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA, resuspended in α-minimal essential medium, washed three times with α-minimal essential medium containing 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 1% bovine serum albumin, and plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in α-minimal essential medium. Twenty-four-well plates were coated with recombinant proteins overnight at 4 °C and then blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. Suspensions of control cells were maintained in bovine serum albumin-coated plates for the indicated time. After 60 min at 37 °C adherent cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), and stained with 0.25% (w/v) crystal violet (Sigma) in 2% (v/v) ethanol/water. After extensive washings with distilled water, plates were allowed to dry. The absorbance was read and measured at 570 nm, and nonspecific adhesion was determined in wells coated with 1% bovine serum albumin as negative control. Kinetic Study of TNIII Domains—To assess the respective participation of the various reported TN-C heparin-binding domains in its interaction with heparin, we prepared a series of recombinant fragments of human TN-C spanning FNIII (TNIII) domains expressed in bacteria. The recombinant TN-C fragments were expressed as His-tagged fusion proteins at the COOH terminus to provide convenient purification. In addition, five neighboring amino acids were included to facilitate protein folding. Recombinant TNIII domains were purified near homogeneity with metal affinity resin as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1). Direct binding studies using SPR-based Biacore technology were performed. In TN-C, TNIII domain 5 was identified as a major heparin-binding region using isolated recombinant domains described previously (28Weber P. Zimmermann D.R. Winterhalter K.H. Vaughan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4619-4623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In agreement with the previous results, our direct binding studies using SPR-based Biacore technology clearly demonstrated that the TNIII5 was the major heparin-binding domain. The kd for recombinant TNIII3–5 and TNIII4–5 exhibited a very high affinity for heparin under physiological conditions (30 and 40 nm for TNIII3–5 and TNIII4–5, respectively) using BiHep immobilized to the streptavidin-coupled CM5 sensor chip (Fig. 2). As shown in Table I, both TNIII3–5 and TNIII4–5 exhibited a fast association rate with heparin (ka TNIII3–5, 8.64 × 103 × m-1s-1; ka TNIII4–5, 4.46 × 103 × m-1s-1) biosensor surfaces. The resultant complexes between TN-C-heparin were stable as illustrated by slow dissociation rates (kd TNIII3–5, 0.29 × 10-3 × s-1; kdTNIII4–5, 0.2 × 10-3 × s-1).Table IResults of the Biacore binding studies with immobilized heparin and tenascin-C The association rate (ka), dissociation rate (kd), and the dissociation constant (KD) are shown.

However, both TN3 and TN4 bind heparin biosensor surfaces so poorly that association and dissociation kinetics could not be quantitated (Table I). An important new finding in the present study is that the heparin binding of an expression protein containing only the TNIII5 domain was always much weaker than the binding of TNIII3–5 or TNIII4–5, suggesting that the TNIII4 domain contributes significantly to complete heparin binding. How can the TNIII4 domain enhance the binding for heparin? The most likely explanation lies in the nature of cooperative binding. TNIII5 containing the primary heparin-binding site alone produces a modest affinity binding at a KD near 4 μm; a second site in TNIII4 could enhance the binding by several orders of magnitude, even if it were far too weak to produce an observable binding of TNIII4 by itself. Sequence Alignment and Analysis—NMR and crystal structures reveal that the RGD sequence of FIII10 resides in a loop extending from the domain surface (30Sharma A. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Grant R.P. Spitzfaden C. Altroff H. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6159-6166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The structure-based sequence alignment indicates that the TNIII3–5 domains share the same overall structure, with functional fragments occupying surface loops (Fig. 3A). It is notable that the loop regions of the alignment most often contain hydrophilic amino acids, because they are positioned on the surface of the protein. The sequence KGRHKSKPARVK in TNIII5 has been implicated in heparin binding activity previously (28Weber P. Zimmermann D.R. Winterhalter K.H. Vaughan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4619-4623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These six positively charged residues (contributed from a loop between F and G strands) project into the solvent. Thus, we focused on the loop regions in TNIII4 for a potential role in binding to heparin. With the above information taken collectively, the KEDK (amino acids 751–754) sequence possesses a predominantly positive surface charge that makes its relevance as a potential heparin-binding site very likely. Moreover, the KEDK loop on the fourth domain of TN-C has a similar high sequence conservation between different species ranging from chick, mouse, pig, and human (Fig. 3B). To further investigate the heparin binding activity of the KEDK sequence, we decided to produce recombinant TNIII3–5 proteins bearing double mutations replacing basic residues Lys751 and Lys754 by Gln. KEDK Residues in TNIII4 Contribute to Heparin Binding Activity of TNIII5—The heparin binding activity of TNIII4–5 mutants was assessed by SPR-based Biacore technology. The heparin binding activity of the TNIII4–5 mutants in the putative heparin-binding sites was compared with the TNIII4–5 wild-type protein. The results from SPR-based Biacore are summarized in Table II. The KD for recombinant TNIII4–5 K751Q/K754Q exhibited a reduced affinity (KD = 29.2 μm) for heparin compared with TNIII4–5 (70-fold). As expected, mutations of the KGR sequence in the TNIII5 domain, TNIII4–5 K1057Q and TNIII4–5 R1059Q, result in complete inhibition of heparin binding (Table II). Based on these data, we conclude that the TNIII5 domain is the primary heparin-binding site, and residues at Arg1059 and Lys1057 in this domain are of critical importance in the interaction. The fact that mutations of the KEDK sequence in the TNIII4 domain reduced affinity for heparin strongly indicates that the complete heparin binding in TN-C relies on secondary heparin binding formed by KEDK residues. These results suggest that the KEDK residues in the loop region between F and G strands contribute to an optimal heparin binding activity of TN-C, and heparin-binding sites in TN-C may span both of the TNIII4 and TNIII5 domains.Table IIBiacore binding studies with immobilized heparin and tenascin-C mutantsAnalytekdkaKDs-1 × 10-3m-1 s-1 × 103μmK751Q/K754Q (KEDK)0.011.3829.2K1057Q (KGR)NBaNB, no bindingNBNBR1059Q (KGR)NBNBNBa NB, no binding Open table in a new tab Role of Heparin-binding Domain of TNIII4 in Cell Adhesion—To investigate the biological significance of the heparin-binding domain of TNIII4, we explored whether a heparin-binding property was relevant to the process of cell adhesion. HGFs were plated on dishes coated with a series of TNIII fragments. When HGF cell adhesion to a TNIII fragment-coated dish was quantitated by the crystal violet staining of fixed cells, TNIII4–5 exhibited significantly higher adhesive activity than TNIII5. Notably, the cell binding to TNIII4–5 K751Q/K754Q was significantly reduced. Moreover, the adhesion of HGF to TNIII4–5 was completely abrogated by the presence of 5 μg/ml heparin in the plating medium. These results suggest that prior occupancy of the heparin-binding sites in TNIII4–5 by soluble heparin might cause interference with its ability to bind to cell surface HSPGs. To test this possibility, cell surface HSPGs were removed from HGF by treatment of the cells with heparinase I, an enzyme that acts on highly sulfated HSPGs (32Feitsma K. Hausser H. Robenek H. Kresse H. Vischer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9396-9402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Heparinase I digestion of HGF cell surfaces reduced the number of TNIII4–5-binding sites by 75%. In control experiments, treatment of HGF with chondroitinase ABC failed to inhibit a TNIII4–5-mediated adhesion of HGF showing that cell surface heparan sulfates, but not chondroitin sulfates, contribute to the cell-adhesive properties of TNIII4–5 (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results support the conclusion that TNIII4 contains binding sites for HSPGs and enhances the adhesive activity of TNIII5 to HSPGs through a cooperative mechanism. In the present study we used SPR-based Biacore technology to define the influence of the KEDK sequence of the TNIII4 domain upon the interaction of TN-C with heparin. In agreement with a previous finding, we observed that the TNIII5 fragment containing a major heparin-binding site binds to heparin under conditions of physiological pH and ionic strength. However, the affinity of TNIII5 alone for heparin is significantly lower than that of fragments containing both TNIII4 and TNIII5 domains. Therefore, the presence of the TNIII4 domain may enhance the heparin-binding affinity of TNIII5 by some cooperative mechanism. The simplest model would postulate two binding sites, one in TNIII4 and another in TNIII5, which can bind simultaneously to heparin. It is of interest to note that the cooperative contribution of the adjacent FNIII repeat(s) is often found in maximum heparin binding. A similar example of this cooperative heparin-binding with the adjacent FNIII repeat can be seen with the primary heparin-binding site in the 13th type III repeat of fibronectin (FNIII13) and a putative minor site ∼60 Å away in the 14th type III repeat of fibronectin (FNIII14) (30Sharma A. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An additional similar example comes from the two contiguous heparin-binding sites in the 10th and 11th type III repeat of tenascin-X (TN-X) (33Lethias C. Elefteriou F. Parsiegla G. Exposito J.Y. Garrone R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16432-16438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The overall architecture of FNIII repeat molecules may adopt a variety of shapes depending on the tilted angles of inter-repeats and the length of these inter-repeat regions. The previous study (7Leahy D.J. Hendrickson W.A. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Science. 1992; 258: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) proposed that the TNIII4 and TNIII5 repeats are tightly packed resulting in an extended and relatively straight strand. Our analysis of the structure-based sequence alignment of the TNIII repeats and FNIII repeat structure indicates that the sequence KEDK in the loop region between the F and G β-sheets of TNIII4 is on the same face of the molecules as the sequence KGR in the TNIII5, although two TNIII repeats are concatenated in a slight spiral. Interestingly, the heparin-binding site in TN-X has been predicted to reside in this loop region between the F and G β-sheets of the FNIII10 module and a linker region between FNIII10 and FNIII11. However, because of the linker-domain region, TN-X has more a flexible orientation between the FNIII10 and FNIII11, producing a cationic pocket. Heparin-protein interactions are based on ionic contacts between positively charged residues (Arg and Lys) and the negatively charged groups of heparin (sulfate groups of glucosamine or the carboxylate group of iduronic acid) (34Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Residues Lys751 and Lys754 in the TNIII4 domain were found to constitute the minor heparin-binding domain, with a double mutation of K751Q/K754Q resulting in the significant reduction of heparin-binding affinity. In addition, residues in the KEDK sequences are conserved in TN-X between different species ranging from a chick to a human. Thus the structure-based sequence alignment, mutagenesis, and sequence conservation data together suggest that the KEDK sequence in TNIII4 is essential for the high affinity binding to heparin. Because the KEDK sequence in TNIII4 is on the same face of the molecules as the KGR sequence in TNIII5, heparin-binding sites may traverse TNIII4–5 and thus require the residues KEDK from the TNIII4 for optimal heparin binding. The sequence KGRHKSKPARVK in TNIII5 has been implicated in heparin binding activity previously (28Weber P. Zimmermann D.R. Winterhalter K.H. Vaughan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4619-4623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that mutagenesis of Lys1057 and Arg1059 reduces heparin binding drastically. However, other basic residues cannot be excluded for the heparin-binding site. The simplest model would postulate two binding sites, one in TNIII4 and another in TNIII5, which can bind simultaneously to heparin. We have now confirmed that the secondary low affinity heparin-binding site in the TNIII4 domain is conserved ranging in chick, mouse, pig, and human. The conservation of this activity over the 300-million years that separate chickens and humans suggests that it is biologically important for the functioning of TN-C in tissues. Thus, we conclude that the TNIII4 domain contributes to optimal heparin binding and the KEDK sequence in TNIII4 is minor heparin-binding site."

The efficient induction and execution of apoptosis are essential for cell clearance in specific developmental situations. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I is a survival factor for epithelial cells in the mammary gland, and its withdrawal or inhibition leads to apoptosis. In this paper we describe a novel mechanism that may lead to suppression of an IGF-I-mediated signaling pathway through cleavage of insulin receptor substrate (IRS). During the process of forced weaning, when mammary epithelial cells rapidly enter apoptosis in vivo, IRS-1 and IRS-2 disappear. We have used cultured mammary epithelial cells to demonstrate that IRS removal can be mediated through the action of caspase 10. Caspase 10 activation and IRS-1 cleavage are regulated by a MKK1-signaling pathway but not by a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathway nor by the extracellular proapoptotic ligands FasL, tumor necrosis factor-α-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), or transforming growth factor-β3.

In Escherichia coli, the b2δ subunit complex comprises the stator, bound to subunit a in Fo and to the α3β3 hexagon of F1. Previous work has shown that N-terminal residues of α subunit are involved in binding δ. A synthetic peptide consisting of the first 22 residues of α (αN1–22) binds specifically to isolated wild-type δ subunit with 1:1 stoichiometry and high affinity, accounting for a major portion of the binding energy between δ and F1.

We introduced truncations, deletions, and mutations into αN1–22 peptide and examined their effects on binding to the δ subunit. The deletions and mutations were introduced also into the N-terminal region of the uncA (α subunit) gene to determine effects on cell growth in vivo and membrane ATP synthase activity in vitro. Effects seen in the peptides were well correlated with those seen in the uncA gene. The results show that, with the possible exception of residues close to the initial Met, all of the αN1–22 sequence is required for binding of δ to α.

ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation occurs on the enzyme F1Fo-ATP synthase. In Escherichia coli, the enzyme consists of eight different subunit types, in stoichiometry α3β3γδϵab2cn. Proton movement through the membrane sector of the complex, mediated by subunits a and c, is believed to generate rotation of subunits c, ϵ, and γ, which collectively form the “rotor.” In turn, this rotation acts on the catalytic sites, three in number, at α/β interfaces of the alternating α3β3 hexagon, to generate ATP (1Diez M.

Purification of δ Subunit, Purification of F1, Preparation of Membrane Vesicles, Assay of ATPase Activity, Assay of ATP-driven Proton Pumping in Membrane Vesicles, and Growth Yield Assays—These were as described previously (14Weber J.

For assay of membrane ATPase activity, 50 μg of membranes were assayed at 30 °C in 1 ml of assay medium (50 mm Tris-SO4, pH 8.5, 10 mm NaATP, 4 mm MgCl2) for appropriate times (1–2 min for wild type, 10–20 min for mutants with low activity). To assess sensitivity of ATPase to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) inhibition, membranes (1 mg of protein/ml) were preincubated at 30 °C in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DCCD for 30 min. Growth yields on limiting glucose were measured as in Ref. 25Senior A.E. Latchney L.R. Ferguson A.M. Wise J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar. E. coli Strains and uncA Gene Mutagenesis—For generation of deletions plasmid pBWU13.4 (26Ketchum C.J. Al-Shawi M.K. Nakamoto R.K. Biochem.

The reverse primer corresponded to bp +216–235 of uncA. Forward primers began at bp -11 and incorporated the codon deletions required. Amplified fragments were phosphorylated at 3′-ends and cloned into pUC118 pretreated with alkaline phosphatase and cut with SmaI. pUC118 derivatives with inserts containing uncA sequence were identified by digestion with XhoI and ApaLI. Deletions could be readily recognized by fragment size and/or loss of a natural EcoRI site and/or gain of a new restriction site introduced by the PCR primer and were confirmed routinely by DNA sequencing. It was also routinely confirmed that no PCR-generated errors were present between SphI and XhoI sites. The deletions were transferred to pBWU13.4 on SphI-XhoI fragments, and the resultant plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain DK8 (27Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S.A. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for functional studies. Point mutations in the uncA gene were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis following previous methods (14Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) except that the template was M13mp18 containing the SphI-SalI fragment from pBWU13.4. After mutagenesis the point mutations were moved into plasmid pBWU13.4 as above and expressed in strain DK8. Synthetic Peptides—Peptides were purchased from United States Biological (immunological grade). All peptides with the single exception of αN1–22Cam (see “Results”) had free N and C termini. (In intact ATP synthase, the N terminus of α subunit is free Met.) For fluorescence binding assays, the peptides were dissolved at 10 mg/ml in dry Me2SO and used for 1 day only. Me2SO was rendered anhydrous by use of Molecular Sieves (catalog no. M-6141; Sigma). Concentration of Me2SO in the fluorescence binding assays did not exceed 0.75% (v/v). Fluorescence Binding Assays—Tryptophan fluorescence titrations were carried out as described in Ref. 17Weber J. Muharemagic A. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13623-13626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, with individual conditions given in the figure and table legends. Excitation was at 295 nm, and emission was measured at 325 nm. The fluorophore was the single natural Trp in the δ subunit at residue 28. The buffer was 50 mm HEPES/NaOH, 5 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0, at room temperature. A fixed concentration of δ subunit (0.6–3.2 μm) was titrated with peptide, and several concentrations of δ were used with each peptide. A control titration of buffer alone with peptide was always conducted and subtracted, although usually negligible. Binding-induced changes in Trp fluorescence were plotted versus peptide concentration, and from the resulting curves, Kd values were calculated by nonlinear regression following the methods of Eftink (28Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 221-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), using the equation, F=m×(([Eo]/2+[Ltotal]/n/2+Kd/n/2)−(([Eo]/2+[Ltotal]/n/2+Kd/n/2)2−[Eo]×[Ltotal]/n)0.5)(Eq. 1) where F is the measured fluorescence change at fixed δ concentration Eo and added peptide concentration Ltotal, n is the stoichiometry of binding, and m is a factor that converts fluorescence data to ligand bound (equals F at saturation divided by [Eo]). Values of n (stoichiometry of binding of peptide to δ subunit) were consistent with one peptide molecule binding per δ subunit molecule in all cases. Use of Me2SO to Dissolve Peptides—The assay that we use in this work to determine quantitatively the binding of peptides to δ subunit is a fluorescence assay that measures the strong (up to 50%) enhancement of fluorescence of the single natural Trp-28 residue in δ that occurs upon binding of wild-type δ to F1 or to synthetic peptides (14Weber J.

We had previously encountered difficulty due to insolubility of the synthetic peptides in aqueous media at millimolar concentration, as needed to perform fluorescence titrations. For instance, peptide αN1–22Cam (the analog of αN1–22 but with an amidated C terminus) could not be studied (17Weber J. Muharemagic A. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13623-13626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here the same problem arose with several of the deletion or mutation peptides. We found, however, that the majority of peptides dissolved at up to 8 mm in dry Me2SO, and we confirmed that the addition of associated small amounts of Me2SO (≤0.75% v/v) had no effect on the fluorescence titration of αN1–22 with δ. Thus, all peptides were dissolved in Me2SO for fluorescence studies. In fact, it turned out that αN1–22Cam behaved identically to αN1–22 in fluorescence assays and bound to δ with a similar Kd value of 150 nm; thus, the presence of a free or blocked carboxyl at the C terminus of the peptide had no effect. Finding the Optimal Length of Peptide for δ Binding by Incrementally Truncating the C Terminus—Originally (17Weber J. Muharemagic A. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13623-13626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we identified αN1–22 as a suitable peptide that might bind to purified δ, because secondary structure predictions suggested a continuous helix for residues α6–18, proteolysis experiments showed that removal of residues α1–19 prevented δ binding to F1 (20Dunn S.D. Heppel L.A. Fullmer C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6891-6896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in x-ray structures the β-barrel domain at the crown of F1 is seen to commence in α subunits after residue α23 (22Gibbons C.

In the first part of this work, we tested binding of a series of peptides αN1–24, αN1–22, αN1–20, and so on in increments of two-residue truncations, down to αN1–12. Fig. 2 shows the results of typical fluorescence titrations measuring binding of the peptides to purified wild-type δ subunit. Fig. 3 shows similar titrations, but using δV79A mutant purified δ subunit instead of wild type. The mutation δV79A, occurring at the highly conserved hydrophobic residue δ79, is known to impair binding of purified δ subunit to F1 (15Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and to αN1–22 (17Weber J. Muharemagic A. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Therefore, it provides additional evidence as to the specificity of binding.

Here we found a Kd for αN1–22 binding to wild-type δ of 113 nm, slightly lower than the value of 130 nm reported in our previous work (17Weber J. Muharemagic A. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13623-13626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and for binding of αN1–22 to V79A δ we found a Kd of 1.95 μm compared with 2.4 μm in the previous report. Increasing the peptide length by two residues in αN1–24 reduced affinity of binding to wild-type δ by 43-fold. Reduction in length by two residues (αN1–20) also decreased affinity in wild-type δ, by 11-fold. Further reduction in length of the peptide yielded greater decreases in binding affinity, such that neither αN1–14 nor αN1–12 peptides showed measurable binding to wild-type δ subunit. The same general pattern of reduced affinity was seen for the series of peptides binding to V79A mutant δ. It may be noted that binding of the parent αN1–22 peptide to V79A δ is already 17-fold weaker than to wild-type δ. Overall, the data show that for optimal binding to δ, a peptide with a length of 22 residues is required, suggesting that residues located along the entire sequence make interactions with δ. Possibly, the two additional residues in αN1–24 cause formation of novel structure in the peptide or simply interfere with binding to δ by folding back on the rest of the peptide. Testing the Idea That the N-terminal Region of the α Subunit Forms an Amphipathic Helix and That Hydrophobic Residues on One Surface Make Interactions with δ Subunit—Fig. 1C shows a helical wheel diagram of residues α6–α19. A series of hydrophobic residues shown in italic type (Leu-11, Ile-8, Phe-19, Ile-12, and Ile-16) clusters on one surface of the helical wheel. (Arg-15 on this surface may also be viewed as potentially hydrophobic, depending on its orientation). Conversely, the other surface shows mainly polar residues (Ser-9, Lys-13, Thr-6, Glu-10, Gln-14, Glu-7, Gln-18). Given that we had identified helices 1 and 5 of δ as forming the F1-binding surface (15Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and that the NMR structure of δ shows these helices forming a hydrophobic groove (16Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 197-201Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar), it seemed likely that some or all of the hydrophobic residues listed above might make direct interaction with δ. Furthermore, an analysis of sequences of α subunit from multiple species revealed that hydrophobic residues are strongly favored at positions α8, α11, α12, α16, and α19 (data not shown). Initially, we tested binding of peptides containing point mutations at position αIle-8 in αN1–22, namely αN1–22(I8E) and αN1–22(I8K), both containing a charged residue in place of Ile. Fig. 4 shows typical fluorescence titrations with wild-type and V79A mutant δ, and Table I shows the calculated Kd values. The substitutions Glu and Lys for Ile at residue 8 in αN1–22 peptide caused approximately equal losses of binding affinity with either wild-type or V79A mutant δ in the range of 5–8-fold. Therefore, it was clear that residue αIle-8 is important for binding of α to δ. In further work (Table II), we found that when the mutations αI8E and αI8K were incorporated into the uncA (α subunit gene) and expressed in E. coli cells, they caused reduction of growth yield in vivo, indicating loss of ATP synthesis capacity and reduction of ATPase activity and ATP-driven proton pumping in membrane preparations in vitro. The ATPase activity showed somewhat reduced DCCD inhibition. Experiments using NADH to induce proton pumping showed that none of these membrane preparations was leaky to protons (data not shown). In contrast, the mutations αI8A and αI8W (where hydrophobic residues are substituted for αIle-8) had much lesser effects on growth yield, membrane ATPase, and ATP-driven proton pumping (Table II). The results show that a hydrophobic residue is preferred at position α8.Table IIEffects of point mutations at positions αIle-8 and αGlu-7 on ATP synthase function in cells and membrane preparations All data are means of at least quadruplicate determinations, except ATPase values are means of octuplicates.StrainGrowth yieldMembrane ATPase activityaActivity of wild type varied from 4.2 to 5.8 μmol/min/mg membrane protein in different experiments.

Fig. 5 shows fluorescence titrations with these peptides using wild-type δ. The calculated Kd values are given in Table I. Substitution of Glu at any one of these positions impaired binding impressively. Binding affinity was decreased at least 10-fold in all cases. Interestingly, the αN1–22(I16E) peptide brought about a quench of the fluorescence with wild-type δ rather than the usual fluorescence enhancement. Of 23 peptides tested in this and other work, this was the only peptide with this property, suggesting that residue αIle-16 may come very close to residue δTrp-28 when α is bound to δ. We also tested binding of the same series of point mutant peptides to V79A mutant δ (titrations not shown), and resultant calculated Kd values are listed in Table I. A similar pattern of reduction of binding affinity was apparent. It may be noted that a fluorescence quench was again seen when αN1–22(I16E) was titrated with V79A mutant δ; however, the fluorescence changes were too small to permit confident calculation of Kd values.

https://openalex.org/W1994336098,"The functional importance of the N-terminal epidermal growth factor-like domain (EGF-N) of factor X/Xa (FX/Xa) was investigated by constructing an FX mutant in which the exon coding for EGF-N was deleted from FX cDNA. Following expression and purification to homogeneity, the mutant was characterized with respect to its ability to function as a zymogen for either the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex or the factor IXa-factor VIIIa complex and then to function as an enzyme in the prothrombinase complex to catalyze the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. It was discovered that EGF-N is essential for the recognition and efficient activation of FX by both activators in the presence of the cofactors. On the other hand, the FXa mutant interacted with factor Va with a normal apparent dissociation constant and activated prothrombin with ∼3-fold lower catalytic efficiency in the prothrombinase complex. Surprisingly, the mutant activated prothrombin with ∼12-fold better catalytic efficiency than wild-type FXa in the absence of factor Va. The mutant was inactive in both prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time assays; however, it exhibited a similar specific activity in a one-stage FXa clotting assay. These results suggest that EGF-N of FX is required for the cofactor-dependent zymogen activation by both physiological activators, but it plays no apparent role in FXa recognition of the cofactor in the prothrombinase complex.

FX circulates in plasma as an inactive two-chain zymogen in which the noncatalytic light chain is linked to its catalytic heavy chain by a single disulfide bond (6Leytus S.P. Foster D.C. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5098-5102Google Scholar, 7Stenflo J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1637-1651Google Scholar). Similar to most other vitamin K-dependent coagulation protease zymogens, the structure of the N-terminal light chain of FX is composed of a γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-rich domain followed by two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and the C-terminal heavy chain contains an activation peptide followed by the catalytic domain with a trypsin-like primary specificity pocket (6Leytus S.P.

Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Google Scholar). FX can be activated by either one of its two physiological activators, the factor VIIa-tissue factor (TF) complex (extrinsic Xase) or the factor IXa-VIIIa complex (intrinsic Xase) on negatively charged membrane surfaces in the presence of Ca2+ (9Morrissey J.H. Fakhrai H. Edgington T.S. Cell. 1987; 50: 129-135Google Scholar, 10Lollar P. Fay P.J. Fass D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 128-143Google Scholar, 11Yoshitake S. Schach B.G. Foster D.C. Davie E.W.

In addition, a specific enzyme from Russell's viper venom (RVV-X) can also efficiently activate FX in the presence of Ca2+ (5Jackson C.M. Nemerson Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 765-811Google Scholar, 13Furie B.C. Furie B. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 191-205Google Scholar). All three activators specifically cleave a single peptide bond, Arg15–Ile16 (chymotrypsinogen numbering system (14Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Google Scholar)), on the activation peptide of FX to generate an active enzyme. Efficient cleavage of this peptide bond by both physiological activators occurs only in the presence of the cofactors because neither factor VIIa nor factor IXa by itself can activate FX at a significant rate. Similar to the cofactor-dependent activation of FX, the catalytic activity of FXa toward its natural substrate prothrombin is also cofactor-dependent. In this case, the high affinity binding of factor Va to FXa in the prothrombinase complex enhances the catalytic efficiency of the protease by greater than 5 orders of magnitude (2Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Google Scholar, 15Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5386-5391Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which cofactors improve the catalytic efficiency of coagulation proteases is not well understood. One possible mechanism is that the binding of the cofactors to their target proteases allosterically changes the conformation of the substrate-binding sites in the catalytic pocket of coagulation enzymes to optimize their interaction with residues near the scissile bonds, particularly those located at the P3–P3′ sites (16Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-5Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, a factor VIIIa-mediated conformational change in the active-site pocket of factor IXa has been reported (17Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Google Scholar). Furthermore, binding of TF to factor VIIa is known to increase significantly the rate of hydrolysis of synthetic tripeptidyl chromogenic substrates (18Neuenschwander P.F. Branam D.E. Morrissey J.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 970-977Google Scholar, 19Lawson J.H. Butenas S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4834-4843Google Scholar). However, it has become clear in recent years that in addition to interaction with the target proteases, cofactors must also interact with the zymogens before they can exert their full physiological effect in coagulation reactions. In support of this, recent kinetic and mutagenesis studies have indicated that factor Va interaction with both FXa and prothrombin is required for efficient thrombin generation by the prothrombinase complex (20Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Google Scholar, 21Kalafatis M. Beck D.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12715-12728Google Scholar, 22Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16435-16442Google Scholar, 23Chen L. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27564-27569Google Scholar, 24Beck D.O. Bukys M.A. Singh L.S. Szabo K.A. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3084-3095Google Scholar). Similarly, in addition to interaction with factor VIIa, TF is also known to interact with FX in order to promote substrate activation by the extrinsic Xase complex (25Ruf W. Miles D.J. Rehemtulla A. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6375-6381Google Scholar, 26Huang Q. Neuenschwander P.F. Rezaie A.R. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21752-21757Google Scholar, 27Kirchofer D. Lipari M.T. Moran P. Eigenbrot C. Kelley R.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7380-7387Google Scholar). It is also well established that thrombomodulin binds to both thrombin and protein C in order to enhance the rate of protein C activation by thrombin in the anticoagulant pathway (28Vindigni A. White C.E. Komives E.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Google Scholar, 29Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Google Scholar, 30Yang L. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10484-10490Google Scholar). It is likely that factor VIIIa also functions by a similar mechanism in the intrinsic Xase complex. The multidomain nature of coagulation proteases and their substrates allows them to interact with each other and with their cofactors with a high degree of specificity to form efficient activation complexes on negatively charged membrane surfaces. Previously, the contribution of Gla and N-terminal EGF (EGF-N) domains of FX/Xa to the recognition specificity of the macromolecular complex assembly has been investigated by several different mutagenesis approaches. Studies with the deletion mutants of FX/Xa lacking either Gla or both Gla and EFG-N domains have indicated that the protease domain of FXa has a binding site for factor Va in the prothrombinase complex (20Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Google Scholar, 31Rezaie A.R. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8176-8180Google Scholar). These studies, which were all carried out in solution, also suggested a role for the Gla and/or EGF-N domain of FXa in interaction with the cofactor (31Rezaie A.R. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8176-8180Google Scholar). However, in two other recent studies with a chimeric FXa in which both the Gla and EGF-N domains of the protease were replaced with corresponding domains of factor IX, one study reported that neither Gla nor EGF-N contributes to the affinity of FXa-factor Va interaction on phospholipid vesicles in the prothrombinase complex (32Thiec F. Cherel G. Christophe O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10393-10399Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the second study, employing an identical construct, reported that the Gla and/or EGF-N domains of FXa contribute ∼10-fold to the affinity of the cofactor interaction (33Hertzberg M.S. Ben-Tal O. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14759-14766Google Scholar). The reason for these contradictory results is not known. To investigate further the role of the EGF-N domain of FX/Xa by a different approach, we constructed a deletion mutant of FX in which the exon coding for EGF-N was deleted from FX cDNA. This mutant was expressed in mammalian cells and purified to homogeneity as described (34Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Google Scholar). Unlike the previous mutant lacking both the Gla and EGF-N (E2-FX) (31Rezaie A.R. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8176-8180Google Scholar), this mutant contains an intact Gla domain; thus, the zymogenic and enzymatic properties of this mutant could be characterized in appropriate activation complexes on phospholipid vesicles. In this study, we present data that suggest that the EGF-N domain of FX is required for the zymogen activation by both the extrinsic and intrinsic Xase complexes. On the other hand, the FXa mutant interacted with factor Va with a similar affinity on phospholipid vesicles and activated prothrombin with ∼3-fold impaired catalytic efficiency. Most interesting, the mutant activated prothrombin with ∼12-fold better catalytic efficiency in the absence of factor Va and exhibited a similar or better specific activity in a one-stage FXa clotting assay, although it was inactive in both PT and aPTT assays. These results suggest an important role for EGF-N in recognition and activation of FX by both physiological activators, but this domain appears not to have a specific role in FXa recognition of factor Va in the prothrombinase complex. The implication of these findings for the spacer function of FX/Xa within the activation complexes is discussed. Mutagenesis and Expression of Recombinant Proteins—Construction and expression of wild-type FX in an expression/purification vector system has been described previously (34Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Google Scholar). The EGF-N deletion mutant of FX, lacking the exon coding for the N-terminal EGF domain of FX (FX-desEGF-N), was prepared by PCR mutagenesis methods in the same vector system as described (34Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Google Scholar). After confirmation of the accuracy of the mutagenesis by DNA sequencing, the constructs containing either wild-type or mutant FX cDNA were transfected into HEK293 cells, and the recombinant proteins were isolated from cell culture supernatants by a combination of immunoaffinity and ion exchange chromatography using the HPC4 monoclonal antibody and a Mono Q FPLC column as described (34Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Google Scholar). Recombinant soluble tissue-factor (sTF) and TF lacking the cytoplasmic domain (dcTF), both purified from bacteria (35Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Google Scholar, 36Neuenschwander P.F. Bianco-Fisher E. Rezaie A.R. Morrissey J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13988-13993Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. James Morrissey (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). Human plasma proteins including antithrombin, factors Va, VIIa, IXa, Xa, and X, and the factor X-activating enzyme from RVV-X were purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Human factor VIIIa was a generous gift from Dr. Philip Fay (University of Rochester, New York). Phospholipid vesicles containing 80% phosphatidylcholine and 20% phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) were prepared as described (37Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Google Scholar). The incorporation of dcTF into PC/PS vesicles has been described previously (36Neuenschwander P.F. Bianco-Fisher E. Rezaie A.R. Morrissey J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13988-13993Google Scholar). The chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme FXa (SpFXa) was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT), and S2238 was purchased from Kabi Pharmacia/Chromogenix (Franklin, OH). PT (Thrombomax with Ca2+) and aPTT (Alexin) reagents were purchased from Sigma. Normal pooled plasma and factor X-deficient plasma from a genetically deficient patient were purchased from George King Bio-Medical, Inc. (Overland Park, KS). Activation by the Factors IXa-VIIIa Complex—The initial rate of concentration dependence of FX activation by factor IXa on PC/PS vesicles was studied in both the absence and presence of factor VIIIa as described (38Chen L. Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 431-442Google Scholar). Briefly, the activation of increasing concentrations of the wild-type and mutant FX (7.8–1000 nm) by factor IXa (50 nm in the absence and 0.025–1.0 nm in the presence of factor VIIIa) on PC/PS vesicles (70 μm) was monitored in the absence or presence of a saturating concentration of factor VIIIa (25 nm)in0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% PEG 8000, and 5 mm Ca2+ (TBS/Ca2+) for 2–90 min at room temperature in 30-μl reactions in 96-well assay plates. The activation reactions were terminated by an addition of 20 μl of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the rate of FXa generation was determined by an amidolytic activity assay from the cleavage of 50 μl of 0.4 mm SpFXa at 405 nm by a Vmax Kinetic Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). It was ensured that less than 10% of FX was activated at all substrate concentrations. The Km and kcat values for the activation reactions were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation. Activation by the Factor VIIa-TF Complex—The initial rate of concentration dependence of FX activation on PC/PS vesicles was studied in both the absence and presence of sTF and dcTF incorporated into PC/PS vesicles as described (35Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Google Scholar, 36Neuenschwander P.F. Bianco-Fisher E. Rezaie A.R. Morrissey J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13988-13993Google Scholar). Briefly, the activation of increasing concentrations of the wild-type and mutant FX (7.8–2600 nm) by factor VIIa (20 nm in the absence of and 0.025–1.0 nm in the presence of TF) was monitored in the absence or presence of a saturating concentration of sTF (250 nm) and relipidated dcTF (2 nm) in TBS/Ca2+ for 1–30 min at room temperature in 30-μl reactions in 96-well assay plates. The activation reactions were terminated by an addition of 20 μl of EDTA to obtain a final concentration of 20 mm. The concentration of FXa generated was determined from standard curves by a chromogenic substrate assay as described above. The Km and kcat values for the activation reactions were calculated as described above. Activation by RVV-X and Amidolytic Activity—To evaluate the catalytic properties of the FXa mutant, 500 μl of 2 μm wild-type or mutant zymogen was incubated with 20 nm RVV-X in TBS/Ca2+ for 2 h at 37 °C. To separate the snake venom, the activation reactions were individually applied on a heparin-Sepharose column, and following extensive washes with TBS/Ca2+ containing 0.2 m NaCl, activated proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl as described previously (20Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Google Scholar). Active fractions were pooled and reapplied to the HPC4 monoclonal antibody column that was used to purify both wild-type and mutant zymogens. The HPC4 antibody recognized a 12-residue epitope engineered to the N-terminal end of the activation peptide; thus, activated FX does not bind to the column (34Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Google Scholar). Because the zymogen FX binds to the column, the flow-through of this purification step contains only activated protein. Thus, both unbound wild-type and mutant FXa from the HPC4 column were pooled, concentrated, and active-site titrated by stoichiometric titrations with known concentrations of antithrombin as described (38Chen L. Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 431-442Google Scholar). The steady-state kinetics of hydrolysis of SpFXa (7.8–1000 μm) by the wild-type and mutant FXa (1 nm) were studied in TBS/Ca2+, and the Km and kcat values for substrate hydrolysis were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation as described above. Activation of Prothrombin—The initial rate of prothrombin activation by the wild-type and mutant FXa was determined in both the absence and presence of factor Va at room temperature on PC/PS vesicles as described (34Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Google Scholar). In the absence of the cofactor, prothrombin (10–2500 nm) was incubated with either wild-type or mutant FXa (2.5 nm) in TBS/Ca2+ on PC/PS vesicles (35 μm). Following 5 min of incubation at room temperature, the rate of thrombin generation was measured by an amidolytic activity assay using 100 μm S2238. The concentrations of thrombin generated in the activation reactions were determined from a standard curve prepared from the cleavage rate of S2238 by known concentrations of thrombin under exactly the same conditions. The initial rate of prothrombin activation in the presence of human factor Va (25 nm) was measured by incubating each FXa derivative (25–100 pm) with increasing concentrations of prothrombin (7.8–1000 nm) in TBS/Ca2+ on PC/PS vesicles (35 μm). Following 0.5–2 min of incubation at room temperature, EDTA was added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the concentration of thrombin generated was determined from a standard curve as described above. It was ensured that less than 15% of prothrombin was activated at all concentrations of the substrate. The cofactor dependence of prothrombin activation by FXa was also used to evaluate the apparent affinity of factor Va for the wild-type and mutant FXa. In this case, the activation of a fixed concentration of prothrombin (1 μm) by wild-type or mutant FXa (100 pm) was monitored in the presence of increasing concentrations of human factor Va (0.3–20 nm) on PC/PS vesicles (35 μm). The activation reactions were carried out at room temperature for 0.5–2 min after which EDTA was added to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the apparent dissociation constants were determined from the cofactor-dependent rate of thrombin generation as described (20Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3320-3327Google Scholar). The same assay was also used to evaluate the apparent affinity of FXa derivatives for interaction with PC/PS vesicles. In this case, the activation of prothrombin or prethrombin-1 (prothrombin lacking both Gla and kringle-1 domains) (1 μm) by FXa (0.1–1 nm) in complex with a limiting fixed concentration of factor Va (0.4 nm) was monitored in the presence of increasing concentrations of PC/PS vesicles (0–5 μm) for 1–15 min, and the apparent dissociation constants were determined from the PC/PS-dependent rate of thrombin generation as described above. Measurement of Clotting Activities—Clotting activities of the wild-type and mutant FX were determined by PT, aPTT, and one-stage FXa clotting assays by using a STart 4 fibrinometer (Diagnostica/Stago, Asnieres, France) as described (38Chen L. Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 431-442Google Scholar). For measuring the prothrombin time (PT), 0.1 ml of the PT reagent containing Ca2+ was added to a mixture of 0.05 ml of the test sample (human plasma, recombinant wild-type, or deletion mutant of FX) and 0.05 ml of FX-deficient plasma at 37 °C. Activities of test samples were calculated from a standard curve made by using four different dilutions of normal pooled plasma ranging from 0.1 to 0.025 unit/ml (1 unit/ml corresponds to 8 μg/ml FX). In the case of aPTT assay, 0.050 ml of aPTT reagent was incubated with a mixture of 0.05 ml of FX-deficient plasma and 0.05 ml of the test samples for 5 min before the initiation of clotting by the addition of 0.05 ml of 35 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C. For the one-stage FXa clotting assay, 0.05 ml of 0.05–0.4 nm FXa or FXa-desEGF-N was incubated with 0.05 ml of plasma and 0.05 ml of PC/PS vesicles (10 μg/ml). Clotting was initiated at 37 °C by the addition of 0.05 ml of 25 mm CaCl2. The clotting activities of samples were calculated from at least four dilutions that yielded clotting times in the linear range of the standard curves (17–35 s for PT, 44–64 s for aPTT, and 41–90 s for the one-stage FXa clotting assay). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Both the wild-type and mutant FX were expressed in human 293 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Recombinant proteins were separated from the cell culture supernatants by immunoaffinity chromatography using the HPC4 monoclonal antibody as described previously (34Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Google Scholar). Further purification on a Mono Q column was required to separate the fully and partially γ-carboxylated proteins as described (34Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6780-6788Google Scholar, 38Chen L. Manithody C. Yang L. Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 431-442Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified proteins in both zymogen and active forms under nonreducing conditions indicated that both recombinant FX and the mutant have been purified to homogeneity (data not shown). The wild-type and mutant FX zymogens migrated with the expected relative molecular masses of ∼60 and ∼55 kDa and following activation with the expected molecular masses of ∼45 and ∼40 kDa, respectively (data not shown). FX Activation by the Intrinsic Xase Complex—The zymogenic properties of wild-type and mutant FX were evaluated in kinetic studies by factor IXa in both the absence and presence of factor VIIIa and Ca2+ on PC/PS vesicles (intrinsic Xase complex). The concentration dependence of the activation reactions suggested that factor IXa by itself activates both FX derivatives with similar kcat values; however, Km(app) for activation of the mutant was elevated ∼10-fold (Fig. 1A and Table I). Most interesting, a similar ∼10-fold impairment in the Km(app) value with the mutant was also observed in the presence of factor VIIIa (Fig. 1B and Table I). However, unlike the similar kcat values in the absence of factor VIIIa, the kcat value for the activation of the mutant was also impaired nearly 20-fold (Fig. 1B and Table I). These results suggest that the catalytic efficiency of the intrinsic Xase complex toward the activation of the FX mutant has been impaired ∼200-fold. Thus, the N-terminal domain of FX plays a crucial role in substrate activation by factor IXa in both the absence and presence of the cofactor. A previous study (33Hertzberg M.S. Ben-Tal O. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14759-14766Google Scholar) with a chimeric FX mutant that contained the Gla and EGF-N domains of factor IX demonstrated that neither domain of FX contributed to recognition of the protease or the cofactor in the intrinsic Xase complex. Thus, by assuming that EGF-N of factor IX in the chimeric molecule did not functionally substitute for a potential interactive site of FX in the intrinsic Xase complex, the results here would implicate an important spacer function for EGF-N in FX activation by the intrinsic Xase complex.Table IKinetic parameters for the activation of wild-type and mutant FX zymogens by factors VIIa and IXa in the absence and presence of cofactors on PC/PS vesiclesFXFX-desEGF-NKm(app)kcatKm(app)kcatnms-1nms-1Factor VIIa, PC/PS626 ± 80(2.0 ± 0.1) × 10-4470 ± 53(1.6 ± 0.1) × 10-4Factor VIIa, PC/PS, dcTF55 ± 94.4 ± 0.21035 ± 160(2.0 ± 0.1) × 10-2Factor VIIa, PC/PS, sTF14 ± 3(3.7 ± 0.2) × 10-22313 ± 502(2.1 ± 0.3) × 10-4Factor IXa, PC/PS132 ± 7(2.8 ± 0.2) × 10-51248 ± 185(4.0 ± 0.3) × 10-5Factor IXa, PC/PS, FVIIIa27 ± 22.0 ± 0.03257 ± 140.11 ± 0.002 Open table in a new tab Activation by the Extrinsic Xase Complex—The zymogenic properties of the FX mutant were also evaluated in kinetic studies by factor VIIa in both the absence and presence of TF and Ca2+ on PC/PS vesicles (extrinsic Xase complex). In the absence of a cofactor, factor VIIa activated both wild-type and mutant FX with a similar catalytic efficiency on PC/PS vesicles (Fig. 2, A, inset, and B, and Table I). Consistent with previous results, sTF dramatically accelerated the activation of wild-type FX by factor VIIa (Fig. 2A). Most interesting, however, sTF negatively affected the activation of FX-desEGF-N by factor VIIa as evidenced by an ∼5-fold elevated Km(app) in the presence of the cofactor (Fig. 2B). With the relipidated TF, relative to activation of wild-type FX (Fig. 3A), the catalytic efficiency of factor VIIa toward FX-desEGF-N was impaired more than 4200-fold (Fig. 3B and Table I). Unlike sTF, relipidated TF improved the catalytic efficiency of factor VIIa toward the FX mutant ∼100-fold (compare Figs. 2B and 3B). The dramatic impairment in activation of the mutant was caused by an ∼19-fold elevated Km(app) and ∼220-fold decreased kcat values (Table I). These results suggest that the N-terminal EGF domain of FX plays a critical role in FX activation by the extrinsic Xase complex. The observation that factor VIIa in the absence of a cofactor activates both wild-type and mutant FX at similar rates, further suggests that EGF-N does not interact with the protease but interacts with the cofactor and/or has a spacer function in the extrinsic Xase complex (see below).Fig. 3Concentration dependence of wild-type and mutant FX activation by factor VIIa in complex with relipidated dcTF. A, factor VIIa (25 pm) in complex with the relipidated dcTF (2 nm) was incubated with different concentrations of wild-type FX (○) in TBS/Ca2+. After 90 s of incubation at room temperature, the reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA, and the initial rate of FXa generation was measured by an amidolytic act"
