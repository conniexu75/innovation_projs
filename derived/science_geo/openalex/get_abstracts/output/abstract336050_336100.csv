https://openalex.org/W3003935414,"Experiments involving the laser vaporization of graphite have indicated that one particular duster of carbon, C(60), is preeminently stable; this special stability may be evidence that C(60) can readily take the form of a hollow truncated icosahedron (a sort of molecular soccerball). If true, this structure for C(60) would be the first example of a spherical aromatic molecule. In fact, because of symmetry properties unique to the number 60, it may be the most perfecty spherical, edgeless molecule possible. Its rapid formation in condensing carbon vapors and its extreme chemical and photophysical stability may have far-reaching implications in a number of areas, particularly combustion science and astrophysics. For these reasons C(60) and other dusters of carbon have continued to be the subject of intense research. This article provides a short review of the many new experimental probes of the properties of C(60) and related carbon dusters."

https://openalex.org/W2070559726,"It is not possible at present to demonstrate hominid occupation of southern Africa prior to the middle or late Pliocene, perhaps 3 million years ago. It may be the case that much, if not most, of the subcontinent was in fact uninhabited before that. The earliest hominid known to have lived in southern Africa is Australopithecus africanus. It was apparently replaced by Homo (?evolved into Homo) by 2 million years ago, at approximately the same time as A. robustus is first recorded locally. Homo and A. robustus then coexisted until perhaps 1 million years ago, after which Homo survived alone. There is no solid evidence that either of the southern African australopithecines made tools or accumulated bones. In fact, at the known sites, it now seems more likely that the bones, including those of the australopithecines themselves, were accumulated by carnivores. The known archeological record of southern Africa begins 2 million to 1.5 million years ago and the oldest stone tools may belong to the Oldowan Industry. Far better documentation exists for the succeeding Acheulean Industrial Complex, which was present in southern Africa almost certainly before 1 million years ago and persisted with modifications probably until sometime between 300,000 and 130,000 years ago. Although it is known that Acheulean peoples made handaxes, cleavers, and other stone tools, very little else is known about the activities of Acheuleans in southern Africa. Far more is known about their Middle and Later Stone Age successors. Southern African MSA peoples were perhaps among the earliest anywhere to take systematic advantage of aquatic resources for their subsistence, although they apparently did so far less effectively than did the LSA peoples who followed them. There are also contrasts between the ways in which MSA and LSA peoples dealt with terrestrial prey and between the contents of MSA and LSA artifact assemblages. The LSA peoples, for example, seem to have made much more extensive use of bone as a raw material, and they were the first to manufacture articles that are clearly interpretable as ornaments or art objects. From an evolutionary perspective, the LSA may represent a quantum advance over the MSA, perhaps correlated with the replacement of an archaic human physical type by the modem one. However, this must remain only a working hypothesis until much more is learned about the earliest LSA, dating to 35,000 to 40,000 years ago or more, and until there are adequate samples of well-provenienced MSA and early LSA physical remains. The later LSA, postdating 20,000 to 18,000 years ago, is reasonably well known. Later LSA peoples were probably at least partly responsible for the extinction of several large mammals in southern Africa about 10,000 years ago. By that date or shortly thereafter, at least some LSA peoples established basic hunting-gathering adaptations, which continued until the introduction and spread of agriculture and pastoralism, beginning roughly 2000 years ago. Thereafter, hunters and gatherers became progressively restricted in numbers and distribution, such that today only a very few exist, restricted to some of the most marginal environments of the subcontinent. It remains a major goal of southern African archeology to shed more light on the evolution and operation of hunting-gathering cultures during the vast time span when they covered all of southern Africa."

The recent development of a new intensified, charge coupled-device imager made it possible to record optical emissions during ionospheric heating. Clouds of enhanced airglow are associated with large-scale plasma density cavities that are generated by the heater beam. Trapping and focusing of electromagnetic waves in these cavities produces accelerated electrons that collisionally excite oxygen atoms, which emit light at visible wavelengths. Convection of plasma across magnetic field lines is the primary source for horizontal motion of the cavities and the airglow enhancements. During ionospheric heating experiments, quasi-cyclic formation, convection, dissipation and reappearance of the cavites comprise a major source of long-term variability in plasma densities during ionospheric heating experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2077426569,"Two years of local earthquake, temperature, and rainfall data taken near a tiltmeter site were used in a study of the numerical relation between these phenomena and the recorded tilt response. A least-squares shaping and predictive error filter approach was used. The relations were ranked in part according to the root mean square (r.m.s.) error of fit across the entire sample space. The tilt data with an annual range of tilt of approximately 10 microradians were fitted to the combined weather data of temperature and rainfall with a 0.75-microradian r.m.s. error. The best fit of earthquakes to these same tilt data is the subclass of events with magnitude (M) > 2.5 within 30 kilometers of the tilt site. The filter that mapped earthquakes to tilt yielded a 1.03-microradian r.m.s. error. The most unusual tilt anomaly over the entire 2-year period has the best fit of rainfall to the data for any single month of the entire data set. This unusual anomaly was the basis of an erroneously predicted earthquake (M approximately 5). These data indicate that if there are premonitory earthquake signals, they are buried in local meteorlogical noise. Separating an earthquake anomaly from the response to surface phenomena becomes more difficult as the earthquake anomaly lead time approaches the rise time of the soil to weather and seasonal variations."

https://openalex.org/W2054740240,"An inherent aspect of radiotracer diffusion is that α, β+, or β– emission produces a daughter element of different ionization state. This process must either cause a change in the vacancy concentrations or create space charge, depending on the effectiveness of the internal sources or sinks. Four coupled equations established to model the kinetics, when solved by numerical methods, predict that the apparent tracer diffusion rate may easily be in error by a factor of 2 or 3 and, under certain conditions, by as much as an order of magnitude."
https://openalex.org/W2037358932,"After committing a crime in Ohio, an offender from California, for example, may flee to Florida, having profitably disposed of his stolen goods in still another State. With all the marvels of modern transportation, all this can and does occur while the police pore over the fresh traces at the crime scene. To solve crime in the space-age tempo of today's society demands that law enforcement officers have available immediately the facts of crime whenever or wherever they are likely to confront suspected elements of it."

https://openalex.org/W2066722344,Radioactive (204)Tl(+) was found to diffuse in potassium chloride up to three times more rapidly than stable Tl(+). The difference is attributed to the (204)Pb(2+) daughter element produced by beta(-)emission. A theoretical model accounts satisfactorily for the discrepancy and indicates that internal sources of cation vacancies are effective in maintaining electroneutrality at all but low temperatures.
