https://openalex.org/W2016091065,"Intramuscular injection of BMP-2 induces ectopic bone formation in vivo. Similarly, BMP-2 treatment blocks myogenic differentiation and induces osteoblastic transdifferentiation of premyoblastic C2C12 cells. Previous reports suggested that BMP-2-stimulated Runx2 expression could play a pivotal role in transdifferentiation. However, increased Runx2 expression by TGF-β1 did not support osteoblast differentiation in vitro. These results indicate that the induction of Runx2 is not sufficient to explain the BMP-induced transdifferentiation. We found that Dlx5 is specifically expressed in osteogenic cells, and is specifically induced by BMP-2 or -4 signaling but not by other osteotrophic signals or other TGF-β superfamily members. Cycloheximide treatment indicated that Dlx5 was immediately induced by BMP signaling, while Runx2 required de novo protein synthesis. In addition, blocking or overexpressing each transcription factor indicated that Dlx5 is an indispensable mediator of BMP-2-induced Runx2 expression but is not involved in TGF-β1-induced Runx2 expression. Moreover, TGF-β1 opposed BMP-2-induced osteogenic transdifferentiation through Dlx5 suppression by de novo induction of AP-1. Taken together, these results indicate that Dlx5 is an indispensable regulator of BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation as well as the counteraction point of the opposing TGF-β1 action."
https://openalex.org/W2073788301,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a lysosomotropic amine with cytotoxic properties. Here, we show that HCQ induces signs of lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), such as the decrease in the lysosomal pH gradient and the release of cathepsin B from the lysosomal lumen, followed by signs of apoptosis including caspase activation, phosphatidylserine exposure, and chromatin condensation with DNA loss. HCQ also induces mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP), as indicated by the insertion of Bax into mitochondrial membranes, the conformational activation of Bax within mitochondria, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and the loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. To determine the molecular order among these events, we introduced inhibitors of LMP (bafilomycin A(1)), MMP (Bcl-X(L), wild-type Bcl-2, mitochondrion-targeted Bcl-2, or viral mitochondrial inhibitor of apoptosis from cytomegalovirus), and caspases (Z-VAD.fmk) into the system. Our data indicate that caspase-independent MMP is rate-limiting for LMP-mediated caspase activation. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking the expression of both Bax and Bak are resistant against hydroxychloroquine-induced apoptosis. Such Bax(-/-) Bak(-/-) cells manifest normal LMP, yet fail to undergo MMP and subsequent cell death. The data reported herein indicate that LMP does not suffice to trigger caspase activation and that Bax/Bak-dependent MMP is a critical step of LMP-induced cell death."

In this study, we used site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the structural features of monomeric and fibrillar α-synuclein. Our results indicate that monomeric α-synuclein, in solution, has a highly dynamic structure, in agreement with the notion that α-synuclein is a natively unfolded protein. In contrast, fibrillar aggregates of α-synuclein exhibit a distinct domain organization. Our data identify a highly ordered and specifically folded central core region of ∼70 amino acids, whereas the N terminus is structurally more heterogeneous and the C terminus (∼40 amino acids) is completely unfolded. Interestingly, the central core region of α-synuclein exhibits several features reminiscent of those observed in the core region of fibrillar Alzheimer's amyloid β peptide, including an in-register parallel structure. Although the lengths of the respective core regions differ, fibrils from different amyloid proteins nevertheless appear to be able to take up highly similar, and possibly conserved, structures.

Although the lengths of the respective core regions differ, fibrils from different amyloid proteins nevertheless appear to be able to take up highly similar, and possibly conserved, structures. The deposition of amyloid fibrils has been linked to a variety of slow-onset degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), 1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson's disease; NAC, non-Aβ component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid; SDSL, site-directed spin labeling; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy; Aβ, amyloid β. type II diabetes mellitus, and spongiform encephalopathies. In the case of PD, these amyloid fibrils are formed by α-synuclein (1Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6267) Google Scholar), which is found in intracellular inclusions of dopaminergic neurons, called Lewy bodies. Several lines of evidence suggest that α-synuclein plays a causative role in PD. Linkage studies have shown that rare familial forms of early-onset PD, inherited as an autosomal dominant form, result from two independent missense mutations (A53T and A30P) within the α-synuclein gene (2Polymeropoulos M.H.

Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar) and other animal (5Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar), cytoplasmic protein, found in presynaptic terminals of neuronal cells (9Iwai A. Masliah E. Yoshimoto M. Ge N.

Brain Res. 1991; 11: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Although the precise physiological role of this protein is not fully understood, it has been suggested that α-synuclein is involved in the modulation of neurotransmitter release (11Murray I.V. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Clin. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 1: 445-455Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In aqueous solution, α-synuclein has been found to be highly dynamic and, therefore, has been classified as a natively unfolded protein (8Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). However, upon aggregation, some not yet well-defined regions of α-synuclein undergo a conformational change and take up a cross-β-structure (12Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 13Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), in which individual β-strands run perpendicular to the fiber axis. Originally, a 35-amino acid fragment of α-synuclein was isolated from brain tissue of Alzheimer patients (14Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). This fragment (amino acids 61–95), designated NAC (non-amyloid β (Aβ) component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid), comprises the hydrophobic core of the protein and has been shown to be important in fibril formation (15Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Masliah E. Saitoh T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10139-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). More recent analysis suggests, however, that the core domain of α-synuclein might be even shorter. In the latter study, a 12-amino acid peptide (residues 71–82), located within the NAC region, was shown to be capable of undergoing self-aggregation (16Giasson B.I. Murray I.V. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2380-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The importance of this hydrophobic stretch is further supported by its absence in β-synuclein, a homologue of α-synuclein (17Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar), with strongly reduced propensity for fibril formation (12Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 18Biere A.L. Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Anafi D. Jacobsen F.W. Jarosinski M.A. Wu G.M.

In contrast, a third line of evidence, based on protease digestion studies (19Miake H. Mizusawa H. Iwatsubo T. Hasegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19213-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), suggests that the core region of α-synuclein is longer. In this study, a 7-kDa fragment (comprising residues 31–109) was shown to be protected from proteinase K digestion. This region contains the putative 12-residue core domain, as well as the NAC region. In an effort to determine which of these core regions potentially correspond to the cross-β-structure and to decipher the overall structural features of α-synuclein fibrils, we used site-directed spin labeling (SDSL), together with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Although SDSL had originally been developed to study the structural and conformational dynamics of soluble and membrane proteins (20Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), this method has recently been applied successfully to structural and dynamic studies of other amyloid proteins, such as Aβ (21Török M. Milton S. Kayed R. Wu P. McIntire T. Glabe C.G. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40810-40815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and transthyretin (22Serag A.A. Altenbach C. Gingery M. Hubbell W.L. Yeates T.O. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9089-9096Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). SDSL is based upon the introduction of a cysteine-specific nitroxide spin label, which serves as a reporter molecule, into selected sites of the protein to generate the side chain R1 (Fig. 1). The structural environment of the spin label can then be monitored by EPR spectroscopy. The mobility information contained in the EPR spectra can be used to distinguish between loop, surface, or buried sites (23Margittai M. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Jahn R. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13169-13177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Isas J.M. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In nitroxide scanning experiments, this information can furthermore be used to determine secondary structural elements (20Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). In addition, the distance between two R1 side chains can be estimated based on magnetic dipolar interactions (20Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Our findings show that α-synuclein, in its fibrillar state, has a distinct domain organization. We identified a core region of ∼70 amino acids (residues 34–101), packed in highly ordered, parallel fashion, with the same residues from different strands in exact register. Similar parallelism was also observed in the core regions of synthetic Aβ fibrils assembled in vitro using SDSL (21Török M. Milton S. Kayed R. Wu P. McIntire T. Glabe C.G. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40810-40815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The N terminus of fibrillar α-synuclein is structurally more heterogeneous, displaying a less ordered structural organization. The C-terminal region of the protein remains unfolded, even within fibrillar bundles. Taken together, these findings suggest that there may be a common mechanism underlying the formation of amyloid fibrils, at least in Alzheimer's disease and PD. α-Synuclein Mutagenesis—The wild-type human α-synuclein expression construct (pRK172) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Goedert. Wild-type α-synuclein sequence contains no cysteine residues. Single cysteine mutants for spin labeling were generated using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The introduced mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. α-Synuclein Expression and Purification—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLys-S cells were transformed with the pRK172 construct by heat shock. Expression of α-synuclein was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C overnight. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min and lysed in 500 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysate was then boiled for 10 min and subsequently centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was precipitated in acid at pH 3.5 and centrifuged for an additional 30 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and loaded onto a HiTrap ANX column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer. Proteins were eluted in a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. α-Synuclein-containing fractions were pooled and applied to a HiTrap Q XL column (Amersham Biosciences) and were identified by SDS-PAGE. Protein purity was >95%, as judged by Coomassie Blue staining and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The concentration of purified proteins was determined using the Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Spin Labeling and EPR Measurements—Purified proteins were filtered through Microcon YM-100 (molecular weight cut off, 1 × 105) (Amicon, Bedford, MA) spin filter units to ensure the absence of preexisting α-synuclein aggregates. Immediately before spin labeling, dithiothreitol was removed from the buffer using size exclusion chromatography (PD-10 columns, Amersham Biosciences). The composition of the buffer used for equilibration and spin labeling was 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl. Sulfhydryl groups of the purified cysteine mutants were then reacted with a 3-fold molar excess of the spin label [1-oxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-d-pyrroline-3-methyl]-methanethiosulfonate (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) (see Fig. 1) at room temperature for 1 h. Unreacted spin label was removed using PD-10 columns. Spin-labeled proteins were concentrated using Microcon YM-3 (molecular weight cut off, 3,000) (Amicon, Bedford, MA). Fibrillar or monomeric α-synuclein was loaded into sealed glass capillaries for subsequent EPR analysis. EPR spectroscopy was performed using the Bruker EMX spectrometer (Bruker Instruments, Billerica, MA), fitted with a loop-gap resonator (26Hubbell W.L. Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1987; 58: 1879-1886Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar) for room temperature measurements and with an ER 4119HS resonator for measurements taken at –40 °C. X-band room temperature EPR spectra were obtained at 2 mW incident microwave power and at a field modulation of 1.5 Gauss at 100 kHz over a scan range of 150 Gauss. Spectra were accumulated over 20 scans. All first-derivative EPR spectra were normalized by double integration to represent the same number of spins. To correct for small amounts of free spin label and/or nonspecific labeling, all spectra were baseline corrected by subtracting the spectrum of spin-labeled (Cys-less) wild-type α-synuclein, which yielded a highly characteristic sharp line shape of 1.6 Gauss. This subtraction amounted to ∼5% of the signal (data not shown). Inter-spin distances can be quantified based upon magnetic dipolar interactions (20Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 27Hustedt E.J. Smirnov A.I. Laub C.F. Cobb C.E. Beth A.H. Biophys.

Here, distances between the same R1 labels within α-synuclein strands were determined using a Pake pattern-based simulation software generously provided by Drs. Hubbell and Altenbach (31Altenbach C. Oh K.J. Trabanino R.J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), which has proven successful in measuring inter-spin distances within fibrils of Aβ (21Török M. Milton S. Kayed R. Wu P. McIntire T. Glabe C.G. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40810-40815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Using this software, distances between R1-labeled derivatives of α-synuclein were measured by comparing the EPR spectra of fully labeled protein with those co-mixed with an equal molar ratio of unlabeled wild-type protein (spin diluted), as described previously (21Török M.

Trabanino R.J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Any residual coupling in the spin-diluted spectra were removed by subtracting the spin-coupled spectrum using the built-in option in the program. α-Synuclein Fibril Assembly—Purified spin labeled proteins (4 mg/ml) were incubated in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% NaN3 at 37 °C for 7–10 days with stirring. Fibrils were isolated by centrifugation and washed twice with 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. Purified, unlabeled wild-type α-synuclein was used for spin-dilution experiments. Spin-labeled derivatives of α-synuclein were mixed with unlabeled wild-type protein in a 1:1 molar ratio at 4 mg/ml of total protein concentrations. Structural Changes upon Transition from Monomeric to Fibrillar α-Synuclein—To identify the structural organization of soluble and fibrillar α-synuclein, single spin labels were introduced at selected sites throughout the protein, and their EPR spectra were recorded in solution and in fibrils. As shown in Fig. 2, the EPR spectra for all α-synuclein derivatives in solution (monomeric; black traces) are very similar and are characterized by sharp and narrowly spaced lines. Such spectral features arise from the rapid motion of the R1 label and are typical of highly dynamic and unfolded structures, in close agreement with the notion of α-synuclein as a “natively unfolded” protein (8Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). Next, by growing fibrils from spin-labeled α-synuclein derivatives, we sought to determine how this unfolded structure is altered upon fibril formation. Fibril morphology for all sites was verified by electron microscopy (data not shown) and was found to be very similar to fibrils taken from wild-type α-synuclein (15Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Masliah E. Saitoh T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10139-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 32El-Agnaf O.M. Jakes R. Curran M.D. Middleton D. Ingenito R. Bianchi E. Pessi A. Neill D. Wallace A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 33Han H. Weinreb P.H. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 163-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the effect of fibril formation on the EPR spectra of α-synuclein derivatives containing spin labels at selected sites in the C terminus (103R1, 106R1, 107R1, 124R1, 127R1, 130R1, 131R1, and 136R1; green trace). As was the case in solution, these sites gave rise to very sharp and narrowly spaced lines, even after fibril formation. Thus, we found little evidence of any ordering in the C-terminal region of α-synuclein aggregates and believe it is likely that the C-terminal region remains largely unfolded, even after fibril formation (also see discussion of Fig. 3 below). To test whether structural changes might occur in the N-terminal 100 amino acids of α-synuclein, we recorded the room temperature EPR spectra of fibrillar α-synuclein labeled at positions 5R1, 26R1, 68R1, and 88R1, respectively (Fig. 2B, green and red traces). Residues 5R1 and 26R1 showed some decrease in signal amplitude (Fig. 2B, green trace), whereas residues 68R1 and 88R1, located in the NAC region of the protein, showed a marked decrease in amplitude (Fig. 2B, green trace). To clearly visualize details of the line shape, spectra of fibrillar 68R1 and 88R1 were scaled at 10- and 5-fold, respectively (Fig. 2B, red trace). In addition to a strong reduction of signal intensity, we also observed a pronounced spectral broadening, characterized by the overall width of the spectrum exceeding 100 Gauss (all spectra were accumulated in a magnetic scan range of 150 Gauss). These spectral features are indicative of very strong spin-spin interactions and are reminiscent of what was observed for fibrillar Aβ peptide (21Török M. Milton S. Kayed R. Wu P. McIntire T. Glabe C.G. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40810-40815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), suggesting that some regions of α-synuclein, as in Aβ, might also be arranged in parallel fashion. α-Synuclein Fibrils Exhibit a Core Region of Parallel and In-register Structure—To further confirm the presence of spin-spin interactions and to probe the extent of a parallel, ordered structure, we recorded the EPR spectra of the R1-labeled α-synuclein fibrils in their frozen state (Fig. 3). Two factors can significantly contribute to changes in amplitude and line shape, namely, mobility and spin-spin interactions between nearby labels because of dipolar coupling and spin exchange (20Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). In the frozen state, EPR spectra are no longer influenced by local structure and mobility; therefore, major changes in the EPR line shapes can be attributed solely to spin-spin interactions. EPR spectra of sites ∼34R1 through ∼101R1 show clear spin-spin interactions, as reflected in the marked drop in signal intensity and a spectral line broadening beyond 100 Gauss (Fig. 3, green trace). A lesser effect was seen at the N-terminal regions of fibrillar α-synuclein, and little or no effect was observed at C-terminal sites (103R1, 106R1, 107R1, 109R1, 124R1, 127R1, 131R1, and 136R1), which exhibited relatively large amplitudes. These EPR spectra are indicative of the absence of strong spin-spin interactions, in agreement with the data shown in Fig. 2A, indicating that this region is not ordered. To further confirm and quantify the effect of spin-spin interactions, we performed spin-dilution experiments, wherein R1-labeled and wild-type α-synuclein were co-mixed and allowed to form fibrils over time (see “Experimental Procedures”). Such experiments were conducted based upon the following rationale: if wild-type α-synuclein and its R1-labeled derivatives were to co-mix interchangeably to form fibrils, the potential of one spin label located on a given α-synuclein protein coming in close proximity to another spin label located on a neighboring protein would be expected to decrease as a function of increasing concentration of unlabeled wild-type protein. Thus, spin-spin interactions would be reduced upon co-mixing of the R1-labeled and wild-type α-synuclein. As a result, the EPR spectral line shapes would become sharper and narrower. Dilution experiments were performed, and once again, fibril formation was verified by electron microscopy (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, these wild-type dilutions resulted in highly similar EPR spectra for all of the sites (black traces). A comparison of the spectra from R1-labeled (green traces) and wild-type-diluted fibrils (black traces) shows that the largest spectral changes occurred in sites between ∼34R1 and ∼101R1. Within this region, spin dilution caused a significant loss of spin-spin interaction, as can be seen from the increase in signal intensity and the concomitant decrease in spectral breadth. In contrast, the EPR spectral changes in the N- and C-terminal regions of α-synuclein fibrils are much smaller. In addition to its importance in demonstrating spin-spin interactions, the co-mixing of wild-type and R1-labeled proteins indicates that the R1-labeled and wild-type proteins are able to adopt similar structures within the fibril. Thus, as has already been observed for Alzheimer's Aβ (21Török M. Milton S. Kayed R. Wu P. McIntire T. Glabe C.G. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40810-40815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), the introduction of R1 is tolerated remarkably well in amyloid fibrils. For a more quantitative evaluation of the spin-spin interactions, we determined the distances between spin labels, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Distances obtained by SDSL are very accurate, as reported previously in a comparison of distances obtained by x-ray crystallographic methods with those obtained by SDSL in T4 lysozyme (28Mchaourab H.S. Oh K.J. Fang C.J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It is important to note, however, that SDSL measures distances between the nitroxide side chains of the spin labels rather than between the protein backbone atoms. A summary of distance distributions of filamentous α-synuclein using SDSL is shown in Fig. 4A, wherein the percentage of distance distributions is plotted against the corresponding residue number. Red columns represent distance distributions beyond 20 Å, yellow columns indicate distance distributions between 15 and 20 Å, and black columns are indicative of distance distributions of <15 Å. As depicted in this figure, the distance contributions from residues ∼34 to ∼101 are <15 Å (typically 8–11 Å) (black columns), with negligible amounts of distance contributions from longer distances (red columns), which is indicative of a highly specific, in-register arrangement of α-synuclein amyloid fibrils. Interestingly, the degree of parallelism includes but extends beyond residues 71–82 and the amyloidogenic NAC region. The C-terminal residues of the protein primarily exhibit distance distributions of >20 Å (red columns), which is consistent with the data presented in Figs. 2 and 3, showing that the C-terminal region of α-synuclein is unstructured. A much more heterogeneous distance distribution is observed in the N-terminal region of α-synuclein. Structural heterogeneity may arise from the existence of multiple conformations as observed in other amyloid fibrils such as Aβ (21Török M. Milton S. Kayed R. Wu P. McIntire T. Glabe C.G. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40810-40815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) studied by EPR and by protease digestion studies of the Aβ peptide (34Kheterpal I. Williams A. Murphy C. Bledsoe B. Wetzel R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11757-11767Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The principal objective of this study was to identify the overall structural organization of α-synuclein fibrils. Using SDSL and EPR analysis, we observed a distinctive domain organization in α-synuclein fibrils. We found a core region of ∼70 residues that is flanked by shorter N- and C-terminal domains of ∼30 and 40 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the core region is characterized by strong spin-spin interactions arising from the close proximity of R1 side chains (mostly, 8–11 Å distances between nitroxide groups) of the same residues from different α-synuclein molecules, thus indicating the formation of highly ordered packing interactions that result in a homogeneous, parallel, and in-register structure. The core region of α-synuclein, identified by SDSL and EPR, contains the NAC domain, as well as the hydrophobic 12-residue peptide 71VTGVTAVAQKTV82, which was found to be necessary and sufficient for fibril formation (16Giasson B.I. Murray I.V. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2380-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). However, our data demonstrate that the core region of α-synuclein fibrils extends beyond these regions to a significant extent, a finding that is further supported by a proteinase K-resistant fragment (residues 31–109) identified recently by Miake et al. (19Miake H. Mizusawa H. Iwatsubo T. Hasegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19213-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It is important to note that a parallel arrangement of amyloid fibrils is not limited to α-synuclein alone. In fact, a number of studies on Alzheimer's Aβ peptide by SDSL (21Török M. Milton S. Kayed R. Wu P. McIntire T. Glabe C.G. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40810-40815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and solid-state NMR (35Tycko R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3151-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) have revealed that this peptide is also packed in a parallel and highly specific manner. Studies involving many different amyloid fibril-forming proteins have revealed an overwhelming number of similarities in the mechanism(s) of fibril formation. For example, amyloid fibrillogenesis consistently appears to be a nucleation-dependent process (36Lansbury Jr., P.T. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1151-1154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) that ultimately results in a cross-β structure, where individual strands run perpendicular to the fiber axis (37Makin O.S. Serpell L.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, all amyloid fibrils exhibit specific tinctorial properties, i.e. they bind Congo red and Thioflavin S (38Soto C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Common structural features of amyloids are furthermore supported by conformational antibodies that appear to recognize a common amyloid fibril fold that seems to be shared by a number of different amyloid fibrils (39O'Nuallain B. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This overall structural similarity might even extend to prefibrillar structures, considering that another conformationally specific antibody recognizes protofibrillar aggregates from various amyloidogenic proteins, including α-synuclein (40Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar). Thus, in light of these similarities, it is possible that parallel arrangement is a general feature of the core regions of amyloid fibrils. In contrast to this possibly conserved and highly organized structural arrangement in the core region of α-synuclein fibrils, we find little evidence of any ordered structure in the C terminus of α-synuclein fibrils. It is therefore unlikely that the C terminus contributes to the stability of fibrils. In fact, it is conceivable that the high negative charge density of the C terminus could cause significant electrostatic repulsions, a feature that may serve to prevent a further extension of the parallel-arranged core region beyond residue 101. A fibril-destabilizing role of the C terminus is further supported by kinetic analysis that has shown a significant enhancement in fibril formation upon removal of the C-terminal regions (12Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 41Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Although it is unclear if removal of this destabilizing region contributes to enhanced fibril formation in vivo, it is interesting to note that partially truncated α-synuclein at the C terminus has been isolated from Lewy bodies of patients suffering from dementia with Lewy bodies (42Baba M. Nakajo S. Tu P.H. Tomita T. Nakaya K. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Iwatsubo T. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 879-884PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of a distinct domain organization in α-synuclein fibrils, together with the finding of strong parallelism in the core region, constitutes a first step toward understanding the mechanism of fibrillogenesis and places constraints on possible structural models. Additional structural constraints can be obtained from simple geometrical considerations. For example, we can eliminate the possibility of parallel, fully extended strands containing 70 amino acids. Given the 3.5-Å axial distance between adjacent amino acids in an extended β-strand, the parallel polypeptide core region of α-synuclein would be ∼250 Å (25 nm) in length; however, this length exceeds the narrowest fiber dimension (6 nm) reported for α-synuclein fibrils (12Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Thus, several turn and bend regions must exist to account for such geometrical dimensions (21Török M. Milton S. Kayed R. Wu P. McIntire T. Glabe C.G. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40810-40815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 43Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). The existence of hairpins consisting of anti-parallel β-strands has been proposed for α-synuclein (13Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 44Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D. Kaufman S.A. Martin F. Sitney K. Denis P. Louis J.C. Wypych J. Biere A.L. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9843-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and Aβ fibrils (45Fraser P.E. Nguyen J.T. Inouye H. Surewicz W.K. Selkoe D.J. Podlisny M.B. Kirschner D.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10716-10723Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 46Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), based upon Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy analysis of amyloid fibrils and those of soluble proteins containing such antiparallel strands. A general model for a two-stranded hairpin with anti-parallel β-strands is shown in Fig. 5A, where the interstrand distance is ∼5 Å, the intersheet distance is estimated at ∼10 Å, and the β-strands run perpendicular to the fiber axis (37Makin O.S. Serpell L.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To observe parallelism, one might envision a parallel arrangement of individual hairpins in which the same residues will be at ∼10 Å distance from each other (Fig. 5A, red marks). Such a structure could be taken up entirely by shorter peptides, such as NAC or the Aβ peptide. However, for the much longer core region of α-synuclein, this arrangement would not be likely because additional strands (probably at least four) and bend regions are required to accommodate ∼70 amino acids under the constraints of the fiber dimensions (see Fig. 5B). The resulting distances between the same residues in different molecules, repeated along the fibril axis (≥25 Å), would be outside the detectable range using the current approach and clearly too long to account for the strong spin-spin interaction observed from the EPR data presented herein. Nevertheless, it is still possible to account for parallelism if the sheets are arranged in parallel fashion, as depicted in Fig. 5C. Although we cannot exclude such a model based on the EPR data alone, this model could not readily explain the growth and propagation properties of amyloid fibrils. As an example, the contact surface for growth in the fibril direction would be limited to only a single β-strand region, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 5D. Furthermore, if the parallel sheet packing is stabilizing, one might expect greater variations in the number of stacked sheets; in turn, this could result in highly irregular fibril thickness, a feature not generally observed in fibrillar assemblies. Problems of this nature would not be encountered with the model shown in Fig. 5E. This model is based on the existence of parallel strands that are interrupted by a number of regions that cause bending of the entire sheet. The model shown in Fig. 5E represents one of several possible organizations to which such bent regions could be achieved. One positive feature of this model is that the fibril propagation can be easily explained, i.e. both fibril ends would expose an extensive surface of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors that could act as templates for incoming molecules (see Fig. 5F). Such “template-guided folding” would further ensure that precise conformation and fibril type would be maintained. Additional support for such a model is derived from a recent solid-state NMR analysis of Aβ1–40 peptide (47Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutkin O.N. Leapman R.D. Delaglio F. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16742-16747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar), which showed that individual strands, rather than sheets of hairpins, are arranged in parallel. Through future studies using SDSL and EPR, we hope to prove the validity of the model in Fig. 5E (and variations thereof, possibly including some β-helical structures) and to identify the location(s) of the bend or turn regions. Similarly, this approach should also enable a more detailed structural analysis of prefibrillar intermediates and their membrane-bound forms. We thank Dr. M. Goedert for the provision of the α-synuclein DNA construct and are grateful to Lena Te and Winnie Tse for their outstanding technical support."

FGF homologous factors (FHF1–FHF4; also known as FGF11–FGF14) are related to FGFs by substantial sequence homology, yet their only documented interactions are with an intracellular kinase scaffold protein, islet brain-2 (IB2) and with voltage-gated sodium channels. In this report, we show that recombinant FHFs can bind heparin with high affinity like classical FGFs yet fail to activate any of the seven principal FGFRs. Instead, we demonstrate that FHFs bind IB2 directly, furthering the contention that FHFs and FGFs elicit their biological effects by binding to different protein partners. To understand the molecular basis for this differential target binding specificity, we elucidated the crystal structure of FHF1b to 1.7-Å resolution. The FHF1b core domain assumes a β-trefoil fold consisting of 12 antiparallel β strands (β1 through β12). The FHF1b β-trefoil core is remarkably similar to that of classical FGFs and exhibits an FGF-characteristic heparin-binding surface as attested to by the number of bound sulfate ions. Using molecular modeling and structure-based mutational analysis, we identified two surface residues, Arg52 in the β4–β5 loop and Val95 in the β9 strand of FHF1b that are required for the interaction of FHF1b with IB2. These two residues are unique to FHFs, and mutations of the corresponding residues of FGF1 to Arg and Val diminish the capacity of FGF1 to activate FGFRs, suggesting that these two FHF residues contribute to the inability of FHFs to activate FGFRs. Hence, FHFs and FGFs bear striking structural similarity but have diverged to direct related surfaces toward interaction with distinct protein targets.

Itoh N. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 1-12Crossref Google Scholar). During embryogenesis, FGFs govern the development of parenchymal organs, such as the lung and limb, which require directional epithelial-mesenchymal communication (2Martin G.

FGFs exert their diverse actions by binding, dimerizing, and activating members of the FGF receptor family (FGFR1–FGFR4) of receptor tyrosine kinases. Both FGFs and FGFR must also interact with heparan sulfate glycosaminglycans (HS) for sustainable FGF-FGFR binding and dimerization to occur (7Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E.

Like FGF9 subfamily members, FHFs lack a recognizable secretory signal sequence. However, whereas FGF9 subfamily members are efficiently secreted as glycoproteins (21Miyamoto M. Naruo K. Seko C.

It is note-worthy that the prototypical FGFs, FGF1 and FGF2, also lack a signal peptide and are only poorly secreted from transfected cell lines. Current data suggest that these FGFs may be released from cells via a mechanism independent of ER-Golgi such as cell injury (24Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K.A. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc.

However, no interactions of FHFs with HS and FGFRs have been reported.For each FHF, multiple isoforms differing only in the N-terminal region preceding the β-trefoil core are generated through alternative promoter usage and differential splicing of 5′-exons (20Hartung H.

In chickens, FHFs are also expressed in the developing limbs and face (31Munoz-Sanjuan I. Fallon J.F. Nathans J. Mech.

Targeted disruption of FGF14 (FHF4) in mice has been shown to cause ataxia and paroxysmal dyskinesia, and a loss of function mutation in FGF14 (FHF4) has been detected in patients with autosomal dominant cerebral ataxia (33Wang Q. Bardgett M.E. Wong M. Wozniak D.F. Lou J. McNeil B.D. Chen C. Nardi A. Reid D.C. Yamada K. Ornitz D.M.

Indeed, two cytoplasmic binding partners for FHFs have been identified. One such target is the mitogen-activated protein kinase scaffolding protein islet brain 2 (IB2), which was identified using FHF1b as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system and was then validated as a native binding partner through detection of FHF1·IB2 complexes in brain extracts (35Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This interaction is highly specific, since intracellular FGF1 fails to bind IB2, nor can FHF bind the related mitogen-activated protein kinase scaffold protein IB1 (JIP-1) (35Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that FHF-IB2 complex formation facilitates the recruitment of p38δ mitogen-activated protein kinase to IB2, allowing p38δ to be phosphorylated and activated by IB2-associated upstream kinases (36Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49111-49119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Other potential intracellular targets for FHFs are voltage-gated sodium channels. The cytoplasmic tails of two such channels, Nav1.5 and Nav1.9, have been shown to bind FHF1b in a yeast two-hybrid screen and GST fusion protein pull-down assays (37Liu C. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G.

More recent data suggest that FHF binding may modulate the electrophysiological properties of Nav1.5 (38Liu C.J. Dib-Hajj S.D. Renganathan M. Cummins T.R. Waxman S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1029-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).In this report, we prepared purified recombinant FHF proteins to assay them for the ability to interact with FGFRs and IB2. Our data show that FHFs do not activate any of seven principal cell surface FGFRs but do bind directly to the intracellular protein IB2. Using the newly determined FHF1b crystal structure and structure-based mutagenesis, we identified two residues unique to FHFs that contribute to the differential target specificity of FHFs. The data provide details of how, despite striking structural homology, FHFs and FGFs have diverged to direct related surfaces toward interaction with distinct protein targets.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Purification—The DNA fragment encoding the “b” isoform of human FHF1 (FHF1b; residues 1–181) (see Fig. 4B for residue numbering) (20Hartung H. Feldman B. Lovec H. Coulier F. Birnbaum D. Goldfarb M. Mech. Dev. 1997; 64: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pET-3 bacterial expression vector. In order to prevent disulfide-mediated dimer formation, Cys144 of FHF1b was mutated to alanine (the corresponding residue in all other FHFs). Monomeric FHF1b was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells and was purified by heparin affinity, ion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography. The C-terminally truncated form of FHF1b (FHF1b1–142) was generated by PCR with mutagenic primers. The FHF1bV95N, FHF1bR52G, and FHF1bV95N/R52G mutants were generated by multicycle DNA synthesis with Pfu DNA polymerase and complementary mutagenic primers (QuikChange mutagenesis; Stratagene). FHF1b1–142, FHF1bV95N, and FHF1bR52G were expressed and purified using the same protocol as for FHF1b.To express FHF4b, the DNA fragment encoding residues 64–252 of the “b” isoform of human FHF4 (FHF4b) (23Wang Q. McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was amplified and subcloned into the pET-28a bacterial expression vector. FHF4b was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells and was purified using the same protocol as for FHF1b. Consistent with having an alanine in the position homologous to Cys144 of FHF1b, FHF4b did not form disulfide-linked dimers.Bacterially expressed human FGF1 (residues 22–155) was purified by heparin affinity as previously described (39Wang J.K. Gao G. Goldfarb M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). FGF1N110V and FGF1G67R mutants were generated by multicycle DNA synthesis with Pfu DNA polymerase and complementary mutagenic primers (QuikChange™ mutagenesis; Stratagene). The FGF1N110V and FGF1G67R mutants were expressed and purified using the same protocol as for FGF1.Crystallization, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Repeated attempts to crystallize freshly purified FHF1b failed; however, after a few weeks of storage at 4 °C, the FHF1b sample crystallized. Analysis of FHF1b crystals by mass spectrometry yielded a molecular mass of 16.3 kDa corresponding to FHF1b residues 1–144. Crystals of the truncated FHF1b fragment were grown by vapor diffusion at 20 °C using the conventional hanging drop method. 2 μl of FGF1b protein (45 mg/ml in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl) were mixed with an equal volume of crystallization buffer (20–25% PEG 400, 200 mm ammonium sulfate). The FHF1b crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions α = 30.62 Å, β = 58.85 Å, γ = 65.42 Å. The asymmetric unit contains a single FHF1b molecule with a solvent content of 38.67%. Crystals were flash-frozen in a dry nitrogen stream using mother liquor with 10% glycerol as cryoprotectant. Diffraction data were collected on a charge-coupled device detector at beamline X4A at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. The data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (40Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar).The program AMORE (41Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr.

Rigid body, positional, and B-factor refinement and simulated annealing were performed using CNS (42Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

The N-terminal residues 1–5 are disordered. The average B factors are 21.93 Å2 for all atoms, 21.50 Å2 for FHF1b, 25.46 Å2 for the water molecules, and 39.86 Å2 for the sulfate ions.BaF3/FGFR Viability Assay—BaF3 cell lines transfected to express each of the seven principal FGFR isoforms (FGFR1-IIIb, FGFR1-IIIc, FGFR2-IIIb, FGFR2-IIIc, FGFR3-IIIb, FGFR3-IIIc, and FGFR4) have been described previously (44Ornitz D.M.

For agonist viability assays, cells were plated in 96-cluster miniwells at 104 cells/well in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml heparin, and increasing concentrations of wild-type or mutant FGF1 or FHFs. Viable cells were quantified by MTT assay after 4 days of culture. To test the ability of FHFs to antagonize FGF1 signaling, cells were plated in media as above containing a submaximal concentration of FGF1 (150 pm) plus increasing concentrations of FHF. Growth/viability was quantified as above. All experiments were performed in duplicate.Assays for FHF·IB2 Complex Formation—The DNA fragment encoding residues 226–421 of murine IB2 (numbered according to GenBank™ AF220195) was subcloned into the pET3d bacterial expression vector with an in-frame C-terminal 6× histidine tag. The resulting construct (mIB2226–421) was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Cell pellets were lysed in the presence of 6 m sodium isothiocyanate and loaded onto a nickel-agarose column. The column was washed in denaturing and then nondenaturing buffers, and mIB2226–421 was eluted with 200 mm imidizole. Purified FHF and mIB2226–421 were incubated together at 4 °C for 15 min and then subjected to gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography on an analytical Superdex 75-HR10/30 (Amersham Biosciences). Column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue or silver staining.RESULTSA characteristic biochemical feature of all FGFs studied to date is the ability to interact with heparin. Indeed, this feature has been routinely used for FGF affinity purification (45Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A primary sequence analysis of FHFs indicated that several basic residues in FGFs that are shown to mediate the FGF-heparin interaction are also present in FHFs. Therefore, it was pertinent to check whether FHFs bind heparin and, if so, to utilize this interaction as a tool for affinity purification. As shown in Fig. 1, both FHF1b and FHF4b bound to heparin-Sepharose and were eluted using 0.75 m sodium chloride. The ionic strength required to elute FGF from heparin-Sepharose has been routinely used as a measure of FGF-heparin affinity (46Thompson L.D. Pantoliano M.W. Springer B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3831-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Thus, the affinity of FHFs for heparin is comparable with that of FGF7 and FGF10 (0.75 m) but is significantly lower than that of the FGF1- and FGF2-heparin interaction (1.5 and 1.8 m, respectively). Both FHFs were further purified to homogeneity using ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography.Fig. 1FHFs bind heparin. Bacterially expressed soluble FHF1b and FHF4b samples were analyzed by heparin affinity chromatography. The FHFs were eluted using increasing concentrations of sodium chloride in a step gradient (dashed line). FHF-containing peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining.

To test this possibility, we made use of previously characterized BaF3 lymphoid cell lines, each expressing one of the seven principal FGFR isoforms. These cell lines survive and proliferate in response to FGF/heparin-induced receptor activation (7Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 44Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol.

Each cell line was tested for viability in response to FHF concentrations ranging up to 12.5 nm using an MTT assay (Fig. 2, A–G). Whereas FGF1 had significant activity toward all receptors at concentrations as low as 300 pm, FHFs had no activity at all tested concentrations.Fig. 2FHFs do not interact with FGFRs. A–G, assays for FHF activation of FGFRs. BaF3 cells expressing each of the seven FGFRs were plated in medium containing 5 μg/ml heparin and increasing concentrations of FHFs or FGF1 as a control. Viable cells were quantitated 4 days later by MTT assay, and data are expressed as percentage of maximum MTT values achieved with highest concentration of FGF1. H, FHFs do not antagonize FGF-FGFR interaction. BaF3 cells expressing FGFR1-IIIb were cultured with FGF1 (150 pm) and increasing concentrations of FHF1b or FHF4b. Data are expressed as percentage of MTT value attained with 3 nm FGF1 in the absence of FHFs. MTT values for treatment with different FGF1 concentrations alone (expressed as log10m) are indicated on the left. ♦, FGF1; ▴, FHF1b; ▵, FHF4b. Experiments for A–H were performed in duplicate and include error bars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The failure of FHFs to activate any FGFR despite significant homology with FGFs at the receptor binding residues left open the possibility that FHFs may have evolved to antagonize FGF signaling. To assay for receptor antagonism, FHFs at concentrations ranging up to 12.5 nm were tested for their ability to antagonize viability/proliferation mediated by a threshold concentration of FGF1 (150 pm). Fig. 2H shows data for the BaF-FGFR1-IIIb cell line, which is representative of all cell lines tested, and demonstrates that FHFs fail to antagonize FGF1 activity. Taken together, these data substantiate the premise that FHFs are functionally unrelated to FGFs.FHFs Interact Directly with the Cytoplasmic Protein IB2— Multiple isoforms of FHF1, FHF2, and FHF4 (FGF14) have been shown to form intracellular complexes with IB2 (35Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). 2D. M. Ornitz and M. Goldfarb, unpublished data. The FHF-IB2 interaction requires the presence of both FGF core homology region and the C-terminal tail of FHF and a 260-residue long segment (residues 212–471) of murine IB2 not shared by the related scaffold IB1 (JIP-1b) (35Schoorlemmer J. Goldfarb M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 793-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In more recent studies, we have shown that a shorter fragment of this region consisting of residues 226–421 is sufficient for FHF binding. 3S. K. Olsen, M. Garbi, N. Zampieri, A. V. Eliseenkova, D. M. Ornitz, M. Goldfarb, and M. Mohammadi, unpublished results.To determine whether the FHF-IB2 interaction is direct, the IB2 fragment consisting of residues 226–421 was expressed as a His6-tagged fusion protein (mIB2226–421) in E. coli and purified using Ni+ chelating chromatography. FHF1b or FHF4b (10 μm) were preincubated with or without an excess of mIB2226–421 (28 μm) and chromatographed through a gel filtration column, and fraction aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 3, A–D, shows that each FHF alone has a long column retention time, whereas in the presence of added mIB2226–421, each FHF more rapidly co-elutes with the added IB2. To confirm the requirement for the C-terminal tail of FHF1b for IB2 binding, we also expressed and purified a C-terminally truncated version of FHF1b and tested the capacity of this construct (FH"

Thus far, three isoforms of SCD (SCD1, SCD2, and SCD3) have been identified and characterized. Regulation of the SCD1 isoform has been shown to be an important component of the metabolic actions of leptin in liver, but the effects of leptin on SCD isoforms in other tissues have not been investigated. We found that although the mRNA levels of SCD1 and SCD2 were not affected by leptin deficiency in the hearts of ob/ob mice, the SCD activity and levels of monounsaturated fatty acids were increased, implying the existence of another SCD isoform. This observation has led to the cDNA cloning and characterization of a fourth SCD isoform (SCD4) that is expressed exclusively in the heart. SCD4 encodes a 352-amino acid protein that shares 79% sequence identity with the SCD1, SCD2, and SCD3 isoforms. Liver X receptor α (LXRα) agonists and a high carbohydrate fat-free diet induced SCD4 expression, but unlike SCD1, SCD4 expression was not repressed by dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids. SCD4 mRNA levels were elevated 5-fold in the hearts of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice relative to wild type controls. Treatment of ob/ob mice with leptin decreased mRNA levels of SCD4, whereas levels of SCD1 and SCD2 were not affected. Furthermore, in the hearts of SCD1-deficient mice, SCD4 mRNA levels were induced 3-fold, whereas the levels of SCD2 were not altered.

This reaction involves the introduction of a cis-double bond in the Δ-9 position (between carbons 9 and 10) in a spectrum of methylene-interrupted fatty acyl-CoAs. The preferred substrates are palmitoyl- and stearoyl-CoAs, which are desaturated into palmitoleoyl- and oleoyl-CoA, respectively (1Miyazaki M. Ntambi J.M. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 2003; 68: 113-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 2Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1549-1558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The roles of monounsaturated fatty acids are diverse and crucial in living organisms. Palmitoleic and oleic acids are the major monounsaturated fatty acids in membrane phospholipids, triglycerides, and cholesterol esters (3Miyazaki M. Kim Y.C. Gray-Keller M.P. Attie A.D. Ntambi J.M.

Apart from being components of lipids, monounsaturated fatty acids have also been implicated as mediators in signal transduction and differentiation of neurons and other cells (6Garbay B.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Given the multiple roles of monounsaturated fatty acids, alterations in stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity in mammals would be expected to have potent effects on lipid metabolism and to play a role in the propensity to develop obesity, atherosclerosis, and metabolic diseases (1Miyazaki M.

SCD1 is the main isoform expressed in mouse liver, whereas SCD2 is constitutively expressed in the brain (8Ntambi J.M. Buhrow S.A. Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Sibley E. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J.

Nutr. 2001; 131: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar).We recently found that the regulation of SCD1 by leptin plays a crucial role in signaling the body to either store fat or burn it. Obese mice, which lack leptin, lost weight because of increased energy expenditure when genetically crossed with a strain of mice carrying a mutation in SCD1 (5Cohen P. Miyazaki M. Socci N.D. Hagge-Greenberg A. Liedtke W. Soukas A.A. Sharma R. Hudgins L.C. Ntambi J.M. Friedman J.M. Science. 2002; 297: 240-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The missing SCD1 enzyme also corrected a major clinical problem called fatty liver, which is found in obese mice and humans. Leptin has also been found to reduce fat deposition in other tissues such as muscle and heart (28Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.-B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G.D. Muller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B.

Med. 2002; 53: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), but the role of SCD in mediating the effects of leptin in these tissues has not been established.We report here the isolation of a fourth SCD isoform and have studied its tissue distribution and nutritional regulation. The new SCD isoform, designated SCD4, encodes a 352-amino acid protein and is expressed exclusively in the heart. SCD4 mRNA levels are elevated in hearts of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and reduced in leptin-treated ob/ob mice. The mRNA levels of SCD1 and SCD2 isoforms in hearts of ob/ob mice are not affected by either leptin deficiency or leptin treatment. LXRα agonists and a high carbohydrate fat-free diet induce the expression of SCD1 and SCD4, but unlike SCD1, SCD4 expression is not repressed when the high carbohydrate diet is supplemented with polyunsaturated fatty acids. The current studies demonstrate that SCD4 is a nutritionally regulated heart-specific SCD isoform that is a target of leptin action.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and Diets—Male C57BL6J and ob/ob mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). 129S6/SvEv mice were purchased from Taconic (Germantown, NY). The mice (14–16 weeks old) were maintained on a 12-h dark/light cycle and were fed a normal nonpurified diet (5008 test diet; PMI Nutrition International Inc., Richmond, IN), a high carbohydrate fat-free diet (TD99252, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI), or high carbohydrate fat-free diet supplemented with fish oil. In some experiments the chow diet was supplemented with 0.025% T0901317, an LXRα agonist (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI), which was fed to the mice for 2 days. All animal breeding was in accordance with protocols approved by the animal care research committee of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.Materials—Radioactive [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from DuPont. Thin layer chromatography plates (TLC Silica Gel G60) were from Merck. [14C]Stearoyl-CoA and [14C]palmitoyl-CoA were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The cDNA probes for SCD1 and SCD2 have been previously described (15Gomez F.E. Miyazaki M. Kim Y.C. Marwah P. Lardy H.A. Ntambi J.M. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5473-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma.Subcutaneous Leptin Treatment—ob/ob mice were individually caged and allowed to acclimate for a number of days prior to the start of the experiment. The mice were treated with 200 ng/h of recombinant mouse leptin (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) and PBS for 12 days using subcutaneously placed Alzet miniosmotic pumps model 1002 (AlZa Co., Palo Alto, CA) as previously described (27Soukas A. Cohen P. Socci N.D. Friedman J.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 963-980PubMed Google Scholar). As an additional control, a group of mice referred to as pair-fed was treated with PBS and given the same amount of food to eat as leptin-treated mice voluntarily consumed. All of the data presented were generated from this or a similar time course where mice were either treated with PBS or leptin for 12 days. Body mass and food intake were measured daily.Isolation and Analysis of RNA—Total RNA was extracted from the hearts of 5 ob/ob male C57BL6 and SCD1–/– mice as well as the appropriate wild type controls using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) (14Miyazaki M. Gomez F.E. Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2146-2154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, 15 μg of total RNA were separated by 1.0% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes.Cloning and Expression of the Mouse SCD4 cDNA—A BLAST search of the mouse genomic data base identified a gene with exon sequences highly homologous to the amino acid sequence of mouse SCD1, 2, and 3 (GenBank™ accession numbers AH_002082, M26270, and AF272037, respectively). Using the genomic sequence, a candidate open reading frame of the putative SCD4 was cloned by synthesizing a forward and a reverse primer. The primers were utilized to screen total RNA isolated from the hearts of SCD1–/– mice by PCR amplification. The amplification conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min and finally 1 cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the T-easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. The construct was named pTA-mSCD4. The 5′ upstream and 3′ downstream regions of the SCD4 cDNA that were missing from pTA-SCD4 were obtained by a SMART™ RACE kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using the primers 5′-TCCTGCTGTCTCCGGGAGTGGGGTTCCA-3′ and 5′-TTGGCCAACCTCCCCAAGGCTTCACAGC-3′, respectively. The 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE products were cloned in the T-easy vector and then sequenced. The complete SCD4 cDNA was then obtained using the forward primer (5′-ACAGCAGAACTGACTGGTGACACCTGCACAGTTAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CCGAGAGCGCTCTTGAATAAAAAAATCCTCTTGC-3′) and then sequenced. A Multiple Tissue Northern blot (Clontech, catalog number 7762-1) was used to detect SCD4 expression in mouse heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney. The EcoRI-StyI fragment (186 bp) of the 5′-RACE product of SCD4 was used as the probe. It was tested against SCD1, 2, and 3 there was no cross-hybridization. The specific probes for SCD1, SCD2, and SCD3 derived from the 5′-untranslated region have been previously described (13Miyazaki M. Kim H.J. Man W.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39455-39461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For additional tissues, RT-PCR was performed using the SCD4 primers 5′-AGGATGGAGAAGAGAAGATGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGTTGTTTTATGGAACAGAGACCC-3′ (reverse). SCD4 primers for quantitative RT-PCR are 5′-GCTCTCTCTGCCTTCACAAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTTCCTCCAGACGTACTCCAGCTT-3′ (reverse). Real time quantitative PCR using SCD1-, SCD2-, SCD3-, cyclophilin-, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific primers was performed as previously described (14Miyazaki M. Gomez F.E. Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2146-2154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).To introduce an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag into the cytomegalovirus promoter of the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen), PCR was performed with pTA-mSCD4 as the template, using a forward primer (TTGAATTCACCATGTACCCATATGACGTCCCGGACTACGCCATGACGGCCCACTTGCCAC) and a reverse primer (5′-TTGCTCGAGTCAGCTACTCTTGTGACTCCC-3′). The EcoRI-XhoI fragment of the PCR product was ligated into pcDNA3, and the construct was named pcDNA3-HAmSCD4. HEK-293 (ATCC) cells were plated on 10-cm plates in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. After 24 h, at 80–90% confluence, the cells were transfected with 10 μg of SCD4 expression vector or pcDNA3, using 60 μl of SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). 36 h after transfection, the cells were harvested, and the microsomes were isolated. Expression of HA-tagged SCD4 protein in microsomes was determined by immunoblot analysis. Microsomal protein (10 μg) was electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked at room temperature for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with 100 ng/ml anti-HA monoclonal antibody (clone 3F10; Roche Applied Science) in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG at a 1:20000 dilution (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Visualization was performed with an ECL Western blot detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).Enzyme Assays—Microsomes were isolated from hearts of ob/ob mice as well as from HEK-293 cells by differential centrifugation and suspended in a 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity was assayed at 23 °C with 3 μm [14C]stearoyl-CoA or [14C]palmitoyl-CoA, 2 mm NADH, and 100 μg of microsomal protein. After 5 min of incubation, 200 μl of 2.5 m KOH in 75% ethanol was added, and the reaction mixture was saponified at 85 °C for 1 h. The samples were cooled and acidified with 280 μl of formic acid. Free fatty acids were extracted with 700 μl of hexane and separated on a 10% AgNO3-impregnated TLC plate using chloroform:methanol:acetic acid: H2O (90:8:1:0.8). The TLC plates were analyzed with Instant Imager (Packard, Meriden, CT) overnight.Fatty Acid Analysis—Total lipids were extracted from the hearts or HEK cells according to the method of Bligh and Dyer as previously described (14Miyazaki M. Gomez F.E. Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2146-2154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The fatty acids were quantitated by GLC as described (13Miyazaki M. Kim H.J. Man W.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39455-39461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Pentadecanoic acid (Sigma) was added as an internal standard for the quantitation of fatty acids.RESULTSFig. 1 shows a Northern blot of total RNA isolated from hearts of ob/ob mice and wild type controls measuring the levels of SCD1 and SCD2. SCD1 and SCD2 mRNA levels were similar between wild type and ob/ob mice (Fig. 1, A and B). However, the SCD activity (Fig. 1C) and levels of C16:1 and C18:1 monounsaturated fatty acids, the major SCD products, were significantly elevated in ob/ob hearts (Fig. 1D), which first suggested the presence of another SCD isoform that was induced in the heart by leptin deficiency.We searched the mouse genomic DNA data base (www.genomic.ucsc.edu) for other mouse SCD homologues, using the amino acid sequences of other members of the mouse SCD family. A predicted cDNA sequence with a 78–86% similarity to the other SCD isoforms was identified. We designed specific primers for the predicted SCD cDNA and used them in a PCR analysis to screen cDNAs prepared from total RNA isolated from hearts of mice with a targeted disruption in the SCD1 isoform (SCD1–/–). SCD1–/– mice were used to minimize cross-reactivity of the primers with SCD1 sequences expressed in wild type mice. The PCR product was sequenced, and the missing 5′- and 3′-untranslated region sequences were obtained by 5′- and 3′-RACE. The resulting cDNA had an inframe termination codon 248 nucleotides upstream of the putative methionine initiator codon, suggesting that the entire open reading frame had been obtained, and it was designated SCD4.The gene structure, predicted amino acid sequence and hydrophobicity plots of the mouse SCD4 cDNA and protein are shown in Fig. 2. The sequence of the gene obtained by BLAST analysis of the mouse genome resources of UCSC as well as sequence from two isolated BAC clones revealed that the mouse SCD4 spans 14 kb and has 6 exons and 5 introns (Fig. 2A). The open reading frame that terminates in exon 6 predicts a 353-amino acid protein with a theoretical molecular mass of 41 kDa sharing ∼83% nucleotide homology with the other three SCD isoforms. Amino acid sequence alignment of SCD4 with SCD1, SCD2, and SCD3 indicates sequence identity of greater than 77% and includes 100% conservation of the three histidine motifs HRLWSH, HRAHH, and HNYHH that exist in other desaturases (Fig. 2B). The hydropathy plot shows that the SCD4 protein possesses four transmembrane domains (Fig. 2C), similar to other SCD isoforms.Fig. 2Structure of mouse SCD4. A, gene structure of mouse SCD4. B, amino acid sequence alignment of SCD4 and mouse SCD1, SCD2, and SCD3. The amino acid sequence of SCD4 was deduced from cDNA sequence. The nonconserved amino acids are shaded in gray. The three HXXHH motifs that are 100% conserved are shaded in black. The transmembrane domain amino acids are underlined. C, Kyte and Doolittle hydropathy plot of mouse SCD4. The residue-specific hydropathy index was calculated over a window of 18 amino acids using DNA STAR software version 5.0.

Immunoblot analysis with an HA antibody showed that SCD4 protein was expressed in the microsomal fractions (Fig. 3A), migrating at a molecular mass of ∼41 kDa similar to other SCD isoforms. SCD activity was measured in isolated membranes and compared with HEK-293 cells transfected with empty vector alone (pcDNA3). Fig. 3B and the densitometric quantitation (Fig. 3C) shows that SCD activity using 18:0 as a substrate was increased 8-fold in microsomes from pcDNA3-HA-mSCD4 transfected cells compared with cells transfected with empty vector alone (pcDNA3). SCD activity was increased 3-fold when 16:0 was used as substrate (data not shown).Fig. 3Expression of HA-tagged mouse SCD4 in membrane fractions of transfected HEK-293 cells. A, cultured HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with a HA-tagged SCD4 cDNA expression plasmid (pcDNA3-HA-mSCD4) or the vector alone (pcDNA3). After 48 h the cells were harvested, and the membrane fractions were isolated. Aliquots (30 μg) of membranes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with 1:500 dilution of an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. The filter was exposed to film for 5 s at room temperature. B, SCD enzyme activity. Microsomes were prepared from HEK-293 cells that had been transfected with pcDNA3-HA-SCD4 or pcDNA3 expression vectors, and SCD enzyme activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of radioactivity in oleoyl-CoA using [1-14C]stearoyl-CoA as a substrate. Liver microsomes that have a high SCD activity were used as a control. The reaction products were separated by TLC, and the radioactivity was quantitated in C. **, p < 0.001 versus pcDNA3 (Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the tissue expression pattern of SCD4, a commercially prepared filter (Clontech) containing 2 μg of poly(A+) RNA from several mouse tissues was hybridized with the SCD4-specific probe. Additional RNA isolated from other tissues (brown adipose, white adipose, and Harderian gland) was analyzed by RT-PCR using SCD4-specific primers. The Northern blot (Fig. 4A) and RT-PCR analysis of additional tissues (Fig. 4B) show that the heart is the only tissue expressing SCD4. SCD1 is most abundantly expressed in liver, lung, and kidney, whereas SCD2 is mainly expressed in brain, lung, and testis. SCD3 was expressed only in the Harderian gland (data not shown). The 3.1-kb mRNA transcript was the predominant species of SCD4, with two minor transcripts (2.8 and 1.5) that probably arise from the use of multiple GAAA repeats within exon 6 as cleavage sites for the addition of polyadenylate. The SCD4 mRNA is thus smaller than the 4.9 kb of the other SCD isoforms, because of a shorter 3′-untranslated region.Fig. 4Tissue distribution of SCD4 mRNA. A, commercial blot containing poly(A+) mRNA from eight mouse tissues were hybridized to 32P-labeled SCD1-, SCD2-, and SCD4-specific probes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The blots were stripped and rehybridized with a β-actin probe to indicate the presence of mRNA in each lane. A 3.1-kb major transcript and a 1.5-kb minor transcript were detected only in the heart. B, RT-PCR of additional mouse tissues.

These effects are thought to be mediated, respectively, through SREBP-1c induction by insulin and inhibition of SREBP-1c expression and protein maturation by polyunsaturated fatty acids (18Repa J.J.

To determine whether SCD4, like SCD1, is regulated by a high carbohydrate fat-free diet and polyunsaturated fatty acids and by the LXRα agonist T0901317, 129SV mice were fed either a high carbohydrate fat-free diet or a chow diet containing 0.025% T0901317. As shown in Fig. 5A, the high carbohydrate fat-free diet induced the expression of SCD1 and SCD4 without a noticeable effect on SCD2. Supplementation of the high carbohydrate fat-free diet with fish oil, a rich source of polyunsaturated fatty acids, repressed expression of SCD1 and SCD2, to a smaller extent, but had no effect on SCD4 levels (Fig. 5B). SCD1, SCD2, and SCD4 were induced by the LXRα agonist 18-, 12-, and 60-fold, respectively (Fig. 5C). These experiments illustrate the tissue-specific modulation of the SCD isoforms by particular dietary factors.Fig. 5Regulation of SCD4 by high carbohydrate fat-free diet, polyunsaturated fatty acids and LXRα agonist. The mice were fed the following diets. A, a high carbohydrate fat-free diet (CHO-FF). B, high carbohydrate fat-free diet supplemented with fish oil (CHO-FO) that was fed for 4 days. C, chow diet supplemented with the LXRα agonist T0901317 (LXR) and fed for 2 days.

Each proteasome particle contains two chymotrypsin-like, two trypsin-like, and two caspase-like proteolytic sites. Previous studies suggest a complex network of allosteric interactions between these catalytic and multiple regulatory sites. We used positional scanning combinatorial substrate libraries to determine the extended substrate specificity of the caspase-like sites. Based on this analysis, several new substrates were synthesized, the use of which confirmed earlier observations that caspase-like sites (often termed postglutamyl peptide hydrolase) cleave after aspartates better than after glutamates. Highly selective inhibitors of the caspase-like sites were also generated. They stimulated trypsin-like activity of yeast 20 S proteasomes up to 3-fold but not when binding of the inhibitor to the caspase-like sites was prevented in a mutant carrying an uncleaved propeptide. Although substrates of the caspase-like sites allosterically inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity, inhibitors of the caspase-like sites do not affect the chymotrypsin-like sites. Furthermore, when caspase-like sites were occupied by the uncleaved propeptide or inhibitor, their substrates still inhibited the chymotrypsin-like activity. Thus, occupancy of the caspase-like sites stimulates the trypsin-like activity of proteasomes, but substrates of the caspase-like sites inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity by binding to a distinct noncatalytic site.

When these channels are closed, 20 S proteasomes are in a latent state, and peptides added exogenously are hydrolyzed only very slowly. The rate of peptide hydrolysis dramatically increases upon opening of these gated channels. Such opening can be triggered by the ATPases of the 19 S complexes (14Köhler A. Cascio P. Leggett D.S. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) or by PA28/PA26 proteasome activator complexes (15Whitby F.G.

Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Nat. Struct.

Soc. 2000; 122: 1237-1238Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We previously found that hydrophobic peptide substrates of the chymotrypsin-like sites can stimulate peptide hydrolysis by all active sites of the latent 20 S proteasome (5Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Castillo V. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 395-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 16Kisselev A.F. Kaganovich D. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22260-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These effects were shown to involve binding of hydrophobic peptides to a distinct noncatalytic regulatory site and to result from peptide-induced opening of the channel in the α-rings, because opening of the channels in the α-ring by a variety of treatments (e.g. deletions of N-terminal tails of α-subunits, treatment with SDS, and association with PA26 activators or 19 S regulatory complexes) abolished this activation (16Kisselev A.F. Kaganovich D. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22260-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). On the other hand, activation of proteolysis by hydrophobic peptides was reduced by potassium ions at concentrations similar to those found inside cells, through inhibition of spontaneous opening of these channels (16Kisselev A.F. Kaganovich D. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22260-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Another allosteric effect that we uncovered was that the substrates of the caspase-like sites cause a noncompetitive inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like activity (5Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Castillo V. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 395-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Because the K i value for this allosteric inhibition was similar to the K m of these acidic peptides for the caspase-like sites, we concluded that the inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like activity was caused by the binding of these acidic peptides to the caspase-like sites (5Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Castillo V. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 395-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, Myung et al. (19Myung J. Kim K.B. Lindsten K. Dantuma N.P. Crews C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 411-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and Schmidtke et al. (18Schmidtke G. Emch S. Groettrup M. Holzhutter H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22056-22063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were unable to prevent these allosteric effects by blocking the caspase-like site and therefore concluded that acidic peptides inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity by binding to a distinct regulatory site. On the other hand, these investigators used inhibitors of the caspase-like sites that either were weak (18Schmidtke G. Emch S. Groettrup M. Holzhutter H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22056-22063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or showed only moderate selectivity (19Myung J. Kim K.B. Lindsten K. Dantuma N.P. Crews C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 411-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains unclear whether substrates of the caspase-like sites inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity by binding to the caspase-like or a distinct regulatory site(s). In order to study the mechanism of this allosteric inhibition, we here characterize the extended substrate specificity of the caspase-like site and design a peptide analogue inhibitor that matches the sequence of the best substrate. Such an inhibitor could be used to probe interactions between the caspase-like and trypsin-like sites. Positional scanning substrate libraries have proven to be useful tools to define the specificity of “classical” proteolytic enzymes including caspases (20Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P.

These studies led to the design of selective substrates and inhibitors of different caspases (20Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M.

Recently, these libraries have been used to study the specificity of proteasomes and its modulation by different PA28 activators (24Harris J.L. Alper P.B. Li J. Rechstainer M. Bakes B.J. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), but without assigning cleavage patterns to individual active sites. To address the specificity of the individual active sites, Nazif and Bogyo (25Nazif T. Bogyo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2967-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) used positional scanning irreversible inhibitor libraries with the vinyl sulfone pharmacophore. This approach, although it led to the development of selective inhibitors of the trypsin-like sites, is limited from a synthetic point of view, because it can use only 2 amino acids, glutamine and asparagine, in the P1 position. In this study, we use positional scanning libraries, in combination with subunit-selective inhibitors, to define further the specificity of the individual active sites of proteasome. Specifically, we defined substrate-binding preferences of the caspase-like sites in proteasomes and then designed several improved substrates and inhibitors of the caspase-like sites. Application of these inhibitors led to the discovery of novel allosteric interactions between the caspaseand trypsin-like sites and resolved whether the inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like activity by acidic peptides involves their binding to the caspase-like sites. Enzymes and Inhibitors—20 and 26 S proteasomes from rabbit muscle and 20 S particles (wild type and β1T1A mutant) from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strains SUB61 and MHY1157, respectively) were purified as described previously (16Kisselev A.F. Kaganovich D. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22260-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recombinant human caspase-1, -3, and -8 were produced and purified as described (26Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Zamboni R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A.

YU102 (Ac-GPFL-ex) was purchased from Affinity Research Products (Exeter, UK). NLVS was a kind gift of Dr. Matt Bogyo (University of California San Francisco), and AEBSF (Pefablock SC) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Fluorogenic substrates of proteasome (except those synthesized in this study) and caspases were from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA). Protected amino acids used in substrate and inhibitor synthesis were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (La Jolla, CA) or Advanced ChemTech (Louisville, KY).

Under these conditions, the final concentration of each individual compound was ∼0.25 μm. Production of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) was monitored as described (20Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

In some experiments, proteasomes were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 μm NLVS and 0.5 mm AEBSF to inactivate the chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like sites, respectively. Synthesis of Substrates—The P4-P2 portion of all substrates was synthesized using Fmoc-based solid phase peptide synthesis on the Wang resin. After acidic cleavage (trifluoroacetic acid/CH2Cl2), the P4-P2 portions were condensed with either Asp(OtBu)-amc, Glu(OtBu)-amc, or Leu-amc under the agency of PyBOP and diisopropylethylamine, followed by final acidic deprotection (in case of Asp and Glu) to give, after preparative HPLC, the desired fluorogenic substrates. Asp(OtBu)-amc, Glu(OtBu)-amc, and Leu-amc were prepared as described by Knight (27Knight C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 18-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Synthesis of Peptide Aldehyde Inhibitors—Peptides Ac-APnL and Z-PnL were synthesized on a solid phase using standard Fmoc-based peptide chemistry (28Wellings D.A. Atherton E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 289: 44-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A fully protected semicarbazone derivative of Asp-al, Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-semicarbazone, was prepared from Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-COOH using Weinreb amide methodology (29Loidl G. Musiol H.J. Groll M. Huber R. Moroder L. J. Pept. Sci. 2000; 6: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), after which the Fmoc group was removed by a 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene/octanethiol mixture as described (30Sheppeck J.A. Kar H. Hong H. Tetrahedron Lett. 2000; 41: 5329-5333Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The P4-P2 peptide fragments were coupled to Asp(OtBu)-semicarbazone in solution as described (31Kessler B.M. Tortorella D. Altun M. Kisselev A.F. Fiebiger E. Hekking B.G. Ploegh H.L. Overkleeft H.S. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 913-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The tBu protecting group was removed by a 25% solution of trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane (32Cardozo C. Chen W.E. Wilk S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The semicarbazone group was removed by a mixture of methanol, acetic acid, and formaldehyde (32Cardozo C. Chen W.E. Wilk S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The resulting aldehydes were purified to homogeneity by preparative HPLC. The structure of all inhibitors synthesized was confirmed by NMR and mass spectrometry. Assays of Proteasome Activity—The cleavage of fluorogenic peptide substrates was measured in 96-well plates by continuously monitoring the fluorescence of the reaction product (free AMC). The rates of reaction were determined from the slopes of the resulting reaction progress curves. 20 S proteasome activity was assayed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The buffer used for assays of 26 S proteasomes also contained 40 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP or AMP-PNP, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Proteasomes from rabbit muscle were assayed at 37 °C, and yeast proteasomes were assayed at 30 °C. PA26 was always present at a 4-fold molar excess over 20 S proteasomes. Measuring K i of Peptide Aldehyde Inhibitors—Proteasomes were added to a 100 μm solution of Ac-nLPnLD-amc containing different concentrations of inhibitors. Steady state rates in the presence (V i) or absence (Vo) of inhibitor were determined from the slopes of the reaction progress curves. Apparent K i (K i(app)) was determined as the reciprocal slope of the plot of V o/V i against the concentration of the inhibitor according to the equation V o/V i = 1 + [S]/K i(app). True K i was then determined from the following equation: K i = K i(app)/(1 + [S]/K m). Inhibition of caspase-1, -3, and -8 by Z-PnLD-al and Ac-APnLD-al was monitored using continuous fluorometric assays as described (33Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D.

Briefly, appropriate dilutions of enzyme were combined with K m concentrations of substrate in the absence or presence of several concentrations of the inhibitor of interest, in a total volume of 100 μl. Liberation of AMC was monitored for up to 1 h at room temperature. The assay was conducted in a buffer containing 100 mm HEPES, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. The substrates used were Ac-WEHD-amc for caspase-1 and Ac-DEVD-amc for caspase-3 and caspase-8. Reaction rates were fit by nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation for competitive inhibition to obtain a value for the inhibition constant K i. Characterization of the Specificity of the Caspase-like Site by Position-scanning Libraries—Positional scanning synthetic combinatorial libraries (PS-SCL) of general structure Ac-X-X-X-Asp-amc (20Thornberry N.A.

Thornberry N.A. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 149-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) were developed and successfully used to map the specificity of caspases in the P2–P4 positions. Since proteasomes can cleave standard caspase substrates (5Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Castillo V. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 395-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), we used these libraries to characterize the specificity of the caspase-like sites in the proteasomes. This PS-SCL is composed of three separate sublibraries (P2, P3, and P4). In each sublibrary, one position is defined with one of 20 amino acids, whereas the remaining two positions contain approximately equimolar mixtures of all amino acids (20Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). 20 S proteasomes from rabbit muscle were incubated simultaneously with all three sublibraries (20 samples each) in a 96-well plate, and the cleavage of the Asp-amc bond was followed by monitoring the fluorescence of released AMC. This analysis revealed that in the P2 position, the caspase-like sites in proteasomes strongly prefer bulky hydrophobic residues (Nle, Phe, Trp, Tyr, and Leu) (Fig. 1a). This finding is surprising, because the x-ray diffraction of yeast proteasome did not reveal a pronounced substrate-binding pocket for the P2 residue in any active site of the yeast or archaeal proteasomes (4Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar, 8Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Cleavages after most other amino acid residues, except Pro and Asp, were also observed, but they occurred at lower rates. In the P3 position (Fig. 1b), nonaromatic hydrophobic (Leu, Nle, and Pro) and Ala residues were preferred, whereas Asp and Lys caused significantly lower cleavage rates. Proteasomes showed low selectivity for the P4 position of the substrate (Fig. 1c). In order to confirm that these cleavages were performed by the caspase-like site, we repeated the screen after inactivation of the chymotrypsin-like site with the irreversible inhibitor NLVS (16Kisselev A.F. Kaganovich D. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22260-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The trypsin-like sites were simultaneously inactivated with another irreversible inhibitor, AEBSF (36Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). When these sites were inactive (NLVSand AEBSF-treated proteasomes cleaved standard substrates of chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like sites at 2–5% of the control rates), the pattern of selectivity against this library (Fig. 1, d–f) was not different from that of the control proteasomes (Fig. 1, a–c). Therefore, the great majority of cleavages in this library are indeed performed by the caspase-like sites. Interestingly, NLVSand AEBSF-treated proteasomes cleaved libraries at 2-fold higher rates than control particles (Fig. 1). This observation is surprising, because we have previously shown that treatment of proteasomes with NLVS and AEBSF does not enhance the caspase-like activity (16Kisselev A.F. Kaganovich D. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22260-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 36Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3363-3371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In the previous study, preincubation of proteasomes with these irreversible inhibitors was followed by the removal of the excess of the unreacted inhibitor by dilution or dialysis. In the present study, concentrations of inhibitors were not reduced prior to the addition of substrates. Hydrophobic peptides stimulate peptide hydrolysis by the caspase-like site and two other sites by binding to the noncatalytic sites (16Kisselev A.F. Kaganovich D. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22260-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Because NLVS is hydrophobic (it contains 3 leucine residues), we tested whether NLVS can also enhance substrate hydrolysis by the caspase-like sites by reversible binding to the noncatalytic sites. When we removed excess NLVS by dilution or dialysis so that only NLVS irreversibly attached to the chymotrypsin-like sites remained, no activation of the caspase-like sites was observed (16Kisselev A.F. Kaganovich D. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22260-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). When 1 μm NLVS (same concentration as used in the experiments on Fig. 1) was added back to the mixture of substrates and proteasomes with blocked chymotrypsin-like sites, it still stimulated cleavage of substrates by the caspase-like sites 2-fold (data not shown). Thus, enhanced rates of library cleavage in the presence of NLVS and AEBSF are due to binding of NLVS to the noncatalytic regulatory sites. These studies were performed with latent 20 S proteasomes in which the gates in the α-rings are largely in the closed conformation. Consequently, in these particles, substrate entry through this channel rather than their hydrolysis at the active sites is the rate-limiting step (16Kisselev A.F. Kaganovich D. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22260-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the results of the screen were affected by difference in substrate access to the proteolytic chamber, we repeated this analysis under several conditions where the channels are mainly in an open state. Screens were performed in the presence of 0.01% SDS or the hydrophobic peptides, Suc-FLF-mna and Suc-LLVY-mna, both of which trigger gate opening (16Kisselev A.F. Kaganovich D. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22260-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As expected, the overall activity of the proteasomes increased considerably, but similar patterns of substrate preference were found (data not shown). Thus, the original s"

Intracellularly, at least two enzymes, sphingosine kinase and S1P phosphatase, regulate the activity of S1P by governing the phosphorylation status of S1P. To study the regulation of S1P levels, we cloned the human isoform of S1P phosphatase 1 (hSPPase1). The hSPPase1 has 78% homology to the mouse SPPase at the amino acid level with 6–8 possible transmembrane domains. Confocal microscopy revealed green fluorescent protein-tagged hSPPase1, expressed in either MCF7 or HEK293 cells, co-localized to endoplasmic reticulum with calreticulin. According to Northern blot analysis, hSPPase1 is expressed in most tissues, with the strongest levels found in the highly vascular tissues of placenta and kidney. Transient overexpression of hSPPase1 exhibited a 2-fold increase in phosphatase activity against S1P and dihydro-S1P, indicating that the expressed protein was functional. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of endogenous hSPPase1 drastically reduced hSPPase1 mRNA levels, as confirmed by reverse transcription PCR, and resulted in an overall 25% reduction of in vitro phosphatase activity in the membrane fractions. Sphingolipid mass measurements in hSPPase1 siRNA knockdown cells revealed a 2-fold increase of S1P levels and concomitant decrease in sphingosine. In vivo labeling of hSPPase1 siRNA-treated cells showed accumulation of S1P within cells, as well as significantly increased secretion of S1P into the media, indicating that hSPPase1 regulates secreted S1P. In addition, siRNA-induced knockdown of hSPPase1 endowed resistance to tumor necrosis factor-α and the chemotherapeutic agent daunorubicin. Collectively, these data suggest that regulation of hSPPase1 with the resultant changes in cellular and secreted S1P could have important implications to cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis.

In addition, siRNA-induced knockdown of hSPPase1 endowed resistance to tumor necrosis factor-α and the chemotherapeutic agent daunorubicin. Collectively, these data suggest that regulation of hSPPase1 with the resultant changes in cellular and secreted S1P could have important implications to cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) 1The abbreviations used are: S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate; SPPase, S1P phosphatase; hSPPase, human isoform of S1P phosphatase; mSPPase, mouse amino acid sequence for sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor; ORF, open reading frame; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. is a highly bioactive sphingolipid implicated in a variety of intracellular signaling events that regulate such cellular functions as differentiation, proliferation, migration, cytoskeletal reorganization, senescence, and apoptosis (1Hannun Y.A.

Intracellularly, S1P may act as a second messenger on undefined targets, or S1P may act extracellularly through binding to its G-protein-coupled receptors of the endothelial differentiation gene family (S1P receptors-(1–5)) (6Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The emergence of S1P as an important signaling molecule raises the question of how S1P levels are regulated to synchronize S1P-mediated cell signaling events. S1P is generated by sphingosine kinase phopshorylating sphingosine and is dephosphorylated by S1P phosphatase 1 (SPPase1). Additionally, S1P may be degraded by S1P lyase into hexadecenal and phosphoethanolamine. Evidence for the existence of sphingoid base-specific phosphatases was put forth by Van Veldhoven et al. (7Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using cultured skin fibroblasts and rat liver (7Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P.

Subsequently, utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based genetic manipulation, yeast sphingoid base-specific phosphatase enzymes (Ysr2p/Lbp1p/Lcb3p and Ysr3p/Lbp2p) were identified (9Mao C. Wadleigh M.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1134-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ultimately, these findings led to the cloning of both the murine and the human SPPase (12Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Galve-Roperh I.

The mammalian SPPases are a part of the type 2 lipid phosphate phosphatases that are magnesium-independent, N-ethylmaleimide insensitive, and contain several transmembrane domains (12Mandala S.M.

Additionally, these SPPases contain the three conserved motifs: 1) KXXXXXXRP, 2) SXH, and 3) SRXXXXXHXXXD found in the superfamily of type 2 lipid phosphate phosphatases believed to constitute the site of enzymatic activity (15Stuckey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These mammalian SPPases exhibit substrate specificity against sphingoid base 1-phosphates, including S1P, dihydro-S1P, and phyto-S1P (12Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Galve-Roperh I. Poulton S. Peterson C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 1268-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Despite the availability of yeast and mammalian SPPases, little is known about their physiologic function. Studies in S. cerevisiae indicate a possible role for Ysr2 in the uptake and transport of long-chain bases (9Mao C. Wadleigh M. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28690-28694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These studies also indicate that Ysr2 has a role in S. cerevisiae cell cycle regulation and thermotolerance such that overexpression of YSR2 caused cell cycle arrest and its disruption endowed thermotolerance (16Mao C. Saba J.D. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As for the role of mammalian SPPase, studies performed with overexpression of the murine enzyme demonstrated an increase in cellular levels of ceramide and enhancement of apoptosis (17Le Stunff H. Galve-Roperh I. Peterson C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, because these studies relied on overexpressed enzyme it is yet to be determined what the physiologic role of the endogenous enzyme is. In addition because S1P also functions extracellularly on its cell surface receptor it is not yet known if SPPase regulates extracellular levels of S1P. In fact we have recently demonstrated that sphigosine kinase can regulate S1P secretion (18Johnson K.R. Becker K.P. Facchinetti M.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35257-35262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In this study we identified the human SPPase1 homologue that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and possesses enzymatic activity toward S1P and dihydro-S1P. Northern blot analysis revealed hSPPase1 to be expressed in a variety of tissues with the highest levels occurring in the highly vascular tissues of the kidney and placenta. Enforced knockdown of endogenous hSPPase1 by siRNA resulted in a 2-fold increase of S1P within the cells with a concomitant decrease of sphingosine levels, as well as a significant increase of S1P secretion. In addition, knockdown of hSPPase1 resulted in significant resistance to growth inhibition induced by either cytotoxic agents tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or daunorubicin. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time a physiologic function of endogenous hSPPase1 in the regulation of cellular and secreted S1P levels and its role in apoptosis. Cell Culture—HEK293 (ATCC CRL-1573) and MCF-7 (ATCC HTB-22) cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium or RPMI 1640, respectively, containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA Cloning—A tBLASTn search using the mouse amino acid sequence for sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase (mSPPase1), identified several human expressed sequence tag clones with homology to the mouse 3′ sequence: 35435 (GenBank™ accession number AA331563), 374988 (AW962915), 375872 (AW963799), and 367286 (AW955216). A similar tBLASTn search scanning the human genomic sequence data bank revealed several regions of chromosome 14q23 (clone R-804M7, RPCI-11 BAC library, AL161670), with high homology to the mSSPase1. Using PCR-based cloning strategies, we used primers P5 (5′-GCTCCATTCATCATCATCGG-3′) and P6 (5′-ATAGAATTCTCAAGAGATACCAATAAAGAAAAATATGT) to clone a 456-bp fragment from the 3′-region of the proposed open reading frame (ORF) for human SPPase using human fetal kidney Marathon-ready cDNA (Clontech). With the same cDNA library, we cloned a 679-bp fragment using PCR primers P3 (5′-CTACTGCCTGTTCTGCTTCG) and P4 (5′-TGTGTCTCCTCGGGATGTG) that spanned the central region of the proposed ORF and overlapped with the 3′-fragment. Combining the 679-bp and 456-bp fragments together with PCR primers P3 and P6, we obtained a 938-bp fragment that spanned two-thirds of the proposed ORF. Finally, we cloned a 452-bp fragment from the 5′-region of the proposed ORF using PCR primers P1 (5′-CGTTATCATGTCGCTGAG GCAG) and P2 (5′-CAGAAGGGGAAGAACAGGATGTAG) that overlapped with the 938-bp fragment. The full-length 1322 bp cDNA clone was obtained by combining the overlapping 452-bp and 938-bp fragments together with PCR primers P1 and P6, then was subsequently cloned into pCRII TA-Cloning Vector (Invitrogen). Digestion of the clone with KpnI and EcoRI allowed for subcloning the hSPPase ORF into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Digestion of pcDNA3-hSPPase1 with HindIII and EcoRI was necessary to subclone hSPPase into pEGFP-C3 (Clontech). Additionally, the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region were cloned using PCR primers (5′-CTCCGCTTTCTCATCCTCCC and 5′-TCACCATTCCTTTAGCCTGC) in accordance with the manufacturer's suggested protocol (Clontech) using the human fetal kidney Marathon-ready cDNA. Immunostaining—MCF-7 cells grown on 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized and blocked with 0.1% saponin/1% bovine serum albumin-phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min prior to incubation with 20 μg/ml of rabbit anti-calreticulin (Sigma) for 1 h, and 10 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit conjugated with rhodamine (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 h, both diluted in 0.1% saponin/1% bovine serum albumin-phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were viewed under an Olympus IX 70 confocal microscope with a Plan Apo 60× oil objective (numerical aperature 1.4), and images were captured using PerkinElmer Life Sciences ultraview software that was set for 488 nm excitation and 516–560 nm emission for GFP fluorescent signal. Northern Blot Analysis—Poly(A)+ RNA blots containing 1 μg RNA from 12 different human tissues (Clontech) were probed with a 1.3-kb KpnI/EcoRI fragment from pcDNA3-hSPPase1 generated by [32P]dCTP random priming. Blots were hybridized for 2 h in ExpressHyb buffer at 68 °C and washed according to manufacturer's protocol. Sphingolipid Measurements—Sphingolipid measurements were performed using electrospray ionization ms/ms analysis on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadruple mass spectrometer, operating in multiple reaction monitoring positive ionization mode as previously described (19Pettus, B. J., Bielawski, J., Porcelli, A. M., Reames, D. L., Johnson, K. R., Morrow, Chalfant, C. E., Obeid, L. M., and Hannun, Y. A. (2003) FASEB J., in pressGoogle Scholar). In Vitro Phosphatase Activity Assay—Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were scraped in 250 μl buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm semicarbazide, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science)) and lysed by sonication. Following centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant containing disrupted cells were subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Supernatant containing the cytosolic fraction was transferred to a separate tube, whereas the pellet containing the membranous fraction was resuspended in 250 μl buffer A. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Phosphatase activity was measured by incubating 4 μg of cytosol or membrane fractions in buffer A with 10 μm [4,5-3H]dihydro-S1P or [3H]S1P (30,000 cpm; American Radiolabeled Chemical, Inc.) complexed with 0.3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. After 30 min at 37 °C, the lipids were extracted with 3 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1) followed by the addition of 0.7 volumes of water. The organic phase was dried under a nitrogen stream and resuspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1). Lipids were resolved by TLC on silica gel G60 with chloroform/methanol/4.2 N ammonium hydroxide (9:7:2). To assay for phosphatase activity of immunoprecipitated hSPPase tagged at the carboxyl terminus with c-Myc, pcDNA4-hSPPase-c-Myc, or vector alone were overexpressed in HEK293 cells for 48 h. Membrane fractions were collected as described above, except for the addition of 0.1% Tween 20 to buffer A for resuspention of membrane pellet. Following preclearing of the membrane fractions (500 μg) with protein A/G agarose (Santa Cruz), protein was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of mouse anti-c-myc antibody (Santa Cruz) for2hat4 °C. Then, 30 μl of protein A/G agarose was added for 1 h. The beads were washed four times with buffer A and resuspended 60 μl for assaying phosphatase activity. Aliquots of the membrane fractions (25 μg) were resolved on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with mouse anti-c-myc antibody and visualized using goat anti-mouse conjugated to horseradish peroxidase along with the ECL immunoblotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Knockdown of hSPPase1 Expression Using Small Interfering RNA— hSPPase mRNA knockdown was performed using sequence-specific siRNA reagents (www.mpibpc.gwdg.de/abteilungen/100/105/sirna.html). Twenty-one nucleotide siRNA for hSPPase (GAAAGUGGCCCGUUUCCAGdTT and CUGGAAACGGGCCACUUUCdTT)(Xeragon) were targeted, 54 nucleotides downstream of the start codon. Transfection of siRNA duplex was performed using OligofectAMINE reagent as described by the manufacturer with slight modifications (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected and allowed to continue to grow in media containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Reverse Transcription PCR—mRNA was isolated from both HEK293 and MCF-7 cells using the RNeasy mini kit from Qiagen. cDNA was generated using SuperScript II Rnase H–reverse transcriptase from Invitrogen. Reverse transcription reactions were optimized on Stratagene Gradient 96 Robocycler using Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) to determine optimal conditions for the linear range of cDNA amplification. Linear amplification of a 679-bp fragment of hSPPase1 using PCR primers (5′-CTACTGCCTGTTCTGCTTCG and 5′-TGTGTCTCCTCGGGATGTG) was achieved at 30 cycles of replication (94 °C, 1 min; 58 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 2 min) and normalized to 28 S ribosomal RNA. MTT Assay—Thirty-six hours after transfection with siRNA, cells were treated with 5 μm daunorubicin, 5 nm TNF-α, or vehicle for 18 h. The relative number of viable cells was determined using the MTT based in vitro toxicology assay kit as described by the manufacturer (Sigma). In Vivo Labeling of Cells with Sphingosine—HEK293 cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/60 mm dish 24 h prior to the addition of 200 nm siRNA for 48 h. Ten minutes before the end of the time point, cells were pulsed with 300 nm [3H]d-erythro-sphingosine (2.5 μCi). Lipids were extracted by the addition of 2.5 volumes of chloroform/butanol/HCl (50:50:1), and the organic layer was dried under nitrogen. Lipids were separated using thin layer chromatography in chloroform/methanol/15 mm calcium chloride (60:35:8). Bands corresponding to S1P standards were scraped and the radioactivity measured using a scintillation counter. Cloning of Human SPPase—To identify the human isoform for SPPase, we performed a tBLASTn search in the GenBank™ EST data bank using the mouse SPPase amino acid sequence and found several clones with homology: AA331563, AW962915, AW963799, and AW955216. A similar tBLASTn search scanning the human genomic sequence data bank revealed several regions of chromosome 14q23.1 (AL161670), with high homology to the mouse SPPase. Using PCR-based cloning strategies, the entire ORF of human SPPase1 was cloned from a human fetal kidney cDNA library (AF349315). The hSPPase1 ORF encoded a protein with 441 amino acids (approximate molecular mass = 48.9 kD) possessing 78% identity with an additional 6% similarity or 19% identity with an additional 17% similarity to the mSPPase and YSR2, respectively (Fig. 1A). Examination of the sequence revealed the hSPPase1 contained all three conserved motifs: 1) KXXXXXXRP, 2) SXH, and 3) SRXXXXXHXXXD found in the superfamily of type 2 lipid phosphate phosphatases. Of note, hSPPase 1 and 2 contain a consensus PSTH sequence in the second conserved motif which differs slightly from XSGH sequence found in the other members of type 2 lipid phosphate phosphatase family. Plotting the hydrophilicity using the Kyte-Doolitle algorithm predicted hSPPase1 to contain 6–8 possible transmembrane domains with the three conserved lipid phosphatase domains oriented on the same surface (Fig. 1B). Subcellular Localization of hSPPase1—To determine the subcellular localization of hSPPase1, the amino terminus was tagged with GFP. Transient expression of hSPPase1-GFP in both MCF-7 and HEK293 cells revealed a membranous reticular pattern consistent with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Immunostaining these cells, transiently expressing hSPPase1-GFP, with the well known ER marker calreticulin demonstrated clear colocalization represented by the superimposable images (Fig. 2). Overlay with markers to other endomembrane compartments such as lysosomes, mitochondria, and golgi demonstrated no significant colocalization (data not shown). Similar ER localization was found in cells transiently expressing carboxyl terminus c-Myc-tagged hSPPase1 as far out as 96 h post-transfection (data not shown). Thus, the subcellular localization of hSPPase1 is consistent with the subcellular localization of its yeast (YSR2 and YSR3) and mouse (mSPPase 1) homologues (13Le Stunff H. Peterson C. Thorton R. Milstien S. Mandala S.M. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8920-8927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Mao C. Saba J.D. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Tissue-specific Expression of hSPPase1 mRNA—To examine tissue-specific expression of hSPPase1 mRNA, we utilized Northern bot analysis. A single 3.3-kb transcript was detected in all tissues. The expression levels varied among tissues, with the highest expression found in kidney and placenta, and the lowest expression found in peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig. 3). These results parallel recently reported results by Ogawa et al. (14Ogawa C. Kihara A. Gokoh M. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1268-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Deposphorylation of S1P and Dihydro-S1P by hSPPase1—To determine whether the ER-localized hSPPase1 possesses enzymatic activity, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3-hSPPase 1 or vector alone for 48 h. Cytosolic fractions from either transfectant had modest SPPase activity. In contrast, the membrane fraction of hSPPase overexpressors exhibited an ∼2-fold increase in phosphatase activity over vector control membrane fractions (Fig. 4A). A similar profile of phosphatase activities was seen when dihydro-S1P was substituted as a substrate (Fig. 4B). To confirm that the expressed protein itself accounted for the increased activity, in vitro phosphatase activity assays were conducted on immunoprecipitates of c-Myc-tagged hSPPase1. The results demonstrated significant SPPase activity in immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4C), and therefore they establish that the increase in phosphatase activity observed above was a direct result of hSPPase1 and not due to activation of a regulatory protein or by a nonspecific phosphatase. Immunoblot analysis of the membrane fractions confirmed c-Myc-tagged hSPPase1 is indeed expressed in its intact full-length form (Fig. 4C, inset). siRNA Knockdown of hSPPase1 Results in S1P Accumulation—Thus far, studies have concentrated on the effects of overexpression of SPPases. To establish whether endogenous hSPPase1 is a key enzyme regulating S1P levels within the cell, RNAi technology was utilized to “knockdown” endogenous hSPPase1. Within 24–48 h of gene-specific siRNA treatment, reverse transcription PCR detection showed significantly reduced levels of hSPPase1 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, mock or scrambled siRNA treatment resulted in no change of hSPPase1 levels as compared with untreated control (Fig. 5A). Reverse transcription PCR of 28 S ribosomal RNA controlled for differences in loading in all samples and for the presence of housekeeping gene mRNA in the hSPPase 1 siRNA treated samples. In vitro phosphatase activity on the membrane fraction of hSPPase1 siRNA-treated cells demonstrated a 25% overall reduction in S1P phosphatase activity as compared with the scrambled control (Fig. 5B). These data confirmed siRNA treatments resulted in significant reduction in hSPPase1 levels. Examination of MCF-7 cells for mRNA expression levels of both hSPPase1 and hSPPase2 revealed an approximate 6-fold higher level of hSPPase1 mRNA expression as compared with hSPPase2 (data not shown). Pulsing cells with [3H]sphingosine resulted in a nearly 2-fold increase in S1P accumulation within hSPPase1 knockdown cells as compared with mock or scrambled (Fig. 6, A and B). Interestingly, a similar fold increase was also seen in the secretion of S1P into the extracellular medium of hSPPase1 knockdown cells as compared with mock or scrambled. These data suggest that hSPPase1 not only is a key enzyme responsible for the regulation of intracellular levels of S1P, but also is involved in the regulation of extracellular S1P levels. siRNA Knockdown of hSPPase1 Increases Resistance to Cytotoxic Agents—S1P is known to exert cytoprotective effects within cells; therefore, we implemented siRNA knockdown of endogenous hSPPase1 to explore the biological significance of the subsequent S1P accumulation in cells exposed to cytotoxic agents. Cells transfected with scrambled siRNA and treated with 5 μm daunorubicin or 5 nm TNF-α for 18 h resulted in a drastic reduction in viable cells to 40 and 33%, respectively (Fig. 7). Significantly, knockdown of hSPPase1 conferred a nearly 2-fold increase in cell viability, resulting in 70 and 56% cell survival, respectively (Fig. 7). Collectively, these data indicate that by regulating S1P levels, hSPPase1 mediates cellular response to challenges by cytotoxic agents. In this manuscript we describe the cloning of the human SPPase1, which contains multiple transmembrane domains, localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, and possesses the three conserved catalytic domains present in the superfamily of type 2 lipid phosphate phosphatases. Tissue-specific expression patterns revealed hSPPase1 levels to be greatest in highly vascularized tissues of the kidney and placenta. hSPPase1 possessed enzymatic activity against both S1P and dihydro-S1P, and has previously been shown to dephosphorylate phyto-S1P (13Le Stunff H. Peterson C. Thorton R. Milstien S. Mandala S.M. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8920-8927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Enforced knockdown of endogenous hSPPase1 expression led to not only the accumulation of intracellular S1P, but also the extracellular release of S1P. Furthermore, the reduced expression of hSPPase 1 conferred significant resistance to cytotoxic challenge by daunorubicin or TNF-α. S1P-mediated signaling is involved in regulating numerous biological processes; therefore, it is not surprising that S1P levels within the cell are tightly regulated. A wide variety of stimuli have been shown to increase sphingosine kinase activity and generate S1P (20Maceyka M. Payne S.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). S1P-mediated signaling occurs through the binding to cell surface receptors S1P1–5 and activating G-protein-coupled receptors pathways (21Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25851-25854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In addition, S1P signals intracellularly through a proposed G-protein-coupled receptor-independent pathway (21Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25851-25854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). One line of evidence presented by Waggoner et al. (22Waggoner D.W. Xu J. Singh I. Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Brindley D.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 299-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) suggests that lipid phosphate phosphatases localizing to the plasma membrane may regulate S1P-mediated signaling of cell surface receptors through ectophosphatase activity. The most recent evidence for a sphingoid base phosphate-specific phosphatase regulating S1P signaling comes from recent studies by Le Stunff et al. (17Le Stunff H. Galve-Roperh I. Peterson C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) in which mSPPase1 was overexpressed and cells were given exogenous S1P. These studies found mSPPase1 dephosphorylation of S1P could result in synthesis of ceramide and ultimately lead to programmed cell death. Although these previous studies have utilized overexpression of lipid phosphate phosphatases or mSPPase1 to examine the regulation of S1P-mediated signaling, our studies describe for the first time a role for endogenous hSPPase1 in the regulation of intracellular and extracellular S1P levels. How S1P levels are regulated in cells remains poorly understood. S1P may be metabolized by S1P lyase into phosphoethanolamine and hexadecenal; however, little is known about the role S1P lyase plays in the regulation of S1P signaling (23Van Veldhoven P.P. Gijsbers S. Mannaerts G.P. Vermeesch J.R. Brys V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). S1P is also regulated by SPPases. Using siRNA knockdown of hSPPase1, we show significant accumulation of S1P intracellularly and increased secretion of S1P into the extracellular milieu. These studies indicate hSPPase1 is important for governing S1P levels, thereby ultimately regulating S1P signaling. One possibility is that S1P generated in the cytosol is somehow accessible to membrane-associated components. Cytosolic S1P could be transported and metabolized by hSPPase1 in the ER or released extracellularly. Upon siRNA knockdown of hSPPase1, S1P may be preferentially secreted (Fig. 8). The above findings are particularly interesting in light of our recent report showing activation of sphingosine kinase by the potent mitogen, phorbol myristate acetate, led to increased secretion of S1P (18Johnson K.R. Becker K.P. Facchinetti M.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35257-35262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that hSPPase1 may act to mute mitogen-induced S1P secretion. Because S1P is known to be involved in various mitogenic pathways, the elucidation of its enzymatic regulation is of paramount importance in dissecting the pathophysiological processes of inflammation, angiogenesis, and oncogenesis. Regulation of sphingolipid metabolites is crucial to cell survival. Tipping the balance toward S1P generation by sphingosine kinase activation precludes induction of apoptosis (24Kleuser B. Cuvillier O. Spiegel S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1817-1824PubMed Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of SPPase leads to the breakdown of S1P into sphingosine and ceramide, thereby promoting induction of apoptosis (17Le Stunff H. Galve-Roperh I. Peterson C. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Our studies show that regulation of endogenous levels of hSPPase1 by siRNA leads to increased levels of S1P and results in a marked resistance to apoptosis. As shown in Table I, S1P levels indeed doubled in response to siRNA knockdown of hSPPase1 concomitant with a significant decrease in sphingosine, thus possibly shifting the cellular balance from pro-apoptotic to pro-survival. In fact previous studies by Nava et al. (25Nava V.E. Hobson J.P. Murthy S. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 281: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) found increases of S1P levels in MCF-7 cells overexpressing sphingosine kinase conferred resistance to cell death induced by the cytotoxic agents doxorubicin and TNF-α (25Nava V.E. Hobson J.P. Murthy S. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 281: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Therefore, hSPPase1 may be a key component in deciding whether a cell survives or enters apoptosis. Intuitively, one can envision a tumor suppressor role for hSPPase1 whereby in neoplasia hSPPase1 down-regulation would lead to uninhibited cell growth and angiogenesis. In fact, the Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer 2Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer (2003) (Mitelman, F., Johansson, B., and Mertens, F., eds.), cgap.nci.nih. gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman. reveals several deletions in the region of chromosome 14q23 to which hSPPase1 maps, corresponding to diffuse B-cell lymphoma, mesothelioma, and multiple myeloma. Assuming oncogenic processes depend upon a reduction in SPPase activity, manipulation of this activity may have therapeutic implications.Table ISphingolipid measurements in siRNA treated MCF-7 cellsS1PSPHpmol/mg total proteinSCR1.2 ± 0.191.5 ± 10.6hSPPase12.4 ± 0.477.4 ± 3.6 Open table in a new tab In conclusion, these findings suggest intracellular regulation of hSPPase1 is necessary for the cell to modulate levels of S1P to control signaling events in an autocrine/paracrine fashion leading to biological processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Future studies dissecting regulatory domains and signaling events of hSPPase1 will enable us to characterize further the roles this enzyme plays in cell homeostasis. We thank Dr. Yusuf A.

A potential role for AEA in skin pathophysiology has been proposed, yet its molecular basis remains unknown. Here we report unprecedented evidence that spontaneously immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT) and normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) have the biochemical machinery to bind and metabolize AEA, i.e. a functional type-1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R), a selective AEA membrane transporter (AMT), an AEA-degrading fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and an AEA-synthesizing phospholipase D (PLD). We show that, unlike CB1R and PLD, the activity of AMT and the activity and expression of FAAH increase while the endogenous levels of AEA decrease in HaCaT and NHEK cells induced to differentiate in vitro by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) plus calcium. We also show that exogenous AEA inhibits the formation of cornified envelopes, a hallmark of keratinocyte differentiation, in HaCaT and NHEK cells treated with TPA plus calcium, through a CB1R-dependent reduction of transglutaminase and protein kinase C activity. Moreover, transient expression in HaCaT cells of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene under control of the loricrin promoter, which contained a wild-type or mutated activating protein-1 (AP-1) site, showed that AEA inhibited AP-1 in a CB1R-dependent manner. Taken together, these data demonstrate that human keratinocytes partake in the peripheral endocannabinoid system and show a novel signaling mechanism of CB1 receptors, which may have important implications in epidermal differentiation and skin development.

Endocannabinoids are amides, esters, and ethers of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, found in several human tissues (1Maccarrone M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Vitam.

Kobayashi Y. Oka S. Waku K. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 173-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). They bind to both brain (CB1) and peripheral (CB2) cannabinoid receptors, thus mimicking some of the central and peripheral effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive principle of hashish and marijuana (3Mechoulam R. Panikashvili D. Shohami E. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 58-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Recently, AEA has also been shown to activate vanilloid receptors (4De Petrocellis L. Bisogno T. Maccarrone M. Davis J.B. Finazzi-Agrò A. Di Marzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12856-12863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 5Jordt S.E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The effect of AEA via CB1R and CB2R depends on its extracellular concentration, which is controlled by (i) cellular uptake by a specific AEA membrane transporter (AMT) and (ii) intracellular degradation by the AEA-hydrolyzing enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). AMT (6Hillard C.J. Jarrahian A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and FAAH (7Ueda N. Puffenbarger R.A. Yamamoto S. Deutsch D.G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) have been characterized in several mammalian cells and tissues. Moreover, the main player in AEA synthesis is thought to be a N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs)-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (PLD) (8Hansen H.S. Moesgaard B. Hansen H.H. Petersen G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In addition, the pathways for the biosynthesis and degradation of 2-AG are different from those of AEA (2Sugiura T. Kobayashi Y. Oka S. Waku K. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 173-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and include a recently identified monoglyceride lipase as the primary mechanism for 2-AG inactivation (9Dinh T.P. Carpenter D. Leslie F.M. Freund T.F. Katona I. Sensi S.L. Kathuria S. Piomelli D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10819-10824Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Together with AEA and congeners, all these proteins form the “endocannabinoid system.” Endocannabinoids play a number of roles in the central nervous system (10Fride E. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 221-233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and in peripheral tissues (1Maccarrone M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Vitam. Horm. 2002; 65: 225-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, peripheral AEA acts as a cardiovascular and immune systems modulator, shows anti-inflammatory activity, and inhibits human cancer cell proliferation, being more generally involved in the control of cell survival and death (11Guzman M. Sanchez C. Galve-Roperh I. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 95: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). AEA has also been shown to attenuate the pain sensation produced by chemical damage to cutaneous tissue, by interacting with CB1-like cannabinoid receptors located outside the central nervous system (12Calignano A. La Rana G. Giuffrida A. Piomelli D. Nature. 1998; 394: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, growing evidence has been accumulated suggesting a role for the endocannabinoid system in the peripheral control of pain initiation (13Calignano A. La Rana G. Loubet-Lescoulie P. Piomelli D. Prog. Brain Res. 2000; 129: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Walker J.M. Huang S.M. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 235-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), leading also to the hypothesis that CBRs possibly present in epidermal cells might act as cutaneous nociceptors (15Nakamura A. Shiomi H. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 79: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As a matter of fact, mouse epidermal cells contain endogenous AEA, which mediates cellular response to ultraviolet B irradiation (16Berdyshev E.V. Schmid P.C. Dong Z. Schmid H.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and a stable analogue of AEA has been shown to inhibit the proliferation in vitro of rat epithelial cells, through a CB1-dependent mechanism (17Bifulco M. Laezza C. Portella G. Vitale M. Orlando P. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2745-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent report has shown that skin tumors of mice and men express CB1R and CB2R, that healthy human skin expresses CB1R, and that synthetic agonists of CBRs inhibit tumor growth (18Casanova M.L. Blazquez C. Martinez-Palacio J. Villanueva C. Fernandez-Acenero M.J. Huffman J.W. Torcano J.L. Guzman M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Moreover, isolated rat paw skin responds to an in vitro model of neuropathic pain according to a CB1-dependent mechanism (19Ellington H.C. Cotter M.A. Cameron N.E. Ross R.A. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 42: 966-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This background prompted us to investigate whether human keratinocytes have the biochemical machinery to bind and metabolize AEA and how the endocannabinoid system might be implicated in the control of epidermal cell growth and differentiation. Materials—Chemicals were of the purest analytical grade. Anandamide (AEA), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), minimum essential medium, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), N,N′-dimethylcasein, and putrescine were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

[3H]AEA (223 Ci/mmol) and [3H]CP55.940 (5-(1,1′-dimethyheptyl)-2-[1R,5R-hydroxy-2R-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexyl]-phenol; 126 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Köln, Germany). 1,2-Dioleoyl-3-phosphatidyl[2-14C]ethanolamine (55 mCi/mmol), [3H]putrescine (22 Ci/mmol), and adenosine 5′-[γ-32P]triphosphate (5000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). [3H]Resinferatoxin (48 Ci/mmol) was a kind gift of Dr. Vincenzo Di Marzo (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Pozzuoli, Italy). Anti-FAAH polyclonal antibodies were elicited in rabbits against the conserved FAAH sequence VGYYETDNYTMPSPAMR (20Giang D.K. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rabbit anti-CB1R and anti-CB2R polyclonal antibodies were from Cayman Chemicals, and mouse anti-actin monoclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (GAR-AP and GAM-AP) were from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Cell Culture and Treatment—HaCaT cells (21Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 106: 761-771Crossref Scopus (3464) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Prof. N. E. Fusenig (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany) and were grown in a 1:1 mixture of minimum essential medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% nonessential amino acids, at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere (22Savini I. Catani M.V. Rossi A. Duranti G. Melino G. Avigliano L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 372-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cryopreserved normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) from newborn foreskin were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and were grown in dishes coated with calf skin collagen type III (100 mg/ml) in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (Invitrogen), as reported (23Candi E.

Third passage NHEK cells were used for each experiment. Cell differentiation was induced by treating both HaCaT and NHEK cells with TPA (10 ng/ml) plus CaCl2 (1.2 mm) for 6 h, 24 h, or 5 days (22Savini I. Catani M.V. Rossi A. Duranti G. Melino G.

Melino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35014-35023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). AEA and related compounds were added directly to the culture medium at the same time as TPA plus calcium. Controls were treated with vehicle alone. After each treatment, cell viability was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test and by Trypan Blue dye exclusion, as reported (24Maccarrone M. Lorenzon T. Bari M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31938-31945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Binding to Cannabinoid Receptors—For cannabinoid receptor studies, membrane fractions were prepared from HaCaT cells (25 × 106/test) as reported (24Maccarrone M. Lorenzon T. Bari M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31938-31945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and were used in rapid filtration assays with the synthetic cannabinoid [3H]CP55.940 (24Maccarrone M. Lorenzon T. Bari M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31938-31945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Apparent dissociation constant (Kd) and maximum binding (B max) values of [3H]CP55.940 were calculated from saturation curves through nonlinear regression analysis with the Prism 3 program (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) (24Maccarrone M. Lorenzon T. Bari M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31938-31945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). CBR binding was assayed also in NHEK cells (25 × 106/test), using 200 pm [3H]CP55.940. Binding of [3H]AEA to HaCaT cells was evaluated with the same filtration assays used for [3H]CP55.940 (24Maccarrone M. Lorenzon T. Bari M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31938-31945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and apparent Kd and B max values were calculated through nonlinear regression analysis of saturation curves. Also binding of [3H]resinferatoxin to HaCaT cells was evaluated by rapid filtration assays, performed as described previously (25Ross R.A. Gibson T.M. Brockie H.C. Lesile M. Pashmi G. Craib S.J. Di Marzo V. Pertwee R.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In all experiments, unspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm “unlabeled” agonist (24Maccarrone M. Lorenzon T. Bari M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31938-31945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 25Ross R.A. Gibson T.M. Brockie H.C. Lesile M. Pashmi G. Craib S.J. Di Marzo V. Pertwee R.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The expression of CB1R and CB2R in HaCaT cells was assessed by Western blot analysis, performed as detailed below for FAAH, using anti-CB1 or anti-CB2 polyclonal antibodies (each diluted 1:250), and GAR-AP (diluted 1:2000) as second antibody (26Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanici C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Saturation curves of [3H]CP55.940 binding and Western blot analysis of CB1R and CB2R were performed under the same experimental conditions on mouse brain and mouse spleen extracts. Analysis of Anandamide Uptake—The uptake of [3H]AEA by the AEA membrane transporter (AMT) of intact HaCaT cells (2 × 106/test) was performed as described previously (27Maccarrone M. Bari M. Lorenzon T. Bisogno T. Di Marzo V. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13484-13492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To discriminate noncarrier-mediated from carrier-mediated transport of AEA through cell membranes, [3H]AEA uptake at 4 °C was subtracted from that at 37 °C (28Hillard C.J. Edgemond W.S. Jarrahian A. Campbell W.B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The Q10 value of AMT was calculated as the ratio of AEA uptake at 30 °C and 20 °C (28Hillard C.J. Edgemond W.S. Jarrahian A. Campbell W.B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Incubations (15 min) were also carried out with different concentrations of [3H]AEA, in the range 0–800 nm, to determine the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), maximum velocity (V max), and inhibition constant (Ki) of AMT by nonlinear regression analysis (also in this case, the uptake at 4 °C was subtracted from that at 37 °C). The effect of different compounds on the uptake (15 min) of 200 nm [3H]AEA by AMT was determined by adding each substance directly to the incubation medium, at the indicated concentrations. AMT activity was assayed also in NHEK cells (2 × 106/test), using 400 nm [3H]AEA as substrate. Cell viability after each treatment was higher than 90% in all cases. FAAH Activity and Expression—Fatty acid amide hydrolase (EC 3.5.1.4; FAAH) activity and its apparent Km, V max, and Ki values were determined in HaCaT cells (20 μg/test) as reported (26Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanici C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). FAAH activity was also assayed in NHEK cells (20 μg/test), using 5 μm [3H]AEA as substrate. HaCaT cell homogenates (20 μg/lane) were prepared as described (26Maccarrone M. Valensise H. Bari M. Lazzarin N. Romanici C. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7183-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12%) under reducing conditions. Rainbow molecular mass markers (Amersham Biosciences) were phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.0 kDa), ovalbumin (46.0 kDa), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (27.0 kDa). For immunochemical analysis, gels were electroblotted onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad) and were immunoreacted with anti-FAAH polyclonal (1:200) or anti-actin monoclonal (1:1000) antibodies, using GAR-AP or GAM-AP (diluted 1:2000) as second antibody, respectively (26Maccarrone M.

Densitometric analysis of filters was performed by means of a Floor-S™ Multi-Imager, equipped with Quantity One software (BioRad).

These saturation curves were very close to those obtained with mouse brain membranes (Fig. 1A), a positive control for CB1R (35Pertwee R.G. Pharmacol.

Specifically, hSpry2 inhibits the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway but conversely prolongs activity of the same pathway following epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, where activated EGF receptors are retained on the cell surface. In this study it is demonstrated that hSpry2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation by either FGFR or EGF and subsequently binds endogenous c-Cbl with high affinity. A conserved motif on hSpry2, together with phosphorylation on tyrosine 55, is required for its enhanced interaction with the SH2-like domain of c-Cbl. A hSpry2 mutant (Y55F) that did not exhibit an enhanced binding with c-Cbl failed to retain EGF receptors on the cell surface. Furthermore, individually mutating hSpry2 residues 52–59 to alanine indicated a tight correlation between their affinity for c-Cbl binding and their inhibition of ERK2 activity in the FGFR pathway. We postulate that tyrosine phosphorylation “activates” hSpry2 by enhancing its interaction with c-Cbl and that this interaction is critical for its physiological function in a signal-specific context.

Different genetic studies have indicated that dSpry inhibits the Ras/MAPK pathway at various points including downstream of Ras activation around the level of Raf (6Reich A. Sapir A. Shilo B. Development. 1999; 126: 4139-4147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which coincides with studies on the point of inhibition of human Spry2 (3Yusoff P. Lao D.H. Ong S.H. Wong E.S. Lim J. Lo T.L.

Mammalian Spry2 was recently shown to prolong EGF-stimulated MAPK signaling by attenuating EGFR ubiquitination and endocytosis (7Wong E.S. Fong C.W. Lim J. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Langdon W.Y. Guy G.R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which is an E3-ubiquitin ligase, hSpry2 appears to compete off the docking of c-Cbl onto the tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR. Consequently, signals emanating from the EGFR are not attenuated but rather sustained. This study illustrated the dual function of Spry proteins in modulating the intensity and duration of MAPK signaling initiated by different RTKs. Two interesting observations were made during the course of our previous study: (a) upon stimulation of RTKs, the association between c-Cbl and hSpry2 was significantly increased and (b) hSpry2 was highly tyrosine-phosphorylated. The question was asked whether Spry2 and c-Cbl exhibit another level of interaction following activation of RTKs, whether this centered around tyrosine phosphorylation of Spry2, and how this may impact on the modulatory effect of Spry2 on the Ras/MAPK pathway. Antibodies, Reagents, and DNA Constructs—Monoclonal antibodies and agarose-conjugated beads against HA and FLAG epitope tags were obtained from Roche Applied Science and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. Monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (p44/p42) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20), monoclonal antibodies against ERK2 and c-Cbl were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-FGFR1 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Human c-Cbl cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. W. Langdon (University of Western Australia). The full-length c-Cbl cDNA and the various deletion mutants were constructed and subcloned into pXJ40HA vector as previously described (9Wong E.S. Lim J. Low B.C. Chen Q. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). hSpry2 mutants were constructed using the site-directed mutagenesis kit from Clontech according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutant products were derived using wild type FLAG-hSpry2 as template and verified by DNA sequencing. Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting, Cell Culture, and Confocal Microscopy—Immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and cell culture were performed as described previously (3Yusoff P. Lao D.H. Ong S.H. Wong E.S. Lim J. Lo T.L. Leong H.F. Fong C.W. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 3195-3201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). M2 (anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose) beads were used for immunoprecipitating FLAG-tagged proteins, whereas anti-HA-conjugated agarose beads were used for HA-tagged proteins. Confocal microscopy was carried out by seeding COS-7 cells onto 60-mm diameter tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. At 70% confluency, the cells were transfected with 1–2 μg of FLAG-tagged plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. On the following day, the cells were trypsinized and plated into 6-well plates containing sterilized glass coverslips at a confluency of 30%. The cells were treated with or without EGF (50 ng/ml) for 30 min before fixing in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBSCM (phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm MgCl2) buffer for 30 min at room temperature, then permeabilized with 0.1% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBSCM for 15 min at room temperature. Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 1 μg/100 μl in fluorescence dilution buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in PBSCM). After washing three times with PBSCM buffer, Texas Red dye-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Groove, PA) was added to the cells at 1 μg/100 μl. The coverslips were mounted using Gel-Mount and viewed with an MRC-1024 (Bio-Rad) laser scanning confocal microscope. Far Western Assay—FLAG-tagged hSpry constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells using FuGENE 6 reagent. 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed, and the FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with M2 beads, followed by SDS-PAGE and transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was then blocked with 3% milk in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated with 1 μg/ml GST-c-Cbl protein diluted in 3% milk in PBST and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h. Excess GST-c-Cbl protein was washed off thoroughly with PBST and probed with anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Receptor Down-regulation Assay—EGF receptor down-regulation assay was performed essentially as previously described (7Wong E.S. Fong C.W. Lim J. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Langdon W.Y. Guy G.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4796-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) Spry2 Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated upon Stimulation Resulting in an Enhanced Interaction with Endogenous c-Cbl—Preliminary experiments indicated that hSpry2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation by various growth factors, particularly on the relatively nonconserved N-terminal half. Point mutations replacing all tyrosine residues with phenylalanine were constructed, and the following experiment was performed. The effect of EGF stimulation on these hSpry2 point mutations was studied by overexpressing FLAG-tagged hSpry2 in COS-7 cells (where relatively high levels of endogenous EGF receptors are present) followed by stimulation with EGF (50 ng/ml) for 10 min and immunoblotting the M2 (anti-FLAG) precipitated Spry2 protein with anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20 antibody). Our results indicate that compared with wild type hSpry2, mutating tyrosine 55 to phenylalanine (hSpry2Y55F) strongly reduces the phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 1A; all of the tyrosine residues were mutated, but only some of them are shown). Furthermore, the hSpry2Y55F mutant failed to interact with a 120-kDa phosphotyrosine protein that was previously identified as c-Cbl (9Wong E.S. Lim J. Low B.C. Chen Q. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The wild type hSpry2 and phenylalanine mutants did not show any basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation as indicated by the paucity of signals in the unstimulated lanes (Fig. 1A). The effects of FGFR activation on the hSpry2 tyrosine point mutations in HEK293T cells were next explored through the overexpression of FGFR1, which is constitutively active and hence mimics the sustained FGF signaling in developmental models. Similar to EGF stimulation, FGFR1 expression causes hSpry2 to be tyrosine-phosphorylated, as are the other point mutants with the exception of hSpry2Y55F (Fig. 1B). Endogenous c-Cbl was also demonstrated to be co-immunoprecipitated with hSpry2, as were the various tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants, again with the exception of hSpry2Y55F. Substituting phenylalanine for tyrosine results in a change of charge at the target site. To investigate whether the charge change, rather than phosphorylation, was likely to be responsible for the loss of binding to c-Cbl, we further mutated Tyr55 to various other amino acids: alanine (neutral), proline (neutral), histidine (positively charged), and glutamic acid (negatively charged). These hSpry2 mutants were tested for binding to c-Cbl, and they all failed to bind (result not shown), indicating that the tyrosine residue is indeed necessary for c-Cbl interaction. These mutants also failed to be tyrosine-phosphorylated when stimulated with EGF or when co-expressed with FGFR1. We next asked whether the tyrosine phosphorylation-induced interaction resulted in direct binding between c-Cbl and hSpry2. To this end we employed a far Western assay; a GST-c-Cbl fusion protein was generated and used to overlay a polyvinylidene difluoride blot of SDS-PAGE-resolved hSpry2 and hSpry2Y55F proteins overexpressed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1C). The membrane was washed thoroughly to remove unbound GST-c-Cbl protein and subsequently probed with GST antibody. An intense band corresponding to the size of hSpry2 was observed in the immunoprecipitate of hSpry2 and FGFR1 co-expressing cells (Fig. 1C, second lane), whereas a weaker signal was observed in the immunoprecipitate from unstimulated, hSpry2-expressing cells (Fig. 1C, first lane). This clearly indicates that c-Cbl protein binds directly to hSpry2, both constitutively and with a significantly higher affinity for the tyrosine-phosphorylated hSpry2. The mutant hSpry2Y55F (Fig. 1C, third lane) also shows weak constitutive interaction with GST-c-Cbl with a slightly lower level of binding in the presence of FGFR1 co-expression (Fig. 1C, fourth lane). The immunoprecipitate from vector-expressing cells did not bind GST-c-Cbl (Fig. 1C, fifth and sixth lanes), hence indicating that the binding of c-Cbl to hSpry2 and hSpry2Y55F is specific. We had previously characterized the constitutive binding of hSpry2 and c-Cbl (9Wong E.S. Lim J. Low B.C. Chen Q. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). During these studies we observed that there appeared to be an enhanced interaction between these two proteins following RTK activation. We were interested in ascertaining the relative strength of binding between c-Cbl and hSpry2 pre- and post-stimulation of RTKs and to investigate the likely physiological outcome of this apparent dual mode of interaction. We consistently found that the interaction between c-Cbl and tyrosine-phosphorylated hSpry2 was significantly stronger than their constitutive binding. Both could be observed if sufficient protein was used in binding experiments. For clarity we tended to use lower amounts of lysates to “isolate” the phosphotyrosine-dependent binding. Therefore, constitutive interactions between c-Cbl and hSpry2 may not be always observed unless the experimental conditions are optimal. Tyrosine 55 Embedded in a Conserved Motif on Spry2 Is Necessary for Enhanced c-Cbl Interaction—In view of the close homology of Spry2 residues 52–59 among all the Spry isoforms ((S/T)N(E/d)Y(T/V)(E/d)xP) (Fig. 2A), an alanine scan of these residues was performed to investigate their individual effect on c-Cbl binding. In the unstimulated state, these alanine mutants did not show any basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation, and c-Cbl was not detectable in the immunoprecipitates under the chosen experimental conditions (Fig. 2B). We then studied the ability of these mutants to interact with endogenous c-Cbl upon co-expression of FGFR1. Interestingly, singly mutating residues 53 and 59 to alanine also resulted in a loss of c-Cbl interaction, similar to the hSpry2Y55F mutant (Fig. 2C). Moreover, both 53A and 59A hSpry2 mutants were tyrosine-phosphorylated; notably, asparagine 53 and proline 59 (both with respect to hSpry2) are fully conserved among all Spry isoforms. The collective data indicate that hSpry2 phosphorylation, which evidence suggests occurs on tyrosine 55, can only enhance its binding with c-Cbl when the residues at the –2 (asparagine) and +4 (proline) positions relative to the tyrosine site (Tyr55) are both intact. The SH2-like Domain of c-Cbl Binds to Tyrosine-phosphorylated hSpry2—c-Cbl possesses a sequence, the atypical SH2 domain, that has been characterized to bind directly to a tyrosine-phosphorylated motif. We next performed an experiment to verify this interaction employing constructs of c-Cbl that were used previously to characterize the constitutive interaction with hSpry2 (9Wong E.S. Lim J. Low B.C. Chen Q. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows the c-Cbl constructs with either C- or N-terminal deletions that were employed for subsequent interaction studies. FGFR1 was co-expressed with the various c-Cbl deletion mutants in the absence or presence of FLAG-hSpry2 in HEK293T cells. M2 beads were used for immunoprecipitation, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The control experiment (Fig. 3B, left panel) indicates that the c-Cbl constructs do not interact nonspecifically with the M2 beads. In the presence of FLAG-hSpry2, c-Cbl constructs FL, NR, or NO were co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 3B, right panel) but not constructs lacking the SH2-like domain (NS or CR). Because FLAG-hSpry2 protein in the current experiment was stimulated by FGFR1 overexpression and hence tyrosine-phosphorylated, compelling evidence (comparing the binding capabilities of NO and NS) indicates that the SH2-like domain of c-Cbl is responsible for binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated hSpry2. As mentioned earlier there is a differential degree of binding between c-Cbl and hSpry2 in the unstimulated and stimulated conditions (Fig. 1C). The c-Cbl constructs containing the Ring finger motif were previously shown to bind GST-hSpry2 constitutively (9Wong E.S. Lim J. Low B.C. Chen Q. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To further illustrate the existence of this constitutive interaction in vivo, we repeated the experiment shown in Fig. 3B without FGFR1 co-expression. A set of c-Cbl constructs similar to those employed in Fig. 3A were used, with the addition of the c-Cbl construct CO (which does not have the Ring finger motif on the C-terminal; shown in Fig. 3C) as an appropriate control for CR. The result depicted in Fig. 3D demonstrates that c-Cbl constructs retaining the Ring finger motif (FL, NR, and CR) can be co-immunoprecipitated with hSpry2. A larger amount of cell lysate was employed in this experiment, which reinforces the notion that the constitutive interaction between c-Cbl and hSpry2 is relatively weak when compared with the phosphorylated tyrosine/SH2 interaction. Spry2Y55F Mutant Fails to Retain EGFR at the Cell Surface—We had previously shown that hSpry2, via an interaction with c-Cbl, inhibited the internalization of EGFRs, which subsequently led to a sustained activation of the MAPK pathway (7Wong E.S. Fong C.W. Lim J. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Langdon W.Y. Guy G.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4796-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). c-Cbl has been shown to bind phosphotyrosine 1045 on EGFR (10Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y.

Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), which is contained within a sequence that shares close homology to the conserved Spry motif shown in Fig. 2A. A possible mechanism for the hSpry2-mediated inhibition of EGFR endocytosis is that Tyr55-phosphorylated hSpry2 offers an alternative binding site for the SH2-like domain of c-Cbl, which would compete for the binding of c-Cbl to tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFRs and therefore subsequently inhibit receptor ubiquitination. In essence it would be the SH2/Tyr55 phosphorylation motif interaction that would mediate the observed EGFR-inhibited endocytosis rather than the constitutive and weaker interaction between hSpry2 and the c-Cbl Ring finger domain. In this modified hypothesis hSpry2Y55F should be unable to inhibit c-Cbl-mediated EGFR endocytosis. To this end we compared the effects of wild type hSpry2 and hSpry2Y55F on the rate of EGFR internalization. COS-7 cells were again employed in this experiment because of the high level of endogenous EGFR. As depicted in Fig. 4A, whereas c-Cbl-transfected COS-7 cells enhanced the rate of internalization of activated EGFR, cells doubly transfected with c-Cbl and hSpry2 showed an impeded endocytosis, consistent with the reported role of hSpry2 (7Wong E.S.

U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6041-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Conversely, c-Cbl/hSpry2Y55F transfectants failed to block receptor endocytosis, and the surface EGFR levels were observed to decrease at basal rates. The equal expression level of the various constructs is shown in Fig. 4B. A prominent role of c-Cbl in regulating RTK signaling is to function as an E3-ubiquitin ligase, acting on substrates such as the EGFR (10Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). We had previously shown that hSpry2 can interfere with c-Cbl ubiquitination of EGFR because of the competition for the Ring finger domain of c-Cbl with the E2-ubiquitin ligase, UbcH7 (7Wong E.S. Fong C.W. Lim J. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Langdon W.Y. Guy G.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4796-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Because our current data indicates that hSpry2Y55F protein does not exhibit an enhanced interaction with c-Cbl upon RTK stimulation, this construct is therefore useful to address whether the constitutive or tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent binding with c-Cbl is important to modulate EGFR ubiquitination. HA-ubiquitin together with c-Cbl, hSpry2, and hSpry2Y55F constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells, and the resultant SDS-PAGE-separated lysates were Western blotted and probed for the presence of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in EGFR immunoprecipitates, as previously described (7Wong E.S. Fong C.W. Lim J. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Langdon W.Y. Guy G.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4796-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Wild type hSpry2 was observed to significantly block the conjugation of ubiquitin onto EGFR, whereas the Y55F mutant exhibited a reduced albeit significant ubiquitination of EGFR (Fig. 4C). This indicates that tyrosine phosphorylation of hSpry2 is a necessary step in the reduction of the c-Cbl-directed ubiquitination of EGFR and the subsequent attenuation in the endocytosis of activated receptors. The partial inhibition of EGFR ubiquitination by the Y55F mutant may be due to the previously characterized weak constitutive interaction via the N-terminal region of Spry2 with the Ring finger domain of c-Cbl (9Wong E.S. Lim J. Low B.C. Chen Q. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The C termini of Spry proteins contain a cysteine-rich domain that is responsible for their translocation into membrane ruffles upon stimulation (11Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The failure of Spry2 to translocate into the cell periphery is known to result in a loss of Spry2 function, including inhibition of cell proliferation and migration (12Yigzaw Y. Cartin L. Pierre S. Scholich K. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22742-22747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is possible hSpry2Y55F, because of a resultant alteration in tertiary structure, was simply unable to translocate, which would explain its inability to function like its wild type counterpart. We ascertained, by employing confocal microscopy, the ability of hSpry2Y55F to translocate into membrane ruffles. In unstimulated COS-7 cells, we observed that both wild type hSpry2 (Fig. 4D, panel a) and hSpry2Y55F (Fig. 4D, panel c) exhibited strong staining that corresponded to a microtubule location, as described previously (11Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The addition of EGF (50 ng/ml) for 10 min induced the translocation of both hSpry2 (Fig. 4D, panel b) and hSpry2Y55F (Fig. 4D, panel d) to the cell periphery, notably membrane ruffles. It is therefore unlikely that hSpry2Y55F loses its ability to retain EGFR on the cell surface because of faulty targeting. We had previously established a paradigm for Spry isoforms that an intact Spry translocation domain (residues 178–282) was necessary for function (11Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because the point mutation of hSpry2Y55F does not impact on this function, it has become apparent that the phosphorylation of hSpry2 (probably on the Tyr55 residue) and the presence of the asparagine (position –2) and proline (position +4) that flank Tyr55 are necessary for hSpry2 interaction with c-Cbl in the context of inhibiting EGFR endocytosis. This further indicates that both the highly conserved cysteine-rich domain as well as the equally highly conserved three residues centered on Tyr55 (hSpry2) are essential for Spry functions. Tyrosine-phosphorylated hSpry2 Does Not Effect the Ubiquitination of FGFR or FRS2—Because hSpry2 appears to divert a ubiquitination process away from the EGFRs, we were interested to see whether there is any hSpry2/c-Cbl redistribution of ubiquitination in the FGFR system. Recently, c-Cbl was shown to partially attenuate FGFR signaling by both ubiquitination of FGFR and its necessary docker protein FRS2α (13Wong A. Lamothe B. Lee A. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6684-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Because these two molecules are key components of the FGFR signaling pathway, regulation of their activity or alteration of their cellular levels would be expected to have a profound effect on the magnitude of the FGFR-mediated signal. We therefore employed a similar protocol to that described for ubiquitination of EGFR (Fig. 4C), and the results of a typical experiment are shown in Fig. 5. The conjugation of ubiquitin molecules onto FGFR1 was clearly not affected by hSpry2 but was partially affected by the Y55F mutant. In the case of FRS2α, the basal level of ubiquitination was also not elevated with co-expression of FGFR1 (Fig. 5B). Overexpression of c-Cbl also did not result in enhanced ubiquitination, suggesting that the predominant E3-ubiuquitin ligase for FRS2α may not be c-Cbl. This could account for the inability of hSpry2, which binds avidly to c-Cbl upon FGFR1 co-expression, to alter FGFR1 and FRS2α ubiquitination levels as it does for EGFR. This possibility was also eluded to in a previous study (13Wong A. Lamothe B. Lee A. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6684-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Inhibition of FGFR-induced MAPK Inhibition by hSpry2 Depends on Its Stimulated Interaction with c-Cbl—Although Spry effects EGF pathways by binding c-Cbl, post-tyrosine phosphorylation, and effecting ubiquitination targets, it appears that the hSpry2/c-Cbl interaction in the context of the FGFR pathway may alternatively center around the ability of c-Cbl to act as a docking protein for other proteins and the likely redistribution of protein complexes following hSpry2 tyrosine phosphorylation. We therefore addressed whether tyrosine phosphorylation of hSpry2 per se or the binding of c-Cbl was essential to the ability of hSpry2 to inhibit the FGFR-stimulated Ras/MAPK pathway. To address this question we employed the various alanine mutants characterized in the early part of this study: hSpry2Y55A, which does not bind c-Cbl nor become tyrosine-phosphorylated, and hSpry2N53A and hSpry2P59A, both of which are tyrosine-phosphorylated but do not bind c-Cbl. The basal activation/repression of ERK by the alanine mutants was initially assessed by probing SDS-PAGE separated and Western blotted lysates with a phospho-ERK antibody that detects the phosphorylation of p44/p42(ERK1/2) on threonine 202 and tyrosine 204 residues (Fig. 6A). FGFR1 was then co-expressed into these cells to elevate ERK activity. Interestingly, hSpry2 mutants that failed to bind c-Cbl in a stimulation-dependent manner displayed a parallel loss of ERK inhibitory function (Fig. 6, B and C). It therefore appears that the inhibition of the FGFR-stimulated MAPK pathway by hSpry2 likely also involves stimulated binding to c-Cbl and not solely on tyrosine phosphorylation of hSpry2 protein. An additional ubiquitination experiment demonstrated that when the ubiquitin-incompetent c-Cbl(C381A) point mutant was transfected into 293T cells, hSpry2 was still able to attenuate the FGFR-induced MAPK pathway (results not shown). This indicates that the Spry-indu"

However, precise molecular information regarding cell-specific responses to beta-catenin signaling has been limited. This question was addressed using a mouse model in which exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene was deleted in several cell types with loxP-mediated recombination utilizing a Cre transgene under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat (MMTV-LTR). The stabilization of beta-catenin in prostate epithelium resulted in hyperplasias and extensive transdifferentiation into epidermal-like structures, which expressed keratins 1 and 6, filaggrin, loricrin and involucrin. The cell-specific loss of NKCC1 protein and reduced nuclear Stat5a is further suggestive of a loss of prostate epithelial characteristics. In addition to the prostate, hyperplasias and squamous metaplasias were detected in epithelia of the epididymis, vas deferens, coagulating gland, preputial gland and salivary gland. However, and in contrast to a recent study, no lesions reminiscent of high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia were detected. Since beta-catenin was activated in several cell types and impinged upon the viability of these mice, it was not possible to evaluate the cumulative effect over more than 3 months. To assess long-term consequences of beta-catenin activation, mutant and control prostate tissues were transplanted into the mammary fat pads of wild-type males. Notably, squamous metaplasias, intra-acinous hyperplasia and possible neoplastic transformation were observed after a total of 18 weeks of beta-catenin stimulation. This suggests that the transdifferentiation into squamous metaplasias is an early response of endoderm-derived cells to beta-catenin, and that the development of intra-acinous hyperplasias or neoplastic foci is a later event."

After subtraction of the artificial, random or cross-hybridization signals, data about 5315 genes have been effectively analysed in all samples. The assay revealed >/=4-fold difference in the average expression of 263 genes in all CML samples when compared to normal counterparts, with 148 genes being upregulated and 115 being downregulated. Differentially expressed genes include those associated with BCR/ABL-induced abnormalities in signal transduction, gene transactivation, cell cycle, apoptosis, adhesion, DNA repair, differentiation, metabolism and malignant progression. Interestingly, CML-blast crisis cells in peripheral blood differ from those from bone marrow, indicating major changes in gene expression profiles upon entering into the bloodstream. Moreover, BCR/ABL modulates expression of genes, which are involved in regulation of chromosome/chromatin/DNA dynamics during S and M cell cycle phase. Moreover, the ability of CML cells to recognize and respond to a pathogen infection may be compromised. Altogether, this work provides a large body of information regarding gene expression profiles associated with CML and also represents a source of potential targets for CML therapeutics."

Recent work has shown that the chloroquine resistance phenotype can be conferred by multiple amino acid mutations in the parasite digestive vacuole transmembrane protein PfCRT. Here, we have addressed whether chloroquine resistance can also be affected by changes in expression levels of this protein. Transient transfection reporter assays revealed that truncation of the pfcrt 3′-untranslated region just prior to putative polyadenylation sites resulted in a 10-fold decrease in luciferase expression levels. Using allelic exchange on a chloroquine-resistant line (7G8 from Brazil), this truncated 3′-untranslated region was inserted downstream of the pfcrt coding sequence, in the place of the endogenous 3′-untranslated region. The resulting pfcrt-modified “knockdown” clones displayed a marked decrease in pfcrt transcription and an estimated 30–40% decrease in PfCRT protein expression levels. [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation assays demonstrated up to a 40% decrease in chloroquine with or without verapamil IC50 levels of pfcrt knockdown clones, relative to the 7G8 parent. Single-cell photometric analyses were consistent with an altered intracellular pH in the knockdown clones, providing further evidence for a relationship between PfCRT, pH regulation, and chloroquine resistance.

The emergence and spread of CQ-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum has been identified as a major factor responsible for the recent increases in malaria mortality and morbidity (1Trape J.F. Pison G. Spiegel A. Enel C. Rogier C. Trends Parasitol. 2002; 18: 224-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In Africa alone, malaria-related mortality is estimated at a level of 0.5 to 2.0 million people per year, predominantly children under the age of five (2Greenwood B. Mutabingwa T.

An improved understanding of the genetic and pharmacological basis of chloroquine resistance (CQR) and its relationship to the mode of action of CQ can help stimulate and inform new approaches to tackling malaria.Central to the action of this drug is the process of hemoglobin degradation, thought to occur primarily in the digestive vacuole (DV) of the infected red blood cell (iRBC). This serves to provide amino acids and to deplete the host cell cytosol of hemoglobin, in order to sustain parasite intracellular growth (3Rosenthal P.J. Meshnick S.R. Sherman I.W.

This process liberates soluble heme (Fe(II) protoporphyrin IX), whose inherent toxicity is neutralized via its rapid incorporation, as an oxidized (Fe(III)) iron-propionic acid-coordinated hematin dimer, into a crystalline lattice known as hemozoin (4Banerjee R.

Verdier-Pinard D. Fidock D.A. Science. 2002; 298: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar).In a recent pfcrt allelic exchange study (26Sidhu A.B.S. Verdier-Pinard D. Fidock D.A. Science. 2002; 298: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), one notable finding was that expression of the mutant haplotypes in the recombinant lines resulted in acquisition of CQ IC50 values that were 70–90% of those observed with non-transformed reference lines expressing the same pfcrt haplotypes. One possible explanation is that mutant pfcrt can account for the bulk but not all of the CQR phenotype and that other genes are required to elevate the CQ IC50 values in the CQ-resistant lines. Another explanation is that the pfcrt-modified lines had lower CQ IC50 values as a result of their reduced levels of PfCRT protein expression (as observed by RNA and protein analysis (26Sidhu A.B.S. Verdier-Pinard D. Fidock D.A. Science. 2002; 298: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar)). This presumably stemmed from the genetic modification of the functional locus, which involved removal of the introns and manipulation of the 3′-untranslated region (UTR).To address the question of whether pfcrt expression levels can influence CQR independent of point mutations, we have implemented an allelic exchange strategy designed to introduce a truncated 3′-UTR into the functional pfcrt locus. This “knockdown” approach has been shown in higher eukaryotic systems to reduce levels of transcription and translation by decreasing mRNA stability and was used in Plasmodium berghei to assess the contribution of CS expression levels on sporozoite morphology (27Bashirullah A.

The resulting plasmids (named pHLcrt/1033, pHLcrt/625, and pHLcrt/148, respectively, Fig. 1A) were tested in luciferase reporter assays, using the technique of RBC pre-loading with plasmid DNA developed by Deitsch et al. (31Deitsch K. Driskill C. Wellems T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures rich in synchronized Dd2 trophozoites were obtained by successive rounds of sorbitol lysis of ring stage cultures (32Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). 24 h later, trophozoites were purified by Percoll-Sorbitol density gradient centrifugation (33Aley S.B. Sherwood J.A. Howard R.J. J. Exp.

Cultures were expanded on day 2 post-electroporation from 5 to 10 ml with the addition of another 109 RBC pre-loaded with 100 μg of plasmid DNA. The following day, parasites were harvested following RBC lysis with 1× PBS containing 0.15% saponin. Luciferase expression was assayed using the Dual-Luciferase® reporter system (Promega), and activity was measured in luminescence units using an AutoLumat LB953 luminometer (EG&G Berthold).Table IOligonucleotide primer sequencesPrimerSequence (5′ → 3′)aTarget-specific sequence is shown in uppercase.

Open table in a new tab Vector Construction and Parasite Transfection—The pfcrt allelic exchange fragment was PCR-amplified from 7G8 genomic DNA using the primer combination p4/p5. This yielded a 1.28-kb fragment comprising exons 8–13 as well as the proximal 148 bp of pfcrt 3′-UTR. This fragment was cloned into the plasmid pHDWT, which uses as a selectable marker the human dihydrofolate reductase (hdhfr) gene flanked by promoter and terminator elements from the hrp3 and hrp2 genes, respectively (34Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Wellems T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The resulting 7.1-kb transfection plasmid, pHD/pfcrtΔ 3′-UTR, was electroporated into 7G8 P. falciparum ring stage parasites. Plasmid-transfected parasites were selected by addition of 5 nm WR99210 to the culture medium starting 48 h post-transfection (34Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Wellems T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Parasite clones were obtained by limiting dilution and identified using the MALSTAT (Flow Inc.) assay reagent specific for P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (35Goodyer I.D. Taraschi T.F. Exp.

Plasmid integration into the 3′-UTR of pfcrt was detected by PCR using the primer combinations p6/p7 and p8/p9 (Table I and Fig. 1B). Integration into the hrp3 and hrp2 loci was assessed using the primer combinations p10/p11 and p12/p13, respectively. Amplification of non-recombinant, endogenous pfcrt sequence was assayed using the primers p6/p9. PCR conditions included a primer extension temperature of 62 °C to account for the high A-T content in P. falciparum genomic DNA (38Su X.Z. Wu Y. Sifri C.D. Wellems T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1574-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).For stage-specific Northern blots, cultures were doubly synchronized by sorbitol treatment. Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol® (Invitrogen) and solubilized in deionized formamide (39Kyes S. Pinches R. Newbold C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). RNA samples (10 μg per lane) were size-fractionated on a 1% agarose gel supplemented with 5 mm guanidine thiocyanate and transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled 1.3-kb pfcrt or 1.0-kb P. falciparum EF-1α cDNA probes, generated using the primers p14/p15 and p16/p17, respectively. Autoradiography images were captured using a Fuji film FLA2000 phosphorimaging device and quantified for data analysis.For reverse transcriptase-PCR assays, parasite lines were synchronized using successive rounds of gelatin flotation and sorbitol lysis. Cultures with >85% ring stage parasites were harvested by lysis with 0.15% saponin, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol®. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA, using the Superscript™ pre-amplification system (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT) priming.For Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI and HaeIII, electrophoresed overnight at 2.5 V/cm in 0.8% (w/v) agarose gels (∼1.5 μg of DNA/lane) alongside a dideoxygenin (DIG)-labeled DNA molecular mass ladder (Roche Applied Science), transferred to Nylon membranes, and UV cross-linked. A 0.9-kb region of pfcrt (exons 12 and 13, plus 0.6 kb of 3′-UTR sequence) and a 0.6-kb region of hdhfr were PCR-amplified using the primers p18/p19 and p20/p21, respectively, and labeled with DIG (Roche Applied Science). Hybridizations were performed at 60 °C, and membranes were washed at a maximum stringency of 0.3× SSC/0.1% SDS at 60 °C, prior to CDP-Star detection, and autoradiography.Western Blotting and Immunoelectron Microscopy—For whole parasite extracts, synchronized parasite cultures rich in late rings and early trophozoites were lysed using 0.15% saponin. Parasite pellets were washed in 1× PBS, resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and the proteins resolved on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels prior to being transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blots were performed using affinity-purified anti-PfCRT antibodies (19Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Talley A.K. Cooper R.A. Dzekunov S.M. Ferdig M.T. Ursos L.M. Sidhu A.B.S. Naude B. Deitsch K.

Autoradiographic data were analyzed by densitometry using Image version 1.6.2 (National Institutes of Health, available at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Percent reductions, presented as mean ± S.E., were determined by normalization of the data from each parasite line at the different loading amounts. DV extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (40Bray P.G. Janneh O. Raynes K.J. Mungthin M. Ginsburg H. Ward S.A. J.

Anti-PfCRT antibody-labeled samples were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Zeiss CEM 902 electron microscope.Drug Assays—In vitro drug responses were calculated from 72-h [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation assays (34Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Wellems T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Levels of incorporation were measured using a 1450 Microbeta liquid scintillation and luminescence counter (Wallac). Chloroquine (dihydrochloride “Aralen” formulation) was from Winthrop-Breon, whereas quinine (sulfate formulation) and mefloquine (hydrochloride formulation) were from Sigma. Drug inhibition concentrations were calculated by regression analysis of dose-response curves. Mann-Whitney t-tests were used to assess for statistical significance.Intracellular pH Measurements—Internal/external AO ratios were measured for individual intraerythrocytic parasites under constant perfusion, using single-cell photometric (SCP) analysis of synchronized trophozoites following previously described methodologies and using custom equipment (43Dzekunov S.M. Ursos L.M.B. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 107-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We stress these SCP experiments are not analogous to other published experiments that follow the response of trapped fluorophores via time-dependent laser confocal microscopy (44Bray P.G. Saliba K.J.

These data have been interpreted in previous reports (19Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Talley A.K. Cooper R.A. Dzekunov S.M. Ferdig M.T. Ursos L.M. Sidhu A.B.S. Naude B. Deitsch K. Su X.-z. Wootton J.C.

Dzekunov, A. B. S. Sidhu, D. A. Fidock, and P. D. Roepe, unpublished data. Nonetheless, AO ratios have been suggested by others to be an unreliable marker for DV pH (44Bray P.G. Saliba K.J.

Thus, so long as this controversy remains unsettled, in the present work we avoid explicit calculation of DV pH using these ratio data.To directly test whether the present SCP experiments monitored AO localizing within the DV, co-localization studies of AO and hemozoin were performed using laser scanning confocal microscopy (cf. Fig. 5C, under “Results”). Laser confocal images were acquired in “z-axis series” mode using an Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope and an Olympus UPlanApo 100× oil immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.35) as detailed elsewhere. 2T. Bennett, A. D. Kosar, L. M. B. Ursos, S. Dzekunov, A. B. S. Sidhu, D. A. Fidock, and P. D. Roepe, unpublished data. In brief, the 488-nm line of an argon laser (20% output) was used for excitation, and we acquired a set of 15 conjugate transmittance and fluorescence images upon successive 0.2-μm displacements along the z-axis. We first focused transmittance in the absence of laser illumination until hemozoin was clearly visible within the center of the synchronized late stage trophozoite parasite DV, thus putting the focal plane within the DV. We then defined this z-axis position as 0. A series of conjugate fluorescence and Nomarski transmittance images were then rapidly acquired in successive 0.2-μm z-axis displacements relative to 0, such that we were sure to scan through the parasite. After archiving the image pairs, we determined the largest hemozoin diameter in the Nomarski transmittance set via histogram analysis. The conjugate fluorescence image partner to this transmittance image was then subjected to histogram analysis using the same parameters. Each image (transmittance and fluorescence versions) defined the same ∼0.25-μm-thick optically defined slice (slightly larger than 0.2 μm due to the pinhole setting) corresponding to the DV of a late stage trophozoite. All fluorescent light recorded from this slice thus resided within 0.12 μminthe + or – direction relative to the visualized hemozoin and within the x and y dimensions show"
https://openalex.org/W2059983642,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) is a nuclear receptor for eicosanoids that promotes differentiation of human epithelial and mesenchymal cells in vitro and in vivo. PPARγ was proposed as a target for drug-induced differentiation therapy of cancer. Caveolin-1 is a constituent of plasma membrane caveolae in epithelial cells that is often downregulated upon oncogenic transformation. Caveolin-1 has growth-inhibitory activities and its disruption is sufficient to induce transformation in fibroblasts. Herein we have tested the hypothesis that caveolins are transcriptional target genes for PPARγ. In human HT-29 colon carcinoma cells, thiazolidinedione PPARγ ligands increased the levels of caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 proteins two to fivefold in a concentration-dependent manner within 24 h. In human MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells, nonthiazolidinedione PPARγ ligands elevated caveolin-2 protein three to fourfold, while the thiazoli-dinediones were less effective. Caveolin-1 mRNA levels were found to be upregulated by PPARγ ligands already after 3 h in both the cell lines. Ectopic expression of a dominant-negative PPARγ construct attenuated ligand-induced upregulation of caveolins in both HT-29 and HEK-293T cells, indicating that ligand action is mediated by PPARγ. Ligand-treated MCF-7 cells exhibited a differentiated phenotype, as evinced by analysis of cell-specific differentiation markers: protein levels of maspin were elevated and perinuclear lipid droplets accumulated. In contrast, in HT-29 cells, caveolin expression was not correlated with differentiation. Interestingly, PPARγ partially cofractionated in lipid rafts and could be coimmunoprecipitated from cell lysates with caveolin-1, indicating that PPARγ and caveolin-1 may coexist in a complex. Our data indicate that PPARγ participates in the regulation of caveolin gene expression in human carcinoma cells and suggest that caveolin-1 may mediate some of the phenotypic changes induced by this nuclear receptor in cancer cells. These findings may have potentially important functional implications in the context of cancer differentiation therapy and multidrug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2045917022,"DLC-1 (deleted in liver cancer) gene is frequently deleted in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, little is known about the genetic status and the expression of this gene in gastric cancer. In this study, Northern and Southern analysis showed that seven of nine human gastric cancer cell lines did not express DLC-1 mRNA, but contained the DLC-1 gene. To identify the mechanism of the loss of DLC-1 mRNA expression in these cell lines, we investigated the methylation status of DLC-1 gene by using methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and Southern blot, and found that five of seven DLC-1 nonexpressing gastric cancer cell lines were methylated in the DLC-1 CpG island. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) induced DLC-1 mRNA expression in the gastric cancer cell lines that have the methylated alleles. Studies using SNU-601 cell line with methylated DLC-1 alleles revealed that nearly all CpG sites within DLC-1 CpG island were methylated, and that the in vitro methylation of the DLC-1 promoter region is enough to repress DLC-1 mRNA expression, regardless of the presence of transcription factors capable of inducing this gene. In all, 29 of 97 (30%) primary gastric cancers were also shown to be methylated, demonstrating that methylation of the DLC-1 CpG island is not uncommon in gastric cancer. In addition, we demonstrated that DLC-1 mRNA expression was induced, and an increase in the level of acetylated H3 and H4 was detected by the treatment with trichostatin A (TSA) in two DLC-1 nonexpressing cell lines that have the unmethylated alleles. Taken together, the results of our study suggest that the transcriptional silencing of DLC-1, by epigenetic mechanism, may be involved in gastric carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2087503836,"Interaction of the platelet GPIb-V-IX complex with surface immobilized von Willebrand factor (vWf) is required for the capture of circulating platelets and their ensuing activation. In previous work, it was found that GPIb/vWf-mediated platelet adhesion triggers Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, leading to cytoskeletal reorganization and filopodia extension. Despite the potential functional importance of GPIb-induced cytoskeletal changes, the signaling mechanisms regulating this process have remained ill-defined. The studies presented here demonstrate an important role for phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent phosphoinositide turnover for GPIb-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling. This is supported by the findings that the vWf-GPIb interaction induced a small increase in inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and that treating platelets with the IP3 receptor antagonist APB-2 or the PLC inhibitor U73122 blocked cytosolic Ca2+ flux and platelet shape change. Normal shape change was observed in Gαq–/– mouse platelets, excluding a role for PLCβ isoforms in this process. However, decreased shape change and Ca2+ mobilization were observed in mice lacking PLCγ2, demonstrating that this isotype played an important, albeit incomplete, role in GPIb signaling. The signaling pathways utilized by GPIb involved one or more members of the Src kinase family as platelet shape change and Ca2+ flux were inhibited by the Src kinase inhibitors PP1 and PP2. Strikingly, shape change and Ca2+ release occurred independently of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing receptors, because these platelet responses were normal in human platelets treated with the anti-FcγRIIA blocking monoclonal antibody IV.3 and in mouse platelets deficient in the FcRγ chain. Taken together, these studies define an important role for PLCγ2 in GPIb signaling linked to platelet shape change. Moreover, they demonstrate that GPIb-dependent calcium flux and cytoskeletal reorganization involves a signaling pathway distinct from that utilized by ITAM-containing receptors.

Platelets are specialized blood cells that display unique adhesive properties relevant to hemostasis and thrombosis. Platelet adhesion is critically dependent on the synergistic interaction between multiple platelet receptors and adhesive ligands, with the involvement of specific receptor-ligand pairs dependent on the prevailing blood flow conditions (1Ruggeri Z.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar).

Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). In addition to its adhesive function, the GPIb-V-IX complex also plays an important role in regulating the organization of the platelet cytoskeleton (3Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For example, it has long been recognized from the study of platelets deficient in GPIb-V-IX (Bernard-Soulier syndrome) that this complex is important for maintaining the compact structure of the membrane skeleton, due at least in part, to the physical linkage between GPIb and actin-binding protein (ABP) 280 (ABP-280 or filamin-1) (4Kanaji T. Russell S. Ware J. Blood. 2002; 100: 2102-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). More recently it has been demonstrated that vWf engagement of GPIb can induce cytoskeletal reorganization (5Yuan Y. Kulkarni S. Ulsemer P. Cranmer S.L. Yap C.L. Nesbitt W.S. Harper I. Mistry N. Dopheide S.M. Hughan S.C. Williamson D. de la Salle C. Salem H.H. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Biol.

The physiological importance of vWf in inducing cytoskeletal reorganization has previously been highlighted from the study of von Willebrand disease pigs (7Reddick R.L. Griggs T.R. Lamb M.A. Brinkhous K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5076-5079Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Platelets from these animals adhere to sites of vascular injury; however, they exhibit defective cytoskeletal remodeling leading to reduced filopodial extension and poor spreading. Despite the potential importance of GPIb in initiating platelet activation, the mechanisms by which GPIb transduces signals linked to cytoskeletal remodeling remains incompletely understood. We have previously demonstrated a potentially important role for intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in this process (5Yuan Y. Kulkarni S. Ulsemer P. Cranmer S.L. Yap C.L. Nesbitt W.S. Harper I. Mistry N. Dopheide S.M. Hughan S.C. Williamson D. de la Salle C. Salem H.H. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36241-36251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar); however, to date, the proximal signaling molecules utilized by GPIb-V-IX to induce cytosolic Ca2+ flux have not been identified. The GPIb-V-IX receptor consists of four protein subunits belonging to the leucine-rich repeat superfamily, GPIbα, GPIbβ, GPIX, and GPV (8Berndt M.C. Shen Y. Dopheide S.M. Gardiner E.E. Andrews R.K. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The receptor intracellular region does not have catalytic activity, nor does it bind GTP-binding proteins or become phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases. Previous studies have suggested that GPIbα may signal directly as a consequence of its association with the cytoskeletal structural protein, actin-binding protein (ABP-280) (3Cunningham J.G.

Blood. 2000; 96: 577-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, GPIb may transduce signals indirectly through the physical association with the ITAM-bearing receptors, FcRγ chain (15Falati S. Edmead C.E. Poole A.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1648-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wu Y. Suzuki-Inoue K. Satoh K. Asazuma N. Yatomi Y. Berndt M.C. Ozaki Y. Blood. 2001; 97: 3836-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), or FcγRIIA (17Sullam P.M. Hyun W.C. Szollosi J. Dong J. Foss W.M. Lopez J.A. J. Biol.

FcRγ and FcγRIIA receptor signaling is initiated by Src kinase-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors' ITAM motif, leading to the recruitment of p72 syk , PI 3-kinase, and the adaptor proteins (LAT, SLP-76, and vav), which ultimately promote the activation of phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2). The subsequent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate, leading to IP3 generation and intracellular calcium release is a critical event for efficient platelet activation (19Watson S.P. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Gratacap M.P. Payrastre B. Viala C. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24314-24321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A consensus model for GPIb signaling has yet to emerge, despite intense investigation from a number of groups. In fact, there remains considerable controversy over a number of basic aspects with regards to GPIb signaling, including the contribution of direct and indirect pathways for platelet activation. One possible reason for the discrepancies in results from different studies reflects the variability in experimental approaches used to examine this process. For example, a wide variety of ligands (venom peptides, soluble human or bovine vWf, recombinant vWf fragments, and immobilized vWf), artificial modulators (ristocetin and botrocetin), cell types (human and mouse platelets, GPIb-V-IX-transfected CHO and K562 cell lines), and functional assays (suspension-based aggregation studies, shear-induced platelet aggregation, and static or flow-based adhesion assays) have been utilized to examine GPIb signaling. In many of these studies it is unclear what the direct contribution of the cytoplasmic tails of the GPIb-V-IX complex are for signal generation relative to indirect signaling mediated through the FcRγ chain and FcγRIIA receptor, soluble agonist release, and integrin αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling. Furthermore, it is not always clear that the end-point used to examine GPIb signaling is in fact a direct functional response linked to this receptor. We have previously established that the vWf-GPIb interaction per se is sufficient to induce cytosolic calcium spikes that are necessary for platelet cytoskeletal remodeling, independent of integrin αIIbβ3 (5Yuan Y. Kulkarni S. Ulsemer P. Cranmer S.L. Yap C.L. Nesbitt W.S. Harper I. Mistry N. Dopheide S.M. Hughan S.C. Williamson D. de la Salle C. Salem H.H. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36241-36251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the current study we have utilized platelet shape change and cytosolic calcium transients as bona fide GPIb-dependent responses to examine the proximal signaling events linked to this receptor. Through the use of various pharmacological inhibitors and knock-out mouse models linked to PLC signaling, our studies have demonstrated an important role for Src kinase-dependent activation of the PLCγ2 isoform in GPIb-dependent calcium flux and cytoskeletal remodeling. In contrast to many other studies, our results do not support an important role for the FcRγ chain and FcγRIIA receptors in GPIb signaling.

Human vWf (HvWf) was purified from plasma cryoprecipitate according to the method of Montgomery and Zimmerman (21Montgomery R.R. Zimmerman T.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1498-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and human fibrinogen was from Kabi (Stockholm, Sweden). Apyrase was purified from potatoes as previously described (22Cazenave J.P. Hemmendinger S. Beretz A. Sutter-Bay A. Launay J. Ann. Biol. Clin. 1983; 41: 167-179PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse Strains—C57BL/6 Gαq-deficient (Gαq–/–) and wild type (Gαq+/+) mouse colonies were established at the animal facilities of the Etablissement Français du Sang-Alsace by breeding the Gαq heterozygotes (Gαq+/–) provided by Prof. Stephan Offermanns (Universität Heidelberg, Germany) (23Offermanns S.

Cell Line—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, expressing the GPIb-IX complex, were established as described previously (26Ulsemer P. Strassel C. Baas M.J. Salamero J. Chasserot-Golaz S. Cazenave J.P. De La Salle C. Lanza F. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 295-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelet Preparation—Blood was drawn from healthy volunteers who had not taken an anti-platelet medication in preceding 2 weeks and collected in an acid citrate dextrose anticoagulant. Platelets were isolated by sequential centrifugation of the blood and washed as previously described (22Cazenave J.P. Hemmendinger S. Beretz A. Sutter-Bay A. Launay J. Ann. Biol. Clin. 1983; 41: 167-179PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were finally resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (12 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose) containing human serum albumin and apyrase (0.02 unit/ml) and kept at 37 °C. Aspirinated platelets were obtained by treating cells with 1 mm aspirin for 15 min, prior to final suspension in Tyrode's buffer. Washed mouse platelets were prepared according to the method described by Moog et al. (27Moog S. Mangin P. Lenain N. Strassel C. Ravanat C. Schuhler S. Freund M. Santer M. Kahn M. Nieswandt B. Gachet C. Cazenave J.P. Lanza F. Blood. 2001; 98: 1038-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Mouse blood was taken from the abdominal aorta of anesthetized animals and collected in an acid citrate dextrose anticoagulant. Platelet Aggregation Studies—Aggregation was performed using a dual-channel Payton aggregometer (Payton Associates, Scarborough, Ontario, Canada). Platelets (3 × 108 platelets/ml) were stimulated at 37 °C by collagen (1.25 μg/ml) in the presence of human fibrinogen (275 μg/ml), in a final volume of 500 μl. Aggregation was initiated by stirring the platelet mixture at 1100 rpm. When vWf-induced platelet agglutination was examined, aspirinated platelets (3 × 108 platelets/ml) were pre-treated with cFab 7E3 (20 μg/ml) for 10 min or with EDTA (5 mm), then stirred in the presence of human vWf (20 μg/ml) and ristocetin (1 mg/ml). In control studies, the pharmacological activity of the IP3 receptor inhibitor, 2-APB, was confirmed by complete inhibition of thrombin (1 unit/ml)-induced platelet aggregation at 50 μm. The ability of IV.3 (5 μg/ml) to block FcγRIIA function was confirmed by inhibition of heat-aggregated immunoglobulins (800 μg/ml)-induced platelet aggregations. Cell Adhesion and Morphology Analysis—Human platelet adhesion studies were performed as previously described (5Yuan Y. Kulkarni S. Ulsemer P. Cranmer S.L. Yap C.L. Nesbitt W.S. Harper I. Mistry N. Dopheide S.M. Hughan S.C. Williamson D. de la Salle C. Salem H.H. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36241-36251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, platelets (2 × 107/ml) in Tyrode's buffer were treated with c7E3 Fab (20 μg/ml), then allowed to adhere to a HvWf (10 μg/ml) matrix for 30 min at 37 °C, in the presence of 2 units apyrase. Where indicated, platelets were also preincubated for 10 min with the inhibitors of phospholipase C (U73122 (10 μm)), IP3 receptor (2-APB (20 μm)), Src kinases (PP1 (10 μm) and PP2 (10 μm)), and FcγRIIA blocking Ab IV.3 (5 μg/ml), prior to application to vWf matrices. In some studies, the treated platelets were then allowed to adhere to vWf in the presence of Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (40 nm) to induce extracellular Ca2+ influx. Non-adherent cells were removed, and adherent cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min. In control studies, platelets were fixed in suspension then applied onto a vWf matrix. To examine the cell morphology, the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Mowiol 4-88 solution (France Biochem, Meudon, France), and platelets subjected to differential interference contrast microscopy (Leica TCSNT) (63× objective). Alternatively, the fixed adherent platelets were stained with TRITC-phalloidin (2 μg/ml) for 30 min and then subjected to fluorescence microscopy (UV illumination at 570 nm, Leica DMDL microscope) (63× objective). The number of adherent cells was scored in five to eight random fields. Platelet shape change was defined by the transformation of platelet morphology from discoid with no filopodial projection to spherical with filopodial projections greater than 0.2 μm in length. When adhesion assays were performed using mouse platelets (3 × 107/ml) or CHO cells (1 × 106/ml), identical experimental conditions were used except that botrocetin (2 μg/ml) was present to support cell adhesion to HvWf, and the integrin-vWf interaction was prevented by the addition of EDTA (5 mm) or c7E3 Fab (20 μg/ml), respectively. Scanning Electron Microscopy—Adherent platelets were fixed for 45 min with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3, 305 mosm/kg) containing 2% sucrose. The fixed cells were washed three times in 0.9% saline and dehydrated sequentially in increasing concentrations of ethanol solutions. Samples were air-dried with 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazan, sputtered with gold, and examined under an Hitachi S-800 scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) (5 kV) (28Ohlmann P. Eckly A. Freund M. Cazenave J.P. Offermanns S. Gachet C. Blood. 2000; 96: 2134-2139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Studies—Washed platelets (2 × 108/ml) were treated with c7E3 Fab (20 μg/ml) and allowed to adhere to immobilized HvWf (10 μg/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C. Where indicated, platelets were also pretreated with the inhibitor of Src family kinases, PP2 (5 μm), prior to adhesion. The adherent platelets were lysed in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 158 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm benzamidine), scrapped off, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with an anti-PLCγ2 polyclonal Ab (4 μg) in the presence of 30 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed and subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE under a reducing condition, immunoblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY-20 or an anti-PLCγ2 Ab, and developed with Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Dupont) as previously described (29Yuan Y. Dopheide S.M. Ivanidis C. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21847-21854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Quantitation of IP3 Levels—Washed platelets (2 × 109/ml) were treated with cFab 7E3 (20 μg/ml) for 10 min, then aggregated with vWf (20 μg/ml) in the presence of ristocetin (1 mg/ml) for the indicated period of time. Platelets were then lysed, and IP3 in the total cell lysates quantitated using a commercial IP3 assay kit (Amersham Biosciences, UK) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The IP3 levels were determined using a standard curve established using known amounts of IP3. Analysis of Cytosolic Ca2 + Flux—The platelet intracellular Ca2+ changes were monitored according to the previously detailed method (30Yap C.L. Hughan S.C. Cranmer S.L. Nesbitt W.S. Rooney M.M. Giuliano S. Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41377-41388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Washed human platelets were loaded with two membrane-permeable Ca2+ indicator dyes, Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-AM-1 (1.25 μm) and Fura Red AM (1 μm), for 20 min at 37 °C. The Ca2+ dye-loaded platelets were treated with c7E3 Fab (20 μg/ml) and then allowed to adhere to a vWf (10 μm) matrix in the presence of ristocetin (1 mg/ml), under static conditions. The changes in fluorescence ratio of Oregon Green to Fura Red was then measured after 10 min of adhesion using confocal microscopy (1 frame/s) and converted to intracellular Ca2+ concentrations as previously described (31Nesbitt W.S. Giuliano S. Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Harper I.S. Jackson S.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1151-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ concentrations in resting platelets were also determined by measuring the fluorescence ratio (mean ratio = 0.6, n = 390) in platelets applied onto a non-reactive (10% human serum-coated) surface. A transient Ca2+ signal was defined as a change in fluorescence ratio greater than two standard deviations (2σ = 0.38, n = 390) above the mean fluorescence ratio (the mean fluorescence ratio in resting platelets). Where indicated, platelets were preincubated with the inhibitors of PLC, U73122 (1 μm); of IP3 receptor, 2-APB (20 μm); of Src kinases, PP2 (5 μm); or of FcγRIIA, IV.3 mAb (5 μg/ml), prior to adhesion to vWf. When these studies were performed on mouse platelets, adhesion assays were carried out in the presence of botrocetin (1 μg/ml). EDTA (1 mm) was also present to prevent the integrin αIIbβ3-vWf interaction and extracellular Ca2+ influx. Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of differences between means was evaluated using Student's t test for paired samples, and p values of less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. The vWf-GPIb Interaction Induces IP3 Formation—We have previously demonstrated that vWf engagement of GPIb induces transient Ca2+ spikes that initiate cytoskeletal remodeling (5Yuan Y. Kulkarni S. Ulsemer P. Cranmer S.L. Yap C.L. Nesbitt W.S. Harper I. Mistry N. Dopheide S.M. Hughan S.C. Williamson D. de la Salle C. Salem H.H. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36241-36251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In platelets, release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores is primarily mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), generated through the hydrolysis of the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate, by one or more phospholipase C (PLC) isoforms. To date, there is limited evidence that the vWf-GPIb interaction can induce PLC activation and IP3 generation in platelets (16Wu Y. Suzuki-Inoue K. Satoh K. Asazuma N. Yatomi Y. Berndt M.C. Ozaki Y. Blood. 2001; 97: 3836-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, we initially quantified IP3 levels in platelets aggregated by vWf (10 μg/ml) and ristocetin (1 mg/ml), in the presence of the anti-integrin αIIbβ3 antibody c7E3 Fab. IP3 levels were determined on platelet aggregates rather than from adhesion assays, because we were unable to harvest sufficient quantities of platelet lysates from the latter assays to reliably detect changes in IP3. Stimulation of platelets in suspension with vWf/ristocetin resulted in a transient increase in IP3 levels from a resting concentration (1.1 ± 1.4 pmol/109 platelets) up to a peak of 5.2 pmol/109 platelets after 10 s of stimulation. By 30 s, IP3 levels had returned to basal levels (Fig. 1A). A similar transient increase in IP3 was also observed in Glanzmann thrombasthenic platelets, confirming the lack of involvement of integrin αIIbβ3 (Fig. 1A). In all experiments, the increase in IP3 induced by the vWf-GPIb interaction was weak relative to other agonists, with thrombin inducing peak IP3 levels as high as 90 pmol/109 platelets (Fig. 1B and data not shown). To investigate the relationship between IP3 generation and calcium mobilization during platelet adhesion on vWf, platelet Ca2+ levels were monitored using a quantitative dual-dye ratiometric assay, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” As demonstrated in Fig. 1C, the Ca2+ concentration in resting platelets was low. Following adhesion to vWf, ∼60% of adherent platelets elicited transient Ca2+ spikes ranging from 50–200 nm (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the low IP3 levels, GPIb-dependent Ca2+ signals were small relative to those induced by thrombin (up to 2000 nm). Platelet adhesion on vWf, in the presence of integrin αIIbβ3 antagonists, results in morphological alterations characterized by sphere forming of the cell body and extension of multiple filopodia (5Yuan Y. Kulkarni S. Ulsemer P. Cranmer S.L. Yap C.L. Nesbitt W.S. Harper I. Mistry N. Dopheide S.M. Hughan S.C. Williamson D. de la Salle C. Salem H.H. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36241-36251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To further establish the relationship between IP3 generation, Ca2+ flux, and platelet shape change on vWf, the effects of the IP3 receptor antagonist, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (APB-2), were examined. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, APB-2 decreased the proportion of platelets undergoing shape change from 85% in control platelets to less than 20% in treated platelets (Fig. 2, A and B). Pretreating platelets with APB-2 (20 μm) completely abolished GPIb-induced Ca2+ spikes (Fig. 2C). In control studies, we confirmed that APB-2 was not having nonspecific inhibitory effects on platelets, because stimulating APB-2-treated platelets with low dose Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (40 nm) restored platelet shape change (Fig. 2, A and B). This effect of ABP-2 was not caused by its blockade of extracellular Ca2+ entry, as GPIb-induced Ca2+ mobilization occurred in the presence of the extracellular Ca2+ chelator EDTA (5Yuan Y. Kulkarni S. Ulsemer P. Cranmer S.L. Yap C.L. Nesbitt W.S. Harper I. Mistry N. Dopheide S.M. Hughan S.C. Williamson D. de la Salle C. Salem H.H. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Biol.

Involvement of PLC in Platelet Cytoskeletal Reorganization Triggered by the vWf-GPIb-V-IX Interaction—To investigate further the potential involvement of PLC in GPIb signaling, we examined the effects of the PLC antagonist, U73122 (32Bleasdale J.E.

Plasmodium falciparum causes one of the most life-threatening infectious diseases of humans. Malaria is estimated to be responsible for up to 2 million deaths per year. The pathogenesis of the disease is associated with the intracellular erythrocytic cycle of the parasite involving repeated rounds of invasion, growth, and schizogony. P. falciparum invades enucleated (mature) erythrocytes, which are devoid of organelles and lack a biosynthetic and secretory machinery and are, thus, metabolically relatively inert. The parasite feeds on the host cell cytosol and degrades about 75% of the hemoglobin (1Loria P. Miller S. Foley M. Tilley L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The released amino acids are incorporated into parasite proteins and also appear to be available for energy metabolism. Proteolysis is thought to be essential for parasite survival because P. falciparum has a limited capacity for de novo amino acid synthesis (2Sherman I.W. Bull. W. H. O. 1977; 55: 265-276PubMed Google Scholar). However, the proteolytic degradation of hemoglobin also produces heme (ferriprotoporphyrin IX (FP) 1The abbreviations used are: FP, ferriprotoporphyrin IX; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EXP-1, P. falciparum exported protein 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HRP, histidine-rich protein; HRP2, P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2; KAHRP, P. falciparum knob-associated histidine-rich protein; MAHRP-1, P. falciparum membrane-associated histidine-rich protein 1; OPD, ortho-phenylene diamine; PfSBP1, P. falciparum skeleton-binding protein 1; PfEMP1, P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HTPBS, human tonicity phosphate-buffered saline.).

Nature. 1992; 355: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 6Egan T.J. Combrinck J.M. Egan J. Hearne G.R. Marques H.M. Ntenteni S. Sewell B.T. Smith P.J. Taylor D. van Schalkwyk D.A. Walden J.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that this crystallization process is initiated and accelerated in vitro by parasite-derived histidine-rich proteins (7Sullivan Jr., D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 8Papalexis V. Siomos M.A. Campanale N. Guo X. Kocak G. Foley M. Tilley L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the inhibition of hemozoin formation is believed to underlie the mode of action of chloroquine in vivo (9Ziegler J. Linck R. Wright D.W. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 171-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that non-enzymatic degradation, including reactions with H2O2 and glutathione may contribute to heme detoxification (1Loria P. Miller S. Foley M. Tilley L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 10Ginsburg H. Famin O. Zhang J. Krugliak M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and that histidine-rich proteins may modulate these processes (8Papalexis V. Siomos M.A. Campanale N. Guo X. Kocak G. Foley M. Tilley L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Several parasite-encoded histidine-rich proteins (HRP) have been described, of which P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) is one of the best characterized. This soluble protein is found in the food vacuole but also in the erythrocyte cytosol (8Papalexis V. Siomos M.A. Campanale N. Guo X. Kocak G. Foley M. Tilley L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11Howard R.J. Uni S. Aikawa M. Aley S.B. Leech J.H. Lew A.M. Wellems T.E. Rener J. Taylor D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Earlier studies suggested that HRP2 is ingested by the parasite's cytostome from the red cell together with hemoglobin and thereby delivered to the food vacuole by bulk endocytosis (7Sullivan Jr., D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, recent studies show that although ∼75% of the hemoglobin is ingested by the parasite, more than 90% of HRP2 remains in the erythrocyte cytosol (12Akompong T. Kadekoppala M. Harrison T. Oksman A. Goldberg D.E. Fujioka H. Samuel B.U. Sullivan D. Haldar K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28923-28933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cytosolic HRP2 seems to concentrate mainly near the periphery of the erythrocyte, suggesting that it may not diffuse freely through the erythrocyte cytoplasm and could thereby avoid ingestion. These recent findings suggest the possibility that HRP2 could play a role in the detoxification of the by-products of hemoglobin degradation in the host cytoplasm. Recently, it has been shown that HRP2 modulates the redox activity of FP and that the HRP2·FP complex may have antioxidant properties (13Mashima R. Tilley L. Siomos M.A. Papalexis V. Raftery M.J. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14514-14520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Hence, the location of HRP2 near the erythrocyte membrane may function to protect the host membrane from oxidative stress and, thus, prevent premature host cell lysis. The P. falciparum knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP) is another well characterized HRP. KAHRP is essential for the formation of knob-like protuberances on the surface of infected erythrocytes. These knobs act as platforms for the presentation of P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP1), which is responsible for adherence of parasitized erythrocytes to vascular endothelial cells (14Crabb B.S. Cooke B.M. Reeder J.C. Waller R.F. Caruana S.R. Davern K.M. Wickham M.E. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L. Cowman A.F. Cell. 1997; 89: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). This adhesion and subsequent accumulation of infected erythrocytes in the microvasculature are pivotal events in the pathogenesis of P. falciparum malaria, and these processes are considered to represent major virulence factors. On route to the erythrocyte membrane, KAHRP is transiently located at the Maurer's clefts, a parasite-derived vesicle-like structure in the erythrocyte cytosol (15Wickham M.E. Rug M. Ralph S.A. Klonis N. McFadden G.I. Tilley L. Cowman A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5636-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Other proteins have also been shown to be associated with Maurer's clefts, including PfEMP3 (15Wickham M.E. Rug M. Ralph S.A. Klonis N. McFadden G.I. Tilley L. Cowman A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5636-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 16Waterkeyn J.G. Wickham M.E. Davern K.M. Cooke B.M. Coppel R.L. Reeder J.C. Culvenor J.G. Waller R.F. Cowman A.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2813-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), Pf322 (17Hinterberg K. Scherf A. Gysin J. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Mazie J.C. da Silva L.P. Mattei D. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and P. falciparum skeleton-binding protein 1 (PfSBP1) (18Blisnick T. Morales Betoulle M.E. Barale J.C. Uzureau P. Berry L. Desroses S. Fujioka H. Mattei D. Braun B.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these cleft structures may act as an intermediate trafficking compartment and may play a critical role in the organization and sorting of parasite proteins. In a host cell such as the erythrocyte, which is devoid of any organelles or trafficking machinery, such parasite-derived structures represent an interesting target for possible intervention. Here we describe a novel P. falciparum membrane-associated histidine-rich protein, MAHRP-1, which localizes to the Maurer's clefts. We identified the sequence encoding MAHRP-1 in a ring stage-specific cDNA library (19Spielmann T. Beck H.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and show that MAHRP-1 is exclusively expressed in the early erythrocytic stages but is present throughout the cycle. MAHRP-1 contains a predicted transmembrane domain and a polymorphic cluster of histidine-rich repeats. MAHRP-1 binds FP in vitro in a specific manner, promoting the peroxidase-like activity of FP and enhancing the degradation of FP by H2O2. These data suggest that MAHRP-1 might play an important role in generating the Maurer's clefts or in protecting proteins within these structures against the noxious effects of FP and reactive oxygen species. FP (porcine), bovine serum albumin (essentially fatty acid free (BSA)), saponin, and ortho-phenylenediamine (OPD) were obtained from Sigma. Albumax was provided by Invitrogen. All primers were manufactured by Invitrogen. Escherichia coli BL21 strain and plasmid vector pGEX-6P-2 were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. E. coli TunerDE3pLacI was obtained from Novagen. The sequencing vector pGEM-T was provided by Promega, Wallisellen, CH. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) was expressed from the pGEX-6P-vector and purified as described for the recombinant MAHRP-1c. Secondary antibodies for immunoblot analyses were goat anti-mouse IgG (γ-chain specific) alkaline phosphatase-labeled (Sigma) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (heavy and light chain)-alkaline phosphatase-labeled (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence labeling were goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes) and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma or Dako). Rabbit antisera recognizing KAHRP, PfEMP3, P. falciparum exported protein-1 (EXP-1), and PfEMP1 were kindly donated by Kathy Davern and Dr. Jacqui Waterkeyn, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, and Prof. Klaus Lingelbach, Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany, and Professor Chris Newbold, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK. In Silico Analyses—One of the ring stage-specific gene fragments reported in Spielmann and Beck (19Spielmann T. Beck H.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) coded for a histidine-rich protein (AJ290925). Query of the malaria sequence data base (www.plasmodb.org) returned the complete gene, now referred to as mahrp1. The predicted intron sequence was removed from the complete gene sequence to obtain the open reading frame. This was translated into amino acid sequence using ExPASy Molecular Biology Server (www.expasy.ch). Protein primary structure analysis was performed using www.psort.nibb.ac.uk. Amplification and Sequencing of Full-length MAHRP-1—The sequence coding for MAHRP-1 was amplified from a collection of DNA derived from the following P. falciparum strains: 3D7, K1, SN250, ITG2F6, IFA18, Mad20. Primers used for amplification by PCR were: forward primer, 5′-GTTCCTACTGTTGGAACAGTTCC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CTAATTTTGCTTTTTGGCAATCACATGG-3′. The PCR products were cloned into the sequencing vector pGEM-T. The commercially available SP6 and T7 primers were used for sequencing reactions. Expression of Recombinant MAHRP-1c—The sequence coding for the C-terminal domain of MAHRP-1 was PCR-amplified from both 3D7 and ITG2F6 genomic DNA using primers 5′-CAGATCAAGAGTGAACATAAAGCC-3′ and 5′-CTAATTTTGCTTTTTGGCAATCACATGG-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the SmaI restriction site 3′ of GST in pGEX-6P-2 by cycle restriction ligation to yield the plasmid pMAHRP-1c. E. coli BL21strain (for the 3D7 fusion protein) and E. coli Tuner DE3pLacI (for the ITG2F6 fusion protein) were transformed with plasmid pMAHRP-1c and used for expression of recombinant MAHRP-1c. Luria broth was inoculated with E. coli harboring pMAHRP-1c and cultured overnight at 37 °C containing one (for 3D7) or both (ITG2F6) of the following antibiotics: ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml). Fresh Luria broth containing antibiotics was inoculated with the overnight culture at a dilution of 1:10 and cultured at 37 °C to an A 600 of 1.0. Expression of MAHRP-1c was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Induced cultures were grown for 3–6 h at 37 °C. Purification of Recombinant MAHRP-1c—Induced cultures were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (2 mg/ml lysozyme, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml DNase) in 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4 (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) and lysed by sonication. The supernatant containing the soluble GST fusion protein was purified using the Bulk GST Purification Module (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. Purity and integrity of the protein was checked on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE. 500 ml of culture yielded ∼2–4 mg of recombinant protein. To test whether the histidine residues could also be used for further purification, an aliquot of the protein preparation was run over a Ni2+ chelate column (Qiagen) according to the supplier's protocol (data not shown). Production of Specific Sera—C57BL6 mice were immunized subcutaneously with 10 μg of recombinant MAHRP-1c excised from polyacrylamide gels. Mice were boosted three times within 7 weeks and bled 1 week after the last immunization. Specificity of sera was tested on Western blots with recombinant MAHRP-1c, recombinant GST, and parasite protein extracts. Four different mice antisera were generated, each of which gave equivalent reactivity profiles. Western Blot Analyses—Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond-C extra, Amersham Biosciences) for 1.5 h using a Trans-Blot semi-dry electroblotter (Bio-Rad). The membrane was washed twice for 5 min in TNT (0.1 m Tris/HCl, 1.5 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0) and blocked in TNT and 5% milk powder overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibody was diluted in 15 ml of TNT and 1% milk powder, and the secondary antibody was diluted in 15 ml of TNT and 0.1% milk powder. The membrane was washed 4 times in TNT and twice in Tris buffer (0.1 m Tris/HCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.5). The membrane was stained in 20 ml of Tris buffer containing 200 μl of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (15 mg/ml) and 200 μl of nitro blue tetrazolium (30 mg/ml 70% N,N-dimethylformamide) for 15 min and then washed in distilled H2O. Antibodies for immunoblot analyses were used at following dilutions: mouse anti-MAHRP-1c, 1/1000; rabbit anti-KAHRP, 1/200; rabbit anti-HRP2, 1/200; goat anti-mouse, 1:2000; goat anti-rabbit 1/30000. Parasite Culture and Preparation of Parasite Protein Extracts— P. falciparum 3D7 strains were cultured at 5% hematocrit as described (20Trager W. Jensen J.M. Nature. 1978; 273: 621-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) using RPMI medium supplemented with 5% human serum or 0.5% Albumax (21Dorn A. Stoffel R. Matile H. Bubendorf A. Ridley R.G. Nature. 1995; 374: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Parasites were synchronized with 5% sorbitol (22Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar). For total parasite extracts infected erythrocytes from a 10-ml culture (5% hematocrit, 10% parasitemia) were lysed with 0.03% saponin for 20 min on ice, washed in PBS, and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Triton-X-114 phase separation was performed as previously described (23Spielmann T. Fergusen D.J. Beck H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1529-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 ml of parasite culture (15–20% parasitemia) was saponin-treated, and the pellet was washed with PBS and then resuspended in 500 μl of human tonicity phosphate-buffered saline (HTPBS: 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) containing 0.5% Triton-X-114 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and stored at –20 °C until use. After thawing, the extract was kept on ice for 30 min with intermittent mixing. The extract was spun at 15,000 × g for 20 min to pellet insoluble material. The supernatant, containing the detergent-soluble proteins, was layered over a 0.4-ml ice-cold sucrose cushion (6% sucrose, 0.06% Triton-X-114 in HTPBS), incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The resulting three phases were treated as follows. (i) The upper layer (detergent-depleted fraction) was collected; (ii) the sucrose cushion was discarded; (iii) the detergent pellet, containing the membrane proteins, was resuspended in 0.5 ml of HTPBS, the purification over a sucrose cushion was repeated, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of HTPBS. Both the detergent-depleted fraction (i) and the final detergent fraction (iii) were precipitated with tricarboxylic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Localization Studies Using Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy— Infected erythrocytes were smeared onto glass slides and fixed in acetone:methanol (1:1 v/v) at –20 °C for 10 min. Slides were partitioned into wells using a hydrophobic pen and incubated for 1 h in a humid chamber with one or both of the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-MAHRP-1c (1:1000), rabbit anti-PfEMP3 (1:50), rabbit anti PfEMP1 (1:200). The primary antibody was washed off with PBS or 1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, and the slides were then incubated with one or both secondary antibodies: fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:250) and Alexa 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:50). The slides were mounted in 90% glycerol containing 0.05% N-propyl gallate (Sigma) to reduce bleaching. Samples were viewed using an Olympus BX50 light microscope fitted with a fluorescence attachment and a SPOT RT digital camera or with a Leica TCS-NT laser-scanning confocal microscope at the Confocal Microscopy Facility, Monash University. FP Binding Studies—The interaction between FP and the recombinant proteins was examined spectrophotometrically in PBS, pH 7.4. Concentrated stock solutions of FP (10 mm) were freshly prepared in 0.1 m NaOH and diluted in water as required. Absorption spectra were recorded using a Cary 1E spectrophotometer. The absorption spectrum of FP exhibits a time-dependent change due to gradual self-association events (24Brown S.B. Hatzikonstantinou H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 585: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, spectroscopic measurements of FP in the presence of protein were recorded 2 min after mixing the FP stock into the protein solution. Redox Activity of FP—The H2O2-mediated decomposition of FP at pH 7.4 was monitored by measuring the decrease in absorbance of FP (5 μm) in the presence or absence of either MAHRP-1c, BSA. or GST (all 2 μm). The reaction (in a final volume of 950 μl) was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of H2O2 (final concentration 2 mm) and monitored at 20 °C using a Carry 1E spectrophotometer. The initial measured value for the FP concentration was set as 100%. To monitor the peroxidase-like activity of FP at pH 7.4, samples (200 μl) containing 5 mm OPD and 5μm FP with or without protein (MAHRP-1c, BSA, or GST; 0.1–2.0 μm) were added to the wells of a 96-well plate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 40 mm H2O2, and plates were incubated at 20 °C for 20 min. The oxidation of OPD was measured at 490 nm after the addition of 50 μl of 3 m HCl. Identification and Primary Structure of MAHRP-1—Using suppression subtractive hybridization, we identified a set of genes that are exclusively transcribed in the ring stage of P. falciparum 3D7 strain, as reported in Spielmann and Beck (19Spielmann T. Beck H.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Among the 13 ring stage-specific gene fragments obtained, one coded for a histidine-rich protein (AJ290925). Using the gene sequence to query the malaria sequence data base revealed that mahrp1 is located on chromosome 13. The deduced protein and the gene organization are presented in Fig. 1. The predicted intron sequence was removed from the complete gene to obtain the open reading frame. The translated sequence comprises 249 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 28.9 kDa and a pI of 5.92. MAHRP-1 contains a predicted transmembrane domain (amino acids 106–124) but no predicted N-terminal signal sequence. The region C terminus to the transmembrane domain has a histidine content of nearly 30% and contains 6 tandem repeats of the amino acid sequence, DHGH, with additional preceding DH repeats. We examined the degree of conservation of MAHRP-1 among different strains of P. falciparum. Digestion of six strains with restriction enzymes SspI and NcoI resulted in four distinguishable fragments (Fig. 2). The major length polymorphism was found in the 160-bp fragment in the histidine-rich region of the C-terminal domain, between amino acids 195 and 249. Sequence analysis revealed that alleles differed in the number of DHGH repeats, whereby 3D7 has 6 and ITG2F6 has13 repeats. Immunochemical Characterization of MAHRP-1 in Parasitized Erythrocytes—The C-terminal domain of MAHRP-1 (3D7 strain, amino acids 131–242), referred to as MAHRP-1c, was expressed as a 41-kDa GST fusion protein in E. coli (Fig. 3A), and the purified protein MAHRP-1c was used to raise antibodies in mice. The serum recognized the recombinant MAHRP-1c-GST fusion protein but not recombinant GST on a Western blot (Fig. 3B). The antiserum recognized a single band of the predicted size at ∼30 kDa in an extract of parasitized erythrocytes (Fig. 3C, lane a). The antiserum does not appear to cross-react with other proteins. In particular, it does not recognize bands corresponding to the ∼60-kDa protein recognized by an antiserum against HRP2; Fig. 3C (lane b) or the ∼90-kDa band obtained with serum against the KAHRP (Fig. 3C, lane c). In addition, the anti-MAHRP-1c serum gave no signal on protein preparations from uninfected erythrocytes (data not shown). Infected erythrocytes were treated with detergents to elucidate the physical organization of MAHRP-1. Most of the MAHRP-1 signal was associated with the saponin-insoluble pellet (Fig. 4A, lane a). Further partitioning of the pelleted fraction using the detergent Triton X-114 yielded three fractions, i.e. a detergent-soluble fraction, an aqueous (detergent-depleted) fraction, and an insoluble fraction. MAHRP-1 appeared to be largely associated with the detergent-soluble fraction, which is consistent with it being a membrane protein (Fig. 4B, lane c). Subcellular Location of MAHRP-1—We have used indirect immunofluorescence microscopy to examine the subcellular location of MAHRP-1 in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. MAHRP-1c antibodies reacted with punctuate structures within the cytoplasm of the host erythrocytes (Fig. 5A). The pattern obtained resembles the pattern obtained for Pf322 (17Hinterberg K. Scherf A. Gysin J. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Mazie J.C. da Silva L.P. Mattei D. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), PfSBP1 (18Blisnick T. Morales Betoulle M.E. Barale J.C. Uzureau P. Berry L. Desroses S. Fujioka H. Mattei D. Braun B.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and PfEMP3 (14Crabb B.S. Cooke B.M. Reeder J.C. Waller R.F. Caruana S.R. Davern K.M. Wickham M.E. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L. Cowman A.F. Cell. 1997; 89: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 16Waterkeyn J.G. Wickham M.E. Davern K.M. Cooke B.M. Coppel R.L. Reeder J.C. Culvenor J.G. Waller R.F. Cowman A.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2813-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which has been shown to be located in parasite-derived membranous structures in the erythrocyte cytosol, referred to as Maurer's clefts. MAHRP-1 was first observed in vesicle-like structures within the erythrocyte cytosol approximately ∼10 h post-invasion. As the parasite matured, the labeled structures increased in number. In the schizont stage, a diffuse staining of the entire erythrocyte appeared to underlie the punctuate foci. To confirm the Maurer's cleft location, we performed dual labeling studies using an antiserum against PfEMP3 (16Waterkeyn J.G. Wickham M.E. Davern K.M. Cooke B.M. Coppel R.L. Reeder J.C. Culvenor J.G. Waller R.F. Cowman A.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2813-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which has previously been described to be Maurer's cleft-located (Fig. 5B). A high degree of colocalization between PfEMP3 and MAHRP-1 was observed. Dual labeling with EXP-1, a parasite protein that is exported into the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane, indicated that MAHRP-1 is mainly located outside the parasite confines and within the confines of the erythrocyte membrane. We also used antisera against PfEMP1, a protein also transiently located in Maurer's clefts (15Wickham M.E. Rug M. Ralph S.A. Klonis N. McFadden G.I. Tilley L. Cowman A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5636-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5C, there is a tight colocalization of the erythrocyte cytosol population of PfEMP1 with MAHRP-1 in early trophozoite stages. In mature stages, PfEMP1 is partly redistributed to the erythrocyte membrane, whereas MAHRP-1 remains largely associated with the Maurer's clefts. MAHRP-1 Interacts with FP—Because of the high histidine content of MAHRP-1, we examined the ability of recombinant 3D7 MAHRP-1c to bind to an immobilized metal column. We found that MAHRP-1c-GST fusion protein bound strongly to a Ni2+-chelate column and was eluted with imidazole, thus providing potentially an additional step for purification of the protein (data not shown). Given the ability of MAHRP-1 to bind to metal ions and the proposed function of HRPs in FP detoxification, we examined the interaction between the protein and FP. Use was made of the visible absorption spectrum of FP to examine its interaction with protein. As shown in Fig. 6A, FP exhibits a characteristic absorption peak known as the Soret band with a maximum at 390 nm and a major shoulder at 350 nm and smaller (α and β) bands at wavelengths greater than 500 nm. Quantitative spectroscopic measurements of FP in aqueous solution are complicated by the presence of an equilibrium between the monomer and μ-oxo dimeric form of the FP, which is both pH- and concentration-dependent (24Brown S.B. Hatzikonstantinou H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 585: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Brown S.B. Dean T.C. Jones P. Biochem. J. 1970; 117: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The FP dimer is favored under basic conditions and at high concentrations. Under acidic conditions, the monomer is favored; however, FP also tends to aggregate and to form β-hematin crystals (6Egan T.J. Combrinck J.M. Egan J. Hearne G.R. Marques H.M. Ntenteni S. Sewell B.T. Smith P.J. Taylor D. van Schalkwyk D.A. Walden J.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The maximum wavelengths and extinction coefficients for the FP absorption bands are sensitive to the presence of bound liga"
https://openalex.org/W2026785150,"Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous parasitic protozoan, which causes congenital infectious diseases as well as severe encephalitis, a major cause of death among immune-deficient persons, such as AIDS patients. T. gondii is normally controlled by the immune system of healthy individuals, leading to an asymptomatic infection. T. gondii triggers early cytokine production, which, to a certain extent, protects the host against replication of tachyzoites, the infective form of the parasite. Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) constitute a class of glycolipids that have various functions, the most fundamental being to link proteins to eucaryotic cell membranes. GPIs are involved in the pathogenicity of other protozoan parasites and are known to induce tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) production. We show that GPIs highly purified from T. gondii tachyzoites, as well as their core glycans, induce TNFα production in macrophages. A chemically synthesized GPI of T. gondii lacking its lipid moiety, GPIa, has the same effect as the natural GPIs, whereas a chemically synthesized molecule with dialkylglycerol instead of diacylglycerol as lipid moiety, GPIb, does not induce TNFα production. Moreover, GPIb inhibits the TNFα production induced by T. gondii GPI or by GPIa. The core glycan prepared from the two chemically synthesized molecules activates macrophages, showing that the lipid moiety may regulate signaling. Stimulation of macrophages with GPIs of T. gondii results in activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, which is inhibited by the chemically synthesized GPIb, suggesting the involvement of NF-κB in TNFα gene expression. Our results support the idea that T. gondii GPIs are bioactive factors that participate in the production of TNFα during toxoplasmal pathogenesis. Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous parasitic protozoan, which causes congenital infectious diseases as well as severe encephalitis, a major cause of death among immune-deficient persons, such as AIDS patients. T. gondii is normally controlled by the immune system of healthy individuals, leading to an asymptomatic infection. T. gondii triggers early cytokine production, which, to a certain extent, protects the host against replication of tachyzoites, the infective form of the parasite. Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) constitute a class of glycolipids that have various functions, the most fundamental being to link proteins to eucaryotic cell membranes. GPIs are involved in the pathogenicity of other protozoan parasites and are known to induce tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) production. We show that GPIs highly purified from T. gondii tachyzoites, as well as their core glycans, induce TNFα production in macrophages. A chemically synthesized GPI of T. gondii lacking its lipid moiety, GPIa, has the same effect as the natural GPIs, whereas a chemically synthesized molecule with dialkylglycerol instead of diacylglycerol as lipid moiety, GPIb, does not induce TNFα production. Moreover, GPIb inhibits the TNFα production induced by T. gondii GPI or by GPIa. The core glycan prepared from the two chemically synthesized molecules activates macrophages, showing that the lipid moiety may regulate signaling. Stimulation of macrophages with GPIs of T. gondii results in activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, which is inhibited by the chemically synthesized GPIb, suggesting the involvement of NF-κB in TNFα gene expression. Our results support the idea that T. gondii GPIs are bioactive factors that participate in the production of TNFα during toxoplasmal pathogenesis. Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that invades nearly all nucleated cells in a complex multistep process (1Joiner K.A. Dubremetz J.F. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1169-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primo-infection of pregnant women may cause congenital toxoplasmosis with the risk of severe injury of the fetus (2Remington J.S. Desmonts G. Remington J.S. Klein J.O. Infectious Diseases of the Fetus and Newborn Infant. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1990: 89-195Google Scholar). The reactivation of previously dormant brain cysts containing the bradyzoite stage leads to Toxoplasma encephalitis, a major cause of death among immune-deficient persons (3Luft B.J. Remington J.S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 15: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Toxoplasmosis in general is a benign infection that causes mild or even no symptoms in immunocompetent individuals. A strong cell-mediated immunity induced by T. gondii protects the host against rapid parasite growth and consequent pathologies. This immunity is associated with the development of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes producing type 1 cytokines, in particular interferon γ (IFNγ) 1The abbreviations used are: IFNγ, interferon γ; GPIs, glycosylphosphatidylinositols; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TLRs, Toll-like receptors.1The abbreviations used are: IFNγ, interferon γ; GPIs, glycosylphosphatidylinositols; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TLRs, Toll-like receptors.

Expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) mRNAs was shown in the brain and the spleen of infected mice (5Hunter C.A. Roberts C.W. Alexander J. Eur. J.

These cytokines are involved in T cell-independent mechanisms against T. gondii infection. TNFα increases in vitro the number of cysts formed in human fibroblasts, involving the activity of an acidic sphingomyelinase (8Ricard J. Pelloux H. Pathak S. Pipy B. Ambroise-Thomas P. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). TNFα acts synergistically with IFNγ against cerebral toxoplasmosis by inducing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity, which degrades tryptophan, resulting in an antiparasitic mechanism in brain cells (9Daubener W.

Kim K.S. Schroten H. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6527-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Acute toxoplasmosis that causes rapid death in mice is accompanied by high levels of type 1 cytokines in the serum, including IFNγ and TNFα (11Mordue D.G. Monroy F. La Regina M. Dinarello C.A. Sibley L.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4574-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Although endogenous TNFα is important for resistance against T. gondii, daily treatment of infected mice with TNFα leads to earlier death than in control mice (12Hunter C.A. Suzuki Y. Subauste C.S. Remington J.S. Gross U. Toxoplasma gondii. Vol. 219. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 113-125Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). TNFα mRNA is not expressed in human astrocytoma cells after in vitro infection with different strains of T. gondii (13Pelloux H. Ricard J. Bracchi V. Markowicz Y. Verna J.M. Ambroise-Thomas P. Parasitol. Res. 1994; 80: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), whereas murine inflammatory macrophages are able to synthesize the transcript (14Grunvald E. Chiaramonte M. Hieny S. Wysocka M. Trinchieri G. Vogel S.N. Gazzinelli R.T. Sher A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2010-2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Infected human monocytes and macrophages do not secrete TNFα (15Pelloux H. Chumpitazi B.F. Santoro F. Polack B. Vuillez J.P. Ambroise-Thomas P. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2672-2676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the cytokine is produced by murine microglial cells and murine macrophages infected with T. gondii (16Fischer H.G. Nitzgen B. Reichmann G. Hadding U. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1539-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Fischer H.G. Dorfler R. Schade B. Hadding U. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Treatment of T. gondii-infected monocytes with IFNγ in combination with LPS reduces the invasion index of T. gondii due to the production of TNFα. However, a significant decrease in TNFα secretion is seen in response to IFNγ/LPS in T. gondii-infected monocytes, in comparison with uninfected cells (18Belloni A. Aubert D. Gomez Marin J.E. Le Naour R. Bonhomme A. Guenounou M. Pinon J.M. Parasitol. Res. 2000; 86: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, active invasion of the parasite is required to mediate the suppression of TNFα production in macrophages (19Butcher B.A. Denkers E.Y. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the case of stimulation with soluble antigen extract of T. gondii, both murine macrophages (14Grunvald E. Chiaramonte M.

Little is known about the mechanisms by which T. gondii induce the production of cytokines. An important reason for determining the molecules responsible for cytokine production relates to their potential use as immunomodulators. The parasite molecules in soluble tachyzoite antigen responsible for TNFα induction are heat stable, partially resistant to proteinase K treatment, and sensitive to periodate oxidation at high concentrations, suggesting that they are protein-associated glycoconjugates (14Grunvald E. Chiaramonte M. Hieny S. Wysocka M. Trinchieri G. Vogel S.N. Gazzinelli R.T. Sher A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2010-2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) constitute a class of glycolipids that have various functions, the most fundamental being to link proteins and glycoproteins via their C terminus to cell membrane. Different studies have documented the immunostimulatory and regulatory activities of protozoan GPIs. GPIs of Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei, Leishmania mexicana, and Trypanosoma cruzi are inducers of TNFα production in macrophages (23Schofield L. Hackett F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 24Tachado S.D. Schofield L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Free GPIs as well as GPI-anchored proteins are present in T. gondii (27Tomavo S. Schwarz R.T. Dubremetz J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4576-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We show that isolated T. gondii GPIs induce the production of TNFα in macrophages, involving the activation of NF-κB p65, a member of the NF-κB/c-rel family of transcription factors. Materials—[3H]Glucosamine hydrochloride (25 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Two GPI molecules of T. gondii were chemically synthesized according to Pekari et al. (28Pekari K. Tailler D. Weingart R. Schmidt R.R. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 7432-7442Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and have the following structure: GPIa, (ethanolamine-PO4)-Manα1–2Manα1–6(Glc-α1–4GalNAcβ1–4)Manα1–4GlcNα-inositol-PO4, and GPIb, (ethanolamine-PO4)-Manα1–2Manα1–6(Glcα1–4GalNAcβ1–4)Manα1–4GlcNα-inositol-PO4-dialkylglycerol. Dipalmitoylglycerol and distearylglycerol were purchased from Sigma. Parasites and Host Cells—RH strain T. gondii tachyzoites were grown in Vero cells. Confluent cell cultures (75 cm2) were infected with 5 × 107 tachyzoites in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cell line and parasites were routinely tested for Mycoplasma contamination. Metabolic Labeling of Tachyzoites—After infection with T. gondii tachyzoites (72 h post-infection), cell cultures were washed twice with glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm sodium pyruvate. Labeling was performed using the same medium supplemented with 0.5 mCi [3H]glucosamine for 4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. After labeling, parasites were released from host cells with 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Tachyzoites were purified by glass wool filtration as described previously (29Grimwood B.G. Hechemy K. Stevens R.W. Exp. Parasitol. 1979; 48: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Extraction and Purification of Glycolipids—Purified tachyzoites were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and extracted according to Menon et al. (30Menon A.K. Schwarz R.T. Mayor S. Cross G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9033-9042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled and unlabeled glycolipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol/water (CMW 10:10:3 by volume). CMW-extracted glycolipids were partitioned between water and water-saturated n-butyl alcohol. Glycolipids recovered in the butanol phase were analyzed by TLC on Merck Silica 60 TLC plates using solvent system: hexane/chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid (3:10:10: 2:1 by volume). Chromatograms were scanned for radioactivity using a Berthold LB 2842 linear analyzer, and areas corresponding to individual glycolipid peaks (I to VI) were scraped off, re-extracted with CMW (10:10:3), and recovered in the butanol phase after water-saturated n-butyl alcohol/water partition. Glycolipids extracted according to the same procedure from non-infected Vero cells were used as control. Generation of Neutral Core Glycans of Glycolipids—TLC-purified glycolipids or chemically synthesized GPIs were dephosphorylated, deaminated, and reduced as described (30Menon A.K. Schwarz R.T. Mayor S. Cross G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9033-9042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, dephosphorylation was performed by incubation of TLC-purified glycolipids with 48% aqueous HF for 60 h at 0 °C. The reaction was stopped by blowing off HF under a nitrogen stream. Glycolipids were resuspended in 400 μl of freshly prepared 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 3.5) containing 0.25 m NaNO2 and incubated at room temperature for 4 h. The reaction was terminated by addition of 300 μl of 0.4 m boric acid and 130 μl of 1 m NaOH. The material was reduced overnight at 4 °C using 2 m NaBH4 prepared in 0.3 m NaOH and desalted over AG50W-X12 resin. Core glycans were also prepared from the GPI anchor of P30, the major surface protein of T. gondii purified as described by Zinecker et al. (31Zinecker C.F. Striepen B. Geyer H. Geyer R. Dubremetz J.F. Schwarz R.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 116: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, P30 was isolated from tachyzoite lysates by immunoprecipitation using an affinity column (1E5 monoclonal antibody coupled to CNBr-Sepharose). Eluted P30 was digested with Pronase. Hydrophobic peptides isolated by water-saturated n-butyl alcohol/water partition were dephosphorylated, deaminated, and reduced as described above. Generation of Diacylglycerol and Dialkylglycerol of Glycolipids— TLC-purified GPI of T. gondii and the chemically synthesized GPIb were cleaved using 1 unit of phosphatidylinositol/phospholipase C derived from Bacillus cereus (Sigma) in 100 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% sodium deoxycholate overnight at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 10 μl of acetic acid, and the enzyme was inactivated by treatment for 3 min at 100 °C. Diacylglycerol and dialkylglycerol were recovered in the butanol phase after partition between water and water-saturated n-butyl alcohol. In Vitro Macrophage Activation and TNFα Sandwich ELISA—RAW 264.7 macrophages were diluted to a concentration of 106/ml with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, and 0.2-ml aliquots were dispensed into the wells of a 96-well plate. The cells were allowed to adhere for 3 h, washed, and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h with medium containing different concentrations of GPIs and core glycans purified from T. gondii, or synthesized GPIs. Butanol containing the GPIs and water containing the core glycans were dried under a nitrogen stream and resuspended in culture medium by sonication. For negative controls, macrophages were incubated in medium alone to determine background levels of TNFα production or in medium containing glycolipids purified from non-infected Vero cells. Measurement of TNFα levels in the macrophage culture supernatants was performed using specific sandwich ELISA (BD Biosciences). Samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight in 96-well plate coated with anti-mouse TNFα, followed by washing and probing with biotinylated anti-mouse TNFα, followed by avidin-peroxidase. After addition and development of substrate, the colorimetric reaction was evaluated using automated ELISA reader at 450 nm. Levels of TNFα were calculated from standard curves established for each assay by using mouse recombinant TNFα, and the data from triplicate determinations were expressed as pg/ml (mean ± S.D.). NF-κB p65 Transcription Factor Assay—Macrophages were stimulated for 30 min with or without T. gondii GPI. Total macrophage proteins (20 μg) were analyzed for NF-κB activation, using the Trans-AM™ NF-κB p65 transcription factor assay kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium). Statistics—The unpaired Student's t test was adopted for statistical evaluation, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. TNFα Production in Response to GPIs and Their Core Glycans Highly Purified from T. gondii—In order to determine whether the GPIs of T. gondii induce TNFα production, parasite glycolipids were isolated and purified by sequential extraction and phase partition and analyzed by TLC. Glycolipids from metabolically labeled parasites with [3H]glucosamine were used as tracers. The glycolipids have the following structures (32Striepen B. Zinecker C.F. Damm J.B. Melgers P.A. Gerwig G.J. Koolen M. Vliegenthart J.F. Dubremetz J.F. Schwarz R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 797-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar): GPIs I and II, (ethanolamine-PO4)-Manα1–2Manα1–6(Glcα1–4GalNAcβ1–4)Manα1–4GlcNα-inositol-PO4-lipid; GPI III, (ethanolamine-PO4)-Manα1–2Manα1–6(GalNAcβ1–4)Manα1–4GlcNα-inositol-PO4-lipid; GPIs IV and V, Manα1–2Manα1–6(Glcα1–4GalNAcβ1–4)Manα1–4GlcNα-inositol-PO4-lipid; and GPI VI, Manα1–2Manα1–6(GalNAcβ1–4)Manα1–4GlcNα-inositol-PO4-lipid. GPIs I and II and GPIs IV and V differ in their fatty acid composition with palmitic and stearic acids as predominant lipids (Fig. 1, A and B). Areas corresponding to the six peaks were scraped and glycolipids re-extracted from silica using organic solvent as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Macrophages were incubated with individual GPIs, and TNFα secretion in supernatants was measured using a sandwich ELISA. All of six T. gondii GPIs induced significantly the production of TNFα by macrophages (Fig. 2A). The stimulation was effective with glycolipids extracted from 106 parasites (p < 0.01) and increased in a dose-dependent manner. The individual separation of the GPIs by TLC is required to observe the production of TNFα. Indeed, total glycolipids extracted from 108 T. gondii tachyzoites with CMW, as well as hydrophobic glycolipids, recovered after a butanol/water partition, did not induce the secretion of TNFα by macrophages (Fig. 2A). In order to confirm that glycolipids of T. gondii are responsible for this effect, non-infected Vero cells were tested as control. Glycolipids were extracted from 107 Vero cells using CMW and butanol/water partition and separated on TLC. Areas corresponding to the GPIs of T. gondii were scraped and glycolipids re-extracted from silica. The different samples failed to induce the production of TNFα by macrophages (Fig. 2B), confirming that this production is specific for the individually separated GPIs from T. gondii. In order to know if the glycan moiety induces TNFα production, core glycans from individual T. gondii GPIs were prepared by dephosphorylation, nitrous deamination, and reduction. Two core glycans were generated from the six glycolipids; the core glycan A, having the structure Manα1–2Manα1–6(GalNAcβ1–4)Manα1–4-anhydromannitol, and the core glycan B, having the structure Manα1–2Manα1–6(Glcα1–4GalNAcβ1–4)Manα1–4-anhydromannitol. Core glycans were tested for their ability to stimulate macrophages and showed to significantly induce the production of TNFα at a concentration of 100 nm (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2C). Lower concentration (10 nm) had no significant effect in comparison with the control culture. To rule out the possibility that another molecule (impurity) was responsible for TNFα production, a second method was used to obtain highly purified core glycan from T. gondii GPIs. Immunoprecipitation of p30, the major surface GPI-anchored protein of T. gondii, permitted isolation of a pure GPI-anchored protein free of other glycolipids. Purified p30 was digested with Pronase, and hydrophobic anchor peptide was treated to release the neutral core glycan fragment. This highly purified molecule was tested and showed to stimulate TNFα production in macrophages (Fig. 2C). This confirmed that GPIs extracted from T. gondii are able to induce TNFα production in macrophages and that the neutral core glycans are sufficient for this effect.Fig. 2GPIs and their core glycans highly purified from T. gondii tachyzoites induce TNFα production in macrophages. A, macrophages were incubated for 24 h in the presence of glycolipids extracted with CMW (10:10:3) from 108 T. gondii tachyzoites, or in the presence of glycolipids recovered in butanol, or in the presence of GPIs separated by TLC (I–VI) extracted from 106 to 109 T. gondii tachyzoites. B, macrophages were cultured for 24 h in presence of glycolipids extracted from 107 Vero cells and corresponding to the GPIs of T. gondii on the TLC. C, macrophages were incubated for 24 h with 10 nm and 100 nm of core glycans prepared from the GPIs (I–VI) or from the major surface protein p30 of T. gondii. Supernatants were assayed for TNFα production using a sandwich ELISA. Values represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TNFα Production in Response to Chemically Synthesized GPIs without Lipid Moiety and with Dialkylglycerol as Lipid Moiety—To understand the role of the GPI lipid moiety in activation of macrophages, a T. gondii GPI anchor chemically synthesized without the lipid moiety, GPIa (Manα1–2Manα1–6(GalNAcβ1–4)Manα1–4GlcNα-inositol-PO4, Fig. 3A), was tested. In the presence of GPIa, macrophages secreted TNFα in the supernatant (Fig. 3B). As for core glycans generated from GPIs of T. gondii, the core glycan of the synthetic GPIa induced TNFα production (Fig. 3C). The core glycan of GPIa has the same structure as that of the core glycan of GPI III, and the production of TNFα induced by both core glycans is comparable. Only 10 nm of the GPIa core glycan was sufficient to stimulate significantly the macrophages, whereas 1 μm (100-fold more) of the entire molecule was required for the same effect, suggesting that the phosphate group of GPIa diminishes efficiency of the core glycan. The role of the lipid moiety in TNFα stimulation was further investigated using a second synthetic molecule. GPIb has the same sugar structure as the molecule described above, but it contains dialkylglycerol as lipid moiety (Fig. 4A). No difference in TNFα level was observed between control and cells stimulated with the synthetic GPIb, even at 100 μm (Fig. 4B). Preparation of the core glycan from GPIb resulted in an active molecule that stimulated TNFα production in macrophages (Fig. 4C). In order to determine whether GPIb could inhibit the production of TNFα, the molecule was tested in addition to a natural GPI extracted from T. gondii or with the synthetic GPIa. The GPIb molecule reduced significantly TNFα production induced by high levels of both natural and synthetic GPIs (Fig. 4D). This indicates that the presence of dialkylglycerol as lipid moiety leads to a molecule unable to stimulate TNFα production, which inhibits the active GPIs. T. gondii GPI and the chemically synthesized GPIb were treated with phosphatidylinositol/phospholipase C, and the corresponding lipid moieties were recovered in the butanol phase. This treatment leads to complete release of the lipid moiety (33Striepen B. Tomavo S. Dubremetz J.F. Schwarz R.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 296Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The GPI diacylglycerol alone was able to induce TNFα production but to a lesser extent than the entire molecule (Fig. 4E). A dipalmitoylglycerol standard tested as a control did not have any effect, whereas a distearylglycerol standard leads to secretion of TNFα. The released dialkylglycerol, as the intact GPIb, did not induce TNFα production and inhibited the stimulatory effect of the GPI diacylglycerol (Fig. 4E).Fig. 4A chemically synthesized GPI with dialkylglycerol as lipid moiety does not induce TNFα production in macrophages, whereas its core glycan does. A, structure of GPIb, a chemically synthesized GPI anchor of T. gondii with dialkylglycerol as lipid moiety. B, macrophages were cultured for 24 h with 1–100 μm of GPIb. C, macrophages were incubated for 24 h in the presence of 10 and 100 nm of GPIb core glycan. D, macrophages were cultured in presence of a natural GPI extracted from 108 T. gondii tachyzoites (G), or in the presence of 100 μm of GPIa (a), with or without 10 μm GPIb (b). E, macrophages were incubated for 24 h with dialkylglycerol (GPIb) or diacylglycerol (T. gondii GPI), or both together, or with dipalmitoylglycerol (diC16) and distearylglycerol (diC18) as standards. Supernatants were assayed for TNFα production using a sandwich ELISA.

To determine whether the production of TNFα in response to the GPI molecules of T. gondii is regulated by NF-κB, macrophages were incubated 15, 30, and 60 min with or without T. gondii GPI. The proteins of macrophages were extracted and tested in an NF-κB assay. After 15 min of incubation, the GPI did not increase NF-κB activation in macrophages in comparison with the control (Fig. 5). After 30 and 60 min, NF-κB activation increased in the presence of T. gondii GPI. Incubation with the synthetic GPIb reduced NF-κB activation induced after 30 min by the natural GPI of T. gondii. This suggests that the TNFα production by macrophages in response to T. gondii GPIs requires NF-κB activation. T. gondii-induced host cell activation is supposed to play a role in the initiation of immune resistance and may regulate intracellular replication of the parasite. Expression and secretion of cytokines triggered by living Toxoplasma or parasite lysate are involved in acute reaction of the T cell-independent immunity (34Sher A. Oswald I.P. Hieny S.

The authors hypothesize that the relevant structures are protein-anchored glycolipids similar to the phosphatidylinositol-containing molecules in the malaria parasites responsible for the stimulation of TNFα (14Grunvald E.

Indeed, GPI of P. falciparum, free or associated with protein, induced TNFα and IL-1 secretion by macrophages (23Schofield L. Hackett F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Similarly, highly purified GPI anchors isolated from trypomastigotes of T. cruzi triggered the synthesis of TNFα by mouse macrophages (26Almeida I.C. Camargo M.M. Procopio D.O. Silva L.S. Mehlert A. Travassos L.R. Gazzinelli R.T. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Here we show that the GPIs highly purified from T. gondii stimulate macrophages to produce TNFα. Only individually separated GPIs of T. gondii present an activity. Indeed, glycolipids extracted with chloroform/methanol/water or hydrophobic glycolipids recovered in butanol after a butanol/water partition do not induce TNFα production, suggesting the presence of other glycolipids than GPIs that could have an inhibitory effect. Thus, the structure and the role in vivo of inhibitory molecules remain to be elucidated. The malarial GPI core glycan Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcN-myo-inositol is necessary and sufficient to induce TNFα production, whereas the inositol glycan or the lyso-GPI is not sufficient for TNFα induction, indicating that the GPI-associated diacylglycerol is required for maximal downstream gene expression (25Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Our results show that the two neutral core glycans prepared from free or protein-associated GPIs of T. gondii induce TNFα secretion. Furthermore, the lipid moiety alone is able to stimulate the macrophages. A GPI anchor of T. gondii synthesized with a phosphate group instead of fatty acids is able to induce TNFα secretion but to a lesser extent than the core glycans. On the contrary, a GPI anchor synthesized with a dialkylglycerol as the lipid moiety does not stimulate the production of TNFα in macrophages. Furthermore, this molecule inhibits the secretion of TNFα in response to both natural and synthetic GPIs of T. gondii. Interestingly, the dialkylglycerol moiety alone is sufficient to induce an inhibitory effect. The structurally related molecule iM4 glycoinositol phospholipid from L. mexicana is unable to induce TNFα and inhibits the TNFα production in response to LPS stimulation, suggesting that alkylacylglycerols may antagonize macrophage activation (25Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, the results suggest that only GPIs with acylglycerols as the lipid moieties are able to induce TNFα synthesis in macrophages. It would be interesting to study if a chemically synthesized GPI of T. gondii with an alkylacylglycerol as the lipid moiety also may inhibit TNFα production. The inhibitory activity of GPIb could be exploited at first in an animal model to treat acute toxoplasmosis, where high levels of TNFα are produced. The inositol glycan moiety of the malarial GPI is the minimal structural requirement for activation of protein-tyrosine kinases in macrophages. However, to induce maximal gene expression, a non-protein-tyrosine kinase signal is required and is provided by the diacylglycerols, which activate the calcium independent ϵ isoform of the protein kinase C (25Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the case of T. cruzi, GPIs activate the extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK1/ERK2), the c-Jun kinases, and the stress-activated protein kinase (p38). The activation of these signaling pathways results in changes in gene expression, mediated by transcription factors (CREB and NF-κB), leading to IL-12 and TNFα synthesis (36Ropert C. Ferreira L.R. Campos M.A. Procopio D.O. Travassos L.R. Ferguson M.A. Reis L.F. Teixeira M.M. Almeida I.C. Gazzinelli R.T. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Infection of macrophages with T. gondii induces rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 and p38 (19Butcher B.A. Denkers E.Y. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Experiments performed with protein kinase inhibitors suggest that the synthesis of TNFα, induced by soluble antigen of T. gondii, is protein kinase C-dependent, whereas the kinase does not appear to play a dominant role in soluble antigen-induced IL-12 and IL-10 responses, arguing that distinct parasite signals are involved in monokine induction (14Grunvald E. Chiaramonte M. Hieny S. Wysocka M. Trinchieri G. Vogel S.N. Gazzinelli R.T. Sher A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2010-2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo infection of mice with virulent or avirulent strains of T. gondii leads to activation of NF-κB in peritoneal cells (37Shapira S. Speirs K. Gerstein A. Caamano J. Hunter C.A. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 185: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, Butcher and Denkers (19Butcher B.A. Denkers E.Y. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have no evidence for NF-κB p65 translocation in peritoneal cells of mice infected in vivo with a virulent strain of T. gondii. Despite rapid IκBα degradation, the parasite fails to induce NF-κB nuclear translocation as well as induction of IL-12 and TNFα in macrophages (19Butcher B.A. Denkers E.Y. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In vitro infection with tachyzoites of avirulent strains stimulates the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus. This translocation is reduced in cells exposed to virulent strains (38Dobbin C.A. Smith N.C. Johnson A.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Soluble tachyzoite antigen prepared from T. gondii induces NF-κB DNA binding activity in macrophages (20Gazzinelli R.T. Wysocka M. Hieny S. Scharton-Kersten T. Cheever A. Kuhn R. Muller W. Trinchieri G. Sher A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 798-805PubMed Google Scholar). We reported that T. gondii GPI activates NF-κB p65 in macrophages after 30 min of stimulation. The inhibition of TNFα production in the presence of GPI with dialkylglycerol as lipid moiety correlates with a reduction of NF-κB activation, suggesting that GPI-induced TNFα expression is under the regulatory control of the NF-κB p65. A remaining issue concerns the mechanisms by which the GPIs enter the signaling pathway. A possibility is that GPIs are hydrolyzed at the cell surface by GPI-specific phospholipase. Alternatively, the passive incorporation of intact GPI-anchored proteins is a well known phenomenon, as well as mono-molecular, micellar, and micro-vesicular transport (39Medof M.E. Nagarajan S. Tykocinski M.L. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 574-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Despite the growing evidence implicating GPIs from parasitic protozoa in the induction of cytokine synthesis by macrophages, not much is known about the receptors that are triggered by these GPIs. Tachado et al. (25Tachado S.D. Gerold P. Schwarz R. Novakovic S. McConville M. Schofield L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) suggest expression of a glycan-specific receptor responsible for activation of protein-tyrosine kinases and the translocation of the phosphatidylinositol moiety of the malarial GPI to the cytoplasm to act as a second messenger. Magez et al. (40Magez S. Stijlemans B. Radwanska M. Pays E. Ferguson M.A. De Baetselier P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1949-1956PubMed Google Scholar) evoke the involvement of two distinct receptors for the glycan and lipid components of T. brucei GPIs. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediate recognition of a wide range of microbial products including lipopolysaccharides, lipoproteins, flagellin, and bacterial DNA, and signaling through TLRs leads to the production of inflammatory mediators (41Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752PubMed Google Scholar, 42Lien E. Sellati T.J. Yoshimura A. Flo T.H. Rawadi G. Finberg R.W.

Results obtained by Campos et al. (43Campos M.A. Almeida I.C. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Valente E.P. Procopio D.O. Travassos L.R. Smith J.A. Golenbock D.T. Gazzinelli R.T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) suggest that although functionally similar, the receptors used by LPS and GPI-mucin of T. brucei are not the same. Indeed, involvement of TLR-2, but not TLR-4, is essential in the induction of IL-12, TNFα, and NO by murine macrophages activated by T. cruzi GPI (43Campos M.A. Almeida I.C. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Valente E.P. Procopio D.O. Travassos L.R. Smith J.A. Golenbock D.T. Gazzinelli R.T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In human monocytes, both CD14 and TLR-2 are important molecules in the signaling transduction induced by the GPI-mucin of T. cruzi (36Ropert C. Ferreira L.R. Campos M.A. Procopio D.O. Travassos L.R. Ferguson M.A. Reis L.F. Teixeira M.M. Almeida I.C. Gazzinelli R.T. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). B cell proliferation in response to T. gondii heat shock protein HSP70 requires expression of TLR-4 (44Aosai F. Chen M. Kang H.K. Mun H.S. Norose K. Piao L.X. Kobayashi M. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Yano A. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2002; 7: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the induction of IL-12 by T. gondii soluble antigens is abolished in peritoneal macrophages lacking MyD88, the adaptor molecule used by TLR family members (45Scanga C.A. Aliberti J. Jankovic D. Tilloy F. Bennouna S. Denkers E.Y. Medzhitov R. Sher A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5997-6001Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). These new findings suggest that a receptor of the Toll-like receptor family could be responsible for signaling in macrophages in response to T. gondii GPIs. In this case, the inhibitory effect of GPI with dialkylglycerol as lipid moiety could be due to a competition for this receptor."

In tumorigenesis and tissue regeneration, HAI-1 regulates the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met pathway by inhibiting the activity of HGF activator (HGFA) and matriptase, two serine proteases that convert pro-HGF into its biologically active form. By screening a placental cDNA library, we discovered a new splice variant of HAI-1 designated HAI-1B that contains an extra 16 amino acids adjacent to the C terminus of KD1. To investigate possible consequences on Kunitz domain function, a soluble form of HAI-1B (sHAI-1B) comprising the entire extracellular domain was produced. First, we found that sHAI-1B displayed remarkable enzyme specificity by potently inhibiting only HGFA (IC50 = 30.5 nm), matriptase (IC50 = 16.5 nm), and trypsin (IC50 = 2.4 nm) among 16 serine proteases examined, including plasminogen activators (urokinase- and tissue-type plasminogen activators), coagulation enzymes thrombin, factors VIIa, Xa, XIa, and XIIa, and activated protein C. Relatively weak inhibition was found for plasmin (IC50 = 399 nm) and plasma kallikrein (IC50 = 686 nm). Second, the functions of the KD1 and KD2 domains in sHAI-1B were investigated using P1 residue-directed mutagenesis to show that inhibition of HGFA, matriptase, trypsin, and plasmin was due to KD1 and not KD2. Furthermore, analysis by reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that HAI-1B and HAI-1 were co-expressed in normal tissues and various epithelial-derived cancer cell lines. Both isoforms were up-regulated in eight examined ovarian carcinoma specimens, three of which had higher levels of HAI-1B RNA than of HAI-1 RNA. Therefore, previously demonstrated roles of HAI-1 in various physiological and pathological processes likely involve both HAI-1B and HAI-1.

When activated HGF binds to its receptor c-Met, it promotes phospho-transfer activity of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain leading to activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways. Therefore, as an inhibitor of HGFA and matriptase, HAI-1 may control the local generation of HGF and thus modulate the activity of the HGF/c-Met receptor system, which is involved in such biological processes as tissue regeneration, morphogenesis, and tumorigenesis (reviewed in Refs. 15Trusolino L.

Lin C.-Y. Singh B. Stewart M. Williams A. al-Nafussi A. Smyth J.F. Gabra H. Sellar G.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 1101-1107PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated levels of matriptase mRNA have also been observed in a wide variety of transformed cell lines (34Bhatt A.S. Takeuchi T. Yistra B. Ginzinger D. Albertson D. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Additional studies using tissue microarrays have also implicated matriptase and HAI-1 in the progression of node-negative breast cancer (35Kang J.Y. Dolled-Filhart M. Ocal I.T. Singh B. Lin C.-Y. Dickson R.B. Rimm D.L. Camp R.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1101-1105PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, HAI-1 may regulate the local generation of active HGF by HGFA or matriptase. In addition, HAI-1 may have a role in regulating matriptase-specific activities that could contribute to tumorigenicity and inflammation, such as the activation of u-PA and of G protein-coupled protease activated receptor-2 (9Lee S.-L.

Enzyme inhibition by HAI-1 is mediated by two Kunitz domains (N-terminal KD1 and C-terminal KD2) located in the extracellular domain. Both KD1 and KD2 can engage in protease inhibition (37Denda K.

Three splice variants were reported for HAI-2, designated as HAI-2A, HAI-2B, and HAI-2C (42Itoh H. Yamauchi M. Kataoka H. Hamasuna R. Kitamura N. Koono M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3351-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). They differ in RNA expression levels, tissue distribution, and the number of Kunitz domains (one or two). In the present study we describe a splice variant of HAI-1, designated HAI-1B, which contains two Kunitz domains. The generation of soluble HAI-1B allowed us to study enzyme specificity as well as the contribution of each Kunitz domain to enzyme inhibition. Moreover, the expression of HAI-1B relative to HAI-1 in tissues and cells has been investigated, and the implications on our current understanding of the biology of HAI-1 and HAI-1B are discussed. Reagents—Pro-HGF, expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in the absence of serum and purified by HiTrap Sepharose SP chromatography, was obtained from David Kahn (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The following synthetic substrates were used to measure enzyme activities: Cholinesterase PTC (propionylthiocholine and DTNB) (Sigma) for acetylcholinesterase, Spectrozyme® fVIIa (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) for HGFA, Chromozym-tPA (Roche Applied Science) for tissue factor/factor VIIa. The following substrates were from Diapharma (Westchester, OH): S2765 for matriptase, S2222 for factor Xa, S2302 for plasma kallikrein, S2366 for activated protein C and plasmin, S2444 for urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), S2288 for factor XIa, factor XIIa and tissue-type plasminogen activator, S2314 for complement factor C1s, and S2586 for chymotrypsin. Except for bovine trypsin (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ), all of the enzymes used were of human origin. Factor Xa, factor XIa, thrombin, activated protein C, and plasmin were from Haematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). Plasma kallikrein and factor XIIa were from American Diagnostica. u-PA, acetylcholinesterase, and chymotrypsin were from Sigma. Complement factor C1s was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Tissue-type plasminogen activator was from Genentech, Inc. Soluble human tissue factor (residues 1–219) was produced in Escherichia coli as described (43Kirchhofer D. Eigenbrot C. Lipari M.T. Moran P. Peek M. Kelley R.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Human recombinant factor VIIa was produced in 293 cells as described (44Dennis M.S.

All other reagents were of the highest quality available. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of HGFA—The active enzyme form of HGFA comprises the entire B-chain (Ile408–Ser655) disulfide-linked to the C-terminal 35 residues of the A-chain (Val373–Arg407) (4Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Kitamura A. Kondo J. Morimoto Y. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10024-10028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to produce recombinant active HGFA, the nucleotide sequence encoding amino acids 373–655 was cloned by PCR from an HGFA full-length clone into the baculovirus expression vector pAcGP67A (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) immediately 3′ to the gp67 secretion signal sequence. A nucleotide sequence encoding a three-residue Ala linker and a C-terminal poly-His tag (Ala3-His8) was added to the 3′-end. Isolated plasmid DNA was transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells on plates in ESF921 medium (Expression Systems, Woodland, CA) via the Baculogold Expression System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The virus was amplified three times before use in protein production. One liter of High Five™ cells (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) growing at 5 × 105 cells/ml in suspension in ESF921 medium was infected with 8 ml of viral stock. The cultures were incubated at 27 °C for 72 h before harvesting the culture medium by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 15 min. NiCl2, CaCl2, and Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, were added to give final concentrations of 1, 5, and 50 mm, respectively. Precipitate was removed by filtration through a 0.2-μm filter, and the medium was then applied onto a 2-ml Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen). After washing with 10 column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, the HGFA protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole. The purity of HGFA protein (∼32 kDa) was greater than 95% by SDS-PAGE analysis. N-terminal sequencing of the protein bands indicated that activation cleavage at the Arg407–Ile408 bond occurred spontaneously during the expression/purification procedures, resulting in enzymatically active two-chain HGFA. The protein concentration was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Matriptase—A full-length clone of matriptase was obtained by standard PCR protocols from a mixture of human cDNA libraries including those from brain, heart, liver, lung, and spleen using 5′ primer GGACCATGGGGAGCGATCG and 3′ primer CCTATACCCCAGTGTTCTCTTTGATCCAGT. A fragment containing the gene was excised from a 1% agarose gel, purified, and ligated into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequencing confirmed an open reading frame of 855 residues identical to that previously described (5Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence encoding amino acids 615–855 encoding the mature protease domain was cloned by PCR from the full-length clone ultimately into plasmid pSTII.TIR3 variant 4 (45Simmons L.C. Yansura D.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) such that Val615 immediately followed the stII signal sequence, and a His8 tag was on the C terminus. This plasmid contained a phoA promoter, the stII signal sequence, and the λto transcriptional terminator. Site-directed mutagenesis was also carried out to make the C731S mutant to avoid potential complications of an unpaired Cys in the protease domain using the oligonucleotide 5′-CGGCCCATCTCCCTGCCGGAC with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). As used in this paper, matriptase refers to the matriptase protease domain starting with Val615 containing C731S and a C-terminal His8 tail. E. coli strain 33D3 (W3110 ΔfhuA (ΔtonA) ptr3 lac Iq lacL8 ΔompT Δ(nmpc-fepE) degP41 kan R) was transformed with pSTII.MTSP.PD.H8. Single colonies from a LB carbenicillin plate were inoculated into 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) and grown at 30 °C on a culture wheel overnight. The 5-ml culture was diluted into 500 ml of phosphate-limiting medium (46Simmons L.C. Reilly D. Klimowski L. Raju T.S. Meng G. Sims P. Hong K. Shields R.L. Damico L.A. Rancatore P. Yansura D.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 263: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Carbenicillin was then added to the induction culture to give a concentration of 50 μg/ml, and the culture was grown for ∼24 h at 30 °C. E. coli pastes from 500-ml shake flask cultures (6–10-g pellets) were resuspended in 10 volumes (w/v) of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 7 m guanidine HCl. Solid sodium sulfite and sodium tetrathionate were added to make final concentrations of 0.1 and 0.02 m, respectively, and the solution was stirred overnight at 4 °C. The solution was clarified by centrifugation and loaded onto a 20-ml Qiagen Ni-NTA metal chelate column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, containing 6 m guanidine HCl. The column was washed with additional buffer containing 50 mm imidazole (Ultrol grade; Calbiochem). The protein was eluted with buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the desired protein based on SDS-PAGE were pooled and diluted to 50 μg/ml with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.6, 0.8 m arginine, 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm cysteine. The refolding mixture was incubated overnight at 2–8 °C. The protein was subsequently concentrated 20-fold using Vivascience (Edgewood, NY) concentrator (molecular weight cut-off, 10,000) and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.15 m NaCl. The refolded protein was loaded on a Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (>95% purity) and enzymatic activity using a chromogenic substrate (see below) and pooled. The matriptase protease domain was also analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and electrospray mass spectrometry. Protein concentration was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Human cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) or BioWhittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD) and were cultured in recommended serum-supplemented medium. The human normal cell lines used were mammary epithelial cells, aortic smooth muscle cells, pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, and umbilical artery endothelial cells. The human tumor cell lines used were: colorectal carcinoma cell lines (Colo205, HT29, HCT 116, SW480, and DLD-1), the breast carcinoma cell line BT-474, the lung carcinoma cell lines A549 and Calu-6, the pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines HPAC and HPAF-11, the bladder carcinoma cell line J82, the renal cell carcinoma cell line 786-0, the osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2, the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line A-673, and the prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3. For RNA isolation confluent cell layers were washed with PBS and Tri-Reagent-LS (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) was added to the cells, and total RNA was extracted according to manufacturer's protocols. Total RNA from various human tissues was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The RNA samples of normal ovary and ovarian adenocarcinomas were from Clontech (see Fig. 3c, samples 1 and 5), Ambion (Austin, TX; see Fig. 3c, samples 2 and 3), the University of Michigan (see Fig. 3c, samples 4 and 12), and the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (see Fig. 3c, samples 6–11). Normal and pathological specimens were removed from patients for therapeutic procedures unrelated to this study; they were provided following appropriate Institutional Review Board review. These total RNA samples were processed by use of oligo(dT)24 and SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) to obtain cDNA. The cDNAs were subjected to PCR using the primer set for HAI-1B and HAI-1 or the primer set for β-actin (control). The sequences of the primers were as follows: HAI-1B and HAI-1 forward, 5′-ATGGAGGCTGCTTGGGCAACA-3′; HAI-1B and HAI-1 reverse, 5′-ACAGGCAGCCTCGTCGGAGG-3′; β-actin forward, 5′-TCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTACGA-3′; and β-actin reverse: 5′-CAGCGGAACCGCTCATTGCCAATGG-3′. The PCR amplifications were carried out for 25 cycles of 45 s at 95 °C followed by 45 s at 55 °C and 1 min at 72 °C using Advantage-GC cDNA polymerase mix (Clontech). The PCR products were separated on a 2.5% agarose gel and then visualized by ethidium bromide staining. In some experiments the bands were excised from the gel, and the PCR products were extracted and sequenced. The obtained sequences were in full agreement with the expected sequences specific for HAI-1B (containing the 48-bp insert region) and for HAI-1 (1Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T.

Cloning of HAI-1B—Full-length HAI-1B was obtained from a cDNA library derived from human placental RNA using oligo(dT)/NotI site as a primer and adaptor with SalI site for the second strand. The cDNA was digested with SalI and NotI; cDNAs greater than 2.8 kb were ligated to pRK5D. Single-stranded DNA of the human placental cDNA/pRK5D library was generated using standard molecular biology methods. Reverse primer (5′-ACTGGATGGCGCCTTTCCATG-3′) was annealed to the single-stranded cDNA pool and extended using T7 or T4 DNA polymerase. E. coli were transformed with the synthesized double-stranded DNA, and colonies were screened using standard filter hybridization methods. The insert size was analyzed by PCR, and the HAI-1B full-length clones were identified and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Construction, Expression, and Purification of Soluble HAI-1B—A soluble form of HAI-1B (sHAI-1B) was produced by fusing the cDNA coding for the extracellular domain (amino acids Met1–Glu465) of HAI-1B via a Met-Gly residue linker to a poly-His tag at the C terminus (Met-Gly-His8). The cDNA was then inserted into eukaryotic expression vector pSVI7.ID.LL (47Lucas B.K. Giere L.M. DeMarco R.A. Shen A. Chisholm V. Crowley C.W.

To define the effects of phosphorylation of this residue in desensitization and internalization processes in mammalian expression systems, wild-type KOR-green fluorescent protein (KOR-GFP) and KOR(S369A)-GFP were stably expressed in AtT-20 and HEK293 cells. Using whole-cell patch clamp recording in transfected AtT-20 cells, agonist activation of either κ receptor form produced equivalent activation of the intrinsic G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel. Incubation for 60 min with the κ agonist U50,488 (100 nm) desensitized the response in cells expressing wild-type KOR-GFP by 86% but had no effect on KOR(S369A)-GFP-expressing cells. Phosphorylation of serine 369 was detected using a phosphospecific antibody (KOR-P) able to distinguish the phosphorylated form of the receptor. The agonist-induced increase in KOR-P labeling was dose-dependent, blocked by co-treatment with the κ antagonist norbinaltorphimine, and prevented by co-expression of the dominant negative form of the G-protein receptor kinase, GRK2(K220R). In contrast, agonist-induced increase in KOR-P labeling was not evident in KOR(S369A) expressing cells. Prolonged activation resulted in receptor internalization that was also blocked by KOR(S369A) substitution, but interestingly, KOR-P labeling was evident at lower agonist concentrations than required to induce internalization. Following the removal of agonist, receptor dephosphorylation detected by loss of KOR-P labeling was complete within 60 min, could be blocked by okadaic acid, and was not blocked by sucrose inhibition of receptor internalization. These results demonstrate that GRK-mediated phosphorylation of serine 369 mediates rat KOR desensitization and internalization.

The use of opioid agonists to produce clinical analgesia is limited by their propensity to induce drug tolerance and dependence (1Gutstein H.B. Akil H. Goodman Gilman A. Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 10th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York2001: 569-619Google Scholar). Therefore, regulatory mechanisms responsible for opioid tolerance are of therapeutic interest. Opioid receptor desensitization and internalization are likely to play significant roles in the control of receptor signaling, but the biochemical steps underlying these mechanisms are uncertain. Agonistinduced receptor phosphorylation is thought to mediate both G-protein coupled receptor desensitization and internalization (for a recent review, see Ref. 2Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, establishing a direct link between these receptor mechanisms and the phosphorylation of individual amino acid residues on the opioid receptors has been confounded by the large number of potential phosphorylation sites and the practical difficulty of identifying specific phosphorylated sites within the opioid receptors. Direct evidence of κ-opioid receptor (KOR) 1The abbreviations used are: KOR, κ-opioid receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; KOR-P, affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody directed to phosphoserine 369 in the rodent κ-opioid receptor; KT-2, affinity-purified rabbit anti-rat/mouse κ-opioid receptor polyclonal antibody; KE-4, affinity-purified rabbit anti-rat/mouse κ-opioid receptor polyclonal antibody; MOR, μ-opioid receptor; GRK, G-protein receptor kinase; nor-BNI, norbinaltorphimine; U50,488, (±)-trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide methane sulfonate hydrate.1The abbreviations used are: KOR, κ-opioid receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; KOR-P, affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody directed to phosphoserine 369 in the rodent κ-opioid receptor; KT-2, affinity-purified rabbit anti-rat/mouse κ-opioid receptor polyclonal antibody; KE-4, affinity-purified rabbit anti-rat/mouse κ-opioid receptor polyclonal antibody; MOR, μ-opioid receptor; GRK, G-protein receptor kinase; nor-BNI, norbinaltorphimine; U50,488, (±)-trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide methane sulfonate hydrate. phosphorylation was obtained by immunoprecipitation of 32P-labeled KOR from guinea pig hippocampal slices treated with a KOR-selective agonist (3Appleyard S.M. Patterson T.A. Jin W. Chavkin C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2405-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This increase in KOR phosphorylation after agonist treatment coincided with an equivalent reduction in electrophysiological response to the KOR agonist and a significant reduction in the amount of immunoprecipitated protein detected, possible examples of agonist-induced receptor desensitization and internalization, respectively. However, determining the site of 32P incorporation into the KOR was not possible with this ex vivo model because of the low abundance of receptor in brain and uncertain stoichiometry of 32P labeling. Further evidence correlating KOR control mechanisms to agonist-induced phosphorylation of specific amino acids has come from site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent expression of receptors lacking potential phosphorylation sites in cell lines and heterologous gene expression systems, but this work has yielded contradictory results. For example, electrophysiological studies of Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type rat KOR (rKOR) demonstrated a G-protein receptor kinase (GRK)and β-arrestin-2-mediated desensitization of the κ agonist response that was blocked by substitution of KOR(S369A) but not KOR(T363A) or KOR(S356A,T357A) (4Appleyard S.M.

These results suggest that rKOR desensitization results from an agonist-induced phosphorylation of serine 369. Consistent with this finding Joseph and Bidlack (5Joseph D.B. Bidlack J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 970-976PubMed Google Scholar) reported that prolonged exposure to κ agonists can produced a substantial reduction in KOR expression in thymoma cells. However, others have reported that κ agonist treatment can produce rKOR desensitization without an increase in phosphorylation or receptor internalization (6Li J.-G. Luo L.Y. Krupnick J.G.

Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Taken together, the studies cited above suggest that the relationship between agonist-induced phosphorylation of specific sites within KOR and either receptor desensitization or internalization remains unclear. In addition, the direct identification of agonist-induced phosphorylation sites responsible for the desensitization or internalization of KOR has not been achieved. To address this question, we expressed rat KOR-GFP and KOR(S369A)-GFP fusion proteins in AtT-20 cells for electrophysiology studies of receptor desensitization and in HEK293 cells to examine receptor internalization under confocal microscopy. Moreover, we used immunocytochemistry and a newly generated antibody (KOR-P) selective for the phosphorylated form of serine 369 in the rKOR to directly determine whether agonist-induced phosphorylation of rKOR(S369) mediates either κ receptor desensitization or internalization. Chemicals—(±)-U50,488 was obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse drug supply program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and Sigma. Dynorphin A-(1–13) was obtained from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Belmont, CA). All other drugs were purchased from Sigma. Peptides and Antibody Production—A phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal domain of KOR designated KOR-P (RVRNTVQDPAS(PO4)MRD; matching amino acids 359–372) was synthesized and purified by PeptidoGenic Research and Co. (Livermore, CA). This peptide sequence was compared with known proteins using the GenBank™ data base, and no sequences in other proteins were found having >50% homology or four identical amino acids in a row. Purified peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through the N-terminal lysine, and KOR-P antibody was then produced and affinity-purified as described earlier (3Appleyard S.M. Patterson T.A. Jin W. Chavkin C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2405-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The two antibodies KT2 (raised against the C-terminal tail of the KOR) and KE-4 (raised against the predicted fourth extracellular loop of the rat KOR-(300–312), GSTSHSTAALSSY) were characterized as previously described (3Appleyard S.M.

Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Sterile 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 0.5 μg/well of either KOR-P peptide, KOR-Non-P peptide (a nonphosphorylated peptide otherwise identical to KOR-P), or peptides KE-4 or MOR-P (an unrelated peptide from the predicted sequence of the μ-opioid receptor, MOR-(171–184), HPVKALDFRT(PO4)PRNA in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. Unbound sites were blocked with 1% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C, and then the wells were washed three times with PBS-T (0.1 m PBS with 0.05% Tween 20). Affinity-purified KOR-P antibody, serially diluted to 0.05 from 10 μg/ml, was added to each well and incubated overnight at 4 °C under gentle agitation. Each concentration was tested in triplicate. Wells were washed three times with PBS-T and then incubated for 2 h in alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, diluted 1:3000 in PBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin. After washing the wells six times with PBS-T, the enzyme substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (1 mg/ml in 10% diethanolamine, 10% MgCl2, and 0.02% sodium azide, pH 9.8) was added and allowed to react for 30 min in the dark. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 2.5 m NaOH, and absorbance was promptly read at 410 nm for each well. Complementary DNA Clones, Mutagenesis of KOR to Produce KOR GFP and KOR(S369A)-GFP, and Production of Complementary RNA— The cDNA for GFP-37 (GenBank™ accession number U87624) was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) vector to produce pcDNA3-GFP37. Restriction sites for KpnI and BstXI were added to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the rat KOR sequence (thereby replacing the stop codon with the BstXI site) via PCR amplification. This KOR cDNA was digested and subcloned into the KpnI and BstXI sites of the pcDNA3-GFP37 vector with T4 DNA ligase as described elsewhere (9Befort K. Tabbara L. Bausch S. Chavkin C. Evans C. Kieffer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 216-223PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant KOR-GFP construct fused the GFP to the carboxyl-terminal tail of KOR. Point mutations were made in KOR-GFP to produce KOR(S369A)-GFP, using techniques described previously (10Rogalski S.L. Appleyard S.M. Pattillo A. Terman G.W. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-28088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. cDNA encoding for the κ receptors was used to make RNA as described previously (10Rogalski S.L. Appleyard S.M. Pattillo A. Terman G.W. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-28088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Construction of Cell Lines Expressing KOR-GFP or KOR(S369A)-GFP—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media/F-12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and AtT-20 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media high glucose medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Stable cell lines expressing KOR-GFP or KOR(S369A)-GFP protein in both types of cells were constructed by transfecting both cells with 10 μg of cDNA coding for KOR-GFP or KOR(S369A)-GFP proteins/well for 2–3 h using Superfect (Qiagen) reagent and the manufacturer's recommended protocol and then placing expressing cultures under selection pressure with G418 (0.4 μg/ml for HEK293 cultures; 1.5 μg/ml for AtT-20 cultures). Colonies expressing GFP were identified under fluorescence, isolated, and maintained under selection pressure for a minimum of 3 more weeks. Additionally, a small set of Xenopus laevis oocytes were microinjected with RNA coding for the wild type rKOR, KOR-GFP, or KOR(S369A)GFP receptors (4 ng/oocyte) along with RNA expressing the heteromeric inwardly rectifying potassium channels, KIR 3.1/3.2 (0.02 ng/oocyte) as described previously (10Rogalski S.L. Appleyard S.M. Pattillo A. Terman G.W. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-28088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Two-electrode Voltage Clamp and Whole-cell Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—To confirm the function of KOR-GFP and KOR (S369A)GFP as κ-opioid receptors, Xenopus oocytes expressing either fusion protein or wild type rKOR with KIR 3.1/3.2 were used in two-electrode voltage clamp recordings as described previously (10Rogalski S.L. Appleyard S.M. Pattillo A. Terman G.W. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-28088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Otherwise, AtT-20 cells stably expressing KOR-GFP or KOR(S369A)-GFP were grown on polylysine-coated coverslips for experimental use. Cells were used in patch clamp experiments in the whole-cell configuration with a pipette containing 130 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2,3mm Na2ATP, and 0.6 mm GTP, pH 7.25, in an external solution containing 40 mm KCl, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.35. Whole-cell potassium currents were acquired with an Axopatch 200 and Axotape (Axon Instruments) and then analyzed with Clampfit software (Axon Instruments). In the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp, cells were held at –45 mV and hyperpolarized to –100 mV for 50 ms every 5 s. Recorded traces represent average current during the hyperpolarization, plotted over time. Desensitization during agonist treatment was measured as the percentage change in response to agonist after a 60-min exposure to 100 nm U50,488. KOR-labeling Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy— Cells stably expressing KOR-GFP or KOR(S369A)-GFP were split onto polylysine-coated cover slips in 24-well plates for experimental use. Note that for experiments using the dominant negative mutant of GRK2, GRK(K220R)2, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with both 10 μg of KOR-GFP and 2 μg of GRK(K220R)2 cDNA, using the Superfect reagent as described above. After 48 h of protein expression, cells were treated at 37 °C as noted and prepared for immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy as described previously (11Coutts A.A. Anavi-Goffer S. Ross R.A. MacEwan D.J. Mackie K. Pertwee R.G. Irving A.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Either KT-2 (15 μg/ml) or KOR-P (4.5 μg/ml) was used as the primary antibody with fixed cells, incubated up to 70 h at 4 °C in 0.3% glycerin/PBS with 0.025% Triton-X. Lissamine-rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used as a secondary antibody to label the bound antibody. Both fluorochromes (GFP from the expressed protein and Rhodamine Red-bound KOR-P labeling) were viewed separately or simultaneously using a Bio-Rad confocal microscope (model MRC600) with COMOS 6.01 software. Data Analysis—To quantify the degree of internalization induced by agonist treatment of HEK293 cells, images collected with the confocal microscope were analyzed with NIH Image version 1.62 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) for the intensity of pixels within the cytoplasm of cells expressing KOR-GFP or KOR(S369A)GFP following medium or agonist treatment. To quantify the ratio of KOR-GFP receptors labeled by the KOR-P antibody, images collected by confocal microscopy were separated into green pixel-only images (showing GFP signaling) and red pixel-only images (showing antibody labeling) using Photoshop software (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Each image was analyzed for number of nonblack pixels, and a ratio of red to green pixels was generated for each original image taken (therefore, a value of 1.0 denotes complete and precise overlap of KOR-P/Rhodamine Red antibody labeling and green GFP signaling). Statistical significance throughout this study was defined by p < 0.05 as determined by Student's t test. Whole-cell AtT20 Electrophysiology Demonstrates the Involvement of Serine 369 in KOR Agonist Desensitization—Previous work with rat KOR expressed in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated the importance of serine 369 in desensitization of the wild type receptor (4Appleyard S.M. Celver J. Pineda V. Kovoor A. Wayman G.A. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23802-23807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the role of this residue in a mammalian expression system was not determined, and the analysis of cellular tolerance in Xenopus oocytes is limited by a lack of robust internalization of agonist-activated receptor in this expression system (data not shown). Therefore, we constructed GFP-tagged rat KOR and KOR(S369A) receptors and first checked whether the GFP tag adversely affected receptor functioning. When equal amounts of receptor cRNA were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, maximal activation (2–3 μm U50,488) of wild-type KOR, KOR-GFP, and KOR(S369A)-GFP increased KIR3.1/3.2 current and produced 1190 ± 645, 750 ± 378, and 1006 ± 1044 nA, respectively (n = 7–13 oocytes), for cells voltage clamped at –80 mV as previously described (10Rogalski S.L. Appleyard S.M. Pattillo A. Terman G.W. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-28088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These responses were not significantly different, and the results suggest that neither point mutation nor the addition of GFP to the C terminus of the KOR significantly affected receptor activation of KIR3.1/3.2 currents. Moreover, the KOR-GFP expressed in AtT20 cells showed robust receptor expression and cell surface distribution (Fig. 1C, a). KOR-GFP expressed in AtT20 cells that were patch-clamped in high potassium buffer as described under “Experimental Procedures” produced a strong potassium current in response to stimulation with the κ agonist, U50,488 that was antagonized by the κ-selective antagonist, nor-BNI (Fig. 1A). Likewise, activation of KOR(S369A)-GFP produced an equivalent potassium influx in response to U50,488 and at a similar magnitude to that of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 1B). After prolonged agonist incubation (100 nm U50,488, 1 h), the potassium channel response to 1 μm U50,488 by KOR-GFP was significantly reduced by 86%, whereas the KOR(S369A)-GFP response following the same treatment was unchanged (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that the KOR(S369A) residue was also important for receptor desensitization in a mammalian cell system. Whereas robust internalization of KOR-GFP was evident following stimulation with higher concentrations of U50,488 (10 μm, 1 h; Fig. 1C, c), the lower concentration (100 nm, 1-h treatment) that produced receptor desensitization did not increase receptor internalization (Fig. 1C, b), as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1C, a), suggesting that desensitization was not due to internalization. Development of κ-Opioid Receptor Antibodies Specific to the Serine 369-Phosphorylated Receptor—To develop a probe to detect phosphorylation of serine 369 in KOR, we generated and affinity-purified a polyclonal antibody (KOR-P) against a 14-amino acid peptide corresponding to rat KOR-(359–372) containing a phosphorylated serine 369 (Fig. 2A). Affinity-purified KOR-P antibody reacted up to 80 times more strongly in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against the phosphopeptide than the equivalent, nonphosphorylated sequence (Fig. 2B). The KOR-P antibody also failed to recognize peptides corresponding to the other regions of the κ receptor and unrelated, phosphorylated peptides (Fig. 2B). Demonstration of Immunocytochemical Labeling of KORGFP and KOR(S369A)-GFP by Two κ-Opioid Receptor-selective Antibodies—High levels of background GFP labeling in the cytosol of KOR-GFP or KOR(S369A)-GFP expressing AtT-20 cells made quantitation of receptor trafficking difficult. Therefore, HEK293 cells stably expressing either KOR-GFP or KOR(S369A)-GFP were used in immunocytochemistry experiments with either KT-2 (not phosphoselective) or KOR-P (phosphoselective) as the primary antibody. The lower cytosolic background staining evident in KOR-transfected HEK293 cells facilitated quantitation of receptor trafficking. Confocal microscopy revealed that KT-2 selectively immunolabeled both KORGFP and KOR(S369A)-GFP as the red KT-2 antibody labeling overlapped the green GFP fluorescent signal (Fig. 3, A–D). Incubation of HEK cells with 10 μm U50,488 produced clear internalization of KOR-GFP but not KOR(S369A)-GFP, as detected by KT-2 and localization of GFP fluorescence (Fig. 3, B and D). In contrast, untreated HEK cells expressing KOR-GFP were unlabeled by KOR-P (Fig. 4A), whereas KOR-P labeling was evident in cells treated with U50,488 (0.1–10 μm, 30 min at 37 °C) (Fig. 4, B–D). KOR-P labeling remained on the cell surface following treatment (30 min, 37 °C) with 0.1 and 1.0 μm U50,488. However, whereas these concentrations of U50,488 failed to produce characteristic signs of KOR-GFP internalization, incubation with 10 μm U50,488 (Fig. 4D) resulted in punctate structures and internalization of KOR-GFP evident by both KOR-P antibody labeling and GFP fluorescence. These effects were activation-dependent, since incubation with the KOR-selective antagonist nor-BNI did not produce either KOR-P antibody labeling or evidence of receptor trafficking (Fig. 4E). In addition, coincubation of nor-BNI with 10 μm U50,488 prevented both receptor trafficking and KOR-P antibody labeling (Fig. 4F). Agonist-induced increases in KOR-P labeling and receptor internalization were also evident after treatment with the κ-selective opioid peptide, dynorphin A-(1–13) (Fig. 4G), and labeling was again blocked by coincubation with nor-BNI (Fig. 4H). Preabsorbing the KOR-P antibody with the corresponding KOR-P peptide prevented antibody labeling following 10 μm U50,488 (Fig. 4I). In addition, HEK293 cells stably expressing KOR(S369A)-GFP failed to demonstrate KOR-P antibody labeling, either when untreated (Fig. 4J) or after incubation with 10 μm U50,488 (Fig. 4K). Finally, KOR-P antibody labeling was not evident in untransfected HEK293 cells treated with 10 μm U50,488 (Fig. 4L). The results suggest that KOR-P antibody could specifically detect the Ser369-phosphorylated form of KOR and that phosphorylated receptor could be detected at both the plasma membrane and in cytoplasmic structures following agonist treatment.Fig. 4KOR serine 369 is phosphorylated in a concentration-dependent manner by κ-opioid agonists to mediate receptor internalization. HEK293 cells were stably transfected with KOR-GFP or KOR(S369A)-GFP cDNA and were pretreated for 30 min at 37 °C with the drugs listed above each image. Cells were fixed, labeled with affinity-purified KOR-P antibody (4.5 μg/ml), and visualized with a rabbit IgG-Rhodamine Red secondary antibody using the confocal microscope. Panels represent the overlap of dual fluorescent GFP signals (excited at 488 nm) and fluorescent rhodamine-KOR-P antibody complex signals (at 568 nm); insets show only the Rhodamine Red KOR-P antibody labeling. KOR-P antibody did not label untreated cells (A). However, incubation with U50,488 (0.1–10 μm; B–D) produced a concentration-dependent increase in KOR-P antibody labeling that colocalized with the KOR-GFP receptor signaling. A high (10 μm) concentration of U50,488 also induced KOR-GFP receptor internalization (D). In contrast, incubation with the KOR-selective antagonist nor-BNI (10 μm) did not result in KOR-P labeling (E) but blocked the KOR-P antibody labeling and receptor trafficking induced by 10 μm U50,488 (F). Similar to the effects of U50,488, pretreatment with 10 μm dynorphin A-(1–13) resulted in strong KOR-P antibody labeling of KOR-GFP, receptor trafficking, and internalization (G). Coincubation of dynorphin A with the KOR-selective antagonist nor-BNI also blocked agonist-induced receptor trafficking and the increase in KOR-P antibody labeling of KOR-GFP (10 μm; H). U50,488 (10 μm)-induced KOR-P labeling of KOR-GFP was abolished by preblocking the KOR-P antibody with the serine-phosphorylated peptide corresponding to KOR-(359–372) prior to incubation with the cells, but agonist-induced internalization of KOR-GFP was unaffected (I). Notably, agonist-induced increases in KOR-P antibody labeling of the mutated receptor KOR(S369A)-GFP were not evident in samples either untreated (J) or exposed to 10 μm U50,488 pretreatment (K). Moreover, KOR-P antibody labeling was not detected in HEK cells not transfected with KOR-GFP, even after U50,488 treatment (L). All experiments were performed on 2–5 separate occasions, with images shown representative of multiple images taken from different areas of the coverslips.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Agonist-induced Phosphorylation of KOR-GFP in HEK293 Cells Is Mediated by a GRK—HEK293 cells stably expressing KOR-GFP incubated with 10 μm U50,488 for 30 min demonstrated robust KOR-GFP internalization and strong KOR-P antibody labeling (Fig. 5A). Neither receptor trafficking nor KOR-P labeling was prevented by pretreatment with either the protein kinase A/protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine (Fig. 5B), the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98,059 (Fig. 5D), or the phospholipase C inhibitor U73,122 (Fig. 5E). However, in HEK293 cells transiently expressing both KOR-GFP and the dominant negative mutant GRK2(K220R), U50,488 exposure was unable to induce receptor trafficking, and KOR-P antibody labeling was substantially reduced (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that agonist-induced phosphorylation of KOR-GFP serine 369 was mediated by a GRK in HEK293 cells. Agonist-induced Receptor Internalization Is Mediated by KOR Serine-369 in HEK293 Cells—Since previous results suggested that receptor internalization required the serine 369 phosphorylation site (Fig. 4K) and phosphorylation by GRK (Fig 5C), receptor internalization was quantified for both KORGFP (Fig. 6A) and the mutant KOR(S369A)-GFP (Fig. 6C). Treatment with 10 μm U50,488 induced clear receptor trafficking, with punctate, clustered KOR-GFP structures identified on the cell surface and internalized within the cytoplasm (Fig. 6B). Image quantitation showed a significant increase in the cytosolic pixel intensity following agonist treatment of cells expressing KOR-GFP (Fig. 6E). In contrast, KOR(S369A)-GFP did not show agonist-induced receptor trafficking (Fig. 6D), and a uniform distribution of the mutant receptor continued to be primarily localized in the plasma membrane (Fig. 6C). Quantitation of KOR(S369A)-GFP images revealed no increase in the cytoplasmic pixel intensity following U50,488 treatment (Fig. 6E).

https://openalex.org/W2001946573,"Human acid ceramidase was overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells by amplification of the transfected, full-length cDNA. The majority of the overexpressed enzyme was secreted into the culture media and purified to apparent homogeneity. The purified protein contained the same 13-(α) and 40 (β)–kDa subunits as human acid ceramidase from natural sources, had an acidic pH optimum (4.5), and followed normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics using 14C- and BODIPY-labeled C12-ceramide as substrates. Deglycosylation studies showed that the recombinant enzyme contained mostly “high mannose” type oligosaccharides and that two distinct β-subunits were present. Amino acid sequencing of these subunit polypeptides revealed a single N terminus, suggesting that the ∼2–4-kDa molecular mass difference was likely due to C-terminal processing. The purified enzyme also catalyzed ceramide synthesis in vitro using 14C-labeled C12 fatty acid and sphingosine as substrates. Surprisingly, we found that media from the overexpressing hamster cells had increased acid sphingomyelinase activity and that this activity could be co-precipitated with acid ceramidase using anti-ceramidase antibodies. Overexpression of acid ceramidase in normal human skin fibroblasts also led to enhanced acid sphingomyelinase secretion, but this was not observed in Niemann-Pick disease cells. RNA studies showed that this increased activity was not due to overexpression of the endogenous acid sphingomyelinase gene.

Ceramide serves as the precursor for most sphingolipids and is a signaling molecule that induces apoptosis in a number of different cell types (reviewed in Refs. 1Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar and 2Kolesnick R. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 10: 3-8Crossref Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In contrast, sphingosine is converted into sphingosine 1-phosphate, another important cell signaling lipid that is “anti-apoptotic” and can counteract the effects of ceramide (reviewed in Refs. 3Spiegel S.

The only source of sphingosine in vertebrate cells is through ceramide hydrolysis, whereas ceramide can be generated by synthetic pathways or through the degradation of sphingomyelin or glycosphingolipids (5Merrill Jr., A.H.

Several ceramidases have been described in vertebrates that function at varying pH values and presumably reside in distinct intracellular locations. An acidic ceramidase (i.e. AC) was first described and partially purified by Gatt in 1963 (8Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3131-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 1972, patients with the lipid storage disorder, Farber disease (Farber Lipogranulomatosis), were found to have a marked deficiency of this enzymatic activity (9Moser H.W. Linke T. Fensom A.H. Levade T. Sandhoff K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Valle D. Sly W.S. The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3573-3588Google Scholar). In 1995, human AC was purified to apparent homogeneity from urine (10Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

Processing studies performed in human skin fibroblasts revealed that human AC was first synthesized as an ∼55-kDa precursor that was proteolytically processed into the two subunits within late endosomes or lysosomes. Most of the enzyme was found within cells, presumably in acidic compartments, but small amounts of the precursor and a partially processed 47-kDa form were found extracellularly. The β-subunit contains five N-linked oligosaccharide chains, several of which are of the “complex” type (i.e. resistant to digestion with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) (11Ferlinz K. Kopal G. Bernardo K.

We find that many properties of the recombinant enzyme are similar to those reported previously for enzyme obtained from natural sources and that in addition to ceramide degradation, recombinant AC could catalyze ceramide synthesis using free fatty acid and sphingosine as substrates. Of note, the pH optima for the degradative and synthetic reactions were distinct. In addition, we report that overexpression of human AC in CHO cells or human skin fibroblasts leads to elevated acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) activity in the media. Additional studies revealed that the secreted AC from the overexpressing CHO media existed in two molecular forms, one associated with ASM and the other not. [lauryl-1-14C]d-Erythrosphingosine (14C-labeled C12-ceramide), [1-14C]lauric acid, and [choline methyl-14C]sphingomyelin were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). BODIPY-conjugated C12 sphingomyelin and C12 fatty acid were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). BODIPY-conjugated C12-ceramide was synthesized as described previously (19Dagan A. Agmon V. Gatt S. Dinur T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 293-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard tissue culture media and other tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen, with the exception of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), which was obtained from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT), and UltraCULTURE medium without serum supplements, from BioWhittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Tissue culture plasticware and all organic solvents were purchased from Fisher. Concanavalin A-Sepharose, Blue Sepharose, and Superose 12 were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Precast 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels and a Colloidal Blue staining kit were from Invitrogen. Nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell. A cDNA probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) was obtained from Clontech Laboratories Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). A commercial adenoviral vector (type 2) was from Invitrogen. Peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNG F), Endo H, and sialidase A (neuraminidase) were purchased from Prozyme Inc. (San Leandro, CA). A protein determination kit was purchased from BioRad. All other biochemical reagents were from Sigma. A full-length human AC cDNA (11Ferlinz K. Kopal G. Bernardo K. Linke T. Breiden B. Neumann U. Lang F. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35352-35360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) was inserted into the p91023(B) mammalian expression vector (20Ioannou Y.A. Bishop D.F. Desncik R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1137-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21He X. Miranda S.R. Xiong X. Dagan A. Gatt S. Schuchman E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The vector was then transfected into dihydrofolate reductase negative (dhfr–) DG44 CHO cells, and stably transfected clones were selected for their ability to grow in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS but lacking hypoxanthine (0.05 mm) and thymidine (0.008 mm). Non-transfected DG44 cells require these supplements to grow. Over 250 surviving colonies were isolated in this manner, expanded, and then plated in medium containing 0.02 μm methotrexate. After 2 weeks, surviving clones were isolated, expanded, and placed into medium containing 0.1 μm methotrexate. A similar selection/expansion procedure was used to eventually isolate 5 clones that survived in medium containing 20 μm methotrexate. Of these, one clone, designated CHO6, was selected for further analysis based on its high AC activity. Parental CHO cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, hypoxanthine (0.05 mm), and thymidine (0.008 mm). The procedure described below summarizes the typical purification of human AC from 250 ml of CHO6 medium containing 5% FBS. The medium was centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove debris, concentrated 20 times using a 100-kDa cut-off ultrafiltration membrane (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) to reduce serum components (e.g. BSA), and stored at 4 °C before processing through the following purification steps. Prior studies had revealed that more than 90% of the AC activity was retained by this membrane, consistent with the fact that the native molecular mass of the recombinant enzyme was ∼150-kDa (see “Results”). Step 1: Concanavalin A-Sepharose (Con A)—The concentrated medium was slowly applied to a 10-ml Con A column that had been equilibrated with 10× bed volume of Con A wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1% Igepal CA-630, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.2). The column was attached to an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatograph (Amersham Biosciences). The washing, pre-elution, and elution steps were carried out with Con A wash buffer, pre-elution buffer (Con A wash buffer containing 10 mm methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside), and elution buffer (Con A wash buffer containing 1 m methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside), respectively, and monitored using a UV detector. The flow rates were maintained at 2, 1, and 0.5 ml/min during the washing, pre-elution, and elution steps, respectively. Fractions from the elution step containing the highest AC activity were pooled, concentrated to less than 10 ml using a 100-kDa ultrafiltration membrane, and then diluted and re-concentrated three times in the presence of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, at 4 °C (for buffer exchange). Step 2: Blue Sepharose —The concentrated Con A eluant was loaded onto a Blue Sepharose column (5 ml) that had been equilibrated with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 0.1% Igepal CA-630). Bound proteins were eluted from the column using a NaCl gradient (from 0 to 1 m) in washing buffer. The flow rates were maintained at 2, 0.3, and 0.5 ml/min during the washing, loading, and elution steps, respectively. Two peaks of AC activity were obtained from this column (see “Results” and Fig. 7), and each was concentrated to less than 2 ml using a 100-kDa ultrafree centrifugal column (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The “low salt” fraction was routinely used for further purification and thus diluted and re-concentrated three times in the presence of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, at 4 °C for buffer exchange and subsequent gel filtration. Step 3: Superose 12 Gel Filtration—The concentrated, low salt material from the Blue Sepharose column was loaded onto a 106-ml Superose 12 column (1.6 × 53 cm, XK16/70, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 5× bed volume of running buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 0.1% Igepal CA-630). The flow rate was maintained at 0.2 ml/min. The eluate was collected in 1-ml fractions after the void volume (37 ml). Fractions containing the highest AC activity were pooled, washed, and concentrated three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, using a 100-kDa ultrafree centrifugal column at 4 °C and concentrated to a final protein concentration above 1 mg/ml. Throughout the purification procedure, AC activity was detected using a modified, fluorescence-based high performance liquid chromatograph method (22He X. Li C.M. Park J.H. Dagan A. Gatt S. Schuchman E.H. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The standard 10-μl AC assay mixture consisted of 5 μl of enzyme source and 5 μl of 0.2 m citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 4.5) containing 200 μm BODIPY-conjugated C12-ceramide, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% BSA, and 0.2% Igepal CA-630. Assays were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min. After the reactions were complete, 5 μl of the assay mixtures were removed and pipetted into 95 μl of ethanol, mixed, and then centrifuged for 5 min for 10,000 × g. The supernatants were then transferred to a Waters glass sampling vial, and 5 μl (2.5% of the original reaction mixture) was auto-sampled by a WIPS 712 (Waters) autosampler onto a high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a reverse-phase column (BetaBasic-18, 4.6 × 30 mm, Keystone Scientific Inc., Bellefonte, PA), and eluted isocratically with methanol/water (95:5 v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fluorescence was quantified using a Waters 474 fluorescence detector set to excitation and emission wavelengths of 505 and 540 nm, respectively. The undigested substrate and product (i.e. BODIPY-conjugated C12-ceramide and fatty acid, respectively) peaks were identified by comparing their retention times with standards, and the amount of product was calculated using a regression equation that was established from a standard curve using BODIPY-conjugated C12 fatty acid. For certain experiments, AC activity also was detected using a radiolabeled substrate (14C-labeled C12-ceramide). The reactions were prepared and carried out as described above for the BODIPY-conjugated substrate. After the reactions were complete, the assay mixtures were spotted onto a TLC plate, and the product, [14C]lauric acid, was separated from the 14C-labeled C12-ceramide substrate using a solvent consisting of chloroform, methanol, 28% ammonium hydroxide (90:20:0.5, v/v). The TLC plate was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen that was subsequently scanned by a PhosphorImager system (Storm 860, Amersham Biosciences). The undigested substrate and product were identified by co-migration with standards, and the signal was quantified using the ImageQuant software. Total protein was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The standard 10-μl ASM assay mixture consisted of 5 μl of enzyme source and 5 μl of assay buffer (200 μm BODIPY-conjugated C12-sphingomyelin, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 0.2% Igepal CA-630, 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0) (23He X. Chen F. Dagan A. Gatt S. Schuchman E.H. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 314: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Assays were generally carried out at 37 °C for 1 h. After the reactions were complete, 5 μl of the assay mixtures were removed and quantified as described above for AC. The undigested substrate and product (i.e. BODIPY-conjugated sphingomyelin and ceramide, respectively) peaks were identified by comparing their retention times with standards, and the amount of product was calculated using a regression equation that was established from a standard curve using BODIPY-conjugated C12-ceramide. ASM activity also was determined using choline-radiolabeled [14C]sphingomyelin as a substrate. Other components of the reaction mixtures were the same as those described above for BODIPY-conjugated sphingomyelin. Following a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the samples were spotted onto a TLC plate and dried. The product and substrate ([14C]sphingomyelin and [14C]choline phosphate, respectively) were separated using a running buffer of chloroform/methanol/H2O (5:4:1, v/v). The radioactive signals were visualized and quantified using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager system. The reverse activity of purified AC was measured using [1-14C]lauric acid and sphingosine as substrates. The standard reaction mixture contained 5 μl of enzyme source and 5 μl of 200 mm citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), containing 200 μm [14C]lauric acid, 100 μm sphingosine, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then terminated by spotting onto a TLC plate and drying immediately using a hairdryer. The product, [14C]ceramide, was separated from the substrates using a running buffer of chloroform:methanol:28% ammonium hydroxide (90:20:0.5, v/v). The TLC plate was exposed to PhosphorImager screen that was subsequently quantified by a PhosphorImager system (Storm 860). The radioactive product ([14C]-ceramide) and substrate ([14C]lauric acid) were identified by co-migration with standards, and the signals were quantified by the ImageQuant software. Samples were boiled in loading buffer (12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 0.5% SDS, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) for 10 min, loaded onto 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoresed in an XCELL II mini-cell apparatus (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) for 1 h. The voltage was maintained at 150 V, and the running buffer contained 0.1% SDS. Following electrophoresis, the gel was stained using either Colloidal Blue or Silver according to the manufacturer's instructions. To evaluate the effects of various glycosidases on the purified AC, 5 μg of the enzyme was added to a 25-μl reaction mixture containing Endo H (5 milliunits), PNG F (5 units), or sialidase (5 milliunits) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5, 7.5, and 5.0, respectively). The purified AC was first denatured by heating at 100 °C for 5 min in the presence of 0.1% SDS and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol and then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h after adding Endo H and PNG-F. The heat denaturation step was omitted for the sialidase reaction. After digestion with the individual glycosidases, the samples were boiled in SDS/dithiothreitol, electrophoresed on 4–20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels, and stained with Colloidal Blue. To investigate the expression levels of the ASM mRNAs in the parental and transfected CHO cells, total RNA was isolated from CHO and CHO6 cells using the RNeasy mini kit, separated by formaldehyde-denatured agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to Zeta-Probe GT Blotting membranes. Hybridization was performed using a cDNA fragment from murine ASM (nucleotides 1–283) (24Newrzella D. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in QuickHyb hybridization solution at 68 °C for 1.5 h. This region of the mouse ASM sequence has greater than 90% nucleotide identity with the hamster ASM sequence (24Newrzella D. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), 2X. He, N. Okino, R. Dhami, A. Dagan, S. Gatt, H. Schulze, K. Sandhoff, and E. H. Schuchman, unpublished observations. facilitating identification of the endogenous hamster ASM RNA. The hybridized membranes were washed with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min and then with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 58 °C for 15 min. The radioactive, hybridized signals were visualized and quantified using the STORM imaging analyzer. The Northern blots were also hybridized with a human housekeeping cDNA fragment (G3PDH) as a control. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against purified, recombinant AC (i.e. the LSP fraction from Blue Sepharose, see Fig. 7). For immunoprecipitation studies, CHO6 medium was mixed 1:2 with binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and then 30 μl of either rabbit preimmune serum or anti-AC serum was added and incubated for1hat4 °C. 50 μl of a 50% slurry containing protein A-Sepharose and binding buffer was then added to the mixtures and rocked gently for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were centrifuged (13,000 × g) and washed 3 times with binding buffer, and the final pellets were then resuspended in appropriate buffers for the determination of individual enzyme activities (see Table II).Table IIImmunoprecipitation of lysosomal enzyme activities from CHO6 media using anti-AC antibodiesEnzymePreimmune serumAnti-AC serumRatio (immune/preimmune)nmol/h/ml aPer ml of protein A-Sepharose gel; see “Experimental Procedures” and individual references for specific assay procedures.

Open table in a new tab The full-length human AC cDNA was inserted into a commercial adenoviral vector (type 2), and recombinant virus was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. One day prior to infection, human skin fibroblasts (from a normal individual or patient with type A Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) were subcultured at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells/well in 12-well culture plates. Cells were infected using 0.25 ml of medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum) containing mock virus (control) or the AC recombinant virus. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, an additional 0.5 ml of medium was added to each well. Two days after infection, the cells were washed, and 0.6 ml of fresh UltraCULTURE medium without serum supplements was added. After 3 days, the culture media was collected, and the AC and ASM activities were determined as described above. Macrophages were obtained from the lung air spaces of normal and ASM knockout mice as described previously (25Dhami R. He X. Gordon R.E. Elleder M. Schuchman E.H. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and were cultured in RPMI media containing 10% FBS at 37 °C. The cells were incubated overnight, washed 3× with phosphate-buffered saline, and then fresh media was mixed (1:1, v/v) with conditioned CHO6 or parental CHO media and added to the culture flasks. These conditioned media were obtained by growing CHO6 or parental CHO cells for 48 h prior to the macrophage uptake studies. The macrophages were grown in the presence of the conditioned media (or standard RPMI medium as a control) for an additional 72 h at 37 °C and then harvested and centrifuged at 3000 × g. After washing the cells several times with phosphate-buffered saline, AC and ASM activities were determined in the cell homogenates as described above. Overexpression and Purification of Human AC—The human AC cDNA was overexpressed in CHO cells using a methotrexate gene amplification system (20Ioannou Y.A. Bishop D.F. Desncik R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1137-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21He X. Miranda S.R. Xiong X. Dagan A. Gatt S. Schuchman E.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Table I shows a typical purification from 250 ml of media. AC-specific activity was enriched ∼60-fold in the final preparations, and ∼2 mg of pure enzyme was obtained. Notably, AC activity was eluted from the Blue Sepharose column in two fractions (see below and Fig. 7), but unless otherwise mentioned, the analyses described within were performed using the “low salt fraction.” Fig. 1 shows SDS-PAGE analysis at each step of the purification. In the final Superose 12 eluant (lane 4), only three bands were visible using Colloidal Blue or Silver2 staining, corresponding in molecular mass to the AC α- and β-subunits (∼13 and 40-kDa, respectively) and precursor protein (∼55-kDa) (10Bernardo K.

https://openalex.org/W1993618835,"A single candidate 4′-phosphopantetheine transferase, identified by BLAST searches of the human genome sequence data base, has been cloned, expressed, and characterized. The human enzyme, which is expressed mainly in the cytosolic compartment in a wide range of tissues, is a 329-residue, monomeric protein. The enzyme is capable of transferring the 4′-phosphopantetheine moiety of coenzyme A to a conserved serine residue in both the acyl carrier protein domain of the human cytosolic multifunctional fatty acid synthase and the acyl carrier protein associated independently with human mitochondria. The human 4′-phosphopantetheine transferase is also capable of phosphopantetheinylation of peptidyl carrier and acyl carrier proteins from prokaryotes. The same human protein also has recently been implicated in phosphopantetheinylation of the α-aminoadipate semialdehyde dehydrogenase involved in lysine catabolism (Praphanphoj, V., Sacksteder, K. A., Gould, S. J., Thomas, G. H., and Geraghty, M. T. (2001) Mol. Genet. Metab. 72, 336–342). Thus, in contrast to yeast, which utilizes separate 4′-phosphopantetheine transferases to service each of three different carrier protein substrates, humans appear to utilize a single, broad specificity enzyme for all posttranslational 4′-phosphopantetheinylation reactions.

Thus, in contrast to yeast, which utilizes separate 4′-phosphopantetheine transferases to service each of three different carrier protein substrates, humans appear to utilize a single, broad specificity enzyme for all posttranslational 4′-phosphopantetheinylation reactions. The fatty acid synthases (FASs) 1The abbreviations used are: FAS, fatty acid synthase; PKS, polyketide synthase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; ACPmit, mitochondrial acyl carrier protein; ACPfas, acyl carrier protein domain of the fatty acid synthase; PPTase, 4′-phosphopantetheine transferase; Sfp, 4′-phoshopantetheine transferase involved in surfactin production in B. subtilis; PCP, peptidyl carrier protein; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; EST, expressed sequence tag; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; TEV, tobacco etch virus. associated with the soluble cytoplasm of yeast and animal cells comprise large multifunctional polypeptides that contain all of the catalytic components required for the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids from malonyl-CoA de novo. These multifunctional polypeptides are commonly referred to as type I FASs. The animal FASs consist of two identical polypeptides of approximately 2500 residues (α2), whereas the yeast FAS comprises six copies each of two nonidentical polypeptides (α6β6; α = 1845, β = 1887 residues) (1Smith S. Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 2Kolodziej S.J. Penczek P.A. Schroeter J.P. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28422-28429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In most bacteria and in plant plastids, the various catalytic components of the FAS are present on separate discrete polypeptides and are commonly referred to as type II FASs (3Heath R. Jackowski S. Rock C. Vance D. Je V. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. 4th Ed. Elsevier, Amsterdam2002: 55-92Google Scholar). An essential component of both type I and type II systems is a small molecular mass domain/polypeptide known as an acyl carrier protein (ACP) that is posttranslationally modified, by insertion of a 20-Å-long phosphopantetheinyl moiety, derived from CoA, to a positionally conserved serine residue (4Lambalot R.H.

The terminal sulfhydryl of the phosphopantetheinyl moiety provides the site of covalent attachment of the substrates and the growing fatty acyl chain, so that the phosphopantetheine plays an essential role as a “swinging arm” in the translocation of intermediates between different catalytic sites of the FASs (5Lynen F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 112: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). ACPs fulfill a similar role in the type I and type II polyketide synthases (PKSs) found mainly in bacteria and fungi that are capable of elaborating a broad range of secondary metabolites. Fungi (6Brody S. Mikolajczyk S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Schneider R. Massow M. Lisowsky T. Weiss H. Curr. Genet. 1995; 29: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), animal, and plant cells also contain a type II FAS system in their mitochondria. The role of the mitochondrial FASs is not well established, but it has been suggested that, at least in fungi and plants, they may serve to provide octanoate, the precursor of lipoic acid and/or long-chain fatty acids that are used in the remodeling of mitochondrial phospholipids (7Schneider R.

Phosphopantetheinylated carrier proteins also play an essential role as components of the non-ribosomal peptide synthases found in microorganisms that are responsible for producing a variety of short peptides containing both proteogenic and unusual amino acids (13Weber T. Marahiel M.A. Structure. 2001; 9: R3-R9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The nonribosomal peptide synthases also comprise multifunctional polypeptides in which the role of the carrier protein domain is to translocate amino acyl moieties from an adenylation domain to a condensation domain, where formation of a new peptide bond takes place (14Cane D.E. Walsh C.T. Khosla C. Science. 1998; 282: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Enzymes capable of phosphopantetheinylating carrier proteins involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids, polyketides, and peptides have been identified and characterized from a variety of sources. Many organisms have more than one phosphopantetheine transferase (PPTase), and different PPTases commonly are utilized to service carrier proteins associated with FASs and non-ribosomal peptide synthases within the same species (4Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 15Mootz H.D. Finking R. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37289-37298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Yeast utilizes separate PPTases for phosphopantetheinylation of the ACP domain of the cytosolic type I FAS and the mitochondrial type II ACP. Remarkably, the former is actually a constituent domain of the α-subunit of the type I cytosolic FAS, so that this protein is capable of self-phosphopantetheinylation (16Fichtlscherer F. Wellein C. Mittag M. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2666-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas the latter is a separate PPTase that acts only on the mitochondrial ACP (17Stuible H.P. Meier S. Wagner C. Hannappel E. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22334-22339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PPTases have been classified into three groups, based on sequence and structural similarity and substrate specificity (15Mootz H.D. Finking R. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37289-37298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Members of the first group, typified by the AcpS of Esch-erichia coli,are characteristically ∼120 residues long, function as homotrimers, and have fairly narrow substrate specificities limited to the ACPs of type II FAS and PKS systems (18Suo Z. Tseng C.C. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Members of the second group, typified by the Sfp of Bacillus subtilis, are usually at least 240 residues long, function as monomers, and have very broad substrate specificities that include carrier proteins associated with non-ribosomal peptide synthases, FASs, and PKSs (18Suo Z. Tseng C.C. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Quadri L.E. Weinreb P.H. Lei M. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Membership in the third group is reserved for those PPTases that are attached covalently to type I FASs, such as that associated with the yeast cytosolic FAS (16Fichtlscherer F. Wellein C. Mittag M. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2666-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The PPTases involved in phosphopantetheinylation of the ACPs involved in fatty acid synthesis in animals have not yet been identified. Thus, the objective of this study was to identify the PPTase(s) responsible for posttranslational modification of the ACP domain of the type I cytosolic FAS and the ACP associated with the type II mitochondrial FAS in humans. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Human PPTase—Based on the available sequence information (accession nos. GI 7106836, GI 9295190, and EST cDNA ATCC 1849005), PCR primers (Table I) were designed to amplify full-length (∼1 kb) putative human PPTase cDNA from human liver and brain cDNA libraries (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The PCR procedure employed was essentially as described previously (20Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22508-22513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To improve the specificity of the PCR, two sets of primers were used to amplify cDNA. The first round of PCR, with primer pair T4/B3 and template DNA from the two human cDNA libraries, resulted in the amplification of an expected sized (∼1 kb) product, indicating the presence of PPTase transcripts in both the libraries. The amplified DNA from the first round PCR reaction was then used as template for the second round, using a nested PPTase-specific primer pair T2/B1. Again, an amplified product of ∼1 kb was obtained using DNA template arising from both human cDNA libraries. The amplified fragment from the two sources was purified, using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), digested at KpnI and PstI sites that had been engineered into the amplification primers T2 and B1, respectively, and cloned into the E. coli expression vector pQE80 L (Qiagen). To facilitate purification of the encoded proteins by metal ion affinity chromatography, a cleavable His6 tag was engineered at the start of the cloned cDNAs. Authenticity of the cloned PCR fragments was confirmed by DNA sequencing using vector-specific primers. The sequences of the amplified cDNAs from the two libraries were found to be identical. The amino acid sequence of the encoded protein is shown in Fig. 1. Protein expression from the cloned cDNA was attempted in E. coli DH5α and BL21-codon plus strains; however, most of the expressed PPTase was found to be present in inclusion bodies.Table IPCR primers used in this studyPrimersSequenceLocationaThe base pair numbers for PPTase T9 correspond to Tev.

Open table in a new tab To overcome this problem, the cDNA encoding the putative human PPTase in pQE80 L was reamplified using PPTase primers T9 and B5 and cloned into a modified baculoviral transfer vector, pFast Bac 1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), using appropriate restriction sites engineered into the two primers. Authenticity of the cDNA sequence was confirmed, recombinant baculoviral stocks were generated, and the encoded protein was expressed in Sf9 insect cells, using the Bac-To-Bac baculoviral expression system (Invitrogen), according to the instructions from the manufacturer. The infected Sf9 cells were homogenized at 4 °C in buffer A (250 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 10% glycerol) and centrifuged at 4 °C, 144,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was filtered (0.45 μm) and loaded at 20 °C onto a 5-ml HiTrap Chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer A and 40 ml of buffer B (60 mm imidazole in buffer A), and bound proteins were eluted with a 100-ml gradient of 60–400 mm imidazole in buffer A. Fractions containing the enzyme were pooled and dialyzed at 4 °C against buffer C (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 10% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Recombinant PPTase was further purified at 20 °C by HPLC using a column of DE-53 anion exchanger equilibrated with buffer C. The unbound protein fraction, containing PPTase activity, was collected and concentrated at 4 °C using a Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience AG, Hannover, Germany). The purified PPTase protein was stored at –70 °C, typically at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Cloning and Expression of the ACP Domain of the Human Cytosolic FAS (ACPfas)—Appropriate primers (Table I) were used to amplify a fragment, from human liver and brain cDNA libraries, corresponding to residues 2117–2205 of the human FAS. To facilitate purification of the encoded protein by nickel ion affinity chromatography, a cleavable N-terminal His6 tag was encoded in the ACPfas. The amplified fragments from the two sources were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), digested at the KpnI and HindIII sites that had been engineered into the amplification primers ACPfas T and ACPfas B, respectively, and cloned into the E. coli expression vector pQE80 L (Qiagen), using standard ligation and transformation procedures. Authenticity of the cloned PCR fragments from the two libraries was confirmed by DNA sequencing, using vector-specific primers. The clones derived from liver and brain libraries had identical sequences. The encoded amino acid sequence is shown in Fig. 1. The recombinant plasmid was expressed in the E. coli BL21-codon plus strain. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium to A 600 of 0.5–0.7 and induced with 1 mm IPTG for 3 h. Cells were suspended in 0.25 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 10% glycerol and protease inhibitors, and lysed using a French pressure cell press. The lysate was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The recombinant ACP was purified from the soluble extract of E. coli cells, by a combination of nickel ion affinity chromatography and gel filtration. The soluble extract was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated with 0.25 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, and 10% glycerol. The column was then washed sequentially with the equilibration buffer containing 50, 100, and 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing ACPfas (eluting at 100 mm imidazole) were pooled, concentrated using a Vivaspin concentrator, and chromatographed on a column of Biogel P30 (40 × 1.4 cm column eluted with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, at 13 ml/h, 20 °C). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the Human Mitochondrial ACP (ACPmit)—Based on BLAST searches of the human genome sequence data base, using authentic type I and type II ACPs, we identified a putative ACPmit sequence that was represented in two human EST clones (IMAGE clones 4799845 and 4816243). Sequence alignments with authentic type II ACP sequences indicated that these ESTs likely encoded a full-length human ACPmit, together with an N-terminal extension of ∼67 residues that could constitute a mitochondrial targeting sequence. Specific primers, ACPmit T1/B1 (Table I) with appropriate restriction sites, were designed, and the cDNA encoding the putative ACPmit was amplified using the PCR, essentially as described previously (20Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22508-22513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amplified fragments from the two sources were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), then cleaved at the introduced KpnI and PstI sites and cloned into the E. coli expression vector pQE80 L (Qiagen). To facilitate purification of the encoded protein by metal-ion affinity chromatography, a cleavable His6 tag was encoded at the start of the cDNA. Authenticity of the cloned, amplified fragments was confirmed by DNA sequencing using vector-specific primers. The sequences of the amplified fragments from the two IMAGE clones were found to be identical. The sequence of the encoded protein is shown in Fig. 1. The cloned cDNA was expressed in E. coli BL21-codon plus strain. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium to a density equivalent to A 600 of 0.5–0.7 and induced with 1 mm IPTG for 3 h. However, no recombinant protein could be detected. Induction of protein expression resulted in rapid cessation of cell growth, suggesting that expression of this protein interferes with the host cell metabolism. Lowering the IPTG concentration or growth temperature, reducing the induction time, or using alternative host strains and expression vectors did not improve expression. To overcome this difficulty, the ACPmit gene was re-amplified using two sets of primers, ACPmitT2/B2 (contains the putative mitochondrial targeting sequence) and ACPmitT3/B2 (no targeting sequence) (see Table I). The two amplified fragments were cloned into a modified baculoviral transfer vector pFast Bac 1 (Invitrogen), using appropriate restriction sites that had been engineered into the primers. Coding sequences for a C-terminal His6 tag were engineered into these constructs to facilitate subsequent protein purification by metal ion affinity chromatography. Authenticity of the DNA sequences was confirmed, recombinant baculoviral stocks were generated, and the protein expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the Bac-To-Bac baculoviral expression system (Invitrogen). The recombinant ACPmit expressed with the mitochondrial targeting sequence present was found predominantly in the mitochondrial pellet, both as processed and unprocessed protein. In contrast, the recombinant ACPmit expressed without the targeting sequence was found to be expressed exclusively in the cytosol. For purification of the cytosolic form, insect cells were homogenized at 4 °C in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) and centrifuged at 4 °C, 144,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was filtered (0.45 μm) and loaded onto a HiTrap Chelating HP column (5 ml bed volume) at 20 °C. The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer B (5 mm imidazole in buffer A). The bound proteins were eluted with a 125-ml gradient of 5–125 mm imidazole in buffer A, followed by a 25-ml gradient of 125–250 mm imidazole in buffer A. Fractions containing the enzyme were pooled and the sample buffer was changed to buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol) at 4 °C, using a Vivaspin concentrator (5,000 M r cutoff). ACPmit was further purified at 20 °C by HiTrap Q HP anion exchange column (1 ml bed volume; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer C. The bound proteins were eluted with a 20-ml gradient of 0–250 mm NaCl in buffer C followed by a 5-ml gradient of 250–500 mm NaCl in buffer C. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing the apo or holo form were stored separately at –80 °C. Expression of the Peptidyl Carrier Protein (PCP) and Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP-A) from B. brevis and B. subtilis, Respectively—E. coli cells harboring plasmids encoding C-terminally His6-tagged versions of ACP-A (M15 pQE60[acpA]; Ref. 15Mootz H.D.

Marahiel at the Institut für Biochemie, Fachbereich Chemie, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany. Cells were grown at 37 °C to a density equivalent to A 600 of 0.7, and protein expression was induced with 1 mm IPTG for 3–4 h at either 37 °C (M15) or 30 °C (BL21). Proteins were purified by affinity chromatography by nickel ion affinity chromatography. Assay of Human PPTase Activity—Typical assay systems contained 75–83 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 10 mm MgCl2, 66–100 μm [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (or CoASH), 20 μm human apo-ACP, and 0.05–2 μg of human PPTase. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 2–5 min. Proteins were precipitated with acid, washed, and assayed for radioactivity. In those experiments where CoASH was used in place of [1-14C]acetyl-CoA, samples were processed for electrospray mass spectrometry. Analysis of PPTase by Gel Filtration Chromatography—To determine the molecular mass of native PPTase, a purified preparation (10 μg) was applied to a BioSep-SEC-S 3000 gel filtration column (300 × 7.8 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA.), equilibrated and eluted at 20 °C with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was calibrated with various protein molecular mass standards. Electrospray Mass Spectrometry—Sample was desalted using a C4 ZipTip (Millipore, Bedford, MS), mixed with the matrix (sinapinic acid, 10 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile plus 0.1% trifluoracetic acid) in a 1:1 ratio (v/v), and 1 μl of the resulting mixture was deposited on the top of pre-crystallized matrix and spotted onto a stainless steel matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization plate. Analysis was performed on a Voyager-DE™ STR matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight biospectrometry workstation (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a positive linear mode. Mass scale was externally calibrated utilizing bovine insulin and horse heart myoglobin. Singly charged ions were used for a molecular mass determination. Reported masses represent averages of the results of six acquisitions, and they have been determined within a standard deviation of 1–2 Da. Tissue Specificity of Expression of Human PPTase—A 32P-labeled probe was synthesized by the random priming method using [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), a PCR-amplified PPTase template cDNA, and a NEBlot kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). A human multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech) was probed with the purified radiolabeled probe (∼2 × 106 dpm/blot), using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech). The amount of poly(A)+ RNA in each lane of the Clontech blot (∼2 μg) has been adjusted to obtain a consistent signal for a housekeeping gene (β-actin) across all lanes. The blot was analyzed using a phosphorimager (Storm 840, Amersham Biosciences). Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 5 volumes of mitochondrial isolation buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.35, 1 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche Applied Science). The cellular suspension was disrupted, using a Teflon/glass homogenizer, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and further centrifuged at 104,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the mitochondrial pellet was washed twice with isolation buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer. The mitochondria were then ruptured by three cycles of freezing and thawing and the addition of Lubrol (0.1 mg/mg of protein). The 104,000 × g supernatant (cytosol) was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of isolation buffer. Protein concentrations of all three subcellular fractions were determined by the Bradford assay and the fractions stored at –80 °C. The activity of citrate synthase, a mitochondrial matrix enzyme, was assayed (22Alp P.R. Newsholme E.A. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1976; 154: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) in each subcellular fraction to assess the possibility that mitochondria had been damaged during preparation of the homogenate. Cloning and Expression of a Human PPTase—Initial BLAST searches of the GenBank™ sequence data base, using the sequences of various PPTases of the small molecular mass PPTase type, did not reveal a likely candidate for a human PPTase enzyme. However, BLAST searching with a PPTase probe sequence of the high molecular weight type, namely the B. subtilis surfactin synthetase-activating enzyme, Sfp, revealed a candidate human PPTase sequence that was subsequently used to derive full-length cDNAs, by PCR, from human liver and brain cDNA libraries and from a human EST cDNA clone. The putative human PPTase cDNAs obtained from the three sources had identical DNA sequences. When expressed in E. coli, this cDNA generated the expected protein, but it was recovered entirely in inclusion bodies. Expression as a baculoviral vector in Sf9 cells, however, yielded a soluble protein of the expected molecular mass (∼39 kDa, including His6 and TEV protease recognition site) that could be readily purified to homogeneity by a combination of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and anion exchange HPLC (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the purified protein by gel filtration under non-denaturing conditions revealed that the enzyme is a monomer (Fig. 3). The typical yield of purified protein was 5 mg/15 g of cells.Fig. 3Estimation of the molecular mass of native human PPTase by gel filtration. The standards are amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumen (66 kDa), thioesterase I (32 kDa), malonyl/acetyltransferase (35 kDa), and ACPfas (13 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cloning and Expression of the ACP Domain of the Human Cytosolic FAS—A cDNA encoding the ACP domain of human FAS (ACPfas, residues 2117–2205) was amplified from a human liver cDNA library, cloned into the pQE80 expression plasmid, and its sequence verified. When transfected into E. coli, this cDNA was expressed as a soluble protein (typically 4–8 mg/liter of culture medium) that was readily purified to homogeneity by a combination of nickel ion affinity chromatography and gel filtration (Fig. 2B). Analysis by electrospray mass spectrometry confirmed that, as anticipated, the ACPfas was expressed as the apo form, lacking the phosphopantetheine moiety (Table II). Most of the ACPfas purified as a monomer, but a small portion had a mass corresponding to that of a covalently linked dimer. In the presence"
https://openalex.org/W1972449201,"Smads proteins play a key role in the intracellular signaling of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β family of growth factors, which exhibits a diverse set of cellular responses, including cell proliferation and differentiation. In particular, Smad7 acts as an antagonist of TGF-β signaling, which could determine the intensity or duration of its signaling cascade. In this study we identified a protein inhibitor of activated STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription), PIASy, as a novel interaction partner of Smad7 by yeast two-hybrid screening using the MH2 domain of Smad7 as bait. The association of Smad7 and PIASy was confirmed using co-expressed tagged proteins in 293T cells. Moreover, we found that other Smads including Smad3 also associated with PIASy through its MH2 domain, and PIASy suppressed TGF-β-mediated activation of Smad3. PIASy also stimulated the sumoylation of Smad3 in vivo. Furthermore, endogenous PIASy expression was induced by TGF-β in Hep3B cells. These findings provide the first evidence that a PIAS family protein, PIASy, associates with Smads and involves the regulation of TGF-β signaling using the negative feedback loop.

Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Robert A.B. Pepide Growth Factors and Their Receptor, Part I. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1990: 419-472Google Scholar). These factors regulate growth, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and secretion of important molecules, such as components of the extracellular matrix, adhesion molecules, hormones, and cytokines in a variety of cell types, affecting morphogenesis, tissue repair, tumor suppression, and immunoregulation (1Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Robert A.B. Pepide Growth Factors and Their Receptor, Part I. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1990: 419-472Google Scholar). The TGF-β family also plays important roles in various pathological conditions ranging from abnormal tissue repair state to cancer development (1Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Robert A.B. Pepide Growth Factors and Their Receptor, Part I. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1990: 419-472Google Scholar, 2de Caestecker M.P. Piek E. Roberts A.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1388-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β signaling is mediated through transmembrane receptors located at the cell surface (TβRs) that are serine/threonine kinases, which in turn use the highly conserved members of the Smad (Sma- and MAD-related protein) family of transcription factors to transduce their signals to the nucleus (3Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3984) Google Scholar). Two of the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), Smad2 and Smad3, transduce signals for TGF-β. On the other hand, Smad4 is a common mediator (Co-Smad) and acts as a heterodimeric partner for Smad2 and Smad3 for efficient DNA binding and transcriptional activation (4Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3341) Google Scholar, 5Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H.

When TβRs are activated by the binding of their cognate ligands, Smad 2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by the type I receptor (TβR-I) serine-threonine kinase. Phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 then form stable hetero-complexes with Smad4 that translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription. Inhibitory Smads, such as Smad6 and Smad7, bind activated TβRI, thereby preventing phosphorylation of R-Smads (6Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M.

Transcriptional activation by Smads partly requires the aid of nuclear coactivators such as CBP and p300 (11Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R.

Conversely, transcriptional repression is effected by interaction with nuclear corepressors such as SnoN and c-Ski (13Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K.

These findings indicate that Smad7 regulates intensity and/or duration of TGF-β signaling by interaction with the several molecules, and it could be possible another signaling regulatory molecule(s) may co-operate with Smad7. In attempt to identify novel Smad7 partners, we screened a mouse embryo cDNA library with a yeast two-hybrid system using the MH2 domain of Smad7 as bait. Here, we identify PIASy, which is one of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) family protein, as a protein that interacts specifically with Smad7. They have been originally identified as a cofactor that inhibits the transcriptional activation potential of STAT, and in mammals five PIAS proteins (PIAS1, 3, xα, xβ, and y) have been reported (15Shuai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). PIAS1 and PIAS3 were initially cloned as transcriptional repressors of the Jak-STAT-signaling pathway (16Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 17Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). PIAS3 was originally identified as a specific corepressor of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (17Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). PIAS3 binds to STAT3 and inhibits its DNA binding activity and thereby interferes with STAT3-mediated gene activation. PIAS1, another member of PIAS family, was originally identified as a co-repressor of STAT1 (16Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). PIAS family proteins also function as a transcriptional cofactor for nuclear receptors (18Kotaja N. Aittomaki S. Silvennoinen O. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1986-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Junicho A Matsuda T. Yamamoto T. Kishi H. Korkmaz K. Saatcioglu F. Fuse H. Muraguchi A.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3880-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Recently, PIAS family proteins have been proposed to function as a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-E3 ligase (21Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). PIAS1 and PIASy were shown to catalyze sumoylation of p53 and LEF-1, respectively (22Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 23Nelson V. Davis G.E. Maxwell S.A.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). PIAS family proteins have RING finger-like domain, and their SUMO-E3 ligase activities are dependent on this domain (21Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We find that PIASy interacts with other Smads including Smad3 and antagonizes Smad3-dependent transcriptional activation by TβR-I. Coexpression of PIASy with Smad3 results in the modification of Smad3 with SUMO, suggesting that PIASy functions as a SUMO-E3 ligase for Smad3. We also show that expression of PIASy is induced by TGF-β. Our findings provide additional mechanisms of the negative regulation of TGF-β signaling by PIASy, which may due to the sumoylation of Smad3 by PIASy using the negative feedback loop. Reagents and Antibodies—Human recombinant TGF-β1 was purchased from Strathmann Biotech GmbH (Hamburg, Germany). MG132 was purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Expression vectors, FLAG-tagged Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, Smad6, Smad7, and a series of Smad3 mutants (25Nishihara A. Hanai J.-i. Okamoto N. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Miyazono K. Kawabata M.

Massagué (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY), Dr. H. Ariga, and Dr. T. Taira (Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan), respectively. Anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-FLAG M2 antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-SUMO-1 antibody was purchased from Medical and Biological Laboratories (Nagoya, Japan). Construction of Fusion Proteins with Smad7 or Smad6 MH2 Domain and the Gal 4 DNA Binding Domain—Full-length mouse Smad7 and Smad6 cDNAs were obtained from Dr. K. Miyazono (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan). To generate a bait construct with the MH2 domain of Smad7 and Smad6, PCR was used to amplify the portion of the cDNA encoding amino acid residues 260–427 for Smad7 and residues 331–496 for Smad6 (primer sequences are available upon request). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and inserted into pGBKT7 digested with EcoRI and SalI (downstream of the Gal4 activation domain). All constructs were sequenced to verify the integrity of the constructs. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Gal4-Smad7 MH2 was constructed by fusing the Smad7 (residues 260–427)-coding sequence in-frame to the Gal4 DNA binding domain in the pGBKT7 vector as described the above. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 cells transformed with pGal4-Smad7 MH2 followed by mating with a pretransformed mouse 11-day embryo MATCHMAKER cDNA library in Y187 cells (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), were plated onto media that lacked tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and had been supplemented with 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma). Approximately 3 × 107 colonies were screened for growth in the absence of histidine. Plasmid DNAs derived from positive clones were extracted from yeasts, and sequenced clones were re-introduced into yeast strain AH109 along with either empty pGBKT7, pGBKT7-Smad7 MH2, pGBKT7-Smad6 MH2 (residues 331–496) to verify the Smad/clone interaction. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assays—Human embryonic kidney carcinoma cell line, 293T, was maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS and transfected in DMEM containing 1% FCS by the standard calcium precipitation protocol (28Matsuda T. Yamamoto T. Kishi H. Yoshimura A. Muraguchi A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Human hepatoma cell line Hep3B was maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS (29Yamamoto T. Matsuda T. Muraguchi A. Miyazono K. Kawabata K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Before stimulation, the cells were cultured for 12 h in DMEM containing 1% FCS followed by treatment with TGF-β (30Xu G. Chakraborty C Lala P.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 31Wang L.H. Yang X.Y. Mihalic K. Xiao W. Li D. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31839-31844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Hep3B cells (2–2.5 × 105 in a 6-cm dish) were transfected by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase assay was performed as described (28Matsuda T. Yamamoto T. Kishi H. Yoshimura A. Muraguchi A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, lysed in 100 μl of PicaGene Reporter Lysis Buffer (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan), and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activities were normalized to the β-galactosidase activities. Three or more independent experiments were carried out for each assay. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—The immunoprecipitation and Western blotting assays were performed as described previously (28Matsuda T. Yamamoto T. Kishi H. Yoshimura A. Muraguchi A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin). The immunoprecipitates from cell lysates were resolved on 5–20% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon filter (Millipore; Bedford, MA). The filters were then immunoblotted with each antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Sumoylation Assay—Human 293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated vectors, and 36 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) for 4 h to inhibit proteasomal degradation of Smad3. Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm MG132, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin). Western blotting was performed as described the above. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Monkey COS7 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS transfected with FLAG-Smad3 and Myc-tagged PIASy together with TβR-I(T204D) by the calcium phosphate precipitation protocol. 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed with a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and reacted with a mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) or with a rabbit anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz). The cells were then reacted with an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (CHEMICON, Temecula, CA) and observed under a confocal laser fluorescent microscope. Northern Blot and RT-PCR Analysis—After 12 h of incubation in 1% FCS, Hep3B cells were treated with TGF-β (100units/ml) for the indicated time. Total RNAs were prepared by using Iso-Gen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) and used in Northern analysis according to the established procedures (29Yamamoto T. Matsuda T. Muraguchi A. Miyazono K. Kawabata K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences) and radiolabeled cDNA probes were used where indicated. RT-PCR was performed using a RT-PCR high Plus-Kit (TOYOBO, Tokyo, Japan). Human PIAS3 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers were used as described previously (30Xu G. Chakraborty C Lala P.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 31Wang L.H. Yang X.Y. Mihalic K. Xiao W. Li D. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31839-31844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Identification of PIASy as an Interaction Partner of Smads—To identify proteins that could be involved in the negative regulation of TGF-β signaling, we screened a mouse 11-day embryo cDNA library using the MH2 domain of mouse Smad7 as bait. Several Smad7 MH2-interacting proteins were identified from a screening of ∼3 × 107 yeast transformants. DNA sequencing analysis revealed that one of the positive clones that interacted specifically with Gal4 DNA binding domain-fused Smad7 MH2 was identical with a member of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT family PIASy that contains a 144-amino acid insertion (residue 1–144) in the N-terminal region. To demonstrate specificity of binding, the plasmid was isolated from the positive two-hybrid clone and introduced back into S. cerevisiae along with either Smad7 MH2 domain or Smad6 MH2 domain fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 or empty vector (Gal4 DNA binding domain alone). Neither Smad7 MH2 domain nor Smad6 MH2 domain resulted in activation of the reporter genes (data not shown). After mating the indicated yeast, growth occurs only in the presence of either Smad7 MH2 or Smad6 MH2 (Fig. 1A), demonstrating that PIASy interacted with the MH2 domain of both Smad7 and Smad6 in this assay. To investigate the association of PIASy with other Smads including Smad7 in vivo, 293T cells were transfected with either FLAG-tagged Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, Smad6, or Smad7 together with Myc-tagged PIASy. As shown in Fig. 1B, comparable amounts of Smads were expressed in each cell lysate. Similarly, PIASy was expressed well in samples containing Smads. Western blot analysis of associated proteins with an anti-FLAG antibody revealed that PIASy interacts with all Smads in 293T cells, although the PIASy-Smad4 interaction was weak. As shown in Fig 1A, the MH2 domain of the inhibitory Smad, Smad6, and Smad7 interacted with PIASy. We then examined whether PIASy interacts with Smad3 via the similar domain using either N- or C-terminal deletion mutants of Smad3 (25Nishihara A. Hanai J.-i. Okamoto N. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4A). Expression vectors encoding Myc-tagged PIASy and/or FLAG-tagged full-length Smad3 or one of its four deletion mutants were transiently transfected into 293T cells. Cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-Myc antibody. Immunoprecipitates were then used in Western blot analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, whereas the full-length Smad3 interacted with PIASy, the C-terminal deletion mutants lacking the MH2 or L+MH2 domains were unable to bind PIASy In contrast, the N-terminal mutants in which MH1 or MH1+L domains are deleted retained interactions with PIASy. These results indicate that efficient PIASy-Smad3 interactions require the MH2 domain of Smad3. Colocalization of PIASy and Smad3—To determine the subcellular localization of PIASy and activated Smad3, expression vectors for Myc-tagged PIASy and FLAG-tagged Smad3 together with a constitutively active form of TGF-β type I receptor, TβR-I(T204D), which activates Smad3, were transfected into COS7 cells. Co-expression of TβR-I(T204D) together with Smad3 in COS7 cells resulted in a maximal Smad3-mediated transcription (data not shown). 48 h after transfection, the cells were stained with anti-Myc and anti-FLAG antibodies, and they were visualized with rhodamine and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively, under a confocal laser microscope (Fig. 2, A–C). Smad3 is previously shown to tend to translocate spontaneously into nucleus and observed as a diffuse pattern in cells (32Xu L. Chen Y.-G. Massagué J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 33Zhang Y. Musci T. Derynck R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Active Smad3 was localized mainly in the nucleus with a slightly diffuse pattern (Fig. 2A). In the previous study PIASy was shown to localize predominantly to punctate structures in the nucleus (21Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, PIASy was tightly localized to punctate structures in the nucleus. Our results also showed that both PIASy and a portion of activated Smad3 were located in the nucleus, and they were found to be co-localized in a characteristic nuclear dot structure after demonstration of the merged figure, in which the red and green colors turned yellow (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that both activated Smad3 and PIASy co-localize in the nucleus within dotted structures. Repression of TGF-β Signaling by PIASy—To examine the functional relevance of the Smads/PIASy interaction in the context of TGF-β signaling pathway, we performed the transient transfection assay using a human embryonic kidney carcinoma cell line, 293T. The TGF-β-mediated transcriptional responses were measured by p3TP-LUC, which is one of the standard reporters for assessing TGF-β activity (26Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments a constitutively active form of TGF-β type I receptor, TβR-I(T204D) (26Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used that stimulated p3TP-LUC more effectively than TGF-β plus wild-type TβR-I in 293T cells (31Wang L.H. Yang X.Y. Mihalic K. Xiao W. Li D. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31839-31844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). When 293T cells were transfected with p3TP-LUC together with an expression vector for TβR-I(T204D), LUC expression was increased by 5–6-fold (Fig. 3A). The additional expression of Smad3 enhanced p3TP-LUC activity, whereas additional expression of Smad7 inhibited p3TP-LUC in a dose-dependent manner. We then examined the effect of PIASy expression on TGF-β signaling in this model system. When 293T cells were transfected with an expression vector for PIASy, TβR-I(T204D)/Smad3, and p3TP-LUC, PIASy dramatically suppressed TβR-I(T204D)/Smad3-induced p3TP-LUC activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and B). The Smad7-mediated suppression of TβR-I(T204D)-induced p3TP-LUC activity was further stimulated by PIASy expression, which was reversed by the additional Smad3 expression (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the inhibitory effects of PIASy on TβR-I(T204D)-induced transcriptional activity is mediated by the direct interaction between PIASy and Smad3. Furthermore, expression of PIASXα, another member of the PIAS family, had no effect on TβR-I(T204D)/Smad3-induced p3TP-LUC activity (Fig. 3D). We then tested the domain(s) of Smad3 that is involved in the inhibition of TGF-β signaling by PIASy. As shown in Fig. 3E, expression of PIASy significantly reduced TβR-I(T204D)/ Smad3-induced p3TP-LUC activation. Expression of the N-terminal deletion mutants of Smad3, but not the C-terminal deletion mutants of Smad3 lacking the MH2 domain, largely reversed the PIASy-mediated inhibition of p3TP-LUC expression. These results also suggest that the MH2 domain of Smad3 mediates the inhibition of TGF-β signaling by PIASy. PIASy Mediates SUMO-1 Modification of Smad3—One of the possible mechanisms that is consistent with the data described above is that there is post-translation modification or degradation of Smad3. To test the possibility of whether PIASy-mediated inhibition of TβR-I(T204D)/Smad3-induced p3TP-LUC activation was regulated through a specific proteolytic pathway, the proteasome-specific inhibitor MG132 was added to transfected cells at concentrations of 5 and 20 μm for 16 h. Interestingly, the results show that the proteasome-specific inhibitor MG132 could block PIASy-mediated inhibition of TβR-I(T204D)/Smad3-induced p3TP-LUC activation (Fig. 4A). In previous studies, PIASy were shown to catalyze sumoylation of p53 and LEF-1 as SUMO E3 ligase and modify their transcriptional activation (22Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 23Nelson V. Davis G.E. Maxwell S.A. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Sachdev S. Bruhn L. Sieber H. Pichler A. Melchior F. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). To examine whether PIASy stimulates SUMO modification of Smad3, we transiently expressed FLAG-tagged Smad3, SUMO-1, and Myc-tagged PIASy in 293T cells. The cell extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitates produced were probed by Western blotting with anti-SUMO-1or anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4B). A strong band with slower mobility than that of intact Smad3 was detected by anti-SUMO-1 antibody in the case of co-transfection with Smad3, SUMO-1, and PIASy expression vectors. These results suggest that Smad3 is conjugated with SUMO-1, the conjugation being mediated by PIASy. However, we could not detect any significant decrease in Smad3 content when we expressed both Smad3 and PIASy in 293T cells (Fig. 4B). This may suggest that other factors in a MG132-sensitive proteasome pathway like Smad7-associated Smurfs (9Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12477-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 10Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar) are also involved in PIASy-mediated inhibition of TβR-I(T204D)/Smad3-dependent transcription. PIASy Inhibits TGF-β-induced Smad3 Activation in Hep3B Cells—To examine the effect of PIASy on the TGF-β-signaling pathway under more physiological conditions through endogenous proteins, we first utilized a TGF-β-responsive, human hepatoma cell line Hep3B (30Xu G. Chakraborty C Lala P.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the transient transfection assay. Hep3B cells were transfected with p3TP-LUC together with empty vector or PIASy and treated with TGF-β, and LUC activities were determined. As shown in Fig. 5A, PIASy expression showed a significant decrease of TGF-β-stimulated p3TP-LUC activation in Hep3B cells. We next examined whether PIASy expression is regulated by TGF-β in Hep3B cells. Cells were either left untreated or treated with TGF-β, and PIASy expression was monitored by Northern analysis. Interestingly, PIASy expression was remarkably induced by treatment of TGF-β in Hep3B cells (Fig. 5B). The level of PIASy mRNA expression increased 6-fold at 6 h and 8-fold at 12 h and did not alter until 24 h. When we monitored the same RNA samples by RT-PCR, TGF-β treatment induced Smad3-mediated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression, although the expression level of PIAS3 was not changed by TGF-β stimulation. These results demonstrated that expression of PIASy but not PIAS3 is induced by TGF-β and affects its signaling in Hep3B cells. However, the almost maximal PAI-1 expression by TGF-β was detected at 3 h, although a strong PIASy expression by TGF-β was detected at 6 h, suggesting that PIASy may be involved in the late phase regulation or longer term refractoriness in response to TGF-β. Furthermore, we tested the effect of PIASy on endogenous PAI-1 expression by TGF-β. Hep3B cells were transfected with empty vector or PIASy and treated with TGF-β, and PAI-1 expression was monitored by PT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 5C, when cells were transfected with PIASy, endogenous PAI-1 expression was decreased by 50% compared with that of empty vector. These results suggest that PIASy is induced by TGF-β and inhibits TGF-β/Smad3-mediated gene expression in Hep3B cells. Dysregulation of the TGF-β signaling have been associated with a variety of clinical disorders including some cancers, renal disease, and vascular disease (2de Caestecker M.P. Piek E. Roberts A.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1388-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Border W.A. Noble N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). Although mutations in various components of the TGF-β pathway may account for some of these abnormalities, it has been shown that TGF-β signaling can be strongly affected by interactions with other molecules in the cell. Recent studies have documented the interaction of a large number of intracellular proteins with the effector molecule Smads to influence TGF-β signaling (35Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Whereas some of these proteins have been found to functionally cooperate with and activate Smads, others were found to repress Smad activity. Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed for the inactivation of Smad/TGF-β signaling pathway. For example, TGF-β signaling is inhibited by IFN-γ (36Ulloa L. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) and TNF-β (37Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Bottinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar), which induce the expression of an inhibitory Smad, Smad7. In addition, the zinc finger protein Evi-1 interacts with Smad3 and represses its DNA binding activity (38Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), whereas the nuclear Ski and SnoN oncoproteins have been reported to inhibit TGF-β signaling by recruitment of the transcriptional repressor N-CoR to TGF-β-responsive promoters through interaction with Smad proteins (13Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K. Science. 1999; 286: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 39Akiyoshi S. Inoue H. Hanai J. Kusanagi K. Nemoto N. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 12442-12447Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Smad2/3 interacts with Ski through its C-terminal MH2 domain in a TGF-β-dependent manner. We also demonstrated that estrogen receptors suppress TGF-β signaling by associating with and acting as a transcriptional co-repressor for Smad3 (42Matsuda T. Yamamoto T. Muraguchi A. Saatcioglu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42907-42914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin ligases Smurf1 and Smurf2 bind to Smad7 and are recruited to the activated TβR-I by Smad7, leading to proteasomal degradation of the receptor (9Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T.

Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Another protein called STRAP, originally identified as a TβRI-interacting protein, also associates with Smad7 (43Datta P.K. Moses H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). STRAP recruits Smad7 to activated TβR-I and stabilizes the Smad7-TβR-I association, preventing R-Smad phosphorylation by TβR-I and subsequent intracellular signaling. A recently identified Smad7-interacting protein, Yes-associated protein YAP65, functions as an inhibitor of TGF-β signaling in a manner similar to that of STRAP (44Ferrigno O. Lallemand F. Verrecchia F. L'Hoste S. Camonis J. Atfi A. Mauviel A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4879-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). SUMO modification proceeds by a three-step enzyme shuttle analogous to ubiquitin addition (45Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). For ubiquitin, an ATP-dependent activation step couples ubiquitin by a thioester bond to the E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme. In turn, ubiquitin is transferred to the reactive cysteine of one of several E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Typically, an E3 ubiquitin ligase combines with the charged E2 to facilitate formation of an isopeptide bond between ubiquitin and the target protein (21Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). E3s typically use protein-protein interaction domains to bind to and select specific targets and either a zinc binding RING finger domain or a HECT domain to stimulate polyubiquitin chain formation. Recently, four members of the mammalian PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) family, PIAS1, PIASx, PIASx, and PIASy, and a yeast PIAS homologue, Siz1, have been reported to have SUMO-E3 ligase activities toward various target proteins, including p53 and LEF1, and affect their transcriptional activity (21Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 22Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that one of PIAS family proteins, PIASy, interacts with other Smads including Smad3 and antagonizes Smad3-dependent transcriptional activation by TβR-I. Coexpression of PIASy with Smad3 results in the modification of Smad3 with SUMO-1, suggesting that PIASy functions as a SUMO-E3 ligase for Smad3. Recent studies showed that Smad4 but not Smad1 and Smad3 associates with Ubc9 and is modified by SUMO-1 (41Moren A. Hellman U. Inada Y. Imamura T. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. J. Biol.

Interestingly, sumoylation of Smad4 resulted in the activation of TGF-β signaling, suggesting sumoylation might modulate TGF-β signaling positively or negatively in cells (41Moren A. Hellman U.

Our findings provide a novel mechanism of the negative regulation of TGF-β signaling by PIASy, which may be due to the sumoylation of Smad3 by PIASy using the negative feedback loop. More detailed understanding of the cross-talk between Smads and PIASy is, therefore, important as this new information may provide new therapeutic approaches for the TGF-β-mediated pathological conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2040051991,"Clones for a novel transmembrane receptor termed FGFRL1 were isolated from a subtracted, cartilage-specific cDNA library prepared from chicken sterna. Homologous sequences were identified in other vertebrates, including man, mouse, rat and fish, but not in invertebrates such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila. FGFRL1 was expressed preferentially in skeletal tissues as demonstrated by Northern blotting and in situ hybridization. Small amounts of the FGFRL1 mRNA were also detected in other tissues such as skeletal muscle and heart. The novel protein contained three extracellular Ig-like domains that were related to the members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor family. However, it lacked the intracellular protein tyrosine kinase domain required for signal transduction by transphosphorylation. When expressed in cultured cells as a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein, FGFRL1 was specifically localized to the plasma membrane where it might interact with FGF ligands. Recombinant FGFRL1 protein was produced in a baculovirus system with intact disulfide bonds. Similar to FGF receptors, the expressed protein interacted specifically with heparin and with FGF2. When overexpressed in MG-63 osteosarcoma cells, the novel receptor had a negative effect on cell proliferation. Taken together our data are consistent with the view that FGFRL1 acts as a decoy receptor for FGF ligands.

Taken together our data are consistent with the view that FGFRL1 acts as a decoy receptor for FGF ligands. Most bones of the vertebrate skeleton are formed by a complex process termed endochondral ossification which involves a cartilage intermediate (1Bianco P. Descalzi Cancedda F. Riminucci M. Cancedda R. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This intermediate represents a highly specialized connective tissue. It consists of a single cell type, the chondrocytes, which are embedded in a rich extracellular matrix (2Heinegard D. Oldberg A. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2042-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Typically, this matrix makes up more than 90% of the cartilage volume and consists of collagens (types II, IX, X, and XI), proteoglycans (aggrecan, small leucine-rich proteins), and glycoproteins (matrilins, COMP). During the first step of endochondral ossification, mesenchymal cells condense and differentiate into chondrocytes (3Cancedda R. Descalzi Cancedda F. Castagnola P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 159: 265-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These chondrocytes proliferate rapidly and lay down the cartilaginous model of the future bones. The chondrocytes undergo a complex series of distinct developmental stages, including proliferation, maturation, and hypertrophy. The hypertrophic cartilage is calcified and becomes vascularized. Finally, the calcified cartilage is invaded by osteoclasts and osteoblasts, which replace the cartilaginous tissue by bone. Cartilage has become a popular tissue to study cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro (3Cancedda R. Descalzi Cancedda F. Castagnola P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 159: 265-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). When cultivated on plastic dishes, chondrocytes rapidly dedifferentiate into fibroblast-like cells. In three-dimensional lattices, however, the chondrocytes undergo the ordered sequence of events observed during differentiation and maturation of cartilage in vivo. Three stages of chondrocyte differentiation have been defined in vitro: proliferative chondrocytes producing mainly collagen II, hypertrophic chondrocytes producing collagen X, and osteoblast-like cells producing collagen I and alkaline phosphatase. Many vitamins, hormones, and growth factors are involved in the regulation of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation (4Vortkamp A. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: S109-S117PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms, how these substances act on gene expression, however, are not yet understood in detail. Vitamin D3, ascorbic acid, and retinoic acid as well as the growth factors FGF, 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; FGFRL, fibroblast growth factor receptor-like; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IL-1, interleukin-1; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β. TGF-β, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) play critical roles during endochondral ossification. Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and the parathyroid-hormone related peptide (PTHrP) constitute a paracrine feedback loop that regulates differentiation of proliferative chondrocytes into hypertrophic cells in the growth plate of long bones. At the level of gene expression, the transcription factors Sox9, L-Sox5, and Sox6 play an important role in the determination of the cartilage cell lineage (5de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. Nikashima K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In particular Sox9 appears to act as a key differentiation factor for chondrocytes analogous to the way that MyoD acts as a master gene during muscle differentiation. We have recently set out to identify and characterize novel cartilage proteins by a subtractive cDNA cloning approach (6Belluoccio D. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Belluoccio D. Schenker T. Baici A. Trueb B. Genomics. 1998; 53: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Special emphasis was put on regulatory proteins that might play a role during chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. Two cDNA libraries were constructed with mRNA from cartilage and subtracted with mRNA from skin or skeletal muscle. These libraries comprised many clones for known cartilage-specific proteins. In addition, our libraries contained several novel clones whose sequences have not yet been stored in public data banks. Some of the novel clones coded for a structural protein that was highly related to the family of the matrilins (6Belluoccio D. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Belluoccio D. Schenker T. Baici A. Trueb B. Genomics. 1998; 53: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Another set of clones was found to code for a novel transmembrane protein related to members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family. Here we describe the characterization of this novel membrane protein and demonstrate that it represents a new player in the FGF signaling system. RNA Extraction and Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated from various sources by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (8Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) utilizing the RNeasy kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). When the RNA was prepared from cultured cells, the cell lysate was passed through a Qiashredder as suggested by the supplier (Qiagen); when the RNA was prepared from embryonic or adult tissues, the samples were homogenized in lysis buffer and extracted once with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform. Following isolation on RNeasy columns, the purified RNA was resolved on 1% agarose gels in the presence of 1% formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes by vacuum blotting. Radioactively labeled cDNA probes were hybridized at 42 °C to the membranes in a buffer containing 50% formamide as described (9Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1987Google Scholar, 10Schenker T. Trueb B. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Following stringent washing, the membranes were exposed to x-ray film. Subtracted cDNA Libraries—Poly(A) RNA was purified from total RNA by chromatography on oligo(dT)-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Two subtracted cDNA libraries were constructed by the biotin/streptavidin/phenol method (10Schenker T. Trueb B. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Duguid J.R. Dinauer M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2789-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In brief, the poly(A) RNA isolated from embryonic chicken sterna and from embryonic chicken control tissues (skin and skeletal muscle) was transcribed separately into double stranded cDNA and provided with specific adapters. An adapter with an internal SalI restriction site was used for the cDNA from sterna, whereas a biotinylated adapter without restriction site was used for the cDNA from the control tissues. The cDNAs were amplified by PCR with primers designed according to the adapter sequences. The cDNA preparation from sterna was then hybridized overnight at 68 °C with a 10-fold excess of biotinylated cDNAs from the control tissues. All hybrids containing at least one biotinylated strand were removed by extraction with phenol in the presence of streptavidin. After a second round of hybridization and extraction, the material remaining in the aqueous phase was amplified by PCR to replenish the cDNAs from cartilage. The entire procedure was repeated a total of three times and then the products were ligated into the SalI restriction site of the cloning vector pUC13. The plasmids were transfected into competent bacteria and plated onto selective agar plates. The inserts from clones of interest were radioactively labeled and used as probes to screen a conventional cDNA library, which had been generated from the cartilage of embryonic chicken sterna (6Belluoccio D. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1987Google Scholar). The DNA sequences of the inserts were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method. All sequences were analyzed with the software computer package of the genetics computer group at the University of Wisconsin. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization studies were performed essentially as described (9Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1987Google Scholar, 12Wälchli C. Koch M. Chiquet M. Odermatt B.F. Trueb B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 669-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) utilizing labeled RNA probes. Samples from 17-day-old mouse embryos were embedded in paraffin and cut into serial sections. Riboprobes were transcribed from the mouse FGFRL1 cDNA sequence (nucleotides 661–1417), which had been cloned into the vector pSK+, with RNA polymerase T7 (antisense) or T3 (sense) in the presence of 35S-uridine 5′-triphosphate. The probes were purified by gel filtration and separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel to confirm size and purity. The tissue sections were digested with proteinase K and hybridized with the probes at a concentration of ∼5 × 107 dpm/ml for 18 h at 60 °C. Following hybridization, the slides were treated with RNase A and washed in 0.1 × standard saline citrate at 65 °C for 2 h. The slides were then coated with NTB-2 emulsion, exposed for 3 days at 4 °C, and developed with d-19 developer and fixer (Eastman Kodak Co.). Following staining with hematoxilin and eosin, the slides were inspected under a Nikon Eclipse E1000 microscope equipped with dark field optics. Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Fusion Protein Expression—MG-63 and COS-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were grown under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 9% fetal bovine serum. The cDNA sequence of mouse FGFRL1 corresponding to amino acid residues 1–468 was subcloned into the SacI/BamHI restriction site of the GFP expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). Likewise, the sequence for the intracellular domain (residues 493–end) was ligated into the HindIII/KpnI site of the expression vector pEGFP-C3. The reading frame of the resulting constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmids (1 μg/well) were mixed with Opti-MEM 1 (Invitrogen) containing 3 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics) and added to cultivated cells that were growing on circular cover slips placed into 6 well plates (13Li B. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33328-33335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One and 2 days after transfection, the slides were inspected under a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope. Analogous experiments were also performed with the human FGFRL1 sequence. Protein Expression in Insect Cells—The extracellular portion of the human and the chicken FGFRL1 protein was expressed in insect cells utilizing the BacVector transfection kit from Novagen. The cDNA sequences corresponding to amino acid residues 25–355 of the chicken or 36–368 of the human protein were ligated into the EcoRI/HindIII or BamHI/SacI restriction site, respectively, of the transfer plasmid pBAC-3. This transfer plasmid harbors the polyhedrin promoter and the sequence for the signal peptide of the baculovirus envelope protein gp64 to direct expression of proteins into the secretory pathway of infected insect cells. Furthermore, the fusion protein is expressed together with a His-tag that allows the purification of the recombinant protein on nickel affinity columns. Authenticity and reading frame of the resulting constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The transfer plasmids (500 ng) were transfected together with the BacVector-3000 Triple Cut virus DNA (100 ng) into Sf9 cells that had been cultivated in Grace medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 9% fetal bovine serum. Three days after transfection, viral particles of the supernatant were purified to homogeneity by the agarose overlay technique and amplified to a viral titer >107/ml. Recombinant protein was produced by infection of fresh Sf9 cells growing in 75-cm2 flasks with this viral stock utilizing a multiplicity of 1–4 plaque forming units/cell. Two days after infection, the supernatant of the insect cells was harvested, and the expressed proteins were purified by chromatography on nickel agarose (HIS-select HC nickel affinity gel, Sigma) and/or heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as suggested by the supplier. Interactions of the Recombinant Protein—Recombinant protein (50 μg) was loaded onto a small heparin-Sepharose column (bed volume: 0.5 ml, Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. The column was extensively washed with the same buffer, and bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15–1.35 m NaCl in a total volume of 22 ml. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and checked for their NaCl concentration by measuring the conductivity with a WTW LF330 conductivity meter (Weilheim, Germany). Aliquots (32 μl) from every third fraction were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and detected by immunoblotting with an antibody directed against the His-tag of the expressed protein. To test for a potential interaction with FGF, human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor was radiolabeled to a specific activity of 900 Ci/mmol (100 μCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences) using 125I and chloramine T. Aliquots of the expressed protein (5 μg) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 2.5 μl of labeled FGF2 and 25 μl of nickelagarose (Sigma) in 1 ml of 300 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. In some experiments, the binding reaction was competed with 5 μg of recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (Roche Applied Science) or with 10 μl of fetal bovine serum. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of 300 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. Bound proteins were eluted with 40 μl of hot SDS sample buffer containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol and analyzed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. Cell Proliferation Assay—A cell proliferation assay kit from Roche Applied Science was used to analyze the effect of FGFRL1 on cell growth. MG-63 cells were grown on cover slips to 30% confluence. The cDNA sequences for chicken and mouse FGFRL1 were ligated into the eukaryotic expression vectors pcDNA3.1(+) and pcDNA3.1(–) and transfected into the cells as described above. Following transfection, the cells were synchronized by starvation in medium lacking any fetal bovine serum. After 24 h the cells were stimulated to proliferate again by the addition of insulin (0.5 μg/ml), FGF2 (5 ng/ml), and heparin (300 ng/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 18 h, the cells were labeled with bromodeoxyuridine and fixed with cold glycine-ethanol buffer as described by the supplier of the kit. Proliferating cells were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence utilizing a monoclonal anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody and a secondary, fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse Ig antibody. Cell growth was determined by counting immunoreactive cells in relation to the total cell number. Cloning of Chicken FGFRL1—Our cDNA libraries that had been constructed with mRNA from chicken cartilage and subtracted with mRNA from chicken skin and muscle comprised more than 500 clones. About 300 individual clones were analyzed with respect to their insert size (200–600 bp), their DNA sequence, and their hybridization pattern. One-third of these clones showed the expected behavior on a Northern blot: they were expressed in sternal cartilage but not in skeletal muscle (Fig. 1). A high redundancy was observed as the majority of the latter clones coded for type II collagen, the predominant collagen of cartilage. The remaining cartilage-specific clones coded for type IX collagen, type XI collagen, aggrecan, link protein, chondromodulin, and matrilin-3 (Fig. 1). Finally, seven clones were found to code for short fragments of a novel protein. The novel clones were utilized as probes to identify overlapping clones in a conventional cDNA library prepared from chicken cartilage. Our efforts led to the isolation of 14 cDNA clones that altogether spanned a cDNA of 6175 nucleotides (GenBank™ accession number AJ535114). This cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1461 nucleotides that could be translated into a novel protein of 487 amino acids with a molecular mass of 54,000 Da. Utilizing the information of the chicken sequence and various expressed sequence tags, we were able to clone the homologous proteins from man (GenBank™ accession number AJ277437), mouse (GenBank™ accession number AJ293947), and rat (GenBank™ accession number AJ536020). The sequences for the human and the mouse protein have already been published as short sequence papers (14Wiedemann M. Trueb B. Genomics. 2000; 69: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Wiedemann M. Trueb B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1520: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A strong conservation of the amino acids was observed when the four protein sequences were compared (Fig. 2). The chicken amino acid sequence shared 74% sequence identity (81% sequence similarity if conservative amino acid replacements were included) with the human and 72% identity (78% similarity) with the rat sequence. The mouse sequence differed from the rat sequence only at 11 positions (not shown). Computer predictions revealed that the novel protein represented a typical membrane protein that was highly related to the members of the FGF receptor family. We therefore termed the novel protein fibroblast growth factor receptor-like protein (approved gene symbol FGFRL1). Similar to the four members of the FGF receptor family (16Szebenyi G. Fallon J.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 185: 45-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the novel chicken protein contained a signal peptide and a single membrane-spanning domain as well as three extracellular Ig-like repeats. Each of these repeats possessed two conserved cysteine residues that may be involved in the formation of a disulfide bridge. The three Ig-loops of the chicken FGFRL1 protein shared 39–48% sequence similarity with the extracellular domain of chicken FGFR3 (CEK2). At the intracellular side, the novel protein differed completely from all members of the FGF receptor family. FGFR1–4 are known to contain a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase domain that plays an important role in signal transduction (16Szebenyi G. Fallon J.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 185: 45-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ornitz D.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). This kinase domain was completely missing in the novel protein. Instead, FGFRL1 contained a short cytoplasmic tail of about 100 amino acids. This cytoplasmic tail showed a much lower degree of conservation among the four species examined than the extracellular domain with the exception of a histidinerich stretch at the C terminus (Fig. 2). This stretch revealed some similarity to the histidine-rich region of homeodomain proteins. FGFRL1 during Evolution—A peculiar observation was made with the murine FGFRL1 sequences. Compared with the chicken and the human sequences, the rat sequence diverged in the intracellular, histidine-rich region at residue 475 and stopped after 54 unrelated residues (Fig. 2). If a single nucleotide would be deleted at this position, the reading frame would change to a highly similar sequence that would end after 21 residues with the motif Y-Q-C as found in the chicken and the human protein. Nevertheless, the frameshift is real, since it was confirmed in the mouse sequence. It is therefore likely that the murine FGFRL1 genes have sustained a frameshift mutation relatively late during evolution. The complete genomic sequences of several organisms have recently been elucidated and deposited in public data banks. We therefore checked whether other species may also contain a receptor similar to FGFRL1. Neither the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster nor the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans possessed any gene that would give rise to a transmembrane protein with three related Ig-like repeats. A similar sequence, however, was identified in the genome of the pufferfish Fugu rubripes. This fish contained a gene with six exons that could be transcribed into a mRNA of ∼3000 nucleotides and translated into a protein of ∼500 residues (Fig. 2). The putative fish protein shared 67–73% sequence identity with FGFRL1 from chicken, rat and man. It should be noted that the fish sequence also ended with the peculiar histidine-rich region and the motif Y-Q-C as the human and the chicken sequence. Thus, vertebrates from fish to man contain a novel, homologous protein that belongs to the FGFR family. Lower animals, including insects and nematodes, do not appear to possess this protein. Expression of FGFRL1—The expression of FGFRL1 was analyzed on Northern blots containing RNA from various chicken tissues (Fig. 3). Two bands of similar intensities corresponding to mRNA species of 7 and 4 kb were detected. The size of the larger band is consistent with the total length of our cDNA sequence. The shorter band might represent a mRNA species that was generated by utilization of an alternative polyadenylation site at position 3416 of our cDNA sequence. This notion is consistent with the fact that a radioactively labeled probe derived from the very 3′ end of the total cDNA sequence hybridized with the 7-kb mRNA species but not with the 5-kb species (not shown). The two mRNA species were detected in RNA preparations from the cartilaginous sterna of 16-day-old chicken embryos (Fig. 3, left). Very faint bands that became clearly visible after prolonged exposure were also noticed with RNA preparations from embryonic femur, skeletal muscle, and heart. In contrast, RNA preparations from skin, gizzard, liver, and brain did not reveal any signal. Fairly strong bands were also detected with RNA preparations from adult chicken sterna (Fig. 3, right). In this case, the signal obtained with the cranial portion of the sternum, which is known to contain many hypertrophic chondrocytes in a mineralized matrix, barely differed from that of the caudal portion, which contains proliferative and resting chondrocytes in a non-mineralized matrix. All the other tissues investigated from the adult animal (brain, gizzard, skeletal muscle, calvaria) revealed faint bands that became clearly visible after prolonged exposure. Thus, the FGFRL1 gene is expressed at fairly high level in cartilage and at very low level in many other tissues. Tissue Distribution—The tissue distribution of the FGFRL1 mRNA was further investigated by in situ hybridization on whole body sections of 17-day-old mouse embryos (Fig. 4). Our antisense probe hybridized specifically with a mRNA in all cartilaginous structures. A relatively strong signal was observed in the nasal cartilage, the ribs, and the sternum as well as in the cartilaginous rudiments of developing bones such as the vertebrae and the pelvic bone. Strong expression was also observed in some muscular tissues, including the muscles of the tongue and the diaphragm. In contrast, no signal was detected in the eye, the brain, and the spinal cord. Moreover, the lung and most of the inner organs, including liver, stomach, intestine, and colon, showed very low signal. Hybridization of a consecutive tissue section with our sense probe showed very low background signal, demonstrating the specificity of our probe (Fig. 4). The cartilaginous vertebrae of a 17-day-old embryo was investigated in greater detail (Fig. 5). Relatively strong expression of FGFRL1 mRNA was observed in the developing vertebral bodies. No differences were noted between the cranial and the caudal portion of the vertebrae. Regions of mineralizing cartilage containing hypertrophic cells showed substantially reduced signal. Likewise, the nucleus pulposus that would later give rise to the intervertebral disc revealed only a weak signal. All the tissues adjacent to the vertebrae, including the spinal cord at the dorsal part and the inner organs at the ventral part, reacted only weakly with our probe. Nevertheless, the signal at these locations appeared to be slightly stronger than the background observed with the sense probe (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with the view that FGFRL1 is expressed at fairly high level in all cartilaginous tissues of the skeleton as well as in a few specialized muscles and at very low level in several other tissues. Subcellular Localization—As a receptor for growth factors, the FGFRL1 protein should be located at the plasma membrane. To study the subcellular distribution, we fused the cDNA sequence for mouse and human FGFRL1 to the sequence for GFP and transfected the resulting constructs into human (MG-63) and monkey (COS-1) cells. When inspected by confocal microscopy, the majority of the signal emitted from GFP was found to be distributed along the plasma membrane (Fig. 6). Some signal could also be detected at compartments of the secretory pathway (Golgi, secretory vesicles), but virtually no signal was detected in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Thus, the novel receptor is faithfully expressed from our constructs and inserted into the plasma membrane where it could theoretically interact with ligands. A similar experiment was performed with the cytoplasmic portion of the FGFRL1 protein fused to GFP. After transfection of the corresponding construct into MG-63 or COS-1 cells, the fusion protein was found to be distributed all over the cytoplasm and the nucleus in a very diffuse fashion (not shown). The distribution could not be distinguished from that obtained with cells that had been transfected with a construct for GFP alone. Thus, the cytoplasmic tail of the FGFRL1 protein does not appear to interact with proteins of any specific subcellular site. Interactions of the FGFRL1 Protein—To investigate a possible interaction of FGFRL1 with putative ligands, chemical amounts of the FGFRL1 protein were required. We therefore placed the chicken and the human cDNA sequence into a prokaryotic expression vector and expressed the extracellular domain of FGFRL1 as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli. Although we were able to isolate high amounts of fusion proteins from inclusion bodies, the purified proteins did not fold in a correct way as demonstrated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the absence of reducing agents, the proteins formed large aggregates linked by disulfide bo"

https://openalex.org/W2029524330,"Histone modification through acetylation and deacetylation is a key process in transcription, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation. During mitosis, histones are highly acetylated and chromatin is condensed. Here, we investigate the mechanistic involvement of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in the regulation of mitotic checkpoint activation. Inhibition of HDAC activity was found to cause the improper kinetochore localization of the mitotic checkpoint proteins, and to prolong mitotic arrest, and thus to lead to chromosomal instability due to aberrant exit from the mitotic cell cycle arrest. In addition, treatment with HDAC inhibitor attenuated the activations of p38 and ERK kinases, and increased the expression levels of cIAP-1, suggesting that the observed increased adaptation and chromosomal instability induced by inhibiting HDAC activity might be directly connected with the activations of cell survival and/or antiapoptotic signals. Moreover, the treatment of cells with mitotic defects with HDAC inhibitor increased their susceptibility to chromosomal instability. These results support the notion that HDAC activity plays an important role in the regulation of mitotic checkpoint activation, and thus the aberrant control of HDAC activity contributes to chromosomal instability."

In the lysosomal sphingolipid degradation pathway, acid β-glucosidase (GCase) requires saposin C for optimal in vitro and in vivo hydrolysis of glucocerebroside. The deficiency of prosaposin/saposins (PS–/–) in humans and mice leads to a decrease of GCase activity in selected tissues. Concordant decreases (>50%) of GCase protein and in vitro activity were detected in extracts of cultured fibroblasts and hepatocytes from PS–/– mice and human prosaposin-deficient fibroblasts. GCase RNA in the PS–/– cells was at wild-type levels. Compared with that in wild-type cells (t½ >24 h), the GCase protein in the PS–/– cells had a faster disappearance rate (t½ ∼1 h in mouse and ∼8 h in human) as determined by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation with anti-GCase antibodies. Treatment of PS–/– cells with leupeptin, an inhibitor of cysteine proteases, led to significant increases (∼2-fold) in GCase protein and in vitro activity. Loading saposin C to human PS–/– fibroblasts resulted in an enhancement of GCase protein and in vitro activity. Saposin D loading had no effect. These data indicate that saposin C is required for GCase resistance to proteolytic degradation in the cell. Thus, diminished in vivo GCase activity would be greater than expected only from the lack of GCase activation by saposin C.

The radioactive GCase bands were quantified by Amersham Biosciences ImageQuant software. RNA Analyses—Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent. Northern blots were performed as described (27Sun Y. Qi X. Witte D. Ponce E. Kondoh K. Quinn B. Grabowski G. Mol. Genet.

Real time RT-PCR reactions were performed to quantify mouse prosaposin and human GCase mRNA levels in the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (29Sun Y. Witte D.P. Jin P. Grabowski G.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 370: 557-566Crossref Google Scholar). 18 S RNA was used as internal control. The primers for RT-PCR reactions were as follows: mouse prosaposin, 5′-GCGACATATGCAAAACTGTTGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACAGGTCTTCTCCAGGTAATGAA-3′ (reverse); human GCase, 5′-GCAGTGTCGTGGGCATCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGACACACACCACCGAGCTGTA-3′ (reverse); 18S, 5′-GCATGGCCGTTCTTAGTTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGAACGCCACTTGTCCCTCT-3′ (reverse). Reduction of GCase in Prosaposin Knockout (PS–/–) Mice and Recovery of GCase Activity in PS–/–;TG Mice—Compared with those from strain-matched PS+/+ (WT) tissues, the in vitro GCase activities from tissue extracts of PS–/– mice were significantly reduced (65–80%) in liver and kidney. The slight decrease of GCase activity in cerebrum was not significant (Fig. 1A). In comparison, in vitro GCase activities were increased in extracts of liver and cultured fibroblasts from PS–/–;TG mice. By real-time RT-PCR analysis, the TG mRNA from liver and cultured fibroblasts of PS–/–;TG mice was ∼5–7% relative to the endogenous prosaposin in the corresponding WT samples. This low level of prosaposin TG expression was sufficient to increase the GCase activity by more than 2-fold relative to PS–/– mice (Fig. 1B). These results established a relationship between PS expression, the presence of saposin/prosaposin protein, and the in vitro level of GCase activity. Clearly, small amounts of PS expression were required to re-establish GCase activity. Importantly for these studies, the detergent assays used for estimating GCase in vitro activity do not require negatively charged phospholipids or saposin C. Indeed, the detergents (taurocholate and Triton X-100) replace the function of these two more natural activators and provide an assessment of the maximal catalytic power of GCase in cells (25Gatt S. Dinur T. Osiecki K. Desnick R.J. Grabowski G.A. Enzyme. 1985; 33: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, the activities are not related to the in vivo levels but rather reflect the level of catalytically active GCase within cells. Such reductions could be due to decreased synthesis of GCase, its folding, or its stability within the cells. Reduction of GCase Protein in PS–/– cells—To address the mechanism for GCase activity reductions, fibroblast and hepatocyte cultures were established from the wild type and PS–/– mice and used for immunoblot analysis. To eliminate the potential for diminished GCase gene expression, GCase RNA levels were determined by Northern analyses and were found to be the same as in WT and PS–/– samples (Fig. 2A). Importantly, GCase activities in the PS–/– cell extracts were reduced by ≥50% relative to WT (Fig. 2B). Immunoblots using anti-mouse GCase antiserum showed a concordant decrease in GCase protein (Fig. 2C). Essentially identical results were obtained with prosaposin-deficient cultured human fibroblasts using rabbit anti-human GCase antibodies (Fig. 5). These results show that the reduction of GCase activity in PS–/– cells is due to a decrease of GCase protein and not because of misfolding of GCase into an inactive conformer. However, this does not exclude the potential for diminished translation of the normal amounts of GCase mRNA. Turnover of GCase Protein in PS–/– and WT cells—Pulsechase studies were conducted to evaluate the synthetic levels of GCase protein and its stability in both mouse and human fibroblasts. Following metabolic labeling and chase, GCase in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-mouse or anti-human GCase antibodies. Quantitative immunoprecipitation of the GCase in cultured fibroblasts showed essentially the same levels of GCase signal from WT and PS–/– cells at 0 h of chase (Fig. 3). This excludes the possibility of a grossly abnormal translation of the amount of GCase mRNA in PS–/– cells. However, in WT cultured fibroblasts GCase protein was detectable for up to 72 h of chase. In contrast, GCase in PS–/– cells was at very low levels after 24 h of chase (Fig. 3). The GCases in WT cells have a t½ of >24 h and in PS–/– cells a t½ of ∼1 h in mouse or ∼8 h in human. These results show that essentially normal amounts of GCase are synthesized in PS–/– cells and that it was degraded at a much greater rate than in WT cells. Such enhanced degradation could occur by proteolysis in different compartments including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, or endosome/lysosomes. To establish the mechanism of saposin/prosaposin effect on GCase degradation, studies were conducted with protease inhibitors that exert their major effects in the lysosome. GCase Activity and Protein in PS–/– Cells Treated with Protease Inhibitors—PS–/– cultured mouse fibroblasts and hepatocytes were incubated with leupeptin, a cysteine protease inhibitor. Leupeptin inhibits protein degradation in the lysosome by 85% and in non-lysosome compartments by 15% (30Grinde B. Seglen P.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 632: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After 48 h of leupeptin exposure, both GCase activity and protein levels increased by ∼1.7–2-fold (Fig. 4). The final GCase activity and protein levels were comparable with those in WT fibroblasts (Fig. 4). Leupeptin treatment had little or no effect on WT GCase activities or protein. Treatment with pepstatin A, an aspartic protease (including cathepsins D and G) inhibitor, produced an ∼1.4-fold increase in GCase activity and protein in both PS–/– cell types (data not shown). In prosaposin-deficient human fibroblast cells, GCase RNA is at the same level as in WT control (Fig. 5A). Consistent with mouse samples, GCase activity and protein levels showed increases of 2- and 1.7-fold, respectively, after incubation with leupeptin-containing medium for 48 h (Fig. 5). Cathepsin inhibitor II, a selective lysosomal cysteine protease inhibitor, increased GCase activity and protein by ∼1.3-fold in human PS–/– fibroblasts (data not shown). Leupeptin (Fig. 5) and cathepsin inhibitor II treatment had no significant effect on GCase activity and protein in WT controls. The same results were obtained from primary human fibroblast cells. These results implicate the cysteine/aspartic protease participation in the degradation of GCase in the lysosome. In these cells, leupeptin, cathepsin inhibitor II, or pepstatin had no effect on β-glucuronidase activity, a soluble lysosomal enzyme that is not involved in glycosphingolipid metabolism. Saposin C Led to Recovery of GCase Activity and Protein in PS–/– Cells—PS–/– cultured human fibroblasts were incubated with human saposin C or saposin D in the medium. The cells loaded with saposin C showed significant increase of GCase activity and protein (Fig. 6). Saposin D had no effect on GCase in PS–/– cells (Fig. 6). The effects of saposins A and B on GCase activity were studied using the fibroblast from saposin A-deficient mice and a human saposin B-deficient patient. No alteration of GCase activity was observed in those cells. The results from our present study support saposin C as the protector for GCase. Saposins A and C enhance in vitro GCase activity (22Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Harzer K. Paton B.C. Christomanou H. Chatelut M. Levade T. Hiraiwa M. O'Brien J.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but only isolated saposin C deficiency leads to glucosylceramide storage and a “Gaucher disease-like” phenotype (9Rafi M.A. de Gala G. Zhang X.L. Wenger D.A. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1993; 19: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 12Schnabel D. Schroder M. Sandhoff K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 57-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In saposin A mutant mice, no accumulation of glucosylcerebroside was found (13Matsuda J. Vanier M.T. Saito Y. Tohyama J. Suzuki K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and GCase activity was not altered in fibroblasts from such mutant mice. Thus, saposin A is not a physiologically important activator or protector for GCase. Furthermore, saposins B and D do not have any effect on GCase activity (31Sandhoff K. Kolter T. Van Echten-Deckert G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 845: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). GCase activity was not reduced in human saposin B-deficient fibroblast. Loading saposin D to PS–/– cells had no effect on GCase. These results show that saposin C has a novel role as the anti-proteolytic protector for GCase in addition to being enzymatic activator. These studies indicate that the enhanced degradation of GCase in prosaposin-deficient mice and humans occurs largely in the lysosome. This finding has two implications. 1) GCase is normally folded and trafficked to the lysosome in PS–/– cells. The protection by the lysosomally directed protease inhibitors suggests that endoplasmic reticulum-localized proteolysis of GCase is unlikely or limited. Also, the presence of several isoforms of GCase in human prosaposin-deficient fibroblast indicates passage through the Golgi and consequent oligosaccharide remodeling (32Bergmann J.E. Grabowski G.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1989; 44: 741-750PubMed Google Scholar). 2) The “anti-proteolytic protective effect” of saposin/prosaposin results from interaction of GCase and mature saposins and not prosaposin. Prosaposin is processed proteolytically to the individual saposin in a late endosomal or lysosomal compartment (6Leonova T. Qi X. Bencosme A. Ponce E. Sun Y. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17312-17320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 33Fujibayashi S. Wenger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15339-15343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these findings support a mechanism of GCase protection whereby GCase is synthesized normally and trafficked to the lysosome in PS–/– cells. Upon arrival in the late endosome/lysosome compartments, GCase interacts with mature saposin C in such a manner as to inhibit its degradation by lysosomal proteases. The “protector protein” needed for β-galactosidase/neuraminidase stability and assembly represents a similar example, except that macromolecular assembly occurs in the Golgi (34Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28359-28365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 35van der Spoel A. Bonten E. d'Azzo A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1588-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The decrease of GCase activity shown in selected tissues of PS–/– mice suggests that saposin C may have a tissue-specific protective effect for GCase. For example, GCase in vitro activities are reduced in liver and kidney tissues but are not significantly altered in the brain of PS–/– mice. GCase is a lysosomal membrane-associated protein, and negatively charged phospholipids are required for the activation effect. In prosaposin-deficient cells, the disrupted sphingolipid metabolism appears to lead to a modification of lysobisphosphatidic acid organization. 2X. Qi, Y. Sun, and G. A. Grabowski, unpublished observation. Because this lipid may be the physiologic negatively charged phospholipid for GCase activation, saposin C deficiency may alter the interaction of GCase with this lipid and lead to proteolytic degradation. The degree of such phospholipid reorganization may be different in various tissues, particularly in the brain. This degree of lipid alteration also might contribute to the tissue-specific reduction of GCase activity in PS–/– mice. In addition, the group of proteases participating in degradation of GCase could be differentially expressed in the brain. The underlying mechanism of such tissue specificity needs to be investigated. It is unlikely that all of the glycosphingolipid activators would have protective functions for their cognate enzyme. β-Hexosaminidase A, the cognate enzyme for GM2 activator, maintained nearly normal activity in GM2 activator-deficient mice (36Liu Y. Hoffmann A. Grinberg A. Westphal H. McDonald M.P. Miller K.M. Crawley J.N. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2427-2442Google Scholar). Arylsulfatase A, which requires saposin B for optimal activation, showed normal levels in both human and mice with either saposin B or prosaposin deficiency (14Fujita N. Suzuki K. Vanier M.T.

Sun, and G. A. Grabowski, unpublished observation. In comparison, saposin A is essential for galactosylcerebrosidase to achieve maximal activity (40Morimoto S. Martin B.M. Yamamoto Y. Kretz K.A. O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3389-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The mouse models with deficient saposin A or prosaposin show decreased in vitro galactosylcerebrosidase activity (13Matsuda J. Vanier M.T. Saito Y. Tohyama J. Suzuki K. Hum. Mol.

Sun, and G. A. Grabowski, unpublished observation. Whether galactosylcerebrosidase was protected by saposin A and the possibility of saposin D being the chaperone for acid ceramidase are under investigation. In vitro and ex vivo turnover studies shows that GCase interacts with the inner lysosomal membrane (21Qi X. Grabowski G.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11544-11554Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 42Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. Mol. Genet.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30271-30278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Using artificial membrane systems of negatively charged phospholipids, saposin C facilitates the association of GCase with the membranes to favor the degradation of glucosylcerebroside (44Vaccaro A.M. Salvioli R. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The membrane attachment is essential for GCase stability and catalytic function. In addition to its activator functions, saposin C, as a protector, might play the role of enhancing the stability and efficiency of GCase in vivo by facilitating the association of enzyme to membrane. These functions of saposin C have implications for understanding the molecular pathogenesis of Gaucher disease and the development of more efficient therapies. Most of the GCase mutations that cause Gaucher disease disrupt the inherent catalytic function and/or the proteolytic stability of the mutant enzyme (45Grace M.E. Newman K.M. Scheinker V. He G.-S. Berg-Fussman A. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2283-2291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Grace M.E. Graves P.N. Smith F.I. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6827-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter results primarily from misfolding of GCase, but one could envision specific mutations that preclude or diminish interaction of GCase and saposin C. This could lead to an unstable enzyme, which could have nearly normal in vitro intrinsic residual activity as assessed with detergents. Certainly, mutations that affect the saposin C/GCase interaction site would lead to greater decreases of in vivo activity than expected from the GCase mutation alone. Similarly, disruption of the normal stoichiometry between GCase and saposin C would lead to proteolytic susceptibility of GCase. For example, GCase can be supplied by delivery to macrophages as purified enzyme or by over-expression in selected cells, e.g. a gene therapy approach. The delivery of large excesses of GCase to these cells could overwhelm the saposin C available for interaction. This excess enzyme would be very susceptible to proteolytic degradation and diminish the expected therapeutic benefit. Thus, preservation of the appropriate stoichiometry of saposin C and GCase could significantly enhance the efficacy/cost benefit of such therapeutic approaches.

https://openalex.org/W2022813892,"BRCA2 is a breast tumor susceptibility gene encoding a 390-kDa protein with functions in maintaining genomic stability and cell cycle progression. Evidence has been accumulated to support the concept that BRCA2 has a critical role in homologous recombination of DNA double-stranded breaks by interacting with RAD51. In addition, BRCA2 may have chromatin modifying activity through interaction with a histone acetyltransferase protein, p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF). To explore how the functions of BRCA2 may be regulated, the post-translational modifications of BRCA2 throughout the cell cycle were examined. We found that BRCA2 is hyperphosphorylated specifically in M phase and becomes dephosphorylated as cells exit M phase and enter interphase. This specific phosphorylation of BRCA2 was not observed in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents. Systematic mapping of the potential mitosis specific phosphorylation sites revealed the N-terminal 284 amino acids of BRCA2 (BR-N1) as the major region of phosphorylation and mass spectrometric analysis identified two phosphopeptides that contain “phosphorylation consensus motifs” for Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1). Phosphorylation of BR-N1 with Plk1 recapitulated the electrophoretic mobility change as seen in BR-N1 isolated from M phase cells. Plk1 interacts with BRCA2 in vivo, and mutation of Ser193, Ser205/206, and Thr203/207 to Ala in BR-N1 abolished Plk1 phosphorylation, suggesting that BRCA2 is the substrate of Plk1. Furthermore, both the hyperphosphorylated and hypophosphorylated forms of BRCA2 bind to RAD51, whereas the M phase hyperphosphorylated form of BRCA2 no longer associates with the P/CAF, suggesting that the dissociation of P/CAF-BRCA2 complex is regulated by phosphorylation. Taken together, these results implicate a potential role of BRCA2 in modulating M phase progression.

Disruption of the endogenous interaction between RAD51 and BRCA2 by ectopic expression of the BRC repeats leads to radiation sensitivity and G2/M checkpoint failure (26Chen C.F. Chen P.L. Zhong Q. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32931-32935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Recently, x-ray crystallographic studies of the highly conserved C-terminal domain of murine Brca2 (Brca2CTD) indicated that this domain binds to single- and double-stranded DNA hybrid structures. Moreover, purified Brca2CTD is able to stimulate RAD51-mediated DNA strand pairing and exchange in vitro (27Yang H. Jeffrey P.D. Miller J. Kinnucan E. Sun Y. Thoma N.H. Zheng N. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. Pavletich N.P. Science. 2002; 297: 1837-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that BRCA2 may have a direct role in facilitating crucial steps of RAD51-mediated HR. Besides roles in HR, BRCA2 has been linked to transcription regulation. The region encoded by exon 3 in the N terminus of BRCA2 when fused to a DNA-binding domain has the ability to activate transcription in yeast and mammalian cells; this transactivation activity is severely compromised by a cancer-predisposing mutation, tyrosine 42 to cysteine (28Milner J. Ponder B. Hughes-Davies L. Seltmann M. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1997; 386: 772-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the N-terminal region of BRCA2 interacts with P/CAF (29Fuks F. Milner J. Kouzarides T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2531-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), a transcriptional co-activator with intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity (30Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, the ability of BRCA2 to activate transcription may be explained via the recruitment of chromatin modifying activity in the form of P/CAF. The exact mechanism of how P/CAF or other histone acetyltransferases act as co-activators remains unclear, but it is believed that the transfer of acetyl groups to histone tails may act either as a “flag” for recruitment or to “loosen” chromatin structure to create an “activated state” by making nucleosomal DNA more accessible to transcription factors and polymerases (31Nakatani Y. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). To date, BRCA2 has not been shown to directly activate the transcription of a specific gene. Therefore, it is possible that the association of P/CAF may be required for other chromosomal metabolic functions. The genetic instability seen in BRCA2-deficient cells cannot be attributed solely to an absence of BRCA2-mediated HR. We therefore postulate that BRCA2 must be involved in chromosome metabolism throughout the cell cycle and predict that this must be a regulated function. A common mechanism for regulation is by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. Thus, we explored whether BRCA2 may be regulated through some form of post-translational modifications during the cell cycle. Here, we report that endogenous human BRCA2 protein is hyperphosphorylated specifically in M phase and show that the mitotic Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) interacts with BRCA2 in vivo and phosphorylates at least Ser193 and one or two residues in a Ser/Thr cluster (amino acids 203–207) of BRCA2 in vitro. Moreover, we found that RAD51 associates with both hyperphosphorylated (M phase form) and hypophosphorylated (interphase form) BRCA2 in vivo. On the other hand, P/CAF associates only with the hypophosphorylated form rather than the hyperphosphorylated form of BRCA2 in vivo. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of BRCA2 in M phase, at least by Plk1, regulates the dissociation of the BRCA2-P/CAF complex, implying a potential role of BRCA2 in modulating M phase progression. Cell Culture, Synchronization, and Transfection—Human bladder carcinoma T24 and osteocarcinoma U2OS cell line (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 50 units of penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C with 10% CO2. T24 cells, synchronized at G0/G1 by contact inhibition (33Chen P.L. Scully P. Shew J.Y. Wang J.Y. Lee W.H. Cell. 1989; 58: 1193-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), were seeded at low density to release them back into the cell cycle and thereafter were harvested at 0, 12, 18, and 24 h after seeding. M phase cells were enriched by treatment with 0.3 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 18 h starting at 24 h after release. To further isolate a distinct M phase population of cells, the slightly detached nocodazole-treated cells were shaken off (shake-off method). In order to enrich for M phase cells without nocodazole treatment, cells first were synchronized at S phase by double-thymidine block and then were released back into the cell cycle. Briefly, the cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine for 18–24 h, released for 8–10 h, and then treated with the same concentration of thymidine for another 16–18 h; the cells were released for another 8–10 h before being harvested. Finally, to release cells from nocodazole block (prometaphase or metaphase), arrested cells were collected using the mitotic shake-off method and washed with phosphate-buffered saline before being plated to allow re-entry into the cell cycle. Transfections were performed with Lipofectin reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. U2OS cells (1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were seeded 1 day before transfection, and fresh medium was added 18 h after transfection. Cells were incubated either in the absence or presence of nocodazole (0.3 μg/ml) at 30 h after transfection for another 18 h and then harvested for analyses. Cell Treatment with DNA-damaging Agents—Cycling T24 cells were exposed to 4000 radians of ionizing radiation (IR), 10 Jm-2 of ultraviolet light (UV), and then harvested 1 h later. The time of treatment of 20 μg/ml mitomycin C (Sigma), 10 mm hydroxyurea (Sigma), or 0.3 μg/ml nocodazole was 1, 2, or 18 h, respectively. IR was delivered using a 137Cs source. UV was delivered using a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) without culture medium. Construction of Plasmids—Full-length human BRCA2 cDNA was flanked with NotI and XhoI linkers at its 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, and then subcloned in pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). Various fragments of BRCA2 cDNA obtained using polymerase chain reactions were subcloned in pUGN, a pUHD10–3-based vector (Stratagene), or pCHPL-GFP2 (24Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5287-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Both of the vectors were engineered for gene fragments as N-terminal fusion with Myc-green fluorescent protein (Myc-GFP). To generate FLAG-mGST-BR-N1, the BR-N1 fragment was subcloned in FLAG-mGST, an engineered plasmid created by assembling mammalian GST cDNA in p3×FLAG-CMV-10 (Sigma). GST-BR-N1 wild type (WT) was generated by subcloning the BR-N1 fragment in pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). GST-BR-N1 mutants S183A, S193A, S239A, 4A, S193A+4A, and Δ193–207 were created using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the results were verified by sequencing. The murine HA-Plk1(WT) and HA-Plk1(K82M) (kinase-inactive) cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. Eisuke Nishida (Kyoto University, Japan) and Dr. Kyung S. Lee (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The FLAG-P/CAF construct was kindly provided by Dr. Yoshihiro Nakatani (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). Preparation of Whole-cell Extracts—Whole-cell extracts were prepared as described previously (34Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended in ice-cold NETN buffer (250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% NP-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3Vo4, and 10 mm glycerophosphate), and then subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Total protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation, Phosphatase Treatment of Immunoprecipitates, and Western Blot—Immunoprecipitations were carried out with a modification from Chen et al. (24Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5287-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole-cell extracts (about 3 mg) were first pre-cleared by incubation with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (1:1 slurry) (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatants were then incubated with 3 μg of murine IgG or anti-BRCA2 (BBA) monoclonal antibody (24Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5287-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) at 4 °C for 1.5 h and then incubated with 40 μl of a mixture of protein A- and G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Finally, beads were washed in ice-cold NETN buffer. Co-immunoprecipitation of HA-Plk1(WT) and GFP-BR-N1, HA-Plk1(WT), and BRCA2, RAD51 and BRCA2, or FLAG-P/CAF and GFP-BR-NL were carried out using anti-HA (12CA5), anti-BRCA2 (BBA), anti-RAD51 (14B4) (35Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), or anti-FLAG (M2) antibody (Sigma), respectively. For phosphatase treatment, BRCA2 immune complexes were washed in NETN buffer in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors and resuspended in phosphatase buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Parallel samples were incubated with or without calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 30 °C for 30 min. Western blots were developed by standard colorimetric procedures using the appropriate alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega, Madison, WI) or ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The BRCA2 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 6.5% SDS-PAGE and Western with anti-BRCA2 (Ab2) polyclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA). Ectopically expressed GFP fusion proteins in U2OS cells were probed with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science). In Vitro Kinase Assays—Plk1 kinase assay was adapted from Lee et al. (36Lee K.S. Yuan Y.L. Kuriyama R. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7143-7151Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Briefly, nocodazole-treated U2OS whole-cell extracts (500 μg) in NETN buffer were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of murine IgG, anti-HA (12CA5), or anti-Plk monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) at 4 °C for 1.5 h and then incubated with 20 μl of a mixture of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for another 1.5 h. Following extensive washing of the immune complexes with NETN buffer, kinase reactions were initiated by adding 50 μm cold ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 12 μl of Plk1 kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3Vo4, and 10 mm glycerophosphate) using 6 μg of dephosphorylated casein (Sigma), GST, or GST-BRN1 (wild type and mutants) as substrates. Cdk1 kinase assay was adapted from Park et al. (37Park M. Chae H.D. Yun J. Jung M. Kim Y.S. Kim S.H. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 542-545PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cycling U2OS whole-cell extracts (500 μg) in NETN buffer were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-Cdc2 (p34) monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and washed as described above. Kinase reactions were initiated by adding 50 μm cold ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 12 μl of Cdk1 kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2) using 3 μg of histone H1 (Roche Applied Science) and 6 μg of GST or GST-BRN1 as substrates. The kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of SDS protein sample buffer. One-third of the total volume was fractionated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining, autoradiography, or Western blot. Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant BRCA2 protein was expressed using the baculovirus expression system according to manufacturer's guide (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Briefly, ∼1 × 106 sf9 insect cells were infected with the baculovirus expressing full-length His-tagged BRCA2 at the appropriate multiplicity of infection. Infected cells were then harvested 48 h later and lysed in NETN buffer. For partial purification of recombinant FLAG-mGST-BR-N1 proteins, nocodazole-treated whole-cell extracts (200 10-cm dishes of U2OS) prepared in NETN buffer 48 h after transient transfection with FLAG-mGST-BR-N1 were subjected to immunoaffinity purification using anti-FLAG (M2) resins. The FLAG-mGST-BR-N1 immune complexes were eluted using SDS protein sample buffer, fractioned on 8.5% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot with anti-BRCA2 (I-17) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To purify GST fusion proteins, all of the recombinant GST-BR-N1 (wild type and mutants) proteins expressed in BL21 Star (DE3) (Invitrogen) were purified using glutathione-agarose resins according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Mass Spectrometry for the Identification of Phosphorylation Sites— Identification of phosphorylation sites using mass spectrometry was performed as described previously (38Zhang X. Herring C.J. Romano P.R. Szczepanowska J. Brzeska H. Hinnebusch A.G. Qin J. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2050-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). BRCA2 Is Hyperphosphorylated Specifically in M Phase— BRCA2 mRNA and protein levels have been shown to be present at high levels at late G1/early S phase in rapidly proliferating cells (39Vaughn J.P. Cirisano F.D. Huper G. Berchuck A. Futreal P.A. Marks J.R. Iglehart J.D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4590-4594PubMed Google Scholar, 40Bertwistle D. Swift S. Marston N.J. Jackson L.E. Crossland S. Crompton M.R. Marshall C.J. Ashworth A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5485-5488PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise expression profile of BRCA2 throughout the cell cycle remains unclear. We examined the expression of BRCA2 in synchronized human bladder carcinoma T24 cells following previously established protocols (33Chen P.L. Scully P. Shew J.Y. Wang J.Y. Lee W.H. Cell. 1989; 58: 1193-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, BRCA2 was expressed once cells enter S phase (lane 3, top panel). Conspicuously, we observed the appearance of several slower migrating forms of BRCA2 in extracts from cells enriched for M phase by nocodazole treatment (Fig. 1A, lane 6, top panel). This unique migration pattern was not observed in cell extracts from interphase cells or sf9 insect cells expressing recombinant BRCA2 (Fig. 1A, top panel, compare lane 6 with lanes 1–5). The phosphorylation pattern of retinoblastoma protein (Fig. 1A, middle panel, RB) was used as an indicator for the cell cycle phase as described previously (33Chen P.L. Scully P. Shew J.Y. Wang J.Y. Lee W.H. Cell. 1989; 58: 1193-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the slower migrating forms of BRCA2 resulted from the treatment of cells with nocodazole, M phase enriched cell extracts were prepared from T24 cells released from double-thymidine block without nocodazole (Fig. 1B; M-SN, M phase-synchronized extracts; M-EN, M phase-enriched extracts by nocodazole). Consistently, BRCA2 displayed similar slower migrating forms (Fig. 1B, top panel, compare lane 4 with lane 3). Furthermore, the slower migrating forms of BRCA2 were more distinct and prominent, using highly purified M phase cells, which were collected by shaking off slightly detached mitotic cells (Fig. 1B, top panel, lane 2; M-SO, “mitotic shake-off” extracts). Based on these observations, we conclude that the slower migrating pattern seen with BRCA2 is M phase-specific. Similar results were seen with another microtubule depolymerizing drug, vinblastine (41Clarke D.J. Gimenez-Abian J.F. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which is known to arrest cells in M phase (data not shown). To determine whether the alteration in electrophoretic mobility of BRCA2 was attributed to phosphorylation, immune complexes of BRCA2 from M phase and interphase cells were treated with phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 1C, the slower migrating forms of BRCA2 from M phase cells converted to a faster migrating form, which co-migrated with the form of BRCA2 from interphase cells (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 3–6), suggesting that BRCA2 becomes hyperphosphorylated as cells enter M phase. DNA Damage Does Not Induce an M Phase Phosphorylation Pattern Similar to BRCA2—DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of BRCA1 by ATM (ataxia telangiecstasia-mutated), ATR (ataxia telangiecstasia and Rad3-related), and CHK2 kinases has been shown (42Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar, 43Cortez D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2989-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). However, it is currently unknown whether DNA damage also induces phosphorylation of BRCA2. To test this possibility, asynchronous T24 cells were exposed to various DNA-damaging agents such as ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, mitomycin C, and hydroxyurea. All of these genotoxic agents induced dramatic alterations in electrophoretic mobility of BRCA1 (Fig. 2, middle panel, compare lane 2 with lanes 3–6). In contrast, the genotoxic agents failed to induce the conspicuously slower migrating forms of BRCA2 as observed in M phase (Fig. 2, top panel, lanes 3–6). We noted, however, that these genotoxic agents elicited slight but not distinctive changes in the mobility of BRCA2. BRCA2 Becomes Dephosphorylated upon Exit from M Phase—The fate of hyperphosphorylated BRCA2 in M phase was examined further in T24 cells released from nocodazole arrest. After the release from nocodazole block for 0.6–1 h, the slower migrating forms of BRCA2 were gradually converted to faster migrating forms (Fig. 3, top panel). At this time point, the fas"

MG can form covalent adducts on proteins resulting in advanced glycation end products that may alter protein function. Here we report that MG covalently modifies the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), a high conductance channel involved in the signal transduction of cell death processes. Incubation of isolated mitochondria with MG for a short period of time (5 min), followed by removal of excess free MG, prevented both ganglioside GD3- and Ca2+-induced PTP opening and the ensuing membrane depolarization, swelling, and cytochrome c release. Under these conditions MG did not significantly interfere with mitochondrial substrate transport, respiration, or oxidative phosphorylation. The suppression of permeability transition was reversible following extended incubation in MG-free medium. Of the 29 physiological carbonyl and dicarbonyl compounds tested only MG and its analogue glyoxal were able to specifically alter the behavior of the PTP. Using a set of arginine-containing peptides, we found that the major MG-derived arginine adduct formed, following a short time exposure to MG, was the 5-hydro-5-methylimidazol-4-one derivative. These findings demonstrate that MG rapidly modifies the PTP covalently and stabilizes the PTP in the closed conformation. This is probably due to the formation of an imidazolone adduct on an arginine residue involved in the control of PTP conformation (Linder, M. D., Morkunaite-Haimi, S., Kinnunen, P. J. K., Bernardi, P., and Eriksson, O. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 937–942). We deduce that the permeability transition constitutes a potentially important physiological target of MG.

MG binds covalently to proteins resulting in the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are involved in several pathological processes, including cellular proliferative disorders (1Thornalley P.J.

Increased formation of AGEs owing to hyperglycemia is a key factor in the development of diabetic complications such as microvascular disease and atherosclerosis (2Brownlee M.

The active site of triose phosphate isomerase harbors a flexible loop surrounding enzyme-bound reaction intermediate. This loop flickers continuously between open and closed states leading to a small but constant leakage of the unstable intermediate enediolate phosphate (8Williams J.C. McDermott A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8309-8319Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) that immediately undergoes phosphate elimination to yield MG.

Mitochondria play an important role in programmed cell death by releasing proteins from the intermembrane compartment, where they are normally confined, to cytosol and nucleus (20Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6257) Google Scholar). These proteins include cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO, which activate caspases, endonuclease G that induces DNA fragmentation, and apoptosis-inducing factor, which promotes caspase-independent chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation (21Yo S.-W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). The release of these pro-apoptotic proteins may be triggered by mitochondrial permeability transition (22Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). This event is induced by upstream apoptotic signals such as formation of the ganglioside GD3 (23Kristal B.S. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23169-23175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24Scorrano L. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Bernardi P. J. Biol.

Permeability transition is due to opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP) (22Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), which under normal cell life remains closed (26Eriksson O. Pollesello P. Geimonen E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1297-C1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the open conformation the PTP permits free diffusion of solutes with a molecular mass of <1.5 kDa across the mitochondrial membrane. Permeability transition leads to mitochondrial depolarization and equalization of matrix and cytosolic ion and metabolite concentrations. Concomitant osmotic swelling of the mitochondrial matrix may lead to rupture of the outer membrane and release of proteins from the intermembrane compartment. According to the prevalent model, permeability transition pores are composed of the adenine nucleotide translocator, the voltage-dependent anion channel, and mitochondrial matrix cyclophilin (27Desagher S. Martinou J.-C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar, 28Vieira H.L.A. Haouzi D. El Hamel C. Jacotot E. Belzacq A.S. Brenner C.

Ca2+ uptake does not elicit permeability transition in isolated mitochondria after treatment with the synthetic dicarbonyl compounds phenylglyoxal (PGO) or 2,3-butanedione (BAD) (29Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 937-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These compounds react specifically with the guanidino group of arginine, indicating that modification of an arginine residue by PGO or BAD stabilizes the PTP in its closed conformation. Interestingly, modification with the PGO analogue OH-PGO results in an arginine adduct that induces the open conformation of the PTP (32Linder M.D. Morkunaite-Haimi S. Kinnunen P.J.K. Bernardi P. Eriksson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 937-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The profound effect of arginine modification demonstrates that structural rearrangements of an arginine residue are of key importance for the control of the PTP conformation, although the location of that arginine residue is still unclear. The possibility that physiological PTP regulators act via that site prompted us to investigate whether the natural dicarbonyl compound MG was capable of inducing changes in the function of the PTP. In this study we have identified the mitochondrial PTP as a novel target of MG. Brief incubation of isolated rat liver mitochondria with MG led to complete suppression of both ganglioside GD3- and Ca2+-induced permeability transition. This also induced inhibition of cytochrome c release. Suppression of permeability transition by MG could be reversed by extended incubation in MG-free media. These findings demonstrate that MG induced a reversible covalent PTP modification, most likely an imidazolone derivative on an arginine residue involved in the control of the PTP conformation (29Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol.

The results of this study raise the possibility that MG reacts with the PTP under physiological conditions and that the altered PTP regulation perturbs the cell death program. Chemical Modification of Mitochondria—Preparation of liver mitochondria from male Wistar rats was performed as described previously (30Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (1 mg of protein/ml) were preincubated in modification medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 100 μm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, with or without MG for 5 min at 34 °C. The modification reaction was terminated by adjusting the pH to 6.8 with Hepes, cooling to 4 °C, and mitochondria were sedimented by centrifuging at 8000 × g for 5 min. Mitochondria were resuspended at a concentration of ∼50 mg of protein/ml in 250 mm sucrose, 100 μm EGTA, and 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4. Unless otherwise stated experiments were carried out at room temperature in assay medium containing 125 mm KCl, 5 mm succinate, 5 mm Pi-Tris, 2 mm Mg2+, 5 μm EGTA, 2 μm rotenone, 10 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4. In one experimental series MG was substituted by PGO. Oxygen consumption was measured using a Clark electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments). PTP Assays—Permeability transition was assayed by measuring membrane potential, Ca2+ transport and swelling. Medium [Ca2+] was measured using the fluorescent indicator dye Fluo-4FF (ex, 494 nm; em, 516 nm). Membrane potential was measured by TMRM fluorescence (ex, 550 nm; em, 575 nm), and swelling was monitored as a decrease in mitochondrial light scattering at 540 nm. Measurements were performed using a 96-well Tecan Spectrafluoplus plate reader or a PerkinElmer Life Sciences luminescence spectrometer LS50B. In swelling experiments, measured light scattering (I) was normalized by setting the initial scattering (I 0) of the mitochondrial suspension to one unit. Permeability transition was quantified using the initial swelling rate following addition of Ca2+. The initial swelling rate for mitochondria preincubated in the absence of MG was set to 100% permeability transition. The initial swelling rate for mitochondria preincubated in the absence of MG but supplemented with 1 μm CsA was set to 0% permeability transition. GD3 was dissolved to 5 mm in water and sonicated in a water bath for 5 min before use. To test compounds containing the carbonyl group for effects on the PTP, mitochondria were incubated at 1 mg of protein/ml for 15 min at room temperature in modification medium supplemented with the compound of interest at the following concentrations: 10, 30, 100, and 300 nm, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 330 μm, and 1, 3, and 10 mm. Mitochondria were diluted five times by addition of assay medium, and the effect of the compounds on the PTP was assessed following addition of Ca2+. Permeability transition was quantified as rate of swelling. Cytochrome c Release—Release of cytochrome c was determined by immunoblotting. The mitochondrial suspension was removed from the photometer cuvette, cooled to +4 °C degrees and centrifugated for 3 min at 21,000 × g. The pellet and the supernatant were separated, and proteins were precipitated by addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12% gels and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was performed using a monoclonal cytochrome c antibody (Zymed Laboratories) and visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Mass Spectrometry—For MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of MG-derived arginine adducts 100 μm of test peptide (NRVYIHPFHL, RVYVHPF, pEWPRQIPP, or YGGFMRF) was allowed to react with 2 mm MG in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, 100 μm EGTA, pH 8.0, at 34 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and cooling to 4 °C. The reaction mixture was desalted using a Zip Tip C18 silica bead microcolumn (Millipore). Peptides were eluted with acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid 1:2 and mixed with an equal volume of saturated α-HCA in the same solvent. Half a microliter of this solution was applied on the target. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Autoflex spectrometer using the linear detector in positive mode. Calibration of the machine was performed using the peaks of α-HCA and peptides of known masses. The rate constant value for formation of MG-derived arginine adducts was estimated from the relative peak intensity of native peptide and its MG derivatives after reaction for 1 min. For mass analysis of the GD3 ganglioside 0.5 nmol was mixed with 1 μl of 1 mm 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone in acetonitrile/20 mm ammonium citrate (1:1) and applied on the target. Mass spectra were recorded using the linear detector in negative mode. Electron Microscopy—Fixation of mitochondria was performed by adding 1% glutaraldehyde directly to the suspension. Embedding, sectioning, and staining were performed as described previously (30Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Sections were viewed in a Jeol 1200 transmission electron microscope at a magnification of ×10,000. Chemicals—CsA was a gift from Novartis, OH-PGO was from Pierce, 3-deoxyglucosone was from Toronto Research Chemicals, TMRM and Fluo-4FF were from Molecular Probes, and ganglioside GD3 was from Calbiochem. Analysis of GD3 by MALDI-TOF demonstrated that the C-2 N-fatty acyl-sphingosine moiety was a C18 fatty acid in 9%, C19 in 15%, C20 in 25%, C21 in 31%, and C22 in 20%. Other chemicals were from Sigma. 1Δ-Pyrroline 5-carboxylate was regenerated from its 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derivative as described previously (33Mezl V.A. Knox W.E. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We first studied the effect of MG on permeability transition induced either by the ganglioside GD3 or Ca2+. Mitochondria were preincubated for 5 min in the presence or absence of 2 mm MG followed by removal of free MG by centrifugation. These mitochondria were then incubated for 30 min in assay medium containing 25 μm GD3 or 10 μm Ca2+, whereupon mitochondria were processed for ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy and for analysis of cytochrome c release by immunoblotting. The results, shown in Fig. 1, demonstrated that both GD3 and Ca2+ caused extensive swelling and cytochrome c release in mitochondria preincubated in the absence of MG. Supplementing the medium with CsA, a selective high affinity inhibitor of permeability transition, prevented mitochondrial swelling and cytochrome c release, showing that both effects were due to permeability transition. Likewise, preincubation of mitochondria with MG completely prevented GD3- and Ca2+-induced swelling and cytochrome c release. These findings demonstrated that brief MG treatment effectively suppresses mitochondrial permeability transition. The onset of permeability transition is dependent on Ca2+ uptake and production of Δψ by substrate oxidation under the conditions used in Fig. 1. We verified that MG acted directly on the PTP, and not via these factors, investigating the effect of MG treatment on Δψ and Ca2+ transport. The membrane potential-sensitive dye TMRM was used to measure Δψ. Ca2+ uptake was assessed by measuring medium [Ca2+] using the membrane impermeable dye fluo-4FF, which becomes fluorescent upon Ca2+ binding. Mitochondrial swelling was monitored as a decrease in light scattering. First we studied the effect of GD3 on Δψ and swelling (Fig. 2). Mitochondria preincubated in the presence or absence of MG were suspended in assay medium, which was supplemented with 5 mm succinate after 2 min. This addition led to a rapid accumulation of TMRM, regardless of whether MG had been present or not during preincubation, showing that MG did not interfere with the production of Δψ by substrate oxidation (Fig. 2A). However, in mitochondria preincubated in the absence of MG the addition of 25 μm GD3 caused a release of TMRM, indicating a drop in Δψ (trace a). Addition of GD3 also induced a decrease in light scattering indicating that these mitochondria underwent swelling (Fig. 2B, trace a). Supplementing the medium of these mitochondria with CsA (trace b) or using MG-treated mitochondria (trace c) prevented both the GD3-induced drop in Δψ and swelling. We then proceeded to study Δψ, Ca2+ transport and swelling following Ca2+ addition (Fig. 3). Mitochondria were suspended in assay medium, and 10 μm Ca2+ was added after 2 min. The increase in medium [Ca2+] resulted in an increase in fluo-4FF fluorescence (panel C). Three minutes later mitochondria were energized by the addition of 5 mm succinate. In mitochondria preincubated without MG, this addition caused rapid swelling as indicated by the decrease in light scattering (panel B, trace a). Consistently, these mitochondria failed to produce Δψ in the presence of Ca2+ as indicated by the lack of both TMRM and Ca2+ accumulation (panels A and C, trace a). However, supplementing the medium of these mitochondria with CsA prevented swelling, and the mitochondria were able both to maintain Δψ (panel A, trace b) and take up Ca2+ (panel C, trace b). As expected, succinate addition to MG-treated mitochondria resulted in an immediate production of Δψ (panel A, trace c), rapid Ca2+ uptake (panel C, trace c), and prevention of swelling. These results indicate that MG acts directly on the PTP and not on Δψ production or Ca2+ uptake. This finding was further corroborated by measurements of respiration rate and Δψ production by ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 4). The results indicated that mitochondria retained their maximal respiration rates in the presence of ADP or the protonophoric uncoupler FCCP following preincubation with up to 2 mm MG (left panel). Similarly, preincubation with 2 mm MG had no effect on Δψ production by ATP hydrolysis as measured by the uptake of TMRM indicating that the function of the adenine nucleotide translocator and the ATPase was not affected by MG (right panel). In these initial experiments we used a supraphysiological MG concentration. To investigate the physiological significance of our findings, it was necessary to determine the quantitative relationship between MG concentration and suppression of permeability transition. Therefore we preincubated mitochondria with varying concentrations of MG followed by permeability transition using Ca2+ as the triggering signal. Permeability transition was quantified using the initial swelling rates, which were plotted against the preincubation concentrations of MG (Fig. 5). The plot indicates that the apparent K 50 for PTP inhibition is 600 μm and that MG had already a significant effect at 250 μm. Because MG reacts with proteins, resulting in both reversible and irreversible adducts, it was of interest to determine whether the effect of MG was reversible or not. To address this question we preincubated mitochondria with 2 mm MG or 2 mm PGO, which is known to form an irreversible adduct (30Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Following the modification reaction and removal of free MG or PGO, mitochondria were incubated in assay medium at room temperature for up to 3 h whereupon permeability transition was measured by swelling. The results shown in Fig. 5 (inset) indicated that suppression of permeability transition by MG was transient and disappeared after 2 h at room temperature. As shown previously the effect of PGO was irreversible (30Eriksson O. Fontaine E. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12669-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We then proceeded to investigate whether any physiological carbonyl compound other than MG was able to suppress permeability transition. We selected candidate carbonyl compounds from the main pathways of carbohydrate, amino acid, and fatty acid metabolism and some aliphatic aldehydes formed in the metabolism of alcohols. Mitochondria were incubated with each compound at concentrations of up to 10 mm in modification medium, whereupon permeability transition was assayed by swelling, using Ca2+ as the triggering signal. The results are presented in Fig. 6 and Table I. We first tested the α-oxoaldehydes glyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone, both of which are implicated in the formation of AGEs. Data showed that, whereas glyoxal effectively suppressed permeability transition at an apparent K 50 of 2 mm, 3-deoxyglucosone was completely without effect under the same conditions. CsA inhibited permeability transition in the submicromolar concentration range. For comparison we also used the highly toxic cross-linker glutaraldehyde, which was effective in the submillimolar concentration range. Other carbonyls were analyzed in a similar way, plots were constructed as in Fig. 6, and the results of these titrations are presented in Table I. The data indicate that none of the other compounds specifically altered the behavior of the PTP, despite the high chemical reactivity of several of them.Table IEffect of compounds containing the carbonyl group on permeability transitionCompoundK50Swelling at 1 mm±S.E.nmm%2-OxoaldehydesGlyoxal256.89.763-Deoxyglucosone115.216.93Carbohydrates and derivativesdl-Glyceraldehyde101.43.26dl-Erythrose95.416.72dl-Ribose89.014.02dl-Galactose130.920.34Dihydroxyacetone98.53.74d-Erythrylose87.522.42d-Ribulose105.523.72d-Fructose89.219.52d-Glucuronic acid115.023.04d-Glucose 6-phosphate87.46.66d-Fructose 6-phosphate108.250.66Amino acid metabolitesOxaloacetate92.95.16Pyruvate107.08.42α-Ketoglutarate113.79.14p-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate86.911.06Phenylpyruvate92.68.66α-Ketobutyrate92.47.54α-Ketoadipate94.21.821Δ-Pyrroline 5-carboxylate105.45.73Other aldehydesFormaldehyde (b)>10aThese compounds inhibited substrate transport and/or respiration.78.46.52Acetaldehyde (b)>10aThese compounds inhibited substrate transport and/or respiration.76.012.42Propionaldehyde103.211.64Glycoaldehyde97.68.48Acetone78.912.33Hydroxyacetone124.019.36Acetoacetic acid124.59.53Trans 2-hexenal4aThese compounds inhibited substrate transport and/or respiration.76.911.24Glutaraldehyde0.1aThese compounds inhibited substrate transport and/or respiration.1.71.42CsA0.2 μm—bThe initial swelling rate for mitochondria in the presence of CsA was set to 0% as described under “Experimental Procedures.”2a These compounds inhibited substrate transport and/or respiration.b The initial swelling rate for mitochondria in the presence of CsA was set to 0% as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab In general, formation of significant amounts of MG-derived arginine adducts on proteins requires hours or even days (12Westwood M.E.

TatA and TatE are homologous proteins with overlapping functions in the Tat pathway, and recent studies have suggested that tatE may be a cryptic gene duplication of tatA (4Sargent F. Bogsch E.G.

The tatC gene product is predicted to be a polytopic membrane protein with four (20Gouffi K. Santini C.L. Wu L.F.

Studies involving the thylakoid Tat system have shown that TatBC homologues form a complex that recognizes precursor proteins (21Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) while in the bacterial system TatB and TatC have also been shown to form a functional and structural unit, which acts as a receptor complex for the twin-arginine leader sequence of Tat-bound proteins (10Sargent F.

Recently, a protein that specifically binds the twin-arginine signal sequence of the E. coli dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO) reductase (DmsA subunit) was discovered (22Oresnik I.J. Ladner C.L. Turner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This 204-residue protein, DmsD, has homology to the TorD family of molecular chaperones (19Sargent F. Berks B.C. Palmer T. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis predicts that members of this family comprise at least two distinct structural domains (22Oresnik I.J. Ladner C.L. Turner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23Tranier S. Iobbi-Nivol C. Birck C. Ilbert M. Mortier-Barriere I. Mejean V. Samama J.P. Structure. 2003; 11: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). DmsD has also been shown to interact with the precursor form of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) reductase (TorA) (22Oresnik I.J. Ladner C.L. Turner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), a DmsA homologue that also binds a molybdopterin cofactor. However, DmsD is unable to interact with the fully folded mature forms of DmsA and TorA, suggesting that it interacts with the twin-arginine signal sequence (22Oresnik I.J. Ladner C.L. Turner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recent speculation proposes that DmsD might also have the ability to interact with the cofactorless (unfolded) mature portions of the two redox enzymes (18Palmer T. Berks B.C. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Sargent F. Berks B.C. Palmer T. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). An understanding of the role of DmsD in the Tat system is still in a preliminary stage. Previously, it was proposed that specific leader binding proteins might exist to escort twin-arginine containing proteins to the Tat translocase (22Oresnik I.J. Ladner C.L. Turner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this study, the targeting of DmsD to the E. coli inner membrane was investigated. It was shown that under anaerobic conditions, DmsD is associated with the inner membrane in wild type (WT) and dmsABC mutant strains of E. coli. However, in the absence of the Tat translocase complex, DmsD is found primarily in the cytoplasmic fraction. DmsD was also predominantly located in the cytosolic fraction of WT E. coli under aerobic conditions, indicating that the cellular physiology strongly influences the targeting of DmsD. Upon investigation of the nature of the interaction of DmsD with the membrane under anaerobic conditions, it was shown that DmsD interacts tightly with an integral membrane protein. Further investigation suggests that the TatB and TatC subunits are important for the interaction of DmsD with the membrane-associated Tat translocase. Thus, this work shows that the twin-arginine leader binding protein, DmsD, interacts with the TatBC twin-arginine signal sequence receptor complex on the E. coli inner membrane.

Upon harvesting, the cell paste was resuspended in a 10-fold (w/v) excess of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9 and 1 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A). The cell suspension was passed twice at 16,000 p.s.i through a French Pressure cell then centrifuged at 7800 × g for 25 min to remove unlysed cells, particulate, and protein aggregates (particulate fraction). Next, the clarified cell free extract was centrifuged at 165,000 × g for 90 min to separate the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions. The membrane fractions were resuspended and thoroughly washed in a 20-fold (w/v) excess of buffer A by 5 min of homogenization using a hand-held Wheaton 5-ml homogenizer. The membrane suspensions were centrifuged at 424,000 × g for 35 min to obtain the soluble and washed membrane fractions. Washed membranes were resuspended by homogenation in a 10-fold (w/v) excess of buffer A. All centrifugations were performed at 4 °C, and an aliquot of each fraction was kept. Pure DmsD was obtained following the methods of Oresnik et al. (22Oresnik I.J. Ladner C.L. Turner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and was used within a week of purification. A modified Folin-Lowry method (25Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 179-213Crossref Scopus (5346) Google Scholar) was used to determine the protein concentration of each fraction and bovine serum albumin Bio-Rad Protein Assay Standard II was used to obtain the standard curve. Protein expression levels were checked by Western blot using an antibody against the T7 epitope tag to ensure equivalent DmsD expression in all strains. DmsD was expressed through the leakiness of the T7 promotor, not through induction. Thus, DmsD was not overexpressed in the various strains in the studies reported here. Analysis of DmsD Localization—SDS-PAGE (12%) was performed using 50 μg of the 5 fractions of interest: the particulate, cytoplasmic, soluble, membrane, and washed membrane fractions. Additionally, 3.75 μg of purified DmsD was loaded onto each gel. The presence of DmsD in the various fractions was determined through Western blot analysis against the T7 epitope tag, using a 1:5000 dilution of T7 -HRP conjugate antibody (Novagen) in a 0.05% Tween-20 Tris buffered saline solution, pH 7.5. The bands were visualized using an HRP development buffer (Bio-Rad), and quantitated with NIH Imaging software. The percentage of DmsD in the cytoplasmic and washed membrane fractions was determined as follows: First, the micrograms of DmsD present in each band from each cell fraction was calculated by comparing the density of each band to the purified DmsD band, following Equation 1. (μgDmsD)bandofinterest=[(μgDmsD)purifiedband×(density)bandofinterest]/(density)purifiedDmsDband(Eq. 1) This value was used to determine the concentration of DmsD in each sample loaded onto the gel (Equation 2) and subsequently the micrograms of DmsD present in each fraction arising from the initial 1-liter culture (Equation 3). The fraction of interest may be a membrane fraction or a cytoplasmic fraction. [DmsD]fractionofinterest=(μgDmsD)bandofinterest/(μlfraction)loadedontogel(Eq. 2) (μgDmsD)totalfractionofinterest=[DmsD]fractionofinterest×(mlfraction)total(Eq. 3) The percentage of DmsD localized to the membrane fractions relative to the cytoplasmic fractions was calculated by totaling the micrograms of DmsD in both fractions, and setting that value to 100% as in Equation 4. (&x0025;DmsD)membrane=100×(μgDmsD)membrane/[(μgDmsD)membrane+(μgDmsD)cytoplasm](Eq. 4) Growth Conditions of Aerobic Cultures—Aerobic cultures (1 liter) of TG1 and tatABC mutant E. coli strains, transformed with pTDMS28 (Table I) were grown in 4-liter Fernbach flasks at 37 °C in LB media in a rotary shaker (250 rpm). Two of the cultures were induced with a final concentration of 0.1 mm IPTG at OD600 = 0.5, while the two other cultures were not induced. All four cultures were grown for an additional 2.5 h prior to harvesting. Cell fractions were purified and the presence of DmsD determined following the procedure described for the anaerobic cultures. Preparation of E. coli Lipid Vesicles (Liposomes)—Small unilamellar E. coli lipid vesicles (liposomes) were made using 125 μl of Avanti E. coli polar lipid extract (25 mg/ml). The lipid was dried with N2 (g) then resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A. The solution was frozen at –70 °C then thawed with warm water and vortexed. The freeze-thaw cycle was repeated five times to create multilamellar vesicles. Small unilamellar vesicles were created by repetitive sonication of the multilamellar vesicles using a Microson Ultrasonic Cell Disruptor at level 10 for 10 s, until the cloudy solution became clear (∼6×). 3 ml of buffer A was added to the liposomes, which were stored at –20 °C and used within 5 days of preparation. Liposome Interaction Studies Using Size Exclusion Chromatography—These studies were based on the methods of Millman et al. (26Millman J.S. Qi H.Y. Vulcu F. Bernstein H.D. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25982-25989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purified DmsD (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated with various ratios (wt/wt) of liposomes [2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:10] in 100 μl for 1 h at 23 °C. The solutions were loaded onto an XK-16 Amersham Biosciences column containing 12 ml of Sepharose CL-4B resin (Amersham Biosciences), with inclusion limits of 60 kDa to 2000 kDa. The column was equilibrated with a minimum of two column volumes of buffer A, filtered with a 0.20 μm White Nylon Millipore filter. Samples were also eluted with buffer A, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The column was calibrated using blue dextran as a marker of void volume (Vo), and the elution volumes of DmsD and the liposomes were also determined and used for reference. High molecular weight DmsD aggregates were removed prior to experimentation by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min then the supernatant was filtered using a 0.20 μm sterile syringe. Chromatograms were analyzed using Unicorn 3.21 software (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins present in each 1-ml fraction were precipitated by the addition of 100 μl of 100% w/v trichloroacetic acid. The fractions were vortexed then incubated at –20 °C for 20 min. Next, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and decanted. The precipitate was resuspended in 10 μl of 0.1 n NaOH and 10 μl of Laemmli Solubilization Buffer (LSB: 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 2% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) then analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The presence of the T7 epitope-tagged DmsD was visualized by Western blot, as described in previous sections. Washing Studies of E. coli Membranes—Washed membranes derived from WT (MC4100 and TG1) E. coli transformed with pTDMS28 (described above) were resuspended with 5 min of homogenization and washed with a 35-fold (v/v) excess of various buffers: double distilled H2O, buffer A, 10 mm NH4HCO3, 1% Triton X-100, 20% isopropyl alcohol, 2% w/v n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 10 mm EDTA, and 4 m urea. 1 ml of the respective wash buffer was added to the WT/pTDMS28 membranes at 4 °C, containing 200 μg of total protein. The samples were vortexed for 10 s, and then incubated on ice for 15 min. This was repeated four times, then samples were centrifuged for 35 min at 424,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were removed and proteins were precipitated as described in the previous section. The membrane pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of LSB, and in the case of the membrane samples washed with acetic acid, an additional 1 μl of 1 m NaOH was added. Both membrane and supernatant samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the presence of DmsD in the various fractions was determined through Western blot analysis against the T7 epitope tag. Urea Titration of WT Membranes—WT (MC4100 and TG1)/pTDMS28 buffer-washed membranes were re-solubilized with 1 ml of 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 m urea (ICN). Samples were prepared, washed, and analyzed as described above. DmsD Interacts with the E. coli Inner Membrane under Anaerobic Conditions—In order to determine the location of DmsD in WT MC4100 E. coli transformed with pTDMS28, anaerobically grown cultures were harvested and the cells were fractionated. Western blot analysis of whole cells revealed equivalent expression of tagged DmsD in all strains and expression levels were further verified by Western blotting of the particulate fractions and cell free lysates (data not shown). As previously mentioned, DmsD was not overexpressed in these cells, thus targeting within the cell would not be due to expression artifact. Western blot results against the T7 epitope tag clearly show that under anaerobic conditions, DmsD is associated with the E. coli inner membrane fraction and is not found in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 1, lane 1). Further rigorous washing of the membranes with buffer did not result in dissociation of DmsD from the membrane since DmsD was not present in the soluble fraction following additional buffer washes (results not shown). This result was obtained in 5 independent experiments, using both MC4100 and TG1 E. coli strains (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 6). Location of DmsD in Various tat Mutants—In contrast to the WT results, DmsD was found in both the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions of a ΔtatABCDE strain transformed with pTDMS28 (Fig. 1, lane 2). The number of micrograms of protein loaded into each well of the SDS-PAGE gel was normalized, thus the Western blot band intensities are not indicative of the relative percentage of DmsD located in a given fraction of E. coli. In order to determine the percent DmsD in the cytoplasmic fractions relative to the membrane fractions of E. coli cells arising from a 1-liter culture, the Western blot data was quantitated. Quantitation of DmsD present in the ΔtatABCDE 1-liter culture revealed that 95% of DmsD was located in the cytoplasmic fraction compared with only 5% that remained associated with the membrane fraction (Fig. 2). As in the WT cells, a rigorous buffer wash did not result in dissociation of the remaining DmsD from the membranes of the tat mutants (Fig. 1). To determine which subunits were important for the interaction of DmsD with the Tat translocase, the location of DmsD in 6 tat mutants was assessed. As in WT E. coli, DmsD was located exclusively in the membrane fractions of strains with tatA, tatD, tatE, or tatAE gene deletions (Fig. 1). In contrast, the ΔtatB and ΔtatC strain results (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8) were comparable to the results obtained for the total tat deletion strain (Fig. 1, lane 2). For both ΔtatB and ΔtatC strains, the majority of DmsD (88%) was located in the cytoplasm, while only 12% was associated with the inner membrane (Fig. 2). In all strains, a buffer wash did not dissociate the remaining DmsD from the membrane (Fig. 1, washed membranes). Location of DmsD in a dmsABC Mutant—To assess whether or not the targeting of DmsD to the inner membrane was dependent upon the presence of DmsABC, a ΔdmsABC mutant was studied. In this mutant, DmsD was located exclusively in the membrane fraction and remained on the membrane even after an extensive buffer wash (Fig. 3, lane 2). Effect of Aerobic Conditions on the Location of DmsD—To investigate the effect of an aerobic environment on the targeting of DmsD, WT and ΔtatABC E. coli strains transformed with pTDMS28 were grown under aerobic conditions. In contrast to the results obtained for WT E. coli in anaerobic environments, DmsD was primarily located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4). Likewise, DmsD was also found in the cytoplasmic fraction of a tatABC-deficient strain. The induction of pTDMS28 with IPTG had no apparent effect on the location of DmsD within the cell, with only trace amounts found associated with the membrane. DmsD Does Not Interact with E. coli Lipid Vesicles—To determine whether the interaction of DmsD with the membrane was protein or lipid mediated, purified DmsD was incubated with E. coli liposomes, then studied using SEC. The void volume (Vo) of the column was 3.4 ml, determined using blue dextran as a marker (data not shown). Liposomes eluted at Vo (Fig. 5A, solid line), while a purified and filtered sample of DmsD eluted at 6.6 ml (Fig. 5A, dashed line). There was no evidence of interaction between DmsD and E. coli lipid upon the incubation of DmsD with a 10-fold excess of liposomes. This was indicated by two separate elution peaks at 3.4 ml and 6.6 ml (Fig. 5B) corresponding to E. coli lipid vesicles and purified DmsD. Western blot analysis of the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated fractions confirmed that DmsD was not present in the liposome elution peak of 3.4 ml (data not shown). The results were similar for all ratios of DmsD to liposomes (data not shown). Nature of the Interaction of DmsD with the E. coli Inner Membrane—To elucidate what type of interaction is occurring between DmsD and the E. coli inner membrane, buffer-washed membranes derived from the WT (TG1)/pTDMS28 E. coli strain were resuspended and washed vigorously with various solutions. DmsD remained on the membrane in the presence of all eight solutions used (Fig. 6, membranes). Only in the presence of 4 m urea was any significant amount of DmsD located in the soluble fraction corresponding to the washed membranes (Fig. 6, soluble fraction, lane 5). The results were similar using an MC4100/pTDMS28 strain (data not shown). To investigate the strength with which DmsD was associated with the membrane, WT (TG1)/pTDMS28 E. coli membranes were solubilized with increasing concentrations of urea. DmsD remained tightly associated with the membrane at low concentrations of urea (0.5–3.0 m) (Fig. 7, membranes, lanes 1–4) with only trace amounts present in the corresponding soluble fractions (Fig. 7, soluble fraction, lanes 1–4). Above 3 m urea, increasing the concentration of urea resulted in an increasing amount of DmsD located in the soluble fractions (Fig. 7, lanes 5–8). However, only in the presence of 8 m urea was the vast majority of DmsD dissociated from the membrane (Fig. 7, lane 8). An MC4100/pTDMS28 strain gave similar results (data not shown). In this study various E. coli fractions were analyzed for the presence of DmsD, with the goal of determining the subcellular location of DmsD within E. coli. This was achieved by Western blot analysis using an antibody against the T7 epitope tag. Under anaerobic conditions DmsD is found on the E. coli inner membrane of both WT and dmsABC mutant strains. In contrast, the majority of DmsD was found in the cytoplasmic fraction of a total tat deletion mutant under the same growth conditions. This interaction is strongly influenced by the presence or absence of oxygen in the growth environment. Our next goal was to elucidate the nature of the interaction of DmsD with the E. coli inner membrane under anaerobic conditions. SEC data and vigorous membrane washing studies suggest that DmsD is strongly interacting with an integral membrane protein. Further investigation revealed that the interaction of DmsD with the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane is dependent upon the TatB and TatC subunits. The results presented in this study illustrate that DmsD is associated with the E. coli inner membrane under anaerobic conditions. Strains lacking the TatA, TatD, or TatE subunits give rise to the same result as WT strains, where DmsD is associated with the inner membrane. TatD is not required for protein translocation using the Tat pathway (9Wexler M. Sargent F. Jack R.L. Stanley N.R. Bogsch E.G. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16717-16722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), thus it is not surprising that DmsD behaves similarly in both ΔtatD and WT strains. Likewise, the targeting of DmsD is not affected by the absence of the TatA or TatE subunits. The identical results obtained with the ΔtatA, ΔtatE and ΔtatAE strains are in accordance with genetic experiments, which show that the TatA and TatE homologues have overlapping functions in the Tat pathway (4Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 5Weiner J.H. Bilous P.T. Shaw G.M. Lubitz S.P. Frost L. Thomas G.H. Cole J.A. Turner R.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). DmsD was also associated with the E. coli inner membrane in a ΔdmsABC mutant strain. This suggests that the targeting of DmsD to the E. coli inner membrane is not driven by its association with the DmsA preprotein. The absence of the Tat complex has a dramatic effect on the localization of DmsD within E. coli. Although a small fraction of DmsD is still targeted to the inner membrane, the absence of the translocase appears to greatly hinder the interaction of DmsD with the membrane. This was evident in the ΔtatABCDE, ΔtatB, and ΔtatC strains, in which DmsD was found primarily in the cytoplasmic fractions. These results suggest that DmsD interacts with the TatB and TatC subunits of the translocase complex. A mutation in either subunit appears to prevent the interaction of DmsD with the Tat complex. However, the absence of both subunits does not seem to result in a statistically greater percentage of DmsD located in the cytoplasmic fraction. This suggests that both subunits are equally important for the interaction of DmsD with the Tat complex. These results are in accordance with previous work, which has demonstrated that the TatB and TatC subunits act in concert and form a functional and structural unit (10Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36073-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 14Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C.M. Robinson C. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also shown that a TatBC complex containing some TatA protein is capable of binding a Tat signal peptide, while a complex composed predominantly of TatA with small amounts of TatB was incapable of this interaction (15de Leeuw E. Granjon T. Porcelli I. Alami M. Carr S.B. Muller M. Sargent F. Palmer T. Berks B.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 1135-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction of DmsD, a twin-arginine leader-binding protein, with the TatB and TatC subunits is consistent with current literature which suggests that the TatBC proteins form a receptor complex capable of recognizing the twin-arginine signal sequence of substrate proteins (18Palmer T. Berks B.C. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The liposome SEC and membrane washing results provide additional support for the interaction of DmsD with a protein component of the E. coli inner membrane. In a related study, Millman et al. (26Millman J.S. Qi H.Y. Vulcu F. Bernstein H.D. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25982-25989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) generated phopholipid liposomes and used SEC to investigate how FtsY, a membrane-associated signal recognition particle (SRP) receptor, binds to the inner membrane of E. coli. SRP is involved in the co-translational targeting of nascent polypeptide chains to the E. coli inner membrane through an interaction with FtsY (27Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4880-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To investigate whether or not DmsD interacts with the E. coli inner membrane via lipid interactions, Millman's methods were followed. The SEC data, verified by Western blot analysis against the T7-epitope tag of DmsD, demonstrate that DmsD is not interacting with the lipid component of the membrane, suggesting that the interaction is protein mediated. Vigorous washing of the anaerobic membranes with various solutions reveal that a chaotropic agent, such as urea, is needed to disrupt the interaction of DmsD with the membrane. This suggests that DmsD is interacting tightly with an integral membrane protein or proteins. Folding studies 2K. J. Sarfo, A. L. Papish, T. L. Winstone, J. M. Binotto, H. Kadir, H. J. Vogel, and R. J. Turner, manuscript in preparation. have shown that DmsD starts to denature in the presence of ∼4 m urea, which is consistent with the concentration above which a significant amount of DmsD was dissociated from the E. coli inner membrane. Thus, it appears that DmsD denaturation is required for the disruption of its interaction with the membrane. Another important observation from this study is that the physiological conditions have a significant effect on the localization of DmsD in WT E. coli, as evidenced by the distinct results obtained for WT E. coli grown aerobically versus anaerobically. DmsD binds the twin-arginine signal sequences of dimethylsulfoxide and TMAO reductase (22Oresnik I.J. Ladner C.L. Turner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), two enzymes that are physiologically active under anaerobic conditions (29Simala-Grant J.L. Weiner J.H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 3231-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Weiner J.H. Rothery R.A. Sambasivarao D. Trieber C.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Therefore, it follows that the interaction of DmsD with the membrane would be dependent upon an anaerobic environment. Although DmsD is associated with the membrane in anaerobic environments, hydropathy analysis of the sequence suggests that DmsD is not a membrane protein. 3R. J. Turner, unpublished results. The evidence presented in this study demonstrates that under anaerobic conditions, DmsD is targeted to the membrane-bound Tat complex in E. coli and is interacting tightly with the TatBC signal sequence receptor complex. It was also shown that this interaction is independent of the DmsA preprotein and is dependent upon the physiological conditions of the cell. Thus, this work further supports the prediction that DmsD might function as a targeting chaperone (22Oresnik I.J. Ladner C.L. Turner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), assisting in the interaction of DmsA with the Tat translocase. An interesting challenge for the future will be to determine the mechanism by which this occurs. We thank Dr. F. Sargent (University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK), Dr. D. Sambasivarao, and Dr. J.

https://openalex.org/W2075855957,"Copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is an abundant intracellular enzyme with an essential role in antioxidant defense. The activity of SOD1 is dependent upon the presence of a bound copper ion incorporated by the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase, CCS. To elucidate the cell biological mechanisms of this process, SOD1 synthesis and turnover were examined following 64Cu metabolic labeling of fibroblasts derived from CCS +/+ and CCS –/– embryos. The data indicate that copper is rapidly incorporated into both newly synthesized SOD1 and preformed SOD1 apoprotein, that each process is dependent upon CCS and that once incorporated, copper is unavailable for cellular exchange. The abundance of apoSOD1 is inversely proportional to the intracellular copper content and immunoblot and gel filtration analysis indicate that this apoprotein exists as a homodimer that is distinguishable from SOD1. Despite these distinct differences, the abundance and half-life of SOD1 is equivalent in CCS +/+ and CCS –/– fibroblasts, indicating that neither CCS nor copper incorporation has any essential role in the stability or turnover of SOD1 in vivo. Taken together, these data provide a cell biological model of SOD1 biosynthesis that is consistent with the concept of limited intracellular copper availability and indicate that the metallochaperone CCS is a critical determinant of SOD1 activity in mammalian cells. These kinetic and biochemical findings also provide an important framework for understanding the role of mutant SOD1 in the pathogenesis of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) 1The abbreviations used are: SOD1, copper/zinc superoxide dismuatse; CCS, copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase; MEFs, mouse embryonic fibroblasts; TEPA, tetraethylenepentamine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is a ubiquitously expressed, homodimeric intracellular enzyme essential for antioxidant defense (1Fridovich I.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). SOD1 catalyzes the disproportionation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, and this reaction is dependent upon a single bound copper ion present in each monomeric subunit. Previous studies in yeast have revealed that under physiological circumstances intracellular copper availability is extraordinarily restricted (3Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). As a result, the delivery of copper to specific pathways within the cell is mediated by a family of proteins termed metallochaperones that function to provide copper directly to target pathways while protecting this metal from intracellular scavenging (4O'Halloran T.V.

Consistent with this concept, recent studies have revealed that the incorporation of copper into SOD1 in yeast and mammals is mediated by a metallochaperone termed the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) (7Culotta V.C.

Biochemical and structural studies indicate that the process of copper incorporation into SOD1 is accomplished via direct protein-protein interaction involving a CCS-SOD1 heterodimeric intermediate (9Casareno R.L.B.

Although the strong affinity of the SOD1 dimer would suggest that CCS inserts the metal co-translationally or immediately following de novo SOD1 synthesis, studies in yeast demonstrate that CCS can insert copper post-translationally into SOD1 in vivo, suggesting that pre-existing apo dimers of SOD1 exist within the cell and may serve as a target for CCS (12Schmidt P.J. Kuns C. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33771-33776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is currently no understanding of how CCS obtains copper within the cell, if there is any intermediate copper pool and once incorporated into SOD1 if this copper is available for exchange. In this current study a cellular model of CCS deficiency has been utilized to address these questions and to elucidate the cell biological mechanisms of CCS function. Materials—General chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma. Protein A beads were purchased from Repligen. DNA restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from Promega and used according to the manufacturer's specifications. Hybridization membranes and ECL reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Polyclonal rabbit antisera to human and rat SOD1 were purchased from Stressgen. Additional antibodies to human SOD1 and CCS were prepared and used as described previously (9Casareno R.L.B. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

To generate additional antisera to human CCS, an amino acid peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal forty amino acids of human CCS was synthesized and used to produce polyclonal antisera in rabbits (Alpha Diagnostics International, San Antonio, TX). Experiments were performed with antisera that was affinity purified against the CCS peptide coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B column. [35S]Methionine and [35S]Cysteine Translabel and [35S]Cysteine were purchased from ICN Radiochemicals. 64Cu (750 Ci/mmol) was obtained by fast neutron bombardment of a natural zinc target and used as described previously (8Wong P.C.

Cell Culture and Metabolic Labeling—HeLa and HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in basal growth media composed of DMEM with 10% bovine serum as described (9Casareno R.L.B.

For some cell culture experiments, CCS +/+ and CCS –/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from E12.5 embryos were isolated and cultured in basal media. After the first passage these MEFs were genotyped by PCR analysis as described (8Wong P.C. Waggoner D.W. Subramaniam J.R. Tessarollo L. Bartnikas T.B. Culotta V.C. Price D.L. Rothstein J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated MEFs from SOD +/+ and SOD –/– E12.5 embryos were isolated and allowed to adhere to tissue culture plates for four hours, then used immediately for metabolic experiments. Cells were pulse-labeled for 3 h with 20 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine and chased with serum-free medium for the indicated time points, followed by collection of media and lysate for immunoprecipitation as described previously (9Casareno R.L.B. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was then determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). Samples were subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and analyzed by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) or exposure to Eastman Kodak Co. MR film. Signal intensity was quantified with Un-scan-it imaging software (Silk Scientific Corporation). For copper labeling, cells were incubated in Optimem media containing 100 μCi/ml 64Cu for 3 h, and chased with serum-free medium for the indicated time points, followed by collection of media and lysate as described previously (19Hellman N.E.

Samples were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer with or without reducing agents as indicated, subjected to electrophoresis in 4–20% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels, and gels exposed directly to a PhosphorImager. 64Cu signal intensity was quantified as noted above. In some experiments, to maximize copper incorporation into SOD1, cells were preincubated for 48 h with 50 μm of the copper chelator tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), followed by extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) prior to the addition of 64Cu as described previously (20Hellman N.E.

Counts per minute (cpm) of 64Cu per μg cell lysate were measured using a Cobra-II Auto-Gamma counter (Packard). Experiments utilizing 64Cu incorporation in mice were carried out as previously described (8Wong P.C. Waggoner D.W. Subramaniam J.R. Tessarollo L. Bartnikas T.B. Culotta V.C. Price D.L. Rothstein J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In studies examining 64Cu-SOD1 turnover, samples were stored and counted at the same time to allow for the half-life of the isotope. Immunoblot Analysis and SOD Activity Gels—Cell lysates were prepared in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4/0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40)/150 mm NaCl supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem Corp.) on ice for 15 min, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 6,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein concentration for all samples was determined by Bradford's method (BioRad). For specified experiments, lysates were heated at 100 °C for 10 min in the presence of SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C before loading the supernatant onto SDS-PAGE (9Casareno R.L.B. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For specific experiments, immunoblot analysis was performed following non-denaturing electrophoresis of lysates in Criterion 4–20% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels, transfer to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), followed by UV cross-linking, boiling membranes in 2% SDS/50 mm Tris, pH 7.6 for 10 min and extensive washing in PBS. In all cases immunoblot analysis was carried using either the Super-Signal West Pico or West Femto Chemiluminescence kits (Pierce) with goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce). SOD activity gels were performed by electrophoresing lysates on SDS-PAGE gels followed by washing in deionized water for 1 h and then processing for SOD activity as previously described (8Wong P.C. Waggoner D.W. Subramaniam J.R. Tessarollo L. Bartnikas T.B. Culotta V.C. Price D.L. Rothstein J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration chromatography was performed at 4 °C with an ÄKTA FPLC system and a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS. Protein standards were used to calibrate molecular mass to elution volume. 5 mg of liver lysates from CCS +/+, CCS–/–, SOD +/+, and SOD –/– mice were prepared in 250 μl of PBS, applied to the column and then eluted with PBS in 0.5-ml fractions at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Individual fractions were monitored for the presence of specific proteins by immunoblot analysis as indicated above. Guanidine Denaturation—10 μg of purified human SOD1 (Sigma) was resuspended in PBS with 6 m guanidine at 4 °C for increasing incubation times from 0 to 9 h (20Hellman N.E. Kono S. Mancini G.M. Hoogeboom A.J. De Jong G.J. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46632-46638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Protein samples were then precipitated with 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% EtOH by incubation at –80 °C for 10 min and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Pellets were then washed with 2 volumes of ice-cold 80% EtOH, dried, and resuspended in PBS followed by SDS-PAGE under non-denaturing conditions and detection of protein with Coomassie Blue dye. To analyze copper incorporation into SOD1, 64Cu was injected into SOD1+/+ and SOD1–/– mice followed by non-denaturing, non-reducing PAGE of tissue lysates. A single 64Culabeled band was observed in lysates from SOD1+/+ mice that co-migrated with SOD1 dismutase activity and immunoreactivity (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 3, 5) and was absent in identical samples from SOD1–/– mice (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 4, 6). These data confirmed that the labeled species observed under these conditions is murine SOD1, thus permitting an analysis of the kinetics of copper incorporation into this protein. To determine these kinetics, immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from wild-type CCS+/+ mice were pulse-labeled with 64Cu for 5 min, chased in media with 100-fold excess non-radioactive copper for the times indicated and cell lysates examined as above. As can be seen in Fig. 1B, 64Cu-SOD1 was observed at the earliest chase time and the abundance of this protein did not exchange over the chase period. Similar experiments in human HepG2 cells also identified a 64Cu-labeled band comigrating with SOD1 dismutase activity and immunoreactivity (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2) that was eliminated by preincubation of lysates with SOD1-specific antisera (data not shown) and pulse-chase analysis of copper incorporation into SOD1 in these cells revealed identical kinetics to that observed in murine fibroblasts (Fig. 1C, lanes 3–6). In some experiments, cells were preincubated for 48 h with 50 μm of the copper chelator tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) prior to incubation with 64Cu. Although pretreatment with TEPA increased the amount of copper incorporated into SOD1, in all cases the results of pulse and pulse-chase experiments were identical regardless of prior chelation (data not shown). These kinetic data reveal that copper is almost immediately incorporated into SOD1 and that no exchange of this metal occurs in this initial chase period. To determine if incorporated copper is available for exchange into other proteins over time, the half-life of SOD1 was determined following metabolic labeling of CCS+/+ fibroblasts with [35S]cysteine or 64Cu. This analysis revealed similar half-lives for SOD1 labeled either at the protein backbone or copper site (half-lives of 38.7 ± 0.6 and 34.2 ± 4.5 h, respectively), indicating that once incorporated into SOD1, copper is unavailable for exchange, remaining with SOD1 until this protein is degraded (Fig. 1D). Identical results were obtained when these experiments were repeated in other mammalian cell lines (data not shown). The kinetic data indicate that copper is rapidly incorporated into SOD1 without prolonged equilibration in a cytosolic pool and that no exchange of this metal from SOD1 occurs following this process. To determine the mechanisms of copper incorporation, cell lines were treated with cycloheximide prior to pulse labeling with 64Cu. Under conditions that reduced total protein synthesis to greater than 95%, 64Cu incorporation into SOD1 was reduced (Fig. 2A). As anticipated from the half-life of SOD1, this treatment was without effect on steady-state SOD1 activity or total SOD1 protein (Fig. 2A). 64Cu incorporation into newly synthesized SOD1 was undetectable in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from CCS–/– mice regardless of cycloheximide treatment, consistent with the essential role of this chaperone in copper incorporation into SOD1 (Fig. 2A). Human and murine SOD1 migrate at different rates under these conditions, accounting for the apparent size difference (Fig. 2A). Quantitative analysis revealed that copper incorporation into SOD1 was consistently reduced to about 50% of normal following abrogation of new protein synthesis with cycloheximide (Fig. 2B). In all cases this effect of cycloheximide was reversible and without effect on either the initial uptake of copper or the time required for detectable 64Cu incorporation into SOD1 (data not shown). The cycloheximide data reveal that new protein synthesis is required for copper incorporation into a significant portion of cellular SOD1 and that this process is dependent upon CCS. As the half-life of this copper chaperone is greater than 19 h, 2T. H. Bartnikas and J. D. Gitlin, unpublished observations. and this protein is the only critical factor for copper incorporation under these conditions, the cycloheximide-sensitive process must represent copper incorporation into newly synthesized SOD1, with the cycloheximide-resistant pool representing preformed apoSOD1. To directly examine this possibility, these experiments were repeated in cells preincubated with TEPA to render the SOD1 pool entirely inactive apoSOD1, as indicated by the absence of SOD1 activity (Fig. 3A). Cycloheximide had no detectable effect on 64Cu incorporation into SOD1 revealing that under these conditions copper is preferentially incorporated into the preformed apoSOD1 pool (Fig. 3, A and B). To further test this concept, CCS+/+ fibroblasts were preincubated with excess copper, followed by pulse labeling with 64Cu in the absence or presence of cycloheximide. Quantitative analysis revealed that 64Cu incorporation into SOD1 is linear with respect to the length of the pulse time in untreated cells but not in cycloheximide-treated cells, consistent with the concept that copper incorporation in occurs into both newly synthesized SOD1 and an intracellular pool of apoSOD1 (Fig. 3C). The above data suggest that at steady state a portion of cellular SOD1 consists of preformed apoprotein. To further address this issue, CCS+/+ and CCS–/– mice were injected with 64Cu and tissue lysates analyzed for 64Cu-SOD1 (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2), SOD1 oxidase activity (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4) and SOD1 protein (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6) following nonreducing, nondenaturing PAGE. When SOD1 was denatured in situ following transfer to nitrocellulose, two distinct SOD1 immunoreactive bands were identified in liver lysates from CCS+/+ mice, while only the more rapidly migrating band was observed in identical lysates from CCS–/– animals (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6). The upper band migrates in the identical position as enzymatically active, 64Cu-SOD1 while the lower band is only observed under conditions where SOD1 is copper-free and enzymatically inactive, suggesting that these two SOD1 species correspond to holo and apo SOD1 respectively. Consistent with this concept, equivalent amounts of SOD1 were detected in liver lysates from CCS+/+ and CCS–/– mice when analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6, lower panel marked SOD1). Furthermore, identical results were observed in all tissues from these mice and both bands were eliminated by prior incubation with multiple different antisera specific to SOD1 (data not shown). Similar findings were observed in HepG2 cells following pretreatment with TEPA, where copper chelation resulted in abrogation of SOD1 activity and resultant conversion of the immunodetectable SOD1 under nondenaturing conditions to the more rapidly migrating band corresponding to apoSOD1 (Fig. 4B). As was observed in the murine experiments above, the amount of SOD1 in these cells was equivalent when examined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4B), supporting the concept that the differences in SOD1 mobility and abundance observed under nondenaturing conditions reflect conformational changes related to copper incorporation into this protein. To determine the reason for this observed difference in electrophoretic mobility of holo and apoSOD1, purified human SOD1 was treated with 6 m guanidine followed by analysis for SOD1 dismutase activity, total SOD1 protein and holo and apoSOD1 as above. Initially, purified SOD1 existed in equilibrium between these two species (Fig. 4C, lane 1), with holo and apoSOD1 migrating in the identical position as observed in HepG2 cells following copper chelation (Fig. 4C, lanes 5 and 6). Over time, guanidine denaturation progressively decreased the abundance of holoSOD1 with a concomitant increase in apoSOD1 associated with the progressive loss of oxidase activity (Fig. 4C, lanes 2–4). Although these methods allow for the detection of apo and holoSOD1, it is important to note that the signal observed following denaturation SOD1 in situ is not quantitative. This is apparent when examining the differences in the amounts of apo and holoSOD1 detected with this technique versus total SOD1 determined following reducing, SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4B). Such differences likely reflect incomplete denaturation with the in situ technique as the SOD1 antisera does not detect native SOD1. Nevertheless, the methodology clearly demonstrates the presence of both apo and holoSOD1 in the tissue and cell lysates and reveals that the abundance of each species is directly related to the copper content. Importantly, in these experiments, as with the 64Cu studies, the terms apo and holoSOD1 refer only to the observations on copper incorporation, as zinc metallation is not able to be examined under these circumstances. Nevertheless, the requirement of zinc for SOD1 activity suggests that the holoSOD1 observed here represents SOD1 with both copper and zinc. These findings suggest that under steady state conditions SOD1 exists in the cell as both apo and holoprotein and that the equilibrium of these two species is directly dependent upon the availability of intracellular copper provided by the metallochaperone CCS. Although numerous in vitro studies have revealed that SOD1 exists as a stable homodimer, it is uncertain if this is the case in vivo for both the holo and apo forms and it is unclear which species is the target for interaction with CCS. To directly examine these questions, the molecular mass of SOD1 was determined by gel filtration chromatography of liver lysates from CCS+/+ and CCS–/– mice. As can be seen in Fig. 5A, this analysis revealed that SOD1 exists as a homodimer in both CCS+/+ and CCS–/– liver lysates with an elution profile similar to that for purified erythrocyte human SOD1. Although immunoblot analysis following SDS-PAGE revealed that SOD1 eluted in equivalent amounts and in the identical fractions in both samples (Fig. 5A), the fractions from CCS–/– lysates was devoid of SOD1 oxidase and contained only apoSOD1 when analyzed following nondenaturing, nonreducing PAGE (data not shown), confirming that apoSOD1 from these cells had not acquired copper during the chromatography. As SOD1 was not detected in any other elution fractions, these findings indicate that the conformational differences in holo and apoSOD1 observed above are not sufficient to result in separation of these two species during chromatography. Therefore, the identical elution pattern of SOD1 from CCS+/+ and CCS–/– liver lysates, taken together with the 64Cu incorporation data (Fig. 2A), indicates that holo and apoSOD1 must exist as homodimers in vivo. The abundance of SOD1 appeared identical in liver lysates from CCS+/+ and CCS–/– mice and consistent with this, pulse-chase analysis in embryonic fibroblasts derived from these animals revealed equivalent half-lives of SOD1, indicating that neither CCS nor copper incorporation has an essential role in the stability or turnover of SOD1 in vivo (Fig. 5B). The data in this study reveal a striking rapidity to the kinetics of copper incorporation into SOD1. Indeed, the time course of the pulse and pulse-chase experiments indicate that, following uptake, copper is immediately delivered to SOD1 with no equilibration into an intermediate pool of free copper (Fig. 1, A and B) and that this is entirely dependent upon the copper chaperone CCS (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these findings suggest that a pool of free copper ions is not used in the physiological activation of cuproenzymes in mammalian cells. The requirement for CCS in this process supports the hypothesis that copper chaperones function to protect copper from intracellular scavenging while ensuring that this metal is available for specific intracellular proteins (3Rae T.D.

Although the mechanisms of copper delivery to CCS are not known, recent studies indicate that high affinity copper uptake requires copper-stimulated endocytosis of plasma membrane Ctr1 (21Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Given the kinetics observed in this current study, these observations suggest the possibility for direct interaction of Ctr1 and CCS with copper transfer within this endocytosed compartment. The results shown here also indicate that, once incorporated into SOD1, copper is unavailable for cellular exchange, turning over with a half-life identical to that for the protein (Fig. 1D). These data are consistent with previous observations on ceruloplasmin (20Hellman N.E. Kono S. Mancini G.M. Hoogeboom A.J. De Jong G.J. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46632-46638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and suggest no role for SOD1 in the specific delivery or trafficking of copper to other intracellular sites or tissues. Intriguingly however, the data do reveal that despite the continuous incorporation of copper into nascent SOD1 protein, a significant portion of SOD1 exists as apoSOD1 that can be rapidly converted to holoprotein (Fig. 2). Given the abundance of this intracellular protein, the finding that this incorporated copper is not exchangeable raises the possibility that this apoSOD1 pool may serve in a buffering capacity in mammalian cells during periods of environmental or genetic copper toxicity. Indeed, previous studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have suggested that SOD1 may have such a function in the homeostasis of copper, as deletion of SOD1 in this organisms confers an increased sensitivity toward this metal that is unrelated to superoxide dismutase activity (22Culotta V.C. Joh H.-D. Lin S.-J. Slekar K.H. Strain J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29991-29997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). While it is unclear if copper is reutilized following SOD1 turnover or trafficked directly to pathways for cellular efflux, it is apparent that incorporated copper has no effect on the abundance or half-life of SOD1 (Fig. 5, A and B). Taken together with recent findings indicating that the abundance of CCS is inversely proportional to nutritional copper status (23Bertinato J. Iskandar M. L'Abbe M.R. J. Nutrit. 2003; 133: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), these observations indicate regulation at the level of copper delivery to SOD1, rather than following protein turnover, a finding consistent with a role for SOD1 in copper homeostasis under situations of copper overload. The rapid and specific incorporation of copper into SOD1 observed in this study suggested that copper may activate a preexisting pool of apoSOD and the biochemical data directly demonstrate this pool, revealing that the abundance of apoSOD1 is inversely proportional to the intracellular copper content (Fig. 4). These findings are consistent with previous observations in copper-deficient rats and differentiating K562 cells that implied the presence of such an apoSOD1 pool (24DiSilvestro R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Steinkühler C. Sapora O. Carri M.T. Nagel W. Marcocci L. Ciriolo M.R. Weser U. Rotilio G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24580-24587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with recent data indicating that CCS can activate SOD1 in yeast in the absence of new protein synthesis (12Schmidt P.J. Kuns C. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33771-33776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, direct assessment of copper incorporation into SOD1 indicates that under copper replete conditions ∼50% of newly arriving copper is incorporated into nascent SOD1 (Fig. 2) while under circumstances of copper deficiency copper is preferentially incorporated into the apoSOD1 pool (Fig. 3). These observations are consistent with previous work in human lymphocytes revealing that the incorporation of copper into SOD1 is partially inhibited by cycloheximide under conditions of increased intracellular copper content (26Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28335-28340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The finding that copper incorporation into nascent SOD1 is dependent upon CCS (Fig. 2A), suggests a potential role for this chaperone in protein folding during copper incorporation, consistent with the differences in apo and holoSOD1 revealed during electrophoresis (Fig. 4C) as well as recent evidence that CCS disulfide isomerase and oxidase activity are required for the mechanism of copper insertion into SOD1. 3T. O'Halloran, personal communication. Taken together, the data in this study provide a cell biological model for the mechanisms of SOD1 synthesis in mammalian cells. In addition to copper, zinc ions play a critical role in the stability and function of active SOD1. While there are currently no similar methods to assess zinc incorporation into SOD1, recent studies indicate that CCS preferentially incorporates copper into the reduced, apo but zinc metallated form of SOD1. 3T. O'Halloran, personal communication. Given the kinetics of CCS-dependent copper incorporation observed in this current study, these observations suggest that the incorporation of zinc into SOD1 must occur with similarly rapid and specific mechanisms. The findings reported here also reveal another aspect of SOD1 synthesis that may be critical in the regulation of cellular antioxidant activity. Recent studies have shown that a fraction of active SOD1 localizes within the mitochondrial intermembrane space in both yeast and rodents, protecting this organelle from oxidative damage arising from any superoxide entering or produced in this compartment (28Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38388-3839330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both CCS and SOD1 are localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and the abundance of active SOD1 in this compartment is dependent upon this chaperone (28Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although neither CCS nor SOD1 contain typical N-terminal presequences for mitochondrial uptake, recent data indicate that it is the apo, reduced form of SOD1 that is taken up by mitochondria (30Field L.S. Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta VC. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (187) Google Scholar), indicating that the intracellular availability of apoSOD1 is a critical factor in antioxidant protection in this organelle. As mitochondria are the major source of superoxide in mammalian cells (29Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38388-3839330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), understanding the mechanisms that determine the synthesis, abundance and localization of cellular apoSOD1 as well as the factors effecting interaction with and activation by CCS will be critical in elucidation of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of antioxidant defense. The findings reported here also have important implications for our understanding of the cellular pathogenesis of motor neuron degeneration in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) due to autosomal dominantly inherited mutations in SOD1 (31Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 2: 806-819Crossref Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that while these SOD1 mutants vary considerably with respect to activity, polypeptide half-life and resistance to proteolysis these variables do not correlate with disease onset or progression (32Ratovitski T. Corson L.B. Strain J. Wong P. Cleveland D.W. Culotta V.C. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although CCS has been shown to directly interact with several of these mutants (9Casareno R.L.B. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), recent data have shown that this metallochaperone plays no role in the pathogenesis of motor neuron disease in specific mouse models of FALS (33Subramaniam J.R. Lyons W.E. Liu J. Bartnikas T.B. Rothstein J. Price D.L. Cleveland D.W. Gitlin J.D. Wong P.C. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the biology of the apoSOD1 pool observed in this current study for wild-type SOD1 is likely the predominant factor affected by these mutations. This concept is consistent with recent findings demonstrating that regardless of the specific mutation, oligomerization of mutant SOD1 appears to be important in the toxicity of these proteins (34Valentine J.S. Hart H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3617-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and with the observation that impaired mitochondrial uptake of mutant apoSOD1 results in aberrant utilization of heat shock proteins and cell death (35Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9010-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Further study of the mechanisms of wild-type and mutant apoSOD1 accumulation, trafficking and turnover will likely bring useful information in devising novel therapeutic approaches in this disease.

In this study, we identified GTP-14564 as a specific kinase inhibitor for ITD-FLT3 and investigated the molecular basis of its specificity. GTP-14564 inhibited the growth of interleukin-3-independent Ba/F3 expressing ITD-FLT3 at 1 μm, whereas a 30-fold higher concentration of GTP-14564 was required to inhibit FLT3 ligand-dependent growth of Ba/F3 expressing wild type FLT3 (wt-FLT3). However, this inhibitor suppressed the kinase activities of wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3 equally, suggesting that the signaling pathways for proliferation differ between wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3. Analysis of downstream targets of FLT3 using GTP-14564 revealed STAT5 activation to be essential for growth signaling of ITD-FLT3. In contrast, wt-FLT3 appeared to mainly use the MAPK pathway rather than the STAT5 pathway to transmit a proliferative signal. Further analysis demonstrated that the first two tyrosines in an ITD were critical for STAT5 activation and growth induction but that all of the tyrosines in the juxtamembrane region were dispensable in terms of the proliferation signals of wt-FLT3. These results indicate that an ITD mutation in FLT3 elicits an aberrant STAT5 activation that results in increased sensitivity to GTP-14564.

Also found in 7% of AML patients were activating mutations at aspartic acid 835 (Asp-835) in the kinase domain of FLT3; mutations are also associated with a poor prognosis (12Yamamoto Y. Kiyoi H.

Both types of FLT3 mutations result in constitutive activation of FLT3 kinase activity and induce autonomous proliferation of factor-dependent hematopoietic cell lines (13Hayakawa F. Towatari M.

Targeted inhibition of a mutant tyrosine kinase might be an attractive therapeutic strategy for hematological malignancies, just as the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 has been effectively used for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia harboring gain-of-function mutations in the c-ABL tyrosine kinase (15Druker B.J. Lydon N.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 16Druker B.J. Talpaz M. Resta D.J. Peng B. Buchdunger E. Ford J.M. Lydon N.B. Kantarjian H. Capdeville R.

Thus, FLT3 is considered to be a rational target for therapeutic intervention aimed at the commonly mutated gene in AML. For this purpose, we screened a small molecular compound library and identified 11 compounds that preferentially inhibited the autonomous growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing ITD-FLT3 (BaF/ITD-FLT3), as compared with Ba/F3 cells expressing wild type FLT3 (BaF/wt-FLT3). Among them, GTP-14564 had the most potent and specific inhibitory activity against BaF/ITD-FLT3. GTP-14564 inhibited the growth of BaF/ITD-FLT3 at 1 μm, whereas a 30-fold higher concentration of GTP-14564 was required for the inhibition of BaF/wt-FLT3 growth. We anticipated that the difference in sensitivity to GTP-14564 between BaF/wt-FLT3 and BaF/ITD-FLT3 was caused by more potent suppression of the kinase activity of ITD-FLT3 than that of wt-FLT3 by GTP-14564. However, we found that GTP-14564 inhibited the kinase activities of wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3 equally. This raises the possibility that the selective cytotoxic potency of GTP-14564 is due to differences in growth signaling mechanisms between BaF/wt-FLT3 and BaF/ITD-FLT3. To clarify the molecular basis of the selective cytotoxicity of GTP-14564, we analyzed the signaling pathways down-stream from wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3.

The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 and anti-phospho MAPK antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and Promega, respectively. Cells—A mouse pro-B cell line, Ba/F3, was maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1 ng/ml mIL-3. Ba/F3 cells expressing c-kit or PDGFRβ were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 1 ng/ml mIL-3, and 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Human leukemia cell lines, including Jurkat, K562, HL-60, THP-1, and MOLM13, were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS. Murine myeloid leukemia M-NFS-60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS and 100 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor (18Nakoinz I. Lee M.-T. Weaver J.F. Ralph P. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 860-864PubMed Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells expressing human kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)/Flk-1 were maintained as described (19Takahashi T. Shibuya M.

Construction of FLT3 Expression Vectors and the Establishment of Ba/F3 Transfectants Expressing wt-FLT3 or ITD-FLT3—Complementary DNAs encoding human wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3 were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pMKITNeo containing a neomycin resistance gene and electroporated into Ba/F3 cells using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). ITD-FLT3 was derived from patients' leukemic cells harboring a 20-amino acid tandem duplication called M3 (8Yokota S. Kiyoi H. Nakao M. Iwai T. Misawa S. Okuda T. Sonoda Y. Abe T. Kashima K. Matsuo Y. Naoe T. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 1605-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). These cells were selected in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml G418 for 2 weeks to establish BaF/wt-FLT3 and BaF/ITD-FLT3. An SspI site and an AvrII site were introduced upstream and downstream from the ITD domain, respectively, without introducing changes in the amino acid sequence. Using these sites and synthesized oligonucleotides, various combinations of tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations were introduced into wt-FLT3 or ITD-FLT3. Ba/F3 transfectants expressing wt-FLT3 or ITD-FLT3 as well as their mutants were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS and 1 ng/ml mIL-3 in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml G418 unless otherwise specified, except that BaF/ITD-FLT3 was maintained in the absence of mIL-3. Cell Growth Assay—Cell growth was evaluated by a colorimetric assay using an Alamar Blue solution (21Ahmed S.A. Gogal Jr., R. Walsh J.E. J. Immunol.

Cell-based assays were performed by analyzing the effects of GTP-14564 on receptor autophosphorylation induced by ligand stimulation. Briefly, cells were incubated for 2 h in various concentrations of the inhibitor prior to stimulation with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (100 ng/ml), stem cell factor (100 ng/ml), vascular endothelial growth factor (10 ng/ml), or PDGF-BB (100 ng/ml) for 5 min, respectively. Equal amounts of protein of cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested as explained in each figure legend, and immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described (22Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L.-F. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The filter bound antibody was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). A Retrovirus Vector Expressing the Dominant Negative STAT5A— The dominant negative STAT5A (dnSTAT5A) missing its C terminus (33Moriggl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jahne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotiropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) was inserted into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the pMX-internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (34Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L.-F. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) to generate pMX-dnSTAT5A-IRES-GFP. This vector was transfected into Plat-E (20Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar) to obtain the viruses using FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Screening of ITD-FLT3-specific Inhibitors—To develop a screening assay for identifying ITD-FLT3-specific inhibitors, we generated indicator cells by introducing wt-FLT3 or ITD-FLT3 into IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells. The resulting transfectants, BaF/wt-FLT3 and BaF/ITD-FLT3, expressed equivalent levels of FLT3 (data not shown). BaF/wt-FLT3 proliferated in the presence of FL, whereas BaF/ITD-FLT3 showed factor-independent growth. Using a colorimetric assay for cell proliferation, we screened a library of small molecular compounds and identified 11 compounds that inhibited the growth of BaF/ITD-FLT3 at concentrations lower than those required for inhibition of FL-driven growth of BaF/wt-FLT3. Among these 11 compounds, GTP-14564 (Fig. 1) had the most potent and specific inhibitory effect on BaF/ITD-FLT3 cells. GTP-14564 is a compound originally synthesized to demonstrate a protocol for synthesizing chemicals (35Gatta F. Settimj G. J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1984; 21: 937-943Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and is available from SPECS and BioSPECS BV, Inc. (Rijswijk, Netherlands) under the name 1-phenyl-3-H-8-oxa-2,3-diaza-cyclopenta[a]inden. It has three conjugated rings sharing structural characteristics with the part of staurosporine that inhibits protein kinase C by competing for ATP. Selective Kinase Inhibition by GTP-14564 —The ability of GTP-14564 to inhibit exogenous substrate phosphorylation or receptor autophosphorylation was tested against a wide range of kinases. The concentration of GTP-14564 resulting in a 50% reduction of kinase activity or a 50% reduction in the phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinase (IC50) was reported in Table I. GTP-14564 inhibited members of class III RTKs including FLT3, c-Fms, c-Kit, and PDGFRβ with IC50 values of 0.3–1.0 μm as assessed in cell-based assays. In contrast, GTP-14564 did not significantly inhibit other protein kinases tested in this study, including kinase insert domain-containing receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and intracellular kinases such as Src, protein kinase C, and ERKs. These studies demonstrated that GTP-14564 is a potent and specific inhibitor of class III RTKs.Table IProfile of inhibition of protein kinases by GTP-14564Protein kinaseSubstrate phosphorylation IC50Cellular tyrosine phosphorylation IC50μ mμ mPDGFRβ1c-Fms0.3c-Kit0.3FLT30.3ITD-FLT30.3KDR>10EGFR>10HER2>10ERK1>10ERK2>10MEK1>10Src>10Abl>10PKA>10PKC>10AKT>10 Open table in a new tab GTP-14564 Specifically Inhibits ITD-FLT3-driven Cell Growth—To evaluate the selective cytotoxicity of GTP-14564 against ITD-FLT3, we tested the effects of GTP-14564 on the proliferation of BaF/wt-FLT3, BaF/ITD-FLT3, and parental Ba/F3 cells. Also included in this experiment was a Ba/F3 transfectant expressing a kinase-active mutant of FLT3 with a Asp-835 to Val mutation (BaF/D835V-FLT3). This mutant also induced autonomous growth in Ba/F3 cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, GTP-14564 inhibited the proliferation of BaF/ITD-FLT3 at 1 μm. On the other hand, a 30-fold higher concentration of GTP-14564 was needed to inhibit FL-dependent growth of BaF/wt-FLT3. The sensitivity of BaF/D835V-FLT3 to GTP-14564 was intermediate, i.e. between those of BaF/ITD-FLT3 and BaF/wt-FLT3. We next examined the effects of GTP-14564 inhibition of FLT3 on the cell growth of several human leukemia cell lines. Among the cell lines tested, proliferation of MOLM13 expressing ITD-FLT3 (8Yokota S. Kiyoi H. Nakao M. Iwai T. Misawa S. Okuda T. Sonoda Y. Abe T. Kashima K. Matsuo Y. Naoe T. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 1605-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) was inhibited by 1 μm GTP-14564. However, other cell lines, including Jurkat, K562 expressing BCR-ABL, THP-1 expressing wt-FLT3, and HL-60, were resistant, requiring at least 300-fold higher concentrations of GTP-14564 (Fig. 2B). IL-3-driven proliferation of Ba/F3 cells was also resistant to GTP-14564 exposure (Fig. 2A). These results revealed GTP-14564 to be a specific inhibitor of ITD-FLT3. GTP-14564 Inhibits the Kinase Activities of Both wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3 with a Similar Efficiency—The above studies demonstrated that ITD-FLT3-expressing cells were more sensitive to GTP-14564 than wt-FLT3-expressing cells. Therefore, we tested whether GTP-14564 suppresses the kinase activity of ITD-FLT3 more efficiently than that of wt-FLT3 by using receptor autophosphorylation as an assay. To our surprise, we found that GTP-14564 suppressed the autophosphorylation of both wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3 equally at 0.3 μm (Fig. 3A), indicating that GTP14564 equally suppressed the kinase activities of wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3. These results raise the possibility that the selective growth inhibitory potency of GTP-14564 is due to a difference in signaling pathways between wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3. Therefore, we investigated the role of two representative signaling pathways, JAK/STAT and MAPK (36Tse K.F. Mukherjee G. Small D. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1766-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 37Zhang S. Fukuda S. Lee Y. Hangoc G. Cooper S. Spolski R. Leonard W.J. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), both of which are known to be important for cell proliferation, downstream from the wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3 receptors by using GTP-14564. ITD-FLT3 but Not wt-FLT3 Induces Tyk2 Activation in Ba/F3 Cells, an Event Indirectly Suppressed by GTP-14564 — Among members of the Janus kinase family, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2, but not JAK1, were expressed in Ba/F3 cells. Phosphorylation of JAK2 and JAK3 was not augmented by either wt-FLT3 or ITD-FLT3 (data not shown). Tyk2 was activated in BaF/ITD-FLT3 but not in BaF/wt-FLT3 even after FL stimulation. In addition, the activation of Tyk2 in BaF/ITD-FLT3 was inhibited by GTP-14564 (Fig. 3B). However, GTP-14564 inhibition of Tyk2 activation is likely to be indirect because of the following result. As we reported, Tyk2 is activated by TPO in Ba/F3 cells expressing TPO receptors (39Onishi M. Mui A.L.-F. Morikawa Y. Cho L. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Blood. 1996; 88: 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, neither this TPO-induced Tyk2 activation nor TPO-induced cell growth was inhibited by GTP-14564 (Fig. 3B). ITD-FLT3-induced STAT5 Activation Is More Sensitive to GTP-14564 than wt-FLT3-induced Activation—STAT5A was constitutively phosphorylated in BaF/ITD-FLT3 and was only activated in BaF/wt-FLT3 cells after factor starvation followed by stimulation with FL (Fig. 3C). The activation of STAT5A was inhibited by much lower concentrations of GTP-14564 in BaF/ITD-FLT3 as compared with findings with BaF/wt-FLT3 (Fig. 3C). Activation and inhibition of STAT5B were much the same as those of STAT5A (data not shown). It was reported previously that STAT5A, but not STAT5B, was activated by wt-FLT3 (37Zhang S. Fukuda S. Lee Y. Hangoc G. Cooper S. Spolski R. Leonard W.J. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, in our experiments the activation of both STAT5A and STAT5B by wt-FLT3 as well as ITD-FLT3 was detected by several STAT5A- or STAT5B-specific antibodies, including the one used in the previous study (data not shown). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that Zhang et al. tested STAT5 activation in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) but not in hematopoietic cells (37Zhang S. Fukuda S. Lee Y. Hangoc G. Cooper S. Spolski R. Leonard W.J. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was not augmented by either wt-FLT3 or ITD-FLT3 (data not shown). ERK1 and 2 Play Important Roles in wt-FLT3-driven but Not ITD-FLT3-driven Cell Growth—Activation of ERK1 and 2 was detected as phosphorylated bands in Western blot analysis in BaF/wt-FLT3 cells after factor deprivation followed by FL stimulation, and this activation was not suppressed by GTP-14564 (Fig. 4A). Activation of ERK1 and 2 was not evident in BaF/ITD-FLT3 cells. To evaluate the importance of ERK1 and 2 activation in growth signals of wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3, we tested the MEK inhibitor U0126 (17Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar) with regard to inhibition of the growth of these cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, although U0126 profoundly retarded the FL-dependent growth of BaF/wt-FLT3, it did not significantly affect the autonomous growth of BaF/ITD-FLT3. Although ERK1 and 2 are reportedly activated by ITD-FLT3 in Ba/F3 as well as another IL-3-dependent cell line, 32D (14Mizuki M. Fenski R. Halfter H. Matsumura I. Schmidt R. Muller C. Gruning W.

Ohno R. Saito H. Naoe T. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 1333-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), ITD-FLT3-driven activation of ERK1 and 2 was much weaker than wt-FLT3-driven activation, suggesting that ERKs were weakly activated but undetectable in our system. We obtained a similar result in an experiment using another MEK inhibitor, PD98059 (25Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Activation of STAT5 Is a Prerequisite for Growth Signals Induced by ITD-FLT3—We and others reported previously that C-terminal truncated mutants of STAT5 worked as dominant negative forms (33Moriggl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jahne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotiropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 41Mui A.L.-F. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2245-2433Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of STAT5 is critical for growth signals delivered by ITD-FLT3, we expressed dnSTAT5A (33Moriggl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jahne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotiropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) in BaF/wt-FLT3 and BaF/ITD-FLT3 by using a bicistronic retrovirus vector, pMX-IRES-GFP (34Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L.-F. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). One day after the transduction of pMX-dnSTAT5A-IRES-GFP, BaF/wt-FLT3 and BaF/ITD-FLT3 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of FL, respectively, and GFP-positive cells (i.e. cells expressing wt-FLT3 or ITD-FLT3) were counted at indicated time intervals to evaluate the growth inhibitory effects of dnSTAT5 (Fig. 5). The cell growth was not affected by the transduction of the blank vector pMX-IRES-GFP, thus serving as a negative control. Factor-independent growth of BaF/ITD-FLT3 was profoundly suppressed by the expression of dnSTAT5A (Fig. 5B), whereas FL-dependent growth of BaF/wt-FLT3 was not significantly affected by the expression of dnSTAT5A (Fig. 5A). These results demonstrate that STAT5 activation is essential for cell growth signals delivered by ITD-FLT3. Tyrosine Residues of ITD-FLT3 Are Required for STAT5 Activation and Cell Proliferation—To further confirm the importance of STAT5 activation in ITD-FLT3-driven cell growth, we generated a series of ITD-FLT3 mutants harboring phenylalanine instead of tyrosine in various combinations in the ITD domain (ITD-YF mutants) (Fig. 6A). Using these ITD-YF mutants, we attempted to relate phosphorylation of particular tyrosine residues to STAT5 activation and growth induction. When all tyrosines in the ITD region were replaced by phenylalanines, this mutant receptor, FFFFFFFF (designated F8 in Fig. 6), no longer activated STAT5 nor did it induce autonomous growth of Ba/F3 cells (Fig. 6B). To identify the tyrosine residue required for STAT5 activation and growth induction, we further tested the potentials of various ITD-YF mutants to induce STAT5 activation and cell growth. Although the FFFFYYYY mutant (F4Y4 in Fig. 6) in which the first four tyrosines were replaced by phenylalanines was not able to activate STAT5, the YYYYFFFF (Y4F4 in Fig. 6) mutant in which the latter four tyrosines were replaced by phenylalanines did activate STAT5 (Fig. 6B). The YYFFFFFF mutant (Y2F6 in Fig. 6), but not the FFYYFFFF mutant of ITD-FLT3 (F2Y2F4 in Fig. 6), activated STAT5, thus indicating that the first two tyrosines are critical for STAT5 activation. We also found that one of these tyrosines was adequate to induce STAT5 activation, albeit weakly, in an experiment using the YFFFFFFF mutant (YF7 in Fig. 6) or the FYFFFFFF mutant (FYF6 in Fig. 6) in which the first or the second tyrosine was retained, respectively. The potential to activate STAT5 correlated well with the potential to induce autonomous cell proliferation in a series of ITD-YF mutants, thereby confirming the importance of STAT5 activation in ITD-FLT3-induced cell growth. On the other hand, the FFFF mutant (F4 in Fig. 6) of wt-FLT3 in which all four tyrosines in the juxtamembrane domain of wt-FLT3 were replaced by phenylalanines did not induce STAT5 activation but did induce cell growth in the presence of FL, albeit weakly (Fig. 6B). Activation of ERK1 and 2 by FL was observed in both BaF/wt-FLT3 and Ba/F3 cells expressing the F4 mutant of wt-FLT3 (Fig. 4A, and data not shown). These results suggested that, unlike ITD-FLT3, the MAPK pathway was indispensable and the STAT5 pathway was dispensable for wt-FLT3 growth signals. In a search for inhibitors of the oncogenic mutant of FLT3, we developed a screening assay in which two model cell lines were used as indicators. One cell line is BaF/wt-FLT3, which proliferates in the presence of FL, and the other is BaF/ITD-FLT3, which shows autonomous cell growth. Using these two lines, we identified a novel kinase inhibitor, GTP-14564, that has both efficacy and selectivity for ITD-FLT3. Although GTP-14564 has a stronger effect on ITD-FLT3 than on its wild type counterpart, the kinase activities of wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3 were equally suppressed by GTP-14564, suggesting that the selective cytotoxicity of GTP-14564 depended on the difference in the growth signals delivered by wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3. Multiple pathways, including JAK/STAT and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, have been implicated in FLT3 signaling (36Tse K.F. Mukherjee G. Small D. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1766-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 37Zhang S. Fukuda S. Lee Y. Hangoc G. Cooper S. Spolski R. Leonard W.J. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To clarify the molecular mechanism underlying the selective inhibition of ITD-FLT3-driven cell growth by GTP-14564, we compared signaling molecules downstream of wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3 and their sensitivities to GTP-14564. Herein we present considerable evidence for the critical roles of STAT5 activation in ITD-FLT3-driven, but not wt-FLT3-driven, cell growth. A 30-fold higher concentration of GTP-14564 was required to inhibit STAT5 activation in BaF/wt-FLT3 than in BaF/ITD-FLT3. This difference is consistent with the difference in sensitivities of BaF/ITD-FLT3 and BaF/wt-FLT3 to GTP-14564 in growth suppression. Of greatest importance is the observation that cell proliferation induced by ITD-FLT3, but not wt-FLT3, was dramatically inhibited by dnSTAT5. In addition, the two tyrosine residues at the N terminus of the intracellular domain of ITD-FLT3 were required for STAT5 activation as well as for the induction of cell growth. On the other hand, the MEK inhibitor U0126 preferentially inhibited wt-FLT3-driven cell proliferation as compared with ITD-FLT3-driven cell proliferation, indicating important roles for the MAPK pathway in growth signaling induced by wt-FLT3. We also found that all of the tyrosine residues in the juxtamembrane domain of wt-FLT3 were dispensable for FL-stimulated cell growth; the FFFF mutant of wt-FLT3 induced FL-dependent growth without detectable activation of STAT5. Moreover, activation of ERK1 and 2 mediated by FL-stimulated wt-FLT3 was not inhibited by GTP-14564 at 3 μm, which suppressed STAT5 activation at much lower concentrations. These findings further support the concept that the proliferative signal through wt-FLT3 mainly depends on the activation of MAPK rather than STAT5. It is obvious that activation of both pathways is required for full stimulation of FL-dependent cell growth. Tyk2 was activated by ITD-FLT3 but not wt-FLT3, and this activation was inhibited by GTP-14564. The inhibition of Tyk2 by GTP-14564 was not direct, because GTP-14564 did not inhibit the TPO-induced activation of Tyk2 in the same Ba/F3 cells. Thus, GTP-14564 probably suppressed Tyk2 activation by inhibiting an upstream molecule, most likely ITD-FLT3. It is possible that ITD-FLT3 either activates STAT5 indirectly, through Tyk2 activation, or activates STAT5 directly, independently of Tyk2 activation. It was reported that Tyk2 activation induced cell growth through STAT5 activation (42Mizuguchi R. Hatakeyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32297-32303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To test whether Tyk2 is involved in ITD-FLT3-mediated cell growth through STAT5 activation, it is required to examine whether a dominant negative form of Tyk2 suppresses FLT3-driven STAT5 activation and cell growth. To date, however, an efficient dominant negative form of Tyk2 has not been available. Kelly et al. recently reported that ITD-FLT3 induced myeloproliferative disease in a murine bone marrow transplant model (43Kelly L.M. Liu Q. Kutok J.L. Williams I.R. Boulton C.L. Gilliland D.G. Blood. 2002; 99: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). We are currently setting up a mouse leukemia model in which ITD-FLT3 is transduced into bone marrow progenitor cells of either normal mice or tyk2 gene-disrupted mice to determine whether Tyk2 plays critical roles in leukemogenesis induced by ITD-FLT3. Another receptor, PDGFR, a member of class III RTK family, was reported to induce phosphorylation of JAK and activation of STAT (44Vignais M.-L. Sadowski H.B. Watling D. Rogers N.C. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1759-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, PDGFR is not expressed in BaF3 cells and is obviously not involved in the ITD-FLT3 signal shown here. Alternatively, some cytoplasmic kinases such as c-Src may have mediated ITD-FLT3-driven phosphorylation of STAT5. Therefore, it is most likely that GTP-14564 inhibition of STAT5 activation and cell growth is due to the suppression of ITD-FLT3 by GTP-14564, because Tyk2 and c-Src are not the direct targets of GTP-14564. Several other FLT3 inhibitors, including AG1295, CEP-701, CT53518, and PKC412, have been reported to inhibit the ITD-FLT3-driven proliferation of leukemic cells and transfectants expressing ITD-FLT3 (40Weisberg E.

CEP-701, CT5318, and PKC412 have proved to be effective for mouse leukemia model induced by ITD-FLT3. However, whether these inhibitors were more effective on ITD-FLT3 than on wt-FLT3 is not known. As shown in this report, GTP-14564 is more effective on ITD and kinase-active mutants of FLT3 than on wt-FLT3. This is an important point when one think about the side effect of molecular targeted therapy. We also revealed the molecular basis underlying the specificity of GTP-14564 on the mutants of FLT3. Thus, constitutive activation of STAT5 plays a crucial role in ITD-FLT3-driven growth signals, and dnSTAT5 significantly suppressed cell proliferation mediated by ITD-FLT3, thus leading to the notion that STAT5 activation in ITD-FLT3 enhances sensitivity to GTP-14564. In conclusion, we have identified GTP-14564, a novel potent and specific kinase inhibitor for ITD-FLT3. In the course of our study, with the aim of clarifying the selective cytotoxicity of GTP-14564, we identified differences in signaling pathways driven by wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3 for cell growth (Fig. 7). Activation of STAT5 plays a major role in ITD-FLT3-stimulated autonomous cell growth, whereas activation of ERK1 and 2 was shown to be more important in wt-FLT3-stimulated cell growth of Ba/F3 cells (Fig. 7). We propose that ITD mutation in the FLT3 receptor causes strong and constitutive STAT5 activation and that GTP-14564 preferentially inhibits ITD-FLT3-induced cell proliferation, because ITD-FLT3-driven STAT5 activation is more sensitive to the inhibitor than is wt-FLT3-driven activation. Therefore, an FLT3-targeted inhibitor strategy with the potential for selective cytotoxicity, such as GTP-14564, is a promising treatment strategy for AML patients harboring ITD-FLT3. We thank Dr. O. Rosnet, Dr. T. Naoe for wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3 cDNAs, Dr. S. Akinaga for the kind help with kinase assays, and M. Ohara for excellent language assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2168108433,"Cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are thought to form by assembly of two different subunit types, CNGA3 and CNGB3. Recently, mutations in the gene encoding the CNGB3 subunit have been linked to achromatopsia in humans. Here we describe the functional consequences of two achromatopsia-associated mutations in human CNGB3 (hCNGB3). Co-expression in Xenopus oocytes of human CNGA3 (hCNGA3) subunits with hCNGB3 subunits containing an achromatopsia-associated mutation in the S6 transmembrane domain (S435F) generated functional heteromeric channels that exhibited an increase in apparent affinity for both cAMP and cGMP compared with wild type heteromeric channels. In contrast, co-expression of a presumptive null mutation of hCNGB3 (T383f.s.ΔC) with hCNGA3 produced channels with properties indistinguishable from homomeric hCNGA3 channels. The effect of hCNGB3 S435F subunits on cell-surface expression of green fluorescent protein-tagged hCNGA3 subunits and of non-tagged hCNGA3 subunits on surface expression of green fluorescent protein-hCNGB3 S435F subunits were similar to those observed for wild type hCNGB3 subunits, suggesting that the mutation does not grossly disturb subunit assembly or plasma membrane targeting. The S435F mutation was also found to produce changes in the pore properties of the channel, including decreased single channel conductance and decreased sensitivity to block by l-cis-diltiazem. Overall, these results suggest that the functional properties of cone CNG channels may be altered in patients with the S435F mutation, providing evidence supporting the pathogenicity of this mutation in humans. Thus, achromatopsia may arise from a disturbance of cone CNG channel gating and permeation or from the absence of functional CNGB3 subunits.

Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) 1The abbreviations used are: CNG channel, cyclic nucleotide-gated channel; GFP, green fluorescent protein; h-, human; cNMP, 3′, 5′-cycle nucleotide monophosphate. ion channels are fundamental to sensory transduction in retinal photoreceptor cells and in olfactory receptor neurons. CNG channels couple a change in intracellular cyclic nucleotide concentration in these cells into an electrical response underlying sensory signaling. CNG channels are part of a superfamily of ion channels whose members include voltage-gated potassium channels and channels gated by intracellular ligands (1Zagotta W.N. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 235-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 2Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 769-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). There are six genes encoding CNG channel subunits in mammals: CNGA1, CNGA2, CNGA3, CNGA4, CNGB1, and CNGB3. Native CNG channels are thought to be tetrameric proteins formed by at least two of these subunit types. Each of these subunits exhibits six putative transmembrane domains, intracellular amino and carboxyl termini, a conserved pore domain, and a cyclic nucleotide binding domain. In cone photoreceptor cells, CNG channels are composed of CNGA3 (α) and CNGB3 (β) subunits. Similar to their rod photoreceptor counterparts, heterologous expression of CNGA3 subunits alone can generate functional homomeric channels (3Bonigk W. Altenhofen W. Muller F. Dose A. Illing M.

Compared with the proteins forming rod and olfactory CNG channels, the protein subunits forming cone photoreceptor CNG channels are not as well characterized; only recently has the molecular identity of the cone CNG channel β subunit been revealed (6Gerstner A.

Achromatopsia is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by absent or limited cone function (but intact rod function), compromised visual acuity, nystagmus, and photophobia. For CNGA3-deficient mice, an animal model of complete achromatopsia, loss of cone function correlates with progressive degeneration of cone photoreceptors (13Biel M. Seeliger M. Pfeifer A. Kohler K. Gerstner A. Ludwig A. Jaissle G. Fauser S. Zrenner E. Hofmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7553-7557Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Complete achromatopsia in humans, however, is thought to be a stationary disorder without obvious cone degeneration (but see also Ref. 14Eksandh L. Kohl S. Wissinger B. Ophthalmic Genet. 2002; 23: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One disease-associated mutation in humans (S435F), located in the putative S6 transmembrane domain of CNGB3, has been linked to the unusually frequent occurrence of complete achromatopsia among Pingelapese islanders (8Sundin O.H. Yang J.M. Li Y. Zhu D. Hurd J.N. Mitchell T.N. Silva E.D. Maumenee I.H. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 9Kohl S. Baumann B. Broghammer M. Jagle H. Sieving P.

Knopf, New York1997Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying achromatopsia remain poorly defined. An important step toward understanding the development of the disease is determining how individual mutations in the genes that encode cone photoreceptor CNG channel subunits may alter the functional properties of these critical proteins. Here we report the functional consequences of two mutations in hCNGB3 associated with achromatopsia in humans. Our results demonstrate that co-expression of hCNGA3 with hCNGB3 subunits containing an achromatopsia-associated frameshift mutation that truncates the pore and the carboxylterminal cytoplasmic domain (T383f.s.ΔC) gave rise to channels indistinguishable from homomeric hCNGA3 channels. We also show that S435F in hCNGB3 alters both the ligand sensitivity and pore properties of heteromeric cone CNG channels. These results imply that achromatopsia can arise either from altered functional properties of cone CNG channels or from the absence of working hCNGB3 subunits. Furthermore, the effect of the S435F mutation on the properties of heteromeric channels provides insight into both the structural features important for the activation of these channels and the molecular mechanisms leading to achromatopsia in humans. Molecular Biology—The human retinal cone CNG channel β subunit clone, hCNGB3, was isolated from human retinal cDNA as previously described (7Peng C. Rich E.D. Thor C.A. Varnum M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24617-24623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of this clone differs from the complete published sequence for CNGB3 of Kohl et al. (9Kohl S. Baumann B. Broghammer M. Jagle H. Sieving P. Kellner U. Spegal R. Anastasi M. Zrenner E. Sharpe L.T. Wissinger B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (AF272900) at two positions (nucleotide 1789g→a and nucleotide 1834a→g), representing either sequence polymorphisms or Taq polymerase errors; neither nucleotide change alters the amino acid sequence. It was subcloned into pGEMHE (16Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar) for heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. Human CNGA3 (4Yu W.P. Grunwald M.E. Yau K.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), a generous gift of Dr. K.-W. Yau, was also subcloned into pGEMHE. To generate amino-terminal fusions of enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) with hCNGB3 and hCNGA3, PCR-amplified GFP (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) including an additional linker sequence (IAG5RARLPA) was subcloned in-frame with cDNA encoding hCNGA3 and hCNGB3 at amino acids Asp-24 and Gly-107, respectively. The essential properties of hCNGA3 and hCNGB3 plus hCNGA3 channels were unaltered by the GFP fusion (data not shown). Although the GFP tag may still have a slight influence on expression level or plasma membrane targeting, we estimate that the effect of the tag on expression level (patch current density) is small. Mutations in the hCNGB3 coding sequence were engineered using overlapping PCR mutagenesis (17Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). All mutations and the fidelity of PCR-amplified cassettes were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. For expression studies, identical amounts of cDNA were linearized using SphI or NheI, and capped mRNA was transcribed in vitro using the T-7 RNA polymerase mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). mRNA concentrations and relative amounts were determined by denaturing gel electrophoresis and one-dimensional image analysis software (Kodak, NY) and spectrophotometry. Electrophysiology—For functional expression studies, Xenopus laevis oocytes were isolated and microinjected with 5–10 ng of mRNA as previously described (18Varnum M.D. Black K.D. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 1995; 15: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The ratio of wild type or mutant hCNGB3 mRNA to hCNGA3 mRNA was typically 5:1. Two to 7 days after microinjection of mRNA, patch-clamp experiments were performed in the inside-out configuration with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Recordings were made at 20–23 °C. Data were acquired using Pulse software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Initial pipette resistances were 0.4–1.5 megaohms. Intracellular and extracellular solutions contained 130 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 3 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). Intracellular solutions were changed using an RSC-160 rapid solution changer (Molecular Kinetics, Pullman, WA). Currents in the absence of cyclic nucleotide were subtracted. Macroscopic patch current density was calculated after estimating the area of each patch, A (in μm2), from the initial pipette resistance, R, using the equation A = 12.6 × (1/R + 0.018) (19Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-channel Recording. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 643-649Google Scholar). Steady-state rectification (I +80mV/I –80mV) was determined as the ratio of the current at the end of 60-ms voltage steps to +80 mV and –80 mV. For channel activation by cGMP or cAMP, dose-response data were fitted to the Hill equation, I/I max = ([cNMP] h /(K½h + [cNMP] h)), where I is the current amplitude, I max is the maximum current, [cNMP] is the ligand concentration, K 1/2 is the apparent affinity for ligand, and h is the Hill slope. For ion substitution experiments, the extracellular solution contained 130 mm NaOH, and the intracellular solution contained either 130 mm NaOH, KOH, RbOH, LiOH, or CsOH both with and without cGMP (100 μm or 1 mm). In addition, anhydrous EDTA was substituted for Na2EDTA. Reversal potentials were measured by 200 ms voltage ramps from –100 to +100 mV. The permeability ratio of intracellular ion X+ relative to extracellular Na+, P +X /P Na+, was determined using the bi-ionic form of the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (20Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2001: 1-22Google Scholar), Px-PNa-=[Na+]o[X+]m-e-zFΔVrevRT(Eq. 1) where ΔV rev is the change in reversal potential, [X+]in and [Na+] o are ion activities (21Robinson R. Stokes R. Electrolyte Solutions. 2nd ed. Butterworth and Co., London1959Google Scholar), and the remaining terms have their usual meanings. Conductances were determined at +80 mV. Single channel recordings were made at a 50 kHz sampling rate and filtered at 5 kHz. For single channel analysis, amplitude histograms were constructed from 1–5 s of recorded data at +80 mV. The histograms were fit with two or three gaussian functions, with one gaussian representing the closed state and the other(s) representing the open state(s) for one or two channels, respectively. For current block by l-cis-diltiazem, data were fit to the Hill equation in the form I diltiazem/I = (K ½h /(K ½h + [diltiazem]h)). Data were analyzed using Igor (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), SigmaPlot, and SigmaStat (SPSS Inc.). All values are reported as the mean ± S.E. of n experiments unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significance was determined using a Student's t test or Mann-Whitney rank sum test, and a p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal images were obtained using a 10× objective on a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 inverted microscope equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal laser-scanning system and a kryptonargon laser. Oocytes expressing GFP-tagged CNG channel subunits 64–72 h after injection of mRNA were placed in borosilicate coverglass chambers such that the equator was approximately perpendicular to the plane of imaging. GFP fluorescence was measured using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and a 522 DF 32 emission filter. Laser intensity, pinhole aperture, and photo-multiplier gain were kept constant for all experiments. Oocytes injected with mRNA for non-tagged subunits were included as controls for auto-fluorescence. Images were analyzed using NIH ImageJ software. Surface fluorescence was determined for a defined area positioned at the animal hemisphere of each oocyte and expressed as intensity of signal per unit area; surface fluorescence was then normalized to the mean surface fluorescence of GFP-hCNGA3-expressing oocytes within the same experiment. Biochemistry—To assess the overall abundance of cone CNG channel subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we used Western blot analysis of proteins from oocytes expressing GFP-tagged hCNGA3 or hCNGB3. Oocyte proteins were prepared using a protocol adapted from Rosenbaum and Gordon (22Rosenbaum T. Gordon S.E. Neuron. 2002; 33: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and others (23Rho S. Lee H.M. Lee K. Park C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were placed in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 (Surfact-Amps X-100; Pierce) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Oocytes were subjected to trituration followed by cup sonication using a Branson Sonifier Cell Disruptor 350 (Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT) repeated a total of three times. The soluble cell lysate was then separated from yolk and other insoluble material by centrifugation at 20,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min and repeated three times. Material representing approximately two oocytes was loaded per lane and separated by SDS-PAGE using NuPage 3–8% Tris acetate gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose using the NuPage transfer buffer system (Invitrogen). Immunoblots were probed with anti-GFP Aequorea victoria peptide polyclonal antibody (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) at a concentration of 1:250 in Tris-buffered saline with 1% nonfat dry milk. GFP-tagged channel subunits were visualized using SuperSignal West Dura substrate (Pierce) and autoradiography film (Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1, Eastman Kodak Co.). The approximate molecular weights of the GFP-tagged subunits were calculated by interpolation using the linear relationship between the log of molecular weight for protein standards (Invitrogen), as reported by the manufacturer for these buffer conditions, and the migration distance of the proteins. Functional Expression of Mutant Human CNGB3 Subunits—To investigate the functional consequences of two achromatopsia-associated mutations in the human cone photoreceptor CNG channel β subunit gene (CNGB3) (8Sundin O.H.

A. 1994; 91: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), human CNGB3 failed to generate functional cyclic nucleotide-activated channels when expressed alone in oocytes (data not shown). As previously demonstrated (7Peng C. Rich E.D. Thor C.A. Varnum M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24617-24623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), co-expression of wild type human CNGB3 subunits with human CNGA3 subunits generates heteromeric channels with properties that differ from channels formed by hCNGA3 subunits alone. The altered functional properties include an increase in the relative agonist efficacy for cAMP (Fig. 1B), a small but significant decrease in the apparent affinity for cGMP and increase in apparent affinity for cAMP (Fig. 1, C and D), and sensitivity to regulation by calcium-calmodulin (7Peng C. Rich E.D. Thor C.A. Varnum M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24617-24623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, wild type heteromeric channels exhibited significantly altered steady-state outward rectification for currents elicited by saturating concentrations of cGMP and cAMP (Fig. 1B). I +80mV/I –80mV in 1 mm cGMP was 1.30 ± 0.02 (n = 53) for heteromeric channels and 1.50 ± 0.03 (n = 12) for homomeric CNGA3 channels (p < 0.05); in 10 mm cAMP, I +80mV/I –80mV was 2.81 ± 0.11 (n = 42) for heteromeric channels and 2.00 ± 0.05 (n = 12) for homomeric CNGA3 channels (p < 0.05). Thus, the presence of the human CNGB3 subunit tunes the activation properties of recombinant heteromeric cone CNG channels. Co-expression of CNGB3 subunits containing the achromatopsia-associated S435F mutation with CNGA3 subunits generated channels exhibiting robust cyclic nucleotide-activated currents (Fig. 1B) but with properties differing from both wild type heteromeric channels and homomeric CNGA3 channels. The level of functional expression for mutant heteromeric channels was somewhat reduced compared with channels including wild type CNGB3 subunits; the mean patch current density was 580 ± 82 pA/μm2 (n = 42) for wild type heteromeric channels and 390 ± 106 pA/μm2 (n = 10) for S435F-containing channels (p < 0.05) when co-injected with hCNGA3 under identical conditions. For S435F-containing channels, the relative agonist efficacy for channel activation by a saturating concentration of cAMP compared with maximal activation by cGMP (I maxcAMP/I maxcGMP = 0.33 ± 0.03; n = 23) resembled wild type heteromeric channels (0.36 ± 0.01; n = 37) but not homomeric hCNGA3 channels (0.12 ± 0.01; n = 48) (Fig. 1B), confirming that these mutant CNGB3 subunits combined with CNGA3 subunits to form functional heteromeric channels. The macroscopic current records do not reveal if the mutation altered the absolute efficacy of cAMP or cGMP. Steady-state rectification in the presence of a saturating concentration of cAMP (1.34 ± 0.04; n = 17) was significantly reduced (p < 0.001) compared with both homomeric CNGA3 channels and wild type heteromeric channels. Steady-state rectification in saturating cGMP (1.42 ± 0.02; n = 36) was intermediate between that of homomeric hCNGA3 channels and wild type heteromeric channels (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, fits with the Hill equation of the dose-response relationships for activation of S435F-containing heteromeric channels (Fig. 1, C and D) demonstrated an increase in the apparent affinity for both cAMP (K 1/2 = 184 ± 12 μm; n = 14) and cGMP (K 1/2 = 9.2 ± 0.4 μm; n = 25) compared with activation of wild type heteromeric channels (for cAMP, K 1/2 = 846 ± 33 μm, n = 54; for cGMP, K 1/2 = 15.8 ± 0.3 μm, n = 61). In addition to the change in apparent affinity for cAMP and cGMP, the S435F mutation reduced the Hill slope from 1.5 ± 0.3 (n = 54) and 2.0 ± 0.2 (n = 61), respectively, for wild type heteromeric channels, to 1.1 ± 0.2 (n = 14) and 1.4 ± 0.3 (n = 25), respectively, for mutant heteromeric channels. The apparent affinities also differed significantly from those of homomeric CNGA3 channels for both cAMP (K 1/2 = 1212 ± 37 μm; n = 53) and cGMP (K 1/2 = 12.9 ± 0.5 μm; n = 62) (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1, C and D). These results indicate that the activation properties of heteromeric cone CNG channels are modified by the S435F mutation in the CNGB3 subunit. In contrast, co-expression of hCNGA3 subunits with hCNGB3 subunits containing a different achromatopsia mutation, T383f.s.ΔC, generated CNG channels with properties indistinguishable from homomeric CNGA3 channels. First, the steady-state rectification properties of the expressed channels were similar to those of homomeric CNGA3 channels; I +80mV/I –80mV in 1 mm cGMP was 1.46 ± 0.04 (n = 8) and 2.26 ± 0.06 (n = 8) in 10 mm cAMP (Fig. 1B). Second, the relative efficacy of cAMP (0.13 ± 0.01; n = 8) and the apparent affinities for cAMP (K 1/2 = 12.3 ± 0.2 μm; n = 8) and cGMP (K 1/2 = 1230 ± 77 μm; n = 8) were not significantly changed by the truncated hCNGB3 subunit (Fig. 1, B–D). Third, functional expression level for the hCNGA3-like channels was qualitatively unaffected by the presence of hCNGB3-T383f.s.ΔC subunits; under the same experimental conditions, patch current density was 591 ± 137 pA/μm2 (n = 9) for hCNGA3 plus hCNGB3 T383f.s.ΔC and 589 ± 156 pA/μm2 (n = 18) for hCNGA3 alone. Thus, not only did the basic properties of CNG channels generated by co-injection of mRNA encoding hCNGA3 and hCNGB3-T383f.s.ΔC subunits resemble homomeric hCNGA3 channels, but also no apparent dominant-negative effect of the truncated hCNGB3 subunit was evident. These results are consistent with the idea that complete functional absence of the modulatory CNGB3 subunit can be critical for the development of achromatopsia and that homomeric hCNGA3 channels are not sufficient for normal cone photoreceptor function. Plasma Membrane Targeting of Recombinant Cone CNG Channel Subunits—The pathological basis of many diseaseassociated mutations in the genes that encode ion channels has been attributed to impaired folding, assembly, and/or plasma membrane targeting of channel subunits or complexes. In addition, photoreceptor dysfunction and degeneration have been associated with mutations that disrupt the processing and trafficking of proteins normally targeted to the photoreceptor outer segment (for review, see Ref. 27Rattner A. Sun H. Nathans J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 89-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a mutation in CNGA1 linked to retinitis pigmentosa has been shown to dramatically alter the plasma membrane targeting of recombinant rod CNG channel subunits (28Dryja T.P. Finn J.T.

Thus, we were interested in determining whether achromatopsia-associated mutations in hCNGB3 impaired the assembly and cell-surface localization of recombinant cone CNG channels. To address this question we engineered gene fusions of GFP with the amino-terminal regions of the respective human cone CNG channel subunits, generating GFP-hCNGA3 and GFP-hCNGB3. GFP-tagged subunits provide a convenient means to assess cell-surface localization of CNG channel subunits in oocytes using confocal microscopy. The functional properties of GFP-tagged subunits in the context of both homomeric (for hCNGA3) and heteromeric channels were indistinguishable from those of non-tagged subunits (data not shown). We first investigated the effect of co-expression of wild type or mutant hCNGB3 subunits on the surface expression of GFP-tagged hCNGA3 subunits (Fig. 2, A and B). GFP-hCNGA3 mRNA was injected into oocytes either alone or in combination with mRNAs encoding non-tagged hCNGB3 subunits. For these experiments, the amount of GFP-hCNGA3 mRNA injected was held constant, and the ratio of GFP-hCNGA3 to non-tagged hCNGB3 or control mRNA was fixed at 3:1, a ratio fully effective for the formation of heteromeric channels (data not shown). Compared with the expression of hCNGA3 subunits alone, co-expression of wild-type hCNGB3 subunits attenuated plasma membrane localization of the GFP-tagged hCNGA3 subunits (Fig. 2, A"
https://openalex.org/W2029416847,"We investigated the membrane topology of Bves/Pop1A as a foundation to dissect the molecular basis and function of Bves/Pop1A trafficking during development. Bves contains two asparagine-linked glycosylation sites within the amino terminus and three putative membrane domains. Therefore, glycosylation assays were performed to determine if the amino terminus of Bves is delivered into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and glycosylated. We establish that Bves from chick heart and transfected cells is glycosylated, implying that the amino terminus of cell surface molecules is extracellular. Three biochemically distinct approaches were utilized to determine the orientation of the carboxyl terminus of Bves. First, glycosylation of Bves at exogenous sites within the carboxyl terminus was only observed in a construct that lacked the third membrane domain, which presumably reversed the orientation of the carboxyl terminus. Second, co-expression of full-length Bves with soluble, carboxyl-terminal Bves constructs that reside in different subcellular compartments revealed that Bves-Bves interactions occur in the cytoplasm. Third, the immunoreactivity of endogenous Bves at the cell surface of epicardial cells was dramatically enhanced with detergent. These results suggest that the membrane topology of cell surface Bves/Pop1A is composed of an extracellular amino terminus, three transmembrane domains, and a cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus. We therefore hypothesize that the carboxyl terminus regulates the cellular distribution of Bves/Pop1A during coronary vessel development.

We therefore hypothesize that the carboxyl terminus regulates the cellular distribution of Bves/Pop1A during coronary vessel development. Bves (blood vessel epicardial substance) was identified from a subtractive cDNA screen to identify clones enriched in heart tissue (1Reese D.E. Zavaljevski M. Streiff N.L. Bader D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Chick Bves is a 357-amino acid protein that contains two consensus asparagine-linked glycosylation sites in the amino terminus, three hydrophobic regions that are potential membrane domains, and a large 247-residue carboxyl terminus. Antibodies against chick Bves have labeled the primordial origin of coronary vessels, the proepicardial organ, the epicardium that surrounds the heart, migrating mesenchymal cells derived from the epicardium, and smooth muscle (1Reese D.E. Zavaljevski M. Streiff N.L. Bader D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cellular distribution of Bves changes dynamically from the cell surface in epicardium to a more intracellular location in migrating mesenchyme and later reappears at the cell surface in vascular smooth muscle (2Wada A.M. Reese D.E. Bader D.M. Development. 2001; 128: 2085-2093PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that Bves functions as a cell adhesion molecule based on the results of transfected l-cells (2Wada A.M. Reese D.E. Bader D.M. Development. 2001; 128: 2085-2093PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to elucidate the membrane topology of Bves to distinguish intracellular regions that may be involved in this dynamic, intracellular trafficking from extracellular regions that may directly participate in cell-cell interactions. The Popeye family of transcripts was independently identified and found to be highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle (3Andrée B. Hillemann T. Kessler-Icekson G. Schmitt-John T. Jockusch H. Arnold H.H. Brand T. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Two Popeye genes were identified in chick (POP1 and POP3). In addition, four alternatively spliced chick POP1 transcripts were isolated (POP1A through -1D), and POP1A was found to be identical to Bves (3Andrée B. Hillemann T. Kessler-Icekson G. Schmitt-John T. Jockusch H. Arnold H.H. Brand T. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although POP1 knockout mice did not exhibit an overt phenotype, treatment of mice that lack POP1 with cardiotoxin displayed delayed skeletal muscle regeneration relative to wild-type mice (4Andrée B. Fleige A. Arnold H.H. Brand T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Establishing the membrane topology of Bves/Pop1A would provide a foundation for identifying and characterizing functional domains at the cellular level. The membrane topology of Bves/Pop1A is unknown, but two distinct models have been proposed (2Wada A.M. Reese D.E. Bader D.M. Development. 2001; 128: 2085-2093PubMed Google Scholar, 4Andrée B. Fleige A. Arnold H.H. Brand T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although both groups assumed that all three hydrophobic domains span the membrane, their models present different locations of the termini. Wada et al. (2Wada A.M. Reese D.E. Bader D.M. Development. 2001; 128: 2085-2093PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the amino terminus is cytoplasmic and the carboxyl terminus is extracellular. In contrast, Andrée et al. (4Andrée B. Fleige A. Arnold H.H. Brand T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) proposed that the amino terminus is extracellular and the carboxyl terminus is intracellular. Here, we document that the amino terminus of Bves/Pop1A from chick heart and transfected cells is glycosylated at asparagine-linked sites. Furthermore, the orientation of the carboxyl terminus was examined using exogenous glycosylation sites, Bves-Bves interactions, and immunocytochemistry. Our results support a three transmembrane model of Bves/Pop1A in which the amino terminus of cell surface molecules is exposed to the extracellular environment, whereas the carboxyl terminus is exposed to the cytoplasm. Chick Bves cDNA and Mutants—Bves/POP1A was subcloned into the XhoI-SalI sites of pCI-neo (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR was used to add epitope tags and generate mutants. The reagents consisted of the plasmid containing chick Bves/POP1A, recombinant Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the appropriate primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The primers used to generate all Bves constructs described in this study are listed in Table I, and a schematic of representative constructs is illustrated in Fig. 1. The FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was added to the extreme carboxyl terminus, yielding Bves-FLAG. The HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; WT, wild-type.-epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) was incorporated into the amino terminus between Leu27 and Lys28 of Bves/Pop1A, yielding HA-Bves. HA-Bves-FLAG was used to compare the immunoreactivity of anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. An insert (GVEVEAVSLLNQTV), based on a glycosylated region of the rat concentrative Na+-nucleoside cotransporter (5Hamilton S.R. Yao S.Y. Ingram J.C. Hadden D.A. Ritzel M.W. Gallagher M.P.

Mutation of the Asn residue within the rCNT1 insert to Ala yielded rCNT1-N/A. The carboxyl-terminal Bves construct Met128-FLAG was generated with primers Xho-Met128 sense, containing a portion of the coding region that starts at Met128, and BstEII antisense. The carboxyl-terminal Bves construct 2C/Met128-FLAG was made with primers that correspond to the end of the amino terminus of the rat serotonin 5-HT2C receptor (2C) and the beginning of Met128-FLAG. The 51-amino acid 2C region encodes a cleavable signal sequence and an endogenous Asn-linked glycosylation site at Asn39. 2J. R. Backstrom, unpublished data. PCR fragments were digested and ligated into Bves plasmid backbones. The sequences of all amplified fragments were determined at the DNA Core in the Stahlman Cardiovascular Research Laboratories.Table ISequences of primers used to generate Bves constructsPrimerDirectionSequence (5′ → 3′)pClneo (1009)SenseCTTTCTCTCC ACAGGTGTCC ACTCCCAGTT CAXho-5′ cBvesSenseAGCCTCGAGA CACGGGGACA GGATTCTTCA AGATGBstEII (640)AntisenseATCATCTGCG ATAATGGTGA CCTGGAA560SenseAATGAAGGTT TCTTATCGAG GGCATEcoR1 (280)SenseCTTGGACATA ATGATCTGGA ATTCTGTGTTcBves-FLAG-Sal-3′AntisenseGGTCGACTCT ATTACTTGTC ATCGTCGTCC TTGTAGTCcBves-Sal-3′AntisenseCTTGTCATCG TCGTCGACGT ATTAAGGCAG CCGCTGCAGC TCAAGN20ASenseGTTATTCCAG ACTTAAAAGC TGCCACCTCT GTGCCTTTCN20AAntisenseGAAAGGCACA GAGGTGGCAG CTTTTAAGTC TGGAATAACN27ASenseGCCACCTCTG TGCCTTTCGC CGAGACTGCA TGTGAAAACN27AAntisenseGTTTTCACAT GCAGTCTCGG CGAAAGGCAC AGAGGTGGCHA-5′f shortAntisenseAGGATATAAG TCAGGAATAA CGCCCAGAGG AGTGAGHA-5′f longAntisenseCGCATAGTCA GGAACGTCGT AAGGATATAA GTCAGGAATA ACGCCHA-3′f shortSenseTATGCGAAAA ATGCCACCTC TGTGCCTTTC AACHA-3′f longSenseTATCCTTACG ACGTTCCTGA CTATGCGAAA AATGCCACCT CTGTGKELS/NETS (119)AntisenseTCTCTTGTAC AGGCTGCTGG TCTCATTCTC TATCTTGATC GGTCTKELS/NETS (119)SenseAGACCGATCA AGATAGAGAA TGAGACCAGC AGCCTGTACA AGAGAMFEP/MNLT (129)AntisenseTGGAGGCACA TGGAGTGTTT CATTCATTCT CTTGTACAGG CTMFEP/MNLT (129)SenseAGCCTGTACA AGAGAATGAA TGAAACACTC CATGTGCCTC CAQRLT/QNLT (141)AntisenseGCAGAATTGC CCAGTTAAGT TTTGAAATAG CTCTGGAGGC ACQRLT/QNLT (141)SenseGTGCCTCCAG AGCTATTTCA AAACTTAACT GGGCAATTCT GCEDKT/KNET (162)AntisenseCCTGTCATCA ACTGATGTTT CATTCTTTGC AGCATAAGCT TGACCEDKT/KNET (162)SenseGGTCAAGCTT ATGCTGCAAA GAATGAAACA TCAGTTGATG ACAGGGEK/NET (209)AntisenseAATGGTGACC TGGAATGTTT CATTACGGTT CATCTGAGTT GATCGrCNT1 5′f shortAntisenseTACTTCCACG CCTTTGATCG GTCTTCTTTT ATACACCAAG TArCNT1 5′f longAntisenseGTTAAGGAGG GACACGGCTT CTACTTCCAC GCCTTTGATC GGTCTTCTrCNT1 3′f shortSenseAACCAAACTG TCCTATTTCA GAGATTAACT GGGCAATTCT GCAACrCNT1 3′f longSenseGTAGAAGCCG TGTCCCTCCT TAACCAAACT GTCCTATTTC AGAGATTAACTD3T 5′fAntisenseGAT CGGTCTT CTGAGTGTAG CCCAAATGAT GAACAATGCD3T/rCNT1 3′fSenseTGGGCTACAC TCAGAAGACC GATCAAAGGC GTGGAAGTArCNT1-N/ASenseGTGGAAGTAG AAGCCGTGTC CCTCCTTGCC CAAACTGTCC TArCNT1-N/AAntisenseTAGGACAGTT TGGGCAAGGA GGGACACGGC TTCTACTTCC ACXho-Met128SenseCCTCGAGAAT GTTTGAACCA CTCCATGTGC2C-Xho 5′fSenseCCTCGAGCAA TCATGGTGAA CCTTGGCAAC GCG2C/Met128-5′fAntisenseTGGCTCAAAC ATATCCGGGA ACTGAAACAA GCGTCCACCA TC2C/Met128-3′fSenseCAGTTCCCGG ATATGTTTGA GCCACTCCAT GTGCCTCCAG AG Open table in a new tab Cells—Monkey kidney COS epithelial cells, mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, and mouse skeletal muscle precursor C2C12 cells were obtained from the ATCC.

Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the carboxyl terminus of Bves (B846) have been previously described (2Wada A.M. Reese D.E. Bader D.M. Development. 2001; 128: 2085-2093PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2; 1:1000), polyclonal anti-HA (1:250), and monoclonal anti-β-catenin (1:200) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Rabbit anti-calnexin (SPA-860; 1:200) was purchased from StressGen (San Diego, CA). Goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit conjugated to alkaline phosphatase were from Dako Corp. (Carpenteria, CA). Goat anti-mouse conjugated to Alexa488 was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The remaining antibodies used in this study were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Analysis of Bves from Chick Heart—Chick hearts from day 6 embryos were used to examine glycosylation of Bves. Cell extracts prepared essentially as described (6Backstrom J.R. Price R.D. Reasoner D.T. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23620-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were treated with buffer or recombinant N-glycosidase F (Glyko, Novato, CA) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. A 4× solution of SDS-sample buffer (250 mm Tris, pH 6.8, containing 8% SDS, 40% glycerol) was added to each tube, and protein concentrations were estimated with the BCA assay (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) using bovine serum albumin as the protein standard. Blots of 30 μg of samples (containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) were probed with anti-Bves (B846) and immunoreactive bands detected with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (Pierce). Transfection of Cells—COS and C2C12 cells were transfected with cDNA prepared in LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). The DNA solution was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO2. NIH/3T3 cells were electroporated with 25 μg of DNA (6Backstrom J.R. Price R.D. Reasoner D.T. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23620-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and grown as per the COS and C2C12 cells. For the experiments that involved preventing Asn-linked glycosylation in COS cells, the DNA solution was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.2 μg/ml tunicamycin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Cells were washed once with Hanks' buffered saline solution containing CaCl2 and MgCl2 (Invitrogen) before extracting protein. Extraction of Protein from Cells—Detergent-soluble protein was extracted from cells as described previously (6Backstrom J.R. Price R.D. Reasoner D.T. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23620-23626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated with the BCA assay (Pierce). Biotinylation of Cell Surface Protein—COS cells transfected with either Bves-FLAG or rat 5-HT2C receptor cDNA (negative control) were incubated with 0.5 mm NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in Hanks' buffered saline solution as per the manufacturer's protocol. Protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG and subjected to electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Separate lanes were probed with either anti-FLAG to detect total cellular protein or with 0.5 μg/ml streptavidin-phosphatase (Pierce) to detect cell surface protein. Co-immunoprecipitation—COS cells were co-transfected with 4 μg of HA-Bves and 4 μg of either Met128-FLAG or 2C/Met128-FLAG. Anti-FLAG (2 μg) was added to tubes containing 1% Triton-soluble protein and incubated with rocking at 4 °C. After 4 h, 20 μl of anti-mouse Protein G beads (1:2 slurry) was added. The beads were prepared from cross-linking goat anti-mouse IgG to Protein G at a final concentration of 3.2 mg of antibody/ml of beads using Seize-X (Pierce). After an overnight incubation with rocking at 4 °C, supernatants were discarded, and the beads were washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Protein was eluted from the beads with 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to incubation in a 95 °C water bath for 1 min. Two blots were used to analyze 20-μl aliquots of each sample elution (40% of total) and a sample of starting extract (4% of input). Immunocytochemistry—Cells grown in 8-well chamber slides were either fixed and permeabilized with HistoChoice MB (Amresco, Solon, OH) or fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS. The wells were washed once with 2% bovine serum albumin in TBS and blocked with the same solution overnight at 4 °C. Cells were treated with primary antibodies followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies, each for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBS and two washes with water, slides were dried and coverslipped with Aqua Poly-Mount (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). Fluorescent images were captured using an Olympus BX60 microscope in the Stahlman Cardiovascular Research Laboratories. Glycosylation of Bves from Chick Heart—Chick Bves/Pop1A contains two consensus Asn-linked glycosylation sites within the amino terminus (Asn20 and Asn27; Fig. 1). Because these are the only Asn-linked sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr), evidence of glycosylation would establish that the amino terminus of Bves reached the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, which corresponds to the extracellular environment of cell surface molecules. Thus, extracts prepared from chick heart were incubated in the absence or presence of N-glycosidase F. Protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blots were probed with anti-Bves antibodies (B846). In the absence of N-glycosidase, a diffuse pattern of bands were detected with masses of 56–58 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 1). In contrast, N-glycosidase decreased the size of immunoreactive bands to 43 kDa (lane 2), which is similar to the predicted mass of 41 kDa. An additional minor band was also observed at 50 kDa, which may represent a partially deglycosylated form of Bves. Glycosylation of the Amino Terminus of Bves from Transfected Cells—Glycosylation of Bves was next examined from transfected COS kidney epithelial cells (Fig. 3, top panel), NIH/3T3 fibroblasts (middle panel), and skeletal muscle precursor cells (bottom panel). Wild-type (WT) Bves displayed a predominant immunoreactive band with a mass of 47 kDa (lane 1). Point mutations were made at either one or both consensus Asn-linked sites. Whereas the N20A (lane 2) and N27A (lane 3) mutations produced major bands with masses of 45 kDa, mutation of both sites (N20A/N27A, lane 4) yielded a major band at 43 kDa. These results from transfected cells and chick heart establish that the amino terminus of Bves is glycosylated. Glycosylation at Exogenous Sites within the Carboxyl Terminus of Bves—The glycosylation studies were extended to examine the possibility that the carboxyl terminus of Bves also reaches the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. To ensure that this assay would indicate glycosylation at an exogenous site, the endogenous sites within the amino terminus were mutated to alanine (N20A/N27A; Fig. 1). Exogenous glycosylation sites (Asn-Glu-Thr) or (Asn-Ala-Thr) were introduced at five different positions within the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 4A). An additional construct (N20A/N27A/rCNT1) was created that contains a 14-amino acid insert based on a region of the carboxyl terminus of rCNT1 that contains a functional Asn-linked glycosylation site (5Hamilton S.R. Yao S.Y. Ingram J.C. Hadden D.A. Ritzel M.W. Gallagher M.P. Henderson P.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27981-27988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). An increase in size was not observed with any of the constructs containing an exogenous site (Fig. 4B). Thus, either the structure of Bves prevented glycosylation or the carboxyl terminus is exposed to the cytoplasm. We explored the possibility that removing the third membrane domain of Bves would reverse the orientation of the carboxyl terminus and direct it into the endoplasmic reticulum. Our efforts focused on constructs that contain the rCNT1 insert for these sets of experiments. A D3T/rCNT1 construct was created that lacks the predicted third membrane domain (Figs. 1 and 5A) and transfected into COS cells. Deletion of the third transmembrane domain yielded bands on immunoblots with masses of 41 and 43 kDa (Fig. 5B , lane 3). The 2-kDa difference in mass was consistent with the results obtained for each site in the amino terminus of wild-type Bves (lane 1). Although the D3T/rCNT1 construct lacks endogenous glycosylation sites within the amino terminus, two strategies were employed to confirm that formation of the minor, 43-kDa band of D3T/rCNT1 was due to glycosylation of the 41-kDa protein. First, cells were grown in the presence of the Asn-linked glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin to prevent glycosylation. Tunicamycin prevented the appearance of the larger immunoreactive bands in D3T/rCNT1 (lane 4) as well as in wild-type Bves (lane 2). Second, the Asn residue within the rCNT1 insert was mutated to Ala (D3T/rCNT1-N/A). Whereas two bands were detected from D3T/rCNT1 (Fig. 5C , lane 2), only a single immunoreactive band was observed from D3T/rCNT1-N/A (lane 3), confirming that the Asn residue within the rCNT1 insert provided a functional glycosylation site. These results provide evidence that the carboxyl terminus of wild-type Bves is located in the cytoplasm, and removal of the third membrane domain reverses its orientation into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Surface Biotinylation of Bves—Biotinylation experiments were performed to determine whether Bves reaches the cell surface of COS cells. Cells expressing either Bves-FLAG or a negative control construct were incubated with NHS-LC-biotin to label cell surface protein. Cell extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG antibodies and anti-mouse beads. Precipitated proteins were electrophoresed, and the resulting blots were probed with either anti-FLAG to detect total cellular Bves (Fig. 6, lane 1) or streptavidin-phosphatase to detect cell surface Bves (lane 2). These results document that Bves is localized primarily within intracellular compartments of COS cells, whereas only low levels are present at the cell surface. Therefore, approaches to determine the membrane topology of Bves in COS cells examine properties of Bves within intracellular compartments. Oligomerization of Bves—During the course of characterizing immunoreactive Bves on immunoblots, we found that the banding pattern of Bves derived from cell extracts electrophoresed under reducing versus non-reducing conditions was different. Under reducing conditions (1% 2-mercaptoethanol), a predominant, monomeric form of Bves-FLAG was observed (Fig. 7, lane 4). Under non-reducing conditions, several higher molecular mass forms of Bves-FLAG were observed in addition to the monomeric form (lane 1). The amount of monomer from both electrophoretic conditions was compared with indirectly estimate the relative level of oligomers. The monomer from 4 μg of protein run under non-reducing conditions displayed equivalent immunoreactivity to that from 1 μg of protein run under reducing conditions (data not illustrated). These results imply that ∼80% of the Bves protein from COS cells exists in an oligomeric form. Similar results were obtained from C2C12 skeletal muscle precursor cells transfected with Bves-FLAG (data not illustrated). Characterization of Bves Carboxyl-terminal Constructs— Next, we examined whether oligomerization of Bves occurs within the carboxyl terminus. If so, we could exploit this interaction to determine the orientation of Bves. Similar to the results with full-length Bves-FLAG (Fig. 7, lane 1), a carboxyl-terminal Bves construct that lacks the membrane domains and starts at Met128 (Met128-FLAG; Fig. 1) also formed oligomers under non-reducing conditions (lane 2) and monomers under reducing conditions (lane 5). We postulated that wild-type Bves would interact with a carboxyl-terminal Bves construct if the construct was delivered to the subcellular compartment where the carboxyl-terminal tail of wild-type Bves resides. For example, if the carboxyl terminus of Bves is located in the cytoplasm, it could potentially interact with Met128-FLAG, but not if Met128-FLAG was delivered to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, a chimeric protein was created that contains the amino terminus of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor fused to Met128-FLAG (2C/Met128-FLAG; Fig. 1). The 2C region contains an endogenous Asn-linked glycosylation site; therefore, glycosylation of 2C/Met128-FLAG would confirm delivery into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Importantly, 2C/Met128-FLAG formed oligomers under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 7, lane 3) and monomers under reducing conditions (lane 6). Immunocytochemistry was utilized to determine whether the gross cellular distribution of the carboxyl-terminal constructs Met128-FLAG and 2C/Met128-FLAG are clearly different. COS cells were transiently transfected with the Bves constructs and labeled with mouse anti-FLAG followed by Cy3-labeled anti-mouse (Fig. 8). Full-length Bves-FLAG (A) displayed a similar fibrous labeling pattern as the chimeric carboxyl-terminal construct 2C/Met128-FLAG (B). Furthermore, the results from double-labeling experiments revealed that the distribution of Bves-FLAG and 2C/Met128-FLAG were strikingly similar to the endoplasmic reticulum protein calnexin (data not illustrated). In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal construct Met128-FLAG (C) displayed a diffuse labeling pattern consistent with a cytoplasmic location. A glycosylation assay was used to confirm that 2C/Met128-FLAG reaches the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. COS cells transfected with either Bves-FLAG or 2C/Met128-FLAG were incubated in the absence or presence of tunicamycin. In the absence of tunicamycin, the fully glycosylated form of Bves-FLAG had the expected mass of 47 kDa (Fig. 9, lane 2), whereas that of 2C/Met128-FLAG was 41 kDa (lane 4). In the presence of tunicamycin, Bves-FLAG and 2C/Met128-FLAG had smaller masses of 43 kDa (lane 1) and 39 kDa (lane 3), respectively. In summary, these results in COS cells establish that Met128-FLAG localizes to the cytoplasm, whereas 2C/Met128-FLAG reaches the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and both carboxyl-terminal constructs form oligomers. Co-immunoprecipitation of Bves—Because Met128-FLAG is localized in the cytoplasm, whereas 2C/Met128-FLAG reaches the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (illustrated in Fig. 10A), selective co-immunoprecipitation of HA-Bves would delineate the cellular location of its carboxyl terminus. Initial characterization studies of the antibodies directed against the HA and FLAG epitopes were performed to determine which antibody should be used for immunoprecipitation and which antibody should be used for detection on blots. HA-Bves-FLAG, containing both epitope tags (Fig. 1), was expressed in COS cells and the cell extracts used to test the antibodies. The mouse anti-FLAG antibody immunoprecipitated ∼6-fold more immunoreactive HA-Bves-FLAG protein relative to the rabbit anti-HA antibody (data not illustrated). In contrast, the anti-HA antibody was only ∼2-fold less reactive on blots against HA-Bves-FLAG relative to anti-FLAG (data not illustrated). Additionally, anti-HA detected HA-Bves but not Bves-FLAG on blots (data not illustrated). Therefore, anti-FLAG was used to immunoprecipitate the carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged constructs from cell extracts and anti-HA was used to detect potential associated HA-Bves. HA-Bves was co-expressed with either Met128-FLAG or 2C/Met128-FLAG in COS cells. Mouse anti-FLAG was added to each cell extract and immunoprecipitated with goat anti-mouse cross-linked to Protein G beads. After washing the beads, protein was eluted with sample buffer containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Separate blots were probed with anti-FLAG and anti-HA (Fig. 10B). The cell extracts contained considerably less Met128-FLAG relative to 2C/Met128-FLAG (top panel, lanes 1 and 2), whereas HA-Bves was expressed at similar levels from both extracts (bottom panel, lanes 1 and 2). In agreement with their expression levels, the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates yielded lower levels of Met128-FLAG (top panel, lane 3) relative to 2C/Met128-FLAG (lane 4). However, co-immunoprecipitated HA-Bves was detected in association with Met128-FLAG (bottom panel, lane 3) but was not detected in association with 2C/Met128-FLAG (lane 4). Similar results were obtained when anti-HA was used with goat anti-rabbit beads to immunoprecipitate HA-Bves and anti-FLAG detected an association with only Met128-FLAG (data not illustrated). However, the level of co-immunoprecipitated Met128-FLAG was barely detected above background, which was consistent with the initial antibody characterization studies. Immunocytochemistry of Endogenous Bves in Rat Epicardial Cells—The results thus far, based on properties of Bves within intracellular compartments, predict that the carboxyl terminus of cell surface Bves would be exposed to the cytoplasm rather than to the extracellular environment. To directly address this issue, we utilized an epithelial cell line derived from rat heart epicardium (epicardial cells) that expresses endogenous Bves. It was previously demonstrated that confluent cultures of epicardial cells express the majority of Bves immunoreactivity at the cell surface (2Wada A.M. Reese D.E. Bader D.M. Development. 2001; 128: 2085-2093PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we could determine the effect of non-ionic detergent on the availability of a carboxyl-terminal epitope. The optimal concentration of fixative was found to be 1% paraformaldehyde using antibodies against β-catenin as a control to label an intracellular protein localized at the cell surface (data not illustrated). Thus, epicardial cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and then treated in the absence or presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. Bves was labeled with rabbit anti-Bves (B846), directed against amino acids 263–278 of the carboxyl terminus, and mouse anti-β-catenin. Immunoreactive protein was visualized with Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit and Alexa488-labeled anti-mouse antibodies. In the first set of experiments, antibodies were used to label separate wells of epicardial cells (Fig. 11). Faint Bves and β-catenin labeling was detected in untreated cells (panels A and B, respectively), whereas robust labeling of both antibodies was detected in detergent-treated cells (panels C and D, respectively). In the second set of experiments, cells were double-labeled with both antibodies (data not illustrated). Enhanced immunoreactivity of anti-Bves and anti-β-catenin was again observed in detergent-treated cells relative to untreated cells. These results support the prediction that the carboxyl terminus of cell surface Bves is exposed to the cytoplasm. Bves/POP1A is a member of the recently discovered Popeye (POP) family of transcripts that are expressed in several tissue types (1Reese D.E. Zavaljevski M. Streiff N.L. Bader D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 3Andrée B. Hillemann T. Kessler-Icekson G. Schmitt-John T. Jockusch H. Arnold H.H. Brand T. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Whereas POP1, POP2, and POP3 transcripts have been discovered from mouse, only POP1 and POP3 have been isolated thus far from chicken (3Andrée B. Hillemann T. Kessler-Icekson G. Schmitt-John T. Jockusch H. Arnold H.H. Brand T. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, splice variants of chick POP1 have been identified, including POP1A (identical to Bves), 1B, 1C, and 1D (3Andrée B. Hillemann T. Kessler-Icekson G. Schmitt-John T. Jockusch H. Arnold H.H. Brand T. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Interestingly, POP1C is predicted to encode a soluble protein homologous to a region of the carboxyl terminus, whereas the other isoforms contain hydrophobic membrane domains. An overt phenotypic difference was not observed in POP1 knockout mice relative to wild-type littermates, but regeneration of cardiotoxin-treated skeletal muscle was delayed in mice that lack POP1 (4Andrée B. Fleige A. Arnold H.H. Brand T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that other Pop proteins compensate for a loss of Pop1 function in tissues that co-express more than one Pop member. It is important to resolve whether other Pop members compensate for the loss of Pop1 function during development as well as determine how Bves/Pop1A functions at the cellular level. In addition to muscle tissue, Bves/Pop1A is also found in cells that develop coronary vessels. Coronary blood vessels develop from transitory epithelium of the proepicardial organ. This epithelium provides the epicardial covering of the heart and precursors that form various differentiated cell types of coronary vessels. A subpopulation of epicardial cells delaminate from the epithelial cell layer, migrate into the subepicardial connective tissue and myocardium (9Manasek F.J. J. Morphol. 1968; 125: 329-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 10Viragh S. Challice C.E. Anat. Rec. 1981; 201: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 11Hiruma T. Hirakow R. Am. J. Anat. 1989; 184: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 12Manner J. Anat. Embryol. 1993; 187: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and differentiate into vascular endothelium, vascular smooth muscle, or fibroblasts of coronary vessels (13Mikawa T. Gourdie R.G. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 14Dettman R.W. Denetclaw W. Ordahl C.P. Bristow J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 193: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Bves is found in the epicardium, migrating mesenchyme, and vascular smooth muscle (1Reese D.E. Zavaljevski M. Streiff N.L. Bader D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Bves at the cell surface of epicardial cells later accumulates in an intracellular compartment of migrating mesenchymal cells and then reappears at the cell surface of smooth muscle cells (2Wada A.M. Reese D.E. Bader D.M. Development. 2001; 128: 2085-2093PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Bves may be functional at only one cellular location or have a unique function at each location. Interestingly, Bves enhances the adhesive property of non-adherent l-cells, which suggests that Bves has a function at the cell surface (2Wada A.M. Reese D.E. Bader D.M. Development. 2001; 128: 2085-2093PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, it is critical to elucidate the membrane topology of Bves to identify regions that likely contain functional domains. The findings that Bves promotes cell adhesion and its distribution is dynamically regulated during development suggest that several functional domains are involved. Thus, the goal of this study was to elucidate the membrane topology of Bves to discriminate extracellular regions that may directly participate in cell-cell interactions from intracellular regions that may be involved in trafficking. This functional distinction does not exclude the possibility that intracellular domains participate in regulating adhesive properties, which has been documented for the prototypic cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin (reviewed in Ref. 15Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, defining the membrane topology of Bves/Pop1A would provide a basis for subsequent functional studies. Two different models have been proposed for the membrane topology of Bves/Pop1A. Andrée et al. (4Andrée B. Fleige A. Arnold H.H. Brand T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) proposed that the amino terminus is extracellular. The data from in vitro translation of Bves/Pop1A in the presence of microsomes (2Wada A.M. Reese D.E. Bader D.M. Development. 2001; 128: 2085-2093PubMed Google Scholar, 3Andrée B. Hillemann T. Kessler-Icekson G. Schmitt-John T. Jockusch H. Arnold H.H. Brand T. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) clearly demonstrated an increase in mass that could be due to Asn-linked glycosylation. Because the amino terminus of Bves is the only region that contains consensus Asn-linked sites, glycosylation would establish that the amino terminus of cell surface Bves is exposed to the extracellular environment. Here, we thoroughly examined glycosylation of Bves from chick heart and transfected cells. Whereas Andrée et al. (4Andrée B. Fleige A. Arnold H.H. Brand T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) proposed that the carboxyl terminus of Bves/Pop1A is intracellular, Wada et al. (2Wada A.M. Reese D.E. Bader D.M. Development. 2001; 128: 2085-2093PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that it is extracellular, based on the results from antibody blocking experiments. Antibodies against the carboxyl terminus of Bves (B846) blocked cell migration in primary cultures of chick proepicardia, whereas antibodies against another carboxyl-terminal epitope (D033) were without effect (2Wada A.M. Reese D.E. Bader D.M. Development. 2001; 128: 2085-2093PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we utilized three different approaches to determine the orientation of the carboxyl terminus of Bves. Glycosylation of Bves was examined to determine whether the amino terminus reaches the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and is glycosylated. Bves from chick heart was glycosylated, and mutating the two Asn-linked glycosylation sites prevented glycosylation of Bves. These results establish that the amino terminus of Bves/Pop1A, the only region that contains Asn-linked sites, reaches the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, implying that the amino terminus of cell surface molecules would be exposed to the extracellular environment. Three biochemically distinct approaches were utilized to determine the orientation of the carboxyl terminus of Bves/Pop1A. The first two approaches examined Bves within intracellular compartments of transfected cells, whereas the third approach examined cell surface Bves in a native cell background. First, glycosylation assays were utilized to examine Asn-linked glycosylation at exogenous sites within the carboxyl terminus of Bves. Second, oligomerization of Bves within the carboxyl terminus was exploited to investigate interactions between wild-type Bves and a soluble, carboxyl-terminal construct that either resides in the cytoplasm or is delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Third, immunocytochemistry was performed with antibodies against the carboxyl terminus of Bves to examine endogenous protein at the cell surface of epicardial cells. Although each approach has inherent caveats, together, the results provide compelling evidence that the carboxyl terminus of Bves is exposed to the cytoplasm. The results from this study support a topological model in which the amino terminus of cell surface Bves/Pop1A is exposed to the extracellular environment, whereas the carboxyl terminus is exposed to the cytoplasm, a membrane topology consistent with three membrane domains. The data presented here agree with the model proposed by Andrée et al. (4Andrée B. Fleige A. Arnold H.H. Brand T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that was based on data that did not establish the orientation of the carboxyl terminus. In contrast, Wada et al. (2Wada A.M. Reese D.E. Bader D.M. Development. 2001; 128: 2085-2093PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the carboxyl terminus of Bves was extracellular based on their results from antibody blocking experiments. The same polyclonal anti-Bves carboxyl-terminal antibodies (B846) that blocked cell migration of chick proepicardial explants (2Wada A.M. Reese D.E. Bader D.M. Development. 2001; 128: 2085-2093PubMed Google Scholar) were utilized here in the immunocytochemistry experiments with rat epicardial cells. A potential explanation for these apparently conflicting results is that the Bves antibodies neutralized a secreted Pop member, possibly Pop1C. We are currently investigating several avenues to reconcile this important issue. Significantly, the current results from three biochemically distinct approaches indicate that the carboxyl terminus of Bves/Pop1A is exposed to the cytoplasm. The membrane topology of Bves/Pop1A provides regional discrimination of functional domains. First, we predict that direct cell-cell interactions occur between the amino termini of opposing Bves molecules. Second, we predict that the dynamic redistribution of Bves during coronary vessel development is regulated within the carboxyl terminus. Our goal is to identify the functional domain(s) within each of these regions. Establishing the membrane topology of Bves/Pop1A has provided a foundation to dissect the cellular functions of Bves/Pop1A.

https://openalex.org/W1969014734,"The human tumor suppressor gene ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) encodes a 3056 amino-acid protein kinase that regulates cell cycle checkpoints. ATM is defective in the neurodegenerative and cancer predisposition syndrome ataxia-telangiectasia. ATM protein kinase is activated by DNA damage and responds by phosphorylating downstream effectors involved in cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, such as p53, MDM2, CHEK2, BRCA1 and H2AX. ATM is probably a component of, or in close proximity to, the double-stranded DNA break-sensing machinery. We have observed purified human ATM protein, ATM–DNA and ATM–DNA–avidin bound complexes by single-particle electron microscopy and obtained three-dimensional reconstructions which show that ATM is composed of two main domains comprising a head and an arm. DNA binding to ATM induces a large conformational movement of the arm-like domain. Taken together, these three structures suggest that ATM is capable of interacting with DNA, using its arm to clamp around the double helix."
https://openalex.org/W2061279823,"We examined the effects of the expansion of glutamine repeats on the early stage of protein fibrillization. Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and electron microscopic studies revealed that the elongation of polyglutamine from 35 to 50 repeats in protein induced a large assembly of the protein upon incubation at 37 °C and that its formation was completed in ∼3 h. A bead modeling procedure based on SAXS spectra indicated that the largely assembled species of the protein, quasi-aggregate, is composed of 80 to ∼90 monomers and a bowl-like structure with long and short axes of 400 and 190 Å, respectively. Contrary to fibril, the quasi-aggregate did not show a peak at S = 0.21 Å–1 corresponding to the 4.8-Å spacing of β-pleated sheets in SAXS spectra, and reacted with a monoclonal antibody specific to expanded polyglutamine. These results imply that β-sheets of expanded polyglutamines in the quasi-aggregate are not orderly aligned and are partially exposed, in contrast to regularly oriented and buried β-pleated sheets in fibril.

Amyloid is a fibrillar deposit observed in various proteins associated with human neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's diseases, Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases, and polyglutamine diseases. Amyloid has a “cross-β structure,” with β-strands perpendicular to, and backbone hydrogen bonds parallel to, the fibril axis (1Sunde M. Blake C. Adv.

Thus, studies on the earliest phase of protein fibrillization, in particular the oligomerization and nucleation processes, are of great importance for identifying therapeutic targets as well as for understanding the molecular mechanism of fibril formation. In addition, structural characterization of such globular precursors of amyloid fibril would be important to reveal origins of the cellular toxicity of the amyloid-forming proteins.Amyloid fibrils are also observed in the aggregates of proteins bearing an expanded polyglutamine (12Scherzinger E.

Although the expansion of glutamine repeat in general renders the protein insoluble in water, we successfully established preparation of the mutant Mbs containing 50 (Mb-Gln50) or 35 (Mb-Gln35) glutamine repeats on a large scale, which is required for their structural analysis. 50 glutamine repeats inserted into protein are pathological, whereas 35 glutamine repeats lie between pathological and non-pathological status in polyglutamine diseases. In our previous study (17Tanaka M. Morishima I. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45470-45475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), Mb-Gln50 and Mb-Gln35, but not a mutant Mb bearing shorter, 12 glutamine repeats (Mb-Gln12), reacted with a monoclonal 1C2 antibody specific for an expanded polyglutamine (18Trottier Y. Lutz Y. Stevanin G. Imbert G. Devys D. Cancel G. Saudou F. Weber C. David G. Tora L. et al.Nature. 1995; 378: 403-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), suggesting that the expanded polyglutamines in Mb-Gln50 and Mb-Gln35 form a characteristic structure similar to that of the native proteins that cause polyglutamine diseases. In addition, the tendency to form amyloid fibrils was highly dependent on the length of glutamine repeats inserted into Mb. Mb-Gln50 and Mb-Gln35 formed amyloid fibrils under physiological conditions rapidly and slowly, respectively, whereas Mb-Gln12 and Mb wild-type (Mb-WT) did not form any amyloid fibrils under the same conditions (17Tanaka M. Morishima I. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45470-45475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We suggest, by these observations, that Mb-Gln50 and Mb-Gln35 would be appropriate to investigate the effects of the expansion of glutamine repeats on the fibrillization process of polyglutamine-bearing proteins. To elucidate the formation mechanism of fibril would be crucial for better comprehension of the molecular basis for polyglutamine diseases.In the present study, we applied small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to examine and compare the early stage of fibril formation of the mutant Mbs, because SAXS is a powerful technique for quantitative detection of smaller particles with accurate time dependence, compared with light scattering. We revealed that the expansion of polyglutamine from 35 to 50 repeats in a mutant Mb induced a large assembly of the protein in the early phase of fibrillization. The formation of a largely assembled species of Mb-Gln50 was confirmed by electron microscopy. We further examined structural properties of β-sheets of expanded polyglutamines in the Mb-Gln50 assembled species and determined its low-resolution structure based on SAXS spectra.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—Recombinant wild-type and mutant Mbs were expressed in TB1 Escherichia coli and purified as reported previously (17Tanaka M. Morishima I. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45470-45475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The concentration of ferric Mbs was determined by the extinction coefficient of 157 mm–1 · cm–1 at the Soret band in the UV-visible spectra. The sample solutions of Mbs in 10 mm MOPS buffer at pH 7.0 were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min, before incubation at 37 °C, to remove any pre-existing precipitates.Congo Red Binding Assay—We incubated 100 μl of 1.86 mg/ml Mb-Gln50 and Mb-Gln35 and 4.49 mg/ml Mb-Gln35, Mb-Gln12 and Mb-WT solutions at 37 °C. We also incubated the supernatant fraction (1.86 mg/ml) of a Mb-Gln50 solution, which was pre-incubated at 37 °C for 6 h at 37 °C. The pellet of the Mb-Gln50 solution, which was pre-incubated for 6 h, was resuspended with 100 μl of 10 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.0) and seeded into fresh 1.86 mg/ml Mb-Gln50 and 4.49 mg/ml Mb-Gln35 solutions (10% (v/v)). At appropriate time points, 5 μl of the protein solutions was added to 10 μm Congo red in 10 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.0) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. UV-visible spectra of these samples were measured with a Shimadzu 2400-PC spectrophotometer. Congo red bound to fibril was determined using the following equation: Congo red (μmol/l) = A 540/25,295 – A 480/46,306 (8Hartley D.M. Walsh D.M. Ye C.P. Diehl T. Vasquez S. Vassilev P.M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8876-8884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Small-angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS)—The measurement of SAXS was performed by synchrotron radiation of RIKEN structural biology beamline I (BL45XU) at Spring-8 in Harima, Japan (19Fujisawa T. Inoue K. Oka T. Iwamoto H. Uruga T. Kunmasaka T. Inoko Y. Yagi N. Yamamoto M. Ueki T. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 797-800Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The sample-to-detector distance was 1 or 2.2 m, which was calibrated using meridional diffraction of dried chicken collagen. The temperature of the sample was maintained at 37 °C by an incubator, and the sample cell and stage were also set to 37 °C. Using an x-ray image intensifier and cooled CCD detector (XR-II+CCD) (20Ameyama Y. Ito K. Yagi N. Asano Y. Wakabayashi K. Ueki T. Endo T. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1995; 66: 2290-2294Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar), each scattering profile was collected for 1 s during which no radiation damage was found. The data were normalized to the intensity of the incident beam, and the buffer was subtracted. The radius of gyration (R g) was determined by the Guinier approximation: I(S) = I(0) exp(–4π2 Rg 2 S 2/3), where S and I(0) are the momentum transfer and intensity at the zero scattering angle, respectively, with fitting ranges of S 2 (Å–2) from 5 × 10–6 to 40 × 10–6. S is defined as S = 2sinθ/λ, where 2θ and λ are the scattering angle and the x-ray wavelength, respectively (21Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-angle Scattering of X-rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar). The S range used for R g determination satisfied the condition 2π SR g < 1.3. The distance distribution function, P(r), was calculated by GNOM, which uses an indirect Fourier transform method (22Svergun D.I. Semenyuk A.V. Feigin L.A. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1988; 44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The maximum dimension, D max, was determined from the first zero cross-point of the P(r) function (21Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-angle Scattering of X-rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar). The cross-sectional radius of gyration, R c, was determined by fitting the data points, using the equation I(S)S = I c (0)exp(–π2 R c2 S 2/2) over S2 ranges (Å–2) from 2 × 10–6 to 10 × 10–6 and from 8 × 10–6 to 23 × 10–6 for oligomer and quasi-aggregates, respectively. The spectral analysis by singular value deconvolution (SVD) was performed using SPECFIT (version 3.0, Spectrum Software Associates, Marlborough, MA), using the S versus S 2×I(S) (Kratky) plot of the data.Construction of Low-resolution Model—Low-resolution particle shapes were restored from SAXS intensity profiles using a bead modeling procedure of DAMMIN (23Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). In the dummy atom minimization (DAMMIN), a protein molecule was approximated by densely packed small spheres (dummy atoms). Minimization was performed by the simulated annealing method (22Svergun D.I. Semenyuk A.V. Feigin L.A. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1988; 44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar), starting from the dummy atoms placed at random coordinates within the search sphere, sphere of diameter D max. The detailed procedure of DAMMIN has been described previously (24Fujisawa T. Kostyukova A. Maeda Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The stability of the model was checked by repeating the minimization 10 times in different runs. The three-dimensional models were displayed using the program VMD.Electron Microscopy and Immunoblotting—The negative staining for the 1.86 mg/ml of sample of Mb-Gln50 and the 4.49 mg/ml of samples of Mb-Gln35, Mb-Gln12, and Mb-WT was performed as reported previously (17Tanaka M. Morishima I. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45470-45475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the images were recorded on a LEO 912AB electron microscope (LEO, Cambridge, UK) normally at a magnification of 63,000 × g. For immunoelectron microscopy of Mb, the copper grid was treated with a polyclonal Mb (1:250–500, Chemicon) or 1C2 antibody (1:50–100, Chemicon), followed by a 5-nm gold-conjugated rabbit or mouse secondary antibody, respectively (1:200, Amersham Biosciences). Each 1.86 mg/ml of sample of Mb-Gln50 with various incubations (0, 3, 10, 24, and 72 h) at 37 °C was also processed to immunoblotting by the Mb (1:5000) and 1C2 (1:2000) antibodies.X-ray Diffraction Experiment—The sample-to-detector distance was 30 cm, which was calibrated using meridional diffraction of dried chicken collagen. Mb-Gln50 and Mb-Gln35 fibrils grown from ∼5 mg/ml of solution in 10 mm MOPS buffer at pH 7.0 were collected by brief centrifugation and mounted onto the last guard slit with a width of 0.6 mm. The sample-to-detector distance was 30 cm. The sample holder was vacuumized to remove the scattering of air, and the fibrils were exposed to x-ray radiation operating at ∼90 mA. Data were collected at room temperature for 30 s on a modified RIGAKU R-Axis IV2+ imaging plate detector. 2Y. Nishikawa and T. Fujisawa, unpublished results.Size Exclusion Chromatography—A 1.86 mg/ml of solution of Mb-Gln50 and 4.49 mg/ml of solutions of Mb-Gln35 and Mb-Gln12 were incubated at 37 °C, and 40 μl of each sample at 3, 10, and 24 h was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography using the Superdex-200 in the SMART system (Amersham Biosciences). The running buffer was 10 mm MOPS containing 150 mm NaCl at pH 7.0, and the flow rate was 40 μl/min.RESULTSFormation of Quasi-aggregate by Expanded Polyglutamine—We examined the fibril formation of mutant Mbs by a Congo red binding assay. We incubated separate solutions (1.86 mg/ml) of Mb-Gln50 and Mb-Gln35 at 37 °C and determined the amount of Congo red bound to fibril, using UV-visible spectroscopy (8Hartley D.M. Walsh D.M. Ye C.P. Diehl T. Vasquez S. Vassilev P.M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8876-8884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The time-dependent profiles showed that the fibril formation of Mb-Gln50 was initiated in ∼50 h, whereas Mb-Gln35 did not clearly exhibit fibrillization within 200 h (Fig. 1A). We then increased the concentration of a Mb-Gln35 solution from 1.86 mg/ml to 4.49 mg/ml and examined the fibril formation by the Congo red binding assay. The 4.49 mg/ml of solution of Mb-Gln35 formed fibrils slowly with a lag time of ∼150 h (Fig. 1A). Contrary to Mb-Gln50 and Mb-Gln35, 4.49 mg/ml of solutions of Mb-Gln12 and Mb-WT did not show the binding to Congo red upon incubation >200 h (Fig. 1A), indicating no fibril formation as reported previously (17Tanaka M. Morishima I. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45470-45475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We also verified that the lag time of fibrillization did not change when we used mutant Mbs of different sample preparations.Because Mb-Gln50 and Mb-Gln35 formed fibrils under the physiological condition, we examined the early phase of fibrillization of the mutant Mbs by SAXS. We incubated separate solutions (1.86 mg/ml) of the mutant Mbs at 37 °C and measured their SAXS spectra with various incubation times. The Guinier plot of Mb-Gln50 showed an increase in the intensity at S 2 = ∼1 × 10–3 Å–2 upon incubation at 37 °C, suggesting formation of an assembled species of the mutant Mb (data not shown). We plotted the scattering profiles of Mb-Gln50 as S versus S 2 × I(S) (Kratky plot) to clarify the protein assembly. As shown in Fig. 1B, an intensity of the peak at S = 1.4 × 10–3 Å–1 was clearly increased with incubation times. The peak showed a maximum scattering intensity in ∼3 h of incubation, and the intensity was constant until 27 h (Fig. 1C). Because a peak at the extremely small-angle region (S = 1.4 × 10–3 Å–1) corresponds to a large-sized particle, our result indicated that a largely assembled Mb-Gln50 was formed in the early time of the lag phase (∼50 h) of fibrillization. Hereafter, we referred such a largely assembled species of protein, which was formed in the early stage of the Mb-Gln50 fibrillization, as a quasi-aggregate. In contrast to Mb-Gln50, SAXS spectra of a 1.86 mg/ml of solution of Mb-Gln35 did not change upon incubation at 37 °C for more than 20 h, suggesting an absence of such an assembled species of protein as observed for Mb-Gln50 (data not shown). Thus, we measured SAXS spectra of a 4.49 mg/ml of solution of Mb-Gln35 (Fig. 1D), which facilitated the fibril formation as shown in Fig. 1A. However, the peak at S = 1.0 × 10–3 Å–1 did not increase with incubation times (Fig. 1E), which confirmed the absence of an assembled species of protein in the early stage of the fibrillization for Mb-Gln35. In addition, we did not detect any peak at the extremely small-angle region in SAXS spectra for Mb-Gln12 and Mb-WT upon incubation at 37 °C over 50 h, indicating absence of any largely assembled species of protein (data not shown). The reliability of time-dependent SAXS spectra was verified by repeating measurements with mutant Mbs of different sample preparations and with different incubation times.To gain more physico-chemical insights into the formation of the quasi-aggregate of Mb-Gln50, we measured time-dependent SAXS spectra at various temperatures (25, 29, 33, and 37 °C) for Mb-Gln50. The formation of quasi-aggregates was greatly affected by temperature, and representative scattering profiles at 25 °C and 33 °C are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. The scattering intensity at S = 1.4 × 10–3 Å–1 was plotted against incubation times, and the formation rate of the quasi-aggregate was calculated. We found that these plots were best fitted by a single exponential (Fig. 2C), indicating that the formation of the quasi-aggregate follows the first-order kinetics. We also show an Arrhenius plot of the formation rate of the Mb-Gln50 quasi-aggregate in Fig. 2D. The activation energy for the formation of the quasi-aggregate was calculated from the slope of the Arrhenius plot (22.8 ± 1.8 kcal/mol). Furthermore, we examined the effects of the Mb-Gln50 quasi-aggregate on fibrillization of Mb-Gln50 or Mb-Gln35 by the Congo red binding assay. Elimination of the quasi-aggregate, which accumulated upon incubation at 37 °C for 6 h, in the Mb-Gln50 sample prolonged a lag time of fibrillization from ∼50 to ∼70 h (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, addition of the Mb-Gln50 quasi-aggregate into a fresh Mb-Gln50 or Mb-Gln35 solution as a seed eliminated or shortened the lag time, respectively (Fig. 1A).Fig. 2Temperature-dependent formation of Mb-Gln50 quasi-aggregate. Representative S versus S 2 × I(S) (Kratky) plots at 25 °C(A) and 33 °C (B) are shown. C, the plots of the scattering intensity at S = 1.4 × 10–3 Å–1 against the incubation time at 25 °C (•), 29 °C (▪), 33 °C (▴), and 37 °C (▾) were best fitted by a single exponential, which allowed determination of the formation rate of the quasi-aggregate at various temperatures. D, an Arrhenius plot (ln(k app) versus K –1) for the formation rate of the quasi-aggregate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We ascertained the formation of quasi-aggregate by electron microscopy. We carried out the negative staining for mutant Mbs, which had been incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, and observed them by electron microscopy. A typical electron micrograph is shown in Fig. 3A. We clearly detected particles with a length of ∼20–45 nm in the Mb-Gln50 sample, whereas such particles were not observed for Mb-Gln35, Mb-Gln12, and Mb-WT samples (data not shown). This electron micrograph suggested that the observed particles for Mb-Gln50 correspond to the quasi-aggregate, which was indicated in the SAXS experiment for Mb-Gln50 (Fig. 1B), because the formation of quasi-aggregate was completed in 3 h (Fig. 1B). We further performed an immunoelectron microscopic study for the quasi-aggregate with a polyclonal Mb and a monoclonal 1C2 antibody (18Trottier Y. Lutz Y. Stevanin G. Imbert G. Devys D. Cancel G. Saudou F. Weber C. David G. Tora L. et al.Nature. 1995; 378: 403-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Although some of the quasi-aggregates initiate to assemble each other by further incubation during the immunostaining procedure, the quasi-aggregate reacted with both of the Mb and 1C2 antibodies (Fig. 3, B and C). We also investigated the reactivity of these antibodies to the Mb-Gln50 fibrils that were formed by incubation at 37 °C for 7 days. The Mb antibody reacted with the fibrils along the fibers (Fig. 3D), whereas the 1C2 antibody recognized only ends and branch sites of the fibrils (Fig. 3E). We further investigated this observation by the following immunoblotting experiment. Each sample of Mb-Gln50 with various incubations (0, 3, 10, 24, and 72 h) were separated by SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting by the Mb and 1C2 antibodies. We focused on the gel top in the immunoblot, because the quasi-aggregate and/or fibril can be detected at the gel top. We found a clear difference in the immunoreactivity to the gel top in 72 h between the Mb and 1C2 antibodies. Although the Mb antibody stained the gel top in 72 h, the reactivity of the 1C2 antibody to the gel top was obviously decreased in 72 h (Fig. 3F).Fig. 3Electron micrographs and an immunoblot of Mb-Gln50 quasi-aggregate and fibril.

Scale bar, 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Furthermore, we followed the morphological changes of Mb-Gln50 upon incubation at 37 °C for 1 to ∼7 days, using electron microscopy. The quasi-aggregates of Mb-Gln50 were associated with each other to form largely assembled clusters, but fibrils were not observed at 1 day (data not shown), whereas fibrils were clearly detected at 3 days. We display typical electron micrographs of Mb-Gln50 at 3 or 5 days in Fig. 3, G–I. In the electron micrographs, we frequently observed the fibrils that were connected to and associated with clusters of the quasi-aggregates (arrow, Fig. 3, G–I).Models of Mb-Gln 50 Monomer, Oligomer, and Quasi-aggregates—To gain more structural information on the quasi-aggregate, we attempted to perform SVD analysis for the time-dependent SAXS spectra. Because the SVD analysis required more data points in the first h of protein fibrillization, we measured SAXS of Mb-Gln50 (1.86 mg/ml), again in shorter incubation intervals from 1 to 60 min at 37 °C (Fig. 4A). The resultant 11 scattering profiles were analyzed using SPECFIT. The SVD analysis showed two species, and the scattering profiles were best fitted by single exponentials. This analysis together with the presence of an isoscattering point at S = 4.4 × 10–3 Å–1 in the SAXS spectra (Fig. 4A) indicated that this reaction follows the first-order kinetics. Therefore, we deconvoluted the time-dependent SAXS profiles of Mb-Gln50 into two spectra, which displayed the scattering profiles of the initial (0 min) and final (60 min) states of Mb-Gln50. In the first-order kinetic scheme, the scattering profile of the final state (60 min) corresponded to that of the quasi-aggregate. We calculated Kratky plots of the two states of Mb-Gln50 and show them in Fig. 4B. From the scattering profiles, we calculated R g values of the initial and final states of Mb-Gln50 (68 and 146 Å, respectively). We realized that the initial state (0 min) was not a monomer but an oligomer, because the R g of 68 Å was larger than that of the Mb-Gln50 monomer (27 Å) (25Tanaka M. Machida Y. Nishikawa Y. Akagi T. Morishima I. Hashikawa T. Fujisawa T. Nukina N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10277-10286Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We found, by SAXS and dynamic light scattering analyses, that the Mb-Gln50 monomer is rarely isolated as a complete monomeric state and that some oligomerized species are formed during the purification. From the SAXS spectra, we also calculated cross-sectional radii of gyration, R c, of the Mb-Gln50 oligomer (30 Å) and quasi-aggregate (92 Å). In addition, D max values of the oligomer (213 Å) and quasi-aggregate (463 Å) were determined by the pair distance distribution functions using GNOM. We found that these values were not changed by different data sets, confirming the reliability of the scattering profiles of the Mb-Gln50 oligomer and quasi-aggregate. We summarized the structural parameters of the Mb-Gln50 monomer, oligomer, and quasi-aggregate in Table I.Fig. 4Molecular models of Mb-Gln50 oligomer and quasi-aggregate. A, time-dependent S"
https://openalex.org/W2141262527,"Human chymase is a chymotryptic serine peptidase stored and secreted by mast cells. Compared with other chymotryptic enzymes, such as cathepsin G and chymotrypsin, it is much more slowly inhibited by serum serpins. Although chymase hydrolyzes several peptides and proteins in vitro, its target repertoire is limited compared with chymotrypsin because of selective interactions in an extended substrate-binding site. The best-known natural substrate, angiotensin I, is cleaved to generate vasoactive angiotensin II. Selectivity of angiotensin cleavage depends in major part on interactions involving substrate residues on the carboxyl-terminal (P1′–P2′) side of the cleaved bond. To identify new targets based on interactions with residues on the aminoterminal (P4–P1) side of the site of hydrolysis, we profiled substrate preferences of recombinant human chymase using a combinatorial, fluorogenic peptide substrate library. Data base queries using the peptide (Arg-Glu-Thr-Tyr-X) generated from the most preferred amino acid at each subsite identify albumin as the sole, soluble, human extracellular protein containing this sequence. We validate the prediction that this site is chymase-susceptible by showing that chymase hydrolyzes albumin uniquely at the predicted location, with the resulting fragments remaining disulfide-linked. The site of hydrolysis is highly conserved in vertebrate albumins and is near predicted sites of metal cation binding, but nicking by chymase does not alter binding of Cu2+ or Zn2+. A synthetic peptidic inhibitor, diphenyl N α-benzoxycarbonyl-l-Arg-Glu-Thr-PheP-phosphonate, was designed from the preferred P4–P1 substrate sequence. This inhibitor is highly potent (IC50 3.8 nm) and 2,700- and 1,300-fold selective for chymase over cathepsin G and chymotrypsin, respectively.

Schwartz L.B. Cooke D. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2475-2482PubMed Google Scholar). Secreted chymase is inhibited by α1-antichymotrypsin and other circulating antipeptidases (9Schechter N.M. Sprows J.L.

For example, chymase is the major extravascular source of vasoactive angiotensin II (11Urata H. Kinoshita A. Misono K.S. Bumpus F.M. Husain A. J. Biol.

The range of potential plasma-derived targets is large, especially in settings of vascular leakage provoked by co-released mast cell histamine.

Biol. 1999; 286: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Differences in substrate specificity among individual members of this large family of peptidases arise from variations in the surface topography of amino acid backbone and side chains lining the substrate-binding cleft. The enzyme active site can be divided into a series of subsites interacting with particular substrate residues. In reference to the peptide substrate, we use standard nomenclature (26Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), with peptide bond amidolysis occurring between P1 and P1′ in theoretical substrate Pn... P3, P2, P1, P1′, P2′, P3′.. .Pn′, where each P is an amino acid. The most critical interaction occurs in the primary specificity pocket, which accommodates the side chain of the P1 amino acid. This side chain is aromatic for chymases and other chymotryptic enzymes. In the case of chymase-mediated hydrolysis of angiotensin I, interactions involving P1, P1′, and P2′ are particularly important (24McGrath M.E. Mirzadegan T. Schmidt B.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14318-14324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Pereira P.J.B. Wang Z.M. Rubin H. Huber R. Bode W. Schechter N.M. Strobl S. J. Mol.

However, for many serine peptidases (including chymase and cathepsin G hydrolyzing other peptide substrates), interactions on the other side of P1 (involving P4, P3, and P2) critically influence substrate binding and hydrolysis (29Powers J.C. Tanaka T. Harper J.W. Minematsu Y. Barker L. Lincoln D. Crumley K.V. Fraki J.E. Schechter N.M. Lazarus G.G. Nakajima K. Nakashino K. Neurath H. Woodbury R.G.

In the current work, we probe the substrate preferences of human chymase at P4–P1 using a combinatorial substrate library containing most combinations of natural amino acids at each subsite position. The results successfully predict chymase-mediated hydrolysis of a new protein target, human serum albumin (HSA). 1The abbreviations used are: HSA, human serum albumin; rh, recombinant human; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; 5-Br-PAPS, 2-(5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-(N-n-propyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl)amino) phenol; RETY, Arg-Glu-Thr-Tyr; Z-RETF-(OPh)2, diphenyl N α-benzoxycarbonyl-l-Arg-Glu-Thr-PheP-phosphonate; MeOsuc-AAPF-(OPh)2, diphenyl N α-methoxysuccinyl-l-Ala-Ala-Pro-PheP-phosphonate; suc-AAPF-NA, succinyl-N α-l-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide. A synthetic, peptidic inhibitor based on this cleavage site is a potent, selective inhibitor of chymase. Expression, Purification, and Activation of Recombinant Human Chymase—For the studies described in this report, we generated recombinant human (rh) prochymase in insect (Trichoplusia ni) cells as previously described (14Caughey G.H. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Briefly, rhprochymase was purified by high performance heparin-affinity chromatography and then activated by incubation with dipeptidylpeptidase I. The activated preparation was repurified by heparin-affinity chromatography to remove dipeptidylpeptidase. The repurified enzyme was pure by SDS-PAGE and amino-terminal sequence analysis and was highly active, with a specific activity of 177 μmol min–1 mg–1 versus succinyl-l-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-4-nitroanilide (suc-AAPF-NA; Sigma) under standard conditions (14Caughey G.H. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This activity closely matches that of native human chymase tested under identical substrate and assay conditions (9Schechter N.M. Sprows J.L. Schoenberger O.L. Lazarus G.S. Cooperman B.S. Rubin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21308-21315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Screening with Combinatorial, Fluorogenic Peptide Libraries—To profile rhchymase preferences at substrate positions P4–P1, we followed the general approaches described previously for selected other serine peptidases (31Harris J.L. Backes B.J. Leonetti F. Mahrus S. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 32Harris J.L. Niles A. Burdick K. Maffitt M.

Briefly, to probe the influence of the P1 residue, we used rhchymase to screen a P1-diverse library of soluble positional protease substrates with 160,000 members, each containing the fluorogenic leaving group 7-amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin. This library contains substrate amino acid diversity at positions P4, P3, P2, P1 (31Harris J.L. Backes B.J. Leonetti F. Mahrus S. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), with each position varying in 20 amino acids (omitting Cys and adding Ile). The P1-diverse library consists of 20 wells, in each of which only the P1 residue remains constant, with each of the remaining sites containing equimolar mixtures of 20 amino acids for a total of 8,000 sequences per well. Similarly, the extended P4–P2 specificity of rhchymase was explored by fixing the residue at the desired position in a given well. Assays were performed at 25 °C in 50 ml Tris (pH 8.0), 100 ml NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, and 1% Me2SO. Final concentration for each substrate compound was 10 nl. Substrate hydrolysis was initiated by addition of enzyme (10 nl) and monitored fluorometrically with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 450 nm. Molecular Modeling of Human Chymase with a Predicted Best Substrate—We used SwissModel and SwisspdbViewer software (33Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) to model the best substrate identified by combinatorial screening. The starting point for the model was the crystal-based structure of rhchymase bound to (and inactivated by) suc-AAPF-chloromethylketone (25Pereira P.J.B. Wang Z.M. Rubin H. Huber R. Bode W. Schechter N.M. Strobl S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which attaches covalently to chymase's active site histidine. The suc-AAP moiety was exchanged for residues P4, P3, P2 of the identified best substrate. Incubation of Albumin with Chymotryptic Peptidases and Identification of Sites of Hydrolysis—Recombinant chymase was incubated with HSA (enzyme to substrate molar ratio of 1:83) at 37 °C in PBS. The source of HSA was fraction V albumin (Sigma). The latter was further purified by high performance anion exchange chromatography (MonoQ column; Amersham Biosciences) to remove traces of impurities such as serpin-class serine peptidase inhibitors. The reaction was quenched by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and the products of hydrolysis subjected to reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE. To establish the rate of hydrolysis, 5 pmol of chymase were incubated with 1 nmol of HSA in 50 μl of PBS at 37 °C. At various times, aliquots were removed and chymase inactivated by addition of glacial acetic acid. Products were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue-stained bands were quantitated by densitometry. In separate experiments, chymasecleaved HSA was electrophoresed and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The larger of the two new bands generated by chymase was excised and sequenced from the amino terminus by Edman degradation (Midwest Analytical, St. Louis, MO). To compare effects of chymase with those of other chymotryptic peptidases, HSA was incubated in parallel experiments with human cathepsin G (Elastin Products, St. Louis, MO) and bovine α-chymotrypsin (Sigma) using amounts of enzyme producing equal rates of hydrolysis of suc-AAPF-NA under similar conditions. Molecular Modeling of Albumin—To model HSA in the vicinity of the chymase hydrolysis site, we used the RasMol molecular visualization program and an x-ray diffraction-derived structure of HSA co-crystallized with arachidonate (Protein Data Bank identifier 1gnj; Ref. 34Petitpas I. Grune T. Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Analysis of Metal Cation Binding to Albumin—We evaluated the effect of chymase cleavage of HSA on Zn2+ and Cu2+ binding by competitive spectrophotometry (35Ohyoshi E. Hamada Y. Nakata K. Kohata S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1999; 75: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Unbound Zn2+ or Cu2+ in a solution of HSA was detected using a metal-binding indicator ligand, 2-(5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-(N-n-propyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl)amino)phenol (5-Br-PAPS; Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan), which competes with HSA for metal cations and changes spectrally when bound to Zn2+, as described in Ref. 35Ohyoshi E. Hamada Y. Nakata K. Kohata S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1999; 75: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar. Briefly, 2.5–7.5 μl HSA in 20 ml Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and 150 ml NaCl was incubated for1hat37 °C with or without 70 nl rhchymase followed by addition of 10 μl 5-Br-PAPS. Change in absorbance at 446 nm was measured after each of six sequential additions of ZnSO4 in 0.5-μl increments. Measurements without HSA also were made to assess binding of Zn2+ to 5-Br-PAPS in the absence of competitor. After these determinations, samples containing HSA were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to assess extent of cleavage by chymase. The effect of hydrolysis of HSA on binding to Cu2+ was assessed similarly. Testing of Peptide-based Chymase Inhibitors—A diphenyl phosphonate ester transition-state analog inhibitor based on the best tetrapeptide substrate identified by combinatorial screening of the substrate library was obtained from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). This inhibitor, diphenyl N α-benzoxycarbonyl-l-Arg-Glu-Thr-PheP-phosphonate (Z-RETF-(OPh)2) was constructed with an analog of Phe rather than Tyr at the P1 position for ease of synthesis. As shown under “Results,” Phe is nearly as favored as Tyr in the combinatorial screening assay. Performance of this inhibitor was compared with that of a traditional chymase inhibitor, diphenyl N α-methoxysuccinyl-l-Ala-Ala-Pro-PheP-phosphonate (MeOsuc-AAPF-(OPh)2) and with diphenyl phosphonates based on a series of Phe-based, chloromethylketone-class chymase inhibitors reported by Hayashi et al. (36Hayashi Y. Iijima K. Katada J. Kiso Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000; 10: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The series used here includes benzoyl-l-PheP-(OPh)2, 2-phenyl-acetyl-PheP-(OPh)2, 3-phenyl-propionyl-PheP-(OPh)2, and 4-phenyl-butyryl-PheP-(OPh)2 and were obtained from Enzyme Systems Products. The concentration of diphenyl phosphonate producing 50% inhibition (IC50) of rhchymase, cathepsin G, and α-chymotrypsin was determined for each of the compounds at an enzyme concentration of 0.5 nl using the chromogenic substrate suc-AAPF-NA (0.2 ml). The effects of Z-RETF-(OPh)2 and MeOsuc-AAPF-(OPh)2 were tested in two buffer conditions, standard “high-salt” chymase assay buffer (0.45 l Tris-HCL, pH 8, 1.8 l NaCl, 9% Me2SO) (9Schechter N.M. Sprows J.L. Schoenberger O.L. Lazarus G.S. Cooperman B.S. Rubin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21308-21315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PBS (pH 7.4) with 10% Me2SO. P1 Subsite Preferences Predicted by the Combinatorial Substrate Library—As shown in Fig. 1, the combinatorial peptide screen finds the most striking preferences at the P1 position in comparison with positions P2–P4, with Tyr slightly preferred over Phe. All other P1 choices are a distant second. Unlike cathepsin G, a related serine peptidase with chymotryptic activity that is co-expressed with chymase in human mast cells (37Schechter N.M. Irani A.M. Sprows J.L. Abernethy J. Wintroub B. Schwartz L.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2652-2661PubMed Google Scholar, 38Polanowska J. Krokoszynska I. Czapinska H. Watorek W. Dadlez M. Otlewski J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and duodenases, which are expressed in ruminant mast cells (39Pemberton A.D. Huntley J.F. Miller H.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), human chymase lacks “dual specificity,” i.e. an ability to hydrolyze both tryptic and chymotryptic substrates. There is only a small tendency to cleave fluorogenic substrates with P1 Trp or Leu. This contrasts with preferences of pancreatic chymotrypsin tested in the same system (31Harris J.L. Backes B.J. Leonetti F. Mahrus S. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), which reveals a proportionately much higher ability to hydrolyze substrates with P1 Trp and Leu. The limited affinity of chymase for substrates with these P1 residues perhaps is explained by characteristics of the so-called primary specificity pocket, as assessed in crystallized versions of the human enzyme (24McGrath M.E. Mirzadegan T. Schmidt B.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14318-14324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Pereira P.J.B. Wang Z.M. Rubin H. Huber R. Bode W. Schechter N.M. Strobl S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This pocket may be too small to accommodate the indole side chain of Trp easily but too large to develop strong binding interactions with the aliphatic side chain of Leu. Nonetheless, as shown in Table I, Trp or Leu does occupy the P1 site in some targets of human chymase. However, P1 is Tyr or Phe in a generous majority of identified natural substrates. It is worth noting that targets hydrolyzed by chymase at P1 Trp (profilins) and P1 Leu (procollagen and procollagenase) are large proteins. In the case of profilin, the vulnerable P1 Trp appears to be exposed on the protein surface (23Mellon M.B. Frank B.T. Fang K.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Such exposure may be as important in determining the ability of chymase to hydrolyze a target as the subsite preferences under study here. Presumably, many uncleaved target sequences in proteins would be cleaved by chymases if they were incorporated into peptides rather than buried in the hydrophobic interior of the protein, as is the case for most aromatic amino acids in globular proteins. P2–P4 Subsite Preferences—As shown in Fig. 1, there is little tolerance for aromatic or basic residues at either P2 or P3. However, a variety of hydrophilic, neutral, and acidic amino acids are accepted at P2, the best being Thr. The P3 position, unlike P2, tolerates Pro poorly and prefers Glu slightly to several other acceptable amino acids. Finally, at the P4 subsite, Arg is preferred about 2-fold over any other choice. Acidic residues (Asp and Glu) are poor, and Gly is worst. Note that effects of the best residues in positions P2–P4 on substrate cleavage rate is generally much less than that of the P1 Phe and Tyr residues, hence the differences in scale in the graphs depicted in Fig. 1. Overall, the restricted range of preferences for each position can be summarized as follows: P4, Xaa (slightly Arg); P3, Glu/Ser/Thr; P2, Thr/Pro; P1, Tyr/Phe. A consensus substrate based on the single most preferred amino acid at each position is Arg-Glu-Thr-Tyr (RETY). Comparison with Prior Efforts to Profile the Chymase Active Site—Aside from a finding that P1 Phe is slightly preferred over Tyr in selected nitroanilide substrates, our data are consistent with prior results obtained with panels of peptidyl 4-NAs varying at P1 (29Powers J.C. Tanaka T. Harper J.W. Minematsu Y. Barker L. Lincoln D. Crumley K.V. Fraki J.E. Schechter N.M. Lazarus G.G. Nakajima K. Nakashino K. Neurath H. Woodbury R.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2048-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As was predicted previously in a selected series of peptidyl 4-NAs (29Powers J.C. Tanaka T. Harper J.W. Minematsu Y. Barker L. Lincoln D. Crumley K.V. Fraki J.E. Schechter N.M. Lazarus G.G. Nakajima K. Nakashino K. Neurath H. Woodbury R.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2048-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), Pro is one of the most favored P2 residues, although this preference is uncommon among proteases, including others profiled with combinatorial, fluorogenic substrates (31Harris J.L.

However, the best P2 residue identified by our profiling method is Thr, a finding that did not emerge from previous attempts to characterize preferences at this subsite. The relative intolerance of P3 for aromatic residues in our study contrasts somewhat with the study by Powers et al. (29Powers J.C. Tanaka T. Harper J.W. Minematsu Y. Barker L. Lincoln D.

Here we demonstrate that Nicastrin-deficient mice showed a phenotype that is indistinguishable from PS1/PS2 double knock-out mice, whereas heterozygotes were healthy and viable. Fibroblasts derived from Nicastrin-deficient embryos were unable to generate amyloid β-peptide and failed to release the intracellular domain of APP- or Notch1-Gal4-VP16 fusion proteins. Additionally, C- and N-terminal fragments of PS1 and the C-terminal fragments of PS2 were not detectable in Nicastrin-null fibroblasts, whereas full-length PS1 accumulated in null fibroblasts, indicating that Nicastrin is required for the endoproteolytic processing of presenilins. Interestingly, cells derived from Nicastrin heterozygotes produced relatively higher levels of amyloid β-peptide whether the source was endogenous mouse or transfected human APP. These data demonstrate that Nicastrin is essential for the γ-secretase cleavage of APP and Notch in mammalian cells and that Nicastrin has both positive and negative functions in the regulation of γ-secretase activity.

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the progressive accumulation of cerebral deposition of 39–42-amino-acid peptides, termed β-amyloid (Aβ). 1The abbreviations used are: Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; APP, amyloid β-protein precursor; PS1, presenilin-1; KO, knock-out; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NTF, N-terminal fragment; CTF, C-terminal fragment; E, embyro day; CMV, cytomegalovirus; UAS, upstream activating sequence; Luc, luciferase.

By comparison, the requirement of PS genes for the intramembraneous cleavage of APP and Notch has been demonstrated not only in mammalian cells (4Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D.

The goal of the present study was to elucidate the function of Nicastrin in the mouse by generating a genetic knock-out (KO) animal. Here we demonstrate that Nicastrin-deficient mice showed features similar to PS1/PS2 double KO mice, including Notch phenotypic embryonic lethality and abolition of Aβ production as well as the release of APP or Notch intracellular domain. Additionally, our data demonstrate that Nicastrin is required for the endoproteolytic processing of presenilins. Generation of Nicastrin Knock-out Mouse Line—A targeting vector was designed to effectively delete the N-terminal 63 amino acids of Nicastrin by replacement with an IRESlacZ/MC1neo cassette (28Wattler S. Kelly M. Nehls M. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 1150-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This resulted in the removal of 1530 genomic bases, including a portion of exon 1 beginning 3 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon and extending into intron 2. After targeted 129/SvEvBrd embryonic stem cells were verified by Southern blot using 5′-external and 3′-internal probes, male chimeras were generated by blastocyst microinjection and were mated to C57BL/6 albino females. Agouti offspring heterozygotes for the Nicastrin KO allele were used for continued backcross to C57BL/6 mice to establish a colony for subsequent experiments. Embryonic Analysis—Midday of the plug day was designated as embryo day 0.5 (E0.5). Embryos were dissected in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline from timed pregnant females and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed as described (29Henrique D. Adam J. Myat A. Chitnis A. Lewis J. Ish-Horowicz D. Nature. 1995; 375: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). The template for Nicastrin in situ probe was generated by PCR using primers AF (5′-TGACTCTAGCCAAGCCCAACTCAACT-3′) and AR (5′-GGGAAACTTGCCGTTCTCCATATCAT-3′) and subcloned into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen). Digoxygenin-labeled RNA probe was synthesized using the DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Embryonic Fibroblast Culture—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were isolated by trypsinization of separate embryos at E8–E12. Homogenous cell suspensions were maintained and expanded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells grown less than seven passages were used in the experiments. Recombinant Adenovirus and Infection of Fibroblasts—Human APP695 (A33292) cDNA from the initiation methionine to the stop codon with the Swedish mutation (Lys at position 595 to Asn and Met-596 to Leu) was cloned into pIPspAdapt10DestB, a Gateway vector with an optimized CMV promoter and Ad5 adenovirus backbone (Galapagos Genomics). The recombinant virus was produced and purified by Galapagos Genomics. Viral titer after the final propagation was 1.8 × 1012 viral particle/ml. The fibroblast cells were infected with the recombinant adenovirus with a viral titer of a multiplicity of infection of 100 in culture dishes containing 5 × 104 cells/cm2. Control infections were done using a recombinant adenovirus bearing GFP cDNA (Ad5.CVM-GFP, Biogen) at the same multiplicity of infection. Detection of Aβ in Conditioned Medium—Conditioned medium was collected from the fibroblast cultures for 3 days with the addition of protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science) followed by cell viability assay using the MTS One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega) for normalization of data to viable cell number. Analysis of the conditioned medium for human Aβ1–40 was performed using a liquid phase direct sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to a modified protocol (30Potempska A. Mack K. Mehta P. Kim K.S. Miller D.L. Amyloid. 1999; 6: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For human Aβ1–40, the capture antibodies were 6E10 (Signet) and the secondary biotinylated antibodies were Rb208 for Aβ1–40 (New York State Institute for Basic Research, Staten Island, NY). For mouse Aβ1–40, the capture antibodies were 4G8 (Signet), and the secondary biotinylated antibodies were Rb208. Luciferase Reporter Assay For γ-Cleavage—Fibroblasts that reached 60–80% confluence after 48 h of culture were co-transfected with intracellular domain of mouse Notch1 (Notch1IC) or CT99 fused with Gal4-VP16 (Notch1IC-G4VP16 or CT99-G4VP16, respectively, kind gifts from Urban Lendhal, see Ref. 36Karlstrom H.

Each transfection also included a control reporter thymidine kinase-renilla luciferase construct (pFR-Luc, Stratagene). The cells were lysed 24 h post-transfection and assayed using luciferase detection reagents (Promega) and Lmax luminometer (Amersham Biosciences). The corrected luciferase activity was defined as the ratio of the values of firefly luciferase activity and the values of renilla luciferase activity. Western Blot Analysis—The fibroblast cell cultures at the last day of medium collection were lysed, and a total of 10 μg of protein/lane was loaded on 4–12% Nupage gels (Novex). The blots were probed with the following antibodies separately: rabbit polyclonal antiserum C8KK that was directed to the C-terminal 8 amino acids of APP695 with a dilysine addition (Covance Research Products), rabbit polyclonal anti-PS1-loop antibody recognizing full-length and CTF of PS1, anti-PS1-NTF antibody recognizing full-length PS1 and the NTF, and anti-PS2-loop antibody recognizing full-length PS2 and the CTF (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The anti-loop antibody weakly recognizes the NTF of PS1. 2J. Li, G. J. Fici, C.-A. Mao, R. L. Myers, R. Shuang, G. P. Donoho, A. M. Pauley, C. S. Himes, W. Qin, I. Kola, K. M. Merchant, and J. S.

No obvious abnormalities were observed in Nicastrin+/– mice. Nicastrin–/– embryos began to show somite segmentation defect at embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) and died before E10.5 (Fig. 1a). This phenotype is similar to that of PS1–/–/PS2–/– double KO mice (5Zhang Z. Nadeau P. Song W. Donoviel D. Yuan M. Bernstein A. Yankner B.A. Nat.

The expression of Nicastrin mRNA detected by in situ hybridization was ubiquitous throughout the wild type embryo at E8.5 (Fig. 1b) and E10.5 (data not shown), similar to PS1 expression during early development (27Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Martin L.J. Thinakaran G. Kim G. Gandy S.E. Seeger M. Koo E. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7513-7525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lack of Aβ Production in Nicastrin – / – Fibroblasts—To study the γ-secretase activity in Nicastrin-deficient cells, we derived fibroblasts from the embryos of Nicastrin+/+, +/–, and –/– genotypes at E8–E12 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cells with equivalent passage numbers were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing either GFP or human APP bearing the Swedish familial Alzheimer's disease mutations (APPsw, Lys at position 595 to Asn and Met-596 to Leu) (31Dreyer R.N. Bausch K.M. Fracasso P. Hammond L.J. Wunderlich D. Wirak D.O. Davis G. Brini C.M. Buckholz T.M. Konig G. Kamarck M.E. Tamburini P.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). GFP expression levels after GFP adenovirus infection in cells of all three genotypes were comparable (data not shown). The levels of Aβ1–40 and 1–42 in the conditioned medium were assessed over the course of 3 days of culture, and cell viability and cell extracts were examined on the last day (see “Experimental Procedures”). The conditioned medium of Nicastrin+/+ and Nicastrin+/– fibroblast cultures expressing APPsw showed accumulation of both human Aβ1–40 and 1–42, whereas conditioned medium of Nicastrin–/– cultures showed no detectable human Aβ1–40 or 1–42 (<25 pg/ml) (Fig. 2, a and b). In contrast, APPsw holoprotein expression in the lysates from these cells was comparable between cultures of the different genotypes (Fig. 3). In addition, we were able to measure the production of secreted endogenous mouse Aβ1–40 in Nicastrin+/+ and Nicastrin+/– cell cultures but not in Nicastrin–/– cell cultures (Fig. 2c and data not shown). Mouse Aβ1–42 level in the latter set of cultures was below the detection limit. Interestingly, Nicastrin+/– cells produced significantly higher levels of Aβ1–40 than Nicastrin+/+ cells whether the source was endogenous mouse or transfected human APP (Fig. 2, a–c). This relative increase of Aβ1–40 was also observed in neuronal cell cultures (data not shown). To confirm that Nicastrin is essential for Aβ production, we transfected Nicastrin–/– fibroblasts expressing adenoviral APPsw with Nicastrin cDNA and found that Aβ1–40 production was restored (Fig. 2d and data not shown). Western blot analysis of cell lysates from APP-transfected (or infected) Nicastrin–/– cell cultures showed an enhanced accumulation of APP-CT99, a γ-secretase substrate generated by the β-secretase cleavage of APP, in contrast to Nicastrin+/+ and Nicastrin+/– cell lysates that showed minimal levels of APP-CT99 (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Aβ production was abolished in cells lacking Nicastrin, similar to the results from the PS1/PS2 double KO embryos (23Wong P.C. Zheng H. Chen H.

These reagents provide a quantitative measurement of intracellular release and nuclear access of G4VP16 as measured by the activation of UAS-luciferase. Cells of the three genotypes were co-transfected with CT99-G4VP16 or Notch1IC-G4VP16 together with UAS-Luc reporter followed by the measurement of firefly luciferase activity. These values were divided by the activity of a control thymidine kinase-renilla luciferase reporter that was included in each experiment. The corrected luciferase activity elicited by both CT99 and Notch1IC in Nicastrin–/– cells was dramatically reduced as compared with the wild type and heterozygotes cells (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Nicastrin is required for the intramembraneous cleavage and release of the intracellular domains of APP and Notch in mammalian cells. Failure of Cells to Accumulate Mature PS Proteins in Nicastrin – / – Fibroblasts—To examine the role of Nicastrin in stabilizing the mammalian presenilin complex, we measured levels of endogenous PS1 and PS2 protein levels by Western blot analysis using antibodies recognizing PS1 NTF and CTF. PS1-NTF and -CTF and PS2-CTF levels were detected in the Nicastrin+/+ and Nicastrin+/– cells but were undetectable in the Nicastrin–/– cells (Fig. 5a). Similarly, PS2 CTF was detected in the Nicastrin+/– cells but was undetectable in the Nicastrin–/– cells using an antibody recognizing PS2 holoprotein and the CTF (Fig. 5b). These results were consistent with the previous observations using an RNA interference approach (11Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Furthermore, full-length PS1 was undetectable in the Nicastrin+/– cells but was observed in small amounts in the Nicastrin–/– cells (Fig. 5c). These results demonstrate that Nicastrin is essential for the accumulation or stabilization of mature PS1 fragments and suggest a role of Nicastrin in regulating the abundance of full-length PS1 as well. In contrast to PS1, full-length PS2 was not detected in the Nicastrin–/– cells. Although these data are consistent with differences between the respective roles of Nicastrin on PS1 and PS2 cleavage and/or stability, the relatively weak sensitivity of the antibody to full-length PS2 limits our ability to make such a strong conclusion. The data presented here demonstrate that cells derived from Nicastrin–/– mice fail to produce Aβ and fail to release the intracellular domain of APP-CT99 and Notch1, similar to cells from PS1/PS2 double KO mice (5Zhang Z.

Phenotypically, Nicastrin–/– embryos also resemble PS1/PS2 double KO embryos in displaying somitic abnormalities, indicating severe Notch pathway defects. These findings provide direct evidence of an essential role for Nicastrin in both murine development and the mammalian γ-secretase cleavage of APP and Notch, in agreement with a recent report (38Li T. Ma G. Cai H. Price D.L. Wong P.C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we also observed that the relative levels of endogenous mouse and human Aβ1–40 and 1–42 produced by Nicastrin+/–cells were higher as compared with Nicastrin+/+ cells. This relative increase in Aβ was observed both in neuronal cultures (data not shown) and in fibroblast cultures (Fig. 2) from Nicastrin heterozygous animals. These observations reveal that a partial reduction of Nicastrin expression from diploid to haploid levels stimulates Aβ production. Since Nicastrin is a component of the γ-secretase complex (9Yu G.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the most logical explanation is that the partial deficiency of Nicastrin abrogates a weak inhibitory effect upon the γ-secretase directly, whereas a complete deficiency (or near deficiency, see Ref. 9Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L. Yu H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M. Xu D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E.

Wong P.C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that demonstrate a linear gene dose effect in Aβ secretion. The discrepancy may be related to several differences in experimental procedure including the strategy in generating the Nicastrin-null mice and Aβ measurement. Further studies are required to better understand regulation of Aβ production by Nicastrin. Prior work in Drosophila and mammalian cells treated with small interfering RNA has revealed only an essential or positive role for Nicastrin in the γ-secretase activity. However, a fuller examination of negative regulation by Nicastrin of the γ-secretase remains to be performed. The present studies showing a positive and negative role of Nicastrin in the γ-secretase may fit with prior studies showing mutations in Nicastrin that decrease Aβ production (e.g. Δ312–369) and others that increase it (e.g. D336A/Y337A) (9Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L. Yu H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M. Xu D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E.

Since the results presented here predict that a total and a partial loss of Nicastrin function would give rise to decreased and increased Aβ production, respectively, the published Nicastrin alleles may represent various levels of Nicastrin hypo-function along this continuum. Exactly how the mutated domains of Nicastrin exert their effects upon the γ-secretase remains to be established. In any case, a fuller appreciation of the complexity of the functional role of Nicastrin in γ-secretase regulation, and ultimately Aβ production, will be essential in designing any therapeutic strategy that utilizes Nicastrin as its target. As noted previously, the abundance of mature PS1 and PS2 fragments is dramatically reduced in Nicastrin deficiency. We also observed a small increase in the abundance of PS1 holoprotein in Nicastrin knock-out cells (Fig. 5). At present, it is impossible to discern whether the enhancement of PS1 holoprotein is a consequence of its increased stability or results from a partial suppression of endoproteolysis of PS1. Recent studies have uncovered a role for Pen-2 in the cleavage of PS holoprotein (19Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M. Takahashi Y. Thinakaran G. Iwatsubo T. Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), and by comparison, the deficiency of Pen-2 results in a more robust enhancement in the abundance of PS1 holoprotein than that found in Nicastrin-null cells (19Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M. Takahashi Y. Thinakaran G. Iwatsubo T. Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Since the endoproteolysis of PS proteins, also known as the presenillinase, is also generally dependent upon γ-secretase activity (20Beher D. Wrigley J.D. Nadin A. Evin G. Masters C.L. Harrison T. Castro J.L. Shearman M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45394-45402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it would be logical to observe some decline in the rate of PS endoproteolysis in the absence of a protein that is required for the γ-secretase complex.

Its excessive biosynthesis and secretion is associated with diabetes mellitus.

Glucagon, the second major hormone in the control of glucose homeostasis, acts as a counterregulator to insulin (1Webb G.C. Akbar M.S. Zhao C. Swift H.H. Steiner D.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is synthesized mainly in the pancreatic α cells in most species. However, proglucagon mRNA is also expressed in the enteroendocrine L cells, where it gives rise to GLP1 and -2, and also in some neurones in the central nervous system (2Steiner D. Bell G. Rubenstein A. Chan S. DeGroot L. Jameson J. Endocrinology. 4th Ed. W. B. Saunders, New York2000: 667-696Google Scholar). Its excessive production and secretion is associated with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (3Unger R. Orci L. Ellenberg and Rifkin's Diabetes Mellitus (Porte, D., Jr., and Sherwin, R., eds). 5th ed. Appleton and Lange, Stamford, CT1996Google Scholar). Toward understanding the regulation of glucagon biosynthesis, it has been demonstrated that proglucagon gene expression is regulated by a cAMP-dependent pathway (4Knepel W. Chafitz J. Habener J.F.

Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6799-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, in contrast to the up-regulation of insulin mRNA levels by glucose (10Nielsen D.A. Welsh M. Casadaban M.J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13585-13589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only minor changes in proglucagon mRNA levels occur in response to glucose in cultured islets; the levels tend to increase during culture irrespective of the glucose concentration (11Dumonteil E. Magnan C. Ritz-Laser B. Ktorza A. Meda P. Philippe J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In vivo it is increased during prolonged fasting (12Chen L. Komiya I. Inman L. O'Neil J. Appel M. Alam T. Unger R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The increase or attenuated decrease of proglucagon mRNA at lower glucose concentrations may be a physiological feature of α cells that supports glucagon secretion at low glucose levels. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. ATF3 is a member of the ATF/CREB subfamily of bZip domain proteins (13Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene. 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). It functions by binding to ATF/CRE sites (TGACGTCA, identical to the CRE) or the related activated protein-1 site in DNA (13Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene. 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 14Hsu J.C. Laz T. Mohn K.L. Taub R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Murine ATF3, initially designated as LRG-21 (homologous to rat liver-regenerating factor LRF-1), is composed of 181 aa and contains a bZip domain (residues 88–142) for homo/heterodimer formation and specific DNA binding (15Drysdale B.E. Howard D.L. Johnson R.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The aa sequence homology of mouse ATF3 to the rat or human proteins is 99 and 98%, respectively (15Drysdale B.E. Howard D.L. Johnson R.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Two C-terminal truncated isoforms, ATF3ΔZip and ATF3ΔZip2, which lack the leucine zipper domain, have been isolated from human tissue. These fail to bind to the ATF/CRE sites (16Chen B.P. Liang G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2398-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The corresponding isoforms have not yet been described in rodents. ATF3 expression is relatively low in most cell types under normal conditions but is strongly induced in response to many environmental changes as an immediate early response gene (18Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). It appears to function in the regulation of the cellular stress response and in cell proliferation by forming homo- and selective heterodimers with certain other bZip proteins (13Hai T. Hartman M.G.

Recently, it has been found to be expressed predominantly in α cells within islets. 2J. Wang, G. Webb, Y. Cao, and D. F. Steiner, submitted for publication. Because the CRE/ATF site of the proglucagon gene promoter has been suggested to be bound by other proteins besides CREB (4Knepel W. Chafitz J. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6799-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we have further explored the possibility of proglucagon gene expression regulated by ATF3 in α cells. In the present study, we have characterized a novel alternative spliced isoform, ATF3b, compared the specific binding ability of ATF3b with that of ATF3 to the CRE/ATF site, and further have demonstrated a novel mechanism by which proglucagon gene expression in pancreatic α cells is regulated by glucose and in response to cAMP signals. Cell Culture, Islet Isolation, RNA Preparation—αTC1.6 and NIH3T3 cells were grown in 10% fetal calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) as described (28Hamaguchi K. Leiter E.H. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 415-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Jainchill J.L. Aaronson S.A. Todaro G.J. J. Virol. 1969; 4: 549-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Islet isolation and RNA preparation were described previously (30Wang J. Takeuchi T. Tanaka S. Kubo S.K. Kayo T. Lu D. Takata K. Koizumi A. Izumi T. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Molecular Cloning of ATF3b cDNA—cDNA synthesized by reverse transcription from αTC1.6 total RNA (1 μg) was subjected to PCR as described previously (30Wang J. Takeuchi T. Tanaka S. Kubo S.K. Kayo T. Lu D. Takata K. Koizumi A. Izumi T. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) using primer pairs (from 5′ to 3′) for cloning the coding sequence of ATF3: GGTGGAATTCGAGCGAAGACTGGAGCAAAA (sense) and AACCTCGAGGTGGGGTGGAAAAGGAGGA (antisense). The products (the expected band and a smaller one) were subcloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of the pcDNA3.1 (+) expression vector (Invitrogen). The sequences were determined using an ABI PRISM sequencing kit and compared with the reported ATF3 cDNA and genomic gene sequences. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA of a novel isoform, ATF3b, has been deposited in GenBank™ accession number (pending). RT-PCR, Northern and Western Blotting—These procedures were carried out as described previously (31Wang J. Takeuchi T. Yokota H. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28542-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Using the same primers as described above, total RNA (1 μg) from αTC1.6 and islets was subjected to RT-PCR. 10 μg of total RNA was used for Northern blotting. For Western blotting, whole-cells proteins (50 μg/lane) were separated by Laemmli or Tricine SDS-PAGE and transferred onto an Immobilon-P or -PSQ membrane (Millipore). Antibodies against the C-terminal region of ATF3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and tubulin (Sigma) were purchased commercially. In Vitro Synthesis, Immunoprecipitation, and N-terminal Sequencing of ATF3b Protein—Labeled ATF3 and ATF3b proteins were synthesized using the TnT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) with the plasmids constructed as described above in a mixture containing [35S]methionine or [3H]leucine (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-ATF3 serum, the [35S]- or [3H]-labeled ATF3b protein was diluted in 0.5× TBST buffer (10 mm Tris, 70 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitation and PAGE analysis was carried out as described previously (31Wang J. Takeuchi T. Yokota H. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28542-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For the N-terminal sequencing of ATF3b, the [3H]-labeled ATF3b protein immunoprecipitates were separated on a 16.5% Tricine gel and transferred onto an Immobilon-PSQ membrane. The membrane-bound ATF3b protein band was excised and subjected to N-terminal Edman degradation. Tritium radioactivity of aa fractions released on each cycle was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. EMSA (Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay)—ATF3 and ATF3b proteins were synthesized in vitro as described above. DNA probes (normal, 5′-AGGCTCATTTGACGTCAAAATTCAC-3′; mutant, 5′-AGGCTCATTTGTGGTCAAAATTCAC-3′) were derived from the region containing the CRE/ATF site (underlined) of the mouse proglucagon promoter and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. DNA binding reactions were carried out as follow: aliquots of in vitro translation mixture were incubated in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) containing 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) and 6–20 × 103 counts per minute of DNA probe at room temperature for 10 min. For supershift assays, 0.2 μg of IgG of rabbit anti-ATF3 or control serum was added and the samples incubated for another 10 min. The binding mixture was then applied onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel (0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer) for electrophoresis (25Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol.

Transient Transfection and Luciferase Activity Assay—A cDNA containing the mouse proglucagon promoter (1453 bp) was obtained by PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using the primers of GluP5SacI (5′-GTTGAGCTCTGCCAAGAGCTGTCCTT-3′) and Glup3NheI (5′-GTTGCTAGCCCTTCTGCACCAGGGTGCT-3′). The promoter harboring the mutant CRE/ATF site was obtained by two steps of PCR: (a) PCR was performed using two sets of primers, the GluP5SacI and GlumP3 (5′-GTGAATTTTGACCACAAATGAGCCTAGTCT-3′), GlumP5 (5′-GGCTCATTTGTGGTCAAAATTCACTTGAG-3′) and the Glup3NheI; (b) the template obtained by combining the diluted PCR products from the first step (a) was subjected to PCR again with the GluP5SacI and Glup3NheI primers. The products were then cloned into the SacI/NheI sites of pGL3 basic plasmid (Promega), and the mutant site was confirmed by sequencing. The reporter plasmid (1.0 μg) driven by the proglucagon promoter (normal or mutant) was transfected into αTC1.6 or NIH3T3 cells (3.5-cm well) with effector DNA, 0.5 μg of pcDNA3.1-ATF3, pcDNA3.1-ATF3b, and pCMV-SPORT6 CREB-327 (IMAGE clone; Invitrogen), using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). At 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated with media containing 20 μm forskolin/100 μm IBMX (Sigma). Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and luciferase activity was assayed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). For each transfection, 50 ng of Renilla luciferase reporter pRL-TK was included to normalize transfection efficiency. All transfection experiments were performed at least in duplicate. Cloning and Characterization of a Novel Isoform of ATF3b—In the course of cloning the coding sequence of ATF3 using a pair of primers described under “Materials and Methods,” we observed a band of 517 bp in addition to the expected 623-bp band representing ATF3 in both αTC1.6 cells as well as the islets of PC2 null mice (32Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouille Y. Holst J.J. Carroll R. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and littermate mice (Fig. 2A). Sequencing of the 517-bp cDNA (named ATF3b) reveals that it lacks 106 nucleotides beginning from position 25 of the ATF3 coding sequence. The deleted 106 nucleotides constitute an intron-like DNA fragment (33Padgett R.A. Grabowski P.J. Konarska M.M. Seiler S. Sharp P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1119-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is located in the corresponding exon 2 of the ATF3 gene (Fig. 1A). This deletion generates a novel stop codon at a site corresponding to aa residue position 10 of the ATF3 protein; the novel isoform, ATF3b, then initiates from a downstream in-frame ATG (Fig. 1B). The predicted ATF3b protein (124 aa) is an N-terminal-truncated form lacking the initial 57 aa of ATF3 but preserving the intact bZip domain (Fig. 1, B and C) that is absent in the ATF3ΔZip and ATF3ΔZip2 isoforms.Fig. 1Structure of ATF3 and alternatively spliced isoform, ATF3b.

Zhang C. Kawauchi J. Imoto I. Adachi M.T. Inazawa J. Amagasa T. Hai T. Kitajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2398-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), both ATF3 (upper band) and ATF3b (lower band) were detected in αTC1.6 cells, and both were down-regulated by glucose (Fig. 2B). These bands were also detected in whole pancreas homogenate (data not shown). Moreover, the ATF3b protein could be immunoprecipitated from products translated in vitro using an ATF3 C-terminal-specific antiserum (Fig. 2C); additionally, this protein contained the predicted leucine residue at position 5 as determined by N-terminal sequence analysis (Fig. 2D). These data thus confirm the expression of both ATF3b mRNA and protein in pancreatic α cells in concert with ATF3. The DNA Binding Properties of ATF3 and ATF3b Homo- and Heterodimers—To test whether these ATF3 proteins are involved in the transcriptional regulation of the proglucagon gene through its CRE/ATF site, we analyzed the binding ability of ATF3 or ATF3b homodimers to the normal and mutant ATF/CRE sites derived from mouse proglucagon promoter (Fig. 3). The EMSA results showed that both ATF3 and ATF3b protein bound to the normal ATF/CRE site (Fig. 3B , lanes 2 and 12) but not to the mutant sequence (lanes 7 and 17). The specificity was verified by supershifting of the DNA-protein complex (lanes 3 and 13) with an ATF3- and ATF3b-specific antiserum but not with a nonspecific antiserum (lanes 4 and 14). Moreover, the formation of the DNA-protein complex was inhibited by addition of an 80-fold excess of unlabeled competitor (lanes 5 and 15). On the other hand, disruption of specific binding by mutation of the CRE/ATF site (lanes 6–10 and 16–20) indicated that the homodimers of ATF3 or ATF3b protein bind directly to the CRE/ATF site of the proglucagon gene promoter and not to the flanking DNA regions. To compare the relative binding ability of ATF3 and ATF3b homodimers, we initially quantified the amount of ATF3 and ATF3b protein required for binding. Compared with ATF3, ∼10-fold less ATF3b protein was synthesized in vitro from the same amount of cDNA template based on normalized methionine radioactivity (ATF3/ATF3b = 10.3, p <0.0005, n = 3) (Fig. 4A). The low production of the ATF3b protein may reflect the presence of an atypical Kozak sequence for initiation of translation (34Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), because the transcriptional efficiency of the ATF3b plasmid is likely to be similar to that of the ATF3 plasmid in this system. However, comparative binding results based on 32P radioactivity of the respective bands indicated that the binding ability of the ATF3b homodimer is ∼15-fold higher than that of ATF3 homodimer normalized to the same protein amount (ATF3/ATF3b = 15.3, p <0.001, n = 3) (Fig. 4B). We also tested the binding ability of ATF3 and ATF3b heterodimers. As shown in Fig. 4C, such heterodimers can be formed and show a higher binding ability with the CRE/ATF site than the homodimers based on densitometric analysis (ATF3b heterodimer versus homodimer = 2.53, p <0.003, n = 3) (Fig. 4C). ATF3 and ATF3b Stimulate Proglucagon Transcription and This Action Is Potentiated by cAMP—To assess the role of ATF3 proteins in proglucagon gene transcription, transient transfection assays were performed in both αTC1.6 and NIH3T3 cells. The results indicated that the transcription of the proglucagon gene was stimulated by transfection of ATF3 or ATF3b along with the normal proglucagon gene promoter-luciferase construct (p <0.05, n = 4) in both αTC1.6 and NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5B). By contrast, the stimulatory activity was significantly reduced when these were transfected with a promoter construct containing a mutation in the CRE/ATF site (Fig. 5B , p <0.0005, n = 3). The results demonstrate that the stimulatory effect of the ATF3 proteins is dependent on the CRE/ATF site. Moreover, the stimulatory activity was dose-dependent on the amount of transfected DNA (data not shown), potentiated by elevated cAMP levels (Fig. 5B , p <0.05, n = 4), and paralleled the increased amounts of ATF3 and ATF3b protein (Fig. 5C). These observations suggest alterations in the levels of ATF3 proteins contribute to the regulation of proglucagon gene transcription. Note that the effects of ATF3 and ATF3b cotransfection lie between the effects of ATF3 or ATF3b transfection alone. This presumably reflects additivity in the binding ability of heterodimers with the CRE/ATF site. In these experiments, the basal activity of the proglucagon promoter was lower in NIH3T3 versus αTC1cells, which may reflect the lack of some important transcription factors for basal proglucagon gene transcription in these non-glucagon-producing NIH3T3 cells. It should be noted also that, in agreement with the transfection results described above, the increased proglucagon mRNA level in αTC1.6 cells paralleled the increased level of ATF3 proteins in α TC1.6 cells treated with forskolin/IBMX (Fig. 5D). ATF3 Proteins Have Effects Similar to Those of CREB Protein on Proglucagon Gene Transcription in Pancreatic α Cells— The effects of ATF3 proteins on proglucagon gene transcription were compared with those of CREB-327, a cAMP signal effector (4Knepel W. Chafitz J. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6799-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Miller C.P. Lin J.C. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7080-7090Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, in non-glucagon-producing NIH3T3 cells (lower panel), CREB-327 showed a greater stimulation of proglucagon gene transcription as compared with the ATF3 proteins. However, in αTC1.6 cells (upper panel), the effects of ATF3 proteins were similar under normal culture conditions (columns 2 or 3 or 4 versus 5, p >0.05, n = 3) and were potentiated more than that of CREB-327 in response to forskolin/IBMX (columns 11 or 12 versus 13, p <0.01, n = 3), although ATF3 alone exhibited the highest activity among the three proteins (column 11). Compared with that in NIH3T3 cells (lower panel, column 13 versus 5 = 4.54, p <0.01, n = 3), the attenuated effect of CREB-327 in response to the cAMP signal in αTC1.6 cells (upper panel, column 13 versus 5 = 2.69, p <0.05, n = 3) may reflect the fact that pancreatic α cells express at high levels a large number of transcription factors, including the bZip proteins,2 some of which may associate with and attenuate the activity of CREB-327 as described previously (9Miller C.P. Lin J.C. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7080-7090Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Another possibility may be related to the high basal cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity and its reduced responsiveness to added exogenous cAMP in the original αTC1 cells from which the αTC1.6 cells were cloned (35Arava Y. Adamsky K. Belleli A. Shaltiel S. Walker M.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Without forskolin/IBMX, no significant synergistic effects of CREB and ATF3 proteins were observed in either cell type (Fig. 6, column 5 versus 6 or 7 or 8, p >0.05, n = 3). This result is in agreement with the absence of CREB/ATF3 heterodimer formation found by others (36van Dam H. Castellazzi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2453-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and ourselves. With forskolin/IBMX, some combination of CREB/ATF3 proteins (upper panel, column 14 versus 13, p <0.05, n = 3; lower panel, column 15 versus 13, p <0.05, n = 3) showed enhanced effects compared with that of each alone. This result may reflect partial overlapped positive effects of ATF3 and CREB proteins in response to cAMP signal. It should be noted that although the double banding pattern of ATF3b expression seen in Fig. 5C suggests phosphorylation, this could not be demonstrated (data not shown). Therefore, it is more likely that the lower band arises from initiation at an internal ATG codon (see Fig. 1). The identification of the novel isoform ATF3b indicates that alternative splicing of the ATF3 gene generates more functionally diversified products in addition to ATF3ΔZip and ATF3ΔZip2. The ATF3b protein, which lacks a weak activation region (1–39 aa) and 18 aa of the repression region (40–84 aa) (37Hsu J.C. Bravo R. Taub R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 4654-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), retains the intact bZip domain for DNA binding. Compared with ATF3, its expression is lower in islets and αTC1.6 cells (Fig. 2B). The reason may likely be due to both the atypical Kozak sequence and low level of ATF3b mRNA (Fig. 2B). Intriguingly, the binding ability of the ATF3b homodimer with the CRE/ATF site of the proglucagon promoter was much higher than that of ATF3 homodimers (Fig. 4B). This property may remedy its low expression level in contributing to the regulation of proglucagon gene transcription. In addition, the ATF3b homodimer and heterodimer with ATF3 showed a much higher binding ability in vitro than the ATF3 homodimer (Fig. 4, B and C) but somewhat weaker effect on proglucagon gene expression in cellular systems compared with that by ATF3 (Fig. 5B). These observations suggest that the 1–57 aa region of ATF3 contains regions that strongly interfere with binding and only weakly activate transcription. The results of EMSA (Figs. 3 and 4C) and transient transfection assays (Fig. 5) clearly indicate that the homo- and heterodimers of ATF3 and ATF3b directly bind to the specific CRE/ATF element and stimulate proglucagon gene expression. This role of the ATF3 proteins is indirectly supported by the observations of higher plasma glucagon concentrations in ATF3 transgenic mice (25Allen-Jennings A.E. Hartman M.G. Kociba G.J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20020-20025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and the elevated levels of proglucagon mRNA in the islets of PC2 null mice (1Webb G.C. Akbar M.S. Zhao C. Swift H.H. Steiner D.F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that is also accompanied by a significant increase of ATF3 protein (data not shown). In the pancreatic α cell, despite the fact that the CREB and ATF3 proteins specifically act on the same CRE/ATF motif of the proglucagon promoter, their effects may be exerted in different physiological states. Thus, the CREB protein can be rapidly phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and may be adapted to meet the increased need for elevated glucagon production and/or secretion in stressful situations, such as hypoglycemia and sudden muscular activity, through activation of adenylate cyclase. However, the ATF3 proteins do not have consensus phosphorylation sites for PKA (15Drysdale B.E. Howard D.L. Johnson R.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, the ATF3 proteins may provide a more prolonged glucagon response by acting through increasing amounts of active protein. Because the levels of the ATF3 proteins can be up-regulated both by decreasing glucose concentration and elevated cAMP, regulation of proglucagon gene expression by ATF3 proteins may cover a broader spectrum of physiological demands, including fasting and hypoglycemia, in addition to stress responses. The increased proglucagon mRNA level seen in islets cultured for 6 h at reduced levels of glucose from 5 to 2 mm (11Dumonteil E. Magnan C. Ritz-Laser B. Ktorza A. Meda P. Philippe J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and in the pancreas of 4-day fasting rats (12Chen L. Komiya I. Inman L. O'Neil J. Appel M. Alam T. Unger R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) may be partially because of positive contributions of increased ATF3 proteins to the expression of the proglucagon gene. Overall, we have demonstrated the existence of a novel mechanism for regulation of the transcription of the proglucagon gene by glucose and cAMP signals in addition to the CREB protein in pancreatic α cells. Although high ATF3 levels are present in α cells, whether this mechanism is dominant compared with the role of CREB or how specific it might be for α cells as compared with two other cell types, such as the enteroendocrine L cells and some neuronal cells, will require additional studies. Because a similar CRE/ATF element is located in the human proglucagon gene promoter (38Nian M. Drucker D.J. Irwin D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G829-G837PubMed Google Scholar), a role for ATF3 proteins in human proglucagon gene expression seems plausible. Intriguingly, regulation of proglucagon gene expression by the Wnt signaling pathway has recently been demonstrated in enteroendocrine L cells. However, regulation of proglucagon gene expression by lithium via this pathway has not been shown in pancreatic α cells (27Ni Z. Anini Y. Fang X. Mills G. Brubaker P.L. Jin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1380-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In summary, in the present study we have characterized the specific binding ability of ATF3 and ATF3b with the CRE/ATF motif of the proglucagon gene and demonstrated a novel mechanism in addition to CREB by which the transcription of this gene may be regulated in response to cAMP signals and to glucose fluctuations in pancreatic α cells. Because pancreatic α cells play an important physiological role in responding to low glucose levels, a stressful condition for many cell types, the α cells appear to be equipped with a multifaceted mechanism to support this feature. The higher levels of bZip proteins, including ATF3 and ATF3b, in α cells may be a part of this mechanism. Further dissection of the interactions of ATF3 proteins with some of the other bZip protein family members may extend our understanding of this aspect of proglucagon gene expression.

This effect of GPA could occur in two ways, enhancement of band 3 anion transport function or enhancement of band 3 trafficking to the cell surface. We have examined the GPA effect using GPA mutants. We compared the sequences of GPA and its homolog glycophorin B (GPB; which does not facilitate band 3 cell-surface activity or trafficking) to identify candidate regions of GPA for study. We constructed several GPA or GPB mutants, including naturally occurring GPA/GPB hybrid molecules and insertion, deletion, and substitution mutants. We analyzed the effects of the mutant proteins on band 3-specific chloride transport and surface presentation using co-expression in Xenopus oocytes. We find that the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of GPA enhances trafficking of band 3 to the cell surface, whereas the extracellular residues 68–70 increase the specific anion transport activity of band 3. In addition, examination of the oligomerization of GPA mutants showed that single amino acid substitutions N-terminal to the transmembrane domain greatly reduce SDS-stable GPA dimer formation, implying that regions outside the transmembrane domain of GPA are important for GPA dimer formation.

Glycophorin A (GPA) 1The abbreviations used are: GPA, human erythrocyte glycophorin A; GPB, human erythrocyte glycophorin B; TM, transmembrane span. is a bitopic integral membrane sialoglycoprotein that is present in the red cell in similar abundance to band 3 (for review, see Refs. 7Cartron J.P.

Vox Sang. 1990; 58: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and there is substantial evidence for interactions between GPA and band 3 in the red cell membrane.

Anti-Wrb antibodies require the presence of both GPA and band 3 for their reactivity with red cells and co-immunoprecipitate both GPA and band 3 (10Telen M.J. Chasis J.A. Blood. 1990; 76: 842-848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GPA facilitates the movement of band 3 to the cell surface in Xenopus oocytes. Co-expression of cRNAs corresponding to wild-type band 3 and GPA induces an increased level of band 3-mediated chloride influx in the oocytes by facilitating the trafficking of band 3 to the oocyte surface and potentially also by enhancing the anion transport function of band 3 (14Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 140: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The enhancing effect of GPA on band 3 transport activity at the oocyte surface is independent of the oligomeric state of GPA; GPA mutants that are unable to form stable dimers act upon band 3 in the same fashion as wild-type GPA (16Young M.T. Beckmann R. Toye A.M. Tanner M.J.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Other evidence also suggests an interaction between band 3 and GPA at an early stage in the biosynthesis and intracellular processing of the two proteins (1Tanner M.J.A. Mol. Memb.

The N-glycan chain of band 3 is increased in size in red cells that lack GPA (18Gahmberg C.G. Myllyla G. Leikola J. Pirkola A. Nordling S. J. Biol.

Blood. 1994; 84: 916-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but is decreased in size in red cells that effectively have more GPA than normal (21Dahr W. Moulds J. Unger P. Kordowicz M. Blut. 1987; 55: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The sulfate transport activity of band 3 is diminished in GPA-deficient human red cells, although the amount of band 3 remains unchanged (20Bruce L.J. Groves J.D. Okubo Y. Thilaganathan B. Tanner M.J.A. Blood. 1994; 84: 916-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The red cells of band 3 gene knock-out mice do not express either band 3 or GPA, although the erythroid precursors contain GPA mRNA, indicating that band 3 is also involved in the movement of GPA to the cell surface (22Hassoun H. Hanada T. Lutchman M. Sahr K.E. Palek J. Hanspal M. Chishti A.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 2146-2151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these interactions between GPA and band 3, there is no evidence that the closely related red cell glycophorin B (GPB) interacts directly with band 3. Co-expression of GPB with band 3 in Xenopus oocytes has no effect on band 3 anion transport activity (14Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GPA forms SDS-stable dimers by self-association of the transmembrane (TM) region (residues 73–95).

Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.H. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Although the NMR structure of the GPA dimer showed the transmembrane region clearly, the structure of residues 62–71 (N-terminal to the transmembrane domain) was poorly defined. In the present study we have examined the role of different regions of the GPA molecule in its interaction with band 3 by performing an extensive mutational analysis of the GPA molecule. Detailed examination of the sequences of GPA and GPB, a molecule with a close sequence relationship to GPA that does not enhance band 3-mediated chloride transport (14Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), allowed identification of target regions for mutagenesis. We examined the effects of the GPA mutations on both band 3 function in Xenopus oocytes and GPA dimerization. We find that the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of GPA is responsible for enhancing trafficking of band 3 to the cell surface, whereas the extracellular residues 68–70 of GPA (N-terminal to the transmembrane domain) have a role in increasing the specific activity of band 3 for anion transport. Our data demonstrate that the presence of GPA results in the enhancement of band 3 anion transport function as well as band 3 trafficking to the cell surface. In addition, we find that single amino acid substitutions N-terminal to the transmembrane domain of GPA greatly reduce SDS-stable GPA dimer formation, implying that regions outside the transmembrane domain of GPA are important for GPA dimer formation. Construction of GPA Mutants—The constructs pBSXG1.B3, pBSXG. GPA, and pBSXG.GPB have been described previously (14Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They contain the cDNAs encoding human intact red cell band 3, GPA, and GPB, respectively, flanked by the 5′- and 3′-non-coding regions of Xenopus β-globin. The three GPA/GPB hybrid molecules MiV (GPA-(1–58)-GPB (27–72)), Sta (GPB-(1–26)-GPA-(59–131)), and Dantu (GPB-(1–39)-GPA-(72–131)) were prepared as follows. The respective regions of GPA and GPB present in each hybrid were amplified by PCR using a 5′ or 3′ BSXG-specific primer and a hybrid-specific primer to give two fragments with an overlap of 20 bases at the hybrid crossover position. The two fragments were mixed and allowed to anneal and extend in 10 cycles of PCR without primers (95 °C for 30s, 60 °C for 40s, 72 °C for 1 min). 5′ and 3′ BSXG-specific primers were added, and 30 cycles of PCR (95 °C for 30s, 52 °C for 40s, 72 °C for 1 min) were performed. The resulting PCR products were digested with BstXI and BstEII and ligated into BstXI- and BstEII-digested pBSXG vector. The double substitution mutant GPA F78L/G79C was prepared in the same manner as the GPA/GPB hybrids except that both fragments were amplified from pBSXG.GPA before annealing. A six-amino acid insertion in GPA (insertion of VPAPVV between Glu-72 and Ile-73; BintoA) was constructed by amplification of the entire pBSXG.GPA plasmid using primers to generate a linear fragment with the inserted bases and NarI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends. The PCR product was restricted using NarI and ligated to generate the insertion mutant. Two C-terminal deletion mutants of GPA were also used. GPA-(1–97) has been described previously (CtDelA (14Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). GPA-(1–101) was constructed by PCR amplification of the GPA-coding region with a 3′ primer-containing sequence annealing to the region of GPA from Arg-97 to Lys-101 including a stop codon and a BstEII site. The PCR product was restricted with BstXI and BstEII and ligated into BstXI- and BstEII-digested pBSXG vector. The GPA mutants H66Q, H67Q, F68C, S69C, E70C, P71C, E72C, and R97M were prepared using the Seamless Cloning kit (Stratagene) (31Padgett K.A. Sorge J.A. (Amst.). 1996; 168: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Padgett K.A. Sorge J.A. Strategies. 1996; 9: 14-16Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The Seamless Cloning kit was also used to generate the deletion constructs GPAΔPhe-68–Glu-70, GPAΔAla-65–Glu-70, GPAΔArg-61–Glu-70, and GPBΔPro-41–Val-43. In Vitro Transcription, Cell-free Translation, and Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Transcription of cRNA in vitro was performed with the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). The methods used for cell-free translation in the rabbit reticulocyte system with canine pancreatic microsomes, purification of microsomes, isolation of Xenopus oocytes, injection with cRNA, Cl– transport assay, and chymotrypsin treatment of oocytes have been described previously (14Groves J.D.

Where possible chloride transport studies were carried out in parallel on the same batch of oocytes as those used for the cell surface expression assays using chymotrypsin, but different amounts of the cRNAs were injected for the transport and chymotrypsin assays as indicated in the legends to Figs. 2 and 3. For the oocyte chymotrypsin assay, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207530) Google Scholar) and subjected to Western blotting using the ECL method as described in the figure legends. The chymotrypsin assays were done in parallel on matched groups of oocytes from the same batch (injected with band 3 cRNA alone, band 3 plus normal GPA cRNAs, band 3 plus GPA mutant cRNAs and uninjected oocytes). The quantitative data shown in Table I were obtained by scanning films exposed so that the band density was within the linear range of the film.Fig. 3Western blotting of band 3 from chymotrypsin-treated oocytes. Oocytes were co-injected with 5 ng of cRNA/oocyte full-length band 3 with 1.5 ng of cRNA/oocyte of GPA, GPB, or glycophorin mutant and allowed to express protein for 48 h at 18 °C. Groups of 30 oocytes were treated with chymotrypsin for 1 h at 4 °C as described previously (14Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Groups of 10 oocytes were homogenized with 30 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) SDS) and centrifuged twice at 13000 rpm for 5 min to remove cell debris and yolk granules. The homogenate was separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels according to the method of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207530) Google Scholar). Band 3 and band 3 fragments were visualized by Western blotting using the monoclonal antibody BRIC 155 (against the C terminus of band 3 (B3)). Each lane represents approximately half the protein from 10 oocytes. The proportion of band 3 that was cleaved by chymotrypsin at the surface of the oocytes to yield the 35-kDa C-terminal portion detected by BRIC 155 was determined using scanning densitometry and is shown in Table I (% at surface). Each lane is labeled at the top with the name of the constructs that it represents (band 3 = B3), and the whole protein bands and 35-kDa fragment are indicated. Most lanes also show a third band, which runs at ∼55 kDa. This band is assumed to be the membrane domain of band 3. It is likely that there is some internal cleavage of band 3 between the membrane and cytoplasmic domains during expression in the oocyte. Composite gels are indicated with a thick black line between the composites. Panel A, blots of oocytes co-injected with band 3 (B3) and GPA, GPA/GPB and GPB/GPA hybrids, F78L/G79C (FGLC), and BintoA.

Open table in a new tab Analysis of GPA and GPB Sequences for Regions Involved in Band 3 Interactions— Fig. 1A shows a “bubble diagram” representation of the human GPA molecule in the membrane, with the C terminus at the cytosolic face. Fig. 1B shows a sequence alignment of GPA and GPB, its close homolog. Because GPB does not enhance band 3-mediated anion transport in oocytes (14Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this alignment was used to examine regions of sequence difference that could be important for the action of GPA on band 3. Analysis of the two sequences indicates four main differences. First, GPA has a 32-amino acid insertion within its extracellular N terminus (amino acids 27–58). Second, there is considerable sequence difference in the extracellular region N-terminal to the transmembrane domain (Arg-61–Glu-72 in GPA; Thr-29–Val-43 in GPB). GPB has a 3-amino acid insertion (Pro-41–Val-43) N-terminal to the transmembrane domain. Third, there are three sequence differences within the transmembrane spans of GPA and GPB (F78L, G79C, and V84I from GPA to GPB). Fourth, GPA has an additional 30-amino acid C terminus (amino acids 102–131). Many naturally occurring hybrids of GPA and GPB in human red cells have been reported (36Reid M.E. Lomas-Francis C. The Blood Group Antigen Facts Book. Academic Press, Inc, San Diego, CA1997Google Scholar), and some of these molecules were also used in analysis of regions of interest on the GPA molecule. MiV (GPA-(1–58)-GPB-(27–72)), Sta (GPB-(1–26)-GPA-(59–131)), and Dantu (GPB-(1–39)-GPA-(72–131)) hybrids were constructed. Several other GPA mutants were also constructed (Fig. 1C) for this study. A double substitution mutant where two residues within the GPA transmembrane span were changed to their corresponding residues in GPA (GPA F78L/G79C) was prepared. Six amino acids from the portion of GPB N-terminal to its transmembrane domain (Val-38–Val-43) were inserted into the same position in GPA (BintoA). The 3-amino acid region Pro-41–Val-43 was deleted from GPB (GPBΔPro-41–Val-43). Two GPA C-terminal deletions (GPA-(1–97) and GPA-(1–101)), a truncation series where 3, 6, and 10 amino acids were deleted from the region of GPA N terminus to the transmembrane span (GPAΔPhe-68–Glu-70, GPAΔAla-65–Glu-70, and GPAΔArg-61–Glu-70) and several single amino acid substitutions of GPA were constructed. Effect of GPA and GPB Mutants on Band 3-specific Anion Transport and Band 3 Surface Presentation in Xenopus Oocytes—In vitro transcribed mRNA was co-injected into Xenopus oocytes with mRNA for human erythrocyte band 3 and either wild-type GPA, wild-type GPB, GPA mutant, or GPB mutant mRNA, and the band 3-specific anion transport was estimated from the 4,4′-dinitrostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DNDS)-sensitive chloride uptake induced in the oocytes (Fig. 2). Chloride transport of all the mutants was measured in individual oocytes using a total of ∼15 oocytes per experimental sample and in duplicate sets of experiments using different batches of oocytes. In each experiment control samples comprising oocytes injected with band 3 mRNA alone and oocytes co-injected with both band 3 and wild-type GPA mRNAs were analyzed to allow normalization of data sets. The graphs in Fig. 2 show the percentage enhancement of band 3-mediated chloride transport induced in the oocytes by co-injection of band 3 and the GPA mutant mRNAs (over basal band 3 chloride transport activity induced in the oocytes by band 3 mRNA alone) with transport due to band 3 mRNA alone set at 0% and transport due to band 3 mRNA co-injected with wild-type GPA mRNA set at 100%. Data from the transport assays are shown in Table I. Because GPA is known to increase the amount of band 3 at the oocyte surface, we also measured the proportion of band 3 protein that moved to the oocyte surface using a protease accessibility assay (33Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Band 3 has a single extracellular site susceptible to extracellular chymotrypsin cleavage, which is located between transmembrane spans 5 and 6. Intact oocytes expressing band 3 and glycophorin mutants were treated with chymotrypsin, and the 35-kDa C-terminal band 3 fragment generated by extracellular cleavage of band 3 at the oocyte surface was separated from the uncleaved band 3 located within the cells using SDS-PAGE. Previous studies of the time course of chymotrypsin cleavage show that extracellular band 3 cleavage is complete under the conditions used in these experiments whether GPA is present or absent (14Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody was used to detect and estimate the relative proportions of the 35-kDa fragment (derived from surface band 3) and intact band 3 (internal band 3) in the oocytes (Fig. 3). Films exposed so that the band density was in the linear range of the film were scanned, and the quantitative data are shown in Table I (the images shown in Fig. 3 are from film exposed for optimum reproduction rather than linearity of band density). The percentage increase of surface band 3 protein induced by each mutant GPA relative to that induced by wild-type GPA was calculated and is shown in Table I. The values shown in Table I represent the increase in band 3 protein expressed at the cell surface after subtraction of basal band 3 surface expression (when no GPA is present). Each lane from the blots in Fig. 3 represents approximately half the protein from 10 oocytes of the same batch, and where possible the protease accessibility assays for band 3 co-expressed with each glycophorin mutant were repeated at least once on a different batch of oocytes to allow for batch variability. It should be noted that although each transport experiment and the corresponding protease accessibility assays were carried out in parallel on the same batches of oocytes, 10-fold higher concentrations of cRNAs and a longer expression time in the oocytes were employed for the protease accessibility assays compared with the transport assays to enable the expressed band 3 to be reliably detected by immunoblotting. As previously reported (14Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 140: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), under the conditions used for the chloride uptake transport assay it is necessary to inject small amounts of band 3 cRNA. This ensures that the basal level of chloride uptake resulting from the expression of band 3 alone is low enough to maximize the enhancement in chloride uptake resulting from co-expression of GPA that is observed in the assay. However, because of the different cRNA levels and expression times employed for the transport and protease accessibility assays, there is a qualitative rather than a precise quantitative correlation of the effects of GPA and the GPA mutants in the two assays. Co-expression with GPA increased the amount of band 3 protein at the cell surface (38% compared with 9% for band 3 alone; Fig. 3A and Table I legend) as has been described previously (14Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 140: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Co-expression of band 3 with GPB had little effect on either the band 3-specific anion transport or the surface presentation of band 3 protein, as has been previously reported (14Groves J.D. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GPA/GPB hybrid MiV had a slightly inhibitory effect on band 3-specific anion transport and no effect on band 3 surface expression, but both the GPB/GPA hybrids (Dantu and Sta) enhanced both band 3-specific anion transport and the surface presentation of band 3 protein in a parallel fashion (Figs. 2A and 3A; Table I). The Dantu hybrid appeared to be particularly effective in enhancing band 3 surface movement, whereas the Sta hybrid was slightly less effective than normal GPA. The GPB deletion mutant GPBΔPro-41–Val-43 behaved in the same fashion as GPB (Figs. 2A and 3B; Table I). Double substitution of Phe-78 and Gly-79 in the GPA transmembrane span (F78L/G79C) did not alter the effect of GPA on band 3 (Fig. 2B and 3A; Table I). Both insertion of six residues N-terminal to the GPA transmembrane span (BintoA) and deletion of 3, 6, or 10 residues within the region of GPA N-terminal to the transmembrane domain (GPAΔPhe-68–Glu-70, GPAΔAla-65–Glu-70, and GPAΔArg-61–Glu-70) gave rise to constructs produced either no enhancement or little enhancement of band 3-specific chloride transport in the oocytes (–3, 20, 18 and 19%, respectively Fig. 2, Table I). However, these constructs retained the ability to enhance the cell surface trafficking of band 3 protein at least as efficiently as wild-type GPA (Fig. 3, A and B, Table I). Althoug"
https://openalex.org/W2084339377,"Our goal was to define the role of phosphorylated cardiac troponin-I in the adult myocyte contractile performance response to activated protein kinase C. In agreement with earlier work, endothelin enhanced both adult rat myocyte contractile performance and cardiac troponin-I phosphorylation. Protein kinase C participated in both responses.

In functional studies, endothelin slowed relaxation in myocytes expressing slow skeletal troponin-I, while the relaxation rate increased in myocytes expressing cardiac troponin-I. Based on these results, acceleration of myocyte relaxation during protein kinase C activation largely depended on cardiac troponin-I phosphorylation. Experiments with troponin-I isoform chimeras provided evidence that phosphorylation sites in the amino portion of cardiac troponin I-mediated the protein kinase C acceleration of relaxation. The cardiac troponin-I Thr-144 phosphorylation site identified in earlier biochemical studies was not significantly phosphorylated during the acute contractile response.

Different isoforms of TnI influence myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (1Westfall M.V. Rust E.M. Metzger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and contribute to developmental changes in myofilament function. In particular, the transition from slow skeletal TnI (ssTnI) expression in embryonic/fetal hearts to the cardiac isoform expressed exclusively in adult hearts appears to “fine tune” myofilament regulatory function (1Westfall M.V. Rust E.M. Metzger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 2Saggin L. Gorza L. Ausoni S. Schiaffino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16299-16302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+ sensitivity properties of the myofilaments also can be modified by TnI phosphorylation (3Westfall M.V. Turner I.I. Albayya F. Metzger J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C324-C332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, β-adrenergic activation of protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates cardiac TnI (cTnI), which reduces myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (3Westfall M.V. Turner I.I. Albayya F. Metzger J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C324-C332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and contributes to accelerated relaxation in intact adult myocardium (4Fentzke R.C. Buck S.H. Patel J.R. Lin H. Wolska B.M.

TnI also is phosphorylated by activated protein kinase C (PKC) (5Noland Jr., T.A. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4974-4978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X.

Darvish A. Murphy L. Sweet W. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the specific role of TnI in the contractile response remains unclear. The activation and expression pattern of multiple PKC isoforms in the heart changes under pathophysiological conditions, which may influence the role of PKC-mediated TnI phosphorylation in the contractile function response. In adult myocardium, the classical α isoform, as well as the novel δ and ϵ isoforms are normally expressed in both rats and humans (8Erdbrugger W. Keffel J. Knocks M. Otto T. Phillipp T. Michel M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16938-16944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while expression of the classical β isoform is absent from adult myocytes from these species (8Erdbrugger W. Keffel J. Knocks M. Otto T. Phillipp T. Michel M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Rybin V.O. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, pathophysiological conditions, such as pressure overload-induced hypertrophy and diabetic hypertrophy are associated with increased α and δ expression in rat models (12Braun M.U. LaRosee P. Schon S. Borst M.M. Strasser R.H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 56: 52-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Giles T.D. Ouyang J. Kerut E.K. Given M.B. Allen G.E. McIlwain E.F. Greenberg S.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H295-H307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased levels and activity of PKC α, βI, and βII are observed in heart failure patients (14Bowling N. Walsh R. Song G. Estridge T. Sandusky G. Fouts R. Mintze K. Pickard T. Roden R. Bristow M. Sabbah H. Mazrahi J. Gromo G. King G. Vlahos C. Circulation. 1999; 99: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Moreover, the contractile response to PKC activation also is altered in myocytes from heart failure patients (15Hajjar R.J. Grossman W. Gwathmey J.K. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1992; 87: 143-159PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation state of cTnI also changes under situations associated with cardiac pathophysiology. Troponin I phosphorylation significantly decreases during heart failure (16Zakhary D.R. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Bartel S.

Allen P.D. Crimmins D.L. Ladenson J.H. Anderson P.A.W. Circulation. 1997; 96: 1495-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and a component of this decrease is attributed to alterations in cTnI phosphorylation by PKC (17Bartel S. Stein B. Eschenhagen T. Ulrike M. Neumann J. Schmitz W. Krause E.-G. Karczewski P. Scholz H. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1996; 157: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Bodor G.S. Oakeley A.E. Allen P.D. Crimmins D.L. Ladenson J.H. Anderson P.A.W. Circulation. 1997; 96: 1495-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice, levels of TnI phosphorylation increase with up-regulation of at least one PKC isoform, prior to the development of cardiac dysfunction (19Takeishi Y. Chu G. Kirkpatrick D. Li Z. Wakasaki H. Kranias E. King G. Walsh RA J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Collectively, TnI phosphorylation and studies of PKC expression/activation provide evidence that the relationship between PKC activation, cTnI phosphorylation, and contractile function may change during pathophysiological conditions associated with cardiac dysfunction. Thus, it is important to first establish the function of phosphorylated cTnI in the acute physiological contractile function response to PKC. The goal of the present study is to define the physiological role of cTnI in the adult cardiac myocyte contractile response to endothelin (ET). ET is a potent endogenous mediator of contractile function in the heart (20Cingolani H. Alvarez B. Ennis I. de Hurtado C. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 780Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21Thomas P.B.

Physiol. 1995; 268: H1621-H1627PubMed Google Scholar), and the short term contractile response to ET is largely mediated via activation of PKC (23Jiang T. Pak E. Zhang H. Kline R. Steinberg S. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 724-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Kramer B.K. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The cTnI phosphorylation sites of interest are Ser-23/24, Ser-43/45, and Thr-144, because these sites are phosphorylated by PKC incubation with purified cTnI (6Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M. Averyhart-Fullard V. Solaro R.J. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25445-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our strategy in the present study focuses on parallel temporal measurements of adult cardiac myocyte myofilament phosphorylation and sarcomere length in response to a range of ET doses. Results from myocytes expressing endogenous cTnI are compared with myocytes expressing ssTnI, cTnI/ssTnI chimeras, and TnI mutants after viral-mediated gene transfer. In earlier studies, this gene transfer approach produced stoichiometric replacement of endogenous cTnI in the sarcomere (1Westfall M.V. Rust E.M. Metzger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Westfall M.V. Albayya F.P. Turner I.I. Metzger J.M. Circ.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22508-22516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The rationale for using the selected isoform, chimeras, and mutants is that each of these TnI proteins lacks one or more of the 3 PKC-mediated phosphorylation sites. The ssTnI isoform lacks the Ser-23/24 and Thr-144 sites, but contains a consensus sequence for PKC at the residues analogous to cTnI Ser-43/45 (ssTnIThr-11/Ser-13) (27Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Hunter Y. Sefton B.M. Protein Kinase Phosphorylation Site Sequences and Consensus Specificity Motifs: Tabulations. Academic Press, San Diego1991: 62-81Google Scholar, 28Hastings K.E. Koppe R.I. Marmor E. Bader D. Shimada Y. Toyota N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19659-19665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chimera N-card/slow-C TnI (25Westfall M.V. Albayya F.P. Turner I.I. Metzger J.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) contains the Ser-23/24 and Ser-43/45 sites, while Thr144 and the amino-terminal Thr/Ser of ssTnI are present in the N-slow/card-C TnI sequence (26Westfall M.V. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22508-22516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The cTnI Thr-144 site is of particular interest because it lies within the inhibitory peptide (IP) region of TnI. The IP region is believed to act as a molecular switch as it toggles from actin to troponin C in response to Ca2+ (29Syska H. Wilkinson J.M. Grand R.J. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and the ability of this region to be modified by phosphorylation would indicate an important potential target for therapeutic regimens designed to modify myofilament function. Thus, we compared the ability of Thr-144 to be phosphorylated in intact myocytes treated with ET to the two sets of phosphorylation sites located in the amino portion of cTnI. In these experiments, the Pro-112 present in the analogous position of the ssTnI sequence is substituted for Thr-144 in cTnI, and vice versa. Individual gene transfer and expression of cTnI T144P and ssTnI P112T in adult myocytes is followed by a comparison of ET-induced phosphorylation of these mutant proteins versus wild-type cTnI in the intact adult myocyte. Taken together, studies described here provide important insight into the role of cTnI in the acute ET-induced, PKC-activated enhancement of contractile performance, and the relative significance of cTnI phosphorylation sites in the intact myocyte. Generation of Adenoviral Vectors—Recombinant adenoviral vectors were constructed by co-transfection of shuttle plasmids containing TnI cDNAs (cTnI, ssTnI, N-slow/card-CTnI, ssTnIP112T, cTnIT144P, and cTnIT144PFLAG) and pJM17 into HEK293 cells (1Westfall M.V. Rust E.M. Metzger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Virus replication was carried out in the HEK293 cell line, which expresses the E1 region of the adenoviral genome in trans. Recombinant adenoviral DNA was identified by Southern blot analysis (1Westfall M.V. Rust E.M. Metzger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis Strategy—Full-length wild-type ssTnI and cTnI cDNAs were kind gifts of Ann Murphy (30Murphy A.M. Jones L. Sims H.F. Strauss A.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition to preparing recombinant adenovirus from each of these constructs, the cDNAs were used to separately generate N-slow/card-C TnI and N-card/slow-C TnI in pGEM-3Z, as described earlier (25Westfall M.V. Albayya F.P. Turner I.I. Metzger J.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Westfall M.V. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22508-22516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The TnI constructs, cTnIFLAG, cTnIT144P, cTnIT144PFLAG, and ssTnIP112T, were prepared using the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit. Preparation of cTnIFLAG was performed as described earlier (31Michele D.E. Albayya F.P. Metzger J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotide primers were used to make cTnIT144P (primer 1: GCAAGTTTAAGCGGCCGCCTCTCCGAAGAGTG; primer 2: CACTCTTCGGAGAGGCGGCCGCTTAAACTTGC; underlined regions indicate mutated residues), and ssTnIP112T (primer 1: GGGAAGTTCAAGCGGCCGACTCTGCGCCGGGTC; primer 2: GGACCCGGCGCAGAGTCGGCCGCTTGAACTTCCC). Each cDNA was then subcloned into the pCA4 shuttle vector. Chimeric and mutant protein production were verified in HEK293 cells prior to making virus. Primary Cultures of Adult Cardiac Myocytes—Ventricular myocytes were isolated from adult rats, as described previously (32Westfall M.V. Rust E.M. Albayya F. Metzger J.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1997; 52: 307-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of Ca2+-tolerant myocytes (2 × 104) were plated on laminin-coated coverslips and incubated at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (P/S). After 2 h, media was replaced with adenovirus diluted in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + P/S. Serum-free media (2 ml) was added after an hour incubation with adenovirus, and media was changed the day after adding virus and then every 2–3 days. Western Blot Analysis of Protein Composition—Control and adenovirus-treated adult rat cardiac myocytes maintained in culture for 4 days were scraped from coverslips into 10 μl of sample buffer (1Westfall M.V. Rust E.M. Metzger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Samples were separated by gel electrophoresis and transblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 2000 V-h with immunodetection carried out as described by Westfall et al. (33Westfall M.V. Samuelson L.C. Metzger J.M. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 24-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using a 1:1000 dilution of anti-TnI monoclonal antibody (mAb; Fitzgerald), a monoclonal antibody which recognizes all isoforms of TnI. In separate experiments, blots from adult cardiac myocytes collected 1–7 days after gene transfer were probed for the major endogenous protein kinase C isoforms observed in rat hearts using anti-PKCα (1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PKCβ (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PKCδ (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-PKCϵ (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) Abs, followed by secondary goat anti-rabbit Ab (α, β) or donkey anti-rabbit Ab (δ,ϵ) both of which are conjugated to peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences; 1:2000; Sigma 1:1000, respectively). Phosphorylation of Myofilament Proteins in Intact Cardiac Myocytes—Myocytes cultured for 4–5 days were incubated with [32P] orthophosphate (100 μCi) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + P/S at 37 °C. After a 2-h labeling interval, radioactive media was replaced with unlabeled media containing calyculin A (10 nm) alone or in addition to endothelin-1 (ET, 10–250 nm), a PKC inhibitor (e.g. chelerythrine, 10 μm; bisindolylmaleimide, 500 nm to 1 μm), or ET plus a PKC inhibitor, and incubated for 5–40 min at 37 °C. Experiments with calyculin A + ET added along with the inactive bisindolylmaleimide structural analog that lacks PKC-inhibiting properties, bisindolylmaleimide V (Bis-V; 1 μm), the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm), the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (2 μm), the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (0.5 μm), or the PKA inhibitor, H-89 (0.1 μm) also were carried out at 37 °C for 10 min. Phosphorylation was terminated by replacing media with ice-cold relaxing solution (RS; 7 mm EGTA, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 1 mm free Mg2+, 14.5 mm creatine phosphate, and 4 mm MgATP with sufficient KCl to yield an ionic strength of 180 mm, pH 7.00). Myocytes were then permeabilized in ice-cold RS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 followed by several rinses in RS alone. Cells were collected in sample buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (34Giulian G.G. Moss R.L. Greaser M.L. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 129: 227-287Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Gels were silver-stained, dried down, and then exposed to a phosphorimager to determine the extent of phosphorylation. Radioactive bands were quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad), and contractile proteins were identified based on their migration relative to molecular weight markers (7Damron D.S. Darvish A. Murphy L. Sweet W. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Electrical Stimulation of Myocytes Maintained in Primary Culture and Measurement of Sarcomere Length in Cardiac Myocytes—Myocytes used for shortening assays were transferred the day after isolation to a plexiglas stimulation chamber consisting of 8 wells containing platinum electrodes mounted to the sides of each well and a glass bottom. Myocytes were electrically stimulated (2.5-ms pulse, 0.4 Hz) for 4 days in media 199 supplemented with P/S, 10 mm HEPES, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm glutathione (M199+), and media was replaced every 12 h (35Wahr P.A. Michele D.E. Metzger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11982-11985Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The voltage was set so that more than 50% of the myocytes were stimulated on each coverslip. Four days after gene transfer, individual coverslips are transferred to a temperature-controlled chamber mounted on a Nikon microscope stage and the chamber was filled with M199+. A video-based detection system (Ionoptix, Milton, MA, Ref. 36Helmes M Lim C.C. Liao R. Bharti A. Cui L. Sawyer D.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was used to detect sarcomere length in intact myocytes. The cell chamber temperature was maintained at 37 °C, and myocytes were stimulated at 0.2 Hz. Experiments were recorded for up to 30 min in 5-min intervals using SarcLen software (Ionoptix). An average of 10 twitches per myocyte were collected under basal conditions, and for each time point after introducing media containing ET, and/or PKC inhibitors. Maximal positive and negative time derivatives (+dl/dt max and –dl/dt max) were normalized with respect to shortening amplitude. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Grouped comparisons for phosphorimage densitometry and contractile function measurements made using the SarcLens software were analyzed using a 1-way analysis of variance and a Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test with p < 0.05 considered significantly different. Basal and Agonist-mediated TnI Phosphorylation by PKC in Adult Cardiac Myocytes—Our results on myocytes cultured in serum-free media demonstrate that cTnI phosphorylation observed during the 2-h [32P]orthophosphate labeling period is primarily due to PKC (Fig. 1). Evidence supporting this conclusion is based on the reduced phosphorylation observed during the labeling period in the presence of the PKC inhibitors chelerythrine (10 μm) or bisindolylmaleimide (bis-1, 500 nm, Fig. 1). Western blot analysis of adult myocytes cultured for 1–4 days demonstrated isoform expression of endogenous PKCα, δ, and ϵ remained unchanged during the culture period (Fig. 2), and PKCβ remained below detectable levels of expression over the same time period (results not shown). Thus, changes in PKC isoform expression were not responsible for the basal cTnI phosphorylation. Endogenous cTnI phosphorylation also was observed in previous studies on freshly isolated adult cardiac myocytes (7Damron D.S. Darvish A. Murphy L. Sweet W. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37Huang X.P. Pi Y. Lokuta A.J. Greaser M.L. Walker J.W. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1625-1634PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lester J.W. Gannaway K.F. Reardon R.A. Koon L.D. Hofmann P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1778-H1785PubMed Google Scholar), yet the signaling pathway(s) responsible for this basal phosphorylation remained undefined until now. Basal phosphorylation was not significantly influenced by inhibition of the ERK1/2 (PD98059, Fig. 1), or PKA (H-89; results not shown) pathways. Collectively, these results provide direct evidence that PKC is responsible for a significant component of the basal cTnI phosphorylation observed in intact myocytes (7Damron D.S. Darvish A. Murphy L. Sweet W. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Western blot analysis of PKC isoform expression in adult cardiac myocytes maintained in culture for 0, 2, and 4 days. Expression of PKC isoforms was detected using polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) to PKCα (1:400), PKCδ (1:100), and PKCϵ (1:100) followed by detection with goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Ab) conjugated to peroxidase (1:1000). The specificity of detection was determined by stripping each blot and re-probing in the presence of blocking peptides (BP) for each isoform (results not shown). A representative silver-stained portion of the gel with consistent protein expression that reflects protein loading is shown below the blot. Each BP specifically blocked recognition of the corresponding isoform, and results indicate there is maintenance of isoform expression when normalized for protein loading for at least 4 days in primary culture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ET-mediated activation of PKC significantly stimulated acute cTnI phosphorylation above basal levels within 10 min (Fig. 3, A and B, Table I). Enhanced contractile function was observed within this same time interval in previous studies on rat myocytes (24Kramer B.K. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), as well as in the present study (Fig. 4A, Table II). A representative time course with 10 nm ET in Fig. 3A shows an increase in cTnI phosphorylation to near maximal levels by 5 min, maintenance of elevated phosphorylation for up to 20 min, and then a decline over the next 20 min. Maximal phosphorylation was observed with 100 nm ET, and 10 nm ET produced near maximal phosphorylation of cTnI (Fig. 3B). An increase in myosin light chain 2 phosphorylation was observed in addition to cTnI with ET (Fig. 3B), in agreement with earlier work (7Damron D.S. Darvish A. Murphy L. Sweet W. Moravec C.S. Bond M. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 39Clement O. Puceat M. Walsh M. Vassort G. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Previously, troponin T (TnT) phosphorylation also was observed in response to other PKC agonists (40Montgomery D.E. Wolska B.M. Pyle W.G. Roman B.B. Dowell J.C. Buttrick P.M. Koretsky A.P.

In the present study, TnT was not significantly phosphorylated in mulitple experiments with 10–250 nm ET (Fig. 3B) over the 10–15 min time interval used for subsequent contractile function studies.Table IPKC-mediated cTnI phosphorylation in adult myocytesControlcTnIN-card/slow-C TnIBasal1.0 (20)1.13 + 0.11 (16)1.23 + 0.16 (16)10 nm ET1.58 + 0.25 (9)1.71 + 0.31 (9)2.49 + 0.54 (7)100 nm ET1.68 + 0.26 (3)2.09 + 0.37 (6)1.88 + 0.57 (5)250 nm ET1.47 + 0.12 (6)1.93 + 0.64 (4)2.28 + 0.62 (5)10 nm ET + 500 nm Bis-10.73 + 0.09 (4)0.99 + 0.23 (4)1.08 + 0.19 (7)10 nm ET + 10 μm Chelerythrine0.82 + 0.08 (6)0.95 + 0.12 (7)0.78 + 0.17 (6) Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Representative traces of sarcomere shortening made in isolated adult myocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2119278581,"Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is one of the earliest signaling events detected in response to lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) engagement during lymphocyte adhesion. In particular, the focal adhesion kinase p125FAK, involved in the modulation and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, seems to be a crucial mediator of LFA-1 signaling. Herein, we investigate the role of a FAK tyrosine phosphatase, namely low molecular weight phosphotyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP), in the modulation of LFA-1-mediated T cell adhesion. Overexpression of LMW-PTP in Jurkat cells revealed an impairment of LFA-1-dependent cell-cell adhesion upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Moreover, in these conditions LMW-PTP causes FAK dephosphorylation, thus preventing the activation of FAK downstream pathways. Our results also demonstrated that, upon antigen stimulation, LMW-PTP-dependent FAK inhibition is associated to a strong reduction of LFA-1 and TCR co-clustering toward a single region of T cell surface, thus causing an impairment of receptor activity by preventing changes in their avidity state. Because co-localization of both LFA-1 and TCR is an essential event during encounters of T cells with antigen-presenting cells and immunological synapse (IS) formation, we suggest an intriguing role of LMW-PTP in IS establishment and stabilization through the negative control of FAK activity and, in turn, of cell surface receptor redistribution."

Regulation of the secretion of apolipoprotein B is largely post-translational and reflects the balance between processes that leads to particle assembly or to intracellular degradation. Previously, we conducted a proteomic screen to find proteins that bind apolipoprotein B in rat liver microsomes. We identified ferritin heavy and light chains in this screen among other proteins and showed that the two ferritins bind apolipoprotein B directly in vitro. In hepatocytes and other cells, ferritin heavy and light chains form cytosolic cages that store iron. We now show that ferritin heavy or light chains post-translationally inhibit the secretion of apolipoprotein B without altering the export of other hepatic proteins including albumin, factor XIII, and apolipoprotein A–I. This inhibition of apolipoprotein B secretion is not due to diminished lipid synthesis and can be partially overcome by stimulating triglyceride synthesis. The block in apolipoprotein B secretion by ferritins leads to an increase in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of the apolipoprotein. Thus, despite being cytosolic proteins without known chaperone activity, ferritins can specifically regulate the secretion of apolipoprotein B post-translationally. The metabolic pathways for iron storage and intercellular cholesterol and triglyceride transport could intersect.

Chang B.H. Liao W. Oka K. Lau P.P. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2000; 55: 93-125PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of the secretion of apoB from hepatocytes occurs largely post-translationally (2Pullinger C.R. North J.D. Teng B.B. Rifici V.A. Ronhild de Brito A.E. Scott J. J.

Since cholesterol esters and triglycerides can only be secreted into the bloodstream with apoB, factors that regulate the secretion of this protein likewise impact plasma levels of these atherogenic lipids. In HepG2 cells, unassembled apoB can be targeted for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (5Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L.

Furthermore, factors that slow the translocation of apoB increase the number of ubiquitin-conjugated apoB molecules marked for degradation by proteasomes (8Chen Y. Le Caherec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol.

Other factors also regulate secretion since some ubiquitin-conjugated apoB can be deubiquitinylated and secreted (11Mitchell D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarath R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N.

The intertwined processes of lipidation, folding, translocation, intracellular degradation, quality control, and regulation of the secretion of apoB appear to involve many different hepatic proteins. In search of novel proteins that play such roles, we previously conducted a proteomic screen to identify proteins that bind apoB in hepatocytes. We identified ferritin heavy (H) and light (L) chains among many proteins that could be cross-linked to apoB in rat liver microsomes (16Rashid K.A. Hevi S. Chen Y. Le Caherec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22010-22017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins containing either ferritin H or L also bind apoB directly in vitro (16Rashid K.A. Hevi S. Chen Y. Le Caherec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22010-22017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Ferritin H and L store iron in the cytosol of cells. Despite some differences in their primary structure, ferritin H (molecular mass of 21 kDa) and L (molecular mass of 19 kDa) share a similar tertiary structure that permits the assembly of cages composed of 24 H and L subunits that can store over 4,000 iron atoms (17Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). In iron-storage tissues such as the liver and spleen, ferritin L subunits predominate. Both types of subunits are necessary for efficient storage of iron. Ferritin H contains a ferroxidase site, whereas ferritin L has residues that may nucleate ferrihydrite formation. In light of the physical interaction between these proteins, we investigated the role of ferritin H and L in the biogenesis of apoB. We show that ferritin H or L specifically inhibit the secretion of apoB. Reagents—LipofectAMINE 2000, Geneticin, and protein-A agarose were purchased from Invitrogen. Polyclonal antibody against apoB was obtained from Chemicon International, antibody against ferritins was from Fitzgerald Industries International, antiserum against factor XIII and antibody against ubiquitin were from Calbiochem, and antibody against albumin was from ICN. Protein G-agarose was purchased from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories. Glass plates for thin-layer chromatography manufactured by Merck were obtained from VWR. Oleic acid, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), and lactacystin were purchased from Sigma. [35S]methionine and [3H]acetate were purchased from ICN. Most other chemicals were obtained from Fisher. Lipid standards for thin-layer chromatography were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and Nu-Chek Prep. Tissue culture media and supplements were obtained from MediaTech. Plasmid Construction—The plasmid pcFerritinLight was constructed by amplifying the coding region for ferritin L by PCR using primers BamKFrtn, 5′-CGGGATCCGCCACCATGAGCTCCCAGATTCGTC-3′, and R1Frtn, 5′-CGGAATTCTTAGTCGTGCTTGAGAGTGAGC-3′, digesting the PCR product with BamHI and EcoRI, and ligating the purified insert into pcDNA3 at the same restriction sites. The plasmid pcFerritinHeavy was constructed in a similar manner but using the primers BamKFrtnH, 5′-CGGGATCCGCCACCATGACGACCGCGTCCACCTCG-3′, and R1FrtnH, 5′-CGGAATTCCTATGGGAAATTAGCCCGAGGC-3′. The plasmids were sequenced for verification. Cell Culture and Preparation of Stable, Transfected Cell Lines— HepG2 cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in an α modification of Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HepG2 cells were transfected in 10-cm dishes using 10 μg of plasmid DNA and 50 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 overnight. After 2 days, the cells were split and grown in α-modification of Eagle's medium containing 800 μg/ml Geneticin. After selection of individual clones, the cells were maintained in the same medium. Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Visualization—Cells were incubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium for 1 h, labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine, and chased in complete medium for 1 h unless otherwise noted. The medium was removed, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a microfuge at 4 °C for 10 min to remove cells and debris, and transferred to a new tube. The medium was made up to 1× Triton X-100 salt wash buffer (5Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were lysed in 1× Triton X-100 salt wash buffer with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged as the medium to remove cellular debris. The clarified cell lysates and medium were subjected to immunoprecipitation using polyclonal antibodies as specified. After rotating the samples with protein A- or G-agarose overnight in the cold room, the immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 1× Triton X-100 salt wash buffer and twice with Tris-NaCl (5Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The washed immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS-loading buffer with 0.5 m dithiothreitol and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were soaked in destain and then in 1 m sodium salicylate, dried, and exposed to film. The radioactivity of some samples was measured in an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. Each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. Precipitation of Secreted Proteins by Trichloroacetic Acid—The serum-free medium (see Fig. 2E) was recovered after a 1-h chase, and cellular debris was removed in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 10 min. Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid and the sample was incubated on ice for 30 min. The precipitated proteins were recovered by centrifugation for 5 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C and washed twice with cold acetone. After drying, the precipitated proteins were dissolved in SDS-loading buffer, resolved by electrophoresis, and visualized. TLC—Dishes of cells were incubated in medium containing 20 μCi/ml [3H]acetate for 2 h. Cellular lipids were extracted in chloroform/methanol (2:1), and equal aliquots were resolved by TLC (18Rusinol A.E. Lysak P.S. Sigurdson G.T. Vance J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2296-2304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid spots were visualized with iodine vapor, outlined with a pencil, scraped into scintillation vials, and counted. The c.p.m. were adjusted for the amount of cellular protein as measured by a protein assay kit from Bio-Rad. Increasing Ferritins by Iron Loading Leads to Decreased ApoB Secretion—We first assessed the secretion of apoB in the presence of increased levels of ferritin H and L induced by iron treatment. Translation of ferritin proteins is regulated by iron-regulatory proteins that bind to a stem-loop structure in the 5′-untranslated region of ferritin mRNA. This binding prevents translation; in the presence of iron, however, iron-regulatory proteins are released, and synthesis of ferritin H and L chains proceeds (17Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar, 19Rouault T. Klausner R. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 20Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Blood. 2002; 99: 3505-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). To induce synthesis of both ferritin H and L proteins, we treated HepG2 cells briefly with 10 μm FeSO4/10 μm 8-hydroxyquinolone which has been shown to be non-toxic to cells (21Van Lenten B.J. Prieve J. Navab M. Hama S. Lusis A.J. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2104-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This treatment causes a rapid and marked increase in the synthesis of ferritin H and L chains as compared with untreated HepG2 cells (Fig. 1A). Concomitant with this increase in ferritin synthesis, we observed that the amount of apoB in the medium of cells treated with ferrous sulfate was reduced (Fig. 1B). To distinguish whether this reduction is due to diminished secretion or decreased synthesis of apoB, HepG2 cells incubated in the absence or presence of ferrous sulfate were pulse-labeled with radioactive methionine and immediately lysed. Equivalent amounts of completed and elongating apoB are found regardless of treatment with iron (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we evaluated whether enhanced postsecretory removal of apoB is responsible for the reduced apoB in the medium of iron-treated cells. Untreated HepG2 cells and cells treated with ferrous sulfate were incubated with conditioned medium containing radiolabeled apoB. The amount of radiolabeled apoB recovered from the untreated and iron-treated HepG2 cells was similar (Fig. 1D). Therefore, treatment of HepG2 cells with ferrous sulfate leads to decreased secretion of apoB rather than decreased synthesis or increased removal of the apolipoprotein from the medium. Secretion is not affected globally since albumin, another endogenous protein of hepatocytes, is secreted normally (Fig. 1D). Thus, the treatment of hepatocytes with iron is associated with an increase in ferritin H and L synthesis and a selective decrease in the secretion of apoB. These data prompted us to test each ferritin chain further for its effect on apoB secretion in the absence of iron loading. Either Ferritin H or L Specifically Inhibits the Secretion of ApoB—To eliminate any redox effect of iron and to distinguish the role of each type of ferritin chain, we investigated the secretion of apoB in stable, transfected HepG2 cell lines. We transfected HepG2 cells with plasmids encoding either ferritin H or L that lacked the 5′-untranslated region so that the genes would be expressed constitutively rather than be subject to regulation by iron. Geneticin-resistant cell lines with increased expression of either ferritin H (H3) or L chains (L1) were isolated (Fig. 2A). Using metabolic labeling with radiolabeled methionine, we found that the secretion of apoB from H3 and L1 cells is markedly reduced (Fig. 2B). Three other cell lines expressing similar levels of ferritin were examined, and all inhibited apoB secretion by a proportion similar to H3 cells (data not shown). Likewise, three other cell lines with similarly elevated levels of ferritin L showed inhibition of apoB to the same proportion as L1 cells (data not shown). We also created stable HepG2 cell lines that were transfected with the empty vector. Eight clones of these Geneticin-resistant HepG2 cells were examined; all showed normal secretion of apoB (two are shown in Fig. 2B). Furthermore, other stable, transfected HepG2 cell lines expressing only Geneticin resistance have been reported to show normal secretion of apoB (22Xia H. Redman C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Therefore, neither Geneticin treatment nor overexpression of aminoglycoside phosphotransferase affect apoB secretion. Finally, the secretion of other proteins is not affected by ferritins. In H3 and L1 cells, elevated levels of ferritins do not affect the secretion of albumin or factor XIII (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, the secretion of apoA–I, the principal protein in high density lipoproteins, is normal in H3 and L1 cells (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the profile of radiolabeled proteins secreted by HepG2, H3, and L1 cells appears grossly similar (Fig. 3D). Thus, increased levels of either ferritin H or L specifically inhibit the secretion of apoB without blocking secretion in general. The Block in ApoB Secretion Induced by Ferritin H or L Is Not from Diminished Lipid Synthesis or Microsomal Triglyceride Transfer Protein (MTP) Activity—ApoB is secreted only when assembled with lipids as a lipoprotein particle. An adequate supply of the protein and lipids is necessary for normal secretion of apoB-containing lipoprotein particles. To assess whether ferritins diminish cholesterol and triglycerides and thereby impair apoB secretion, we measured lipid synthesis in HepG2, H3, and L1 cells using labeled acetate (18Rusinol A.E. Lysak P.S. Sigurdson G.T. Vance J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2296-2304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of labeled phosphatidylcholine, triglycerides, cholesterol, and cholesterol esters were not diminished in H3 or L1 cells as compared with HepG2 cells, indicating that synthesis of these lipids is not decreased (Fig. 4). In fact, the amount of labeled triglycerides was elevated significantly in H3 and L1 cells. This elevation could result from an increase in the synthesis or decrease in the removal of cellular triglycerides. In either case, elevated levels of ferritins inhibit secretion of apoB by a mechanism other than diminished lipid synthesis. The lipid transfer activity of MTP, a heterodimer with protein disulfide isomerase, is essential for the secretion of apoB (23Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Gay G. Rader D.J. Gregg R.E. Science. 1992; 258: 999-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 24Leiper J.M. Bayliss J.D. Pease R.J. Brett D.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Biol.

Biller S.A. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11991-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To rule out insertional inactivation or ferritin-mediated suppression of MTP activity, we assayed the levels of MTP activity in HepG2, H3, and L1 cells. The three cell lines had nearly identical levels of MTP lipid transfer activity as assessed by a fluorometric lipid transfer assay (data not shown). These data indicate that disruption of MTP activity is not the cause of the inhibition of apoB secretion seen in H3 or L1 cells. Thus, elevated levels of ferritin do not regulate apoB secretion through a decrease in the availability or MTP-mediated transfer of lipids. These data strongly suggest that ferritins act directly on the secretion of the apoB protein. The Block in ApoB Secretion Can Be Overcome Partially by Increased Triglycerides—Increased triglyceride synthesis normally stimulates the secretion of apoB. The decreased release of apoB in the face of elevated triglycerides in H3 and L1 cells raises the issue of whether the ferritin-induced block to secretion is responsive to further stimulation of triglyceride synthesis or is fixed at a maximum rate of secretion. To investigate this question, sets of dishes of untransfected HepG2, H3, and L1 cells were analyzed by pulse-chase labeling in the absence or presence of oleic acid to boost triglyceride synthesis. As expected, the secretion of apoB from HepG2 cells is markedly increased by oleic acid (Fig. 5). Treatment of H3 and L1 cells also raised secretion of apoB from these cells, and secretion nearly doubled with oleic acid similar to control cells. Thus, high levels of intracellular ferritin H or L do not limit triglyceride synthesis. However, this treatment did not increase secretion of apoB to levels seen in untransfected HepG2 cells. Indeed, even with oleic acid stimulation, H3 cells did not secrete as much apoB (by amount or percentage) as unstimulated HepG2 cells (compare Fig. 5, lanes 8 and 2 and graph). Thus, despite the marked stimulation to secretion by oleic acid, a ferritin-induced block of apoB secretion remains evident. This block is not absolute, however, because increased apoB can be recruited for secretion. The Post-translational Block in ApoB Secretion Leads to Secondary Degradation of ApoB—Control of apoB secretion primarily occurs through post-translational mechanisms. Therefore, we hypothesized that ferritins post-translationally regulate apoB secretion. If ferritins do not affect the translation of apoB, then the effect on secretion must be post-translational. Furthermore, we reasoned that an increased amount of apoB in H3 and L1 cells must be degraded intracellularly as either a primary or secondary event. If a block in apoB secretion is the principal event, then degradation would simply follow as a secondary event to dispose of excess intracellular chains of apoB. However, if increased degradation is the primary event, fewer apoB molecules would be available for secretion in H3 and L1 cells. In this second scenario, inhibiting degradation would lead to increased secretion of apoB. We investigated whether ferritins affect the translation of apoB and whether increased amounts of apoB are degraded in H3 and L1 cells. We pulse-labeled cells for 15 min followed by a chase period of 10 or 60 min. The short 10-min chase period permits elongating chains to become full-length, and since apoB requires more than 10 min to exit hepatocytes, the nascent proteins are all found in the cell lysates (Fig. 6A). ApoB is degraded in HepG2, H3, and L1 cells as evidenced by the difference in intracellular apoB between 10 and 60 min of chase even after accounting for the secreted proteins (Fig. 6A). However, the amount of apoB present in H3 and L1 cells at 10 min of chase is less than the amount of apoB found in control HepG2 cells. This difference could result from decreased synthesis or increased degradation of apoB in H3 and L1 cells. Therefore, we treated the three cell lines with ALLN, an inhibitor of proteasomes and other proteases that has been shown to decrease the degradation of apoB in HepG2 cells (26Sakata N. Wu X. Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22967-22970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When treated with ALLN, H3 and L1 cells contain similar amounts of apoB as control HepG2 cells after the short chase period (Fig. 6B, compare lanes 1, 3, and 5). Thus, H3 and L1 cells do synthesize equivalent amounts of apoB as control HepG2 cells; ferritins do not affect the translation of apoB. Instead, when high levels of ferritin are present, more apoB is degraded. Furthermore, this increased degradation is a consequence of a post-translational block in apoB secretion because inhibiting degradation does not increase secretion of the apolipoprotein. In the presence of ALLN, the levels of apoB in H3 and L1 cells remain similar to those in control HepG2 cells throughout the 60-min chase period. Despite similar intracellular levels of apoB, however, H3 and L1 cells do not secrete amounts of apoB comparable with control HepG2 cells (Fig. 6B). Therefore, preventing degradation does not rescue apoB proteins for secretion from H3 and L1 cells. Degradation then is a secondary event that follows the inhibition of apoB secretion. Taken together, these results establish that ferritins primarily block the secretion of apoB. Ferritins Cause Increased ERAD of ApoB—In hepatocytes, apoB can be degraded intracellularly by proteasomes via ERAD and other pathways. In HepG2 cells, the non-ERAD pathways are not sensitive to proteasome inhibitors (12Wu X. Sakata N. Lele K.M. Zhou M. Jiang H. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Since ALLN has activity against proteases other than just proteasomes, we repeated the experiment using lactacystin, an inhibitor that is specific for proteasomes. Similar to the results using ALLN, the degradation of apoB in H3 and L1 cells was inhibited, but secretion did not increase (Fig. 7). Furthermore, we isolated ubiquitin-tagged apoB in cells with high levels of ferritin by performing sequential immunoprecipitation using antibody against apoB followed by antibody against ubiquitin. As expected, some ubiquitin-tagged apoB molecules are present in control HepG2 cells. However, we found much more ubiquitin-tagged apoB in all cells that have high levels of ferritin whether induced by iron-loading or expressed by stable transfection (Fig. 8). Thus, in cells with high levels of ferritin H or L, the block in the secretion of apoB directs the apolipoprotein to ERAD. This increase in ERAD suggests that the post-translational block in apoB secretion induced by ferritin H or L occurs at the ER.Fig. 8Increased ubiquitin-conjugated apoB is found in cells with higher levels of ferritins. HepG2 cells left untreated (Ctrl), HepG2 cells treated with ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4), H3 cells, and L1 cells were placed in medium with ALLN for 2 h prior to labeling with [35S]methionine for 15 min. Following a 15-min chase period, the cell lysates were subjected to sequential immunoprecipitation using antibody against apoB and then with antibody against ubiquitin (8Chen Y. Le Caherec F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We demonstrate that ferritin H and L inhibit the secretion of apoB post-translationally. This effect of ferritins is not due to diminished lipid synthesis or alterations in MTP activity. As a consequence of this inhibition of secretion, increased apoB undergoes ERAD via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The block in secretion caused by either ferritin H or L appears specific for apoB. This conclusion is based on the normal secretion of a cross-section of proteins including albumin (an abundant protein), factor XIII (a less abundant protein that is secreted rapidly), and apoA–I (another apolipoprotein). Furthermore, the profiles of secreted proteins appears similar among HepG2, H3, and L1 cells. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that another protein is likewise affected, it appears that ferritins specifically inhibit the secretion of apoB. The precise mechanism by which ferritins specifically block the secretion of apoB is an area of ongoing investigation in our laboratory. Protein secretion is generally thought to be either constitutive or regulated via exocytosis from secretory vesicles. However, apoB secretion is regulated by post-translational mechanisms without the protein being stored in secretory vesicles. In addition to lipids and MTP activity, several stimuli including insulin, apolipoproteins, chaperone proteins, and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1β can alter the secretion of apoB (27Sparks J.D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9222-9229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1β decrease apoB secretion via epidermal growth factor receptor signaling (28Murthy S. Mathur S.N. Field F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9222-9229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and these two cytokines also increase levels of ferritins (20Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Blood. 2002; 99: 3505-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that ferritins could be the intracellular effectors that decrease apoB secretion by these two cytokines. The inhibition of apoB export by ferritins is a new example of regulation of protein secretion. Chaperone proteins anchored within the ER lumen, such as BiP, facilitate secretion of many proteins. One lumenal chaperone protein, MTP, appears to promote the secretion of apoB specifically (23Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz J. Gay G. Rader D.J.

Counterbalancing these factors, the cytosolic chaperone proteins, hsp70 and hsp90, stimulate ERAD of apoB (29Gusarova V. Caplan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24891-24900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and other proteins (30Zhang Y. Nijbroek G. Sullivan M.L. McCracken A.A. Watkins S.C. Michaelis S.

Furthermore, ferritins are not known to serve as protein chaperones. This report is the first evidence of the intersection between the seemingly disparate pathways for iron storage and lipoprotein secretion. Although this connection is new, abnormalities in intracellular iron and cholesterol transport have been linked previously. Several patients with Niemann-Pick disease, a disorder marked by defective intracellular transport of cholesterol, have been described who lack hepatic ferritins (33Christomanou H. Kellermann J. Linke R.P. Harzer K. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1995; 55: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 34Christomanou H. Harzer K. Biochem. Mol.

Metab. 2000; 70: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although not directly related to our data, these reports indicate a link between pathways for handling iron and lipids. Future investigations of ferritins and apoB in vivo should be conducted using appropriate models because not all conditions with high liver ferritin levels are equivalent. In hemochromatosis, for example, dysregulated intestinal iron absorption leads to tissue iron deposition and increased ferritin synthesis. The chronic iron deposition causes lipid peroxidation (36Britton R.S. Semin. Liver Dis. 1996; 16: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and functional and morphologic damage to the liver (37Bothwell T.H. MacPhail A.P. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 55-71PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hussain S.P. Raja K. Amstad P.A. Sawyer M. Trudel L.J. Wogan G.N. Hofseth L.J. Shields P.G. Billiar T.R. Trautwein C. Hohler T. Galle P.R.

These abnormalities would make it difficult to separate the toxic effects of iron from ferritins on apoB secretion either in affected homozygous C282Y humans or in a mouse model of hemochromatosis (39Zhou X.Y. Tomatsu S. Fleming R.E. Parkkila S. Waheed A. Jiang J. Fei Y. Brunt E.M. Ruddy D.A. Prass C.E. Schatzman R.C. O'Neill R. Britton R.S. Bacon B.R. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2492-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Thus, hepatocytes with elevated ferritins due to a high level of intracellular iron are not the same as cells expressing increased ferritins in the absence of an iron stimulus. (Our data using iron-loaded HepG2 cells (Fig. 1) simply prompted a more careful investigation of each ferritin chain on apoB secretion in stable cell lines, but these findings do not imply that the two types of cell systems are equivalent.) In H3 and L1 cells, ferritins are increased without iron loading. Similarly, increases in ferritin levels that do not stem from changes in intracellular iron can occur physiologically from cytokines and other non-iron stimuli of ferritin synthesis (20Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Blood. 2002; 99: 3505-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Therefore, a more relevant animal model to explore the relationship between ferritins and apoB is a mouse engineered to have altered levels of tissue ferritins without iron deposition in tissues. One such model is the ferritin H (+/–) mouse (40Ferreira C. Santambrogio P. Martin M.E. Andrieu V. Feldmann G. Henin D. Beaumont C. Blood. 2001; 98: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which has decreased levels of ferritin H and increased levels of ferritin L. We anticipate that this mouse model will help elucidate the intersection between the pathways used by ferritins and apoB. Other metabolic pathways could have similar connections. In our proteomic study, we found that apoB can be cross-linked to other metabolic enzymes (16Rashid K.A. Hevi S. Chen Y. Le Caherec F. Chuck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22010-22017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In view of our findings with ferritins, perhaps other metabolic pathways in hepatocytes intersect with the complex assembly of lipoproteins. Conversely, ferritin could alter the biogenesis or trafficking of other proteins along with apoB. In general, rather than acting only within the confines of discrete metabolic pathways, key proteins of different pathways could interact directly in intracellular metabolic networks.

MalK, the ATP-binding cassette of the maltose transporter of Escherichia coli, is distinct from most other ATP-binding cassettes in that it contains an additional C-terminal regulatory domain. The published structure of a MalK dimer is elongated with C-terminal domains at opposite poles (Diederichs, K., Diez, J., Greller, G., Muller, C., Breed, J., Schnell, C., Vonrhein, C., Boos, W., and Welte, W.

Superpositioning of the N-terminal domains of MalK onto the ATP-binding domains of an alternate ABC dimer, in which ATP is bound along the dimer interface between Walker A and LSGGQ motifs, places both N- and C-terminal domains of MalK along the dimer interface. Consistent with this model, a cysteine substitution at position 313 in the C-terminal domain of an otherwise cysteine-free MalK triggered disulfide bond formation between two MalK subunits in an intact maltose transporter. Disulfide bond formation did not inhibit the function of the transporter, suggesting that the C-terminal domains of MalK remain in close proximity throughout the transport cycle. Enzyme IIAglc still inhibited the ATPase activity of the disulfide-linked transporter indicating that the mechanism of inducer exclusion was unaffected. These data support a model for ATP hydrolysis in which the C-terminal domains of MalK remain in contact whereas the N-terminal domains of MalK open and close to allow nucleotide binding and dissociation.

These transporters utilize ATP to either import or export an extremely diverse array of substrates across cell membranes. They share a common structural organization consisting of two hydrophobic transmembrane-spanning domains or subunits and two nucleotide-binding domains or subunits. Forty-eight ABC transporters have been identified in the human genome, and defects in these transporters cause a variety of diseases including cystic fibrosis, macular dystrophy, and hyperinsulinemia (1Dean M. Hamon Y. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1007-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The maltose transporter of Escherichia coli is well characterized and serves as a model system for study of the ABC transport mechanism. The transporter complex (MalFGK2) comprises four subunits; one copy each of MalF and MalG, the transmembrane subunits: and two copies of MalK, the ATP-binding subunit (2Boos W. Lucht J.M.

A periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MalE or MBP) is also required for transport, functioning as a high affinity receptor for maltose that also stimulates the ATPase activity of the transporter by binding tightly to and stabilizing the catalytic transition state conformation of the transporter (4Chen J.

The structures of the ATP-binding subunits are highly conserved and usually consist of two domains. One domain is predominantly β-sheet and forms a classic nucleotide-binding fold as observed in the F1-ATPase (14Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2748) Google Scholar), and the second domain is α-helical and is specific to ABC transporters. The MalK protein differs in that it contains a third domain at its C terminus that is involved in regulatory functions, as deduced from mutational analysis (15Kuhnau S. Reyes M. Sievertsen A. Shuman H.A. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2180-2186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bohm A. Diez J. Diederichs K. Welte W. Boos W. J. Biol.

MalK binds MalT, a positive transcription factor that is required for expression of the genes involved in maltose transport and metabolism (17Panagiotidis C.H. Boos W. Shuman H.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Overexpression of MalK apparently sequesters MalT, preventing expression at the mal operons, whereas deletion of MalK leads to constitutive expression (18Reyes M. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4598-4602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bukau B. Ehrmann M. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 884-891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

IIAglc, an enzyme participating in the transport and phosphorylation of glucose, also appears to bind directly to MalK, inhibiting maltose transport when glucose is present by a mechanism known as inducer exclusion (15Kuhnau S.

However, sites of interaction between the subunits differed in each crystal igniting a controversy over the true nature of the interaction between nucleotide-binding subunits. A Rad50-like dimer interface was again seen in the crystal of the ABC subunit LolD (MJ0796) but only when a mutation was introduced into the ATP-binding site that stabilized the dimeric conformation of this protein (11Smith P.C.

In both Rad50 and MJ0796 dimers, the family signature or LSGGQ motif of one subunit makes contact with ATP bound to the nucleotide-binding or Walker A motif of the opposing subunit generating a configuration with two ATPs buried along the dimer interface (6Hopfner K.P.

Independent biochemical evidence of a Rad50-like dimer interface in the intact MalFGK2 transporter was obtained in our laboratory from the pattern of photooxidative cleavage induced by vanadate trapped in the position of the γ-phosphate of ATP (29Fetsch E.E. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9685-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). MalK is cleaved by vanadate at both Walker A and LSGGQ, indicating that both motifs lie in close proximity to ATP. Because the LSGGQ motif is too far from the ATP-binding site in the monomer to be cleaved by vanadate, it must contact ATP across the dimer interface. A similar architecture is observed in the structure of the intact vitamin B12 transporter BtuCD (13Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) but not in the structure of intact MsbA (12Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Assuming that all of the ABC proteins interact with nucleotide in the same way it appeared likely that HisP, MalK, and MsbA failed to crystallize in a physiologic dimeric conformation. In this report, we rotated the MalK subunits from the T. litoralis structure to generate a Rad50-like dimer and found that the C-terminal regulatory domains of MalK, which are located at opposite poles of the T. litoralis structure well away from the dimer interface, might contact each other across the dimer interface. In support of this model, we were able to cross-link the two MalK subunits within MalFGK2 without loss of ATPase activity or inhibition by IIAglc by introducing single cysteines into the C terminus of MalK. These data provide strong evidence of a stable interaction between C-terminal domains of MalK and new insight into the regulatory mechanism of inducer exclusion. Construction of Plasmids pMR81, pMR83, and pSSB1—Plasmid pMR81 is a ColE1 plasmid encoding ampicillin resistance and expresses the malF and malG genes under control of the ptac promoter. The cysteine residues that are normally present in the wild-type MalF and MalG proteins were changed to serine residues using site-directed mutagenesis with the oligonucleotides listed in Table I. The mutagenesis of each cysteine codon was carried out individually using single-stranded DNA generated from a plasmid containing the malF and malG genes and a M13 phage packaging site. Once the mutations were made and confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis, they were combined by fragment swapping to yield plasmid pMR81. This plasmid is fully able to complement null mutations in the malF and malG genes. Plasmid pMR83 is a P15A plasmid encoding chloramphenicol resistance and expresses the malK gene under control of the ptrc promoter; it is a derivative of the previously described plasmid pMR11 (15Kuhnau S. Reyes M. Sievertsen A. Shuman H.A. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2180-2186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three naturally occurring cysteine residues in MalK were changed to either glycine (Cys-40) or serine (Cys-352, Cys-362) by site-directed mutagenesis with the oligonucleotides listed in Table I. The mutagenesis of each cysteine codon was carried out individually using single-stranded DNA generated from a plasmid containing an EcoRI-SalI fragment representing most of the malK gene and a M13 phage packaging site. To combine the mutations at codons 352 and 362 two rounds of mutagenesis were performed; once the C352S mutation was created it was used as a template for the creation of the C362S mutation. Once the mutations were made and confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis, they were combined by fragment swapping to yield plasmid pMR83. This plasmid is able to fully complement a deletion of the malK gene. Finally, fragments of pMR83 and pSSGly (30Mannering D.E. Sharma S. Davidson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 376: 12362-12368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were combined to yield plasmid pSSB1, which encodes cysteine-free MalK with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag suitable for use in purification.Table IOligonucleotides used in mutagenesisOligonucleotideSequenceMalF C85S5′-CGATGGTGCT GACCAGAGG-3′MalF C304S5′-GCACCAGG CT CGCCAGAACC-3′MalF C388S5′-GCAAGCCCATGCT GAGGATC-3′MalG C106S5′-GCTAGGCGCT GGTGGTGGAG-3′MalK C40G5′-CGTCTGGCG GCGGTAAATCG-3′MalK C352S5′-CCAGAGCGTA GCCATCTGTT-3′MalK C362S5′-GGCACTGCAA GTCGTCGACC-3′MalK S162C5′-CGATGAACCGCTCTG CAACCTCGATGCTG-3′MalK I295C5′-CTACTGCCGAGTGATTG CGCTGACGTCATCCTT-3′MalK G311C5′-GTCGTCGAGCAACTCT GCAACGAAACTCAAATC-3′MalK E313C5′-GAGCAACTCGGCAACTGT ACTCAAATCCATATC-3′MalK D333C5′-GTGTACCGCCAGAACTG CGTGGTGTTGGTAGAA-3′ Open table in a new tab Construction of Plasmids Containing Single Cysteine Substitutions— Single cysteine substitutions were introduced into cysteine-free HisTagMalK by PCR using overlap extension (31Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6821) Google Scholar). The 5′–3′ sequences of the mutagenic primers are listed in Table I. PCR products were ligated into a variant of pSSB1 (pKPS2E-86) that has a unique PstI site inserted at codon 39 of malK generating a frameshift mutation. Replacement of the region containing the PstI insertion in pKPS2E-86 with the PCR product ensures, by both restriction digestion and Western blot analysis, that the PCR product has been successfully cloned into the vector. This plasmid also contains a unique NcoI site at the start of malK to facilitate subcloning. Clones were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and the absence of other errors introduced by PCR. Expression of the MalFGK2 Complex—A plasmid carrying the desired malK gene was cotransformed with pMR81 into strain HN741 (32Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) containing plasmid pMS421 that carries the lacIq gene. Transformants that expressed both MalF and MalK as judged by Western blotting were frozen at –70 °C in 8% glycerol and used to inoculate overnight cultures for larger scale preparations. Large scale preparations were grown in terrific broth (Invitrogen) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/ml spectinomycin until the A 600 reached 0.5–0.8, and then induced with 5–10 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown an additional 24 h. Expression of some of the mutants was improved if the temperature was maintained at 23 °C both before and after induction and if less isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (5 μm) was used in the induction. Cells were harvested and total membrane was isolated as described previously (3Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Purification—Histidine-tagged transport complexes were purified by affinity chromatography as previously described (27Davidson A.L. Sharma S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5458-5464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, membranes were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8), resuspended at a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml, and solubilized in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. Solubilized proteins were bound to a Talon metal affinity column (Clontech) equilibrated with Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% dodecyl maltoside). After washing the column with Buffer A to remove unbound protein, bound protein was eluted with Buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole. Proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.01% dodecyl maltoside. Purified preparations were either stored frozen at –70 °C or reconstituted into E. coli phospholipid vesicles by detergent dilution (3Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then stored at –70 °C. Assay of ATPase Activity—The ATPase activity of reconstituted transport complexes was measured at 37 °C in 20 mm HEPES (pH 8) with 2 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 μm MBP, and 0.1 mm maltose, as described previously (33Sharma S. Davidson A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6570-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A mutant is considered to be functional if MBP stimulates the ATPase activity of the reconstituted transporter. Disulfide Cross-linking by Cu(1,10-phenanthroline)2SO4 (CuPhen)— Prior to treatment with CuPhen, purified proteins (5 μg) or membranes (1 mg/ml) were treated with 10 mm DTT. The reaction mixtures (100 μl) were spun through Sephadex G-50 spin columns to remove DTT, and then incubated with the indicated concentration of CuPhen for 20 min as described. Essentially the same results were obtained at 0 or 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 5× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer containing 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide and no reducing agent (34Hunke S. Mourez M. Jehanno M. Dassa E. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15526-15534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose paper, and probed with antibody against MalK (35Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4254-4260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were then incubated either with horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody, and the bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) or Western Blue stabilized substrate (Promega). Expression and Purification of Enzyme IIAglc—PCR was used to amplify the gene encoding IIAglc from a colony of E. coli K-12, and a sequence encoding an additional six histidines was added to the 3′-end of the gene. The DNA was subcloned into the pET21 vector (Novagen) and transformed into BL21(DE3) for expression. Approximately 20 mg of protein, affinity-purified on Talon resin, was obtained from 1 liter of cells. Electrophoresis—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to the procedure of Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206965) Google Scholar) with the indicated percentage of acrylamide. Samples in SDS-loading buffer were not heated prior to loading. Protein Determination—Protein concentrations were determined as described previously (3Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by the method of Schaffner and Weissmann (37Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). Structural Alignment of MalK and the MJ0796 Dimer— Based on recent data indicating that the MalK subunits in the MalFGK2 transporter complex interact such that the LSGGQ motif of one subunit interacts with nucleotide bound to the Walker A of the opposing subunit (29Fetsch E.E. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9685-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we have superposed the two MalK monomers A and B from the structure of the T. litoralis dimer (7Diederichs K. Diez J. Greller G. Muller C. Breed J. Schnell C. Vonrhein C. Boos W. Welte W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5951-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) onto the structure of the MJ0796 dimer (Fig. 1) (11Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The MalK monomers are in a different conformation than the MJ0796 monomer, which appears to result from rotation of the helical domain containing the LSGGQ relative to the nucleotide-binding domain containing the Walker A (7Diederichs K. Diez J. Greller G. Muller C. Breed J. Schnell C. Vonrhein C. Boos W. Welte W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5951-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 10Gaudet R. Wiley D.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4964-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). As a consequence, alignment of the nucleotide-binding domains of MalK and MJ0796 resulted in the displacement of the helical domain and the LSGGQ motif away from the dimer interface in the MalK model (Fig. 1, compare A with E). In both MJ0796 and Rad50 dimers, serines from both the Walker A and the LSGGQ motif form hydrogen bonds with the γ-phosphate of ATP (6Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 11Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In our MalK dimer model (Fig. 1), the Walker A motif is similarly placed within hydrogen-bonding distance of ATP, but the oxygen of the serine of LSGGQ was either 8 (subunit B) or 12 Å (subunit A) from the corresponding oxygen in the γ-phosphate. It has been suggested that rotation of the helical domain and movement of the LSGGQ motif into the nucleotide-binding site upon binding of ATP may be part of the mechanism of activation of ATP hydrolysis and transport (8Yuan Y.R. Blecker S. Martsinkevich O. Millen L. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32313-32321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 13Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C.

Hence, this open dimer model (Fig. 1A) may approximate a resting state of the MalK dimer in the MalFGK2 transporter complex, and the structure of MJ0796 (Fig. 1E) may approximate an active state. In contrast to the crystallographic dimer of MalK from T. litoralis where the two C-terminal regulatory domains are at opposite poles of the dimer (Fig. 1F), our model, based on alignment with MJ0796, suggests that these domains may be in contact (Fig. 1B). Alignment of the MalK subunits onto the Rad50 (6Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar) or BtuCD (13Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) structures leads to the same conclusion, although the two C-terminal domains either display slight overlap (based on Rad50) or are spaced further apart (based on BtuCD) (data not shown). To test the validity of our model we placed cysteines in loops of MalK that were predicted to approach each other in the dimer, with the goal of forming an intratransporter disulfide bond that covalently links the two MalK subunits (Fig. 1, C and D). Cross-linking experiments were performed on the intact, purified MalFGK2 transporter complex. Functional Characterization of Cysteine-free MalFGK2 Transporter—The MalF, MalG, and MalK proteins that constitute the maltose transporter complex from E. coli contain seven native cysteines, but these have been removed with minimal impairment of transport function in vivo (34Hunke S. Mourez M. Jehanno M. Dassa E. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15526-15534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The genes encoding cysteine-free versions of MalF, MalG, and MalK used in our study differ from those of Hunke et al. (34Hunke S. Mourez M. Jehanno M. Dassa E. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15526-15534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in several minor ways. First, an N-terminal polyhistidine tag is attached to our MalK for the purpose of affinity purification; second, the source of our malK gene is E. coli rather than Salmonella (these genes are 95% identical including the locations of the three cysteines); and finally, the cysteine at position 40 of our MalK is replaced by glycine rather than serine. The cysteine-free MalF and MalG proteins are from E. coli in both systems and contain cysteine to serine substitutions at all sites. We found that the cysteine-free versions of MalF and MalG co-purified with cysteine-free HisTagMalK on metal-affinity resin (Fig. 2), as seen for the wild-type proteins although the yield of purified protein (0.6 mg/liter of cells) was substantially reduced from that generally obtained with the wild type (6 mg/liter of cells). The yield of the various mutants was generally improved using lower temperatures for growth and lower isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside concentrations (see “Experimental Procedures”) that improved the detergent solubility of the overexpressed proteins. The purified cysteine-free transporter complex when reconstituted into proteoliposomes exhibits MBP-stimulated ATPase activity, a good in vitro measure of function (32Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The rates of ATP hydrolysis (0.7–2 μmol/min/mg in the presence of MBP and maltose, 0.03 in the absence) generally range from 50–100% of that seen in parallel experiments with the wild-type transporter. Addition of Single Cysteine Substitutions into MalK—Single cysteines were individually introduced into E. coli MalK at positions 162, 295, 311, 313, and 333, residues that are predicted to be close to each other across the dimer interface in our model (Fig. 1, C and D). We also studied a transporter that contained one native cysteine at position 40 within the Walker A motif of MalK because disulfide bond formation between"

Exudates from the hypobranchial glands of various marine mollusks have been sources for dye compounds such as 6–6 dibromoindigo, the ancient dye Tyrian purple. BrMT represents the first correlation of a hypobranchial gland exudate with a molecular response.

Natural toxins are valuable tools for investigating ion channels. They expedite identification, purification and cloning of native channel types, permit in vivo manipulation of specific channels in complex tissues, such as the brain or heart, and can provide the basis for useful pharmaceuticals. In addition, they can serve as biophysical probes of channel function and permit structural deductions.In the case of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, many highly selective peptide toxins from a variety of venomous organisms have been described (1Harvey A.L. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and different toxins display distinct mechanisms of action. For example, scorpion Kα-toxins, which have been extensively used to map the extracellular region around the mouth of the conducting pore for Kv1 (Shaker-type) channels, block channels by occluding the conducting pore (2Naranjo D. Miller C. Neuron. 1996; 16: 123-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 3Gross A. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 399-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 4Aiyar J. Rizzi J.P. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. J. Biol.

Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In contrast, hanatoxin, a peptide isolated from a spider (6Swartz K.J. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1995; 15: 941-949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), alters the gating process that opens and closes Kv2.1 and Kv4.2 channels (7Swartz K.J. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 665-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and does not bind directly over the pore (8Li-Smerin Y. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, peptide toxins inhibit K channels by either blocking conduction through the pore or by stabilizing the gating machinery in one or more closed states. The vast majority of peptides display the former mechanism.We describe here a new natural product that produces inhibition of certain Kv channels. This toxin was isolated from Calliostoma canaliculatum, a common snail that inhabits kelp forests of the Pacific coast of the United States and Canada (9Morris R.H. Abbott D.P. Haderlie E.C. Intertidal Invertebrates of California. Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA1980: 250-251Google Scholar). When provoked by predatory starfish (Pycnopodia helianthoides or Pisaster giganteus) this snail repels the attacker by secreting a brilliant yellow mucus from its hypobranchial gland out of the shell aperture (10Bryan P.J. McClintock J.B. Hamann M. J. Chem. Ecol. 1997; 23: 645-658Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We find that this mucus inhibits activation of K currents (IK) through Shaker and other Kv1 channels. The bioactive compound was purified by following bioactivity through successive rounds of reverse-phase liquid chromatography and the final structure characterized via NMR and mass spectrometry. The active compound is not a peptide but a disulfide-linked dimer of 6-bromo-2-mercaptotryptamine (BrMT). 1The abbreviations used are: BrMT, 6-bromo-2-mercaptotryptamine; ESI-MS, Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry; FTICR, Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance; gHMBC, gradient-enhanced heteronuclear multiple bond correlation; HP, holding potential; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; IK, potassium current; MS, mass spectrometry; ps-gHMQC, phase-sensitive gradient-enhanced heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence; ShBD, Shaker BΔ6-46; SORI-CAD, sustained off-resonance irradiation collisionally activated dissociation; ACN, acetonitrile.1The abbreviations used are: BrMT, 6-bromo-2-mercaptotryptamine; ESI-MS, Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry; FTICR, Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance; gHMBC, gradient-enhanced heteronuclear multiple bond correlation; HP, holding potential; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; IK, potassium current; MS, mass spectrometry; ps-gHMQC, phase-sensitive gradient-enhanced heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence; ShBD, Shaker BΔ6-46; SORI-CAD, sustained off-resonance irradiation collisionally activated dissociation; ACN, acetonitrile. BrMT thus represents a new class of K channel inhibitor from a gastropod mollusc and appears to exert its effects on channel gating rather than by blocking the pore.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of the Active CompoundCalliostoma canaliculatum was collected from Monterey Bay, CA. Snails were anesthetized in a 1:1 mixture of 7.5% MgCl2 and sea water. The shell of an individual snail was cracked with a vise-grip and removed. The hypobranchial gland was surgically removed, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Hypobranchial glands from ∼100 animals were pooled and homogenized in an acidified acetone solution. This homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, and the yellow-brown supernatant stored at –20 °C in glass test tubes. The pellet was repeatedly extracted with acidified acetone in this fashion until the supernatant appeared clear. These extracts were pooled, dried under a stream of nitrogen gas, and resuspended in an aqueous solution of 5% acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. This material was loaded onto 10 g C18 separatory cartridges in an effort to remove salts and other non-bioactive components. The cartridges were then rinsed with water followed with a 40% ACN solution. The bioactive fraction was eluted using a 90% ACN + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution and stored at –20 °C.HPLC PurificationAn aliquot (600 μl, equivalent to about 2 glands worth of material) of the 90% ACN fraction obtained from the C18 cartridges was dried under a stream of nitrogen gas and resuspended in a 25 μl volume of 5% ACN and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Separation was then performed using 20 μl with a reversed-phase, microbore LC (Magic 2002, Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA) and a Reliasil C18 column (150 × 2.0 mm, 5 μm particle diameter and 300 Å pore size). For the first-stage separation, the mobile phase consisted of solvent A (98% H2O and 2% ACN + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v)) and solvent B (95% ACN and 5% H2O + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v)). A gradient was developed by increasing the fraction of solvent B from 5 to 98% over 34 min at a uniform flow rate of 70 μl per minute. Separation was monitored by absorption at both 240 and 280 nm. Fractions from the separation were obtained by using a fraction collector (Gilson FC 203B, Middletown, WI) and assayed for activity against Shaker channels heterologously expressed in mammalian HEK-293 cells (see below). The active fraction was dried under a stream of nitrogen gas and resuspended to a volume of 50 μl in 5% ACN and 0.1% (v/v) hepta-fluorobutyric acid (HFBA).For the second-stage separation, the HPLC system was equilibrated using a mobile phase consisting of solvent C (98% H2O and 2% ACN + 0.1% HFBA (v/v)), and solvent D (95% 2:2:1 ACN-isopropyl alcohol-methanol and 5% H2O + 0.1% HFBA (v/v)). Again, 20 μl of sample was injected for analysis. At a uniform flow rate of 60 μl per minute, a gradient was developed by increasing solvent D from 5 to 45% over 5 min, holding steady for 5 min, then changing from 45 to 65% over 20 min, holding steady for 5 min, and finally increasing from 65 to 98% over 5 min. Absorbance at both 240 and 280 nm was monitored, and fractions were assayed as described above.After initially developing the above procedures, a larger scale, single-stage separation was performed with freshly prepared extract using a Waters Analytical HPLC system and a 4.6 × 250 mm Sigma-Aldrich peptide column (5-μm particle diameter and 300 Å pore size). Performing the extraction and separation within hours eliminated the necessity of the second-stage separation to isolate the compound from degradation products. Gradient and solvent conditions were similar to the first-stage microbore procedure described above. Absorbance was monitored with a photodiode array detector scanning wavelengths from 280 to 600 nm. Absorbance at 433 nm was found to be optimal for selecting the fraction of interest.NMR ExperimentsAll NMR experiments were conducted using a Varian Unity-Inova 500 MHz narrow-bore NMR spectrometer with a Z-gradient 1H-13C-15N inverse-detection probe. Bioactive HPLC fractions were combined after separation of the material derived from ∼15 animals. This sample was either dissolved in CD3CN for use with a standard 5 mm NMR tube or in CD3OD for use with a 5 mm microtube. With its magnetic susceptibility matched specifically to CD3OD, the microtube allowed the entire sample to be situated in the NMR observation region with minimal degradation in spectral resolution, thereby reducing NMR experimental time.Spectra were referenced by the residual solvent peak. The standard Varian pulse sequences for one-dimensional 1H, ps-gHMQC, and gHMBC were employed. Routine acquisition and data processing parameters were used. For the ps-gHMQC spectrum, the evolution time interval was optimized to detect 1H-13C coupling constants of 140 Hz. For the gHMBC spectrum, the evolution time interval was optimized to detect 1H-13C coupling constants of 8 Hz. Moreover, for the gHMBC, a low-pass filter designed to suppress 1H-13C coupling constants of 140 Hz was included in the pulse sequence.ESI-MS of FractionsElectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was performed for the initial examination of the various peaks from the two stages of HPLC separation utilizing a Micromass Quattro (quadrupole-hexapole-quadrupole (QHQ) mass spectrometer). Data acquisition and processing were controlled by the Micromass MassLynx NT data system running on a PC platform. Fractions were dried under a stream of nitrogen gas and reconstituted in 10–500 μl of ACN with 1% formic acid for injection into the ESI-MS system.Identification of BrMT and assessment of purity within HPLC fractions were facilitated by the use of an electrospray ion-trap mass spectrometer fitted with a static, nanospray source and using the Xcalibur data system (LCQ Deca, Thermo-Finnigan). An aliquot of ∼10 μl was taken from a fraction, dried under a stream of nitrogen gas and reconstituted in 10 μl of 50/50 (v/v) CH3OH and H2O with 0.1% formic acid. The sample was loaded into a tapered, gold coated, borosilicate nanospray emitter tip (PicoTip™, New Objective, Woburn MA) with capillary temperature of 220 °C and potential of 44 V. An optimized spray voltage of 1.3 kV was employed, and the tube-lens offset was adjusted to minimize source-induced fragmentation of the parent peak. This method was also used for ion trap tandem MS experiments.All high-resolution mass spectrometry experiments were conducted on a home-built 2.7 Tesla Fourier-transform mass spectrometer described elsewhere (11Price W.D. Schnier P.D. Williams E.R. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Ions are generated using nano-electrospray ionization (nano-ESI) from 50/50 water/acetonitrile solutions. A 0.78-mm inner diameter borosilicate capillary pulled to a fine (∼4 μm) aperture is filled with several μl of the analyte-containing solution. A platinum wire running down the center of the solution-filled capillary is used as an electrode with an applied potential of +0.8–1.2 kV.Exact mass measurements are made using four internal standards, arginine, tryptophan, dilysine, and the pentapeptide leucine-enkephalin, which produce (M+H)+ ions with m/z values ranging from 175 to 556. The possible elemental compositions for the ions in the samples are determined from exact mass measurement using the Spectral Interpreter module provided with the Odyssey software.For the tandem mass spectrometry experiments, an ion of interest was isolated using a series of stored waveform inverse Fourier-transform, chirp, and single frequency excitation waveforms. These mass-selected ions are fragmented either by IRMPD using a continuous wave CO2 laser at 10.6 μm (12Jockusch R.A. Paech K. Williams E.R. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2000; 104: 3188-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or by SORI-CAD (13Gauthier J.W. Trautman T.R. Jacobson D.B. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1991; 246: 199-210Crossref Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Both of these techniques deposit energy into the ion slowly and produce relatively gentle dissociation, resulting in a limited number of fragment ions. A broad-band radio frequency chirp is used to excite all ions for detection. Data are acquired using a Finnigan Odyssey system (Finnigan MAT; Bremen, Germany).BrMT Solutions Used for Physiological ExperimentsTwo BrMT stock solutions were used. One contained 3.8 mm BrMT in deuterated methanol and had previously been utilized for NMR analysis. The other contained 3.7 mm BrMT in a mixture of H2O/ACN/TFA resulting from HPLC purification. These solvents had no significant effect on channel properties at the dilutions used to study BrMT.Channel ExpressionOocytes. Xenopus laevis oocytes were surgically removed, defolliculated with collagenase and stored at 17 °C in ND96 solution (in mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2,and5mm HEPES (pH 7.6 with NaOH) plus 10 μg/ml gentamycin. K channel cRNAs were transcribed using a kit following the manufacturer's protocols (mMessage Machine, Ambion; Austin, TX), and oocytes were injected 2–7 days prior to recording. The following clones (gifts as indicated) were utilized: Drosophila ShakerBΔ (6–46) (ShBΔ (14Hoshi T. Zagotta W. Aldrich R. J. Gen.

Cells were plated onto untreated glass coverslips and transfected using standard CaPO4 methods (22Brock M.W. Mathes C. Gilly W.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recordings were carried out 1–4 days post transfection. The ShBΔ channel expressed in mammalian cells contained the additional mutations C301S, C308S and T449V (23Holmgren M. Jurman M. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and was a gift of G. Yellen, Harvard University.ElectrophysiologyWhole Oocytes—A two-electrode voltage clamp (Dagan TEV-200; Minneapolis, MN) was used, and data were acquired with a Macintosh computer and ITC-16 interface (Instrutech Corp; Elmont, NY) running either the Pulse Control extension package (Herrington and Bookman, 1995) with Igor Pro (Wavemetrics Inc.; Lake Oswego, OR) or the Pulse software package (HEKA Electronik). Records were filtered at 1–5 kHz and digitized at 10–20 kHz. P/n leak subtraction protocols were used. Microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had tip resistances of <1.5 MΩ.Recordings from EAG, Kv4.1, Kv4.2, Kv3.1 and hKv1.1 used a bath solution of (in mm): 98 NaOH, 7.5 KOH, 1.5 CaCl2, 15 HEPES, (pH 7.0 with methanesulfonic acid). A similar solution was used for ShBΔ, sqKv1A and Kv2.1: 90 NaOH, 20 RbOH, 2 nm CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 20 HEPES (pH 7.0 with methanesulfonic acid). In addition, 1 mm diamide was added to these solutions to buffer oxidative conditions in experiments with ShBΔ, sqKv1A, Kv2.1 and hKv1.1. Addition of diamide did not alter the effects of BrMT with ShBΔ, but the other channels were not tested.A low-volume flow-through chamber was used for recording. Solution exchange was calibrated with TEA-containing solutions to achieve >95% solution exchange with 0.5 ml. Typically, this volume was flushed through to add BrMT, and several minutes were required for the effects of BrMT on K currents to stabilize. The effects of BrMT were not readily reversed by washout with whole oocytes.Oocyte Patches—Excised patch recordings were made in the outside-out configuration using an Axopatch 1-B amplifier (Axon Instruments; Foster City, CA). Data were collected as described above for whole oocytes, except filtering was at 2 kHz, and sampling was at 20 kHz. External solutions contained (in mm) 115 NaCl, 10 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 20 HEPES (pH 7.2 with HCl). Internal solutions contained 90 KF, 20 KCl, 30 KOH, 10 EGTA, 20 HEPES (pH 7.2 with HCl). Pipette tip-resistances with these solutions was <2 MΩ.Solutions were applied to excised patches using a delivery manifold (DAD-12, ALA Scientific Instruments; Westbury, NY) with a 100-μm diameter port and a pressure of 200 mm Hg. The effect of 5 μm BrMT in this configuration required several seconds to reach completion and several minutes to washout.Mammalian Cells—Ionic currents from ShBΔ channels were recorded from transfected mammalian cells in the whole-cell patch-clamp mode using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments; Foster City, CA). Data were collected as described above for whole oocytes, except filtering was at 2 kHz and sampling at 50 kHz. Internal and external solutions were the same as used for excised patches.Squid Giant Fiber Lobe Cells—Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from isolated squid giant fiber lobe cells were carried out as described previously (22Brock M.W. Mathes C. Gilly W.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).RESULTSEffects of Yellow Defensive Mucus on Native and Cloned K Channels—Naturally secreted defensive mucus was collected with a pipette after stimulating a snail with the tube foot from a predatory starfish. Effects of this mucus were tested on two extensively studied K channel preparations after diluting the material an additional 50-fold in the appropriate external recording solution. Calliostoma mucus slows the apparent time-course of activation and reduces peak amplitude of IK through both native delayed-rectifier K channels in the squid giant axon system (Fig. 1A) and heterologously expressed Shaker (ShBΔ) channels (Fig. 1B). Although the effects are qualitatively similar, they clearly differ in degree. In neither case are deactivation kinetics affected.Isolation of a Non-peptidic K Channel Inhibitor—Details of the purification of the active compound in the yellow defensive mucus are given under “Experimental Procedures.” After extraction of pooled glands, the homogenized material was subjected to several clean-up steps in order to reduce the high concentrations of salts and lipids from the matrix. Slowing of IK activation in voltage-clamp experiments as described above was used as the criterion for screening fractions. The active compound was found to retain an intense yellow color, absorbing at wavelengths in the violet region of the visible spectrum, and can thus be visually followed throughout the purification process.Representative chromatograms of microbore HPLC elution of the active compound are presented in Fig. 2. The first-stage separation (Fig. 2A) yields a peak of sufficient purity for structural identification. Once separated from other components of the extract, the active compound degrades. Should partial degradation occur, the remaining active compound can be isolated from degradation products by a second-stage separation (Fig. 2B). Bioactivity tests using ShBΔ channels expressed in mammalian cells clearly identified the peak eluting at ∼23 min as that containing the compound of interest.Fig. 2Microbore HPLC purification of the bioactive compound. A, reverse-phase HPLC chromatogram illustrating the first-stage purification of BrMT (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The illustrated trace represents absorbance at 240 nm. The peak of interest is observed at ∼23 min. B, reverse-phase HPLC chromatogram illustrating the second-stage purification. Absorbance was monitored at 240 nm. The BrMT peak is observed at 23 min. C, final deduced structure of the active component that inhibits K channel activation. The compound is a disulfide-bonded dimer of 6-bromo-2-mercaptotryptamine.

MS techniques were also used to corroborate the structural identity and purity of bioactive isolates used in subsequent physiological experiments. Results obtained with each technique are described below.1H-NMR— Table I gives the NMR data used in the structural determination of the bioactive agent. The deduced structure is presented in Fig. 2C with the corresponding NMR assignments. Fig. 2D displays one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of the compound dissolved in CD3CN. Addition of D2O to eliminate resonance arising from exchangeable protons (Fig. 2E) prompted the disappearance of resonances at 6.62 (peak HC) and 9.94 ppm (peak HG) as well as the collapse of the sextet at 3.07 ppm (peak HB) to a triplet. The exchangeable proton resonance near 10 ppm integrates to a relative value of one, suggesting the compound is an indole derivative. This putative indole accounts for the 6 double-bond equivalents obtained from Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) (see below).Table I1H and 13C NMR data in CD3OD (unless otherwise noted)1H13CPeakChemical shiftIntegrationMult.

From the 1H-1H coupling constants, all three aromatic peaks are assigned to the larger ring subunit such that either the 5 or 6 indole position is occupied by another substituent. Integration and chemical shift data indicate that the primary amine is protonated when the sample is dissolved in CD3CN. In addition, the spectrum in Fig. 2D does not display any peak assignable as a thiol resonance, consistent with a disulfide bond between two identical indole derivatives as illustrated in the assigned structure (Fig. 2C).Multidimensional and Heteronuclear NMR—To complete the structural assignment, heteronuclear correlation experiments were conducted in CD3OD, and results are listed in Table I. The combined ps-gHMQC and gHMBC data indicate the presence of ten carbon resonances, in accordance with the MS studies, and provide strong evidence for the ethylamine moiety being at the 3-position of the indole ring and for the 6-position of the indole ring being substituted. Of particular importance for the gHMBC data analysis considered here, aromatic 1H-13C coupling constants across two bonds (geminal) (24Pretsch E. Clerc T. Seibl J. Simon W. Tables of Spectral Data for Structure Determination of Organic Compounds. Second Edition Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg1989Crossref Google Scholar) are smaller than those across three bonds (vicinal). Although the empirically based 13C chemical shift calculations were inconclusive, the 1H chemical-shift calculations clearly suggest that the 6-position of the indole is occupied by the bromine substituent over the alternate choice of sulfur (24Pretsch E. Clerc T. Seibl J. Simon W. Tables of Spectral Data for Structure Determination of Organic Compounds. Second Edition Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg1989Crossref Google Scholar). Sulfur is consequently assigned to the 2 position.Fourier-Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FTICR-MS)—FTICR-MS analysis identified the active component by comparing electrospray ionization spectra from HPLC fractions of differing bioactivity. Three ions of interest, corresponding to a singly brominated ion at m/z 237/239 and 270/272 and a doubly brominated ion at m/z 539/541/543, were identified. The nature of the isotope patterns of the m/z 270/272 and 539/541/543 clusters indicates the presence of one and two sulfurs, respectively. Assignment of the m/z 270/272 peaks (exact mass 269.9832 ± 0.0011) as the compound of interest yielded a putative molecular formula of C10H11N2SBr, a double bond equivalent (DBE) of 6 with a +4.1 ppm error from the calculated exact mass. Assignment of the m/z 237/239 peaks (exact mass 237.0019 ± 0.0015) yielded a likely molecular formula of C10H10N2Br, a double bond equivalent (DBE) of 6.5 with a –1.2 ppm error from the calculated exact mass. Using the NMR and FTICR-MS data, the bioactive agent has been assigned the structure of a disulfide bonded dimer of 6-Br-2-mercaptotryptamine (BrMT) (Fig. 2C).Reduction and Oxidation Reveal BrMT Dimerization—MS analysis of the sample used for the NMR work strongly suggests that the bioactive compound has mass of 538 Da (protonated mass 539). The odd electron ion, C10H11N2 SBr+· (m/z 270/272) (Fig. 3A), is not always present in the initial electrospray spectra, but grows in with time, as observed by FTICR-MS. This indicates that it is formed by electrochemical reduction in the electrospray solution. The even electron ion, C10H10N2Br+ (m/z 237/239; Fig. 3A), is formed by gas-phase dissociation of the parent ion (m/z 539/541/543). The measured mass spectra"

The present study was undertaken to determine whether cytochrome c release was responsible for ischemia-induced loss in mitochondrial function. Rat hearts were perfused in Langendorff fashion for 60 min (control) or for 30 min followed by 30 min of no flow ischemia. Mitochondria isolated from ischemic hearts in a buffer containing KCl exhibited depressed rates of maximum respiration and a lower cytochrome c content relative to control mitochondria. The addition of cytochrome c restored maximum rates of respiration, indicating that the release of cytochrome c is responsible for observed declines in function. However, mitochondria isolated in a mannitol/sucrose buffer exhibited no ischemia-induced loss in cytochrome c content, indicating that ischemia does not on its own cause the release of cytochrome c. Nevertheless, state 3 respiratory rates remained depressed, and cytochrome c release was enhanced when mitochondria from ischemic relative to perfused tissue were subsequently placed in a high ionic strength buffer, hypotonic solution, or detergent. Thus, events that occur during ischemia favor detachment of cytochrome c from the inner membrane increasing the pool of cytochrome c available for release. These results provide insight into the sequence of events that leads to release of cytochrome c and loss of mitochondrial respiratory activity during cardiac ischemia/reperfusion.

Cardiovascular disease characterized by diminished coronary blood flow is a leading cause of debilitation and mortality worldwide. Immediate consequences of oxygen deprivation are a reduction in the rate of oxidative phosphorylation, incomplete oxidation of glycolytic metabolites, depletion of creatine phosphate and ATP, and metabolic acidosis (1Murfitt R.R.

This deficit in activity would limit restoration of normal cardiac function upon reintroduction of blood flow. It is therefore critical to define molecular mechanism(s) responsible for ischemia-induced inactivation of mitochondrial function. We have previously reported that, in an isolated rat heart model, ischemia results in inhibition of complex I with no alterations in other respiratory chain complex activities (11Lucas D.T. Szweda L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6689-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The results of in vitro studies revealed that respiratory complex activities must be reduced by greater than 50% to exert effects on maximum rates of mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis (11Lucas D.T. Szweda L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6689-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore complex I inactivation was of insufficient magnitude to account for ischemia-induced declines in the respiratory activity of isolated mitochondria (11Lucas D.T. Szweda L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6689-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is important to note, however, that complex activities are measured upon the addition of specific electron carriers. Thus, release of respiratory chain components during ischemia may be overlooked as contributing factors in the loss of mitochondrial respiration when standard assays for complex activities are utilized. One such electron transport chain component is cytochrome c, a protein required for the transfer of electrons from complexes III to IV. In the current study, we utilized an isolated buffer-perfused rat heart model to investigate mechanism(s) by which mitochondrial respiratory function is impaired during cardiac ischemia. It has previously been reported that mitochondria isolated from ischemic myocardial tissue exhibit a decrease in the characteristic absorbance of cytochrome c (3Piper H.M. Sezer O. Schleyer M.

We sought immunochemical and chromatographic evidence that ischemia induces alterations in the association of cytochrome c with inner membrane components and that these events are responsible for diminished rates of NADH-linked ADP-dependent mitochondrial respiration. In addition, we utilized different mitochondrial isolation buffers and performed in vitro studies with intact cardiac mitochondria to determine when in the sequence of events cytochrome c dissociated from the inner mitochondrial membrane and was subsequently released into cytosolic extracts. Preparation and Perfusion of Isolated Rat Heart—The hearts were isolated from adult (6–8 months of age) male Fisher-344 rats (National Institute of Aging colony) and perfused in retrograde fashion as described previously (10Lucas D.T. Szweda L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 11Lucas D.T. Szweda L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6689-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, the rats were administered heparin (500 units) and sodium pentobarbital. The heart was rapidly removed through a midline incision and rinsed in ice-cold modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm KH2PO4, 22 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose). After the extraneous tissue was removed, the aorta was cannulated, and the heart was perfused in retrograde fashion according to the Langendorff procedure (10Lucas D.T. Szweda L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 11Lucas D.T. Szweda L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Throughout each protocol, the hearts were immersed in a water-jacketed chamber (37 °C) and paced at 300 beats/min. Left ventricular pressure was monitored utilizing a pressure transducer within a latex balloon placed into the left ventricle. The balloon was inflated to an initial left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 5.0 mm Hg. Experiments consisted of: (i) 60-min normoxic perfusion or (ii) 30-min normoxic perfusion followed by 30 min no flow ischemia. Isolation of Subsarcolemmal Rat Heart Mitochondria and Cytosolic Fractions—Subsarcolemmal mitochondria were isolated from the ventricles as follows. The ventricles were rapidly dissected and rinsed in ice-cold homogenization buffer (180 mm KCl, 5.0 mm MOPS, 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS, 3-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 2.0 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, or 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5.0 mm MOPS, 1.0 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, as indicated). The ventricles were blotted dry, weighed, minced with scissors, and then homogenized in 20 ml/g of tissue in cold homogenization buffer (Polytron homogenizer, low setting, 3 s). The homogenate was then centrifuged at 500 × g for 5.0 min. The supernatant was filtered through cheese cloth and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10.0 min. The mitochondrial pellet was washed twice and resuspended into homogenization buffer at a final protein concentration of ∼30.0 mg/ml. The 5,000 × g supernatant represented the cytosolic fraction (protein concentration, ∼1.5 mg/ml). All manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. For in vitro studies, cardiac mitochondria and cytosolic fractions were prepared from rat hearts immediately following euthanasia with a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbitol. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchroninic assay (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as standard. Evaluation of Mitochondrial O2 Consumption—Rates of NADH-linked ADP-dependent (state 3) and ADP-independent (state 4) respiration were measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Instech, Plymouth Meeting, PA) as described (10Lucas D.T. Szweda L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 11Lucas D.T. Szweda L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6689-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria were diluted to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in assay buffer (120 mm KCl, 5.0 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.25, or 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5.0 mm KH2PO4, 1.0 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, as indicated) and placed in a sealed oxygen chamber. Respiration was initiated by addition of glutamate (15 mm). After 2.0 min, state 3 respiration was induced by addition of ADP (0.5 mm). Upon depletion of ADP, the rate of state 4 respiration was evaluated. Where indicated, respiration was monitored upon addition of cytochrome c (7.0 μm) at the time of initiation of respiration. Detection of Cytochrome c by Western Blot Analysis—Mitochondria prepared from isolated rat hearts exposed to perfusion (60 min) or ischemia (30 min perfusion followed by 30 min ischemia) were diluted to 1.0 mg protein/ml in 5.0 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.25. An equal volume of 2× sample buffer (126 mm Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol, 4.0% SDS, 1.0% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) was then added. The samples were loaded onto 14% Tris-buffered polyacrylamide gels, and component proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Novex Mini-cell II). The proteins were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm), and cytochrome c was detected utilizing monoclonal anti-cytochrome c (PharMingen) as primary antibody and anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase as secondary antibody. Primary antibody binding was visualized with an alkaline phosphatase-based chemiluminescence system (Tropix). As indicated, densitometric analyses were performed utilizing NIH Image software. Quantitation of Mitochondrial Cytochrome c Content by Reverse Phase HPLC—Cardiac mitochondria (60.0 μl at 5.0 mg/ml) prepared from hearts following perfusion (60 min) or ischemia (30 min perfusion followed by 30 min no flow ischemia) were diluted into an equal volume (60.0 μl) of 5.0 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, pH 7.25. Cytochrome c was then reduced upon treatment with 100 mm NaBH4, 0.1 mm NaOH (13.0 μl) for 10.0 min at 25 °C. Reduction was quenched by the addition of 5.0 μl of acetone. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5.0 min, the supernatant (100.0 μl) was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (Vydac C18 column; 1.0 ml/min; 0–100% CH3CN versus H2O, containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, in 20.0 min; Hewlett-Packard model 1050 liquid chromatograph equipped with a UV diode array detector). Under the HPLC conditions utilized in our experiments, cytochrome c eluted at 13.0 min. Cytochrome c levels were quantified relative to a standard curve constructed with known quantities of purified cytochrome c (Sigma) treated in identical fashion. Electron Microscopy—Mitochondria were isolated from ischemic and reperfused myocardial tissue in mannitol/sucrose buffer by density centrifugation as detailed above. The mitochondrial fraction was resuspended and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (12 h). Mitochondria were post-fixed utilizing 1% OsO4. En bloc staining with uranyl acetate was followed by dehydration with increasing concentrations of ethanol. Resin PolyBed 812 was used for sample infiltration and embedding. Embedded samples were sectioned and affixed to grids according to standard protocols. Mitochondrial ultrastructure was then evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (JEOL 1200 CX electron microscope). Statistical Analysis—The data were evaluated utilizing a two-tailed t test. Statistical significance was assigned for p ≤ 0.05, as indicated. Effect of Cardiac Ischemia on Cytochrome c Content of Mitochondria—Cardiac ischemia was found to induce a loss in the cytochrome c content of isolated mitochondria. Hearts excised from adult rats were perfused for 60 min or for 30 min followed by 30 min no flow ischemia as described under “Materials and Methods.” Myocardial tissue was homogenized in a buffer composed of 180 mm KCl, 5.0 mm MOPS, 1.0 mm EDTA, pH 7.25. Mitochondria were then isolated by density centrifugation, and cytochrome c content was assessed by Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies raised to cytochrome c. As shown in Fig. 1, mitochondria from ischemic myocardial tissue contain 40% of the cytochrome c content relative to perfused values as estimated by densitometry. This finding was confirmed by experiments in which cytochrome c was extracted from mitochondria, chemically reduced, and quantified using reverse phase HPLC analysis. Mitochondria isolated from perfused and ischemic tissue contained 3.75 ± 0.31 and 1.83 ± 0.12 μg of cytochrome c/mg of protein (p ≤ 0.001 for a two-tailed t test), respectively. Loss of cytochrome c from the mitochondria was accompanied by a concomitant increase in cytosolic levels of the protein. As shown in Fig. 1, a 2-fold (p ≤ 0.005 for a two-tailed t test) increase in the cytochrome c content of cytosolic extracts prepared from ischemic versus perfused cardiac tissue was observed. Effect of Cytochrome c Addition on Respiratory Activity of Mitochondria Isolated from Perfused and Ischemic Myocardial Tissue—Respiratory rates were assessed in a buffer composed of 125 mm KCl and 5.0 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.25. Ischemia (30 min) was found to induce a 41.8% loss in NADH-linked ADP-dependent (state 3) respiration relative to control mitochondria (p ≤ 0.00001). This decrement in respiratory activity was abolished upon addition of cytochrome c (14.0 nmol/mg mitochondrial protein) to isolated respiring mitochondria (Fig. 2). Thus, ischemia-induced release of cytochrome c from cardiac mitochondria (Fig. 1) is largely responsible for the observed declines in maximal rates of respiration (Fig. 2). Mitochondrial state 4 respiratory rates, ADP/O, and yield were not altered by ischemia, indicating that ischemia did not cause global disruption of mitochondria. Importantly, the respiratory chain appears accessible to exogenously added cytochrome c. This suggests that ischemia and/or isolation conditions induce alterations in the outer mitochondrial membrane, which provide exit and entry for cytochrome c. Ischemia-induced Isolation-dependent Release of Cytochrome c—The results presented in Fig. 1 do not indicate when in the sequence of events cytochrome c is released from mitochondria. This may occur during ischemia and/or during the isolation process. There are two commonly used homogenization buffers for mitochondrial isolation. To reflect physiologic K+ ion in the cytosol, KCl is employed in the buffer to establish an appropriate osmotic strength. It is well known, however, that exposure of mitochondria to KCl induces extrusion of cytochrome c (13Doran E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Gogvadze V. Robertson J.D. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19066-19071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15Ott M. Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Alternatively, inclusion of mannitol and sucrose instead of KCl in the homogenization buffer is generally considered less disruptive to mitochondrial integrity. Isolated rat hearts were therefore subjected to 60 min of perfusion or to 30 min of perfusion followed by 30 min of ischemia. The hearts were homogenized in 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5.0 mm MOPS, 1.0 mm EDTA, pH 7.25. Mitochondria and cytosolic extracts were then prepared and evaluated for cytochrome c content. In striking contrast to mitochondria isolated in KCl containing buffer (Fig. 1), mitochondria isolated in mannitol/sucrose exhibited no detectable decrease in cytochrome c content as a result of ischemia (Fig. 3). In keeping with this result, relatively little cytochrome c was detected in cytosolic extracts of either perfused or ischemic tissue (Fig. 3). The potential exists that K+-dependent release of cytochrome c would occur in situ upon extended periods of ischemia. Nevertheless, mitochondria and cytosolic extracts prepared in mannitol/sucrose homogenization buffer from rat hearts (n = 3) that had undergone 60 min of ischemia did not exhibit any decrease or increase in cytochrome c content, respectively, relative to perfused values (not shown). These findings indicate that, even with prolonged periods of ischemia, cytochrome c is not released from the mitochondria. Nevertheless, events that occur during ischemia enhance KCl-induced release of cytochrome c in vitro (Fig. 1). Effect of Ischemia on Respiratory Activity of Mitochondria Isolated in Mannitol/Sucrose Homogenization Buffer—The occurrence of ischemia-induced alterations in state 3 respiratory rates were investigated in mitochondria isolated in mannitol/sucrose homogenization buffer. Despite the fact that ischemia did not result in a release of cytochrome c (Fig. 3), state 3 respiratory rates were markedly depressed in mitochondria isolated from ischemic relative to perfused tissue (Fig. 4). The relative decline in state 3 respiration was ∼30% irrespective of whether mitochondria were assayed in mannitol/sucrose-based (p ≤ 0.0007) or KCl-based (p ≤ 0.009) respiratory buffer. The addition of exogenous cytochrome c to mitochondria from perfused and ischemic myocardial tissue isolated and assayed in mannitol/sucrose buffers did not result in an increase in respiratory rates (not shown). This is in contrast to results shown in Fig. 2 indicating that mitochondria prepared in mannitol/sucrose buffer do not allow exit or entry of cytochrome c. Nevertheless, the decline in state 3 respiratory rates in mitochondria isolated in either KCl or mannitol/sucrose-based buffers indicates ischemia results in mitochondrial alterations that prevent cytochrome c from carrying out efficient electron transport and promote cytochrome c release in KCl buffers. Ischemia-induced Alterations in the Interaction(s) of Cytochrome c with the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane—Evidence indicates that mitochondrial cytochrome c can be associated with the inner membrane in both loosely and tightly bound states and can also be present as a soluble protein in the intermembrane space (15Ott M. Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 16Cortese J.D. Voglino A.L. Hackenbrock C.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6402-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These forms appear to exist in dynamic equilibrium, the relative distributions of which depend on factors such as ionic strength and redox status (15Ott M. Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 16Cortese J.D. Voglino A.L. Hackenbrock C.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6402-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, the observed ischemia-induced release of cytochrome c and decline in the rate of state 3 respiration could be due in part to ischemia-induced alterations in the associations of cytochrome c with the inner membrane followed by KCl-induced extrusion of labile cytochrome c from the mitochondria. To explore this possibility, mitochondria isolated in mannitol/sucrose-based homogenization buffer were subsequently diluted into KCl buffer, and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria was monitored. Consistent with results shown in Fig. 3, total mitochondrial cytochrome c content was unaltered by ischemia (Fig. 5). Following incubation in KCl buffer, mitochondria were centrifuged, and cytochrome c released from (supernatant) and retained within (pellet) the mitochondria was assessed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, KCl induced a significant release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. KCl-induced release was enhanced in mitochondria isolated from ischemic relative to perfused myocardial tissue (Fig. 5). As determined by densitometric analysis, 42.8 + 9.1 and 71.0 + 2.2% (p ≤ 0.004 for a two-tailed t test) of total cytochrome c was released from mitochondria isolated from hearts exposed to perfusion and ischemia, respectively. Thus, following treatment with KCl, mitochondria from ischemic myocardial tissue contain 50.7% of the cytochrome c content relative to perfused values (Fig. 5), in good agreement with the results presented in Fig. 1. No release was observed in mannitol/sucrose (not shown), indicating that these effects were not simply the result of mechanical disruption. Mitochondria isolated in KCl-based homogenization buffer subjected to the same experimental protocol failed to release any of the remaining cytochrome c (not shown). Thus, ischemia-induced alterations in the associations of cytochrome c with the inner mitochondrial membrane appear to be retained upon isolation, allowing for enhanced KCl-induced release from the mitochondria. To provide further support for decreased association of cytochrome c with the inner mitochondrial membrane during ischemia, mitochondria isolated in mannitol/sucrose buffer were incubated in hypotonic buffer and isolation buffer containing 0.025% Tween 20. These conditions are well known to favor the disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane and thus can be used to assess relative differences in the labile pools of cytochrome c. As shown in Fig. 6, mitochondria isolated from ischemic relative to perfused tissue exhibited enhanced release of cytochrome c upon exposure to either condition. As determined by densitometric analyses, the fraction of total cytochrome c released from mitochondria from perfused and ischemic hearts was 10.6 ± 3.2 and 23.5 ± 4.9%, respectively (p ≤ 0.001 for a two tailed t test, n = 3). These values are less than those observed upon incubation of mitochondria with KCl (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that ischemia induces both detachment of cytochrome c from the inner mitochondrial membrane and decreased strength of association. Clearly, ischemia promotes alterations in membrane and/or cytochrome c structure, thereby increasing the labile pool of cytochrome c (Figs. 5 and 6). Another potential mechanism by which cardiac ischemia enhances KCl-induced cytochrome c release is through the disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondria from perfused and ischemic hearts were therefore isolated in mannitol/sucrose-based homogenization buffers and subsequently fixed for electron microscopic analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 7, under all experimental conditions, mitochondria contain intact outer membranes and appear relatively intact. Thus, it is unlikely that gross structural alterations in the outer mitochondrial membrane are responsible for the ischemia-induced increase in KCl-dependent cytochrome c release. Nevertheless, the possibility exists that an increase in the fragility of the outer mitochondrial membrane during ischemia may contribute. Cytochrome c is an essential component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Located on the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c passes electrons between complexes III and IV. In this study, we provide evidence that ischemia-induced declines in the rate of mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis are due, at least in part, to decreased association of cytochrome c with the inner mitochondrial membrane. Inhibition of NADH-linked ADP-dependent respiratory rates resulting from ischemia was observed in mitochondria isolated in either KCl or mannitol/sucrose-based homogenization buffers. Enhanced release of cytochrome c and restoration of respiratory activity upon incubation with exogenous cytochrome c were evident in mitochondria isolated from ischemic cardiac tissue in KCl medium. Although ADP-dependent respiratory rates were depressed, cytochrome c release caused by ischemia was not observed when mitochondria were isolated in mannitol/sucrose buffer. Nevertheless, enhanced ischemia-dependent cytochrome c release was observed upon exposure of mannitol/sucrose mitochondrial preparations to KCl containing buffer, hypotonic solution, or detergent. These observations are consistent with the view that events that occur during ischemia result in decreased association of cytochrome c with the inner mitochondrial membrane, thereby slowing electron transport and eliciting declines in the rate of ADP-dependent mitochondrial respiration. Thus, ischemia increases the pool of cytochrome c available for release upon isolation or incubation of mitochondria in KCl medium. The results of this study have important implications for investigations into the mechanism(s) by which mitochondrial structure/function are altered during cardiac ischemia/reperfusion and the progression of other pathological conditions. Standard protocols for isolation of mitochondria utilize either KCl or mannitol/sucrose containing buffers. Although the composition of KCl medium typically reflects physiological K+ and ionic strength (17Cortese J.D. Voglino A.L. Hackenbrock C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Cortese J.D. Voglino A.L. Hackenbrock C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the use of this buffer could promote occurrences not directly related to experimental conditions. Moreover, certain structural properties may differ in mitochondria isolated in KCl versus mannitol/sucrose buffers, with further alterations possible upon evaluation of mitochondrial respiratory function in a variety of possible oxidative phosphorylation buffers. In particular, cytochrome c exit from and entry into the mitochondria appears dependent on factors related to medium composition through processes not clearly understood. The mechanisms currently under investigation include KCl-dependent insertion of certain Bcl-2 family proteins (e.g. Bax, Bak, Bad, and tBid) into the outer membrane and induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (13Doran E.

Clearly, translocation of cytochrome c is likely dependent on the presence of various components, many of which may be differentially retained under numerous isolation and assay conditions. For example, in earlier work utilizing an isolated buffer-perfused guinea pig heart model (3Piper H.M. Sezer O. Schleyer M. Schwartz P. Hutter J.F. Spieckermann P.G. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1985; 17: 885-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and an in vivo dog model of coronary occlusion (1Murfitt R.R. Stiles J.W. Powell Jr., W.J. Sanadi D.R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1978; 10: 109-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the addition of cytochrome c to mitochondria isolated from ischemic myocardial tissue resulted in variable restoration of mitochondrial respiration. Murfitt et al. (1Murfitt R.R. Stiles J.W. Powell Jr., W.J. Sanadi D.R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1978; 10: 109-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported that diminished rates of respiration were not abolished by cytochrome c addition, whereas Piper et al. (3Piper H.M. Sezer O. Schleyer M. Schwartz P. Hutter J.F. Spieckermann P.G. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1985; 17: 885-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) observed partial restoration of mitochondrial respiratory function. We found that at concentrations greater than optimum (14 nmol/mg mitochondrial protein), cytochrome c exerted inhibitory effects on state 3 respiratory rates (not shown). Thus, apparent discrepancies in the effects of cytochrome c are likely due to the concentrations utilized and/or the potential contribution(s) of a wide variety of other factors. Previous findings and information on the nature of the interaction of cytochrome c with the inner mitochondrial membrane suggest a plausible mechanism by which the associations of cytochrome c with the inner mitochondrial membrane are altered during cardiac ischemia. In numerous models of ischemia, cardiolipin content in the mitochondrial membrane has been shown to decrease (23Vasdev S.C. Biro G.P. Can. J. Biochem. 1980; 58: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Paradies G. Petrosillo G. Pistolese M. DiVenosa N. Serena D. Ruggiero F.M. Free Radical Biol.

Positively charged residues on the surface of cytochrome c complement negatively charged residues of electron transport chain proteins, thereby conferring specific interactions (18Cortese J.D. Voglino A.L. Hackenbrock C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Banci L. Bertini I. Rosato A. Varani G. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 824-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Similar electrostatic interactions are thought to anchor cytochrome c to cardiolipin within the membrane. Orrenius and co-workers (15Ott M. Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) have shown that peroxidation of cardiolipin is an efficient means for promoting cytochrome c detachment and can be used to distinguish between loosely and tightly bound forms of the protein. It is therefore likely that the loss of cardiolipin during ischemia results in a disruption of electrostatic interactions and an increase in the dissociable pool of cytochrome c. This would also explain the fact that the lability of cytochrome c and the deficit in state 3 respiratory rates were largely preserved when mitochondria were isolated in a low ionic strength mannitol/sucrose buffer. Isolation of mitochondria in high ionic strength buffer serves to enhance detachment even in control mitochondria but also, by mechanisms not fully understood, allows exit and entry of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Alterations in the subcellular distribution of cytochrome c can have profound effects on cellular viability. In addition to a decline in the rate of ATP synthesis, disruption of the interaction(s) of cytochrome c with the inner mitochondrial membrane would result in an increase in the ratio of reduced to oxidized components of the electron transport chain preceding complex IV. This would be expected to promote mitochondrial generation of oxygen radicals during reoxygenation. Interestingly, it has been recently shown that cytochrome c-depleted rat brain mitochondria produce elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (27Kushnareva Y. Murphy A.N. Andreyev A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Cardiac ischemia/reperfusion has also been associated with the induction and propagation of the apoptotic process (28Gottlieb R.A.

Cytochrome c can play a central role in this pathway. Once released into the cytosol, cytochrome c can form a complex with apoptotic-protease-activating factor-1 and pro-caspase 9. This results in caspase 9-dependent activation of caspase 3, nuclear DNA fragmentation, and cell death (21Martinou J.C. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Nat.

Increases in the labile pool of cytochrome c during cardiac ischemia are therefore likely to prime mitochondria for subsequent release of the protein in response to certain physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions. Potential mechanism(s) for reperfusion-induced cytochrome c extrusion from the mitochondria include the formation of cytochrome c-permeable pores derived from pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family such as Bax and/or induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (8Di Lisa F.

Clearly, events initiated during ischemia predispose the myocardium to detrimental effects of reperfusion. Decreased association of cytochrome c with the inner mitochondrial membrane is likely to be one such event. Future studies must address the consequences of this event during cardiac reperfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2070248941,"Previous studies suggested a role for calcium in CYP2E1-dependent toxicity. The possible role of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activation in this toxicity was investigated. HepG2 cells that overexpress CYP2E1 (E47 cells) exposed to arachidonic acid (AA) +Fe-NTA showed higher toxicity than control HepG2 cells not expressing CYP2E1 (C34 cells). This toxicity was inhibited by the PLA2 inhibitors aristolochic acid, quinacrine, and PTK. PLA2 activity assessed by release of preloaded [3H]AA after treatment with AA+Fe was higher in the CYP2E1 expressing HepG2 cells. This [3H]AA release was inhibited by PLA2 inhibitors, α-tocopherol, and by depleting Ca2+ from the cells (intracellular + extracellular sources), but not by removal of extracellular calcium alone. Toxicity was preceded by an increase in intracellular calcium caused by influx from the extracellular space, and this was prevented by PLA2 inhibitors. PLA2 inhibitors also blocked mitochondrial damage in the CYP2E1-expressing HepG2 cells exposed to AA+Fe. Ca2+ depletion and removal of extracellular calcium inhibited toxicity at early time periods, although a delayed toxicity was evident at later times in Ca2+-free medium. This later toxicity was also inhibited by PLA2 inhibitors. Analogous to PLA2 activity, Ca2+ depletion but not removal of extracellular calcium alone prevented the activation of calpain activity by AA+Fe. These results suggest that release of stored calcium by AA+Fe, induced by lipid peroxidation, can initially activate calpain and PLA2 activity, that PLA2 activation is critical for a subsequent increased influx of extracellular Ca2+, and that the combination of increased PLA2 and calpain activity, increased calcium and oxidative stress cause mitochondrial damage, that ultimately produces the rapid toxicity of AA+Fe in CYP2E1-expressing HepG2 cells. Previous studies suggested a role for calcium in CYP2E1-dependent toxicity. The possible role of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activation in this toxicity was investigated. HepG2 cells that overexpress CYP2E1 (E47 cells) exposed to arachidonic acid (AA) +Fe-NTA showed higher toxicity than control HepG2 cells not expressing CYP2E1 (C34 cells). This toxicity was inhibited by the PLA2 inhibitors aristolochic acid, quinacrine, and PTK. PLA2 activity assessed by release of preloaded [3H]AA after treatment with AA+Fe was higher in the CYP2E1 expressing HepG2 cells. This [3H]AA release was inhibited by PLA2 inhibitors, α-tocopherol, and by depleting Ca2+ from the cells (intracellular + extracellular sources), but not by removal of extracellular calcium alone. Toxicity was preceded by an increase in intracellular calcium caused by influx from the extracellular space, and this was prevented by PLA2 inhibitors. PLA2 inhibitors also blocked mitochondrial damage in the CYP2E1-expressing HepG2 cells exposed to AA+Fe. Ca2+ depletion and removal of extracellular calcium inhibited toxicity at early time periods, although a delayed toxicity was evident at later times in Ca2+-free medium. This later toxicity was also inhibited by PLA2 inhibitors. Analogous to PLA2 activity, Ca2+ depletion but not removal of extracellular calcium alone prevented the activation of calpain activity by AA+Fe. These results suggest that release of stored calcium by AA+Fe, induced by lipid peroxidation, can initially activate calpain and PLA2 activity, that PLA2 activation is critical for a subsequent increased influx of extracellular Ca2+, and that the combination of increased PLA2 and calpain activity, increased calcium and oxidative stress cause mitochondrial damage, that ultimately produces the rapid toxicity of AA+Fe in CYP2E1-expressing HepG2 cells.

The extracellular (secreted) PLA2s (sPLA2) require millimolar calcium concentrations for catalytic activity, and do not manifest significant fatty acid selectivity in vitro. In mammalian cells, as many as five different sPLA2 exist: groups I, IIA, IIC, V, and X. The intracellular PLA2s are further divided into groups IV (cytosolic Ca2+-dependent PLA2 or cPLA2) and VI (intracellular Ca2+ independent PLA2 or iPLA2) based on the Ca2+ requirements needed for basal activity. cPLA2 requires μm Ca2+ for membrane translocation but not for catalysis, and possesses a preference for phospholipids containing AA. iPLA2 exhibits no substrate specificity for AA-containing phospholipids and no Ca2+ requirement for activity. Coexpression of different forms of PLA2 has been found within the same cell or tissue (1Yang H.C. Mosior M. Johnson C.A. Chen Y. Dennis E.A. Anal.

Several studies have shown that reactive oxygen species in cellular systems can activate PLA2 activity, measured as increased release of radioactive AA in prelabeled cells (4Guidarelli A. Palomba L.

J. 1993; 293: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), all conditions associated with increased oxidant production, showed an increase in PLA2 activity. Phospholipase A2 activities of the mitochondrial and cytosolic fraction in the kidney were significantly enhanced after 1 h of ischemia followed by 1 h of reperfusion (15Terao Y. Shibata O. Goto S. Morooka H. Nakamura H. Haseba S. Sumikawa K. Res. Commun. Mol. Pathol. Toxicol. 1997; 96: 277-289PubMed Google Scholar). Liver microsomes isolated from rats chronically treated with ethanol showed increased PLA2 and CYP2E1 activity, decreased content of AA and increased content of conjugated dienes (16Nanji A.A.

Oxidative stress-associated activation of PLA2 has been proposed to be a critical factor in cytotoxicity. PLA2 activation results not only in the degradation of membrane phospholipids but also in the accumulation of unsaturated free fatty acids and lysophospholipids, which by themselves can be injurious (17Sapirstein A. Spech R.A. Witzgall R. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21505-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). On the contrary, PLA2 has been shown to be protective in some settings of lipid peroxidation and hypoxia/reoxygenation (18Zager R.A. Conrad D.S. Burkhart K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 2327-2339PubMed Google Scholar, 19Van Kujick F.J. Sevanian A. Handelman G.J. Dratz E.A. Trends Biochem.

There is mounting evidence that membrane lipid peroxidation stimulates phospholipid hydrolysis via Ca2+-dependent PLA2 activity. It is well known that Ca2+ mobilization and phospholipid degradation are closely interrelated. Membrane lipid peroxidation alters Ca2+ homeostasis, and this appears to be an important initial signal for PLA2 activity. Peroxides are known to increase intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations through either membrane disruption and physical disruption of ionic homeostasis, or by signaling release of intracellular calcium (22Suzuki Y.J. Forman H.J. Sevanian A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). In other cell systems, the mechanism of oxidant-induced AA release appears to be independent of Ca2+, resulting either from the activation of an iPLA2 (8Martinez J. Moreno J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 392: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Goligorky M.S. Morgan M.A. Lyubsky S. Gross R.W. Adams D.T. Spitz D.R. Arch. Biochem.

Physiol. 1998; 274: C1040-C1046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many cytochrome P450s especially CYP2E1 can produce superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide during their catalytic cycle (27Perret A.

Med. 1998; 24: 1324-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). CYP2E1 is of interest because of its ability to metabolize and activate many substrates to reactive intermediates and to its role in alcohol liver injury. CYP2E1 overexpression in HepG2 cells (E47 cell line), in the absence of added toxin, is associated with increased cellular production of ROS and lipid peroxidation (29Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30Mari M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and ethanol (33Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23914-23919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These cells when exposed to Fe-NTA showed an elevation of intracellular calcium and reactive oxygen species that occurs before the onset of cellular toxicity, events blocked by antioxidants. Control HepG2 cells not expressing P450 (C34 cells) showed very low toxicity and a small increase in intracellular calcium under the same conditions (34Caro A.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 104-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Activation of calpain was observed together with cell death, both processes blocked by calpain inhibitors (34Caro A.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 104-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An increase in intracellular calcium seems to be a very early and critical event in the toxicity caused by CYP2E1-dependent oxidative stress, leading to the activation of Ca2+-dependent processes such as calpain activity. The objectives of this work were: (i) to investigate the possible activation of PLA2 activity in HepG2 cells that overexpress CYP2E1, and exposed to a CYP2E1-dependent oxidative stress (Fe+AA), (ii) to evaluate the possible relationship between an increased PLA2 activity and cytotoxicity, and (iii) to study the Ca2+ dependence of the induction of PLA2 activity by CYP2E1-dependent oxidative stress. Chemicals—PBS and fatty acid free BSA were from Roche Applied Science. G418 was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Ethanol 95% was from Pharmaco Products (Brookfield, CT). Fluo3-AM and pluronic acid were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). [3H]AA was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protein concentration was measured using the BioRad DC Protein assay. Calpeptin was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Most other chemicals used were from Sigma Chemical Company. The iron·NTA complex (1:3 Fe/NTA) was prepared as previously described (32Sakurai K. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Culture and Treatment of Cells—Two human hepatoma HepG2 cell lines described in Ref. 29Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, were used as models in this study: E47 cells, which constitutively express human CYP2E1, and C34 cells, which are HepG2 cells transfected with the empty pCI vector. Both cell lines were grown in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mg/ml of G418 supplemented with 100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, in a humidified atmosphere in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were subcultured at a 1:5 ratio once a week. For the experiments, cells were plated at a density of 50,000 cells/ml and incubated for 12 h, in MEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (MEMexps). After this period, the medium was replaced with MEMexps supplemented with arachidonic acid (from 0 to 5 μm). For assays of PLA2 activity in situ, the medium was additionally supplemented with 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]AA (around 1 nm [3H]AA). After 12 h of incubation at 37 °C, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with PBS to remove unincorporated arachidonic acid. The cells were incubated for an additional 12-h period with MEMexps. Then, the cells were washed and the medium was replaced according to the experimental protocol in use. That medium was supplemented with any additions (e.g. antioxidants, inhibitors) for 1 h, prior to the addition of buffer or Fe-NTA (25 μm), which was considered as the initiation of the cellular toxicity phase (time, 0 h). The cells were incubated for variable periods (up to 12 h) before the biochemical analyses. This basic protocol, i.e. preloading with arachidonic acid, washing, adding the appropriate medium, and initiating the toxicity phase by addition of Fe-NTA, was used for all experiments. Measurement of PLA2 Activity in Situ—Phospholipase A2 activation was monitored in cultured cells using tritiated arachidonic acid as described in Briand et al. (35Briand S.I. Bernier S.G. Guillemette G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 105: 161-166PubMed Google Scholar). 50,000 cells were plated onto 24-well plates in MEMexps. Cells were first incubated with 2 μm AA and labeled with 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]AA, in MEMexps for 12 h. Cells were washed with PBS, and incubated with MEMexps for an additional 12-h period. After this, the cells were washed four times with PLA2 assay buffer: PBS pH 7.2 supplemented with 5.5 mm glucose, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 0.1% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, and 0 or 1 mm CaCl2. 500 μl of PLA2 assay buffer at 37 °C was added per well. Cells were put in a shallow water bath at 37 °C for 15 min, to allow equilibration of the cells. Then, where indicated, inhibitors were added, and the cells incubated for 1 h. After this time, buffer or Fe-NTA (25 μm) was added, and [3H]AA release was evaluated at several time points (0.5–3 h). To evaluate [3H]AA release, the medium containing the released [3H]AA was removed, placed in Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 2 min at 5000 rpm. The supernatant was transferred to scintillation vials, and the pellet containing detached cells was kept. The cells in each well were resuspended by adding 500 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100. The content of each well was transferred to the Eppendorf tubes containing the corresponding cellular pellet, and vortexed. Finally, the suspension was transferred to scintillation vials. 4 ml of scintillation fluid was added to each vial, and after vigorously shaking, the radioactive content was determined by scintillation counting using a β-counter. The data were expressed as percentage of cellular [3H]AA released: 100 × [3H]AA released/([3H]AA incorporated + [3H]AA released). 24 ± 4% of the initial [3H]AA was taken up by the cells. 86 ± 4% of the radioactivity taken up by the cells was esterified in phospholipids, and free AA represented only 0.4% of the total radioactivity incorporated in the cells. [3H]AA was found to account for 79 ± 6% of the total radioactivity recovered in the medium. Cell extraction was performed by the method of Folch et al. (36Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extract was washed two times with 0.5 ml of a rinse solution containing chloroform/methanol/water (3:48:47, by volume) (37Kim J.S. Southhard J.H. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1232-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The lipid phase (concentrated under N2 and redissolved in 15 μl of chloroform) was applied to a Silicagel 60 TLC plate and developed in petroleum ether/ethylic ether/methanol/acetic acid (80:20:2.5:1, by volume) to resolve radiolabeled AA and other lipids. The lipid zones were located with I2 vapor; they were then scraped into scintillation vials, and the radioactivity was measured after the addition of scintillation fluid. Identification of the lipids was based on a comparison of their TLC mobilities with those of authentic unlabelled standards (specifically R f = 0 for phospholipids, and R f = 0.43 for AA). Identification of the Location of Arachidonic Acid in Phospholipids— This control was performed following the protocol of Kim and Southard (37Kim J.S. Southhard J.H. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1232-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Lipids from cells labeled with [3H]AA were extracted, and the dried extract redissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 15 mm CaCl2 (pH 8.5). After 15 s sonication on ice, half of the sample was treated with 100 IU snake venom PLA2 and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The other half was also incubated for 1 h but in the absence of the enzyme. The reaction was terminated with 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, by volume), the lipids extracted and chromatographed on silica gel 60 TLC plates with petroleum ether/ethylic ether/methanol/acetic acid (80:20:2.5:1, by volume) to separate phospholipids (R f = 0) from AA (R f = 0.43). After exposure to iodine vapor, the spots were identified and scraped into vials containing 4 ml of scintillation fluid. In samples treated with PLA2, 99% of the radioactivity was located in the AA spot. This suggests that most of the arachidonic acid incorporated into phospholipids occupies the sn-2 position. Cytotoxicity Measurements—5 × 104 cells were plated onto 24-well plates and after the corresponding treatment, the medium was removed, and cell viability was evaluated by the MTT test (38Caro A.A. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 742-752PubMed Google Scholar) as previously described (39Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4357) Google Scholar). Another index of cytotoxicity used was the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (40Abe K. Matsuki N. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 38: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). LDH activity was assessed in a medium containing 50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 170 μm NADH, and 562 μm pyruvate. Cytotoxicity was expressed as % LDH release: (100 × (LDHout/LDHout + LDHin)). Measurement of Intracellular Calcium—The intracellular calcium levels were determined with the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo3-AM by flow cytometry. 5 × 105 cells were plated in 10-mm Petri dishes and at the end of the various treatments the medium was replaced with 3 ml of MEMexps without fetal bovine serum plus 2.5 μm fluo3-AM and 0.02% pluronic acid (stock solution x1000 in Me2SO). Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After loading, the cells were washed in PBS (to remove any dye non-specifically associated with the cell surface), trypsinized, and resuspended in 1 ml of MEMexps without fetal bovine serum plus 5 μg of propidium iodide. Propidium iodide was used to assay for the viable cell population as these cells exclude this dye, whereas non-viable cells take up this dye. The measurement of [Ca2+] i was performed by flow cytometry analysis of 5000 cells using Cell Quest software. Intracellular calcium level was evaluated as Fluo3 fluorescence intensity in propidium iodide negative (i.e. viable) cells (41Yang C.F. Shen H.M. Ong C.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 10 μm ionomycin was applied to one sample before each experiment to check for correct loading of the cells and thus served as a positive control. The inhibitors tested did not interfere with the quantification of the fluorescence (488/525 nm excitation/emission) of a standard fluo3-Ca2+ solution. Quinacrine itself presented high fluorescence at 488/525 excitation/emission, and therefore was not used in fluorescence measurements at these wavelengths. Lipid Peroxidation Assay—The production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) was assayed as previously described (38Caro A.A. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 742-752PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the cell suspension was determined using a protein assay kit based on the Lowry assay (BioRad DC kit). The concentration of MDA was calculated from a standard curve prepared using malonaldehyde bisdimethylacetal (42Esterbauer H. Cheeseman K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (2892) Google Scholar). Antioxidant Activity of Inhibitors—The possible antioxidant activity of phospholipase A2 inhibitors was evaluated following the protocol described in Rodriguez et al. (43Rodriguez R.J. Miranda C.L. Stevens J.F. Deinzer M.L. Buhler D.R. Food Chem. Toxicol. 2001; 39: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Microsomal membranes from control rat liver (250 μg protein/0.10 ml) were mixed with 0.5 μl of each drug (stock solutions × 200), and preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C in a reaction buffer consisting of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. Lipid peroxidation reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.05 mm FeCl3 chelated by 1 mm ADP and 0.4 mm NADPH. At various times of incubation, the levels of TBARS were determined as described above. The compounds tested did not interfere with the quantification of MDA in the standard curve at the concentrations employed. CYP2E1 Activity—CYP2E1 activity was measured in liver microsomes from acetone-treated rats (1% acetone v/v in the drinking H2O for 7–10 days), by the spectrophotometric analysis of p-nitrophenol hydroxylation as described in Dai et al. (44Dai Y. Rashba-Step J. Cederbaum A.I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6928-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The tested compounds did not interfere with the quantification of 4-nitrocatechol. Measurement of Calpain Activity in Situ—The activity of calpain in intact cells was assessed with the use of the cell permeable fluorogenic substrate SUCC-LLVY-AMC (45Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 144: 143-150PubMed Google Scholar) as previously described (34Caro A.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 104-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The tested compounds at the concentrations used did not interfere with the quantification of AMC fluorescence. Flow Cytometry Analysis of the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential— The mitochondrial transmembrane potential was analyzed from the accumulation of rhodamine 123, a membrane-permeable cationic fluorescent dye. Cells were plated onto 6-well plates, and at the end of the treatment the medium was replaced with fetal bovine serum-free MEMexps containing 5 μg/ml rhodamine 123, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then harvested by trypsinization, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of fetal bovine serum-free MEMexps. The intensity of fluorescence from rhodamine 123 was determined using a BD FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer (San Jose, CA) as previously described (38Caro A.A. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 742-752PubMed Google Scholar). Statistics—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. of the mean from 1 to 5 independent experiments run in duplicate. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with subsequent posthoc comparisons by Scheffe was performed. A p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. CYP2E1-dependent Toxicity and Protection by PLA2 Inhibitors—As previously described (38Caro A.A. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 742-752PubMed Google Scholar), addition of Fe+AA to CYP2E1-expressing HepG2 cells caused a rapid loss of cell viability (Fig. 1, A–E, 0 concentration of inhibitor). This mode of cell death was shown to be necrosis based upon assays of trypan blue uptake, release of lactic dehydrogenase and propidium iodide staining, and no DNA ladder formation (38Caro A.A. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 742-752PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of phospholipase A2 inhibitors on this toxicity of Fe+AA was tested. Aristolochic acid and quinacrine (two general non-specific PLA2 inhibitors) partially prevented the toxicity of Fe+AA in these cells, with optimal concentrations (maximal inhibition with lowest toxicity by itself) of 200 and 100 μm, respectively) (Fig, 1, A and B, respectively). PTK, a specific inhibitor of cPLA2 and iPLA2, also showed significant protection against the toxicity, with 20 μm optimal concentration (Fig. 1C). BPB (selective inhibitor of sPLA2) and BEL (selective inhibitor of iPLA2) did not show significant protection against the toxicity of Fe+AA (Fig. 1, D and E, respectively). Control HepG2 cells not expressing CYP2E1 did not show significant toxicity after exposure to Fe+AA and/or aristolochic acid (Fig. 1F), confirming the role of CYP2E1 in this Fe+AA toxicity model. CYP2E1-dependent Toxicity and Activation of PLA2—As several PLA2 inhibitors partially protected the CYP2E1-expressing HepG2 cells from the toxicity of Fe+AA, we evaluated the activation of PLA2 in this system, by measuring in situ the release of [3H]AA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were first loaded with 2 μm AA + 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]AA for 12 h and after several washing steps, the percentage of release of [3H]AA was measured at different time points after exposure to Fe-NTA. E47 cells treated with Fe+AA showed a time-dependent increased release of [3H]AA (denoting increased PLA2 activity) with respect to cells which were treated only with AA (Fig. 2A). The non CYP2E1-expressing cells also showed an increased release of [3H]AA especially after3hof exposure to Fe-NTA, but the release was lower than that measured in the cells expressing CYP2E1 (Fig. 2A). These results suggest an increased activation of PLA2 by AA+Fe in the CYP2E1-expressing cells. As a non-CYP2E1-dependent control, C34 and E47 cells were preloaded with 2 μm AA + 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]AA and then exposed to a calcium ionophore, A23187 (a potent PLA2 activator), for up to 3 h. Both cell lines showed comparable release of [3H]AA by the calcium ionophore at all time points evaluated (Fig. 2B). A23187-activated release of [3H]AA was partially blocked (41%) by 200 μm aristolochic acid (not shown). To evaluate simultaneously the kinetics of activation of PLA2 and the toxicity by Fe+AA, the release of [3H]AA and of LDH was measured in the same experimental sample, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” [3H]AA release and LDH release proceeded simultaneously, both reactions starting after 1.25 h of exposure of AA-loaded CYP2E1-expressing cells to Fe-NTA (Fig. 3).

In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms regulating the transcriptional regulation of rat Frp (rFrp) promoter. From previous findings, we know that the transcriptional activation domain of rFrp resides in the region -202 to -144 relative to the transcription start site, and that it is essential for efficient promoter activity. The study presented here was designed to identify trans-acting factors that bind to this critical domain of the rFrp promoter and to elucidate the pathway involved in the regulation of rFrp expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that specific DNA-protein binding activities fall into two adjacent core sequences with (CTTTGGGGG) at -197 to -189 and (AGATGATGTAA) at -151 to -141 of the rFrp promoter. Reporter assay showed that these core sequences are both required for the activation of rFrp promoter. Mutation within either one or both core sequence drastically reduced the promoter activity. Southwestern blotting showed that the estimated molecular mass of the distinct binding protein to the (AGATGATGTAA) domain is about 43 kDa. Further EMSA suggested CREB as the trans-acting factor in the DNA-protein complex, which was out competed by CREB consensus oligonucleotides and supershifted by anti-CREB antibody. Overexpression of PKA and CREB also transactivated rFrp promoter, and dominant-negative CREB inhibited the promoter activity in transient reporter assays. More importantly, CREB, phosphorylated CREB and the adaptor protein CBP were found binding to the endogenous rFrp promoter using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Collectively, our results demonstrate the induction of rFrp promoter activity by PKA and CREB in vitro, and the binding of CREB and CBP to the rFrp promoter core motif in vivo."
