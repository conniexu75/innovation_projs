https://openalex.org/W1508062978,"Abstract In order to render the carboxypeptidase from yeast more readily available for use in sequence studies in protein chemistry, the procedure of Hata, Hayashi, and associates for the preparation of the enzyme has been adapted to a larger scale through cooperation with the New England Enzyme Center. From 100 pounds of bakers' yeast, the yield was about 1.4 g of the chromatographically purified, electrophoretically homogeneous enzyme, free of other proteinase activity. The carboxypeptidase from the yeast of different manufacture has properties corresponding very closely to those observed initially by Hayashi and Hata; the glycoprotein has a molecular weight of about 61,000, has a nitrogen content of 12.74%, yields 15.1 g of hexose per 100 g, and consists of a single polypeptide chain of 442 residues with 16 residues of glucosamine in the carbohydrate moiety. Lysine is at the NH2 terminus and -Asp-Ser-Thr-Leu is the COOH-terminal sequence. The broad carboxypeptidase activity at pH 5, which includes the liberation of proline, has been tested with the present preparation on glucagon, the B chain of insulin, and reduced and carboxymethylated pancreatic ribonuclease. The amino acids in these sequences released most slowly were glycine and aspartic acid. The carboxypeptidase retains activity in 6 m urea and can be used for the study of proteins that may have inaccessible COOH termini in the usual aqueous solution; native pancreatic ribonuclease is one example."
https://openalex.org/W1578410723,"Abstract Lac repressor is characterized by the amino acid sequence of its first 59 amino acid residues and the sequence of additional peptides, accounting for a total of 104 residues, or about 30% of the molecule. Trypsin and chymotrypsin readily inactivate the DNA binding of repressor without a loss in binding properties for the inducer isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Characterization of the trypsinized repressor shows that digestion under native conditions yields a trypsin-resistant core molecule, which is still a tetramer and exhibits full inducer binding. The inducer binding activity as well as the tetrameric structure can be recovered after denaturation in a random coil solvent. The monomer molecular weight of the tryptic core is approximately 28,000, compared to 38,000 for the intact repressor polypeptide chain indicating the release of about 80 to 90 amino acid residues in the form of tryptic peptides. Characterization of these peptides indicates that they include the NH2-terminal 59 residues of the lac repressor and that they all probably come from the NH2-terminal region of the molecule. Thus, trypsin or chymotrypsin is able to attack the NH2-terminal regions of the repressor tetramer without inducing any further internal nicks in the polypeptide chain. These findings provide substantial support for the hypothesis that the NH2-terminal region of lac repressor is required for binding to the lac operator, but not for the binding of inducer or for the folding of the subunit and its association into a tetrameric structure."

https://openalex.org/W1487026581,"The biochemical properties and template specificity of the T7 phage-specific DNA-dependent RNA polymerase have been studied. The enzyme shows the same absolute requirements for DNA, nucleoside triphosphates, and a divalent metal ion as are found for bacterial RNA polymerases, however, the conditions for optimal RNA synthesis are somewhat different. The T7 RNA polymerase initiates T7 RNA chains rapidly with GTP; each enzyme molecule can initiate several T7 RNA chains in the course of the reaction. Hence, an efficient termination mechanism is present in the in vitro system. Of the helical DNAs tested, only T7 DNA, T3 DNA, and salmon sperm DNA have appreciable template activity with T7 RNA polymerase. A variety of single-stranded and denatured DNAs support RNA synthesis but at a reduced rate. Of the helical synthetic polynucleotides tested only d(I)n·d(C)n and d(G)n·d(C)n were active; both support the synthesis of poly[r(G)]. In contrast, both single-stranded poly[d(C)] and poly[d(T)] served as templates. It is suggested that T7 RNA polymerase requires a specific promoter site on DNA for effective transcription; this site is different from that used by bacterial RNA polymerase and may be rich in cytosine and thymidine residues."

https://openalex.org/W1581960990,"Catalase from bakers' yeast has been purified to homogeneity in the analytical ultracentrifuge and in gel electrophoresis; sedimentation measurements permit an estimation of its molecular weight as 248,000. Under denaturing conditions, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed dissociation of a major component of molecular weight 61,000, which constituted 90% of the total protein of the stained gel, suggesting that the native enzyme is tetrameric. The iron content was 0.096%, corresponding to a subunit molecular weight of 58,000. Specific activity was high (Kat. f. = 66,000); catalytic and spectroscopic properties were similar to those of catalases from other species. The enzyme is present in commercial yeast and in a variety of haploid and diploid wild type strains."
https://openalex.org/W1541953769,"Abstract Propylamine transferase, which catalyzes the biosynthesis of spermidine from 1,4-diaminobutane (putrescine) and decarboxylated adenosylmethionine, has been purified to homogeneity (approximately 2,000-fold) from Escherichia coli W. The enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 73,000 and is composed of 2 subunits of equal size. 1,5-Diaminopentane and spermidine can replace 1,4-diaminobutane as the propylamine acceptor, but the reaction takes place at a reduced rate."
https://openalex.org/W1541698544,"Abstract Biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase of Escherichia coli has been purified 1,500-fold. The purified enzyme showed two bands on disc gel electrophoresis, both carrying out the decarboxylation of l-arginine. Electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation was consistent with the enzyme being a tetramer of approximately 296,000 molecular weight. Titration of the apoenzyme with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate showed the binding of 1 molecule of cofactor per subunit. Biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase showed absolute requirements for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and magnesium ion for activity. The purified enzyme had a pH optimum of 8.4 and showed high specificity toward l-arginine as substrate. Both pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and arginine showed classical hyperbolic saturation kinetics with Michaelis constants of 0.6 µm for the former and 30 µm for the latter. The magnesium saturation curve, on the other hand, showed a sigmoidal relationship (S0.5 = 1.3 mm). The enzyme was feedback-inhibited by the polyamine end products, putrescine and spermidine. Analysis of kinetic studies showed that inhibition by putrescine was partially competitive with Mg2+ and partially competitive with arginine."

https://openalex.org/W1669746447,"Abstract A ribonucleolytic enzyme (RNase H) from Escherichia coli specific for RNA-DNA hybrids has been identified, partially purified, and characterized. RNase H specifically degrades the RNA strand of purified RNA-DNA hybrids but is inactive on single- or double-stranded RNA or on DNA. The mode of cleavage by RNase H is endonucleolytic, producing oligoribonucleotides with 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphate termini. Glycerol gradient density centrifugation indicates an s20,w of 3.3 and molecular weight of approximately 40,000 for the enzyme. RNase H is heat-labile, severely inhibited by (NH4)2SO4 above 0.1 m, and exhibits an absolute requirement for divalent cation for activity."

https://openalex.org/W1534456190,"Yeast phosphoglucose isomerase is shown to use and produce both the α and the β anomeric forms of fructofuranose 6-phosphate. Rapid quench techniques show a 20-fold preference in the utilization of the α anomer over the β anomeric form. The previous report that the α anomer of glucopyranose-6-P is the preferred substrate form is confirmed. However the β anomer is also shown to react at a slower rate. Studies using active site labeled phosphoglucose isomerase suggest that both anomers of each substrate react at the same enzyme site. A reaction mechanism consistent with these observations involves opening of both α and β ring forms to the corresponding acyclic forms followed by isomerization via an identical enzyme-bound cis-enediol. In order to accommodate both the α and the β anomers, torsion around C—C bonds is envisioned for the β anomers to arrive at the same cis-enediol intermediates."

https://openalex.org/W1527171874,"Abstract Tyrosine-sensitive 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate synthetase was prepared by a relatively simple procedure from an operator constitutive (tyrOc) strain of Salmonella typhimurium in highly purified, nearly homogeneous form. It had a molecular weight of approximately 100,000 and was independent of Co2+ for activity. In the reaction of d-erythrose 4-phosphate with enolpyruvate phosphate labeled with 18O in the C—O—P linkage, 18O was recovered almost entirely in orthophosphate released, indicating a C—O cleavage mechanism. The kinetic properties of the enzyme were studied by measuring release of 32Pi from [32P]enolpyruvate phosphate. With sufficiently low levels of substrates a sequential mechanism was indicated, rather than a ping-pong mechanism as previously reported from other laboratories. Rate equations were derived for bireactant mechanisms in which conversion of the ternary complex of enzyme and substrates to that of enzyme and products is irreversible. Expected inhibition patterns were deduced and used to analyze inhibition data. Product inhibition patterns by orthophosphate and 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate indicated an ordered reaction in which enolpyruvate phosphate was the first substrate to bind to enzyme and orthophosphate the first product to be released. A mechanism for the reaction is suggested which is in accord with these kinetic results, as well as orthophosphate release with C—O cleavage and stereospecific addition of erythrose 4-phosphate to enolpyruvate phosphate. The kinetics of inhibition of enzyme by d-erythritol 4-phosphate indicated that it was an apparent analog of 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate rather than of erythrose 4-phosphate."

Protection by a competitive inhibitor, saturation kinetics, and strict stoichiometry of alkylation indicate reaction at the active site only. The Vmax of inactivation shows a pH dependence similar to the catalytic Vmax, pK1 = 6.3, pK2 = 9.9. 1,2-Anhydro-l-iditol-6-P and 1,2-anhydro-d-glucitol-6-P also inactivate, possibly at the same residue, but at only 2% of the rate of the mannitol compound."
https://openalex.org/W1559708226,"Two classes of Escherichia coli unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs, which are complementary both in vivo and in vitro, have been utilized to study unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. β-Hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydrase, which catalyzes the first committed reaction in the unsaturated fatty acid synthetic pathway, is defective in one class, fab A. The defect in the second class, fab B, was unknown. The unsaturated fatty acid synthetic activity defective in fab B extracts was isolated from fab A extracts on the basis of an in vitro complementation assay. Throughout a 586-fold purification procedure the fab A unsaturated fatty acid synthetic activity was associated with β-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthetase, suggesting that the two activities are catalyzed by the same protein. Further support for this suggestion derived from the findings that both activities were purified together during the isolation of homogeneous β-ketoacyl-ACP synthetase from wild type E. coli B, both were inhibited to the same extent by iodoacetamide, both were protected against iodoacetamide inhibition by acetyl-ACP, and both were inactivated at 43° at identical rates. The fact that wild type β-ketoacyl-ACP synthetase stimulated unsaturated fatty acid synthesis by fab B extracts suggested that fab B β-ketoacyl-ACP synthetase is defective in unsaturated fatty acid synthetic activity. Although partially purified fab B β-ketoacyl-ACP synthetase was shown to be defective in unsaturated fatty acid synthetic activity, the mutant enzyme catalyzed normally condensation reactions involving fatty acyl-ACPs that are intermediates in the synthesis of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Although the unsaturated fatty acid synthetic activity of β-ketoacyl-ACP synthetase is not understood, these studies demonstrate that this enzyme catalyzes a unique reaction in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1594109027,"Abstract The homologous ribosomal systems from Escherichia coli and Clostridium pasteurianum were compared for their ability to translate f2 RNA, formaldehyde-treated f2 RNA, T4 early messenger RNA, E. coli messenger RNA, and C. pasteurianum messenger RNA in protein synthesis assays in vitro. The E. coli ribosomal system translated all five of these messengers, while the C. pasteurianum ribosomal system translated only the C. pasteurianum messenger RNA. The two ribosomal systems also had different characteristic magnesium profiles and exhibited different levels of endogenous activity in the protein synthesis assays. The messenger RNA responsible for the C. pasteurianum endogenous activity was shown to occur in the salt-washed ribosomes and not in the initiation factor fraction. The formaldehyde-treated f2 RNA and the C. pasteurianum messenger RNA exhibited different characteristics from the other types of messenger RNAs in their behavior with the E. coli ribosomal system in the protein synthesis assays. The two homologous ribosomal systems were also tested for their ability to bind [14C]formyl-Met-tRNA in response to different types of mRNA. The E. coli system bound fMet-tRNA in response to synthetic poly(A, G, U), f2 RNA, T4 early mRNA, and C. pasteurianum mRNA. The C. pasteurianum ribosomal system bound fMet-tRNA in response to poly(A, G, U) and C. pasteurianum mRNA but not f2 RNA or T4 early mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1511078819,"Abstract The role of guanosine triphosphate in the polypeptide elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu)-promoted binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes has been investigated. In the presence of EF-Tu and GTP, the binding of phenylalanyl-tRNA to the A site of the poly (U)-ribosome complex having an N-acetylphenylalanyl-tRNA prebound to its P site (Complex I) resulted in the formation of N-acetyldiphenylalanyl-tRNA. 5'-Guanylyl methylenediphosphonate (Gpp(CH2)p), a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, could substitute for GTP in promoting the binding of phenylalanyl-tRNA to ribosomes in the presence of stoichiometric amount of EF-Tu. However, very little dipeptide formation was observed under this condition. In contrast, when the complex formed with Gpp(CH2)p was incubated at 37° for 5 min and reisolated by centrifugation through 10% sucrose, approximately 50% of the bound radioactivity was recovered as N-acetyldiphenylalanine. This is presumably due to the detachment of Tu-Gpp(CH2)p from ribosomes during reisolation. It was concluded that the role of GTP hydrolysis in this reaction is to remove EF-Tu from ribosomes after the completion of the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA. The release of EF-Tu may be necessary to facilitate the peptidyl transfer and also to initiate the cyclic reutilization of EF-Tu."
https://openalex.org/W1578261346,"Phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase from Escherichia coli B cells grown with lactate as sole carbon source responds to variation in the adenylate energy charge (the mole fraction of ATP in the adenylate nucleotide pool plus one-half the mole fraction of ADP) in the manner characteristic of enzymes in biosynthetic sequences. This response is appropriate, since conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate is prerequisite to all biosynthetic sequences in lactate-grown cells. The response to energy charge is modulated by feedback inhibition by intermediates in various biosynthetic sequences: α-ketoglutarate, oxalacetate, phosphoenolpyruvate, 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde, and ADP-glucose. In conjunction with the previously demonstrated oppositely-directed response of pyruvate dehydrogenase to energy charge, these effects should assure the proper partitioning of pyruvate between biosynthesis (for which conversion to phosphoenolpyruvate is the first step) and oxidation with concomitant regeneration of ATP (for which conversion to acetyl coenzyme A is the first step)."
https://openalex.org/W1551116914,"In comparison with hen egg white lysozyme, goose lysozyme is known to be aberrant in both its structure and its enzymatic behavior in the presence of polymers of N-acetylglucosamine or cell suspensions of Micrococcus luteus. Our chemical studies show, however, that like the hen enzyme, goose lysozyme has muramidase activity. At several pH levels ranging from 3.5 to 7.1 the goose enzyme liberated the reducing ends of N-acetylmuramic acid residues in purified preparations of Escherichia coli and M. luteus peptidoglycans. In contrast to what is known about hen lysozyme, however, our results suggest that the goose enzyme has a distinct preference for N-acetylmuramic acid residues which are substituted with a peptide moiety. This difference in specificity towards the peptide portion of the peptidoglycan may be related to the biological function of lysozyme."
https://openalex.org/W1540686090,"Phosphomannose isomerase is highly specific for the β anomer of mannose 6-phosphate. The α anomer has no activity as a substrate and is, at best, a poor inhibitor. This specificity agrees with previous predictions based on stereo-chemical arguments. In addition, phosphomannose isomerase differs from phosphoglucose isomerase, which can also catalyze the function of anomerization of its substrates. Using the specificity of phosphomannose isomerase as a test system, it is shown that yeast phosphoglucose isomerase also catalyzes the conversion of α-mannose 6-P to β-mannose 6-P."
https://openalex.org/W1517755719,"Abstract Choline kinase was purified approximately 300-fold, in 5% yield, from an autolysate of dried brewers' yeast. A molecular weight of 67,000 was estimated using a Stokes radius of 33 A, as determined by Sephadex G-200 chromatography. An s20,w of 4.8 S was obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Enzyme activity was diminished by sulfhydryl inhibitors and stabilized by the presence of magnesium ion. The Michaelis constant for ATP was 1.4 x 10-4 m. The Michaelis constant with respect to choline was 1.5 x 10-5 m at low choline concentrations; reciprocal plots at high choline concentrations were non-linear. Initial velocity and product and dead-end inhibitor studies were performed on the forward reaction and were consistent with a Random Bi-Bi mechanism for catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1524568303,"Abstract Evidence based upon a variety of experimental approaches is in accord with the conclusion that native yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1, pyrophosphate phosphohydrolase) comprises two identical subunits approximately 32,000 in molecular weight with threonine and valine the NH2- and COOH-terminal residues, respectively. Gel filtration of reduced and carboxymethylated pyrophosphatase on a column of 6% agarose in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride revealed a single protein component of molecular weight 33,000; a value of 35,500 was obtained after exhaustive succinylation of the alkylated enzyme. The molecular weight thus derived for S-carboxymethylated pyrophosphatase was in close agreement with the values calculated from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and amino acid compositional data which were, respectively, 33,000 and 30,250. Threonine was identified as the sole NH2-terminal residue by the dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl chloride end group procedure. Hydrolysis of alkylated pyrophosphatase by carboxypeptidase A was attended by the rapid release of COOH-terminal valine in quantities stoichiometric with the amount of monomeric protein present. Peptide maps of trypsin digests from S-carboxymethylated enzyme revealed a total of 30 peptides, five of which gave a positive test for arginine and three of which stained positively for tryptophan. These results are in accord with what would be expected on the basis of the lysine, arginine, and tryptophan content of the enzyme subunit. Finally, the partial sequence of NH2-terminal amino acid residues presented below was elucidated by Edman degradation with the aid of automated sequencing equipment. [see PDF for sequence] Yields of the phenylthiohydantoin amino acid derivatives obtained after each cycle of the degradative procedure were consistent with the quantity of monomeric protein subjected to analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1555008911,"To determine whether small peptides could function as acceptors in the reaction catalyzed by arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase they were tested for their ability to inhibit the transfer of [14C]arginine from tRNA to bovine albumin and reaction mixtures containing them were examined by paper electrophoresis for the presence of new radioactive products. Among di- and tripeptides containing 17 different NH2-terminal residues only those with glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and, to a lesser extent, cystine were inhibitory. Inhibition was competitive with albumin and associated with the peptide-dependent formation of a new radioactive product. When Glu-Ala was used as inhibitor the product was isolated and identified as Arg-Glu-Ala. A marked variation in Ki values was observed for different di- and tripeptides containing appropriate NH2-terminal residues, suggesting that in addition to an NH2-terminal dicarboxylic amino acid other residues influence substrate specificity in this reaction. Certain non-peptide derivatives of the dicarboxylic acids were also found to serve as acceptors. Isoasparagine and isoglutamine were the best substrates among these compounds and acceptor specificity was related to the presence of a blocked α-carboxyl and an unsubstituted β- or γ-carboxyl group."
https://openalex.org/W1520423160,"Abstract The biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) component of Escherichia coli acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase has been previously isolated in multiple active forms, ranging in molecular weight from 45,000 to 9,100. Since the apparent native form of BCCP is the largest of these species, the isolation of the small forms was attributed to proteolysis during the purification procedures employed. We have now shown that native BCCP is very susceptible to subtilisin hydrolysis. Limited proteolysis of crude or purified preparations of native BCCP with subtilisin Carlsberg produces a mixture of BCCP species analogous to those previously noted. After more extensive proteolysis with subtilisin Carlsberg, all the intermediate forms are converted to a small form of BCCP, termed BCCP(sc), which we have isolated in milligram quantities and compared with BCCP(9100), the smallest form of BCCP previously isolated (mol wt 9100). Purified BCCP(sc) was found to be homogeneous by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels in the presence or absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, and in both gel systems it was indistinguishable from BCCP(9100), indicating the similarity in size and charge between the two proteins. From isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels, an isoelectric point of approximately 4.5 was determined for both BCCP(sc) and BCCP(9100). The amino acid composition of BCCP(sc) (80 amino acid residues, including 1 half-cystine residue) was identical with that of BCCP(9100), except that BCCP(9100) contains 2 additional alanine residues. The single sulfhydryl residue in either protein was titratable with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) only when denaturants such as 8 m urea or 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate were added. The biotin content of both proteins is consistent with the presence of 1 biotin residue per molecule. BCCP(sc) was active as a carboxyl acceptor and donor in the biotin carboxylase and transcarboxylase reactions of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. In each of these reactions a Km of approximately 3 x 10-5 m was determined for BCCP(sc), compared with a value of 2.5 x 10-5 m for BCCP(9100). Vmax values for the two proteins in these reactions were essentially identical. When BCCP(10400) (96 amino acid residues; mol wt 10400), previously isolated along with BCCP(9100) from a mixture of small BCCP species, was treated with subtilisin Carlsberg, it was quantitatively hydrolyzed to a species of BCCP identical with BCCP(sc). BCCP(sc) and BCCP(9100) are resistant to further proteolysis at 37° and pH 8 by high concentrations of subtilisin as well as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and thermolysin, lending support to the idea that these small forms represent a stable core peptide in native BCCP. Efforts to isolate the peptide fragment lacking biotin from subtilisin-treated BCCP have been unsuccessful, suggesting that it is rapidly degraded by subtilisin."
https://openalex.org/W1505132182,"Urea carboxylase, an avidin-sensitive enzyme catalyzing the ATP-dependent carboxylation of urea, has been shown to catalyze this reaction in a sequence of at least two steps. In the presence of all of the required carboxylation cofactors except urea, an enzyme-CO2 complex is formed. This complex was isolated by Sephadex chromatography and was capable, in the absence of added cofactors, of transferring the bound CO2 to urea. In addition to the carboxylation of urea this protein was capable of carboxylating free d-biotin, as well as the urea analogues formamide, formylurea, and acetamide. These data are consistent with the suggestion that urea carboxylase follows a reaction mechanism similar to those of the more thoroughly studied propionyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, and pyruvate carboxylases."

https://openalex.org/W1575372103,"Abstract Biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase of Escherichia coli undergoes reversible association and dissociation dependent on the buffer conditions. The apoenzyme underwent dissociation which was pH-dependent, with apparent molecular weights of 140,000 at pH 6 and 80,000 at pH 8. At pH 8, in the presence of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate alone, the enzyme remained fully dissociated, while magnesium ion by itself induced association of the enzyme to a form which was indistinguishable from the tetrameric holoenzyme (molecular weight 275,000 to 300,000). The negative effector, putrescine, caused the formation of more rapidly sedimenting species, but somewhat less efficiently than magnesium ion. In the presence of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, putrescine much more efficiently induced the formation of tetramer. At pH 8, but not at pH 6, magnesium ion was required for the formation of an adduct between pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and arginine decarboxylase which, on the basis of its spectral properties, was interpreted to a Schiff base. At pH 6, the Mg2+ requirement for enzymatic activity was not as stringent as at higher pH values. The requirement of Mg2+ for both Schiff base formation and formation of tetramer was proposed to be directly related to the requirement of this metal ion for the catalytic activity of this enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2017305140,"SYNTHETIC organochlorine derivatives have been found in a variety of seabirds from the eastern North Pacific1 and even the Antarctic2, and considerable amounts of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in particular have been found in birds from the Baltic3, Dutch waters4 and the livers of starving common guillemots, Uria aalge, washed ashore around the Irish Sea in the autumn of 19695. But comparatively few estimates of the amounts present in normal seabirds from the open North Atlantic have yet been published. We are reporting elsewhere6 the results of the investigation of over 100 birds from a representative range of species occurring between Scotland and the Arctic. In general they were all found to contain mainly PCBs and pp′-DDE, the former in greater concentration in every bird examined, in marked contrast to the North Pacific, where DDE levels are normally higher1. The ratio of PCB to DDE was usually between two and ten in all species with the exception of the kittiwake, Rissa tridactyla, where the ratio was always higher. It is difficult to measure DDE in the presence of relatively high amounts of PCBs but in some of the kittiwakes this ratio was at least 60. This suggests that kittiwakes have a food source relatively high in PCBs compared with the other species or, less likely, that they metabolize or excrete DDE more rapidly than the other species."

Lett. 18, 6; Sedlacek, J., Jonak, J., and Rychlik, I. (1971) Biochem. Biophys. Acta 254, 478) that l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) inhibits the EF-T-mediated binding of phenylalanyl-tRNA to the ribosome and have extended this observation by demonstrating that TPCK, but not its lysine analogue, irreversibly destroys the ability of EF-Tu·GTP to form the ternary complex with phenylalanyl-tRNA which is a known intermediate in its transfer to the ribosome. The prior formation of this ternary complex protects EF-Tu from TPCK inactivation. The present evidence is consistent with the view that TPCK inactivates EF-Tu by specifically reacting with some portion of the site of phenylalanyl-tRNA binding."

https://openalex.org/W1489835097,"Abstract Elongation of palmityl-CoA to longer chain fatty acids by the high molecular weight fatty acid synthetase from Mycobacterium phlei requires a factor present in boiled mycobacterial extracts in addition to and distinct from the polysaccharides (3 - O - methylmannose - containing polysaccharide (MMP) or lipopolysaccharide that contains 6-O-methylglucose and glucose (MGLP)) which support the de novo synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA in this system. This elongation factor (EF) has been purified 46-fold and is shown to be a protein with a molecular weight of about 10,500. EF catalyzes the hydrolysis of long chain acyl-CoA derivatives and the following evidence indicates that it functions as a thioesterase in palmityl-CoA elongation. (a) Elongation and thioesterase activities show parallel chain-length specificities for acyl thioesters from C10 to C18. (b) The two activities are inactivated at similar rates on heating at 50°. (c) Elongation and thioesterase activities migrate the same distance on gel electrophoresis at pH 8.5. (d) Thioesterase I from Escherichia coli can replace EF in stimulating palmityl-CoA elongation by the Mycobacterium phlei fatty acid synthetase. (e) Free coenzyme A, in adequate concentrations, stimulates palmityl-CoA elongation as effectively as EF. It is concluded that EF, by virtue of its thioesterase activity, adjusts intracellular concentrations of palmityl-CoA and free CoA to levels which are favorable for chain elongation. The regulatory significance of thioesterase activities is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1596343500,"Abstract A number of analogues of Escherichia coli apo-acyl carrier protein (apo-ACP) have been synthesized by the solid phase method. A standard isolation procedure was used for all analogues. This involved cleavage from the solid support and deprotection by treatment of the peptide-resin with hydrogen bromide and trifluoroacetic acid. The product was then purified by gel filtration. When necessary the deprotection of Ne-nitroarginine was achieved by hydrogenation. The prosthetic group, 4'-phosphopantetheine, was introduced enzymatically with holo-ACP synthetase, and the holoprotein was purified by ion exchange chromatography. The product was then assayed for biological activity with the enzymes malonyl coenzyme A-ACP transacylase and β-ketoacyl-ACP synthetase and with antiserum prepared against native ACP. The following analogues were synthesized: [Arg(NO2)6]-apo-ACP-(1-74); apo-ACP-(2-74); apo-ACP-(3-74); [Arg(NO2)6,Nle8, 9, 18]-apo-ACP-(1-74); [Arg(NO2)6,Nle44]-apo-ACP-(1-74); [Nle6, 44]-apo-ACP-(1-74); [Arg(NO2)6, Nle8, 9, 18, 44]-apo-ACP-(1-74); [Arg(NO2)6,Nle8, 9, 18, 44]-apo-ACP-(2-74); [Arg(NO2)6,Nle8, 9, 18, 44]-apo-ACP-(3-74); [Arg(NO2)6,Nle8, 9, 18, 44]-apo-ACP-(4-74); [Arg(NO2)6, Nle8, 9, 18, 44]-apo-ACP-(5-74); [Arg(NO2)6,Nle8, 9, 18, 44]-apo-ACP-(6-74); [Nle8, 9, 18, 44]-apo-ACP-(7-74); and [Arg(NO2)6, Nle8, 9, 18, 44]-apo-ACP-(1-61). A study of the activity of these derivatives indicated that the single methionine at position 44 and the three lysines at positions 8, 9, and 18 play a nonessential role in the biological function of ACP. The single arginine at position 6 is more critical, for although the Ne-nitroarginine derivative was active, substitution of norleucine for arginine gave an analogue which was inactive with malonyl-CoA-ACP transacylase. While a large part of the COOH terminus was not essential, since the fragment 1 through 61 retained significant activity, the NH2 terminus was much more critical and the omission of more than 3 residues caused a significant reduction in the biological activity of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1588380213,"Abstract The incorporation of uracil into DNA in an in vitro repair reaction catalyzed by native Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I renders the newly synthesized uracil-containing portion of the resultant polymer susceptible to an endonucleolytic-like cleavage by the polymerase itself. This response is related to the presence of the 5' → 3' nuclease activity of this enzyme, since subtilisin-treated polymerase which lacks this nuclease activity also fails to attack uracil-containing DNA in this way."
https://openalex.org/W1602563532,"The separation, composition, and amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides of the tryptophan synthetase α chain of Aerobacter aerogenes are described. The probable over-all sequence is compared with that of Escherichia coli; there are 39 residue differences between the two polypeptides. The amino acid sequence of the A. aerogenes α chain is 1 residue longer at the COOH terminus than those of E. coli and S. typhimurium. The phylogenetic implication of residue differences among these three α chains is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1527392513,"The methylation of Escherichia coli B transfer RNA in vitro by HeLa mitochondrial and cytoplasmic extracts was examined. The following differences were found. (a) The cytoplasmic extract methylated E. coli B tRNA to a much greater extent than did the mitochondrial extract. (b) The two extracts methylated different sites on E. coli B tRNA, thereby generating different methylated oligonucleotide sequences. (c) The methylated base composition of E. coli B tRNA methylated in vitro indicated that 2-methyladenine tRNA methylase activity was uniquely associated with the mitochondria, while N2-dimethylguanine tRNA methylase activity was uniquely associated with the cytoplasm. The presence of 2-methyladenine tRNA methylase activity in HeLa mitochondria and its absence in HeLa cytoplasm was taken as evidence for the existence of at least one mitochondrial-specific methylase. In addition, since 2-methyladenine is commonly found in prokaryote tRNA but not in eukaryote cytoplasmic tRNA, it was suggested that the presence of 2-methyladenine tRNA methylase activity in mitochondria was evidence that mitochondria might have evolved from prokaryote cells."

https://openalex.org/W1480547408,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase (PEP synthetase) and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, both partially purified from lactate-grown Escherichia coli B, were assayed simultaneously in the same reaction mixture to evaluate some of the factors that must affect the partition of pyruvate between degradation and biosynthesis in vivo. The enzymes responded independently to control parameters; thus, under assay conditions in vitro there were no protein-protein interactions that affected the kinetic properties of the enzymes. When equal activities of the enzymes were present in the absence of modifiers, the two reactions proceeded at equal velocities (corresponding to equipartition of pyruvate between degradation and biosynthesis) at an energy charge value of about 0.85. At higher values of charge, conversion to PEP (which would lead in vivo to biosynthesis) predominates, and at lower values of charge the partition favors conversion to acetyl coenzyme A (which would lead in vivo to degradation of substrate and regeneration of ATP). Inhibitors of PEP synthetase (PEP, oxalacetate, and α-ketoglutarate) alter the partition ratios, increasing the fraction converted to acetyl coenzyme A at all values of energy charge. Acetyl coenzyme A, which inhibits the first enzyme of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, has the opposite effect on the partition ratio. In cultures growing on glucose, PEP synthetase has no apparent function, and the ratio of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity to that of PEP synthetase was between 10 and 20 in such cultures. In lactate-grown cultures this ratio was as high as 4 at early stages, but fell to 0.5 during growth. These variations in relative enzyme levels, together with the responses to adenylate energy charge and feedback inhibition reported here, seem well adapted for controlling the partitioning of pyruvate between degradation and biosynthesis as appropriate to the momentary metabolic needs of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1520512042,"Abstract A total of 82 peptides has been isolated from a peptic digest of bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase. Partial and complete sequence determinations have been performed on most of these to confirm their position in the polypeptide chain, to complete portions of the sequence not determined in previous studies, and to provide overlaps for the tryptic and cyanogen bromide peptides. All of the 82 peptic peptides could be accommodated by the amino acid sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1515965518,"Abstract Large Cotton effects associated with the π → π* and n → π* transitions of asparaginase substrates have been shown in substrates containing a 2nd asymmetrical carbon atom at the β position, diaminosuccinic acid monoamide and β-methylasparagine. Hydrolysis of the amide bond is accompanied by large changes in the rotatory strength of these transitions. These substrates have four possible isomers, l-l, d-d, l-d, and d-l. From the signs of the Cotton effects appearing on hydrolysis of mixtures of these isomers it can be determined which isomer is hydrolyzed. The enzyme has an almost absolute stereospecificity for the l-d isomer which defines the three-dimensional arrangement of the protein groups interacting with the substituents on the α carbon and the catalytic groups adjacent to the β-amide within rather narrow limits. While the l-l isomer of diaminosuccinic acid monoamide is not detectably hydrolyzed, the l-l isomer of β-methylasparagine is attacked at a rate 0.2 to 0.3% of that observed for l-asparagine, suggesting that a β-CH3 group can be accommodated in this configuration while a β-NH2 cannot."
https://openalex.org/W1985953492,Regnier and Park1 do not appear fully to have appreciated the significant point that emerged from my finding2 that much higher concentrations of antibiotic-resistant and sensitive coliform organisms were present in specimens of water taken from rivers flowing through urban areas than were present in similar specimens taken from rivers flowing through rural areas. This is that human beings were the main source of the sewage pollution of the rivers and that domestic animals were a comparatively unimportant source. The fact that one cannot differentiate the two kinds of specimens from each other by reference to the ratio of the numbers of resistant and sensitive organisms they contain is therefore irrelevant.
