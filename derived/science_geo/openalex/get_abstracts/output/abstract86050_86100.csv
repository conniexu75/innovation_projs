https://openalex.org/W2058276948,"Ardrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), beta-endorphin and the melanotropins (MSHs) are all derived from a single large precursor molecule, proopiomelanocortin (POMC) by individual processing through a series of co- and post-translational modifications. Although the primary site of synthesis is in the pituitary, POMC-derived peptides have been identified in various tissues, notably the brain (see refs 6, 7 for review). A major question concerning brain POMC is whether it is synthesized within the central nervous system (CNS) itself or whether it is taken up from plasma flowing in a retrograde fashion from the pituitary. POMC peptides have been detected immunohistochemically and biochemically in the medial basal hypothalamus, the amygdala and throughout the brain stem. POMC peptide-containing cell bodies have been identified only in two cell groups, however, principally in the periarcuate region of the hypothalamus and to a lesser extent in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius. These and other observations have suggested that POMC peptides are synthesized locally in the medial basal hypothalamus and reach other regions of the CNS by axonal transport. Civelli et al. identified POMC mRNAs in nucleic acid extracts of rat and bovine hypothalami by solution hybridization as well as Northern gel blot analysis, but because of the close proximity of the hypothalamus to the pituitary and the extremely low amounts of POMC mRNA being measured in the hypothalamus, the possibility of tissue contamination during dissection could not be ruled out. We report here the anatomical co-localization of POMC-related peptides and POMC-specific mRNAs to a single major cell group in the medial basal hypothalamus. The presence of POMC-specific mRNA in a POMC peptide-containing cell in the brain is strong support for POMC biosynthesis within brain tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1554272825,"Pertussis toxin, the major toxin produced by Bordetella pertussis, catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of a specific membrane polypeptide which appears to be involved in regulation of the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase. In the current study, a rapid purification procedure has been developed for the preparation of pertussis toxin in high yields. Through the sequential use of the affinity matrices Affi-Gel blue and fetuin-Sepharose 4B, milligram quantities of apparently homogeneous toxin can be prepared from the culture supernatants of B. pertussis strain 165. Structural, amino acid, and immunologic analyses indicate that toxin prepared from strain 165 is indistinguishable from toxin prepared from other strains. Activation of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity requires treatment of the toxin with a thiol reducing agent. This activation appears to be associated with the reduction of intrachain disulfide bonds present in the catalytic subunit. Activated toxin preparations catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of a protein (Mr = 40,000) present in cell membrane preparations obtained from human red blood cells and platelets, rat adipocytes, and cyc- S49 cells which are deficient in the adenylate cyclase regulatory component which is the substrate for cholera toxin."

https://openalex.org/W1546095443,"Gene 4 protein of bacteriophage T7 is a multifunctional enzyme that both stimulates T7 DNA polymerase during leading strand synthesis, and synthesizes RNA primers that initiate lagging strand synthesis. Both activities are dependent on the ability of the gene 4 protein to translocate unidirectionally (5' to 3') along single-stranded DNA (Tabor, S., and Richardson, C.C. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 205-209), a reaction that is coupled to the hydrolysis of nucleoside 5'-triphosphates. In this paper, we show that gene 4 protein, in the absence of other proteins, is a helicase, an activity previously inferred from its ability to stimulate T7 DNA polymerase on duplex DNA. We have designed a DNA substrate for use in characterizing the helicase activity which consists of a short DNA fragment bearing a single-stranded 3'-tail when annealed to circular, single-stranded M13 DNA. With such a DNA substrate, the gene 4 protein can disrupt the helical structure of a 96-nucleotide-long fragment, resulting in its displacement from the circle. Helicase activity requires a long stretch of at least 17 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA on the 5'-side of the duplex to be unwound. In addition, helicase activity is not observed unless a short (greater than 6 nucleotides) single-stranded 3'-tail is present. The helicase activity has an absolute requirement for hydrolysis of a nucleoside 5'-triphosphate. The inhibitor of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis, beta, gamma-methylene dTTP, is an effective inhibitor of helicase activity. Based on these results, we propose a model for the action of the gene 4 protein at a replication fork."
https://openalex.org/W1544945960,"Abstract Using a newly developed method for microfilament isolation (Matsumura, F., Yamashiro-Matsumura, S. and Lin, J. J.-C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6636-6644), we have analyzed protein composition of microfilaments in and transformed rat tissue culture cells. They include REF-52 (an established rat embryo cell line) cells, REF-52 transformed by DNA viruses (SV40 or adenovirus type 5), normal rat kidney cells, and normal rat kidney cells transformed by RNA viruses (Kirsten or Rous sarcoma virus). Microfilaments from normal rat culture cells contain three major tropomyosins (apparent Mr = 40,000, 36,500, and 32,400) and two relatively minor tropomyosins (apparent Mr = 35,000 and 32,000). In transformed cells the levels of one or two of the major tropomyosins (Mr = 40,000 and 36,500) are decreased and the levels of one or both of the minor tropomyosins (Mr = 35,000 and 32,000) are increased. These changes in tropomyosin patterns were also observed in temperature shift experiments with rat-1 cells transformed with a Rous sarcoma virus mutant, temperature-sensitive for transformation. Cell-free translation of whole cell mRNA generated similar tropomyosin patterns on two-dimensional gels, suggesting that changes in the pattern of tropomyosin expression were largely effected at the level of RNA rather than by post-translational modification. Such changes in the tropomyosin composition of microfilaments were consistently found to accompany the various morphological alterations associated with transformation. We suggest that alterations in the pattern of tropomyosin expression are involved in, or cause, rearrangement of stress fibers and that this may be responsible (in part) for morphological transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1493514243,"Abstract Incubation of 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells with 1 microM isoproterenol rapidly results in the conversion of a portion of the beta-adrenergic receptors to a membrane form that can be separated from markers for the plasma membrane by sucrose density gradient or differential centrifugation. This form of the receptor reaches a maximal level within 10 min of incubation of cells with catecholamine. Two types of experiments suggest that the early phase of catecholamine-induced desensitization of the beta-adrenergic receptor-linked adenylate cyclase can be separated into at least two reactions. First, the agonist-induced loss of catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity precedes the appearance of beta-adrenergic receptors in the light peak fraction by 1-2 min. Second, pretreatment of cells with concanavalin A prior to induction of desensitization blocks the formation of the light peak form of beta-adrenergic receptors without blocking the reaction as measured by catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Specificity for the reaction that converts beta-adrenergic receptors to the light peak form is indicated by the lack of a catecholamine-induced alteration in the sucrose density gradient distribution of muscarinic cholinergic receptors, adenylate cyclase or the guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, Ns and Ni. The light peak of beta-adrenergic receptors migrates at a density similar to that of at least a portion of the activity of galactosyltransferase, a marker for Golgi. Enzyme marker activities for lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum are not associated with this population of beta-adrenergic receptors. Taken together, these and other data suggest that incubation of 1321N1 cells with isoproterenol results in a rapid uncoupling of beta-adrenergic receptors from adenylate cyclase which is followed by a change in the membrane form of the receptor. This latter step most likely represents internalization of receptors into a vesicular form which may then serve as the precursor state from which receptors are eventually lost from the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1526334397,"We have studied transcriptional initiation in the mitochondria of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by analyzing mitochondrial transcripts from grande and petite yeast after labeling in vitro with vaccinia virus guanylyltransferase and [alpha-32P]GTP. This procedure labels triphosphate-terminated RNA which arises from transcriptional initiation. Exploiting the extremely low GC content (18%) of yeast mitochondrial DNA, we digested the in vitro capped transcripts with the G-specific ribonuclease T1; this resulted in 27 oligonucleotides varying in size from 2 to 51 nucleotides. RNA from 14 overlapping petites was analyzed and 20 transcripts were localized by deletion mapping. Nineteen oligonucleotides were sequences and 13 were identified and precisely localized by comparison with known DNA sequences. In all cases, transcription is initiated at a consensus nonanucleotide sequence which can be considered part of the yeast mitochondrial promoter. We identified initiation sites for the 21 S and 14 S rRNAs; the phenylalanine, f-methionine, and glutamic tRNAs; two sites for the OLI-1 gene; and three for the ori (rep) regions. Most promoters appear to give rise to very long multigene primary transcripts. Examples are multigene transcripts for the glutamic tRNA and COB genes and for the OLI-1, serine tRNA, and Var genes. Since the consensus nonanucleotide sequences at the ori regions are similar to those at other transcriptional initiation sites, it is likely that the same RNA polymerase primes DNA replication and gene transcription."

https://openalex.org/W1576136913,"The incorporation of methionine, lysine, and leucine into protein was studied in Ca2+-depleted and Ca2+-restored preparations of C-6 glial tumor cells in minimal medium. Although incorporation proceeded at linear rates in both preparations for more than 1 h and into the same spectrum of proteins, Ca2+-restored cells incorporated amino acid 5- to 10-fold more rapidly than Ca2+-depleted cells. Addition of approximately 200 microM Ca2+ in excess of chelator was required to achieve maximal rates of incorporation in Ca2+-depleted preparations. Stimulation by Ca2+ was rapid in onset (several minutes) and slowly reversible by chelator. Ca2+ was uniquely potent and specific among physiologically occurring cations in conferring such stimulation. Stimulation of amino acid incorporation by Ca2+ occurred over a broad range of pH and osmolarities and was facilitated by Mg2+. The effects of Ca2+ in stimulating amino acid incorporation were not traceable to changes in cAMP metabolism, amino acid uptake, protein catabolism, cell ATP or GTP content, or aminoacylation of transfer RNA. Actinomycin D (1 microgram/ml) did not block the stimulatory effects of Ca2+ although puromycin and cycloheximide did. The stimulatory effects of Ca2+ on protein synthesis were not restricted to C-6 in minimal medium. Protein synthesis was reduced by ethylene glycol bis(B-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid 40 to 75% in C-6 glioma, GH3 pituitary tumor, PC-12 adrenal tumor, N2A neuroblastoma, and HeLa cells incubated under simulated growth conditions with various enriched media and sera. Ca2+-depleted S49 lymphoma, CHO ovarian tumor, and normal, dispersed chicken embryo cells in enriched medium responded to Ca2+ restoration with increased rates of protein synthesis as did collagenase-dispersed normal rat liver cells in minimal medium. Protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysates was also inhibited by Ca2+-selective chelators or by Ca2+ removal by parvalbumin affinity chromatography and the inhibition was reversed by Ca2+. These findings are consistent with the existence of a Ca2+ requirement in the translational phase of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1567244144,"Abstract The free energy of the binding reaction between EcoRI restriction endonuclease and a specific cognate dodecadeoxynucleotide (d(CGCGAATTCGCG)) has contributions from both electrostatic and nonelectrostatic components. These contributions were dissected by measuring the effects of varying salt concentration on the equilibrium binding constant and applying the thermodynamic analyses of Record et al. (Record, M. T., Jr., Lohman, T. M., and deHaseth, P. L. (1976) J. Mol. Biol. 107, 145-158). Endonuclease mutation S187 (Arg 187 to Ser) (Greene, P. J., Gupta, M., Boyer, H. W., Brown, W. E., and Rosenberg, J. M. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 2143-2153) did not significantly affect the nonelectrostatic component but did perturb the electrostatic contribution to the binding energy (we are numbering the amino acid residues according to the DNA sequence). The former was determined by extrapolating the linear portion of the salt dependence curve (0.125 to 0.25 M KCl) to 1 M ionic strength, with the same result for both wild type and S187 endonucleases at both pH 6.0 and 7.4 (-8.5 +/- 1.5 kcal/mol or greater than 50% of the total binding free energy). The slopes of these same curves yield estimates of eight ionic interactions between wild type endonuclease and the DNA at both pH values. By contrast, binding of EcoRI-S187 to dodecanucleotide involves six charge-charge interactions at pH 6.0. Only two ionic interactions are observed at pH 7.4. This was unexpected since gel permeation chromatography demonstrated that the recognition complex for both wild type and S187 proteins contains an enzyme dimer and a DNA duplex. EcoRI-S187 endonuclease retains wild type DNA sequence specificity, and the rate of the phosphodiester hydrolysis step is also unchanged. Thus, electrostatic interactions are functionally separable from sequence recognition and strand cleavage. Our results also establish that arginine 187 plays a key role in the electrostatic function and suggest that it might be located at the DNA-protein interface. The disproportionate loss of ion pairs at pH 7.4 can be rationalized by a model which suggests that six conformationally mobile ionic groups on the protein act in a coordinated manner during the interaction with DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1515122089,"Pink (reduced) uteroferrin exhibits well resolved paramagnetic NMR spectra with resonances ranging from 90 ppm downfield to 70 ppm upfield. The intensities of these signals depend on the degree of reduction and correlate well with the intensity of the EPR signals with gave = 1.74. Analyses of chemical shifts and the temperature dependence of the paramagnetically shifted resonances indicate that the Fe(III)-Fe(II) cluster in the reduced protein exhibits weak antiferromagnetic exchange coupling (-J approximately equal to 10 cm-1), in agreement with the estimate derived from the temperature dependence of the EPR signal intensity. Purple (oxidized) uteroferrin, on the other hand, exhibits no discernible paramagnetically shifted resonances, reflecting either strong antiferromagnetic coupling or an unfavorable electron spin-lattice relaxation time. Evans susceptibility comparisons between pink and purple uteroferrin show that the Fe(III)-Fe(III) cluster in the oxidized protein is more strongly coupled (-J greater than 40 cm-1). This value concurs with low temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements on both the porcine and splenic purple acid phosphatases. The isotropically shifted protons of tyrosine coordinated to the cluster are assigned by comparison with synthetic complexes. Tyrosine, earlier implicated as a ligand by resonance Raman spectroscopy, appears to coordinate only to the ferric site in pink uteroferrin. This is consistent with the relatively invariant extinction coefficients of uteroferrin in its oxidized and reduced forms and the ease of reduction of the nonchromophoric iron compared to its chromophoric partner. Other possible ligands to the cluster include histidine, suggested by the presence of downfield-shifted solvent-exchangeable resonances with appropriate isotropic shifts."
https://openalex.org/W1538757805,"The subunit arrangement of the F0 sector of the Escherichia coli ATP synthase is examined using hydrophilic and hydrophobic (cleavable) cross-linking reagents and the water-soluble labeling reagent [35S] diazoniumbenzenesulfonate ( [35S]DABS). Cross-linking is performed on purified ATP synthase and inverted minicell membranes. ATP synthase incorporated into liposomes is labeled with [35S]DABS. Three cross-linked products involving the F0 subunits (a, b, and c) are observed with the purified ATP synthase in solution: a-b, b2, and c2 dimers. A cross-link between the F0 and F1 is detected and occurs between the a and beta subunits. A cross-linker independent association between the b and beta subunits is also evident, suggesting that the two subunits are close enough to form a disulfide bridge. A cross-linking reagent stable to reducing agents produces a b-beta dimer, as detected by immunoblotting with anti-beta serum. The c subunit does not cross-link with any F1 polypeptide. Minicell membranes containing ATP synthase polypeptides radioactively labeled in vivo similarly show b2 and c2 dimers after cross-linking. [35S]DABS labels the a and b, but not c, subunits, showing that the a and b, but not c, subunits possess hydrophilic domains. Thus, certain domains of subunits a and b extend from the membrane and are in close proximity to one another and the F1 catalytic subunit beta."
https://openalex.org/W2773214419,"The primary translation product of human apolipoprotein A-II was purified from wheat germ and ascites cell-free lysates programmed with RNA isolated from either a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) or intestinal epithelium. A-II mRNA represents 0.2% of the translatable RNA in these hepatocytes and in jejunal epithelium. Plasma high density lipoprotein-associated A-II is a 77-amino acid polypeptide. The primary translation product is 100 amino acids long and contains a 23-amino acid NH2-terminal extension. Cotranslational cleavage of the cell-free product indicated that this NH2-terminal sequence consists of an 18-amino acid long signal peptide, Met-Lys-Leu-Leu-Ala-Ala-X-Val-Leu-Leu-Leu-X-X-Cys-X-Leu-X-X-, and a 5-amino acid long propeptide, Ala-Leu-Val-Arg-Arg. This functional division was confirmed by sequencing the stable intracellular form of apolipoprotein A-II isolated from HepG2 cells. Approximately 45% of the proapo-A-II is cleaved to the mature form during export from HepG2 cells. The COOH-terminal dipeptide conforms to the rule that prosegments are cleaved after paired basic residues. We have previously shown (Gordon, J. I., Sims, H. F., Lentz, S. R., Edelstein, C., Scanu, A. M., and Strauss, A. W. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 4037-4044) that proapolipoprotein A-I is not cleaved during export from these cells and contains a prosegment with a COOH-terminal Gln-Gln dipeptide. Therefore, proteolytic processing of the two principal high density lipoprotein-associated apolipoproteins proceeds along different pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1516304371,"The maturation of bacteriophage lambda DNA and its packaging into preformed heads to produce infectious phage is under the control of the two leftmost genes on the lambda chromosome, i.e., Nu1 and A. Based on its ability to complement lambda A- phage-infected cell extracts for packaging of lambda DNA in vitro, a single protein, designated terminase (ter) has been extensively purified using adsorption, ion exchange, and affinity column chromatography. The final preparation represents an approximately 60,000-fold purification over the activity found in crude extracts and is about 30 to 80% homogeneous as judged by visualizing the protein after electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. In addition to packaging, terminase can also catalyze the endonucleolytic cleavage of lambda cohesive-end site DNA; both of these reactions require ATP. In some preparations, certain terminase fractions of extreme purity require protein factors present in extracts of uninfected Escherichia coli in order to catalyze the cohesive-end site cleavage reaction. On ion exchange columns purified terminase co-chromatographs with a DNA-dependent ATPase activity, hydrolyzing ATP to ADP and Pi in the presence of any of several types of DNA tested including those of non-lambda origin. The molecular weight of the native enzyme is 117,000 and appears to be a hetero-oligomer composed of 2 nonidentical subunits. The most likely composition of terminase is one gpA (gene product of A), Mr = 74,000 and two gpNu1, Mr = 21,000."

The inserted segment (TU1) is flanked by 8-base pair (bp) direct repeats of the H2B sequence. TU1 has long terminal inverted repeats ∼840 bp long with an outer domain of 15-bp tandem repeats and a non-repeating inner domain, and is a member of a heterogeneous family of transposable elements. TU1 differs from most previously characterized eukaryotic transposable elements with terminal direct repats, but resembles the foldback transposon family in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1550528569,"The collagen substrate specificity of rat uterus collagenase was studied as a function of both collagen type and species of substrate origin. For each collagen examined, values for the basic kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax (kcat), were determined on collagen in solution at 25 degrees C. In all cases, Lineweaver-Burk plots were linear and rat uterus collagenase behaved as a normal Michaelis-Menten enzyme. Collagen types I, II, and III of all species tested were degraded by rat uterus collagenase. Collagen types IV and V were resistant to enzymatic attack. Both enzyme-substrate affinity and catalytic rates were very similar for all susceptible collagens (types I-III). Values for Km ranged from 0.9 to 2.5 X 10(-6) M. Values for kcat varied from 10.7 to 28.1 h-1. The homologous rat type I collagen was no better a substrate than the other animal species type I collagens. The ability of rat uterus collagenase to degrade collagen types I, II, and III with essentially the same catalytic efficiency is unlike the action of human skin fibroblast collagenase or any other interstitial collagenase reported to date. The action of rat uterus collagenase on type I collagen was compared to that of human skin fibroblast collagenase, with regard to their capacity to cleave collagen as solution monomers versus insoluble fibrils. Both enzymes had essentially equal values for kcat on monomeric collagen, yet the specific activity of the rat uterus collagenase was 3- to 6-fold greater on collagen fibrils than the skin fibroblast enzyme. Thus, in spite of their similar activity on collagen monomers in solution, the rat uterus collagenase can degrade collagen aggregated into fibrils considerably more readily than can human skin fibroblast collagenase."
https://openalex.org/W1579587268,"The genes for the classical transplantation antigens are unique in that they belong to a multigene family of which each member is represented by a large number of alleles. Since all of these genes are highly related in sequence, it has been difficult to study the expression of individual members of this complex gene family. Based upon our initial suggestion that the 3' noncoding regions of these genes may be useful in identifying mRNA molecules transcribed from different loci, we have compared a large number of sequences from different inbred mouse strains and have been able to assign each of these sequences without ambiguity into distinct allelic series. Such accurate assignment has afforded the opportunity to compare the coding regions of these highly homologous genes and has led to the identification of sequences which are apparently unique to specific genes in the family. Synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to each of the locus-specific unique regions have been used successfully to type a panel of cDNA sequences, as well as to quantitate the relative amounts of mRNA transcribed from distinct loci. The availability of these specific coding probes will allow the analysis of individual genes and their specific expression without interference from other highly homologous sequences in this multigene family."
https://openalex.org/W1603888417,"Collagenase preparations (a mixture of enzymes including collagenase, clostripain, and a casein-degrading protease) degraded the beta subunit (Mr = 95,000) of the purified insulin receptor into fragments of Mr less than 15,000, without degrading the alpha subunit. The resulting beta-digested insulin receptor preparations were found to bind insulin as well as control insulin receptor, as assessed by either cross-linking of 125I-insulin to the digested receptor or by separating insulin bound to receptor from free insulin by high performance liquid chromatography. Moreover, the beta-digested insulin receptor preparations were still precipitated by a monoclonal antibody directed against the insulin-binding site. In contrast, the beta-digested insulin receptor lacked protein kinase activity since it no longer phosphorylated either itself, or an exogenous substrate, calf thymus histone. These results support the identification of the beta subunit of the insulin receptor as a protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1547677557,"Native Bacillus subtilis glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster in the diamagnetic (+2) state. The cluster is essential for catalytic function, even though amidotransferase does not catalyze a redox reaction. The ability of the Fe-S cluster to undergo oxidation and reduction reactions and the consequences of changes in the redox state of the cluster for enzyme activity were studied. Treatment of the enzyme with oxidants resulted in either no reaction or complete dissolution of the Fe-S cluster and loss of activity. A stable +3 oxidation state was not detected. A small amount of paramagnetic species, probably an oxidized 3Fe cluster, was formed transiently during oxidation. The native cluster was poorly reduced by dithionite, but it could be readily reduced to the +1 state by photoreduction with 5-deazaflavin and oxalate. The reduced enzyme did not display an EPR spectrum typical of [4Fe-4S] ferredoxins in the +1 state, unless it was prepared under denaturing conditions. Mossbauer spectroscopy of reduced 57Fe-enriched amidotransferase confirmed that the cluster was in the +1 state, but the magnetic properties of the reduced cluster observed at 4.2 K indicated that it is characterized by a ground state spin S greater than or equal to 3/2. The midpoint potential of the +1/+2 couple was too low to measure accurately by conventional techniques, but it was below -600 mV, which is 100 mV more negative than reported for [4Fe-4S] clusters in bacterial ferredoxins. Fully reduced amidotransferase had about 40% of the activity of the native enzyme in glutamine-dependent phosphoribosylamine formation. The fact that both the +1 and +2 forms of the enzyme are active indicates that the cluster does not function as a site of reversible electron transfer during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1632637254,"The in vitro initiation site for RNA polymerase I on the mouse rRNA gene was identified using a new method that is generally applicable to the study of other eukaryotic transcripts. First, the 5' end of mouse rRNA was located to an ApC . . . by high resolution S1 nuclease mapping. Dinucleotide primers were then used in transcription reactions to demonstrate that this position is the actual de novo initiation site, and not a rapid RNA processing site. For this analysis, initiation was inhibited by reduced rXTP concentration, and, upon supplementation with various dinucleotides, only ApC stimulated correct synthesis. Independently confirming its role as the initiating nucleotide, ATP was shown to be required at a much higher concentration than the other rXTPs for RNA initiation, but not for elongation. These results also demonstrate a marked sequence conservation of rRNA initiation sites between the mouse and frog, two species that violate the general rule of species specificity in RNA polymerase I initiation. Extending these studies to RNA polymerase III, the initiation site for 5 S RNA can be similarly located by dinucleotide analysis and confirmed from the concentration requirements of each rXTP. In addition to allowing initiation at suboptimal rXTP concentration, dinucleotide primers can also circumvent the need for a factor normally required for initiation, suggesting their potential value in dissecting the mechanism of eukaryotic transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2133740188,"Abstract PC12 is a nerve growth factor (NGF) responsive cell line which exhibits two classes of NGF receptors distinguishable by different kinetic rate constants, sensitivity to trypsin and resistance to Triton detergent solubilization. Whereas incubation of PC12 cells with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) prior to addition of 125I-NGF inhibits binding of NGF to both classes of receptors, treatment with WGA subsequent to incubation with NGF does not inhibit NGF binding but causes the class of NGF receptors which exhibit rapid or dissociation kinetics prior to lectin treatment to be converted to the form which exhibits dissociation kinetics. This WGA-mediated receptor conversion is lectin specific, blocked by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, occurs at similar rates at 4 and 37 degrees C, and is not impaired by a metabolic poison. NGF receptors converted by WGA, like pre-existing Slow receptors, are resistant to trypsinization and remain associated to Triton X-100 extracted cytoskeletons. Very similar results were obtained for NGF receptors on a human melanoma cell line A875. These results suggest that Fast and Slow receptors are two interconvertible forms of a single protein, rather than distinct proteins. The significance of the generality of these properties for NGF receptors from diverse species and cell types is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1563501124,"Abstract Treatment of complex III with dicyclohexyldicarbodiimide (DCCD) either before or after incorporation into liposomes resulted in a loss of electrogenic proton movements; however, only minimal decreases in cytochrome c reductase activity were noted in the liposomes containing DCCD-treated complex III. Thus, DCCD appears to act by uncoupling proton translocation from electron transport. A decreased sensitivity of the ubiquinol:cytochrome c reductase activity to antimycin was also noted in the DCCD-treated complex III. This loss of sensitivity to antimycin was reflected in a decreased binding of antimycin to the complex after DCCD treatment from 9.5 nmol/mg of protein in the control to 3.8 nmol/mg of protein in the DCCD-treated complex. DCCD also affected the red shift observed after antimycin addition to dithionite-reduced complex III resulting in a broad peak with no sharp maximum. Similarly, DCCD treatment of yeast mitochondria resulted in a complete loss in the red shift after antimycin addition to mitochondria previously reduced with succinate. No loss in enzymatic activity was observed in the DCCD-treated mitochondria. These results suggest that DCCD concomitant with the inhibition of proton ejection in the cytochrome b-c1 region of the respiratory chain causes modifications in the properties of cytochrome b which alter the binding of antimycin without significantly affecting the electron transfer activity of this cytochrome."
https://openalex.org/W1567973599,"Subunit 9 of ATPase is known to be encoded in the oli1 gene of yeast mitochondrial DNA. The oli1 transcripts of wild type and of a cytoplasmic mutant have been analyzed by hybridization of mitochondrial RNA to various DNA fragments from the internal and flanking regions of the gene and by S1 nuclease mapping of the 5' and 3' ends. The results of such studies indicate that the ATPase gene is co-transcribed with the downstream serine tRNA gene. The oli1 message and tRNA are generated by post-transcriptional processing. Two of the nucleolytic processing steps are blocked in the cytoplasmic petite mutant, resulting in the accumulation of several different intermediate transcripts containing both genes. Processing of the 3' ends occurs near a common seven-nucleotide sequence (5'-ATTCTTA-3') also found in the 3' regions of other mitochondrial genes. This sequence is proposed to be part of a signal necessary for either termination of transcription or RNA processing."
https://openalex.org/W1585000618,"The gp52 glycoprotein of the spleen focus-forming virus found in the Friend and Rauscher complexes of murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) has been previously identified as a recombinant molecule involving substitutions and deletions of the MuLV env gene. Unlike the MuLV structural glycoproteins, gp52 is defective in its transport to the cell surface. We have studied aspects of the intracellular transport and membrane association of gp52 to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the defective transport process. It was found that a panel of monoclonal antibodies to different epitopes of p 15E, as well as an antiserum to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxy terminus of MuLV envelope precursors, failed to react with gp52. Despite the possible absence of membrane-anchoring regions of MuLV envelope proteins known to reside on p 15E, gp52 was not found to be secreted into the culture fluids. Detergent extraction studies indicated that gp52 is associated with the membranes and not the contents of microsomal vesicles in speen focus-forming virus-infected cells. gp65, the processed form of gp52, could be labeled with [3H]palmitic acid, suggesting a membrane association. To determine whether a spontaneous denaturation occurs leading to aggregation and defective transport of gp52, we studied the surface expression of gp52 in cells grown at different temperatures, as well as the solubility of gp52 in low concentrations of Triton X-100. No evidence of aggregation or of a temperature-dependent difference in transport was obtained. gp52 appears to be a monotopic integral membrane protein, unlike MuLV envelope proteins which are bitopic integral membrane proteins; proteolytic digestion of intact microsomal vesicles did not reveal a detectable cytoplasmic tail under conditions where this could be demonstrated on MuLV envelope precursors. We suggest that a loss of putative signals involved in mediating intracellular transport is a likely cause for the defective transport of the spleen focus-forming virus glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1560339718,"The complete nucleotide sequence has been determined for three newly cloned evolutionary variants from two different independently generated evolutionary series (1100 and 2100 series) of simian virus 40 (SV40). These naturally arising variants, designated ev-1110, ev-2102, and ev-2114, were isolated after five high multiplicity serial passages. The structure of the variants consists of a monomeric unit tandemly repeated four times (ev-2102 and ev-2114) or six times (ev-1110) in the variant genome; the variants have four or six copies, respectively, of the viral origin signal for DNA replication. The DNA content in the three variants is vastly different in that the genome of variant ev-2114 contains only rearranged viral sequences, while variant ev-2102 contains a substitution with monkey DNA sequences consisting of a nearly complete dimeric unit of Alu family sequences as well as less repetitive sequences and variant ev-1110 contains monkey DNA sequences derived solely from repetitive alpha-component DNA. Recombination events, cellular sequences, and structural features of these and other naturally arising SV40 variants are compared."
https://openalex.org/W1484536227,"Abstract Transcription of certain SV40 and adenovirus genes can be selectively enhanced under suitable in vitro assay conditions. The major SV40 late promoters and the adeno IVa2 promoter do not have TATA box sequences upstream from the start sites of transcription. Analyses of transcripts synthesized in vitro from the SV40 late promoters by run-off and S1 nuclease mapping methods show that when transcription takes place in the presence of 15 mM (NH4)2SO4, there is a 3- to 5-fold stimulation of RNA synthesis initiating from the late promoter at map position 185 and from the SV40 early promoters. RNA initiating from map position 325 is stimulated 40-fold under these conditions. When the (NH4)2SO4 concentration is increased to 50 mM (NH4)2SO4, there is a 90% suppression of transcription. Ammonium sulfate also enhances transcription from the adeno IVa2 promoter, which is not expressed in extracts that lack (NH4)2SO4 (Fire, A., Baker, C. C., Manley, J. L., Ziff, E. B., and Sharp, P. A. (1981) J. Virol. 40, 703-719; Lee, D. C., and Roeder, R. G. (1981) Mol. Cell. Biol. 1, 635-651). These modified assay conditions may allow detection of new classes of promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1511754936,"Abstract The postnatal development of skeletal muscle is characterized by changes in membrane function associated with N-linked glycoproteins. In the present study, reactions involved in the synthesis of the dolichol-linked core oligosaccharide were examined in neonatal and adult rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. The initial rate of N-acetylglucosamine incorporation in the presence of exogenous dolichol phosphate was similar between neonate and adult (3.5-4.1 pmol of GlcNAc/min/mg). The Km values for UDP-GlcNAc and exogenous dolichol phosphate were similar. Tunicamycin (0.04-0.08 micrograms/ml) inhibited N-acetylglucosamine incorporation by 50%. UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphatase activity was greater in neonatal membranes than adult (840 versus 350 pmol of GlcNAc-1-P/min/mg), explaining, in part, the greater enhancement of neonatal GlcNAc incorporation by pyrophosphatase inhibitors. Nucleotide-sugar pyrophosphatase inhibitors (alpha, beta-methylene ATP and dimercaptopropanol) increased the capacity of neonatal activity 4-fold and adult enzyme 2-fold. Analysis of dolichol-linked products by mild acid hydrolysis however, revealed that neonate had higher capacity for N,N'-diacetylchitobiosyl(pyro)phosphoryldolichol synthesis than adult. Mannosyltransferase and glucosyltransferase were elevated 6- and 5-fold in neonate compared to adult membranes. Neonate exhibited 4-fold greater GDP-Man pyrophosphatase activity than adult (500 versus 125 pmol of Man-1-P/min/mg). The Km for GDP-Man increased in the presence of exogenous dolichol phosphate. Increasing concentrations of exogenous dolichol phosphate did not equalize neonate and adult mannosyltransferase activity, indicating that the decline in activity during development was not due to a decrease in a pool of dolichol phosphate accessible to mannosyltransferase. Glucosyltransferase for the synthesis of glucosylphosphoryldolichol was also elevated 5-fold in neonatal compared to adult sarcoplasmic reticulum (7 versus 1.4 pmol of Glc/min/mg). In a previous study, it was reported that glycoprotein sialyltransferase activity decreased by a factor of 6.5 during the postnatal maturation and that total membrane hexose content of sarcoplasmic reticulum decreased by a factor of 8. Together, these results suggest that the postnatal development of skeletal muscle is characterized by coordinated changes in the expression of enzymes involved in both the early and late reactions of N-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1535052213,"The actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin II from Acanthamoeba castellanii is inhibited by phosphorylation of 3 serine residues near the carboxyl end of the heavy chain of the molecule. We have purified a protein phosphatase from Acanthamoeba using myosin II as a substrate. This phosphatase has a molecular weight of 39,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and an isoelectric point in urea of 5.2. The enzyme also is active against other phosphoserine protein substrates such as turkey gizzard smooth muscle myosin light chain, but not against a synthetic phosphotyrosine protein substrate. It does not hydrolyze ATP or p-nitrophenol phosphate. No effector has been found to increase substantially the activity of the enzyme as isolated, but it is inhibited by ATP, pyrophosphate, and NaF. This inhibition is reduced in the presence of MnCl2. The Mg2+-dependent actin-activated ATPase of myosin II is activated by dephosphorylation of phosphorylated myosin II by the phosphatase. Its broad substrate specificity, molecular weight, and response to protein phosphatase inhibitors suggest that the Acanthamoeba protein phosphatase is a type 2A phosphatase (Cohen, P. (1982) Nature (Lond.) 206, 613-620)."
https://openalex.org/W1843293211,"Nuclease digestion of isolated nuclei was used to test whether differential chromatin structure exists for a dosage-compensated heat shock gene in Drosophila pseudoobscura. No differences were observed in nuclease sensitivity at this locus in males and females, either under heat shock or non-heat shock conditions, using micrococcal nuclease or DNase I. Although the higher level of nuclease sensitivity characterized by the induced state was removed when nuclei were prepared in high salt (0.45 M sodium chloride), this procedure did not reveal covert differences in X-linked chromatin structure between males and females. However, a clear difference was observed in the nuclease sensitivity at low level (uninduced) and high level (heat-induced) expression of the X-linked heat shock gene, suggesting that the same gene transcribed at two steady state rates can have different chromatin structures."
