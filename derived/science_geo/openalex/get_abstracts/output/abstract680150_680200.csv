https://openalex.org/W3198192071,"To access superconductivity via the electric field effect in a clean, two-dimensional device is a central goal of nanoelectronics. Recently, superconductivity has been realized in graphene moiré heterostructures1–4; however, many of these structures are not mechanically stable, and experiments show signatures of strong disorder. Here we report the observation of superconductivity—manifesting as low or vanishing resistivity at sub-kelvin temperatures—in crystalline rhombohedral trilayer graphene5,6, a structurally metastable carbon allotrope. Superconductivity occurs in two distinct gate-tuned regions (SC1 and SC2), and is deep in the clean limit defined by the ratio of mean free path and superconducting coherence length. Mapping of the normal state Fermi surfaces by quantum oscillations reveals that both superconductors emerge from an annular Fermi sea, and are proximal to an isospin-symmetry-breaking transition where the Fermi surface degeneracy changes7. SC1 emerges from a paramagnetic normal state, whereas SC2 emerges from a spin-polarized, valley-unpolarized half-metal17 and violates the Pauli limit for in-plane magnetic fields by at least one order of magnitude8,9. We discuss our results in view of several mechanisms, including conventional phonon-mediated pairing10,11, pairing due to fluctuations of the proximal isospin order12, and intrinsic instabilities of the annular Fermi liquid13,14. Our observation of superconductivity in a clean and structurally simple two-dimensional metal provides a model system to test competing theoretical models of superconductivity without the complication of modelling disorder, while enabling new classes of field-effect controlled electronic devices based on correlated electron phenomena and ballistic electron transport. Superconductivity is observed in rhombohedral trilayer graphene in the absence of a moiré superlattice, with two distinct superconducting states both occurring at a symmetry-breaking transition where the Fermi surface degeneracy changes."
https://openalex.org/W3198756442,"Ferromagnetism is most common in transition metal compounds where electrons occupy highly localized d orbitals. However, ferromagnetic order may also arise in low-density two-dimensional electron systems1-5. Here we show that gate-tuned van Hove singularities in rhombohedral trilayer graphene6 drive spontaneous ferromagnetic polarization of the electron system into one or more spin and valley flavours. Using capacitance and transport measurements, we observe a cascade of transitions tuned to the density and electronic displacement field between phases in which quantum oscillations have fourfold, twofold or onefold degeneracy, associated with a spin- and valley-degenerate normal metal, spin-polarized 'half-metal', and spin- and valley-polarized 'quarter-metal', respectively. For electron doping, the salient features of the data are well captured by a phenomenological Stoner model7 that includes valley-anisotropic interactions. For hole filling, we observe a richer phase diagram featuring a delicate interplay of broken symmetries and transitions in the Fermi surface topology. Finally, we introduce a moiré superlattice using a rotationally aligned hexagonal boron nitride substrate5,8. Remarkably, we find that the isospin order is only weakly perturbed, with the moiré potential catalysing the formation of topologically nontrivial gapped states whenever itinerant half- or quarter-metal states occur at half- or quarter-superlattice band filling. Our results show that rhombohedral graphene is an ideal platform for well-controlled tests of many-body theory, and reveal magnetism in moiré materials4,5,9,10 to be fundamentally itinerant in nature."
https://openalex.org/W3196689654,"The amount of carbon stored in deadwood is equivalent to about 8 per cent of the global forest carbon stocks1. The decomposition of deadwood is largely governed by climate2–5 with decomposer groups—such as microorganisms and insects—contributing to variations in the decomposition rates2,6,7. At the global scale, the contribution of insects to the decomposition of deadwood and carbon release remains poorly understood7. Here we present a field experiment of wood decomposition across 55 forest sites and 6 continents. We find that the deadwood decomposition rates increase with temperature, and the strongest temperature effect is found at high precipitation levels. Precipitation affects the decomposition rates negatively at low temperatures and positively at high temperatures. As a net effect—including the direct consumption by insects and indirect effects through interactions with microorganisms—insects accelerate the decomposition in tropical forests (3.9% median mass loss per year). In temperate and boreal forests, we find weak positive and negative effects with a median mass loss of 0.9 per cent and −0.1 per cent per year, respectively. Furthermore, we apply the experimentally derived decomposition function to a global map of deadwood carbon synthesized from empirical and remote-sensing data, obtaining an estimate of 10.9 ± 3.2 petagram of carbon per year released from deadwood globally, with 93 per cent originating from tropical forests. Globally, the net effect of insects may account for 29 per cent of the carbon flux from deadwood, which suggests a functional importance of insects in the decomposition of deadwood and the carbon cycle. Multi-year field experiments across six continents suggest that insects have an important contribution to decomposition and carbon release from forest deadwood."

https://openalex.org/W3196780279,"This paper quantifies the net impact (direct and indirect effects) of the pandemic on the United States population in 2020 using three metrics: excess deaths, life expectancy, and total years of life lost. The findings indicate there were 375,235 excess deaths, with 83% attributable to direct, and 17% attributable to indirect effects of COVID-19. The decrease in life expectancy was 1.67 years, translating to a reversion of 14 years in historical life expectancy gains. Total years of life lost in 2020 was 7,362,555 across the USA (73% directly attributable, 27% indirectly attributable to COVID-19), with considerable heterogeneity at the individual state level."
https://openalex.org/W3197882632,"Conventional wisdom holds that macroscopic classical phenomena naturally emerge from microscopic quantum laws1-7. However, despite this mantra, building direct connections between these two descriptions has remained an enduring scientific challenge. In particular, it is difficult to quantitatively predict the emergent 'classical' properties of a system (for example, diffusivity, viscosity and compressibility) from a generic microscopic quantum Hamiltonian7-14. Here we introduce a hybrid solid-state spin platform, where the underlying disordered, dipolar quantum Hamiltonian gives rise to the emergence of unconventional spin diffusion at nanometre length scales. In particular, the combination of positional disorder and on-site random fields leads to diffusive dynamics that are Fickian yet non-Gaussian15-20. Finally, by tuning the underlying parameters within the spin Hamiltonian via a combination of static and driven fields, we demonstrate direct control over the emergent spin diffusion coefficient. Our work enables the investigation of hydrodynamics in many-body quantum spin systems."
https://openalex.org/W3197647640,"Persistent activity underlying short-term memory encodes sensory information or instructs specific future movement and, consequently, has a crucial role in cognition. Despite extensive study, how the same set of neurons respond differentially to form selective persistent activity remains unknown. Here, we report that the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical (CBTC) circuit supports the formation of selective persistent activity in mice. Optogenetic activation or inactivation of the basal ganglia output nucleus substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr)-to-thalamus pathway biased future licking choice, without affecting licking execution. This perturbation differentially affected persistent activity in the frontal cortex and selectively modulated neural trajectory that encodes one choice but not the other. Recording showed that SNr neurons had selective persistent activity distributed across SNr, but with a hotspot in the mediolateral region. Optogenetic inactivation of the frontal cortex also differentially affected persistent activity in the SNr. Together, these results reveal a CBTC channel functioning to produce selective persistent activity underlying short-term memory."

https://openalex.org/W3196695823,"Political ideologies drove public actions and health behaviors in the first year of the global pandemic. Different ideas about contagion, health behaviors, and the actions of governing bodies impacted the spread of the virus and health and life. Researchers used an immediate, mixed methods design to explore sociocultural responses to the virus and identified differences and similarities in anxiety, fear, blame, and perceptions of nation across political divides.Researchers conducted 60 in-depth, semi-structured interviews and administered over 1,000 questionnaires with people living in the United States. The team analyzed data through an exploratory and confirmatory sequential mixed methods design.In the first months of the pandemic interviewees cited economic inequality, untrustworthy corporations and other entities, and the federal government as threats to life and pandemic control. Participants invoked ideas about others to determine blame. Findings reveal heavy associations between lack of safety during a public health crisis and blame of ""culture"" and government power across the political spectrum.Data indicate anxiety across political differences related to ideas of contagion and the maleficence of a powerful elite. Findings on how people understand the nation, politics, and pandemic management contribute to understanding dimensions of health behaviors and underlying connections between anxiety and the uptake of conspiracy theories in public health. The article ends with recommendations drawn from project findings for future pandemic response."
https://openalex.org/W3198208165,"Objectives To determine whether librarian or information specialist authorship is associated with better reproducibility of the search, at least three databases searched, and better reporting quality in dental systematic reviews (SRs). Methods SRs from the top ten dental research journals (as determined by Journal Citation Reports and Scimago) were reviewed for search quality and reproducibility by independent reviewers using two Qualtrics survey instruments. Data was reviewed for all SRs based on reproducibility and librarian participation and further reviewed for search quality of reproducible searches. Results Librarians were co-authors in only 2.5% of the 913 included SRs and librarians were mentioned or acknowledged in only 9% of included SRs. Librarian coauthors were associated with more reproducible searches, higher search quality, and at least three databases searched. Although the results indicate librarians are associated with improved SR quality, due to the small number of SRs that included a librarian, results were not statistically significant. Conclusion Despite guidance from organizations that produce SR guidelines recommending the inclusion of a librarian or information specialist on the review team, and despite evidence showing that librarians improve the reproducibility of searches and the reporting of methodology in SRs, librarians are not being included in SRs in the field of dental medicine. The authors of this review recommend the inclusion of a librarian on SR teams in dental medicine and other fields."

https://openalex.org/W3196572754,"Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a key player in the Hippo pathway, has been shown to play a critical role in tumor progression. However, the role of YAP1 in prostate cancer cell invasion, migration, and metastasis is not well defined. Through functional, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic analyses, we showed that prolyl hydroxylation of YAP1 plays a critical role in the suppression of cell migration, invasion, and metastasis in prostate cancer. Knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO) of YAP1 led to an increase in cell migration, invasion, and metastasis in prostate cancer cells. Microarray analysis showed that the EMT pathway was activated in Yap1-KD cells. ChIP-seq analysis showed that YAP1 target genes are enriched in pathways regulating cell migration. Mass spectrometry analysis identified P4H prolyl hydroxylase in the YAP1 complex and YAP1 was hydroxylated at multiple proline residues. Proline-to-alanine mutations of YAP1 isoform 3 identified proline 174 as a critical residue, and its hydroxylation suppressed cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. KO of P4ha2 led to an increase in cell migration and invasion, which was reversed upon Yap1 KD. Our study identified a novel regulatory mechanism of YAP1 by which P4HA2-dependent prolyl hydroxylation of YAP1 determines its transcriptional activities and its function in prostate cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3165270933,"The increasing availability of textual corpora and data fetched from social networks is fuelling a huge production of works based on the model proposed by psychologist Robert Plutchik, often referred simply as the ""Plutchik Wheel"". Related researches range from annotation tasks description to emotions detection tools. Visualisation of such emotions is traditionally carried out using the most popular layouts, as bar plots or tables, which are however sub-optimal. The classic representation of the Plutchik's wheel follows the principles of proximity and opposition between pairs of emotions: spatial proximity in this model is also a semantic proximity, as adjacent emotions elicit a complex emotion (a primary dyad) when triggered together; spatial opposition is a semantic opposition as well, as positive emotions are opposite to negative emotions. The most common layouts fail to preserve both features, not to mention the need of visually allowing comparisons between different corpora in a blink of an eye, that is hard with basic design solutions. We introduce PyPlutchik the Pyplutchik package is available as a Github repository (http://github.com/alfonsosemeraro/pyplutchik) or through the installation commands pip or conda. For any enquiry about usage or installation feel free to contact the corresponding author, a Python module specifically designed for the visualisation of Plutchik's emotions in texts or in corpora. PyPlutchik draws the Plutchik's flower with each emotion petal sized after how much that emotion is detected or annotated in the corpus, also representing three degrees of intensity for each of them. Notably, PyPlutchik allows users to display also primary, secondary, tertiary and opposite dyads in a compact, intuitive way. We substantiate our claim that PyPlutchik outperforms other classic visualisations when displaying Plutchik emotions and we showcase a few examples that display our module's most compelling features."
https://openalex.org/W3197127409,"While there has been much speculation on how the pandemic has affected work location patterns and home location choices, there is sparse evidence regarding the impacts that COVID-19 has had on amenity visits in American cities, which typically constitute over half of all urban trips. Using aggregate app-based GPS positioning data from smartphone users, this study traces the changes in amenity visits in Somerville, MA from January 2019 to December 2020, describing how visits to particular types of amenities have changed as a result of business closures during the public health emergency. Has the pandemic fundamentally shifted amenity-oriented travel behavior or is consumer behavior returning to pre-pandemic trends? To address this question, we calibrate discrete choice models that are suited to Census block-group level analysis for each of the 24 months in a two-year period, and use them to analyze how visitors’ behavioral responses to various attributes of amenity clusters have shifted during different phases of the pandemic. Our findings suggest that in the first few months of the pandemic, amenity-visiting preferences significantly diverged from expected patterns. Even though overall trip volumes remained far below normal levels throughout the remainder of the year, preferences towards specific cluster attributes mostly returned to expected levels by September 2020. We also construct two scenarios to explore the implications of another shutdown and a full reopening, based on November 2020 consumer behavior. While government restrictions have played an important role in reducing visits to amenity clusters, our results imply that cautionary consumer behavior has played an important role as well, suggesting a likely long and slow path to economic recovery. By drawing on mobile phone location data and behavioral modeling, this paper offers timely insights to help decision-makers understand how this unprecedented health emergency is affecting amenity-related trips and where the greatest needs for intervention and support may exist."
https://openalex.org/W3197924548,"A report published last year by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) highlighted that COVID-19 case counts are more likely to be high in lower quality nursing homes than in higher quality ones. Since then, multiple studies have examined this association with a handful also exploring the role of facility quality in explaining resident deaths from the virus. Despite this wide interest, no previous study has investigated how the relation between quality and COVID-19 mortality among nursing home residents may have changed, if at all, over the progression of the pandemic. This understanding is indeed lacking given that prior studies are either cross-sectional or are analyses limited to one specific state or region of the country. To address this gap, we analyzed changes in nursing home resident deaths across the US between June 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021 (n = 12,415 nursing homes X 8 months) using both descriptive and multivariable statistics. We merged publicly available data from multiple federal agencies with mortality rate (per 100,000 residents) as the outcome and CMS 5-star quality rating as the primary explanatory variable of interest. Covariates, based on the prior literature, consisted of both facility- and community-level characteristics. Findings from our secondary analysis provide robust evidence of the association between nursing home quality and resident deaths due to the virus diminishing over time. In connection, we discuss plausible reasons, especially duration of staff shortages, that over time might have played a critical role in driving the quality-mortality convergence across nursing homes in the US."
https://openalex.org/W3196317127,"Abstract Magnetospheric accretion models predict that matter from protoplanetary disks accretes onto stars via funnel flows, which follow stellar magnetic field lines and shock on the stellar surfaces 1–3 , leaving hot spots with density gradients 4–6 . Previous work has provided observational evidence of varying density in hot spots 7 , but these observations were not sensitive to the radial density distribution. Attempts have been made to measure this distribution using X-ray observations 8–10 ; however, X-ray emission traces only a fraction of the hot spot 11,12 and also coronal emission 13,14 . Here we report periodic ultraviolet and optical light curves of the accreting star GM Aurigae, which have a time lag of about one day between their peaks. The periodicity arises because the source of the ultraviolet and optical emission moves into and out of view as it rotates along with the star. The time lag indicates a difference in the spatial distribution of ultraviolet and optical brightness over the stellar surface. Within the framework of a magnetospheric accretion model, this finding indicates the presence of a radial density gradient in a hot spot on the stellar surface, because regions of the hot spot with different densities have different temperatures and therefore emit radiation at different wavelengths."
https://openalex.org/W3197406186,"Humans are extraordinarily social, and social isolation has profound effects on our behavior, ranging from increased social motivation following short periods of social isolation to increased anti-social behaviors following long-term social isolation. Mice are frequently used as a model to understand how social isolation impacts the brain and behavior. While the effects of chronic social isolation on mouse social behavior have been well studied, much less is known about how acute isolation impacts mouse social behavior and whether these effects vary according to the sex of the mouse and the behavioral context of the social encounter. To address these questions, we characterized the effects of acute (3-day) social isolation on the vocal and non-vocal social behaviors of male and female mice during same-sex and opposite-sex social interactions. Our experiments uncovered pronounced effects of acute isolation on social interactions between female mice, while revealing more subtle effects on the social behaviors of male mice during same-sex and opposite-sex interactions. Our findings advance the study of same-sex interactions between female mice as an attractive paradigm to investigate neural mechanisms through which acute isolation enhances social motivation and promotes social behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3196831373,"This study is to investigate whether the cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) can regulate the autophagy of cardiomyocytes (CMs) by secreting lncRNA-ANRIL/miR-181b exosomes, thus participating in the occurrence of uremic cardiovascular disease (CVD).A 5/6 nephrectomy uremia model was established, with the mice injected with ANRIL-shRNA lentivirus vector, miR-181b agomir, and related control reagents, containing the serum creatinine and urea nitrogen measured. The renal tissue sections of mice were stained with Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS), TUNEL, and Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) performed on myocardial tissue sections of mice. ANRIL-shRNA, miR-181b mimics, and related control reagents were transfected into CMECs, in which the exosomes were extracted and co-cultured with CMs. The expressions of ANRIL, miR-181b and ATG5 were detected by qRT-PCR, and the expressions of autophagy related proteins by Western blot, as well as the binding of ANRIL and miR-181b by the double luciferase reporter gene experiment.ANRIL down-regulation or miR-181b up-regulation can increase the weight of mice with uremia, as well as the expressions of p62 and miR-181b, and reduce the content of serum creatinine and urea nitrogen, the damage of kidney and myocardial tissues, the number of apoptotic cells in myocardial tissues, as well as the expressions of ANRIL, ATG5, Beclin1, and LC3. CMs can absorb the exosomes of CMECs. Compared with IS+ CMEC-Exo group, the expressions of ANRIL and ATG5 in CMs of IS+ CMEC-Exo + sh lncRNA ANRIL and IS+CMEC-Exo+miR-181b mimics groups was down-regulated, as well as the expressions of ATG5, Beclin1, and LC3, while miR-181b expression was up-regulated as well as P62 expression.CMECs can regulate autophagy of CMs by releasing exosomes containing ANRIL and miR-181b."

Also there is less research in comparing use of self -regulated learning strategies between blended and other learning strategies. Primary aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of blended learning on knowledge score using clinical research modules. Secondary objective was designed to compare the use of self-regulated learning strategies between blended learning, web-based e-learning and didactic teaching.A prospective cluster randomized trial was conducted with didactic teaching as control and web-based e-learning and blended learning as interventions. The target population was final year Pharm D students. Outcome was assessed using a validated knowledge questionnaire, a motivated strategies for learning questionnaire and a feedback form. All statistical analyses were carried out using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) Version 20.A total of 241 students from 12 colleges completed the study. Mean knowledge score of students in blended learning group was higher than those in the didactic teaching and web- based e- learning program (64.26±18.19 Vs 56.65±8.73 Vs 52.11±22.06,p<0.001).Frequency of use of learning strategies namely rehearsal, elaboration, organization and critical thinking was statistically significantly higher in the blended learning group compared to those of didactic and web-based e-learning group (p<0.05) But there were no statistically significant difference of motivational orientations between didactic and blended learning group except strategies of extrinsic goal orientation and self-efficacy. Students preferred blended learning (86.5%) over didactic and web-based e-learning.Blended learning approach is an effective way to teach clinical research module. Students of blended learning group employed all motivational and learning strategies more often than students of the didactic and web- based e-learning groups except strategies of intrinsic goal orientation, task value, control of learning belief and help seeking."
https://openalex.org/W3196774688,"In this study we investigate whether the increasing investment in smallholder oil palm plantations that contributes to deforestation is motivated by financial gains or other factors. We evaluate the financial viability of smallholder farmers selling fresh fruit bunches (FFBs) to intermediaries or agro-industrial companies with mills, or processing the FFBs in artisanal mills to produce palm oil. We use data collected in four oil palm production basins in Cameroon and carried out a life cycle assessment of oil palm cultivation and CPO production to understand financial gains. We use payback period (PBP), internal rate of return (IRR), benefit cost ratio (BCR) and net present value (NPV) for 1 ha of oil palm plantation over 28 years at a base discount rate of 8% to asses viability. Our results show that smallholders make more money processing their FFBs in artisanal mills to produce CPO than selling FFBs to intermediaries or agro-industrial companies with mills. The sensitivity analysis show that land ownership is the single most important parameter in the profitability of investment in palm oil cultivation and trade. In addition to land cost, smallholders suffer from borrowing at high interest rates, high field management costs, while recording low on-farm FFB/processing yields. To improve the financial viability of smallholders investing in oil palm cultivation, measures are needed to encourage them to access land, get loans at reduced interest rates, reduce the cost of field management, adopt good agricultural practices to improve on-farm FFB/processing yields, as well as to generate additional revenue from the sale of other products."

Pollen grain recognition is commonly performed by visual inspection by a trained person. An alternative method for visual inspection is automated pollen analysis based on the image analysis technique. Image analysis transfers visual information to mathematical descriptions. In this work, the suitability of three microscopic techniques for automatic analysis of pollen grains was studied. 2D and 3D morphological characteristics, textural and colour features, and extended depth of focus characteristics were used for the pollen discrimination. In this study, 7 botanical taxa and a total of 2482 pollen grains were evaluated. The highest correct classification rate of 93.05% was achieved using the phase contrast microscopy, followed by the dark field microscopy reaching 91.02%, and finally by the light field microscopy reaching 88.88%. The most significant discriminant characteristics were morphological (2D and 3D) and colour characteristics. Our results confirm the potential of using automatic pollen analysis to discriminate pollen taxa in honey. This work provides the basis for further research where the taxa dataset will be increased, and new descriptors will be studied."
https://openalex.org/W3198181223,"Research examining the associations between movement behaviours and mental health indicators within a compositional framework are sparse and limited by their cross-sectional study design. This study has three objectives. First, to describe the change in movement behaviour composition over time. Second, to explore the association between change in movement behaviour composition and change in depressive symptoms. Third, to explore how reallocations of time between movement behaviours are associated with changes in depressive symptoms.Longitudinal data of 14,620 students in grades 9-12 (mean age: 14.9 years) attending secondary schools in Canada (Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec) were obtained from two waves (2017/18, 2018/19) of the COMPASS study. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), recreational screen time, and sleep duration were self-reported. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (Revised)-10 (CESD-R-10). Compositional data analyses using pivot coordinates and compositional isotemporal substitution for longitudinal data were used to analyse the data. Analyses accounted for school clustering, were stratified by gender and age (< or ≥ 15 years), and were adjusted for race/ethnicity, body mass index z-score, baseline movement behaviour composition, and baseline depressive symptoms.There were significant differences in movement behaviour composition over time across all subgroups. For example, the relative contributions of MVPA and sleep duration to the movement behaviour composition decreased over time while screen time increased among younger boys and girls and older girls. Increasing sleep duration relative to the remaining behaviours (i.e. screen time and MVPA) was associated with lower depressive symptoms among all subgroups. Increasing screen time relative to the remaining behaviours (i.e. MVPA and sleep duration) was associated with higher depressive symptoms among all subgroups. Increasing MVPA relative to the remaining behaviours (i.e. screen time and sleep duration) was associated with lower depressive symptoms in older girls only. Isotemporal substitution estimates indicated that decreasing screen time by 60 minutes/day and replacing that time with 60 minutes of additional sleep is associated with the largest change in depressive symptoms across all subgroups.Findings from this prospective analysis suggest that increased sleep duration and reduced screen time are important determinants of lower depressive symptoms among adolescents."

Our study is an important step forward in the conceptual development of leader character and the application of character to enhance workplace practices. We combined confirmatory factor analysis and network-based analysis to determine the factorial and network structure of leader character. The findings revealed that a model of 11 inter-correlated leader character dimensions fit the data better than a single-factor model. Further, judgment appeared as the most central dimension in a network comprising the 11 character dimensions. Moreover, in a larger network of partial correlations, two ties acted as bridges that link leader character to follower positive outcomes: judgment and drive. Implications for theory and practice are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3198729563,"Communities in social networks often reflect close social ties between their members and their evolution through time. We propose an approach that tracks two aspects of community evolution in retweet networks: flow of the members in, out and between the communities, and their influence. We start with high resolution time windows, and then select several timepoints which exhibit large differences between the communities. For community detection, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we apply an enhanced Louvain algorithm, called Ensemble Louvain, to find stable communities. In the second stage, we form influence links between these communities, and identify linked super-communities. For the detected communities, we compute internal and external influence, and for individual users, the retweet h-index influence. We apply the proposed approach to three years of Twitter data of all Slovenian tweets. The analysis shows that the Slovenian tweetosphere is dominated by politics, that the left-leaning communities are larger, but that the right-leaning communities and users exhibit significantly higher impact. An interesting observation is that retweet networks change relatively gradually, despite such events as the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic or the change of government."
https://openalex.org/W3198780530,"Human-controlled regimes can entrain behavioural responses and may impact animal welfare. Therefore, understanding the influence of schedules on animal behaviour can be a valuable tool to improve welfare, however information on behaviour overnight and in the absence of husbandry staff remains rare. Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) are highly social marine mammals and the most common cetacean found in captivity. They communicate using frequency modulated signature whistles, a whistle type that is individually distinctive and used as a contact call. We investigated the vocalisations of ten dolphins housed in three social groups at uShaka Sea World dolphinarium to determine how patterns in acoustic behaviour link to dolphinarium routines. Investigation focused on overnight behaviour, housing decisions, weekly patterns, and transitional periods between the presence and absence of husbandry staff. Recordings were made from 17h00 - 07h00 over 24 nights, spanning May to August 2018. Whistle (including signature whistle) presence and production rate decreased soon after husbandry staff left the facility, was low over night, and increased upon staff arrival. Results indicated elevated arousal states particularly associated with the morning feeding regime. Housing in the pool configuration that allowed observation of staff activities from all social groups was characterised by an increase in whistle presence and rates. Heightened arousal associated with staff presence was reflected in the structural characteristics of signature whistles, particularly maximum frequency, frequency range and number of whistle loops. We identified individual differences in both production rate and the structural modification of signature whistles under different contexts. Overall, these results revealed a link between scheduled activity and associated behavioural responses, which can be used as a baseline for future welfare monitoring where changes from normal behaviour may reflect shifts in welfare state."
https://openalex.org/W3194373793,"The democratization of AI tools for content generation, combined with unrestricted access to mass media for all (e.g. through microblogging and social media), makes it increasingly hard for people to distinguish fact from fiction. This raises the question of how individual opinions evolve in such a networked environment without grounding in a known reality. The dominant approach to studying this problem uses simple models from the social sciences on how individuals change their opinions when exposed to their social neighborhood, and applies them on large social networks. We propose a novel model that incorporates two known social phenomena: (i) Biased Assimilation: the tendency of individuals to adopt other opinions if they are similar to their own; (ii) Backfire Effect: the fact that an opposite opinion may further entrench people in their stances, making their opinions more extreme instead of moderating them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DeGroot-type opinion formation model that captures the Backfire Effect. A thorough theoretical and empirical analysis of the proposed model reveals intuitive conditions for polarization and consensus to exist, as well as the properties of the resulting opinions."
https://openalex.org/W3198482991,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC) is a distinct molecular subtype of gastric cancer characterized by viral infection and cellular abnormalities, including loss of AT-rich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A) expression (lost ARID1A). To evaluate the significance of lost ARID1A in the development of EBVaGC, we performed in situ hybridization of EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) and immunohistochemistry of ARID1A in the non-neoplastic gastric mucosa and intramucosal cancer tissue of EBVaGC with in vitro infection analysis of ARID1A-knockdown and -knockout gastric cells. Screening of EBER by in situ hybridization revealed a frequency of approximately 0.2% EBER-positive epithelial cells in non-neoplastic gastric mucosa tissue samples. Six small foci of EBV-infected epithelial cells showed two types of histology: degenerated (n = 3) and metaplastic (n = 3) epithelial cells. ARID1A was lost in the former type. In intramucosal EBVaGC, there were ARID1A-lost (n = 5) and -preserved tumors (n = 7), suggesting that ARID1A-lost carcinomas are derived from ARID1A-lost precursor cells in the non-neoplastic mucosa. Lost ARID1A was also observed in non-neoplastic mucosa adjacent to an ARID1A-lost EBVaGC. In vitro experiments using siRNA knockdown and the CRISPR/Cas9-knockout system demonstrated that transient reduction or permanent loss of ARID1A expression markedly increased the efficiency of EBV infection to stomach epithelial cells. Taken together, lost ARID1A plays a role in initiating EBV-driven carcinogenesis in stomach epithelial cells, which develop to a distinct subtype of EBVaGC within the proper mucosal layer. Lost ARID1A is one of the constituents of virus-host interactions in the carcinogenesis of EBVaGC."
https://openalex.org/W3198890080,"There is increasing international interest in place-based approaches to improve early childhood development (ECD) outcomes. The available data and evidence are limited and precludes well informed policy and practice change. Developing the evidence-base for community-level effects on ECD is one way to facilitate more informed and targeted community action. This paper presents overall final findings from the Kids in Communities Study (KiCS), an Australian mixed methods investigation into community-level effects on ECD in five domains of influence-physical, social, governance, service, and sociodemographic. Twenty five local communities (suburbs) across Australia were selected based on 'diagonality type' i.e. whether they performed better (off-diagonal positive), worse (off-diagonal negative), or 'as expected' (on-diagonal) on the Australian Early Development Census (AEDC) relative to their socioeconomic profile. The approach was designed to determine replicable and modifiable factors that were separate to socioeconomic status. Between 2015-2017, stakeholder interviews (n = 146), parent and service provider focus groups (n = 51), and existing socio-economic and early childhood education and care administrative data were collected. Qualitative and quantitative data analyses were undertaken to understand differences between 14 paired disadvantaged local communities (i.e. on versus off-diagonal). Further analysis of qualitative data elicited important factors for all 25 local communities. From this, we developed a draft set of 'Foundational Community Factors' (FCFs); these are the factors that lay the foundations of a good community for young children."
https://openalex.org/W3198895888,"Volunteers have played an important role by supporting essential services that have been overwhelmed during the most critical moments of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Hence, nonprofit organizations may be interested in preventing negative consequences of these volunteers’ exposure to potentially traumatic events. The aim of this cross-sectional study was twofold. First, to examine to what extent self-compassion and self-determination would contribute to differentiating between volunteers with different levels of compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and post-traumatic growth. Second, to identify the best predictors of the most extreme levels of each outcome. Participants were 211 Spanish Red Cross volunteers (60.7% women), who completed a survey. They were separately classified into three groups (low, medium, and high) according to the 33rd and 66th percentile scores on each outcome (compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and post-traumatic growth). Univariate analyses of variance and post-hoc comparisons revealed that self-compassion and self-determination contributed differently to distinguishing between levels of each outcome. Volunteers lowest in compassion fatigue stood out for showing fewer non-compassionate strategies and more mindfulness than the other groups. Moreover, those higher in satisfaction compassion also showed lower use of unhealthy strategies and higher scores in all other predictive variables. Volunteers highest in post-traumatic growth showed higher self-kindness and satisfaction of all psychological needs. Binary logistic regressions allowed for the identification of predictors of belonging to the most extreme groups. The protective factors may be useful to guide volunteers’ self-care and help them thrive in the face of critical service demands."
https://openalex.org/W3197455905,"There is an increased risk of stroke in patients with cancer-this risk is particularly heightened around the time of cancer diagnosis, although no studies have systematically quantified this risk in the literature. Patients newly diagnosed with cancer without prior stroke represent a highly susceptible population in whom there is a window of opportunity to study and implement primary prevention strategies. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to identify the cumulative incidence of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes during the first year after a diagnosis of cancer.MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed will be searched with the assistance from a medical information specialist, from 1980 until present. Eligible studies will include observational studies that have enrolled adult patients newly diagnosed with cancer and report outcomes of stroke during the first year of cancer diagnosis. We will exclude all randomized and non-randomized interventional studies. Data on participant characteristics, study design, baseline characteristics, and outcome characteristics will be extracted. Study quality will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies, and heterogeneity will be assessed using the I2 statistic. Pooled cumulative incidence will be calculated for ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes separately using a random-effects model.No formal research ethics approval is necessary as primary data collection will not be done. We will disseminate our findings through scientific conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and social media/the press. The findings from this review will inform clinicians and patients regarding the risk of stroke in patients newly diagnosed with cancer by quantifying the cumulative incidence of each subtype of stroke during the first year after a diagnosis of cancer. This represents a window of opportunity to implement prevention strategies in a susceptible population.osf.io/ucwy9."

Antibody testing is an option for case management and epidemiologic studies, with high specificity and variable sensitivity. However, characteristics of local populations may affect performance of these tests. For this reason, the National Institute of Health (INS) and regulatory agencies in Colombia require verification of diagnostic accuracy of tests introduced to the Colombian market.We conducted a validation study of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 test for qualitative detection of IgG using the Abbott Architect i2000SR. Participants and retrospective samples were included from patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, age ≥18 years, and ≥8 days elapsed since initiation of symptoms. Pre-pandemic plasma samples (taken before October 2019) were used as controls. We estimated the sensitivity, specificity and agreement (kappa) of the Abbott IgG test compared to the gold standard (RT-PCR).The overall sensitivity was 83.1% (95% CI: 75.4-100). Sensitivity among patients with ≥14 days since the start of symptoms was 85.7%, reaching 88% in samples collected from patients with COVID-19 symptoms onset >60 days. Specificity was 100% and the kappa index of agreement was 0.804 (95% CI: 0.642-0.965).Our findings show high sensitivity and specificity of the Abbott IgG test in a Colombian population, which meet the criteria set by the Colombian INS to aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Data from our patient groups also suggest that IgG response is detectable in a high proportion of individuals (88.1%) during the first two months following onset of symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3198099184,"Land prices are the key problem of urban land management, with prices of residential land being the most sensitive and the strongest social reflection among the different land types. Exploring spatial and temporal variation of residential land prices and the effect of land market factors on residential land prices can help the government formulate targeted regulations and policies. This study analyzes the spatial and temporal evolution of residential land prices and the factors influencing the land market in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region based on land transaction data from 2014-2017 using exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The results show the following: ① Residential land prices in Beijing and Tianjin are significantly higher than those in other regions, while Zhangjiakou, Chengde, and western mountainous areas have the lowest residential land prices. Over time, a development trend of residential land price polycentricity gradually emerged, and the locational correlation has gradually increased. ② Under the influence of the land finance model of local governments in China, three factors, namely, the land stock utilization rate, revenue from residential land transfers, and the growth of residential land transaction areas, have significantly contributed to the increase in residential land prices. ③ Under the land market supply and demand mechanism and government management, four indicators, namely, the land supply rate, the per capita residential land supply area, the degree of marketization of the residential land supply, and the frequency of residential land transactions, have suppressed the rise in residential land prices. ④ The overall effect of land market factors on residential land prices in the central and northern regions of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei is stronger than that in the southern regions, which may be related to the more active land market and stricter macromanagement policies in Beijing, Tianjin and surrounding areas."

The effectiveness of different shape descriptors (area/perimeter, fractal area, circularity, maximum fractal, rectangularity, multiscale fractal curve-MFC), and the concatenation of all shape descriptors (except MFC), denominated Alldescriptors (AllD)) was evaluated and applied to polygons corresponding to the shapes represented by the convex hull obtained from players' 2D coordinates. A content-based image retrieval system (CBIR) was applied for 25 users (mean age of 31.9 ± 8.4 years) to evaluate the relevant images. Measures of effectiveness were used to evaluate the shape descriptors (P@n and R@n). The MFD (P@5, 0.46±0.37 and P@10, 0.40±0.31, p < 0.001; R@5, 0.14±0.13 and R@10, 0.24±0.19, p < 0.001) and AllD (P@5 = 0.43±0.36 and P@10 = 0.39±0.32, p < 0.001; R@5 = 0.13±0.11 and R@10 = 0.24±0.20, p < 0.001) descriptors presented higher values of effectiveness. As a practical demonstration, the best evaluated shape descriptor (MFC) was applied for tactical analysis of an official match. K-means clustering technique was applied, and different shapes of organization could be identified throughout the match. The MFC was the most effective shape descriptor in relation to all others, making it possible to apply this descriptor in the analysis of professional football matches."

Data were obtained from the medical records of patients who underwent reconstructive surgery at the Division of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital between 2014 and 2018. All eligible patients were referred to participate in this study between November 2018 and March 2019. The hearing function was assessed by a professional audiologist after surgery. Patient satisfaction was evaluated by interview using a previously developed questionnaire, while quality of life was assessed using the EuroQol-5D-Young questionnaire.Thirty-one eligible subjects were included in the study. Pain and discomfort were the most commonly reported factors related to the quality of life following surgery. Approximately 67.7% of the patients were satisfied; 19.4% were very satisfied, and 12.9% reported acceptance of their surgical outcomes. The most common complication was infection (n = 8). Most patients did not experience any problems in their lives after microtia surgery.The highest rate of satisfactory outcomes was observed for the lobule subunit, which was assumed to be associated with the use of the Z-plasty technique. The most common complication was infection, as environmental hygiene was the most important factor. Thus, further concern for maintaining good hygiene is necessary to improve the quality of reconstructive surgery. The level of satisfaction with microtia reconstructive surgery was adequate. Most patients had a good health-related quality of life without experiencing any problems."

However, the availability of feedback tools for consumers to evaluate the cleanliness of a restaurant is a crucial issue as several aspects of cleanliness need to be evaluated collectively. To overcome this issue, this study designed a survey instrument based on the standard form used for grading the food premises and transformed it into a seven Likert scale questionnaire and consists of seven questions. This study employed fuzzy conjoint analysis to measure the level of satisfaction in cleanliness in food premises. This pilot study recruited 30 students in Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Seremban 3. The student's perception was represented by the scores calculated based on their degree of similarities and corresponding levels of satisfaction, whereby, only scores with the highest degree of similarity were selected. Furthermore, this study identified the aspects of hygiene that assessed based on the customers' satisfaction upon visiting the premises. The results indicated that the fuzzy conjoint analysis produced a similar outcome as the statistical mean, thus, was useful for the evaluation of customer satisfaction on the cleanliness of food premises."

Therefore, the impacts of 34-years different long-term fertilization system on soil N-fixing bacteria community under the double-cropping rice paddy field in southern of China were investigated by taken chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) method in this paper. The field experiment were set up four different fertilizer treatments: chemical fertilizer alone (MF), rice straw and chemical fertilizer (RF), 30% organic manure and 70% chemical fertilizer (OM), and unfertilized as a control (CK). This results showed that compared with CK treatment, the diversity index of cbbLR and nifH genes with OM and RF treatments were significantly increased (p<0.05), respectively. Meanwhile, the abundance of cbbLR gene with OM, RF and MF treatments were increased by 23.94, 12.19 and 6.70×107 copies g-1 compared to CK treatment, respectively. Compared with CK treatment, the abundance of nifH gene with OM, RF and MF treatments were increased by 23.90, 8.82 and 5.40×109 copies g-1, respectively. This results indicated that compared with CK treatment, the soil autotrophic azotobacter and nitrogenase activities with OM and RF treatments were also significantly increased (p<0.05), respectively. There were an obvious difference in features of soil N-fixing bacteria community between application of inorganic fertilizer and organic manure treatments. Therefore, this results demonstrated that abundance of soil N-fixing bacteria community in the double-cropping rice paddy field were increased by long-term applied with organic manure and crop residue managements."
https://openalex.org/W3197348180,"Palliative care is still a new concept in many developing countries like Bangladesh. Basic knowledge about palliative care is needed for all physicians to identify and provide this care. This study aims to assess the preliminary knowledge level and the misconceptions about this field among physicians.This cross-sectional study was conducted among 479 physicians using a self-administered structured questionnaire adapted from Palliative Care Knowledge Scale (PaCKs) on various digital social media platforms from December 2019 to February 2020. Chi-square, Fisher's extract test, and the Monte Carlo extract test was done to compare the knowledge level with the study subjects' demographic variables.An almost equal number of physicians of both genders from four major specialties and their allied branches took part in the study (response rate 23.9%). The majority (71%) of the respondents had an average to an excellent level of knowledge about palliative care, with a median score of 11.0. Although most physicians had average knowledge about the primary goals and general concepts of palliative care, misconceptions are highly prevalent. The commonly present misconceptions were that palliative care discourages patients from consulting other specialties (88.9%), refrains them from taking curative treatments (83.1%), and this care is only for older adults (74.5%), cancer patients (63%), and the last six months of life (56.4%). Age, educational qualifications, and specialties had significant relationships (P<0.05) with the level of knowledge.Despite having average or above knowledge about palliative care, the physicians' prevailing misconceptions act as a barrier to recognizing the need among the target populations. So, proper education and awareness among the physicians are necessary to cross this field's barrier and development."
https://openalex.org/W3197728610,"Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is highly effective in preventing disease progression of rabies when used in timely and appropriate manner. The key treatment for PEP is infiltration of rabies immune globulin (RIG) into lesion site after bite exposure, besides wound care and vaccination. Unfortunately, however, RIG is expensive and its supply is limited. Currently, several anti-rabies virus monoclonal antibody (mAb) products are under development as alternatives to RIG, and two recently received regulatory approval in India. In this study, fully human mAbs that recognize different rabies virus glycoprotein conformational antigenic site (II and III) were created from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of heathy vaccinated subjects. These mAbs neutralized a diverse range of lyssavirus types. As at least two anti-rabies virus mAbs are recommended for use in human PEP to ensure broad coverage against diverse lyssaviruses and to minimize possible escape variants, two most potent mAbs, NP-19-9 and 11B6, were selected to be used as cocktail treatment. These two mAbs were broadly reactive to different types of lyssaviruses isolates, and were shown to have no interference with each other. These results suggest that NP-19-9 and 11B6 are potent candidates to be used for PEP, suggesting further studies involving clinical studies in human."
https://openalex.org/W3098797529,"Bayes' Theorem imposes inevitable limitations on the accuracy of screening tests by tying the test's predictive value to the disease prevalence. The aforementioned limitation is independent of the adequacy and make-up of the test and thus implies inherent Bayesian limitations to the screening process itself. As per the WHO's Wilson - Jungner criteria, one of the prerequisite steps before undertaking screening is to ensure that a treatment for the condition screened for exists. However, when applying screening programs in closed systems, a paradox, henceforth termed the ""screening paradox"", ensues. If a disease process is screened for and subsequently treated, its prevalence would drop in the population, which as per Bayes' theorem, would make the tests' predictive value drop in return. Put another way, a very powerful screening test would, by performing and succeeding at the very task it was developed to do, paradoxically reduce its ability to correctly identify individuals with the disease it screens for in the future-over some time t. In this manuscript, we explore the mathematical model which formalizes said screening paradox and explore its implications for population level screening programs. In particular, we define the number of positive test iterations (PTI) needed to reverse the effects of the paradox. Given their theoretical nature, clinical application of the concepts herein reported need validation prior to implementation. Meanwhile, an understanding of how the dynamics of prevalence can affect the PPV over time can help inform clinicians as to the reliability of a screening test's results."

The methylation patterns of HPV16 genes, including the early promoter (CpG 31, 37, 43, 52, and 58) and L1 genes (CpG 5600, 5606, 5609, 5615, 7136, and 7145), were analyzed in 178 anal samples. The samples were diagnosed as normal, anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) 1, AIN2, and AIN3. Low methylation levels of the early promoter (< 10%) and L1 genes (< 20%) were found in all detected normal anal cells. In comparison, medium to high methylation (≥ 20-60%) in the early promoter was found in 1.5% (1/67) and 5% (2/40) of AIN1 and AIN2-3 samples, respectively. Interestingly, slightly increased L1 gene methylation levels (≥ 20-60%), especially at the HPV16 5'L1 regions CpGs 5600 and 5609, were demonstrated in AIN2-3 specimen. Moreover, a negative correlation between high HPV16 L1 gene methylation at CpGs 5600, 5609, 5615, and 7145 and a percentual CD4 count was found in AIN3 HIV positive cases. When comparing the methylation status of AIN2-3 to that of normal/AIN1 lesions, the results indicated the potential of using HPV16 L1 gene methylation as a biomarker for HPV-related cancer screening."
https://openalex.org/W3196725675,"The elimination of hazardous compounds in chemical wastes can be a complex and technically demanding task. In the search for environmental-friendly technologies, fungal mediated remediation and removal procedures are of concern. In this study, we investigated whether there are fungal species that can survive and grow on solely amine-containing compounds. One compound containing a primary amine group; 2-diethylaminoethanol, one compound with a primary amide group; 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM), and a third compound containing a quaternary ammonium group; N3-trimethyl(2-oxiranyl)methanaminium chloride, were selected. The choice of these compounds was motivated by their excessive use in large scale manufacturing of protein separation media (2-diethylaminoethanol and the quaternary amine). 2,6-dichlorobenzamide, the degradation product of the herbicide 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil), was chosen since it is an extremely recalcitrant compound. Utilising part of the large fungal diversity in Northern European forests, a screening study using 48 fungal isolates from 42 fungal species, including saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi, was performed to test for growth responses to the chosen compounds. The ericoid (ERM) mycorrhizal fungus Rhizoscyphus ericae showed the best overall growth on 2-diethylaminoethanol and BAM in the 1-20 g L-1 concentration range, with a 35-fold and 4.5-fold increase in biomass, respectively. For N3-trimethyl(2-oxiranyl)methanaminium chloride, the peak growth occurred at 1 g L-1. In a second experiment, including three of the most promising fungi (Laccaria laccata, Hygrophorus camarophyllus and Rhizoscyphus ericae) from the screening experiment, a simulated process water containing 1.9% (w/v) 2-diethylaminoethanol and 0.8% (w/v) N3-trimethyl(2-oxiranyl)methanaminium chloride was used. Laccaria laccata showed the best biomass increase (380%) relative to a control, while the accumulation for Rhizoscyphus ericae and Hygrophorus camarophyllus were 292% and 136% respectively, indicating that mycorrhizal fungi can use amine- and amide-containing substrates as nutrients.

https://openalex.org/W3196866696,"Tumor ulceration is considered one of the most prognostically significant findings in primary cutaneous melanoma, associated with decreased disease-free and overall survival. However, the unique features associated with ulcerated melanoma that contribute to a poor prognosis in affected patients remain poorly defined. microRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that function to inhibit expression of specific gene targets, therefore altering the functions of cells in which they are expressed. miR-1469 is a novel miR with significantly decreased expression in ulcerated melanoma tissue relative to non-ulcerated tumors. We hypothesized that loss of miR-1469 expression in melanoma contributes to altered tumor cell functions mediating disease progression. Transfection of a miR-1469 mimic resulted in a significant reduction in the migratory and invasive capacity of the CHL1 and MEL39 melanoma cell lines (>58.1% reduction, p < 0.0332), as well as the invasive capacity of the A375 melanoma cell line (>50% reduction, p < 0.0021). Expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1), a miR-1469 target gene, was reduced in the A375 and MEL39 cell lines by immunoblot. No significant differences in viability, resistance to apoptotic stimuli, or proliferation were observed following transfection. These findings together demonstrate how migration and invasion are specific functions through which miR-1469 expression in melanoma cells can contribute to the differences in disease progression associated with tumor ulceration."
https://openalex.org/W3197446405,"Patients with mental disorders often suffer from comorbidity. Transdiagnostic understandings of mental disorders are expected to provide more accurate and detailed descriptions of psychopathology and be helpful in developing efficient treatments. Although conventional clustering techniques, such as latent profile analysis, are useful for the taxonomy of psychopathology, they provide little implications for targeting specific symptoms in each cluster. To overcome these limitations, we introduced Gaussian graphical mixture model (GGMM)-based clustering, a method developed in mathematical statistics to integrate clustering and network statistical approaches. To illustrate the technical details and clinical utility of the analysis, we applied GGMM-based clustering to a Japanese sample of 1,521 patients (Mage = 42.42 years), who had diagnostic labels of major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 406), panic disorder (PD; n = 198), social anxiety disorder (SAD; n = 116), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n = 66), comorbid MDD and any anxiety disorder (n = 636), or comorbid anxiety disorders (n = 99). As a result, we identified the following four transdiagnostic clusters characterized by i) strong OCD and PD symptoms, and moderate MDD and SAD symptoms; ii) moderate MDD, PD, and SAD symptoms, and weak OCD symptoms; iii) weak symptoms of all four disorders; and iv) strong symptoms of all four disorders. Simultaneously, a covariance symptom network within each cluster was visualized. The discussion highlighted that the GGMM-based clusters help us generate clinical hypotheses for transdiagnostic clusters by enabling further investigations of each symptom network, such as the calculation of centrality indexes."

However, the throughput of this system is low which limits the number of compounds that can be tested per animal. We developed instrumentation and software that can automatically find adult cardiomyocytes. Cells are detected based on the cell boundary using a Sobel-filter to find the edge information in the field of view. Separately, we detected motion by calculating the variance of intensity for each pixel in the frame through time. Additionally, it detects the best region for calcium and contractility measurements. A sensitivity of 0.66 ± 0.08 and a precision of 0.82 ± 0.03 was reached using our cell finding algorithm. The percentage of cells that were found and had good contractility measurements was 90 ± 10%. In addition, the average time between 2 cardiomyocyte calcium and contractility measurements decreased from 93.5 ± 80.2 to 15.6 ± 8.0 seconds using our software and microscope. This drastically increases throughput and provides a higher statistical reliability when performing adult cardiomyocyte functional experiments."

We also investigated the effects of reduced IGF-I availability using mice lacking PAPP-A2, a protease of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP-5).In 2 month old mice, lactation affected femoral trabecular and cortical bone, but only cortical bone showed recovery 3 weeks after weaning. This recovery was not affected by deletion of the Pappa2 gene. The amount of trabecular bone was reduced in 5 and 7 month old mice, and was not further reduced by lactation. However, the recovery of cortical bone was impaired at 5 and 7 months compared with at 2 months.Recovery of the maternal skeleton after lactation is impaired in moderately-aged mice compared with younger mice. Our results may be relevant to the long-term effects of breastfeeding on the maternal skeleton in humans, particularly given the increasing median maternal age at childbearing."
https://openalex.org/W3198471827,"People can exhibit their status by the consumption of particular goods or experiential purchases; this is known as ""conspicuous consumption""; the practice is widespread and explains the market characteristics of a whole class of goods, Veblen goods, demand for which increase in tandem with their price. The value of such positional goods lies in their distribution among the population-the rarer they are, the more desirable they become. At the same time, higher income, often associated with higher status, has been studied in its relation to unethical behavior. Here we present research that shows how a particular Veblen good, illicit behavior, and wealth, combine to produce the display of illegality as a status symbol. We gathered evidence at a large, country-level, scale of a particular form of consumption of an illictly acquired good for status purposes. We show that in Greece, a developed middle-income country, where authorities cannot issue custom vanity license plates, people acquire distinguishing plate numbers that act as vanity plate surrogates. We found that such license plates are more common in cars with bigger engines and in luxury brands, and are therefore associated with higher value vehicles. This cannot be explained under the lawful procedures for allocating license plates and must therefore be the result of illegal activities, such as graft. This suggests a pattern of ""conspicuous corruption"", where individuals break the law and use their gains as status symbols, knowing that the symbols hint at rule-breaking, as long as the unlawful practice cannot be incontestably established."
https://openalex.org/W3197614102,"Dexterous use of the hands depends critically on sensory feedback, so it is generally agreed that functional supplementary feedback would greatly improve the use of hand prostheses. Much research still focuses on improving non-invasive feedback that could potentially become available to all prosthesis users. However, few studies on supplementary tactile feedback for hand prostheses demonstrated a functional benefit. We suggest that confounding factors impede accurate assessment of feedback, e.g., testing non-amputee participants that inevitably focus intently on learning EMG control, the EMG’s susceptibility to noise and delays, and the limited dexterity of hand prostheses. In an attempt to assess the effect of feedback free from these constraints, we used silicone digit extensions to suppress natural tactile feedback from the fingertips and thus used the tactile feedback-deprived human hand as an approximation of an ideal feed-forward tool. Our non-amputee participants wore the extensions and performed a simple pick-and-lift task with known weight, followed by a more difficult pick-and-lift task with changing weight. They then repeated these tasks with one of three kinds of audio feedback. The tests were repeated over three days. We also conducted a similar experiment on a person with severe sensory neuropathy to test the feedback without the extensions. Furthermore, we used a questionnaire based on the NASA Task Load Index to gauge the subjective experience. Unexpectedly, we did not find any meaningful differences between the feedback groups, neither in the objective nor the subjective measurements. It is possible that the digit extensions did not fully suppress sensation, but since the participant with impaired sensation also did not improve with the supplementary feedback, we conclude that the feedback failed to provide relevant grasping information in our experiments. The study highlights the complex interaction between task, feedback variable, feedback delivery, and control, which seemingly rendered even rich, high-bandwidth acoustic feedback redundant, despite substantial sensory impairment."

https://openalex.org/W3198900751,"Microdialysis is a minimally invasive sampling technique which is widely applied in many fields including clinical studies. This technique usually has limitation on sampling hydrophobic compounds as aqueous solutions are commonly used as the perfusates. The relative recovery of hydrophobic compounds is often low and irreproducible because of the non-specific binding to microdialysis membranes or catheter tubing. Carriers such as cyclodextrins have been used to improve the recovery and consistency, however the identification of an optimal carrier can only be achieved after time-consuming and costly microdialysis experiments. We therefore developed a rapid, convenient, and low-cost method to identify the optimal carriers for sampling hydrophobic compounds with the use of centrifugal ultrafiltration. Doxorubicin was used as the model compound and its relative recoveries obtained from centrifugal ultrafiltration and from microdialysis were compared. The results show that the relative recoveries are highly correlated (correlation coefficient ≥ 0.9) between centrifugal ultrafiltration and microdialysis when different types or different concentrations of cyclodextrins were used as the carriers. In addition to doxorubicin, this method was further confirmed on three other drugs with different hydrophobicity. This method may facilitate and broaden the use of microdialysis perfusion on sampling or delivering hydrophobic substances in various applications."
