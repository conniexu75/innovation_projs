https://openalex.org/W2901272595,"Programmed cell death protein-1/ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) blockade is effective in a subset of patients with several tumor types, but predicting patient benefit using approved diagnostics is inexact, as some patients with PD-L1-negative tumors also show clinical benefit1,2. Moreover, all biopsy-based tests are subject to the errors and limitations of invasive tissue collection3-11. Preclinical studies of positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging with antibodies to PD-L1 suggested that this imaging method might be an approach to selecting patients12,13. Such a technique, however, requires substantial clinical development and validation. Here we present the initial results from a first-in-human study to assess the feasibility of imaging with zirconium-89-labeled atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1), including biodistribution, and secondly test its potential to predict response to PD-L1 blockade (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT02453984 and NCT02478099). We imaged 22 patients across three tumor types before the start of atezolizumab therapy. The PET signal, a function of tracer exposure and target expression, was high in lymphoid tissues and at sites of inflammation. In tumors, uptake was generally high but heterogeneous, varying within and among lesions, patients, and tumor types. Intriguingly, clinical responses in our patients were better correlated with pretreatment PET signal than with immunohistochemistry- or RNA-sequencing-based predictive biomarkers, encouraging further development of molecular PET imaging for assessment of PD-L1 status and clinical response prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2900498998,"Cellular processes are carried out by many genes, and their study and optimization requires multiple levers by which they can be independently controlled. The most common method is via a genetically encoded sensor that responds to a small molecule. However, these sensors are often suboptimal, exhibiting high background expression and low dynamic range. Further, using multiple sensors in one cell is limited by cross-talk and the taxing of cellular resources. Here, we have developed a directed evolution strategy to simultaneously select for lower background, high dynamic range, increased sensitivity, and low cross-talk. This is applied to generate a set of 12 high-performance sensors that exhibit >100-fold induction with low background and cross-reactivity. These are combined to build a single ""sensor array"" in the genomes of E. coli MG1655 (wild-type), DH10B (cloning), and BL21 (protein expression). These ""Marionette"" strains allow for the independent control of gene expression using 12 small-molecule inducers."
https://openalex.org/W2900290772,"The proteasome is an ATP-dependent, 2.5-megadalton machine responsible for selective protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. Here we present cryo-EM structures of the substrate-engaged human proteasome in seven conformational states at 2.8-3.6 A resolution, captured during breakdown of a polyubiquitylated protein. These structures visualize a continuum of dynamic substrate-proteasome interactions from ubiquitin recognition to substrate translocation, during which ATP hydrolysis sequentially navigates through all six ATPases. Three principal modes of coordinated hydrolysis are observed, featuring hydrolytic events in two oppositely positioned ATPases, in two adjacent ATPases, and in one ATPase at a time. These hydrolytic modes regulate deubiquitylation, translocation initiation and processive unfolding of substrates, respectively. ATP hydrolysis powers a hinge-like motion in each ATPase that regulates its substrate interaction. Synchronization of ATP binding, ADP release and ATP hydrolysis in three adjacent ATPases drives rigid-body rotations of substrate-bound ATPases that are propagated unidirectionally in the ATPase ring and unfold the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2951079876,"We introduce new statistical methods for analyzing genomic data sets that measure many effects in many conditions (for example, gene expression changes under many treatments). These new methods improve on existing methods by allowing for arbitrary correlations in effect sizes among conditions. This flexible approach increases power, improves effect estimates and allows for more quantitative assessments of effect-size heterogeneity compared to simple shared or condition-specific assessments. We illustrate these features through an analysis of locally acting variants associated with gene expression (cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)) in 44 human tissues. Our analysis identifies more eQTLs than existing approaches, consistent with improved power. We show that although genetic effects on expression are extensively shared among tissues, effect sizes can still vary greatly among tissues. Some shared eQTLs show stronger effects in subsets of biologically related tissues (for example, brain-related tissues), or in only one tissue (for example, testis). Our methods are widely applicable, computationally tractable for many conditions and available online."
https://openalex.org/W2901591386,"Although targeted therapies often elicit profound initial patient responses, these effects are transient due to residual disease leading to acquired resistance. How tumors transition between drug responsiveness, tolerance and resistance, especially in the absence of preexisting subclones, remains unclear. In epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cells, we demonstrate that residual disease and acquired resistance in response to EGFR inhibitors requires Aurora kinase A (AURKA) activity. Nongenetic resistance through the activation of AURKA by its coactivator TPX2 emerges in response to chronic EGFR inhibition where it mitigates drug-induced apoptosis. Aurora kinase inhibitors suppress this adaptive survival program, increasing the magnitude and duration of EGFR inhibitor response in preclinical models. Treatment-induced activation of AURKA is associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitors in vitro, in vivo and in most individuals with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. These findings delineate a molecular path whereby drug resistance emerges from drug-tolerant cells and unveils a synthetic lethal strategy for enhancing responses to EGFR inhibitors by suppressing AURKA-driven residual disease and acquired resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2900950647,"Understanding the mechanisms underlying autoantibody development will accelerate therapeutic target identification in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)1. Follicular helper T cells (TFH cells) have long been implicated in SLE pathogenesis. Yet a fraction of autoantibodies in individuals with SLE are unmutated, supporting that autoreactive B cells also differentiate outside germinal centers2. Here, we describe a CXCR5-CXCR3+ programmed death 1 (PD1)hiCD4+ helper T cell population distinct from TFH cells and expanded in both SLE blood and the tubulointerstitial areas of individuals with proliferative lupus nephritis. These cells produce interleukin-10 (IL-10) and accumulate mitochondrial reactive oxygen species as the result of reverse electron transport fueled by succinate. Furthermore, they provide B cell help, independently of IL-21, through IL-10 and succinate. Similar cells are generated in vitro upon priming naive CD4+ T cells with plasmacytoid dendritic cells activated with oxidized mitochondrial DNA, a distinct class of interferogenic toll-like receptor 9 ligand3. Targeting this pathway might blunt the initiation and/or perpetuation of extrafollicular humoral responses in SLE."
https://openalex.org/W2900803145,"Reward drives motivated behaviours and is essential for survival, and therefore there is strong evolutionary pressure to retain contextual information about rewarding stimuli. This drive may be abnormally strong, such as in addiction, or weak, such as in depression, in which anhedonia (loss of pleasure in response to rewarding stimuli) is a prominent symptom. Hippocampal input to the shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is important for driving NAc activity1,2 and activity-dependent modulation of the strength of this input may contribute to the proper regulation of goal-directed behaviours. However, there have been few robust descriptions of the mechanisms that underlie the induction or expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) at these synapses, and there is, to our knowledge, no evidence about whether such plasticity contributes to reward-related behaviour. Here we show that high-frequency activity induces LTP at hippocampus-NAc synapses in mice via canonical, but dopamine-independent, mechanisms. The induction of LTP at this synapse in vivo drives conditioned place preference, and activity at this synapse is required for conditioned place preference in response to a natural reward. Conversely, chronic stress, which induces anhedonia, decreases the strength of this synapse and impairs LTP, whereas antidepressant treatment is accompanied by a reversal of these stress-induced changes. We conclude that hippocampus-NAc synapses show activity-dependent plasticity and suggest that their strength may be critical for contextual reward behaviour."

https://openalex.org/W2903562030,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are distinct clinical syndromes characterized by the pathological accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) protein fibrils in neurons and glial cells. These disorders and other neurodegenerative diseases may progress via prion-like mechanisms. The prion model of propagation predicts the existence of “strains” that link pathological aggregate structure and neuropathology. Prion strains are aggregated conformers that stably propagate in vivo and cause disease with defined incubation times and patterns of neuropathology. Indeed, tau prions have been well defined, and research suggests that both α-syn and β-amyloid may also form strains. However, there is a lack of studies characterizing PD- versus MSA-derived α-syn strains or demonstrating stable propagation of these unique conformers between cells or animals. To fill this gap, we used an assay based on FRET that exploits a HEK293T “biosensor” cell line stably expressing α-syn (A53T)-CFP/YFP fusion proteins to detect α-syn seeds in brain extracts from PD and MSA patients. Both soluble and insoluble fractions of MSA extracts had robust seeding activity, whereas only the insoluble fractions of PD extracts displayed seeding activity. The morphology of MSA-seeded inclusions differed from PD-seeded inclusions. These differences persisted upon propagation of aggregation to second-generation biosensor cells. We conclude that PD and MSA feature α-syn conformers with very distinct biochemical properties that can be transmitted to α-syn monomers in a cell system. These findings are consistent with the idea that distinct α-syn strains underlie PD and MSA and offer possible directions for synucleinopathy diagnosis.

To compare and contrast PD and MSA α-syn seeds, we have used an established cell-based assay to test for self-propagating structures that exhibit unique biochemical characteristics. To detect α-syn seeding activity, we have previously created biosensor cell lines based on α-syn fusion to cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins (α-syn-CFP/YFP) (50Holmes B.B. Furman J.L. Mahan T.E.

We determined empirically that A53T creates the most effective biosensor for recombinant α-syn fibril detection by comparing it to WT α-syn (Fig. 1A). Hereafter, we refer to the α-syn (A53T) protein in the biosensor line simply as α-syn-CFP/YFP. α-Syn-CFP/YFP does not spontaneously aggregate within cells. But these cells will take up exogenous recombinant α-syn seeds that will subsequently trigger intracellular aggregation of the α-syn-CFP/YFP biosensor proteins. This can be directly visualized by epifluorescence microscopy, or quantified via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (50Holmes B.B. Furman J.L. Mahan T.E. Yamasaki T.R. Mirbaha H.

In the FRET flow cytometry assay, we determined a lower limit for detection of 1 pm (monomer equivalent) recombinant α-syn fibrils (Fig. 1B). Exposure of cells to fibrils prepared from synthetic Aβ(1–42) and recombinant tau did not generate any signal by FRET flow cytometry, or visible inclusions via fluorescence microscopy, even at 10,000-fold over the detection limit for α-syn fibrils (Fig. 1, C and D). Although application of fibrils alone triggered seeding in the biosensor cells, addition of Lipofectamine strongly increased seeding (Fig. 1E). Consequently, we used this agent in our subsequent experiments. Prior reports have indicated that brain extract from MSA, but not PD, contains α-syn seeding activity (26Watts J.C. Giles K. Oehler A.

We used the α-syn-CFP/YFP biosensor cell line to test for seeding activity in postmortem brain tissue from both PD (n = 5) and MSA (n = 5) cases. We evaluated regions previously determined to have abundant α-syn pathology based on histopathological analyses by a neuropathologist (N. J. C.). In PD, the anterior cingulate gyrus (AC) and amygdala (Am) contain high levels of neuronal α-syn pathology, including Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites (Fig. 2A). In MSA, the cerebellum (Cb) and basal ganglia (BG) exhibit abundant inclusions (Papp-Lantos bodies) in oligodendrocytes and in white matter tracts (Fig. 2A). Neuropathological characteristics of all PD, MSA, and control patients are detailed in Table 1. Prior to the analysis of seeding activity using the FRET biosensor system, we sequentially extracted tissue samples according to previously described methods (52Bagchi D.P. Yu L. Perlmutter J.S.

We began with homogenization in high salt buffer without detergent, followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g to generate the “buffer-soluble” fraction. We then homogenized the pellet in buffers containing 1% Triton X-100, with a wash step, followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g to generate the “detergent-insoluble” fraction (see “Experimental procedures” for details). The detergent-insoluble fractions of both PD and MSA contained α-syn seeding activity detected by the FRET biosensor assay, with higher levels in MSA brain tissue samples (Fig. 2, B and C). Seeding activity correlated between regions for each of the patients examined, i.e. brains with high seeding in amygdala also had high seeding in the anterior cingulate, and vice versa.

After validating our model using simulations, we applied StructLMM to body mass index in the UK Biobank, where our model yields previously known and novel G×E signals.

https://openalex.org/W2901033899,"DNA methylation and Polycomb are key factors in the establishment of vertebrate cellular identity and fate. Here we report de novo missense mutations in DNMT3A, which encodes the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A. These mutations cause microcephalic dwarfism, a hypocellular disorder of extreme global growth failure. Substitutions in the PWWP domain abrogate binding to the histone modifications H3K36me2 and H3K36me3, and alter DNA methylation in patient cells. Polycomb-associated DNA methylation valleys, hypomethylated domains encompassing developmental genes, become methylated with concomitant depletion of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 bivalent marks. Such de novo DNA methylation occurs during differentiation of Dnmt3aW326R pluripotent cells in vitro, and is also evident in Dnmt3aW326R/+ dwarf mice. We therefore propose that the interaction of the DNMT3A PWWP domain with H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 normally limits DNA methylation of Polycomb-marked regions. Our findings implicate the interplay between DNA methylation and Polycomb at key developmental regulators as a determinant of organism size in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2900452086,"Treatment of prostate cancer (PC) by androgen suppression promotes the emergence of aggressive variants that are androgen receptor (AR) independent. Here we identify the transcription factor ONECUT2 (OC2) as a master regulator of AR networks in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). OC2 acts as a survival factor in mCRPC models, suppresses the AR transcriptional program by direct regulation of AR target genes and the AR licensing factor FOXA1, and activates genes associated with neural differentiation and progression to lethal disease. OC2 appears active in a substantial subset of human prostate adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors. Inhibition of OC2 by a newly identified small molecule suppresses metastasis in mice. These findings suggest that OC2 displaces AR-dependent growth and survival mechanisms in many cases where AR remains expressed, but where its activity is bypassed. OC2 is also a potential drug target in the metastatic phase of aggressive PC. ONECUT2 is a targetable transcription factor that antagonizes androgen receptor signaling and drives androgen independence and neuroendocrine differentiation in castration-resistant prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2901749533,"Physical interaction of regulatory elements in three-dimensional space poses a challenge for studies of disease because non-coding risk variants may be great distances from the genes they regulate. Experimental methods to capture these interactions, such as chromosome conformation capture, usually cannot assign causal direction of effect between regulatory elements, an important component of fine-mapping studies. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical approach that uses two-stage least squares and applied it to an ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) data set from 100 individuals, to identify over 15,000 high-confidence causal interactions. Most (60%) interactions occurred over <20 kb, where chromosome conformation capture-based methods perform poorly. For a fraction of loci, we identified a single variant that alters accessibility across multiple regions, and experimentally validated the BLK locus, which is associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, using CRISPR genome editing. Our study highlights how association genetics of chromatin state is a powerful approach for identifying interactions between regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W2902298148,"Serine-arginine (SR) proteins are essential splicing factors containing a canonical RNA recognition motif (RRM), sometimes followed by a pseudo-RRM, and a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain that undergoes multisite phosphorylation. Phosphorylation regulates the localization and activity of SR proteins, and thus may provide insight into their differential biological roles. The phosphorylation mechanism of the prototypic SRSF1 by serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) has been well-studied, but little is known about the phosphorylation of other SR protein members. In the present study, interaction and kinetic assays unveiled how SRSF1 and the single RRM–containing SRSF3 are phosphorylated by SRPK2, another member of the SRPK family. We showed that a conserved SRPK-specific substrate-docking groove in SRPK2 impacts the binding and phosphorylation of both SR proteins, and the localization of SRSF3. We identified a nonconserved residue within the groove that affects the kinase processivity. We demonstrated that, in contrast to SRSF1, for which SRPK-mediated phosphorylation is confined to the N-terminal region of the RS domain, SRSF3 phosphorylation sites are spread throughout its entire RS domain in vitro. Despite this, SRSF3 appears to be hypophosphorylated in cells at steady state. Our results suggest that the absence of a pseudo-RRM renders the single RRM–containing SRSF3 more susceptible to dephosphorylation by phosphatase. These findings suggest that the single RRM– and two RRM–containing SR proteins represent two subclasses of phosphoproteins in which phosphorylation statuses are maintained by unique mechanisms, and pose new directions to explore the distinct roles of SR proteins in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2902166192,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects up to 15% of the adult population and is strongly associated with other non-communicable chronic diseases including diabetes. However, there is limited information on a population basis of the relationship between CKD and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the consequent economic cost. We investigated this relationship in a representative sample in England using the 2010 Health Survey for England. Multivariable Tobit models were used to examine the relationship between HRQoL and CKD severity. HRQoL was converted to quality adjusted life year (QALY) measures by combining decrements in quality of life with reductions in life expectancy associated with increased disease severity. QALYs were adjusted for discounting and monetised using the UK threshold for reimbursement of £30,000. The QALYs were then used in conjunction with forecasted prevalence to estimate the HRQoL burden associated with CKD among individuals with diabetes up to 2025. Individuals with more severe CKD had lower HRQoL compared to those with better kidney function. Compared to those with normal/low normal kidney function and stage 1 CKD, those with stage 2, stage 3 with albuminuria and stage 4/5 CKD experienced a decrement of 0.11, 0.18 and 0.28 in their utility index, respectively. Applying the UK reimbursement threshold for a QALY, the monetised lifetime burden of reduced HRQoL due to stage 2, stage 3 with albuminuria and stage 4/5 CKD were £103,734; £83,399; £125,335 in males and £143,582; £70,288; £203,804 in females, respectively. Utilizing the predicted prevalence of CKD among individuals with diabetes mellitus, the economic burden of CKD per million of individuals with diabetes is forecasted at approximately £11.4 billion in 2025. In conclusion, CKD has a strong adverse impact on HRQoL in multiple domains. The estimated economic burden of CKD among individuals with diabetes mellitus in the UK is projected to rise markedly over time."

Based on unsupervised classification of whole-genome gene expression profiles, four molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer were recently identified. However, single-driver molecular events specific to these subtypes have not been clearly elucidated. We aim to characterize the regulatory mechanisms underlying the poor prognosis mesenchymal subtype of ovarian cancer using a systems biology approach, involving a variety of molecular modalities including gene and microRNA expression profiles. miR-508-3p emerged as the most powerful determinant that regulates a cascade of dysregulated genes in the mesenchymal subtype, including core genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. Moreover, miR-508-3p down-regulation, due to promoter hypermethylation, was directly correlated with metastatic behaviors in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our multidimensional network analysis identified miR-508-3p as a master regulator that defines the mesenchymal subtype and provides a novel prognostic biomarker to improve management of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2903382759,"Despite emergence of new systemic therapies, metastatic melanoma remains a challenging and often fatal form of skin cancer. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a major physiological regulatory pathway controlling salt-water equilibrium, intravascular volume and blood pressure. Biological effects of the RAS are mediated by the vasoactive hormone angiotensin II (AngII) via two receptor subtypes, AT1R (encoded by AGTR1) and AT2R (encoded by AGTR2). We report decreasing expression and increasing CpG island methylation of AGTR1 in metastatic versus primary melanoma and detection in serum of methylated genomic DNA from the AGTR1 CpG island in metastatic melanoma implying that AGTR1 encodes a tumour suppressor function in melanoma. Consistent with this hypothesis, antagonism of AT1R using losartan or shRNA-mediated knockdown in melanoma cell lines expressing AGTR1 resulted in acquisition of the ability to proliferate in serum-free conditions. Conversely, ectopic expression of AGTR1 in cell lines lacking endogenous expression inhibits proliferation irrespective of the presence of AngII implying a ligand-independent suppressor function for AT1R. Treatment of melanoma cell lines expressing endogenous AT2R with either AngII or the AT2R-selective agonist Y6AII induces proliferation in serum-free conditions whereas the AT2R-specific antagonists PD123319 and EMA401 inhibit melanoma growth and angiogenesis and potentiate inhibitors of BRAF and MEK in cells with BRAF V600 mutations. Our results demonstrate that the RAS has both oncogenic and tumour suppressor functions in melanoma. Pharmacological inhibition of AT2R may provide therapeutic opportunities in melanomas expressing this receptor and AGTR1 CpG island methylation in serum may serve as a novel biomarker of metastatic melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2902549671,"Background Human brucellosis has become a major public health problem in China. However, the available clinical data on brucellosis cases are limited. Methods We retrospectively reviewed medical charts of 2041 patients with confirmed human brucellosis and prospectively recorded their outcomes by telephone interview. These patients were admitted to the Sixth People’s Hospital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region between 1st January and 31st December 2014. Data on these patients were collected from hospital medical records. Results Many patients presented with fatigue (67%), fever (64%), arthralgia (63%) and sweating (54%). High erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (69%), high C-reactive protein (CRP) (39%), high alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (33%) and high aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (20%) were the most common laboratory findings, especially in acute patients. There was evidence of focal involvement in 90% of patients. A total of 61.5% of brucellosis patients recovered. Multivariate logistic regression analyses suggested that the risk factors key to unfavorable prognosis were: age≥45 years (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.36–2.24), back pain (OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.16–1.94) and joint tenderness (OR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.13–2.65). The increasing duration of the illness increased the risk of poor prognosis. Conclusion Patients with brucellosis showed different characteristics in different clinical stages. In China, the chronicity rate of human brucellosis is high. The risk of poor prognosis is increased in patients aged 45 years or older, patients who have had brucellosis for a substantial period of time, and patients with back pain or joint tenderness. The clinical management of brucellosis should be improved to include sensitive diagnostic methods for subacute and chronic brucellosis."
https://openalex.org/W2902454944,"The poor outcomes in infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) necessitate new treatments. Here we discover that EIF4E protein is elevated in most cases of infant ALL and test EIF4E targeting by the repurposed antiviral agent ribavirin, which has anticancer properties through EIF4E inhibition, as a potential treatment. We find that ribavirin treatment of actively dividing infant ALL cells on bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) at clinically achievable concentrations causes robust proliferation inhibition in proportion with EIF4E expression. Further, we find that ribavirin treatment of KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2A-R) infant ALL cells and the KMT2A-AFF1 cell line RS4:11 inhibits EIF4E, leading to decreases in oncogenic EIF4E-regulated cell growth and survival proteins. In ribavirin-sensitive KMT2A-R infant ALL cells and RS4:11 cells, EIF4E-regulated proteins with reduced levels of expression following ribavirin treatment include MYC, MCL1, NBN, BCL2 and BIRC5. Ribavirin-treated RS4:11 cells exhibit impaired EIF4E-dependent nuclear to cytoplasmic export and/or translation of the corresponding mRNAs, as well as reduced phosphorylation of the p-AKT1, p-EIF4EBP1, p-RPS6 and p-EIF4E signaling proteins. This leads to an S-phase cell cycle arrest in RS4:11 cells corresponding to the decreased proliferation. Ribavirin causes nuclear EIF4E to re-localize to the cytoplasm in KMT2A-AFF1 infant ALL and RS4:11 cells, providing further evidence for EIF4E inhibition. Ribavirin slows increases in peripheral blasts in KMT2A-R infant ALL xenograft-bearing mice. Ribavirin cooperates with chemotherapy, particularly L-asparaginase, in reducing live KMT2A-AFF1 infant ALL cells in BMSC co-cultures. This work establishes that EIF4E is broadly elevated across infant ALL and that clinically relevant ribavirin exposures have preclinical activity and effectively inhibit EIF4E in KMT2A-R cases, suggesting promise in EIF4E targeting using ribavirin as a means of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2902093007,"Bone is the most common metastatic site for breast cancer. Estrogen-related-receptor alpha (ERRα) has been implicated in cancer cell invasiveness. Here, we established that ERRα promotes spontaneous metastatic dissemination of breast cancer cells from primary mammary tumors to the skeleton. We carried out cohort studies, pharmacological inhibition, gain-of-function analyses in vivo and cellular and molecular studies in vitro to identify new biomarkers in breast cancer metastases. Meta-analysis of human primary breast tumors revealed that high ERRα expression levels were associated with bone but not lung metastases. ERRα expression was also detected in circulating tumor cells from metastatic breast cancer patients. ERRα overexpression in murine 4T1 breast cancer cells promoted spontaneous bone micro-metastases formation when tumor cells were inoculated orthotopically, whereas lung metastases occurred irrespective of ERRα expression level. In vivo, Rank was identified as a target for ERRα. That was confirmed in vitro in Rankl stimulated tumor cell invasion, in mTOR/pS6K phosphorylation, by transactivation assay, ChIP and bioinformatics analyses. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of ERRα reduced primary tumor growth, bone micro-metastases formation and Rank expression in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic studies and meta-analysis confirmed a positive association between metastases and ERRα/RANK in breast cancer patients and also revealed a positive correlation between ERRα and BRCA1mut carriers. Taken together, our results reveal a novel ERRα/RANK axis by which ERRα in primary breast cancer promotes early dissemination of cancer cells to bone. These findings suggest that ERRα may be a useful therapeutic target to prevent bone metastases."

A class of pharmacological activators, including Merck 991, binds the AMPK ADaM site, which forms the interaction surface between the kinase domain (KD) of the α-subunit and the carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) of the β-subunit. Here, we report the development of two new 991-derivative compounds, R734 and R739, which potently activate AMPK in a variety of cell types, including β2-specific skeletal muscle cells. Surprisingly, we found that they have only minor effects on direct kinase activity of the recombinant α1β2γ1 isoform yet robustly enhance protection against activation loop dephosphorylation. This mode of activation is reminiscent of that of ADP, which activates AMPK by binding to the nucleotide-binding sites in the γ-subunit, more than 60 Å away from the ADaM site. To understand the mechanisms of full and partial AMPK activation, we determined the crystal structures of fully active phosphorylated AMPK α1β1γ1 bound to AMP and R734/R739 as well as partially active nonphosphorylated AMPK bound to R734 and AMP and phosphorylated AMPK bound to R734 in the absence of added nucleotides at <3-Å resolution.

AMPK senses the energy state of cells by competitive binding of AMP, ADP, and ATP to three separate sites in its γ-subunit.

Both compounds consistently activated AMPK α1β1γ1 with similar EC50 values (265 and 257 nm, respectively), although -fold activation was at least twice as high for R734 than R739 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, activation of AMPK α1β2γ1 was weak and varied depending on ligand, substrate, protein preparation, and construct variations, resulting from mild activation to mild inhibition. In contrast to their variable effects on the direct kinase activity of AMPK α1β2γ1, both compounds robustly increased protection against activation loop dephosphorylation of both AMPK α1β1γ1 and α1β2γ1 (Fig. 3B). As a control, both compounds did not inhibit phosphatase activity (Fig. S2). Therefore, R739 and, to a lesser degree, R734 can functionally separate two mechanisms of AMPK activation (direct kinase activation and protection against activation loop dephosphorylation) selectively for the α1β2γ1 isoform. Therefore, AMPK α1β2γ1 activation by R739 in cells may occur predominantly or exclusively by increasing net activation loop phosphorylation. To understand how R734 and R739 affect activation loop phosphorylation and downstream signaling in cells, we tested their effects on AMPK activation loop phosphorylation and phosphorylation of the AMPK targets Raptor and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in parallel with 991 and A769662. We incubated HepG2 cells with increasing doses of the four compounds, lysed cells, and analyzed lysates by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4, the increase in phosphorylation of Raptor and ACC in the presence of R734 and R739 was similar to that of 991 and stronger than that of A769662 (note that A769662 does not activate AMPK α1β2γ1, which is the main AMPK isoform in HepG2 cells). In contrast, AMPK α1/α2 Thr-174/Thr-172 phosphorylation was clearly stronger in the presence of R734 and R739 than in the presence of 991 and A769662. The level of AMPK activity, measured by downstream target phosphorylation, depends on the combination of activation loop phosphorylation and direct, allosteric activation. The observation that R739 and 991 induce similar levels of Raptor and ACC phosphorylation but different levels of AMPK activation loop phosphorylation is therefore consistent with the inability of R739 to directly activate AMPK α1β2γ1. To gain insight into the structural basis of full and partial AMPK activation by R734 and R739, we first cocrystallized both compounds with fully active phosphorylated AMPK α1β1γ1, the kinase domain–stabilizing ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor staurosporine, and AMP (Fig. S3). This allowed us to determine their structures at 2.9- and 2.7-Å resolution, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B; structure statistics in Table 1). As expected, both structures show the hallmarks of fully active AMPK, including a fully aligned regulatory spine and fully resolved activation loop (Fig. S4A), as well as formation of a helix in the CBM linker (C-interacting helix; Fig. 5, A and B) that packs against and stabilizes the regulatory αC helix of the kinase domain, a hallmark for AMPK activated by ADaM site agonists (22Xiao B.

While this topic has been considered in the separate context of sports injuries and anxiety states, these issues have rarely been considered together. The objective of this study is to analyse the association between motivation to overcome injuries in football and the state of anxiety caused by those injuries. One hundred and eighty-five footballers from Spain were analysed by way of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaires, and an injury self-registration sheet. Statistical analyses were performed using structural equations. Results showed a direct and positive relationship between the capacity to face up to injuries or potential injuries and to adapt successfully to them for injured footballers, especially when anxiety was considered as a transitory emotional state. In addition, this relationship was stronger in non-injured sportspersons because their resilience capacity was not being impaired by the experience of an injury."
https://openalex.org/W2902275162,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes, for which hyperglycemia is a major etiological factor. It is known that retinal glia (Müller cells) and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are affected by diabetes, and there is evidence that DR is associated with neural degeneration. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid used to treat many inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, including several eye diseases like DR. Thus, our goal was to study the effect of dexamethasone on the survival of RGCs and Müller glial cells isolated from rat retinas and maintained in vitro under hyperglycemic conditions. The behavior of primary RGC cell cultures, and of mixed RGC and Müller cell co-cultures, was studied in hyperglycemic conditions (30 mM glucose), both in the presence and absence of Dexamethasone (1 μM). RGC and Müller cell survival was evaluated, and the conditioned media of these cultures was collected to quantify the inflammatory cytokines secreted by these cells using a multiplex assay. The role of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα in RGC death was also evaluated by adding these cytokines to the co-cultures. RGC survival decreased significantly when these cells were grown in high glucose conditions, reaching 54% survival when they were grown alone and only 33% when co-cultured with Müller glia. The analysis of the cytokines in the conditioned media revealed an increase in IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα under hyperglycemic conditions, which reverted to the basal concentration in co-cultures maintained in the presence of dexamethasone. Finally, when these cytokines were added to co-cultures they appeared to have a direct effect on RGC survival. Hence, these cytokines could be implicated in the death of RGCs when glucose concentrations increase and dexamethasone might protect RGCs from the cell death induced in these conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2903242050,"Infectious diarrhea can be caused by a large number of microorganisms including bacteria virus and parasites. The clinical syndromic approach has been traditionally used to guide therapy. The aim of this study was to characterize the etiology of acute diarrhea by the FilmArray GI panel and to correlate it with its clinical presentation in an adult population presenting to the emergency room in a developing country. Material and Methods: Adult patients attending the ER due to acute diarrhea were selected. All patients included had a FilmArray GI panel performed and the clinical characteristics were recorded. Results: One hundred and ninety-nine patients were included. One hundred and eighteen (59.3%) were females. The mean age was 43 years old. Thirty three percent of the patients presented dysentery, 36.7% fever, 54.8% referred nauseas and 35.7% vomiting. Sixty three percent of the patients presented some degree of dehydration. In total, 221 microorganisms were detected of which 71.5% corresponded to bacteria (158/221), 19.9% to virus (44/221) and 8.6% to parasites (19/221). In 133 (67.0%) of 199 patients at least one microorganism was identified. Infections with more than one microorganism were detected in 27.1% of the patients. Polimicrobial infections were associated with a higher frequency of nausea (50.0% vs 32.0%, p 0.046), abdominal pain (87.0% vs 44.0%, p<0.0001) and travel history (20.0% vs 5.0%, p 0.0102). Bacterial infections occurred without a seasonal distribution with the exception of Salmonella sp whereas viral infections predominated during the autumn–winter months. Diarreicogenic E. coli were present in the context of a co-infection in more than 80.0% of the cases. Discussion: The use of multiplex panels has given us invaluable information regarding the epidemiology of acute diarrhea in adult. It highlighted the importance of polimicrobial infections and the frequency of diarreicogenic E. coli infections. Nevertheless, the lack of severity compared to monomicrobial infections and the usual association with other microorganisms in the latter make their clinical importance debatable."

Developing a simple and reliable detection method is required.A detection method for R. rickettsii was established based on a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay and the lateral flow (LF) test. A specific target sequence was screened, and corresponding primers and probes were designed, synthesized, and screened for establishing an RPA assay with high amplification efficiency. Reagent concentrations, amplification time, and loading volume for strip development were optimized. The detection limit, analytic sensitivity and specificity were evaluated.A rapid, visual, sensitive and specific method for the detection of R. rickettsii based on RPA and the LF test was successfully established. The novel method had a limit of detection of 10 to 50 copies/reaction without recognizing other organisms. Analytical sensitivity and specificity were ≥90% and 100%, respectively, as evaluated by animal and simulative human samples.Using the established method, detection could be completed in 30 min with visually detectable results by the naked eye, without requirement of any instrument except a constant temperature equipment. The technique shows superior detection performance and is promising for wide use in the field as well as resource-limited areas for R. rickettsii detection."

The present study utilized the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) to examine the content of specific autobiographical memories (AMs) recalled by individuals with MDD during an autobiographical memory task.We examined various features of the text (including use of affective, cognitive, and self-referential terms), as well as their associations with clinical and cognitive features of MDD (depression severity, autobiographical memory specificity, amygdala activity), in 45 unmedicated adults with MDD compared to 61 healthy controls.When recalling positive memories MDD individuals used the word ""I"" less, fewer positive words, more words indicating present focus (present tense verbs), and fewer words overall to describe memories compared to controls. When recalling negative memories, MDD individuals used ""I"" more, more words indicating present focus, and more words overall to describe memories relative to controls. Depression severity was correlated with word count, the use of ""I"", and words indicating present focus in negative memories and inversely correlated with word count and the use of ""I"" in positive memories. Autobiographical memory specificity was correlated with word count, the use of ""I"", and words indicating present focus for positive memories and inversely correlated with the use of ""I"" and words indicating present focus for negative memories.Due to the nature of AM recall, we could not control for the number of memories which participants recalled in each mnemonic category.Results align with literature implicating rumination and intensive self-focus in depression and suggest that interventions targeting specific word use may be therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of MDD."

Fatty acid nitroalkenes are endogenously detectable products of nitric oxide and nitrite-dependent metabolic and inflammatory reactions with unsaturated fatty acids.

The multitude of exogenously and endogenously stimulated DNA-damaging events requires that DNA damage be vigilantly detected and efficiently repaired. Several DNA repair mechanisms have been identified that ameliorate deleterious genomic perturbations such as direct reversal, mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and double-stranded break (DSB) repair (4Curtin N.J. DNA repair dysregulation from cancer driver to therapeutic target.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12 (23175119): 801-81710.1038/nrc3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). DNA DSBs are particularly pathogenic as the loss of genomic material and mutations promote genomic variability and disequilibrium. There are two main pathways to repair DSBs: nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and HR. Although NHEJ is faster and more frequently used, HR repair mechanisms maintain the highest fidelity of the genome. HR repair protects cells from the deleterious genomic instability caused by DSB by correcting for genetic material loss through homologous template searches that maintain the genomic landscape (5Moynahan M.E. Jasin M. Mitotic homologous recombination maintains genomic stability and suppresses tumorigenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 (20177395): 196-20710.1038/nrm2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). RAD51 is a critical component of HR that facilitates the homology search and strand exchange to repair DSBs (6Prakash R. Zhang Y. Feng W. Jasin M.

Consequently, reductions in RAD51 and paralog activity are linked with carcinogenesis (8Chen J. Morrical M.D. Donigan K.A. Weidhaas J.B. Sweasy J.B. Averill A.M. Tomczak J.A. Morrical S.W.

Overexpression of RAD51 inhibits chemotherapeutic efficacy in cancer patients by rendering cancer cells more resistant to DNA-damaging agents. Responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy are inversely correlated with BRCA1, γH2AX, and RAD51 foci before treatment, as well as the numbers of RAD51 foci following treatment (11Graeser M. McCarthy A.

We report that combination treatments of OA-NO2 with the antineoplastic agents doxorubicin, cisplatin, IR, and olaparib enhance the antiproliferative effect of these DNA-damaging therapeutic strategies in TNBC cells. OA-NO2 was identified to suppress IR-induced RAD51 foci formation, inhibit RAD51 binding to ssDNA, decrease HR, induce phosphorylation of Ser-139 H2AX (γH2AX), disrupt RAD51–ABL heterodimerization, and decrease RAD51 Tyr-315 phosphorylation. These observations reinforce the concept that reactive species induce genomic perturbations in part via the disruption of HR and reveal a novel therapeutic strategy: that redox-derived soft electrophiles sensitize cancer cells to DNA-directed therapeutic strategies such as IR, cisplatin, and doxorubicin. Current data indicate that OA-NO2 inhibits multiple aspects of TNBC epithelial cell, but not nontumorigenic breast epithelial cell, NF-κB signaling, by alkylating functionally significant thiols in (a) the inhibitor of NF-κB subunit kinase β, thus limiting downstream IκKα phosphorylation and (b) the NF-κB RelA protein, thus preventing DNA binding and promoting RelA polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (3Woodcock C.C.

This motivated assessing whether OA-NO2 could also enhance TNBC DNA damage in vivo. MDA-MD-231 cells were implanted into the mammary gland of mice, and when tumors reached a volume of 100 mm3, mice were treated with 15 mg/kg nonelectrophilic fatty acid oleic acid (OA) or OA-NO2 by gavage for 4 weeks. Mice treated with OA-NO2 had significantly decreased tumor growth rates when compared with OA-treated controls (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). Probing tumor levels of the DNA damage biomarker γH2AX by immunoblotting showed that OA-NO2–treated mice displayed higher levels of γH2AX (Fig. 1B). Densitometric quantification of tumoral γH2AX/β-actin protein levels in OA- and OA-NO2–treated mice showed increased γH2AX in OA-NO2–treated mice. This response became statistically significant after Grubbs outlier detection and elimination of OA–treated mouse 2 (Fig. S1, B and C). The orthotopic tumor in OA mouse 2 was the largest tumor in the study, with necrosis potentially causing enhanced γH2AX levels. The TNBC growth-inhibitory effects of OA-NO2 were then evaluated in combination with DNA-damaging agents. The cell lines MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and Hs578T were treated with OA-NO2 daily for 3 days, and relative cell numbers were quantified by measuring the ATP-dependent luminescence signal generated using Ultra-Glo luciferase with the substrate luciferin. The EC50 values for growth inhibition of TNBC cells ranged from 1.98 ± 0.52 (Hs578T) to 3.78 ± 0.48 μm (BT-549) with MDA-MB-231 cells displaying an EC50 value of 3.66 ± 0.14 μm (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1D). We next tested the DNA-damaging agents doxorubicin and cisplatin in combination with daily treatment with 2 μm OA-NO2. OA-NO2 enhanced growth inhibition of doxorubicin in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells, by 7- and 5-fold, respectively (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1E). The growth of BT-549 cells was not affected. Cotreatment with OA-NO2 and cisplatin showed a similar trend for MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells, which displayed increased growth inhibition by 6- and 3-fold, respectively, whereas growth inhibition of BT-549 cells was suppressed 1.4-fold (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1F). A subset of TNBC cells are sensitive to PARP inhibition and display a BRCAness phenotype in the presence of WT BRCA1 (14Sharma P. Update on the treatment of early-stage triple-negative breast cancer.Curr. Treat. Options Oncol. 2018; 19 (29656345): 2210.1007/s11864-018-0539-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), so the PARP-1 inhibitor olaparib was evaluated to determine whether a combination treatment with OA-NO2 enhanced potency. MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and BT-549 cells all displayed enhanced growth inhibition when olaparib was combined with OA-NO2 by 5-, 17-, and 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 1F and Fig. S1G). To specifically show that olaparib treatment in combination with OA-NO2, but not OA, affected proliferation and to evaluate the effect of daily olaparib media exchanges, MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation was quantified in dose-response assays. Daily administration of olaparib in combination with OA did not significantly alter the EC50 of olaparib in MDA-MB-231 cells. In contrast, olaparib in combination with OA-NO2 significantly inhibited growth (Fig. 1G). Thus, standard TNBC chemotherapeutic drugs as well as targeted PARP-1 inhibition exhibited enhanced antiproliferative effects when coadministered with OA-NO2 in TNBC cells. The heightened tumor γH2AX levels in vivo and sensitization of TNBC cells to DNA-damaging agents, especially in the context of olaparib-induced responses, led to further exploration of DNA damage repair modulation by OA-NO2. As olaparib sensitivity is a hallmark of HR-deficient cells (15Robert M. Frenel J.S. Gourmelon C. Patsouris A. Augereau P. Campone M. Olaparib for the treatment of breast cancer.Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2017; 26 (28395540): 751-75910.1080/13543784.2017.1318847Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whether OA-NO2 impacted DNA repair by HR was evaluated. To specifically probe DNA double-strand break repair, MDA-MB-231 cells were challenged with 5 Gy of IR, and RAD51 foci were quantified. The treatment of breast cancer cells with OA-NO2 inhibited RAD51 foci formation as reflected by (a) the number of cells with more than five foci and (b) responses of vehicle-treated cells following IR (Fig. 1H). Cell cycle analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells confirmed that no significant changes to the cell cycle occurred that might indirectly alter RAD51 foci formation (Fig. S1H). Evaluation of nuclear γH2AX staining to probe for DNA damage of MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence or absence of 5 Gy of IR found that OA-NO2 significantly increased nuclear γH2AX localization in irradiated MDA-MB-231 cells compared with vehicle controls, indicating increases in DSBs and overall DNA damage (Fig. 1I). Increasing concentrations of OA-NO2 also enhanced breast cancer cell death in a clonogenic assay following irradiation with 2 Gy of IR (Fig. S1I). Evaluation of the DNA-damaging effects of OA and OA-NO2 on nontransformed MCF10A cells following 5 Gy of IR found that nuclear γH2AX staining was only increased in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells treated with OA-NO2 and not MCF10A cells (Fig. S2, A and B). OA-NO2–dependent effects on HR DNA repair were further investigated by utilizing a direct repeat GFP (DR-GFP) reporter assay. This analysis quantifies intracellular recombination of an integrated cDNA cassette of two tandem nonfluorescent GFP constructs, following introduction of an I-SceI cleavage to the system, by measuring the fluorescent GFP protein that is produced following successful recombination (16Moynahan M.E. Pierce A.J. Jasin M. BRCA2 is required for homology-directed repair of chromosomal breaks.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7 (11239455): 263-27210.1016/S1097-2765(01)00174-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Daily OA-NO2 treatment of U2OS cells harboring the DR-GFP construct revealed that after I-SceI transfection, the number of GFP-positive cells was significantly decreased by 2-fold when compared with native OA or vehicle control after 48 h (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3A). A novel strategy was used to measure the kinetics of changes in HR in live cells by using automated fluorescence microscopy to track the emergence of GFP-positive cells over time in monolayers, as opposed to making static measurements of detached cells using flow cytometry. To account for changes in cell density over time, cell confluence was measured following treatment of DR-GFP U2OS cells with vehicle, 5 μm OA or OA-NO2 every 4 h for 3 days (Fig. S3B). The emergence of GFP-positive cells subsequent to I-SceI–induced cleavage was quantified and normalized to cell confluence over time to compare OA-NO2–treated with OA-treated and untreated cells. Daily administration of 5 μm OA-NO2 decreased the number of GFP-positive cells by 2-fold over 68 h when compared with controls (Fig. 2B). The impact of OA-NO2 on suppression of DSB repair through both the HR and NHEJ pathways was examined by utilizing an EJ5-GFP NHEJ reporter assay, which separates GFP cDNA from a transcriptional promoter with a puromycin resistance gene flanked by two I-SceI cleavage sites (17Bennardo N. Cheng A. Huang N. Stark J.M. Alternative-NHEJ is a mechanistically distinct pathway of mammalian chromosome break repair.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4 (18584027)e100011010.1371/journal.pgen.1000110Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In contrast to the effects seen by DR-GFP–mediated HR measurements, EJ5-GFP U2OS cells showed no effect of OA-NO2 on NHEJ. This was indicated by an absence of changes in the number of GFP-positive cells following I-SceI cleavage after 48 h by flow cytometric analysis or over 68 h by live-cell fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2, C and D, and Fig. S3C). Inhibition of IR-induced RAD51 foci formation and DR-GFP HR reporter functionality by OA-NO2 was further studied by testing whether overexpression of the critical HR protein RAD51 in the HR reporter cells could rescue the effects of OA-NO2. HR activity, as measured by the percentage of GFP-positive cells relative to OA control treatment, was significantly increased in U2OS DR-GFP reporter cells stably overexpressing RAD51 treated with 5 μm OA-NO2 compared with control reporter cells (Fig. 3A and Fig. S4A). Protein structural data (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1N0W) show that Cys-319 is a solvent-exposed nucleophile within the RAD51 C terminus (Fig. S4B) that is susceptible to reaction with RI-1, a reagent also having Michael acceptor qualities (18Budke B. Logan H.L. Kalin J.H. Zelivianskaia A.S. Cameron McGuire W. Miller L.L. Stark J.M. Kozikowski A.P. Bishop D.K. Connell P.P. RI-1: a chemical inhibitor of RAD51 that disrupts homologous recombination in human cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 (22573178): 7347-735710.1093/nar/gks353Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Moreover, fluorophore adduction of Cys-319 disrupts RAD51 filament formation in vitro (19Modesti M. Ristic D. van der Heijden T. Dekker C. van Mameren J. Peterman E.J. Wuite G.J. Kanaar R. Wyman C. Fluorescent human RAD51 reveals multiple nucleation sites and filament segments tightly associated along a single DNA molecule.Structure. 2007; 15 (17502105): 599-60910.1016/j.str.2007.04.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that OA-NO2 would react with RAD51 Cys-319. Indeed, biotin-OA-NO2, but not the nonelectrophilic biotin-OA and biotin-10-nitro-octadecanoic acid (SA-NO2), supported affinity precipitation of RAD51 from cell lysates with streptavidin-labeled beads (Fig. 3B). Comparing RAD51 C312S or C319S mutant reaction with biotin-OA-NO2 revealed a preferential reaction of OA-NO2 with Cys-319 (Fig. 3C). RAD51 C312S and RAD51 WT controls were readily affinity-precipitated by biotin-OA-NO2 as opposed to when RAD51 C319S was expressed in mutant cells. Of note, the RAD51 C312S mutant displayed enhanced precipitation of OA-NO2, which may reflect interruption of a disulfide bond between RAD51 Cys-312 and Cys-319 or another intracellular protein that obscures Cys-319. The ability of OA-NO2 to specifically disrupt RAD51 binding from DNA was probed by quantifying changes in fluorescence polarization of an Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated single-stranded oligonucleotide in vitro. OA-NO2, but not OA, decreased the relative polarization of RAD51 in the presence of ATP and DNA (Fig. 3D). Control experiments found that OA and OA-NO2 did not cause nonspecific effects through fluorophore quenching to decrease fluorescence polarization (Fig. S4C). Computational analysis revealed that OA-NO2 alkylation of RAD51 Cys-319 is further stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with Pro-318 of RAD51 and hydrogen bonding with Glu-322 (Fig. 3E). Cys-319 is located in the RAD51 C terminus within one of the two ABL-SH3–binding domains (amino acids 283–286 and 318–321) (20Slupianek A. Dasgupta Y. Ren S.Y. Gurdek E. Donlin M. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Fleury F. Skorski T. Targeting RAD51 phosphotyrosine-315 to prevent unfaithful recombination repair in BCR-ABL1 leukemia.Blood. 2011; 118 (21653319): 1062-106810.1182/blood-2010-09-307256Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition to RAD51 filament disruption, OA-NO2 inhibited heterodimerization of RAD51 and ABL. IP analysis revealed that purified RAD51 and catalytic ABL core (Src homology 2 (SH2), SH3, and kinase domains only) complex formation was abolished by OA-NO2 (Fig. 3F). ABL regulates RAD51 activity via sequential phosphorylation of RAD51 Tyr-54 and then Tyr-315 (21Popova M. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Lebechec M. Takahashi M. Fleury F. Detection of c-Abl kinase-promoted phosphorylation of Rad51 by specific antibodies reveals that Y54 phosphorylation is dependent on that of Y315.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583 (19427856): 1867-187210.1016/j.febslet.2009.04.044Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 22Subramanyam S.

By transfecting FLAG-RAD51 and ABL core into 293T cells, the impact of OA-NO2 on RAD51–ABL complex formation and RAD51 Tyr-315 phosphorylation was examined. After treating cells with 0–5 μm OA-NO2 for 1 h, FLAG IP analysis revealed that OA-NO2 decreased the amount of ABL bound to RAD51 (Fig. 3G). Along with the inhibition of RAD51–ABL complex formation, RAD51 Tyr-315 phosphorylation was also inhibited by OA-NO2 in FLAG-RAD51– and ABL-expressing cells. To define whether OA-NO2 alkylates endogenous RAD51 in TNBC cells, biotin-OA-NO2 was added to MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Biotin-OA-NO2–RAD51 complex formation upon streptavidin precipitation was observed in lysates of both cell lines (Fig. 3H). Overall, these data reveal that OA-NO2 inhibited HR by forming adducts with RAD51 and possibly additional HR-related target proteins to enhance sensitivity to DNA-directed cancer therapies (Fig. 3I). Fatty acid nitroalkenes are endogenously produced products of nitric oxide– and nitrite-dependent nitration of unsaturated fatty acids. By virtue of kinetically rapid and reversible Michael addition, fatty acid nitroalkenes mediate the post-translational modification of susceptible Cys residues of proteins, in some cases modifying protein function and inducing signaling responses via pleiotropic mechanisms (1Schopfer F.J.

The present results indicate that OA-NO2 decreases the proliferation of TNBC cells, especially when coadministered with clinically relevant DNA-directed therapeutic agents (Fig. 1). OA-NO2 also amplified the induction of DSB through IR or I-SceI DNA cleavage by limiting IR-induced nuclear RAD51 foci formation and DNA recombination, specifically via inhibiting HR and not NHEJ (Figure 1, Figure 2). The functionally significant Cys-319 of RAD51 was targeted by OA-NO2, but not by nonelectrophilic native and nitroalkane-substituted control fatty acids (Fig. 3). Cys-319 alkylation by OA-NO2 disrupted RAD51 dimerization with ABL and decreased ABL-induced phosphorylation of RAD51 Tyr-315 (Fig. 3). OA-NO2 may also target proteins beyond RAD51 that modulate HR. The potent antiproliferative effect of olaparib, when administered in combination with OA-NO2 in TNBC cell lines, indicates the pharmacological induction of a BRCAness phenotype by OA-NO2 (Fig. 1). Suppression of HR-mediated DNA DSB repair by OA-NO2 is reflective of loss of function mutations in BRCA genes, which cause deficits in DNA repair capacity via impairment of HR. Breast cancer patients harboring BRCA1 loss of function mutations may also benefit from suppression of RAD51, as increased expression of RAD51 bypasses BRCA1 function and is a common feature of BRCA1-deficient breast tumors (25Martin R.W. Orelli B.J. Yamazoe M. Minn A.J. Takeda S. Bishop D.K. RAD51 up-regulation bypasses BRCA1 function and is a common feature of BRCA1-deficient breast tumors.Cancer Res. 2007; 67 (17942895): 9658-966510.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-0290Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Additional investigation of further OA-NO2 targets and actions, coupled with PARP inhibition in BRCA1-deficient breast cancer backgrounds, is thus warranted. Although functional HR is important for maintaining genome stability, an enhancement of homology-directed DNA repair activities impedes chemotherapeutic and ionizing radiation treatments for cancer (6Prakash R.

Seventy-two third molars were used and divided into two groups: sound dentin and in vitro eroded dentin. The in vitro erosion was performed following a demineralization protocol, in which the specimens were immersed in a demineralizing solution for 2 minutes per cycle and remineralizing solution for 10 minutes per cycle for 9 days. Both groups were submitted to four dentin surface treatments: control group (without any treatment), 2% chlorhexidine, 20% polyacrylic acid, and 0.1 M EDTA (n = 9). Blocks of resin-based composite were bonded with RelyX U200 self-adhesive resin cement applied on the pretreated dentin surfaces. The teeth were sectioned into beams (1mm2) and submitted to microtensile bond strength testing to evaluate the bond strength of self-adhesive resin cement to dentin after 24 hours and 8 months of immersion in artificial saliva. Three specimens of each group were longitudinally cut and evaluated using confocal laser scanning microscopy to analyze the dentin/cement interface. Eroded dentin showed higher bond strength values when compared to sound dentin for the 2% chlorhexidine group (p = 0.03), 24 hours after adhesion. When considering eroded dentin, the 0.1M EDTA group showed higher bond strength values with a statistically significant difference only for the control group (p = 0.002). After 8 months of storage, the present results showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the two substrates for all experimental groups (p>0.05). Analysis of the microscopy confocal showed different types of treatments performed on dentin generally increased tags formation when compared to the control group. The eroded dentin showed a significant increase in density and depth of resinous tags when compared to sound dentin. The storage of samples for 8 months seems to have not caused significant degradation of the adhesive interface."
https://openalex.org/W2903136275,"Objectives To use next generation sequencing to characterize the microbiota of horses during healing of skin wounds in two anatomical locations (body and limb) known to present different healing patterns; and to investigate the impact of bandaging on bacterial communities of skin wounds located on the limbs of horses. Methods Full-thickness skin wounds were created on the distal extremity of both thoracic limbs and on one lateral mid-thoracic wall of four healthy horses. Limb wounds were randomly assigned to bandaging or not. A full-thickness sample was collected with a biopsy punch from intact thorax and limb skin (T0) and from the margin of one wound per site (thorax, unbandaged limb, bandaged limb) 1 week (T1) and 2 weeks (T2) postoperatively, and at full healing (T3). Thoracic skin samples obtained from three healthy horses were included in the analysis as controls. Results Anatomic location (thorax vs. limb) significantly influenced bacterial composition of equine skin and healing wounds. Fusobacterium and Actinobacillus were strongly associated with limb wounds during the initial phases of healing. Bandaging had a significant impact on the microbiota during the healing process. The skin microbiota after healing was more similar to samples from controls, demonstrating the resilience and stability of the environment. Conclusions Equine skin microbiota is a rich and stable environment that is disturbed by wounding, but returns to its previous stage after full healing. Anatomic location significantly influences bacterial composition of the equine skin during wound healing. Bandaging has a significant impact on the skin microbiota of horses during the healing process. Results of this study provide new insight for a better understanding of the contribution of bacteria to wound healing in horses and may facilitate the future development of therapeutic strategies using commensal bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2903461446,"Women's basic beliefs about birth as a natural and as a medical process are associated with childbirth choices and experience. These beliefs have only recently been quantified and not much is known about their development. In the current study, we assessed the differential effects of the objective and the subjective birth experience on changes in these beliefs. Using self-report questionnaires, we evaluated prenatal to postpartum changes among 342 Israeli first-time mothers. Participants were recruited during pregnancy, between February 2016 and January 2017, mostly in clinical settings, and followed-up two months postpartum. On average, women's beliefs about birth being natural weakened following childbirth and their belief about birth being medical strengthened. In regression models, it was either the objective or the subjective experience that was related to change in the basic birth beliefs: A more medicalized birth was associated with strengthening of the medical belief while greater birth satisfaction was related to strengthening of the natural belief. A mediation effect was observed, which indicated that the beliefs are strengthened when the lived experience fulfilled women's expectation about birth being satisfying, natural or medical. This study adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding the development and evolution of the birth beliefs. It highlights the need to view the beliefs separately and to distinctively assess the objective and subjective birth experience. It supports the need to empower mothers, especially those who had more medicalized births or unsatisfactory ones, which would help conserve their belief in their body and in the normal physiological course of birth."
https://openalex.org/W2903028429,"Allergic diseases represent a major issue in clinical and experimental immunology due to their high and increasing incidence worldwide. Allergy status of the mother remains the best predictor of an individual’s increased risk of allergy development. Dysregulation of the balance between different branches of immune response, chiefly excessive polarization towards Th2, is the underlying cause of allergic diseases. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a pivotal role in the timely establishment of physiological immune polarization and are crucial for control of allergy. In our study we used flow cytometry to assess Tregs in cord blood of newborns of healthy (n = 121) and allergic (n = 108) mothers. We observed a higher percentage of Tregs (CD4+CD25+CD127lowFoxP3+) in cord blood of children of allergic mothers. However, the percentage of cells expressing extracellular (PD-1, CTLA-4, GITR) and intracellular (IL-10, TGF-β) markers of function was lower (significantly for PD-1 and IL-10) within Tregs of these children. Furthermore, Helios- induced Tregs in the cord blood of children of allergic mothers were decreased. These results were supported by a decrease in plasma levels of IL-10 and TGF-β in cord blood of newborns of allergic mothers, implying lower tolerogenic capacity on the systemic level. Taken together, these findings reflect deficient function of Tregs in the group with higher risk of allergy development. This may be caused by a lower maturation status of the immune system, specifically Tregs, at birth. Such immaturity may represent an important mechanism involved in the increased risk of allergy in children of allergic mothers."
https://openalex.org/W2903434637,"Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis and paracoccidioidomycosis are infectious diseases with similar epidemiological and clinical aspects. Cases of both diseases may manifest similar lesions in the mucosa. Therefore, the determination of distinguishing characteristics for the purpose of differential diagnosis is critical for better management of the diseases. The present study evaluated factors that assist in the differentiation of mucosal lesions between these diseases. This cross-sectional study included data from medical records of 122 cases of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis and 83 cases of paracoccidioidomycosis attended at the university hospital Cassiano Antonio Moraes, located in Vitória, Espírito Santo State, Brazil. Comparison between the diseases included the following variables: sex, age, time of disease evolution, location of the lesion and symptoms. Adults and males were affected by both diseases at higher rates. Lesions in the nasal region (95.1%; p-value = 0.000) and the pharynx (20.5%; p-value = 0.009) and nasal obstruction (34.4%; p-value = 0.000) were associated with leishmaniasis. Paracoccidioidomycosis was associated with lesions in the oral region (90.4%; p-value = 0.000), oral pain (16.9%; p-value = 0.000), and hoarseness (14.5%; p-value = 0.008). In leishmaniasis, lesions in oral regions were not associated with oral pain and were frequently located close to the nasal area. The manifestations cited above could improve the differential diagnosis of leishmaniasis and paracoccidioidomycosis, and thereby potentially aid in the choice of appropriate confirmatory diagnostic testing."
https://openalex.org/W2903483323,"5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR, or acadesine) is a precursor of the monophosphate derivative 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide ribonucleoside 5'-phosphate (ZMP), an intermediate in de novo purine biosynthesis. AICAR proved to have promising anti-proliferative properties, although the molecular basis of its toxicity is poorly understood. To exert cytotoxicity, AICAR needs to be metabolized, but the AICAR-derived toxic metabolite was not identified. Here, we show that ZMP is the major toxic derivative of AICAR in yeast and establish that its metabolization to succinyl-ZMP, ZDP, or ZTP (di- and triphosphate derivatives of AICAR) strongly reduced its toxicity. Affinity chromatography identified 74 ZMP-binding proteins, including 41 that were found neither as AMP nor as AICAR or succinyl-ZMP binders. Overexpression of karyopherin-β Kap123, one of the ZMP-specific binders, partially rescued AICAR toxicity. Quantitative proteomic analyses revealed 57 proteins significantly less abundant on nuclei-enriched fractions from AICAR-fed cells, this effect being compensated by overexpression of KAP123 for 15 of them. These results reveal nuclear protein trafficking as a function affected by AICAR."
https://openalex.org/W2903074003,"The concept of frailty has been used in the clinical and research field for more than two decades. It is usually described as a clinical state of heightened vulnerability to poor resolution of homeostasis after a stressor event, which thereby increases the risk of adverse outcomes, including falls, delirium, disability and mortality. Here we report the results of the first genome-wide association scan and comparative gene ontology analyses where we aimed to identify genes and pathways associated with the deficit model of frailty. We used a discovery-replication design with two independent, nationally representative samples of older adults. The square-root transformed Frailty Index (FI) was the outcome variable, and age and sex were included as covariates. We report one hit exceeding genome-wide significance: the rs6765037 A allele was significantly associated with a decrease in the square-root transformed FI score in the Discovery sample (beta = -0.01958, p = 2.14E-08), without confirmation in the Replication sample. We also report a nominal replication: the rs7134291 A allele was significantly associated with a decrease in the square-root transformed FI score (Discovery sample: beta = -0.01021, p = 1.85E-06, Replication sample: beta = -0.005013, p = 0.03433). These hits represent the KBTBD12 and the GRIN2B genes, respectively. Comparative gene ontology analysis identified the pathways ‘Neuropathic pain signalling in dorsal horn neurons’ and the ‘GPCR-Mediated Nutrient Sensing in Enteroendocrine Cells’, exceeding the p = 0.01 significance in both samples, although this result does not survive correction for multiple testing. Considering the crucial role of GRIN2B in brain development, synaptic plasticity and cognition, this gene appears to be a potential candidate to play a role in frailty. In conclusion, we conducted genome-wide association scan and pathway analyses and have identified genes and pathways with potential roles in frailty. However, frailty is a complex condition. Therefore, further research is required to confirm our results and more thoroughly identify relevant biological mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2902045755,"Background The majority of women suffering from maternal morbidities live in resource-constrained settings with diverse barriers preventing access to quality biomedical health care services. This study aims to highlight the dynamics between the public health system and alternative healing through an exploration of the experiences of health care seeking among women living with severe symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse in an impoverished setting. Methods The data were collected through ethnographic fieldwork at the hospital and community levels in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. The fieldwork included participant observation, 42 semi-structured interviews and two focus group discussions over a period of one year. A group of 24 women with severe symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse served as the study’s main informants. Other central groups of informants included health care providers, local healers and actors from the health authorities and non-governmental organisations. Results Three case stories were chosen to illustrate the key findings related to health care seeking among the informants. The women strove to find remedies for their aggravating ailment, and many navigated between and combined various available healing options both within and beyond the health care sector. Their choices were strongly influenced by poverty, by lack of knowledge about the condition, by their religious and spiritual beliefs and by the shame and embarrassment related to the condition. An ongoing health campaign in the study area providing free surgical treatment for pelvic organ prolapse enabled a study of the experiences related to the introduction of free health services targeting maternal morbidity. Conclusions This study highlights how structural barriers prevent women living in a resource-constrained setting from receiving health care for a highly prevalent and readily treatable maternal morbidity such as pelvic organ prolapse. Our results illustrate that the provision of free quality services may dramatically alter both health-and illness-related perceptions and conduct in an extremely vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W2903305036,"Flight initiation distance (FID)–the distance at which an individual leaves in response to the approach of a perceived threat–provides a measurement of risk-taking behavior. If individuals optimize their FID, this distance should reflect the point at which the fitness resulting from leaving exceeds the fitness resulting from all other possible decisions. Previous theory of FID has often been aimed at explaining this behavior in foraging individuals. Yet flight initiation in response to approaching threats occurs in a range of contexts that might influence optimal behavior. In breeding individuals, risk-taking decisions that are made at a location of offspring care (e.g., a nest or den) can have significant effects on fitness. Here, we develop a theoretical model of distances at which a parent bird flushes from a nest in response to an approaching threat. We estimate parent fitness with regards to characteristics of the parent (reproductive values, detection distance, and cost of lost parental care cost), the nest (concealment and accessibility), and the approaching predator (detection capability and predation success), developing a dichotomous scenario between staying at the nest or leaving at varying distances. Using a generalized comparison of the benefits of leaving versus staying, we find that increasing costs of lost parental care, probability of predation of the parent due to fleeing, or current reproductive value lead to more instances of staying at the nest. In a complementary approach with specified parameters based on biologically-informed factors that likely influence a predator-prey encounter, we find that increasing the current reproductive value, concealment of the nest, or costs of lost parental care decrease optimal FID and can lead to the parent staying at the nest. Other factors, such as increasing residual reproductive value, predation success, and predator capability of detecting the nest, increase optimal FID with some instances of costs of fleeing being so great that staying becomes an optimal strategy. Our theory provides a framework to explain variation in FID among nesting species and individuals and could provide a foundation for future empirical investigations of risk-taking behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2902077007,"Although anti-retroviral therapies have greatly extended the lives of HIV infected individuals, current treatments are unable to completely eliminate virally infected cells. A number of latency reversing agents have been proposed for use in a “shock and kill” strategy to reactivate latent HIV, thus making it vulnerable to killing mechanisms. Procyanidin trimer C1 (PC1) is a flavonoid found in multiple plant sources including grape, apple, and cacao, which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. We determined that PC1 reactivates latent HIV in cell line and primary cell models of HIV, through activation of the MAPK pathway. Notably, PC1 reactivates latent HIV without increasing surface markers of T cell activation. Combining several therapeutics, which activate HIV transcription through different mechanisms, is the most efficient approach to clinically reactivate latent reservoirs. We utilized PC1 (MAPK agonist), kansui (PKC agonist), and JQ1 (BET bromodomain inhibitor) in a triple combination approach to reactivate latent HIV in cell line and primary cell models of HIV latency. When used in combination, low concentrations which fail to reactivate HIV as single treatments, are effective. Thus, several mechanisms, using distinct activation pathways, act together to reactivate latent HIV."

Photorhabdus asymbiotica is an entomopathogenic bacterium living in mutual relationship with nematodes of the Heterorhabditis species. Upon invasion of the nematodes in insect larvae, Photorhabdus produces several highly active protein toxins, which prevent phagocytosis and autophagy. The toxins destroy the actin cytoskeleton, induce apoptosis, and finally kill the animal (1Hapeshi A. Waterfield N.R. Photorhabdus asymbiotica as an insect and human pathogen.Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Two enzymatic effector domains were identified in the C-terminal part of PaTox substantiating that the toxin has a multidomain structure common for many protein bacterial toxins (8Zhang D. de Souza R.F.

Most of these large protein toxins have a receptor-binding domain, providing tropism to specific cell types, a translocation domain, an autocatalytic peptidase domain for toxin processing, and one or several effector domains. PaTox harbors a glycosyltransferase domain (PaToxG), which is guided to the negatively charged inner leaflet of the host cells’ cytoplasmic membrane. There it mono-O-glycosylates a tyrosine in the switch I region of Rho GTPases using UDP-GlcNAc (10Jank T. Bogdanović X. Wirth C. Haaf E. Spoerner M. Böhmer K.E. Steinemann M. Orth J.H. Kalbitzer H.R.

This modification impairs Rho signaling and results in actin cytoskeleton disintegration, blockade of phagocytosis, and death of insect larvae. The second effector domain is a deamidase (PaToxD) that resembles the type III secreted effector SseI from Salmonella typhimurium (11Brink T. Leiss V. Siegert P. Jehle D. Ebner J.K. Schwan C.

In this study, we set out to decipher the role of the region of PaTox upstream of the two effector domains. The function and impact of this region during infection is unknown. Sequence analysis suggested a cysteine protease–like domain, which we named PaToxP. It includes a typical cysteine–histidine–aspartate triad. The crystal structure of PaToxP was determined and demonstrated high similarity to the C58-protease AvrPphB (12Agarwal S. Agarwal S. Biancucci M. Satchell K.J.

Members of the C58-protease family are present in many bacterial toxins and effectors, including Vibrio vulnificus MARTX toxin, Photorhabdus luminescens Mcf2 toxin, and the Histophilus somni effector IbpA (12Agarwal S.

We show that an intact catalytic triad of PaToxP is crucial for cell rounding and cell blebbing effects, which resemble apoptotic phenotypes in mammalian cells. Cell intoxication experiments revealed that the protease domain acts in concert with the glycosyltransferase and the deamidase domain. Two enzymatically active domains of PaTox, which act in the cytoplasm of the host cell were previously identified by protein sequence similarity analysis (10Jank T. Bogdanović X. Wirth C. Haaf E.

Those are the tyrosine-glycosyltransferase PaToxG, which modifies Rho GTPases and influences the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and the deamidase PaToxD, which modifies heterotrimeric Gα proteins.

GlobPlot: exploring protein sequences for globularity and disorder.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31 (12824398): 3701-370810.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) gave hints for a distinct third globular domain upstream of the glycosyltransferase domain (Fig. 1A). Sequence alignment of this region (amino acids 1844–2114), which was named PaToxP, revealed similarity with peptidases of the C58 YopT peptidase family (Fig. S1). Moreover, the alignment suggested that the catalytic center of PaToxP is formed by the 3 amino acid residues Cys-1865, His-1955, and Asp-1975, building a catalytic triad typical for cysteine proteases. We cloned extended fragments of this region comprising amino acids 1701–2114 (called henceforth WT protein PaToxP) and a variant where the nucleophilic cysteine residue from the catalytic triad was replaced by alanine (C1865A, called PaToxPCA). We produced and purified PaToxPCA (Fig. S2) and performed crystallization experiments. We obtained initial crystals of the PaToxPCA variant under several conditions and of varying quality. Crystallization conditions were optimized and phases were obtained by native single-wavelength anomalous diffraction of sulfur atoms (native-SAD) (Table 1). The structure was refined at 2.0 Å resolution using a high-resolution native data set (Table 1). PaToxPCA crystallized in space group P212121 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Refinement converged with an Rfactor of 0.175 and Rfree of 0.214. The main chain dihedral angles of all residues are in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, with 96.6% of residues in preferred regions, 1.4% in allowed regions, and no outliers.

Open table in a new tab The structure of PaToxP comprises two domains (Fig. 1B). Amino acid residues 1844–2032 form a globular domain with an α–β–α structural fold (green). The N-terminal domain comprises amino acids 1730–1843 and is mainly α helical (gray). Amino acid residues 1921–1926 and 1964–1967 were poorly resolved and thus omitted from the structure. In addition, 184 water and few ethylene glycol molecules were included. The N-terminal domain belongs to a yet unidentified part of the toxin and comprises five α-helices and a small two-stranded β-sheet. The structure of the globular protease domain consists of a central 6-stranded antiparallel β-sheet that divides 8 helices in two parts, with α-helices α1–α5 and α8 on one side and α-helices α6–α7 on the other side of the β-sheet (Figs. 1B and 2A). The order of the β-strands is β1–β5–β4–β3–β2–β6, which is a conserved central feature in most papain-like proteases. The protease domain of PaToxPCA shows high similarity to structure and active site architecture of the AvrPphB protease (Table 2, Fig. 2, A and B), which is the only structurally characterized representative of the C58-protease family of YopT peptidases (14Rawlings N.D. Waller M. Barrett A.J. Bateman A. MEROPS: the database of proteolytic enzymes, their substrates and inhibitors.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24157837): D503-50910.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). The alanine substitution of the nucleophilic cysteine in the PaToxPCA variant resides on the conserved position at the N terminus of α-helix α2, a helix that is highly conserved in papain-like proteases (Fig. 2B). His-1955 is located at the N terminus of strand β3 and Asp-1975 is located at the C-terminal end of strand β4. Both are conserved positions within the C58-protease fold. A fourth residue of the active site is Gln-1868 (Fig. 2B). Comparison with structures of selected representatives of papain-like proteases shows superimposition with the respective functional moieties that stabilize the acyl intermediates that form during catalysis within the oxyanion hole of these proteases (Fig. 2B). The loop upstream and downstream of Gln-1868 delineates the oxyanion hole. The structure of this loop varies among proteases and features a helical turn in PaToxPCA.Table 2DALI search showing unique proteins with a Z-score of 5 or higher for the catalytic protease domain (amino acid residues 1843–2114)PDB entryZ-scoreaZ-score, the statistical significance of the similarity between catalytical domain of PaToxP and related proteins; RMSD, root mean square deviation of Cα atoms; lali, number of structurally equivalent residues; nres, total number of amino acid residues in the hit protein; %id, percentage of identical over structurally equivalent amino acid residues.RMSDlalinres%idProteinOrganismÅ11ukf11.52.914118813Avirulence protein AvrPphBPseudomonas22j7q10.03.21422328Herpesvirus tegument protein M48 protease (htpM48P)Human herpesvirus 134ip36.43.812519212Uncharacterized protein ORF169BShigella flexneri45xe95.83.210113616Peptidase domain of ABC-transporter ComAStreptococcus54ry25.43.51056999Peptidase domain of ABC-transporter PCAT1Clostridium62ffg5.22.369809Uncharacterized protein YkuJBacillus subtilis71y4h5.13.410217310Staphopain BStaphylococcus aureus85kdg5.03.41031868Gifsy-2 prophage protein GtgES. typhimurium94d8i5.04.31222547Cysteine protease SpeBStreptococcus pyogenes103bba5.04.61282469Cysteine protease Interpain APrevotella intermediaa Z-score, the statistical significance of the similarity between catalytical domain of PaToxP and related proteins; RMSD, root mean square deviation of Cα atoms; lali, number of structurally equivalent residues; nres, total number of amino acid residues in the hit protein; %id, percentage of identical over structurally equivalent amino acid residues. Open table in a new tab A pronounced residual electron density with a protrusion of distinct tetrahedral shape was present close to the active site. The most likely ligand is a HEPES molecule from the buffered crystallization solution. It was included in the model. A coinciding peak in the anomalous map precisely positioned the sulfur atom (Fig. S3). The hydroxyethylpiperazine moiety is not bound in an ordered manner and its occupancy was thus set to zero, whereas the 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid moiety has a distinct coordination and was refined. The sulfonic acid moiety is coordinated by several H-bonds and is also located close to the N terminus of helix α2, of which the helix dipole provides a partial positive charge (Fig. S3). It is bound next to Ala-1865, which substitutes the catalytic cysteine. The ligand might reflect the binding position of a negatively charged substrate or product. One should note that the canonical oxyanion hole is on the opposite of the catalytic nucleophile position (Fig. 2B). Superimposition of the PaToxP structure with structures of representative papain proteases (papain (PDB code 1PPN), AvrPphB protease (PDB code 1UKF), and staphopain (PDB code 1CV8)) clearly showed a high structural identity for Cys-1865, His-1955, and Asp-1975 with the respective catalytic triads (Figs. S1 and S4). In addition, the oxyanion hole is an important feature for the enzyme activity of such proteases. The superimposition indicates that the constituents of an oxyanion hole are present in PaToxP. The backbone amide group of Cys-1865 and the side chain amide of Gln-1868 are in equivalent positions to form an oxyanion hole. Together they would stabilize the negative charge of the tetrahedral intermediate in the transition state, thus permitting the negatively charged oxygen to react with water (Fig. 2). The glutamine in position 1854 can be replaced by asparagine, aspartic acid, or glutamic acid in other papain proteases. Although the main chain conformation differs between the compared protein structures, the functional group of the side chain always superimposes among the above-mentioned proteases as for most of the proteins revealed by the DALI search (Fig. 2B, Table 2). Taken together, the architecture of the catalytic site of PaToxP is in line with a papain-type protease. The surface of the catalytic domain of PaToxP shows an elongated crevice to both sides of the catalytic nucleophile position, which might form the binding surface for regulatory or substrate proteins (Fig. 3). The electrostatic potential presentation of the surface (Fig. 3A) shows that this groove is mostly electroneutral. The electrostatic potential surface of entire PaToxP is depicted in Fig. 3B. Noteworthy is the pronounced basic surface that is mainly contributed by the elongated α-helix and the β-sheet of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 3B). This strong electropositive surface is the result of the presence of 18 lysine and arginine residues forming a large cluster of basic residues. Similar structures in the Protein Data Bank were searched with the DALI protein structure comparison server (15Holm L. Laakso L.M. Dali server update.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (27131377): W351-W35510.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) using the protease domain only as query structure. Similar structures belong to members of the CA clan of the cysteine protease family (EC 3.4.22). This group of enzymes is present in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and viruses and contains a great diversity of enzymatic functions. The type III-secreted effector AvrPphB from Pseudomonas syringae shows the highest structural similarity to the PaToxP domain with a Z-score of 11.5. AvrPphB belongs to the YopT-like cysteine protease family (Table 2) and shows dual proteolytic activity: autocatalytic cleavage and proteolysis of an intracellular substrate, the serine/threonine kinase PBS1 in the eukaryotic host cell (16Shao F. Merritt P.M. Bao Z. Innes R.W. Dixon J.E. A Yersinia effector and a Pseudomonas avirulence protein define a family of cycteine proteases functioning in bacterial pathogenesis.Cell. 2002; 109 (12062101): 575-58810.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Other structures with high similarity include the herpesvirus tegument protein M48USP that has deubiquitinating activity (Z-score 10.0) (17Schlieker C. Weihofen W.A. Frijns E. Kattenhorn L.M. Gaudet R. Ploegh H.L. Structure of a herpesvirus-encoded cysteine protease reveals a unique class of deubiquitinating enzymes.Mol. Cell. 2007; 25 (17349955): 677-68710.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and OspI/ORF169B, a type III secretion effector from Shigella flexneri that deamidates the ubiquitin ligase Ubc13 (Z-score 6.4) (18Sanada T. Kim M. Mimuro H. Suzuki M. Ogawa M. Oyama A. Ashida H. Kobayashi T. Koyama T. Nagai S. Shibata Y. Gohda J. Inoue J. Mizushima T. Sasakawa C. The Shigella flexneri effector OspI deamidates UBC13 to dampen the inflammatory response.Nature. 2012; 483 (22407319): 623-62610.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In all structures identified, the 6-stranded β-sheet, the conserved N-terminal helix harboring the catalytic cysteine, and the arrangement of the histidine and aspartic acid (in some cases glutamic acid) of the catalytic triad are structurally well aligned (Fig. S4). The surrounding helices diverge and result in the low overall sequence similarity among these enzymes. Injection experiments revealed that PaTox is toxic for Galleria mellonella larvae (Fig. 4) (10Jank T. Bogdanović X. Wirth C. Haaf E. Spoerner M. Böhmer K.E. Steinemann M. Orth J.H. Kalbitzer H.R. Warscheid B. Hunte C. Aktories K. A bacterial toxin catalyzing tyrosine glycosylation of Rho and deamidation of Gq and Gi proteins.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 (24141704): 1273-128010.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After injection of full-length PaTox, the majority of larvae died within 8 days. Larvae injected with a C-terminal–truncated version of PaTox lacking the deamidase domain (PaToxΔD) still died, yet the death of larvae was significantly delayed. Further deletion of the glycosyltransferase domain (PaToxΔGD) or mutation of the glycosyltransferase DXD motif, a di-aspartate motif essential for glycosyltransferase activity and necessary for binding of the donor substrate UDP-GlcNAc, showed no significant toxic activity and larvae behaved as injection control animals. The specific deamidase and glycosyltransferase activities of the truncated constructs were confirmed in vitro assays shown in Fig. S5. Because the construct PaToxΔGD still harbors the protease (P) domain PaToxP, we anticipate that PaToxP alone is not able to kill insects. In larvae experiments, the Rho-inactivating glycosyltransferase domain seems to play the most important role in toxicity. Whether the PaToxP domain is important for the translocation into insect cells, remains unclear and needs to be clarified in future experiments. To assess the activity of the PaToxP domain in mammalian cells, we expressed PaToxP as an EGFP fusion protein in HeLa cells. After 48 h, PaToxP expressing cells showed a significantly increased cell rounding (Fig. 5, A and B). When the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys-1865) was mutated to alanine (PaToxPCA) cell rounding strongly decreased. This indicated that an intact protease domain is crucial for the intracellular effects of PaTox in HeLa cells. Furthermore, staining of the actin cytoskeleton by TRIC-phalloidin revealed a strong cell membrane blebbing phenotype with WT PaToxP (Fig. 5C). In most cases the inner membrane of these bleb vesicles were decorated with cortical actin filaments indicating early events of programmed cell death (Fig. 5C, inset). In contrast to this, the active site cysteine mutant PaToxPCA exhibited strongly reduced cell membrane bleb formation and behaved as the EGFP control. Taken together, ectopic expression of PaToxP seems to be toxic for mammalian cells and results in cell rounding and the induction of membrane bleb formation. Cell morphological effects are strongly supportive for early steps of programmed cell death and seem to be dependent on a catalytically intact protease domain. The catalytic cysteine mutant showed no toxic effects. Interestingly, expression of PaToxP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under an inducible galactose promoter influences neither yeast growth nor does it lead to a toxic phenotype. This was also observed when PaToxP-expressing yeast were cultivated under growth stress conditions as osmotic stress (1 m sorbitol), ER stress (20 mm DTT), salt stress (1 m NaCl, 1 m KCl), signaling stress (0.15% caffeine), and temperature stress (5 °C, 37 °C) conditions (data not shown). Unlike metazoans, induction of apoptosis in unicellular organisms like S. cerevisiae is differently regulated (19Jin C. Reed J.C. Yeast and apoptosis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3 (12042767): 453-45910.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Lack of growth phenotypes in PaToxP-expressing yeast might argue toward an apoptosis induction by PaToxP in mammalian cells, which would corroborate our overexpression experiments in HeLa cells. It is worth mentioning that the related C58-domain of MARTX is also not toxic in yeast but in mammalian cells (12Agarwal S. Agarwal S. Biancucci M. Satchell K.J. Induced autoprocessing of the cytopathic makes caterpillars floppy-like effector domain of the Vibrio vulnificus MARTX toxin.Cell. Microbiol. 2015; 17 (25912102): 1494-150910.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the case of MARTX, a missing toxin processing has been suggested. To analyze the function of the protease domain of PaTox in context of cell intoxication, we cloned and expressed PaToxP separately or in combination with the other C-terminal enzymatic domains as His-tagged proteins (Fig. 6A) and performed cell intoxication experiments (Fig. 6B). As the protein delivery system into mammalian cells, we used the protective antigen (PA), the binding and translocation domain of anthrax toxin (20Blanke S.R. Milne J.C. Benson E.L. Collier R.J. Fused polycationic peptide mediates delivery of diphtheria toxin A chain to the cytosol in the presence of anthrax protective antigen.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Microscopic analyses of HeLa cells after incubation with the toxin fragments for 18 h showed cellular retraction and collapse of the cell body only with constructs containing the Rho-inactivating tyrosine glycosyltransferase (G domain) (Fig. 6B). The deamidase domain (D) or the protease domain (P) alone showed no significant alterations under these conditions. Notably, a combination of all three domains (PaToxPGD) showed in addition to rounding a strong blebbing phenotype compared with the tande"

https://openalex.org/W2903244880,"Background and purpose Central adjudication of serious adverse events (SAEs) can be undertaken in clinical trials, especially for open-label studies where outcome assessment may be at risk of bias. This study explored the effect of central adjudication of SAEs on the safety results of the Efficacy of Nitric Oxide in Stroke (ENOS) Trial. Methods ENOS assigned patients with acute stroke at random to receive either transdermal glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) or no GTN and to Stop or Continue previous antihypertensive treatment. SAEs were reported by local investigators who were not blinded to treatment allocation. Central adjudicators, blinded to treatment allocation, reviewed the investigators reports and used evidence available to confirm or re-categorise the classification of event, likely causality, diagnosis and expectedness of event. Results Of 4011 patients enrolled in ENOS, 1473 SAEs were reported by local investigators; this was reduced to 1444 after the review by adjudicators, with 29 re-classified as not an SAE. There was fair agreement between investigators and adjudicators regarding likely causality, with 808 agreements and 644 disagreements (56% crude agreement, weighted kappa, κ = 0.31). Agreement increased upon dichotomisation of the causality categories, with 1432 agreements and 20 disagreements (99% crude agreement, kappa = 0.54). Repeating the main trial safety analysis with investigator reported events showed that adjudication had no effect on the main trial safety conclusions. Conclusions In a large trial, with many SAEs reported, central adjudication of these events did not affect trial conclusions. This suggests that adjudication of SAEs in a clinical trial where the intervention already has a well-established safety profile may not be necessary. Potential efficiency savings (financial, logistical) can be made through not adjudicating SAEs."
https://openalex.org/W2902895500,"Background We aimed to examine the predictive value of a novel mathematical formula based on the law of conservation of mass in calculating sodium changes in intensive care unit patients and compare its performance with previously published formulae. Methods 178 patients were enrolled from 01/2010 to 10/2013. Plasma and urine were collected in two consecutive 8-hour intervals and the sodium was measured. The predicted sodium concentration was calculated based on previous equations and our formula. The two 8-hour period (epoch 1 and 2) results were compared. Variability of predicted values among the measured range of serum sodium levels were provided by Bland-Altman plots with bias and precision statistics. Comparison of the results was performed with the statistical model of the Percentage Similarity. Results 47.19% patients had dysnatremias. The bias ± SD with 95% limits of agreement for sodium levels were -1.395±3.491 for epoch 1 and -1.623 ±11.1 for epoch 2 period. Bland-Altman analysis for the epoch 1 study period had the following results: -0.8079±3.447 for Adrogué–Madias, 0.56±9.687 for Barsoum–Levine, 0.1412±3.824 for EFWC and 0.294±4.789 for Kurtz–Nguyen formula. The mean similarity, SD and coefficient variation for the methods compared with the measured sodium are: 99.56%, 3.873, 3.89% epoch 1, 99.56%, 1.255, 1.26% for epoch 2, 99.77%, 1.245, 1.26% for Adrogue-Madias, 100.1%, 1.337, 1.34% for Barsoum-Levine, 100.1%, 1.704, 1.7% for Nguyen, 100.1%, 1.370, 1.37% for ECFW formula. Conclusions The law of conservation of mass can be successfully applied for the prediction of sodium changes in critically ill patients."
https://openalex.org/W2903178053,"Our objective was to investigate direct voxel-wise relationship between dose and early MR biomarker changes both within and in the high-dose region surrounding brain metastases following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Specifically, we examined the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-weighted imaging and the contrast transfer coefficient (Ktrans) and volume of extracellular extravascular space (ve) derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data. We investigated 29 brain metastases in 18 patients using 3 T MRI to collect imaging data at day 0, day 3 and day 20 following SRS. The ADC maps were generated by the scanner and Ktrans and ve maps were generated using in-house software for dynamic tracer-kinetic analysis. To enable spatially-correlated voxel-wise analysis, we developed a registration pipeline to register all ADC, Ktrans and ve maps to the planning MRI scan. To interrogate longitudinal changes, we computed absolute ΔADC, ΔKtrans and Δve for day 3 and 20 post-SRS relative to day 0. We performed a Kruskall-Wallice test on each biomarker between time points and investigated dose correlations within the gross tumour volume (GTV) and surrounding high dose region > 12 Gy via Spearman’s rho. Only ve exhibited significant differences between day 0 and 20 (p < 0.005) and day 3 and 20 (p < 0.05) within the GTV following SRS. Strongest dose correlations were observed for ADC within the GTV (rho = 0.17 to 0.20) and weak correlations were observed for ADC and Ktrans in the surrounding > 12 Gy region. Both ΔKtrans and Δve showed a trend with dose at day 20 within the GTV and > 12 Gy region (rho = -0.04 to -0.16). Weak dose-related decreases in Ktrans and ve within the GTV and high dose region at day 20 most likely reflect underlying vascular responses to radiation. Our study also provides a voxel-wise analysis schema for future MR biomarker studies with the goal of elucidating surrogates for radionecrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2903473186,"Highly resistant microorganisms (HRMOs) are of high concern worldwide and are becoming increasingly less susceptible for antibiotics. To study the cost effectiveness of infection prevention measures in long-term care, it is essential to first fully understand the impact of HRMOs. The objective of this study is to identify the costs associated with outbreaks caused by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Dutch long-term care facilities (LTCF).After an outbreak of MRSA, Dutch LTCF can submit a reimbursement form to the Dutch Healthcare Authority (""Nederlandse Zorgautoriteit""; NZa) to get a part of the total costs reimbursed. In this study, we requested NZa forms for financial impact analysis. Details regarding the costs of the outbreak have been extracted from these forms and additionally specific LTCF have been visited in person to validate the data.34 complete reimbursement forms from the period between 2011 and 2016 were received from the NZa and have been included. The median cost per patient per day was estimated at €83.80, varying between €16.89 and €1,820.09. We validated five reimbursement forms by visiting the facility and recalculating the costs. We found a non-significant positive difference of €26.07 compared with the original data (p = 0.068).This study is to our knowledge the first to give a national overview of total costs associated with an MRSA outbreak in LTCF in the Netherlands. Overall, costs per patient per day seem lower than in a hospital setting, although total costs are much higher due to the long term of care."
https://openalex.org/W2903017843,"Schizoempodium mesophyllincola is an eriophyid mite that feeds in leaves of Populus trichocarpa in the central part of this cottonwood tree’s range (i.e., coastal British Columbia, Washington and Oregon) in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of North America, and on some interspecific hybrids planted in short-rotation, intensive forestry in the region. The mite, a leaf vagrant, sucks the contents of spongy mesophyll cells, causing leaf discoloration, or “bronzing.” Here, we investigate the inheritance pattern of resistance to leaf bronzing using a three-generation Populus trichocarpa x P. deltoides hybrid pedigree. We found that resistance to the mite is an exaptation in that its source in two related F2 families of the TxD hybrid pedigree was the non-native host, P. deltoides. Two grandparental genotypes of the latter, ‘ILL-5’ and ‘ILL-129’, were completely free of the bronzing symptom and that phenotype was inherited in a Mendelian manner in the F1 and F2. Resistance to S. mesophyllincola is similar to resistance to many other regional pathogens of P. trichocarpa (e.g., Melampsora occidentalis, Venturia inopina, Sphaerulina populicola, and Taphrina sp.) in that it is inherited from the non-native grandparent (e.g., P. deltoides, P. nigra, or P. maximowiczii) in three-generation, hybrid pedigrees. In addition to finding evidence for Mendelian inheritance, we found two QTLs with LOD scores 5.03 and 3.12 mapped on linkage groups (LG) III and I, and they explained 6.7 and 4.2% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. The LG I QTL is close to, or synonymous with, one for resistance to sap-feeding arthropods and leaf developmental traits as expressed in a British study utilizing the same pedigree."
https://openalex.org/W2902617900,"Candida albicans is a prevalent fungal resident and opportunistic pathogen of humans, exhibiting a variety of ovoid and filamentous morphologies. Anchored within the cell wall of the ovoid yeast form of C. albicans is an abundant glycoprotein termed yeast wall protein 1 (Ywp1). Ywp1 has an antiadhesive effect that may facilitate yeast cell dispersal; it also contributes to the masking of the glucan matrix of the yeast cell wall, potentially providing shielding from recognition by the human immune system. Mature Ywp1 consists of an O-glycosylated core of 378 amino acids associated with an N-glycosylated propeptide that originates from an N-terminal segment of Ywp1. A tribasic (-RRR-) sequence in the immature Ywp1 polypeptide is separated by 8 amino acids from a dibasic (-KR-) sequence that is a canonical site for cleavage by the intracellular endopeptidase Kex2, and cleavage occurs at both of these sites to generate an 11 kilodalton (kDa) propeptide that remains strongly associated with the mature core of Ywp1. Previous studies demonstrated an absence of the 11 kDa propeptide in strains lacking Kex2, but the presence of lesser amounts of a 12 kDa propeptide ostensibly (and paradoxically) arising from cleavage at the dibasic site. Subsequent studies of wild type strains, however, suggested that post-secretion cleavages were carried out in vitro by acid proteases in unbuffered cultures to generate the 12 kDa propeptide. Here, intact and Gfp-tagged Ywp1 are utilized to show that neither of the two multibasic sites is normally cleaved in the absence of Kex2, but that uncleaved Ywp1 is still N-glycosylated and subsequently anchored to the cell wall. This furthers our understanding of the multistep cleavage of this highly conserved sequence, as well as the possible contributions of the cleaved propeptide to the maturation and functioning of Ywp1."
https://openalex.org/W2902641966,"Freezing, an episodic movement breakdown that goes from disrupted gait patterns to complete arrest, is a disabling symptom in Parkinson's disease. Several efforts have been made to objectively identify freezing episodes (FEs), although a standardized methodology to discriminate freezing from normal movement is lacking. Novel mathematical approaches that provide information in the temporal and frequency domains, such as the continuous wavelet transform, have demonstrated promising results detecting freezing, although still with limited effectiveness. We aimed to determine whether a computerized algorithm using the continuous wavelet transform based on baseline (i.e. no movement) rather than on amplitude decrease is more effective detecting freezing. Twenty-six individuals with Parkinson's disease performed two trials of a repetitive stepping-in-place task while they were filmed by a video camera and tracked by a motion capture system. The number of FEs and their total duration were determined from a visual inspection of the videos and from three different computed algorithms. Differences in the number and total duration of the FEs between the video inspection and each of the three methods were obtained. The accuracy to identify the time of occurrence of a FE by each method was also calculated. A significant effect of Method was found for the number (p = 0.016) and total duration (p = 0.013) of the FEs, with the method based on baseline being the closest one to the values reported from the videos. Moreover, the same method was the most accurate in detecting the time of occurrence, and the one reaching the highest sensitivity (88.2%). Findings suggest that threshold detection methods based on baseline and movement amplitude decreases capture different characteristics of Parkinsonian gait, with the first one being more effective at detecting FEs. Moreover, robust approaches that consider both time and frequency characteristics are more sensitive in identifying freezing."
