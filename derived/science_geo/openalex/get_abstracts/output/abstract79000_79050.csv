In contrast, the large alveolar epithelial cells (type II, granular pneumonocyte) are active phagocytic cells. It is proposed that the Clara cell is the main source of pulmonary phospholipid production (presumably surfactant) while the large alveolar cell is responsible for its subsequent breakdown."

https://openalex.org/W1966119336,"The duration of the ""psychophysical time quantum"" measured through the application of a two-state model of successiveness discrimination is equal in magnitude to the modal zero-crossing interval of the alpha rhythm. The two quantities have similar distributions and they are correlated over individuals."

https://openalex.org/W1966675712,"Two alleles of Gdh, the locus specifying the electrophoretic mobility of alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, are found in Drosophila melanogaster. The gene is located on the second chromosome at a map position of 17.8. Hybrid enzyme molecules are found in heterozygotes."

https://openalex.org/W2060857177,"Radioactive aminoacyl transfer RNA's isolated from erythrocytes in the blood of 4-day-old chick embryos and from reticulocytes of adult chickens were analyzed by chromatography on methylated albumin kieselguhr and freon columns. Embryonic and adult methionyl transfer RNA's showed qualitative and quantitative differences in both chromatographic systems. The patterns for arginyl, seryl, and tyrosyl transfer RNA's in the two cell types were similar, while the leucyl transfer RNA patterns suggested a difference."
https://openalex.org/W2053080207,"Single-cell recordings were taken with electrodes permanently implanted in unrestrained rats during normal sleep, paradoxical sleep, quiet awake, and highly motivated awake periods. In most areas, neuronal activity increased when normal sleep changed to paradoxical sleep. The hypothalamus showed a significantly greater increase than most other areas. The hippocampus differed strikingly from all other areas by showing a decrement in all cases. The average firing rates in paradoxical sleep exceeded those of the quiet awake state as well as those of normal sleep. Comparison of paradoxical sleep with motivated behavior illustrated that changes in brain activity during paradoxical sleep were related to anatomically specifiable groupings, but no such differentiation appeared in motivated behavior."

https://openalex.org/W1985610320,"Yeast alanine-tRNA was reacted with 1-cyclohexyl-3-[2-morpholinyl-(4)-ethyl] carbodiimide (14)C-methoiodide in the presence of magnesium ion. The carbodiimide formed addition products with bases in the sequences psipGp, UpCp and UpUpIpGpCp. The expected bases in the sequence TppsipCpGpApUp did not react, although this region is postulated to be in a loop that is not hydrogen-bonded. The capacity of the alanine-tRNA to accept amino acids decreased after reaction with the carbodiimide."

https://openalex.org/W2089536830,"Explants from the mammary glands of 3-week-old mice can be induced to synthesize casein in vitro in the absence of lobuloalveolar development. Maximum biochemical differentiation requires the presence of insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin in the culture medium. In contrast to explants from adult mice, the mammary epithelium of immature animals undergoes DNA synthesis and mitosis in vitro in the absence of exogenous insulin; however, such proliferation does not lead to the formation of differentiated daughter cells. Insulin acts in at least two ways during the proliferative phases of the cell cycle of differentiating mammary epithelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W2072822564,"Mutant cells lackng chlorophyll, chloroplasts, and chloroplast DNA were produced by irradiating Euglena gracilis in aerobic conditions with visible or red light (greater than 610 nanometers) of an intensity equivalent to that of direct sunlight. The photosensitizer is apparently the endogenous chlorophyll present in the chloroplasts. These mutants are comparable to those induced by ultraviolet light, x-rays, heat, or streptomycin. Our findings indicate that visible light can serve as a mutagenic agent in the absence of exogenous photosensitizers, thus directly effecting the course of evolution of organisms containing chlorophyll."

These detailed characteristics will help to establish a more natural faunal classification and will enable more accurate ecologic and biostratigraphic correlations."

https://openalex.org/W2031150546,"This article is based upon data which are suitable for the correlation of behavioral research and experimental neurophysiology. Causal thinking manifests a sort of integrative activity which brings simultaneous and successive patterns of nervous excitation into a subjectively meaningful frame of reference. While neuronal patterns determine the content of consciousness, they fail to provide clues concerning the transformation of such patterns into subjective experience."

https://openalex.org/W2034646363,"A COMMUNICATION on the morphological conversion of cells in vitro by N-nitrosomethylurea by Sanders and Burford1 prompts me to report similar experiments performed about 5 years ago in which the related and very effective carcinogen, N-methyl-N-nitrosourethane (MNU)2 was used. Its action in vitro was tested on various mammalian cells grown in tissue culture. These included the Syrian hamster fibroblast BHK 21/13 C cell line3 made available by Professor M. Stoker, and also fresh cultures of trypsinized baby (or foetal) rat heart fibroblasts. The cultures were maintained in Roux bottles, in Eagle's medium (containing double concentration of amino-acids and vitamins) and Hanks tryptose phosphate broth with 10 per cent calf serum. The cultures were trypsinized and sub-cultured once a week or more often. Explants, 24 h or 48 h old, were used for treatment with MNU of concentrations 1 × 10−2 – 1 × 10−5 molar. For this purpose, the medium was removed from the cultures and replaced by MNU dissolved in ethanol (1 : 10 v/v) and diluted to the desired concentration with phosphate buffer. After 30 or 60 min at 37° C, the MNU solution was decanted, the cultures were washed once with phosphate buffer, and left in fresh medium at 37° C."

https://openalex.org/W1984891731,"ENZYMES may occur in multiple molecular forms or isozymes1, often showing tissue specific variations1–3. In different pathological conditions2 and after certain types of medication4,5, alterations in serum isozyme patterns have been observed. These findings suggest that isozymes may be valuable markers in clinical research, for example, for the identification of the tissue origin of enzymes occurring in pathological levels in various body fluids. High levels of acid phosphatase activity have been reported in the synovial fluid6 and synovial tissue7 of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This report deals with the appearance of certain acid phosphatase isozymes in the knee-joint synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis."
