https://openalex.org/W1974637520,The contribution of eggs to the communal clutch by females of the group and the genetic contribution by males of the group are significantly skewed. The amount of parental care performed by each bird is correlated with relative egg ownership for both sexes.

https://openalex.org/W2002229563,"Earth-approaching asteroids could provide raw materials for space manufacturing. For certain asteroids the total energy per unit mass for the transfer of asteroidal resources to a manufacturing site in high Earth orbit is comparable to that for lunar materials. For logistical reasons the cost may be many times less. Optical studies suggest that these asteroids have compositions corresponding to those of carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites, with some containing large quantities of iron and nickel; others are thought to contain carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen, elements that appear to be lacking on the moon. The prospect that several new candidate asteroids will be discovered over the next few years increases the likelihood that a variety of asteroidal resource materials can be retrieved on low-energy missions."
https://openalex.org/W2058200422,"When frightened by a predator, the plesiopid fish, Calloplesiops altivelis, adopts a posture and appearance that mimics the head of a noxious moray eel, Gymnothorax meleagris. Tests indicate that the mimicry is Batesian and not MÃ¼llerian. Unlike the strategy of other reef-fish prey species, which hide when threatened, the Calloplesiops's strategy is one of intimidation."

The close, staggered arrangement of the platelets is viewed as a physical barrier that can interfere with the diffusion pathway of gas molecules. The result is a more efficient retention of gas pressures within the swimbladder."

https://openalex.org/W2066620805,"An analysis of 11 major federal energy policies of the last half-century indicated a record of conflicting and counter-productive government policies. These policies contributed heavily to the energy crisis. The essence of the President's energy plan is more government interference and less reliance on the price system. Crude oil price controls are to become permanent, and natural gas price controls are to be extended. This requires that government decide who gets the low-priced energy, who pays high prices, and who increasingly goes without. Government energy policies have historically reflected dominant organized pressures."
