Since its discovery, αSyn has been thought to exist normally in cells as an unfolded monomer. We recently reported that αSyn can instead exist in cells as a helically folded tetramer that resists aggregation and binds lipid vesicles more avidly than unfolded recombinant monomers (Bartels, T., Choi, J. G., and Selkoe, D. J. (2011) Nature 477, 107-110). However, a subsequent study again concluded that cellular αSyn is an unfolded monomer (Fauvet, B., Mbefo, M. K., Fares, M. B., Desobry, C., Michael, S., Ardah, M. T., Tsika, E., Coune, P., Prudent, M., Lion, N., Eliezer, D., Moore, D. J., Schneider, B., Aebischer, P., El-Agnaf, O. M., Masliah, E., and Lashuel, H. A. (2012) J. Biol. Chem. 287, 15345-15364). Here we describe a simple in vivo cross-linking method that reveals a major ~60-kDa form of endogenous αSyn (monomer, 14.5 kDa) in intact cells and smaller amounts of ~80- and ~100-kDa forms with the same isoelectric point as the 60-kDa species. Controls indicate that the apparent 60-kDa tetramer exists normally and does not arise from pathological aggregation. The pattern of a major 60-kDa and minor 80- and 100-kDa species plus variable amounts of free monomers occurs endogenously in primary neurons and erythroid cells as well as neuroblastoma cells overexpressing αSyn. A similar pattern occurs for the homologue, β-synuclein, which does not undergo pathogenic aggregation. Cell lysis destabilizes the apparent 60-kDa tetramer, leaving mostly free monomers and some 80-kDa oligomer. However, lysis at high protein concentrations allows partial recovery of the 60-kDa tetramer. Together with our prior findings, these data suggest that endogenous αSyn exists principally as a 60-kDa tetramer in living cells but is lysis-sensitive, making the study of natural αSyn challenging outside of intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W2048296320,"Tumor cells require increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to support anabolism and proliferation. The precise mechanisms regulating this process in tumor cells are unknown. Here, we show that the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and one of its primary ligands, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), are required for optimal mitochondrial function within tumors. We found that RAGE is present in the mitochondria of cultured tumor cells as well as primary tumors. RAGE and HMGB1 coordinately enhanced tumor cell mitochondrial complex I activity, ATP production, tumor cell proliferation and migration. Lack of RAGE or inhibition of HMGB1 release diminished ATP production and slowed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. These findings link, for the first time, the HMGB1-RAGE pathway with changes in bioenergetics. Moreover, our observations provide a novel mechanism within the tumor microenvironment by which necrosis and inflammation promote tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2058916559,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a highly lethal gynaecological malignancy. Cisplatin is the basal chemotherapeutic agent used to treat EOC, but resistance to cisplatin leads to chemotherapy failure. MicroRNAs are a novel class of regulators that function by controlling gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Several recent reports have identified some microRNAs that are related to chemotherapy sensitivity. In this study, we found two microRNAs miR-152 and miR-185 that were significantly downregulated in the cisplatin-resistant ovarian cell lines SKOV3/DDP and A2780/DDP, compared with their sensitive parent line SKOV3 and A2780, respectively. Subsequently, the roles of miR-152 and miR-185 were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The overexpression of miR-152 or miR-185 increased cisplatin sensitivity of SKOV3/DDP and A2780/DDP cells by inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis, then we further confirmed that these miRNAs functioned through suppressing DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) directly. Concordantly, CD-1/CD-1 nude mice that were injected intraperitoneally with SKOV3/DDP cells transfected with miR-152 mimics exhibited upregulated cisplatin sensitivity in vivo. Interestingly, we found that there were no significant changes in the expression of these two microRNAs after treatment with decitabine (DAC), a traditional epigenetic therapeutic agent, suggesting these miRNAs represented two new regulators independent of DAC. Finally, the survival assay in A549 and HepG2 cells revealed that the two microRNAs involved in cisplatin sensitivity were related to cell types. Our results indicated that miR-152 and miR-185 were involved in ovarian cancer cisplatin resistance in vitro and in vivo by targeting DNMT1 directly. These molecules may serve as potential epigenetic therapeutic targets in other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2007126419,"A gene signature specific for intestinal stem cells (ISCs) has recently been shown to predict relapse in colorectal cancer (CRC) but the tumorigenic role of individual signature genes remains poorly defined. A prominent ISC-signature gene is the cancer stem cell marker CD44, which encodes various splice variants comprising a diverse repertoire of adhesion and signaling molecules. Using Lgr5 as ISC marker, we have fluorescence-activated cell sorting-purified ISCs to define their CD44 repertoire. ISCs display a specific set of CD44 variant isoforms (CD44v), but remarkably lack the CD44 standard (CD44s) isoform. These CD44v also stand-out in transformed human ISCs isolated from microadenomas of familial adenomatous polyposis patients. By employing knock-in mice expressing either CD44v4-10 or CD44s, we demonstrate that the CD44v isoform, but not CD44s, promotes adenoma initiation in ApcMin/+mice. Our data identify CD44v as component of the ISCs program critical for tumor initiation, and as potential treatment target in CRC."
https://openalex.org/W1993442614,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small and elusive population of undifferentiated cancer cells within tumors that drive tumor growth and recurrence, are believed to resemble normal stem cells. Although surrogate markers have been identified and compelling CSC theoretical models abound, actual proof for the existence of CSCs can only be had retrospectively. Hence, great store has come to be placed in isolating CSCs from cancers for in-depth analysis. On the other hand, although induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold great promise for regenerative medicine, concern exists over the inadvertent co-transplantation of partially or undifferentiated stem cells with tumorigenic capacity. Here we demonstrate that the introduction of defined reprogramming factors (OCT4, SOX2, Klf4 and c-Myc) into MCF-10A nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells, followed by partial differentiation, transforms the bulk of cells into tumorigenic CD44(+)/CD24(low) cells with CSC properties, termed here as induced CSC-like-10A or iCSCL-10A cells. These reprogrammed cells display a malignant phenotype in culture and form tumors of multiple lineages when injected into immunocompromised mice. Compared with other transformed cell lines, cultured iCSCL-10A cells exhibit increased resistance to the chemotherapeutic compounds, Taxol and Actinomycin D, but higher susceptibility to the CSC-selective agent Salinomycin and the Pin1 inhibitor Juglone. Restored expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a abrogated the CSC properties of iCSCL-10A cells, by inducing cellular senescence. This study provides some insight into the potential oncogenicity that may arise via cellular reprogramming, and could represent a valuable in vitro model for studying the phenotypic traits of CSCs per se."
https://openalex.org/W1995935831,"Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder associated with a bone-marrow failure, cancer predisposition and hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. Majority of the 15 FA genes and encoded proteins characterized so far are integrated into DNA repair pathways, however, other important functions cannot be excluded. FA cells are sensitive to oxidants, and accumulation of oxidized proteins has been characterized for several FA subgroups. Clinical phenotypes of both FA and other closely related diseases suggest altered functions of mitochondria, organelles responsible for cellular energetic metabolism, and also serving as an important producer and the most susceptible target from reactive oxidative species (ROS). In this study, we have shown that elevated level of mitochondrial ROS in FA cells is in parallel with the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, the decrease of ATP production, impaired oxygen uptake and pathological changes in the morphology of mitochondria. This is accompanied by inactivation of enzymes that are essential for the energy production (F1F0ATPase and cytochrome C oxidase) and detoxification of ROS (superoxide dismutase, SOD1). In turn, overexpression of SOD1 could rescue oxygen consumption rate in FA-deficient cells. Importantly, the depletion of mitochondria improved survival rate of mitomycin C treated FA cells suggesting that hypersensitivity of FA cells to chemotherapeutic drugs could be in part due to the mitochondria-mediated oxidative stress. On the basis of our results, we propose that deficiency in FA genes lead to disabling mitochondrial ROS-scavenging machinery further affecting mitochondrial functions and suppressing cell respiration."
https://openalex.org/W2028931661,"B7-H4, a member of B7 family, is a transmembrane protein and inhibits T-cells immunity. However, in a variety of tumor cells, B7-H4 was detected predominantly in intracellular compartments with unknown mechanism and functions. In this study, we analyzed B7-H4 expression and subcellular distribution by immunohistochemistry in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tissues. B7-H4 protein was detected on the membrane, in the cytosol and/or in the nucleus in tumor tissues. The membrane and nuclear expression of B7-H4 was significantly correlated with the tumor stages of RCC. Moreover, the membrane localization of B7-H4 was inversely correlated with the intensity of tumor infiltrates lymphocyte (TILs), whereas no association was observed between nuclear expression of B7-H4 and the density of TILs status. We further identified that B7-H4 is a cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling protein containing a functional nuclear localization sequence (NLS) motif. A point mutation of B7-H4 NLS motif blocked the leptomycin B -induced nuclear accumulation of B7-H4. HEK293 cells stably expressing B7-H4 NLS mutant exhibited more potent inhibition in T-cell proliferation and cytokine production through increasing its surface expression compared with wild-type B7-H4 transfected cells owing to their increased surface expression. Most importantly, overexpression of wild-type B7-H4 in HEK293 cells enhanced tumor cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo, promoted G1/S phase transition. The regulation of cell cycle by wild-type B7-H4 was partialy due to upregulation of Cyclin D 1 and Cyclin E. A mutation of B7-H4 NLS motif abolished the B7-H4-mediated cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation. Furthermore, B7-H4 wild-type confers chemoresistance activity to RCC cell lines including Caki-1 and ACHN. Our study provides a new insight into the functional implication of B7-H4 in its subcellular localization."
https://openalex.org/W2150936706,"The incidence of Barrett’s esophagus (BE)-associated esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is increasing. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to uncover genomic alterations during BE pathogenesis and progression to EAC, but treatment-naive surgical specimens are scarce. The objective of this study was to establish the feasibility of using widely available endoscopic mucosal biopsies for successful NGS, using samples obtained from a BE ‘progressor’. Paired-end whole-genome NGS was performed on the Illumina platform using libraries generated from mucosal biopsies of normal squamous epithelium (NSE), BE and EAC obtained from a patient who progressed to adenocarcinoma during endoscopic surveillance. Selective validation studies, including Sanger sequencing, immunohistochemistry and functional assays, were performed to confirm the NGS findings. NGS identified somatic nonsense mutations of AT-rich interactive domain 1A (SWI like) (ARID1A) and PPIE and an additional 37 missense mutations in BE and/or EAC, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. ARID1A mutations were detected in 15% (3/20) high-grade dysplasia (HGD)/EAC patients. Immunohistochemistry performed on an independent archival cohort demonstrated ARID1A protein loss in 0% (0/76), 4.9% (2/40), 14.3% (4/28), 16.0% (8/50) and 12.2% (12/98) of NSE, BE, low-grade dysplasia, HGD and EAC tissues, respectively, and was inversely associated with nuclear p53 accumulation (P=0.028). Enhanced cell growth, proliferation and invasion were observed on ARID1A knockdown in EAC cells. In addition, genes downstream of ARID1A that potentially contribute to the ARID1A knockdown phenotype were identified. Our studies establish the feasibility of using mucosal biopsies for NGS, which should enable the comparative analysis of larger ‘progressor’ versus ‘non-progressor’ cohorts. Further, we identify ARID1A as a novel tumor-suppressor gene in BE pathogenesis, reiterating the importance of aberrant chromatin in the metaplasia–dysplasia sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2004904415,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) develop sporadically or in the context of neurofibromatosis type 1. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression has been implicated in MPNST formation, but its precise role and relevant signaling pathways remain unknown. We found that EGFR overexpression promotes mouse neurofibroma transformation to aggressive MPNST (GEM-PNST). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) in both human MPNST and mouse GEM-PNST. A specific JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor FLLL32 delayed MPNST formation in an MPNST xenograft nude mouse model. STAT3 knockdown by shRNA prevented MPNST formation in vivo. Finally, reducing EGFR activity strongly reduced pSTAT3 in vivo. Thus, an EGFR–STAT3 pathway is necessary for MPNST transformation and establishment of MPNST xenografts growth but not for tumor maintenance. Efficacy of the FLLL32 pharmacological inhibitor in delaying MPNST growth suggests that combination therapies targeting JAK/STAT3 might be useful therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2043787005,"Huntington disease is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative condition caused by polyglutamine expansion in the N terminus of the huntingtin protein (Htt). The first 17 amino acids (N17) of Htt play a key role in regulating its toxicity and aggregation. Both nuclear export and cytoplasm retention functions have been ascribed to N17. We have determined that N17 acts as a nuclear export sequence (NES) within Htt exon and when fused to yellow fluorescent protein. We have defined amino acids within N17 that constitute the nuclear export sequence (NES). Mutation of any of the conserved residues increases nuclear accumulation of Htt exon 1. Nuclear export of Htt is sensitive to leptomycin B and is reduced by knockdown of exportin 1. In HEK293 cells, NES mutations decrease overall Htt aggregation but increase the fraction of cells with nuclear inclusions. In primary cultured neurons, NES mutations increase nuclear accumulation and increase overall aggregation. This work defines a bona fide nuclear export sequence within N17 and links it to effects on protein aggregation. This may help explain the important role of N17 in controlling Htt toxicity.

https://openalex.org/W2002825673,"Expression of the antioxidant enzyme EcSOD in normal human mammary epithelial cells was not recognized until recently. Although expression of EcSOD was not detectable in non-malignant human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) cultured in conventional two-dimensional (2D) culture conditions, EcSOD protein expression was observed in normal human breast tissues, suggesting that the 2D-cultured condition induces a repressive status of EcSOD gene expression in HMEC. With the use of laminin-enriched extracellular matrix (lrECM), we were able to detect expression of EcSOD when HMEC formed polarized acinar structures in a 3D-culture condition. Repression of the EcSOD-gene expression was again seen when the HMEC acini were sub-cultured as a monolayer, implying that lrECM-induced acinar morphogenesis is essential in EcSOD-gene activation. We have further shown the involvement of DNA methylation in regulating EcSOD expression in HMEC under these cell culture conditions. EcSOD mRNA expression was strongly induced in the 2D-cultured HMEC after treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. In addition, epigenetic analyses showed a decrease in the degree of CpG methylation in the EcSOD promoter in the 3D versus 2D-cultured HMEC. More importantly, >80% of clinical mammary adenocarcinoma samples showed significantly decreased EcSOD mRNA and protein expression levels compared with normal mammary tissues and there is an inverse correlation between the expression levels of EcSOD and the clinical stages of breast cancer. Combined bisulfite restriction analysis analysis of some of the tumors also revealed an association of DNA methylation with the loss of EcSOD expression in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of EcSOD inhibited breast cancer metastasis in both the experimental lung metastasis model and the syngeneic mouse model. This study suggests that epigenetic silencing of EcSOD may contribute to mammary tumorigenesis and that restoring the extracellular superoxide scavenging activity could be an effective strategy for breast cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2043854332,"TAM family receptor tyrosine kinases comprising Tyro3 (Sky), Axl, and Mer are overexpressed in some cancers, correlate with multidrug resistance and contribute to tumourigenesis by regulating invasion, angiogenesis, cell survival and tumour growth. Mutations in the gene coding for a tumour suppressor merlin cause development of multiple tumours of the nervous system such as schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas occurring spontaneously or as part of a hereditary disease neurofibromatosis type 2. The benign character of merlin-deficient tumours makes them less responsive to chemotherapy. We previously showed that, amongst other growth factor receptors, TAM family receptors (Tyro3, Axl and Mer) are significantly overexpressed in schwannoma tissues. As Axl is negatively regulated by merlin and positively regulated by E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4DCAF1, previously shown to be a key regulator in schwannoma growth we hypothesized that Axl is a good target to study in merlin-deficient tumours. Moreover, Axl positively regulates the oncogene Yes-associated protein, which is known to be under merlin regulation in schwannoma and is involved in increased proliferation of merlin-deficient meningioma and mesothelioma. Here, we demonstrated strong overexpression and activation of Axl receptor as well as its ligand Gas6 in human schwannoma primary cells compared to normal Schwann cells. We show that Gas6 is mitogenic and increases schwannoma cell-matrix adhesion and survival acting via Axl in schwannoma cells. Stimulation of the Gas6/Axl signalling pathway recruits Src, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and NFκB. We showed that NFκB mediates Gas6/Axl-mediated overexpression of survivin, cyclin D1 and FAK, leading to enhanced survival, cell-matrix adhesion and proliferation of schwannoma. We conclude that Axl/FAK/Src/NFκB pathway is relevant in merlin-deficient tumours and is a potential therapeutic target for schwannoma and other merlin-deficient tumours."
https://openalex.org/W1979990247,"The WASF3 gene promotes invasion and metastasis in breast cancer cells, which have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchyme transition (EMT). Overexpression of WASF3 in cells that do not show EMT increases their invasion potential as a result of increased ZEB1/2 levels, which specifically suppress the anti-invasion chromosome 1 miR-200a/200b/429 cluster. ZEB1/2 upregulation by WASF3 results from downregulation of KISS1, leading to the release of inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)κB by IκBα. We further show that ZEB1 expression is regulated by the NFκB transcription factor. Knockdown of WASF3 in breast cancer cells leads to reduced ZEB1 levels and increased miR-200 and E-cadherin levels, resulting in loss of invasion potential. The central regulation of this interactive pathway by WASF3 accounts for the increased invasion associated with increased WASF3 expression seen in aggressive breast cancer cells. WASF3, therefore, is a potential target to suppress invasion and metastasis in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1965049147,"Aberrant expression of the oncogenic Kirsten-Ras (Ki-Ras) and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) pathways is common in breast and other cancers. However, whether these dysregulated pathways cooperate to promote malignancy is not known. This study links Ki-Ras and ISG15 in a previously unidentified regulatory loop that may underlie malignant transformation of mammary cells. We show that oncogenic Ki-Ras regulates the expression of the ISG15 pathway (free ISG15 and ISG15 conjugates), and ISG15, in turn, stabilizes Ki-Ras protein by inhibiting its targeted degradation via lysosomes in breast cancer cells. Disruption of this loop by silencing either Ki-Ras or the ISG15 pathway restored the disrupted cellular architecture, a hallmark feature of most cancer cells. We also demonstrate that ISG15 and UbcH8 (ISG15-specific conjugating enzyme) shRNAs reversed Ki-Ras mutation-associated phenotypes of cancer cells, such as increased cell proliferation, colony formation, anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, cell migration, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition. As UbcH8-silenced breast cancer cells are devoid of ISG15 conjugates but have free ISG15, our results using UbcH8-silenced cells suggest that ISG15 conjugates, and not free ISG15, contributes to oncogenic Ki-Ras transformation. We have thus identified the conjugated form of ISG15 as a critical downstream mediator of oncogenic Ki-Ras, providing a potential mechanistic link between ISG15 and Ki-Ras-mediated breast tumorigenesis. Our findings, which show that inhibition of the ISGylation reverses the malignant phenotypes of breast cancer cells expressing oncogenic Ki-Ras, support the development of ISG15 conjugation inhibitors for treating breast and also other cancers expressing oncogenic Ki-Ras."
https://openalex.org/W2091496750,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths and is the most occurring malignancy worldwide. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms involved in lung tumorigenesis will greatly improve therapy. During early tumorigenesis, rapid proliferating tumor cells require increased activity of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for protein synthesis, folding and secretion, thereby are subjected to ER stress. Ribosome-binding protein 1 (RRBP1) was originally identified as a ribosome-binding protein located on the rough ER and associated with unfolding protein response (UPR). In this report, we investigated the role of RRBP1 in lung cancer. RRBP1 was highly expressed in lung cancer tissue, as compared with adjacent normal tissues as assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using lung cancer tissue array (n=87). Knockdown of RRBP1 by short-hairpin RNAs caused ER stress and significantly reduced cell viability and tumorigenicity. This effect was associated with a significant reduction in the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78). UPR regulator GRP78, an anti-apoptotic protein that is widely upregulated in cancer, has a critical role in chemotherapy resistance in some cancers. According to our results, cells with a higher level of RRBP1 were more resistant to ER stress. Ectopic expression of RRBP1 alleviated apoptosis that was induced by the ER-stress agent tunicamycin, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) or doxorubicin via enhancing GRP78 protein expression. A strong correlation was observed between the expression of RRBP1 and GRP78 in tumor biopsies using the database GSE10072. Our results also indicated that RRBP1 may involve in the regulation of mRNA stability of UPR components including ATF6 and GRP78. Taken together, RRBP1 could alleviate ER stress and help cancer cell survive. RRBP1 is critical for tumor cell survival, which may make it a useful target in lung cancer treatment and a candidate for the development of new targeted therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2000184493,"Translational regulation of the p53 mRNA can determine the ratio between p53 and its N-terminal truncated isoforms and therefore has a significant role in determining p53-regulated signaling pathways. Although its importance in cell fate decisions has been demonstrated repeatedly, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms that determine this ratio. Two internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) residing within the 5’UTR and the coding sequence of p53 mRNA drive the translation of full-length p53 and Δ40p53 isoform, respectively. Here, we report that DAP5, a translation initiation factor shown to positively regulate the translation of various IRES containing mRNAs, promotes IRES-driven translation of p53 mRNA. Upon DAP5 depletion, p53 and Δ40p53 protein levels were decreased, with a greater effect on the N-terminal truncated isoform. Functional analysis using bicistronic vectors driving the expression of a reporter gene from each of these two IRESs indicated that DAP5 preferentially promotes translation from the second IRES residing in the coding sequence. Furthermore, p53 mRNA expressed from a plasmid carrying this second IRES was selectively shifted to lighter polysomes upon DAP5 knockdown. Consequently, Δ40p53 protein levels and the subsequent transcriptional activation of the 14-3-3σ gene, a known target of Δ40p53, were strongly reduced. In addition, we show here that DAP5 interacts with p53 IRES elements in in vitro and in vivo binding studies, proving for the first time that DAP5 directly binds a target mRNA. Thus, through its ability to regulate IRES-dependent translation of the p53 mRNA, DAP5 may control the ratio between different p53 isoforms encoded by a single mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2110166708,"To date, parathyroid hormone is the only clinically available bone anabolic drug. The major difficulty in the development of such drugs is the lack of clarification of the mechanisms regulating osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Here, we report a peptide (W9) known to abrogate osteoclast differentiation in vivo via blocking receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-RANK signaling that we surprisingly found exhibits a bone anabolic effect in vivo. Subcutaneous administration of W9 three times/day for 5 days significantly augmented bone mineral density in mouse cortical bone. Histomorphometric analysis showed a decrease in osteoclastogenesis in the distal femoral metaphysis and a significant increase in bone formation in the femoral diaphysis. Our findings suggest that W9 exerts bone anabolic activity. To clarify the mechanisms involved in this activity, we investigated the effects of W9 on osteoblast differentiation/mineralization in MC3T3-E1 (E1) cells. W9 markedly increased alkaline phosphatase (a marker enzyme of osteoblasts) activity and mineralization as shown by alizarin red staining. Gene expression of several osteogenesis-related factors was increased in W9-treated E1 cells. Addition of W9 activated p38 MAPK and Smad1/5/8 in E1 cells, and W9 showed osteogenesis stimulatory activity synergistically with BMP-2 in vitro and ectopic bone formation. Knockdown of RANKL expression in E1 cells reduced the effect of W9. Furthermore, W9 showed a weak effect on RANKL-deficient osteoblasts in alkaline phosphatase assay. Taken together, our findings suggest that this peptide may be useful for the treatment of bone diseases, and W9 achieves its bone anabolic activity through RANKL on osteoblasts accompanied by production of several autocrine factors."
https://openalex.org/W1982737320,"Pancreatic cancer is among the top five deadliest cancers in developed countries. Better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms contributing to its tumorigenesis is imperative to improve patient prognosis. Identification of novel tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in pancreatic cancer will reveal new mechanisms of pathway deregulation and will ultimately help improve our understanding of this aggressive disease. According to Knudson's two-hit model, TSGs are classically disrupted by two concerted genetic events. In this study, we combined DNA methylation profiling with copy number and mRNA expression profiling to identify novel TSGs in a set of 20 pancreatic cancer cell lines. These data sets were integrated for each of ∼12 000 genes in each cell line enabling the elucidation of those genes that undergo DNA hypermethylation, copy-number loss and mRNA downregulation simultaneously in multiple cell lines. Using this integrative genomics strategy, we identified SOX15 (sex determining region Y-box 15) as a candidate TSG in pancreatic cancer. Expression of SOX15 in pancreatic cancer cell lines with undetectable expression resulted in reduced viability of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo demonstrating its tumor suppressive capability. We also found reduced expression, homozygous deletion and aberrant DNA methylation of SOX15 in clinical pancreatic tumor data sets. Furthermore, we deduced a novel role for SOX15 in suppressing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which we hypothesize is a pathway through which SOX15 may exert its tumor suppressive effects in pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1975923812,"Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we were interested in knowing whether the oncogene Lin28A and its homolog Lin28B are involved in the hepatocarcinogenesis mediated by HBx. We showed that the expression levels of Lin28A and Lin28B were increased in clinical HCC tissues, HepG2.2.15 cell line and liver tissues of p21-HBx transgenic mice. Interestingly, the expression levels of HBx were positively associated with those of Lin28A/Lin28B in clinical HCC tissues. Moreover, the overexpression of HBx resulted in the upregulation of Lin28A/Lin28B in hepatoma HepG2/H7402 cell lines by transient transfection, suggesting that HBx was able to upregulate Lin28A and Lin28B. Then, we examined the mechanism by which HBx upregulated Lin28A and Lin28B. We identified that the promoter region of Lin28A regulated by HBx was located at nt -235/-66 that contained Sp-1 binding element. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that HBx was able to interact with Sp-1 in HepG2-X cells. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrated that HBx could bind to the promoter of Lin28A, which failed to work when Sp-1 was silenced. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) further identified that HBx was able to interact with Sp-1 element in Lin28A promoter via transcription factor Sp-1. In addition, we found that c-Myc was involved in the activation of Lin28B mediated by HBx. In function, Lin28A/Lin28B played important roles in HBx-enhanced proliferation of hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, HBx activates Lin28A/Lin28B through Sp-1/c-Myc in hepatoma cells. Lin28A/Lin28B serves as key driver genes in HBx-induced hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2022910430,"The circadian oscillator controls time-of-day gene expression by a network of interconnected feedback loops and is reset by light. The requisite for chromatin regulation in eukaryotic transcription necessitates temporal regulation of histone-modifying and chromatin-remodeling enzymes for proper clock function. CHD1 is known to bind H3K4me3 in mammalian cells, and Neurospora CHD1 is required for proper regulation of the frequency (frq) gene. Based on this, we examined a strain lacking SET1 to determine the role of H3K4 methylation in clock- and light-mediated frq regulation. Expression of frq was altered in strains lacking set1 under both circadian- and light-regulated gene expression. There is a delay in the phasing of H3K4me3 relative to the peak in frq expression. White Collar 2 (WC-2) association with the frq promoter persists longer in Δset1, suggesting a more permissible chromatin state. Surprisingly, SET1 is required for DNA methylation in the frq promoter, indicating a dependence on H3K4me for DNA methylation. The data support a model where SET1 is needed for proper regulation by modulating chromatin at frq."

RNF2 is highly expressed in many tumors, suggesting that it might have an oncogenic function, but the mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that knockdown of RNF2 significantly inhibits both cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar, and induces apoptosis in cancer cells. Knockdown of RNF2 in HCT116 p53(+/+) cells resulted in significantly more apoptosis than was observed in RNF2 knockdown HCT116 p53(-/-) cells, indicating that RNF2 knockdown-induced apoptosis is partially dependent on p53. Various p53-targeted genes were increased in RNF2 knockdown cells. Further studies revealed that in RNF2 knockdown cells, the p53 protein level was increased, the half-life of p53 was prolonged and p53 ubiquitination was decreased. In contrast, cells overexpressing RNF2 showed a decreased p53 protein level, a shorter p53 half-life and increased p53 ubiquitination. Importantly, we found that RNF2 directly binds with both p53 and MDM2 and promotes MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. RNF2 overexpression could also increase the half-life of MDM2 and inhibit its ubiquitination. The regulation on p53 and MDM2 stability by RNF2 was also observed during the etoposide-induced DNA damage response. These results provide a possible mechanism explaining the oncogenic function of RNF2, and because RNF2 is important for cancer cell survival and proliferation, it might be an ideal target for cancer therapy or prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2142149788,"Ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) releases Ca(2+) from intracellular stores upon nerve impulse to trigger skeletal muscle contraction. Effector binding at the cytoplasmic domain tightly controls gating of the pore domain of RyR1 to release Ca(2+). However, the molecular mechanism that links effector binding to channel gating is unknown due to lack of structural data. Here, we used a combination of computational and electrophysiological methods and cryo-EM densities to generate structural models of the open and closed states of RyR1. Using our structural models, we identified an interface between the pore-lining helix (Tyr-4912-Glu-4948) and a linker helix (Val-4830-Val-4841) that lies parallel to the cytoplasmic membrane leaflet. To test the hypothesis that this interface controls RyR1 gating, we designed mutations in the linker helix to stabilize either the open (V4830W and T4840W) or closed (H4832W and G4834W) state and validated them using single channel experiments. To further confirm this interface, we designed mutations in the pore-lining helix to stabilize the closed state (Q4947N, Q4947T, and Q4947S), which we also validated using single channel experiments. The channel conductance and selectivity of the mutations that we designed in the linker and pore-lining helices were indistinguishable from those of WT RyR1, demonstrating our ability to modulate RyR1 gating without affecting ion permeation. Our integrated computational and experimental approach significantly advances the understanding of the structure and function of an unusually large ion channel."
https://openalex.org/W2011744268,"The TRIM family of genes is largely studied because of their roles in development, differentiation and host cell antiviral defenses; however, roles in cancer biology are emerging. Loss of heterozygosity of the TRIM3 locus in ∼20% of human glioblastomas raised the possibility that this NHL-domain containing member of the TRIM gene family might be a mammalian tumor suppressor. Consistent with this, reducing TRIM3 expression increased the incidence of and accelerated the development of platelet-derived growth factor -induced glioma in mice. Furthermore, TRIM3 can bind to the cdk inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1. Thus, we conclude that TRIM3 is a tumor suppressor mapping to chromosome 11p15.5 and that it might block tumor growth by sequestering p21 and preventing it from facilitating the accumulation of cyclin D1–cdk4."
https://openalex.org/W2018244151,"Shp2 is a positive regulator for Erk activation downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases for growth factors. It has been controversial how Shp2 induces Erk activation. We here demonstrate that EphA2 is responsible for Shp2-mediated Erk activation by phosphorylating Tyr542 and Tyr580 of Shp2 in the cells stimulated with growth factors. In NMuMG mammary epithelial cells stimulated with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), HGF-dependent Erk phosphorylation was prolonged only in the presence of EphA2. This Erk activation paralleled the phosphorylation of Tyr542/580 of Shp2 and the association of Grb2 with Shp2, suggesting the positive signal involving Grb2 signal to activate Ras-Erk pathway. Immunohistochemical studies of mammary cancer specimens revealed that the cancer progression was associated with both Tyr580 phosphorylation of Shp2 and increased expression of EphA2, which were also correlated with increased Erk phosphorylation. Overexpression of either Shp2Thr468Met (a phosphatase-defective mutant found in Lentigines, Electrocardiographic abnormalities, Ocular hypertelorism, Pulmonary stenosis, Abnormal genitalia, Retardation of growth and sensorineural Deafness (LEOPARD) syndrome) or Shp2Asn308Asp (a phosphatase-active mutant found in Noonan syndrome) with EphA2 exhibited comparable activation of Erk and stronger activation than wild-type Shp2, suggesting the phosphatase-independent Erk activation. Expression of Shp2Thr468Met with Tyr542/580Phe mutations resulted in the suppression of Erk activation. Phosphatase-active and -inactive, and wild-type Shp2s bound equally to Grb2, suggesting that phosphorylation of Tyr542/580 of Shp2 was essential but not sufficient for Shp2-mediated Erk activation. We found that Gab1 (Grb2-associated binder 1) was involved in the mutant Shp2-mediated Erk activation. Zebrafish injected with Shp2Thr468Met mRNA showed cardiac edema, whereas those depleted of EphA2b showed less phenotype, suggesting that EphA2 might partly account for the phenotype of LEOPARD syndrome. Collectively, tyrosine phosphorylation of Shp2 by EphA2 contributes to the phosphatase-independent Shp2-mediated activation of Erk and might be involved in Shp2-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2069805384,"Proton-gated TASK-3 K(+) channel belongs to the K(2P) family of proteins that underlie the K(+) leak setting the membrane potential in all cells. TASK-3 is under cooperative gating control by extracellular [H(+)]. Use of recently solved K(2P) structures allows us to explore the molecular mechanism of TASK-3 cooperative pH gating. Tunnel-like side portals define an extracellular ion pathway to the selectivity filter. We use a combination of molecular modeling and functional assays to show that pH-sensing histidine residues and K(+) ions mutually interact electrostatically in the confines of the extracellular ion pathway. K(+) ions modulate the pK(a) of sensing histidine side chains whose charge states in turn determine the open/closed transition of the channel pore. Cooperativity, and therefore steep dependence of TASK-3 K(+) channel activity on extracellular pH, is dependent on an effect of the permeant ion on the channel pH(o) sensors."
https://openalex.org/W2025703404,"Although the combined use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate confers important clinical benefits in patients with heart failure, the underlying mechanism of action is still controversial. We used two models of nitroso-redox imbalance, neuronal NO synthase-deficient (NOS1(-/-)) mice and spontaneously hypertensive heart failure rats, to test the hypothesis that hydralazine (HYD) alone or in combination with nitroglycerin (NTG) or isosorbide dinitrate restores Ca(2+) cycling and contractile performance and controls superoxide production in isolated cardiomyocytes. The response to increased pacing frequency was depressed in NOS1(-/-) compared with wild type myocytes. Both sarcomere length shortening and intracellular Ca(2+) transient (Δ[Ca(2+)]i) responses in NOS1(-/-) cardiomyocytes were augmented by HYD in a dose-dependent manner. NTG alone did not affect myocyte shortening but reduced Δ[Ca(2+)]i across the range of pacing frequencies and increased myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity thereby enhancing contractile efficiency. Similar results were seen in failing myocytes from the heart failure rat model. HYD alone or in combination with NTG reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) leak, improved SR Ca(2+) reuptake, and restored SR Ca(2+) content. HYD and NTG at low concentrations (1 μm), scavenged superoxide in isolated cardiomyocytes, whereas in cardiac homogenates, NTG inhibited xanthine oxidoreductase activity and scavenged NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide more efficiently than HYD. Together, these results revealed that by reducing SR Ca(2+) leak, HYD improves Ca(2+) cycling and contractility impaired by nitroso-redox imbalance, and NTG enhanced contractile efficiency, restoring cardiac excitation-contraction coupling."
https://openalex.org/W1988443105,"ErbB2 is frequently highly expressed in premalignant breast cancers, including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); however, little is known about the signals or pathways it contributes to progression into the invasive/malignant state. Radiotherapy is often used to treat early premalignant lesions regardless of ErbB2 status. Here, we show that clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation (IR)-induce cellular invasion of ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells, as well as MCF10A cells overexpressing ErbB2. ErbB2-negative breast cancer cells, such as MCF7 and T47D, do not invade following treatment with IR nor do MCF10A cells overexpressing epidermal growth factor receptor. ErbB2 becomes phosphorylated at tyrosine 877 in a dose- and time- dependent manner following exposure to X-rays, and activates downstream signaling cascades including PI3K/Akt. Inhibition of these pathways, as well as inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with antioxidants, prevents IR-induced invasion. Activation of ErbB2-dependent signaling results in upregulation of the forkhead family transcription factor, FoxM1, and its transcriptional targets, including matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). Inhibition of FoxM1 by RNA interference prevented induction of invasion by IR, and overexpression of FoxM1 in MCF10A cells was sufficient to promote IR-induced invasion. Moreover, we found that 14-3-3ζ is also upregulated by IR in cancer cells in a ROS-dependent manner, is required for IR-induced invasion in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells and together with FoxM1 is sufficient for invasion in ErbB2-negative breast cancer cells. Thus, our data show that IR-mediated activation of ErbB2 and induction of 14-3-3ζ collaborate to regulate FoxM1 and promote invasion of breast cancer cells and furthermore, may serve as therapeutic targets to enhance radiosensitivity of breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2044511084,"The proinflammatory danger signal IL-33, which is released from damaged or dying cells, achieves its effects via the IL-1R family member ST2L. The detection of IL-33 by ST2L initiates downstream signaling pathways that result in the activation of MAPKs and NF-κB. Here, we show that TMED1 associates with ST2L. Using a series of mutation and deletion constructs, we demonstrate that this interaction is mediated by the GOLD domain of TMED1 and the TIR domain of ST2L. Our findings also demonstrate that TMED1 is required for optimal IL-33-induced IL-8 and IL-6 production. This discovery provides additional support to the concept that the TMED family members are important players in innate immune signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2108934215,"To identify novel signaling pathways necessary for rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) survival, we performed a loss-of-function screen using an inducible small hairpin RNA (shRNA) library in an alveolar and an embryonal RMS cell line. This screen identified CRKL expression as necessary for growth of alveolar RMS and embryonal RMS both in vitro and in vivo. We also found that CRKL was uniformly highly expressed in both RMS cell lines and tumor tissue. As CRKL is a member of the CRK adapter protein family that contains an SH2 and two SH3 domains and is involved in signal transduction from multiple tyrosine kinase receptors, we evaluated CRKL interaction with multiple tyrosine kinase receptor signaling pathways in RMS cells. While we saw no interaction of CRKL with IGFIR, MET or PI3KAKT/mTOR pathways, we determined that CRKL signaling was associated with SRC family kinase (SFK) signaling, specifically with YES kinase. Inhibition of SFK signaling with dasatinib or another SFK inhibitor, sarcatinib, suppressed RMS cell growth in vitro and in vivo. These data identify CRKL as a novel critical component of RMS growth. This study also demonstrates the use of functional screening to identify a potentially novel therapeutic target and treatment approach for these highly aggressive pediatric cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1977643424,"ORAOV1 (oral cancer overexpressed) is overexpressed in many solid tumours, making a key contribution to the development of cancer, but the cellular role of ORAOV1 is unknown. The yeast orthologue of this protein is encoded by the hitherto uncharacterized essential gene, YNL260c. Expression of ORAOV1 restores viability to yeast cells lacking YNL260c. Under nonpermissive conditions, our conditional mutants of YNL260c are defective in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, whereas maturation of the 40S subunit is unaffected. Also, initiation of translation is abrogated when YNL260c function is lost. YNL260c is indispensible for life in oxygen, but is nonessential under anaerobic conditions. Consequently, the toxic affects of aerobic metabolism on biogenesis and function of the ribosome are alleviated by YNL260c, hence, we rename YNL260c as LTO1; required for biogenesis of the large ribosomal subunit and initiation of translation in oxygen. Lto1 is found in a complex with Rli1/ABCE1, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-ATPase bearing N-terminal [4Fe-4S] clusters. Like Lto1, the Rli1/ABCE1 [4Fe-4S] clusters are not required for viability under anaerobic conditions, but are essential in the presence of oxygen. Loss of Lto1 function renders cells susceptible to hydroperoxide pro-oxidants, though this type of sensitivity is specific to certain types of oxidative stress as the lto1 mutants are not sensitive to an agent that oxidizes thiols. These findings reflect a functional interaction between Lto1 and the Rli1/ABCE1 [4Fe-4S] clusters, as part of a complex, which relieves the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on biogenesis and function of the ribosome. This complex also includes Yae1, which bridges the interaction between Lto1 and Rli1/ABCE1. Interactions between members of this complex were demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro. An increased generation of ROS is a feature shared by many cancers. The ORAOV1 complex could prevent ROS-induced ribosomal damage, explaining why overexpression of ORAOV1 is so common in solid tumours."
https://openalex.org/W1990705108,"The phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) pathway is dysregulated in multiple myeloma (MM); we therefore tested a highly selective class I PI3K inhibitor, GDC-0941, for anti-myeloma activity. Functional and mechanistic studies were first performed in MM cell lines, then extended to primary MM patient samples cultured in vitro. GDC-0941 was then assessed as a single agent and in various combinations in myeloma tumor xenograft models. We show p110 α and β are the predominant PI3K catalytic subunits in MM and that a highly selective class I PI3K inhibitor, GDC-0941, has robust activity as a single agent to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of both MM cell lines and patient myeloma cells. Mechanistic studies revealed an induction of cell cycle arrest at G0/G1, with decreased phospho-FoxO1/3a levels, decreased cyclin D1 and c-myc expression, and an increase in the cell cycle inhibitor, p27kip. Induction of apoptosis correlated with increased expression of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein BIM, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). In vitro, GDC-0941 synergized with dexamethasone (Dex) and lenalidomide (combination index values of 0.3-0.4 and 0.4-0.8, respectively); in vivo GDC-0941 has anti-myeloma activity and significantly increases the activity of the standard of care agents in several murine xenograft tumor models (additional tumor growth inhibition of 37-53% (Dex) and 22-72% (lenalidomide)).

https://openalex.org/W1964505185,"Histone acetyltransferase binding to origin recognition complex (HBO1) plays a crucial role in DNA replication licensing and cell proliferation, yet its molecular regulation in cells is relatively unknown. Here an uncharacterized protein, Fbxw15, directly interacts with HBO1, a labile protein (t&frac12; = ∼3 h), to mediate its ubiquitination (Lys(338)) and degradation in the cytoplasm. Fbxw15-mediated HBO1 depletion required mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (Mek1), which was sufficient to trigger HBO1 phosphorylation and degradation in cells. Mek1 ability to produce HBO1 degradation was blocked by Fbxw15 silencing. Lipopolysaccharide induced HBO1 degradation, an effect abrogated by Fbxw15 or Mek1 cellular depletion. Modulation of Fbxw15 levels was able to differentially regulate histone H3K14 acetylation and cellular proliferation by altering HBO1 levels. These studies authenticate Fbxw15 as a ubiquitin E3 ligase subunit that mediates endotoxin-induced HBO1 depletion in cells, thereby controlling cell replicative capacity."

BMP signaling inhibits precocious neural differentiation and allows for proper differentiation of mesoderm, endoderm, and epidermis. However, the mechanisms underlying the BMP pathway-mediated cell fate decision remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the expression of Ovol2, which encodes an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger transcription factor, is down-regulated during neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. Knockdown of Ovol2 in embryonic stem cells facilitates neural conversion and inhibits mesendodermal differentiation, whereas Ovol2 overexpression gives rise to the opposite phenotype. Moreover, Ovol2 knockdown partially rescues the neural inhibition and mesendodermal induction by BMP4. Mechanistic studies further show that BMP4 directly regulates Ovol2 expression through the binding of Smad1/5/8 to the second intron of the Ovol2 gene. In the chick embryo, cOvol2 expression is specifically excluded from neural territory and is up-regulated by BMP4. In addition, ectopic expression of cOvol2 in the prospective neural plate represses the expression of the definitive neural plate marker cSox2.

In early mouse embryogenesis, the three germ layers are generated through a process known as gastrulation, which commences at embryonic day 6.5 with the appearance of the primitive streak. During gastrulation, some epiblast cells ingress through the primitive streak to form the mesoderm and endoderm, whereas the remaining cells become ectoderm cells, which differentiate into either neuroectoderm or epidermis (1Gadue P.

Because the germ layers contribute to all of the progenitor cells to form the whole embryo, the accurate control of cell fate decisions among different germ layers is crucial for proper embryonic development.

In mouse embryos, depletion of BMPRIA (BMP type IA receptor) leads to a premature loss of pluripotency, precocious neuroectoderm differentiation, and impaired mesoderm differentiation (7Di-Gregorio A.

Despite the extensive study in signaling pathways, few transcription factors have been uncovered to play essential roles in regulating the decision between the neuroectoderm and mesendoderm/mesoderm cell fates. Tbx6 is essential for the regulation of Sox2 expression, which controls the cell fate decision between the caudal neural plate and the paraxial mesoderm in the mouse embryo (18Takemoto T. Uchikawa M.

Ablation of the Ovol2 gene leads to embryonic lethality before embryonic day 10.5, indicating that Ovol2 is involved in early embryonic development (26Mackay D.R. Hu M. Li B. Rhéaume C. Dai X. The mouse Ovol2 gene is required for cranial neural tube development.Dev. Biol. 2006; 291: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Unezaki S. Horai R. Sudo K. Iwakura Y. Ito S. Ovol2/Movo, a homologue of Drosophila ovo, is required for angiogenesis, heart formation, and placental development in mice.Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 773-785PubMed Google Scholar). In Ovol2-null mice, the neuroectoderm was expanded in the cranial region, which caused a failure of cranial neural tube closure (26Mackay D.R. Hu M. Li B. Rhéaume C. Dai X. The mouse Ovol2 gene is required for cranial neural tube development.Dev. Biol. 2006; 291: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, heart development and extraembryonic and embryonic vascularization were also severely affected (26Mackay D.R. Hu M. Li B. Rhéaume C. Dai X. The mouse Ovol2 gene is required for cranial neural tube development.Dev. Biol. 2006; 291: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Unezaki S. Horai R. Sudo K. Iwakura Y. Ito S. Ovol2/Movo, a homologue of Drosophila ovo, is required for angiogenesis, heart formation, and placental development in mice.Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 773-785PubMed Google Scholar). However, the functions of Ovol2 in the early cell fate specification between neuroectoderm and mesendoderm have not been addressed. In human keratinocytes, OVOL1 was identified as a downstream target of the TGF-β/BMP7-Smad4 signaling pathway (28Kowanetz M. Valcourt U. Bergström R. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Id2 and Id3 define the potency of cell proliferation and differentiation responses to transforming growth factor β and bone morphogenetic protein.Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 4241-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It remains unknown whether Ovol2 is also regulated by BMP signals. Here, we identify Ovol2 as a novel target gene downstream of BMP signaling to regulate the cell fate decision between neuroectoderm and mesendoderm. In mouse ESCs, Ovol2 is directly up-regulated by BMP4 and partially mediates BMP4 function to inhibit neural conversion and promote mesodermal and endodermal differentiation. In vivo, chick Ovol2 (cOvol2) expression is excluded from neural territory and is up-regulated by BMP4. Ectopic expression of cOvol2 in the prospective neural plate inhibits neural specification in the early chick embryo. The mouse Ovol2A cDNA was inserted into pIRES2-EGFP and pcDNA3.1-myc. The Ovol2A-IRES-EGFP region was then subcloned into the lentiviral vector pFUGW-IRES-GFP for overexpression experiments. The mutant Ovol2 was generated by PCR using KOD-plus (Toyobo Biotechnology) and then subcloned into the lentiviral vector pFUGW-IRES-Dsred for rescue experiments. The pcDNA3.1-myc-Ovol2 construct was used to transiently express Ovol2 in HEK293T cells to detect the knockdown efficiency of Ovol2 shRNAs. Chick Ovol2 cDNA was amplified by PCR from an Hamburger and Hamilton stage 5 (HH5) chick cDNA library and cloned into pBluescript (for in situ probe preparation) and pCAGGS-IRES-GFP (for chick embryo electroporation). The 992-bp Ovol2 gene promoter flanking upstream of the translation start site (ATG) was amplified by PCR from mouse genomic DNA and was then inserted into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic to generate the pOvoP−992/−1 construct. The pOvoPEn+61/+1378 construct was generated by inserting a 1.3-kb region (+61/+1378) of the Ovol2 genomic DNA between the promoter and the luciferase gene of the pOvoP−992/−1 construct. Sequential deletion of the 1.3-kb enhancer region was performed either by enzymatic digestion or by PCR amplification. The generation of site-mutated luciferase constructs was performed by PCR using KOD-plus (Toyobo Biotechnology) following the manufacturer's instructions. All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The mouse ESC line R1 was maintained on a layer of mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder cells in standard medium. Serum-free neural differentiation of ESCs was performed as described previously (13Zhang K. Li L. Huang C. Shen C. Tan F. Xia C. Liu P. Rossant J. Jing N. Distinct functions of BMP4 during different stages of mouse ES cell neural commitment.Development. 2010; 137: 2095-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For the unbiased differentiation of ESCs, single cells were aggregated in Petri dishes at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml in differentiation medium containing serum. Differentiation day 0 indicates the day on which the ESCs were seeded to differentiate. In some experiments, recombinant human BMP4 protein (R&D Systems) was freshly added at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml or washed by fresh medium twice within the indicated length of time. For the luciferase and ChIP assays, P19C6, a subclone of the mouse EC (embryonic carcinoma) cell line, was cultured as previously described (29Wang C. Xia C. Bian W. Liu L. Lin W. Chen Y.G. Ang S.L. Jing N. Cell aggregation-induced FGF8 elevation is essential for P19 cell neural differentiation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3075-3084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A lentiviral vector pLenti-psilencer expressing shRNA was used for Ovol2 knockdown in ESCs. The control and Ovol2 shRNA sequences are listed in supplemental Table S1. For the overexpression experiments, Ovol2A full-length cDNA was cloned into the lentiviral expression vector pFUGW-IRES-EGFP (30Naldini L. Blömer U. Gage F.H. Trono D. Verma I.M. Efficient transfer, integration, and sustained long-term expression of the transgene in adult rat brains injected with a lentiviral vector.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 11382-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Lentiviral packaging and transfection of ESCs were performed as previously described (31Tiscornia G. Singer O. Verma I.M. Production and purification of lentiviral vectors.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). After lentiviral transfection, GFP-positive cells were sorted using a FACSAria I cell sorter (BD Biosciences) and propagated in ESC culture medium. The cells were then differentiated as embryoid bodies (EBs) and analyzed at the indicated time. Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Pufei). Reverse transcription and qRT-PCR were performed as described previously (13Zhang K. Li L. Huang C. Shen C. Tan F. Xia C. Liu P. Rossant J. Jing N. Distinct functions of BMP4 during different stages of mouse ES cell neural commitment.Development. 2010; 137: 2095-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The copy numbers of the Ovol2 splice forms Ovol2A, Ovol2B, and Ovol2C in ESC cDNA were quantified as previously described (32Ginzinger D.G. Gene quantification using real-time quantitative PCR. An emerging technology hits the mainstream.Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Briefly, standard curves for Ovol2A, -B, and -C were generated using serial dilution of positive control templates and isoform-specific primers, respectively. The copy numbers of each of the three splice forms of Ovol2 expressed in ES cells were then derived from the standard curves. The primers used are listed in supplemental Table S2. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (29Wang C. Xia C. Bian W. Liu L. Lin W. Chen Y.G. Ang S.L. Jing N.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (1:200)-conjugated, Cy3 (1:500)-conjugated, and Cy5 (1:200)-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Normal mouse and rabbit IgGs (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were used as negative controls. The images were taken with Olympus BX50 fluorescence microscopy or Leica confocal microscopy. Luciferase assays in P19 cells were performed as described previously (36Jin Z. Liu L. Bian W. Chen Y. Xu G. Cheng L. Jing N.

Chem. 2009; 284: 8160-8173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, after transfection with Fugene HD (Roche Applied Science), cells were serum-starved in N2B27 (Invitrogen) medium for 18 h, followed by BMP4 (10 ng/ml) treatment for 6 h; the cells were then harvested for the measurement of luciferase activity. All assays were performed in triplicate, and all values were normalized by Renilla LUC (Promega). The ChIP assay was performed following the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and detailed procedures were described previously (36Jin Z. Liu L. Bian W. Chen Y. Xu G. Cheng L.

Immunoprecipitation was performed with 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 (Cell Signaling). Normal rabbit IgG was used as a negative control. Quantitative PCR was used to amplify different regions of the mouse Ovol2 gene, and reaction parameters are available on request. The primers used for the ChIP assay (Ovo-BRE and Ovo-Ctrl) are listed in supplemental Table S3. Fertilized hen's eggs (Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences) were incubated at 38.5 °C to the desired stages (37Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. A series of normal stages in the development of the chick embryo. 1951.Dev. Dyn. 1992; 195: 231-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). For electroporation, 1 μg/μl plasmid was delivered to HH stage 3+/4 chick embryos following the published protocol (38Voiculescu O. Papanayotou C. Stern C.D. Spatially and temporally controlled electroporation of early chick embryos.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Electroporation was performed with a NAPA GENE electroporator at the following settings: 4 V, 5 pulses (50 ms with a 500-ms interval). Whole mount in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry were performed following published protocols (39Streit A. Stern C.D.

Detection of multiple gene products simultaneously by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in whole mounts of avian embryos.Curr. Top. Dev.

The results shown are representative of three independent experiments. The data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The Student's t test was used to compare the effects of all treatments. Differences were considered statistically significant as follows: *, p < 0.05. The mouse Ovol2 gene encodes three isoforms (Ovol2A, -B, and -C) with presumably different transcriptional properties; the different isoforms are generated by the usage of distinct transcriptional start sites and alternative splicing (41Unezaki S. Nishizawa M. Okuda-Ashitaka E. Masu Y. Mukai M. Kobayashi S. Sawamoto K. Okano H. Ito S. Characterization of the isoforms of MOVO zinc finger protein, a mouse homologue of Drosophila Ovo, as transcription factors.Gene. 2004; 336: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ovol2 has been shown to express in mouse ESCs (26Mackay D.R. Hu M. Li B. Rhéaume C. Dai X. The mouse Ovol2 gene is required for cranial neural tube development.Dev. Biol. 2006; 291: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 42Guo G. Huss M. Tong G.Q. Wang C. Li Sun L. Clarke N.D. Robson P. Resolution of cell fate decisions revealed by single-cell gene expression analysis from zygote to blastocyst.Dev. Cell. 2010; 18: 675-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). qRT-PCR analysis showed that Ovol2A was the main isoform expressed in ESCs (Fig. 1A), and we used Ovol2 to represent Ovol2A in the following study. To explore the relationship between Ovol2 expression and ESC neural differentiation, we differentiated ESCs as EBs in serum-free KSR medium for 6 days. In this serum-free EB culture (SFEB) condition, ESCs efficiently converted to Sox+Oct4− neural progenitor cells (NPCs) (13Zhang K. Li L. Huang C. Shen C. Tan F. Xia C. Liu P. Rossant J. Jing N. Distinct functions of BMP4 during different stages of mouse ES cell neural commitment.Development. 2010; 137: 2095-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression level of Ovol2 mRNA gradually declined with the increase of Sox1 mRNA (Fig. 1B), indicating that Ovol2 might be involved in the neural differentiation of ESCs. To study the function of Ovol2 in ESC differentiation, we established ESCs expressing shRNAs targeted against Ovol2 (Ovol2 shRNA ESCs) by lentiviral transduction and found that shRNA-1 could efficiently knock down Ovol2 expression (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). qRT-PCR analysis showed that control shRNA ESCs and Ovol2 shRNA-1 ESCs expressed comparable levels of the pluripotency markers Oct4, Rex1, Nanog, and CRTR1 (supplemental Fig. S1C), suggesting that Ovol2 knockdown has no effect on the pluripotency of ESCs. The control and Ovol2 shRNA-1 ESCs were then differentiated in the SFEB condition for 6 days. We found that Ovol2 shRNA-1 ESCs expressed higher levels of the NPC marker Sox1 at day 4 (Fig. 2A) and the neuronal marker Tuj1 at day 6 (Fig. 2B) compared with the control ESCs, indicating that the knockdown of Ovol2 accelerates ESC neural differentiation. Because the SFEB system efficiently induces almost exclusively neural cell fates, we used an unbiased differentiation system to study the function of Ovol2 in early cell fate decisions (43Schroeder I.S. Rolletschek A. Blyszczuk P. Kania G. Wobus A.M. Differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells to insulin-producing cells.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 495-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The ESCs were differentiated as EBs in serum-containing medium (10% FBS/DMEM) for 8 days. Compared with control ESCs, Ovol2 shRNA-1 ESCs expressed higher levels of the neuroectoderm markers Sox1, Pax6, and Six3 at day 8 (Fig. 2C). Immunostaining analysis further showed that Ovol2 shRNA-1 ESCs differentiated into a higher percentage of Sox+Oct4− NPCs compared with control ESCs (Fig. 2D), confirming that the knockdown of Ovol2 promoted the neural fate decision of ESCs. To test whether Ovol2 also functions in the differentiation of other germ layers, we examined germ layer markers by qRT-PCR and found that Ovol2 knockdown decreased the expression of the mesendoderm markers T and Mixl1 at day 6 and of the mesoderm marker Flk1 and the endoderm markers Gata4, Gata6, and Sox17 at day 8 (Fig. 2E). Consistently, immunostaining showed that the percentages of T+, Flk1+, and Gata6+ cells were reduced in Ovol2 shRNA-1 ESCs (Fig. 2, F–H), suggesting that Ovol2 knockdown inhibits mesendodermal differentiation of ESCs. To confirm the specificity of Ovol2 knockdown, we carried out a rescue experiment using a mutant Ovol2 (mut-Ovo) with silent mutations in the target nucleotide sequence for the shRNA-1 (Fig. 3A). Ovol2 shRNA-1 ESCs were infected with lentivirus encoding mut-Ovo and red fluorescence protein (Dsred) gene for cell sorting. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the ESCs (shRNA-1 + mut-Ovo) expressed a similar level of total Ovol2 as the parental control ESCs (Ctrl + Dsred), suggesting that the mutant Ovol2 escaped the knockdown of shRNA-1 (Fig. 3B). During 6 days of neural differentiation in the SFEB system, expressing mut-Ovo in Ovol2 shRNA-1 ESCs rescued the knockdown phenotype of the up-regulation of the NPC marker Sox1 at day 4 and the neuronal marker Tuj1 at day 6 (Fig. 3C). Consistently, immunostaining showed that the percentage of Tuj1-positive neuronal cells was reduced to the control level by expression of mut-Ovo (Fig. 3D). We also performed the rescue experiment in the unbiased differentiation system. Indeed, the levels of neural markers Sox1 and Pax6 were reduced to the control levels (Fig. 3E), and the levels of mesendodermal marker T, the mesoderm marker Flk1, and the endoderm marker Sox17 were increased to the control levels (Fig. 3F). Immunostaining for T confirmed that mut-Ovo significantly rescued the Ovol2 knockdown-induced defect in mesendodermal differentiation (Fig. 3G). Taken together, these data suggest that Ovol2 knockdown promotes neural conversion and impairs mesendodermal differentiation of ESCs, and this phenotype can be rescued by overexpressing knockdown-resistant Ovol2. To further confirm the function of Ovol2 in cell fate decisions, we overexpressed Ovol2 in ESCs through lentiviral transduction (supplemental Fig. S2A) and found no significant change in the expression of pluripotency markers in Ovol2-overexpressing ESCs (Ovol2-ESCs) (supplemental Fig. S2B). After 8 days of unbiased differentiation in serum-containing medium, Ovol2-ESCs displayed reduced expression of the neural mark"
https://openalex.org/W1999991643,"Overexpression of the NEDD9/HEF1/Cas-L scaffolding protein is frequent, and drives invasion and metastasis in breast, head and neck, colorectal, melanoma, lung and other types of cancer. We have examined the consequences of genetic ablation of Nedd9 in the MMTV-HER2/ERBB2/neu mouse mammary tumor model. Unexpectedly, we found that only a limited effect on metastasis in MMTV-neu;Nedd9(-/-) mice compared with MMTV-neu;Nedd9(+/+) mice, but instead a dramatic reduction in tumor incidence (18 versus 80%), and a significantly increased latency until tumor appearance. Orthotopic reinjection and tail-vein injection of cells arising from tumors, coupled with in vivo analysis, indicated tumors arising in MMTV-neu;Nedd9(-/-) mice had undergone mutational selection that overcame the initial requirement for Nedd9. To better understand the defects in early tumor growth, we compared mammary progenitor cell pools from MMTV-neu;Nedd9(-/-) versus MMTV-neu;Nedd9(+/+) mice. The MMTV-neu;Nedd9(-/-) genotype selectively reduced both the number and colony-forming potential of mammary luminal epithelial progenitor cells, while not affecting basal epithelial progenitors. MMTV-neu;Nedd9(-/-) mammospheres had striking defects in morphology and cell polarity. All of these defects were seen predominantly in the context of the HER2/neu oncogene, and were not associated with randomization of the plane of mitotic division, but rather with depressed expression the cell attachment protein FAK, accompanied by increased sensitivity to small molecule inhibitors of FAK and SRC. Surprisingly, in spite of these significant differences, only minimal changes were observed in the gene expression profile of Nedd9(-/-) mice, indicating critical Nedd9-dependent differences in cell growth properties were mediated via post-transcriptional regulation of cell signaling. Coupled with emerging data indicating a role for NEDD9 in progenitor cell populations during the morphogenesis of other tissues, these results indicate a functional requirement for NEDD9 in the growth of mammary cancer progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2085752326,"The tyrosine kinase c-Abl (or Abl) and the prolyl-isomerase Pin1 cooperatively activate the transcription factor p73 by enhancing recruitment of the acetyltransferase p300. As the transcription factor c-Myc (or Myc) is a known target of Pin1 and p300, we hypothesized that it might be regulated in a similar manner. Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of Pin1 augmented the interaction of Myc with p300 and transcriptional activity. The action of Abl, however, was more complex than predicted. On one hand, Abl indirectly enhanced phosphorylation of Myc on Ser 62 and Thr 58, its association with Pin1 and p300 and its acetylation by p300. These effects of Abl were exerted through phosphorylation of substrate(s) other than Myc itself. On the other hand, Abl interacted with the C-terminal domain of Myc and phosphorylated up to five tyrosine residues in its N-terminus, the principal of which was Y74. Indirect immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical staining suggested that the Y74-phosphorylated form of Myc (Myc-pY74) localized to the cytoplasm and coexisted either with active Abl in a subset of mammary carcinomas or with Bcr-Abl in chronic myeloid leukemia. In all instances, Myc-pY74 constituted a minor fraction of the cellular Myc protein. Thus, our data unravel two potential effects of Abl on Myc: first, Abl signaling can indirectly augment acetylation of Myc by p300, and most likely also its transcriptional activity in the nucleus; second, Abl can directly phosphorylate Myc on tyrosine: the resulting form of Myc appears to be cytoplasmic, and its presence correlates with Abl activation in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1977757877,"Chromosomes are dynamic structures that must be reversibly condensed and unfolded to accommodate mitotic division and chromosome segregation. Histone modifications are involved in the striking chromatin reconfiguration taking place during mitosis. However, the mechanisms that regulate activity and function of histone-modifying factors as cells enter and exit mitosis are poorly understood. Here, we show that the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) is involved in the mitotic turnover of TRRAP (TRansformation/tRanscription domain-Associated Protein), a common component of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, and that the pre-mitotic degradation of TRRAP is mediated by the APC/C ubiquitin ligase activators Cdc20 and Cdh1. Ectopic expression of both Cdh1 and Cdc20 reduced the levels of coexpressed TRRAP protein and induced its ubiquitination. TRRAP overexpression or stabilization induces multiple mitotic defects, including lagging chromosomes, chromosome bridges and multipolar spindles. In addition, lack of sister chromatid cohesion and impaired chromosome condensation were found after TRRAP overexpression or stabilization. By using a truncated form of TRRAP, we show that mitotic delay is associated with a global histone H4 hyperacetylation induced by TRRAP overexpression. These results demonstrate that the chromatin modifier TRRAP is targeted for destruction in a cell cycle-dependent fashion. They also suggest that degradation of TRRAP by the APC/C is necessary for a proper condensation of chromatin and proper chromosome segregation. Chromatin compaction mediated by histone modifiers may represent a fundamental arm for APC/C orchestration of the mitotic machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2077055821,"The small GTPase RhoC is overexpressed in many invasive tumors and is essential for metastasis. Despite its high structural homology to RhoA, RhoC appears to perform functions that are different from those controlled by RhoA. The identity of the signaling components that are differentially regulated by these two GTPases is only beginning to emerge. Here, we show that the MAP3K protein MRK directly binds to the GTP-bound forms of both RhoA and RhoC in vitro. However, siRNA-mediated depletion of MRK in cells phenocopies depletion of RhoC, rather than that of RhoA. MRK depletion, like that of RhoC, inhibits LPA-stimulated cell invasion, while depletion of RhoA increases invasion. We also show that active MRK enhances LPA-stimulated invasion, further supporting a role for MRK in the regulation of invasion. Depletion of either RhoC or MRK causes sustained myosin light chain phosphorylation after LPA stimulation. In addition, activation of MRK causes a reduction in myosin light chain phosphorylation. In contrast, as expected, depletion of RhoA inhibits myosin light chain phosphorylation. We also present evidence that both RhoC and MRK are required for LPA-induced stimulation of the p38 and ERK MAP kinases. In conclusion, we have identified MRK as a novel RhoC effector that controls LPA-stimulated cell invasion at least in part by regulating myosin dynamics, ERK and p38."
https://openalex.org/W2085547721,"Low-grade glial neoplasms (astrocytomas) represent one of the most common brain tumors in the pediatric population. These tumors frequently form in the optic pathway (optic pathway gliomas, OPGs), especially in children with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-inherited tumor predisposition syndrome. To model these tumors in mice, we have previously developed several Nf1 genetically-engineered mouse strains that form optic gliomas. However, there are three distinct macroglial cell populations in the optic nerve (astrocytes, NG2+ (nerve/glial antigen 2) cells and oligodendrocytes). The presence of NG2+ cells in the optic nerve raises the intriguing possibility that these cells could be the tumor-initiating cells, as has been suggested for adult glioma. In this report, we used a combination of complementary in vitro and novel genetically-engineered mouse strains in vivo to determine whether NG2+ cells could give rise to Nf1 optic glioma. First, we show that Nf1 inactivation results in a cell-autonomous increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein+ (GFAP+), but not in NG2+, cell proliferation in vitro. Second, similar to the GFAP-Cre transgenic strain that drives Nf1 optic gliomagenesis, NG2-expressing cells also give rise to all three macroglial lineages in vivo. Third, in contrast to the GFAP-Cre strain, Nf1 gene inactivation in NG2+ cells is not sufficient for optic gliomagenesis in vivo. Collectively, these data demonstrate that NG2+ cells are not the cell of origin for mouse optic glioma, and support a model in which gliomagenesis requires Nf1 loss in specific neuroglial progenitors during embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2067453196,"The hereditary autosomal recessive disease ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is caused by mutation in the DNA damage kinase ATM. ATM's main function is to orchestrate DNA repair, thereby maintaining genomic stability. ATM activity is increased in response to several stimuli, including ionising radiation (IR) and hypotonic stress. DNMT1-associated protein 1 (DMAP1) is a member of the TIP60-p400 histone acetyl transferase (HAT) complex, which acetylates histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16) to affect chromatin relaxation and modulate ATM activation. Here we demonstrate that DMAP1 is required for both modes of ATM activation. Knockdown of DMAP1 impaired IR-induced ATM activation and consequently resulted in radiosensitivity and impaired the G2/M checkpoint. Moreover, DMAP1 was also required for efficient ATM signalling in response to hypotonic stress. Overexpression of DMAP1 increased IR-induced ATM substrate phosphorylation, suggesting that DMAP1 function is rate limiting for ATM signalling. DMAP1 associated with TIP60-dependent HAT activity, and depletion of DMAP1 reduced H4K16 acetylation in response to DNA damage. Treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors rescued IR-induced ATM signalling in Dmap1-depleted cells. These results suggest that DMAP1 is a critical regulator of ATM activity and function."

https://openalex.org/W2094563986,"The pocket proteins retinoblastoma protein (pRb), p107 and p130 are the key targets of oncoproteins expressed by DNA tumor viruses. Some of these viral proteins contain an LXCXE motif that mediates the interaction with the three pocket proteins and the inhibition of the pRb SUMOylation. Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) contains at least two proteins that can regulate pRb function but, so far, a KSHV-encoded protein targeting p107 and p130 has not been identified. Here, we show that the KSHV latent protein LANA2 binds to pRb, p107 and p130. LANA2 contains an LXCXE motif that is required for bypassing pRb-mediated cell-cycle arrest and for inhibiting pRb SUMOylation. Finally, we demonstrate that, in addition to pRb, both p107 and p130 can be SUMOylated, and this modification is also inhibited by LANA2 in an LXCXE-dependent manner. These results demonstrate, for the first time, the SUMOylation of p107 or p130 and, so far, they represent the first example of a KSHV protein able to interact with the three pocket proteins and to inhibit their conjugation to SUMO."
https://openalex.org/W2000271670,"Uveal melanoma (UM) is unique among cancers in displaying reduced endogenous levels of sister chromatid exchange (SCE). Here we demonstrate that FANCD2 expression is reduced in UM and that ectopic expression of FANCD2 increased SCE. Similarly, FANCD2-deficient fibroblasts (PD20) derived from Fanconi anaemia patients displayed reduced spontaneous SCE formation relative to their FANCD2-complemented counterparts, suggesting that this observation is not specific to UM. In addition, spontaneous RAD51 foci were reduced in UM and PD20 cells compared with FANCD2-proficient cells. This is consistent with a model where spontaneous SCEs are the end product of endogenous recombination events and implicates FANCD2 in the promotion of recombination-mediated repair of endogenous DNA damage and in SCE formation during normal DNA replication. In both UM and PD20 cells, low SCE was reversed by inhibiting DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit). Finally, we demonstrate that both PD20 and UM are sensitive to acetaldehyde, supporting a role for FANCD2 in repair of lesions induced by such endogenous metabolites. Together, these data suggest FANCD2 may promote spontaneous SCE by influencing which double-strand break repair pathway predominates during normal S-phase progression."
https://openalex.org/W2023862162,"Cyclin D1 deregulation is implicated in the genesis of multiple human cancers. Importantly, nuclear cyclin D1 retention during S-phase promotes DNA re-replication and subsequent genomic instability, providing a direct correlation between aberrant cyclin D1/CDK4 activity, transcriptional regulation and double strand DNA break (DSB) induction. Together, these molecular events catalyze the genomic instability necessary for neoplastic transformation. Given that replication-associated DNA damage is central to cyclin D1-driven neoplasia, inactivation of critical checkpoint mediators should augment cyclin D1-dependent tumorigenesis in vivo. To interrogate potential synergy between constitutively nuclear cyclin D1 expression and impaired DSB-induced checkpoint integrity, Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM)-deficient mice harboring the Eμ-D1T286A transgene were generated and evaluated for tumor onset. Eμ-D1T286A/ATM−/− mice exhibit dramatically accelerated incidence of both B- and T-cell lymphomas relative to Eμ-D1T286A or ATM−/− control cohorts. Lymphomas exhibit clonal chromosomal alterations distinct from ATM−/− mice, which typically acquire translocations involving the Tcrα/δ locus during V(D)J recombination, and instead harbor alterations at the c-Myc locus. Collectively, these findings reveal an intricate relationship wherein nuclear cyclin D1/CDK4 drives genomic instability in the absence of ATM function and clonal selection of cells harboring alterations within the murine c-Myc locus, ultimately facilitating transformation and tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W2017737191,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha (PTPα/PTPRA) was shown previously to be overexpressed in human primary breast cancers, and to suppress apoptosis in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells in vitro. However, it is not known whether PTPα is important for mammary tumor initiation, maintenance and/or progression. We have used a combination of three-dimensional cultures, a transgenic mouse model of breast cancer lacking PTPα as well as xenografts of human breast cancer cell lines to address these questions. We found that PTPα knockdown after overt tumor development reduced the growth of HER2-positive human breast cancer cell lines, and that this effect was accompanied by a reduction in AKT phosphorylation. However, PTPα knockdown did not affect invasiveness of HER2-positive human breast cancer cells grown in three-dimensional cultures. Moreover, in MMTV-NeuNT/PTPα−/− mice, PTPα ablation did not affect NeuNT-evoked tumor onset or metastasis but decreased the number of tumors per mouse. Thus, we demonstrate that PTPα contributes to both HER2/Neu-mediated mammary tumor initiation and maintenance. Our results suggest that inhibition of PTPα can have a beneficial effect on HER2-positive breast cancers, but that inhibition of additional targets is needed to block breast tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2138646216,"ARF is a multifunctional tumor suppressor that acts as both a sensor of oncogenic stimuli and as a key regulator of ribosome biogenesis. Recently, our group established the DEAD-box RNA helicase and microRNA (miRNA) microprocessor accessory subunit, DDX5, as a critical target of basal ARF function. To identify other molecular targets of ARF, we focused on known interacting proteins of DDX5 in the microprocessor complex. Drosha, the catalytic core of the microprocessor complex, has a critical role in the maturation of specific non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). Here, we report that chronic or acute loss of Arf enhanced Drosha protein expression. This induction did not involve Drosha mRNA transcription or protein stability but rather relied on the increased translation of existing Drosha mRNAs. Enhanced Drosha expression did not alter global miRNA production but rather modified expression of a subset of miRNAs in the absence of Arf. Elevated Drosha protein levels were required to maintain the increased rRNA synthesis and cellular proliferation observed in the absence of Arf. Arf-deficient cells transformed by oncogenic RasV12 were dependent on increased Drosha expression as Drosha knockdown was sufficient to inhibit Ras-dependent cellular transformation. Thus, we propose that ARF regulates Drosha mRNA translation to prevent aberrant cell proliferation and Ras-dependent transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1970161589,"Src is the founding member of a diverse family of intracellular tyrosine kinases, and Src has a key role in promoting cancer growth, in part, through its association with receptor tyrosine kinases. However, some Src-related proteins have widely divergent physiological roles, and these proteins include the Rak/Frk tyrosine kinase (Frk stands for Fyn-related kinase), which inhibits cancer cell growth and suppresses tumorigenesis. Rak/Frk phosphorylates and stabilizes the Pten tumor suppressor, protecting it from degradation, and Rak/Frk associates with the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor. However, the role of Rak/Frk in receptor-mediated signaling is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Rak/Frk associates with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), increasing in activity and EGFR binding after EGF stimulation, when it decreases the pool of EGFR present at the plasma membrane. EGFR–Rak binding is direct, requires the SH2 and SH3 domains of Rak/Frk for efficient complex formation and is not dependent on the Grb2 adaptor protein. EGFR mutations are associated with increased EGFR activity and tumorigenicity, and we found that Rak/Frk associates preferentially with an EGFR exon 19 mutant, EGFRΔ747–749/A750P, compared with wild-type EGFR. Furthermore, Rak/Frk inhibited mutant EGFR phosphorylation at an activating site and dramatically decreased the levels of EGFRΔ747–749/A750P from the plasma membrane. Taken together, the results suggest that Rak/Frk inhibits EGFR signaling in cancer cells and has elevated activity against EGFR exon 19 mutants."

https://openalex.org/W2039752319,"Membrane proton transporters contribute to pH homeostasis but have also been shown to transmit information between cells in close proximity through regulated proton secretion. For example, the nematode intestinal Na+/H+ exchanger NHX-7 causes adjacent muscle cells to contract by transiently acidifying the extracellular space between the intestine and muscle. NHX-7 operates during a Ca2+-dependent rhythmic behavior and contains several conserved motifs for regulation by Ca2+ input, including motifs for calmodulin and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding, protein kinase C- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II phosphorylation, and a binding site for calcineurin homologous protein. Here, we tested the idea that Ca2+ input differentiates proton signaling from pH housekeeping activity. Each of these motifs was mutated, and their contribution to NHX-7 function was assessed. These functions included pH recovery from acidification in cells in culture expressing recombinant NHX-7, extracellular acidification measured during behavior in live moving worms, and muscle contraction strength as a result of this acidification. Our data suggest that multiple levels of Ca2+ input regulate NHX-7, whose transport capacity normally exceeds the minimum necessary to cause muscle contraction. Furthermore, extracellular acidification limits NHX-7 proton transport through feedback inhibition, likely to prevent metabolic acidosis from occurring.

Because pH regulation plays a ubiquitous role in cell physiology and is crucial to an organism's health, it is not surprising that a wide variety of acid-base transporters exist (1.Casey J.R.

However, recent evidence suggests that protons themselves may have an additional role in signaling between cells. Several types of mammalian proton receptors have been identified, including a class of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPR4, OGR1, G2A, and TDAG8), adhesion the kinase Pyk2, and cation channels of the Na+ channel/degenerin superfamily (ASIC1/DRASIC) (5.Ludwig M.G.

Therefore, local regulation of proton availability may have important physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences through signal transmission processes. Membrane transporters that regulate pH homeostasis may also have a role in directing localized transient proton signals as part of an intercellular communication cascade. If so, it will be important to determine what particular features of such proteins distinguish their basal activity (which contributes to maintaining pH) from their stimulated acute activity during cell signaling. Caenorhabditis elegans is a genetic model organism in which protons have been recently shown to be actively secreted as an intercellular signaling molecule during a rhythmic behavior (17.Beg A.A.

The first set is a contraction of the posterior body wall muscles (pBoc). This is closely followed by a contraction of the anterior body wall muscles and then expulsion of the luminal contents. Genetic analyses have shown that intestinal cell-autonomous oscillatory Ca2+ signaling is central to the defecation pacemaker (22.Dal Santo P. Logan M.A. Chisholm A.D. Jorgensen E.M.

Proton secretion was found to be both necessary and sufficient to trigger pBoc. Mechanistically, extracellular acidification resulting from NHX-7 activity was found to provide proton substrates that bound directly to and activated a ligand-gated cation channel, PBO-5/6 (pH50 ∼6.8), expressed on the muscle membrane. Activation of PBO-5/6 resulted in muscle depolarization and pBoc (17.Beg A.A. Ernstrom G.G. Nix P. Davis M.W. Jorgensen E.M.

The NHX family of Na+-H+ exchangers in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29036-29044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although some of these isoforms are ubiquitously expressed (NHE1 (42.Noël J. Pouysségur J. Hormonal regulation, pharmacology, and membrane sorting of vertebrate Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms.Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and NHX-4 (41.Nehrke K. Melvin J.E. The NHX family of Na+-H+ exchangers in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29036-29044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)) in a “housekeeping” manner, others demonstrate a high degree of cell-specific expression, suggesting potentially unique modes of regulation and function. The basal activity of these NHEs can be modulated via a cytoplasmic allosteric proton-binding site that enhances activity upon intracellular acidification (low pHi) (43.Aronson P.S. Nee J. Suhm M.A. Modifier role of internal H+ in activating the Na+-H+ exchanger in renal microvillus membrane vesicles.Nature. 1982; 299: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) as well as by various protein interactions with regulatory motifs located in the C-terminal tail (26.Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. Structural and functional analysis of the Na+/H+ exchanger.Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This intracellular tail has also been shown to be the site of regulation by protein kinases, and these regulatory events can be a more powerful determinant of activity than the overall expression level of a given transporter (44.Imahashi K. Mraiche F. Steenbergen C. Murphy E. Fliegel L. Overexpression of the Na+/H+ exchanger and ischemia-reperfusion injury in the myocardium.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H2237-H2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One ubiquitous and well studied regulatory mechanism is that of second messenger Ca2+ signaling. NHE1 and NHE3 both respond to changes in Ca2+ through a number of mechanisms, including phosphorylation by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII) and interactions with Ca2+-binding proteins such as calmodulin (CaM), calcineurin homologous protein (CHP), and tescalin (reviewed in Refs. 26.Slepkov E.R. Rainey J.K. Sykes B.D. Fliegel L. Structural and functional analysis of the Na+/H+ exchanger.Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and 45.He P. Yun C.C. Mechanisms of the regulation of the intestinal Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3.J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2010; 2010238080Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+ has the ability to both positively and negatively regulate Na+/H+ exchange and can do so in an isoform- and cell-specific manner. Here, we present the results of a structure-function analysis focused on deciphering if and how Ca2+ signaling regulates NHX-7. We used dynamic fluorescent pH imaging to measure NHX-7 activity both in cells in culture and in live moving worms, where we could assess behavioral output. We hereby describe a role for CaM- and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-binding motifs in activation of the exchanger. Although we were further able to demonstrate that CaM interacts directly with NHX-7, we also found that it impacts oscillatory Ca2+ signaling upstream of NHX-7. Finally, a potential role for CaMKII phosphorylation in limiting the extent of proton transport may relate to the observation that extracellular acidification provides feedback inhibition and likely prevents metabolic acidosis from occurring. Standard nematode culture techniques were used (46.Brenner S. The genetics of Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains containing pbo-4(ok583)X, pbo-5(n2303)V, and pha-1(e2123ts)III alleles were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (University of Minnesota) and the C. elegans Gene Knockout Consortium. Other strains used in this work are described in detail under supplemental Experimental Procedures.” Gene expression levels were assayed in first-strand cDNA samples using iQTM SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and standard protocols for real-time PCR and normalized to both pmp-3 and cdc-42 using the following primer pairs: nhx-7, 5′-CAGTACACTTTGCGAGTCGCTTAT-3′ and 5′-AGTTTGATCGTAGAACCCTGGATG-3′; pmp-3, 5′-GTTCCCGTGTTCATCACTCAT-3′ and 5′-ACACCGTCGAGAAGCTGTAGA-3′; and cdc-42, 5′-CTGCTGGACAGGAAGATTACG-3′ and 5′-CTCGGACATTCTCGAATGAAG-3′. Plasmid constructs were created by conventional restriction site-mediated cloning methods. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce point mutants, and inverse PCR was used to create deletions. Specific details as to the construction of the plasmids can be found under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” A plasmid containing the extracellular pH sensor was a kind gift of Dr. L. Pablo Cid (Centro de Estudios Científicos, Valdivia, Chile) and has been described previously (47.Urra J. Sandoval M. Cornejo I. Barros L.F. Sepúlveda F.V. Cid L.P. A genetically encoded ratiometric sensor to measure extracellular pH in microdomains bounded by basolateral membranes of epithelial cells.Pflugers Arch. 2008; 457: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified via DNA sequencing. pBoc strength and duration were determined post hoc from transmitted light videos by measuring the perimeter of late L4 worms in their maximally relaxed and contracted states. Worms in which the reference points were obscured by movement, in either assay, were excluded from analysis. Transgenic nematodes were imaged live and unrestrained as described previously (18.Pfeiffer J. Johnson D. Nehrke K. Oscillatory transepithelial H+ flux regulates a rhythmic behavior in C. elegans.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 297-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Imaging was performed with a 10× Nikon Plan Apo objective. Illumination was provided by a Polychrome IV monochromator (TILL Photonics) rigged to a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S inverted microscope equipped with a high-speed charge-coupled device camera (Cooke). TILLvisION software was used for analysis, data were compiled in Microsoft Excel, and graphs were generated using Origin. AP-1 cells were cultured as described (48.Johnson D. Allman E. Nehrke K. Regulation of acid-base transporters by reactive oxygen species following mitochondrial fragmentation.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2012; 302: C1045-C1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and transfected using Lipofectamine LTX reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were made quiescent by placing them in low-serum medium for at least 1 h. The cells were then loaded with the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2′,7′-bi-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes) and superfused with physiologic saline on a Nikon/TILL Photonics fluorescent imaging rig (described above), and incubation with high K+/nigericin at varying pH values was used to calibrate the sensor (49.Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Intracellular pH measurements in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells utilizing spectroscopic probes generated in situ.Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). To measure Na+/H+ exchange activity, an ammonium prepulse was employed as described (48.Johnson D. Allman E. Nehrke K. Regulation of acid-base transporters by reactive oxygen species following mitochondrial fragmentation.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2012; 302: C1045-C1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Confocal micrographs were obtained on an Olympus IX81 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope. The same parameters were used for all of the mutants when imaging across worm strains or across transfections. Recombinant NHX-7 was detected using a mouse anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (1:2000; Invitrogen) and an Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000; Molecular Probes) using standard techniques. In vitro transcription/translation (TnT; Promega) of linearized template DNA was used to label fusion proteins with [35S]methionine. Proteins associating with biotinylated bovine CaM (5 μm; Calbiochem) were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose. Equivalent fractions of the starting and bound material were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized using autoradiography. Nematodes were grown on bacteria expressing double-stranded RNA as described (50.Nehrke K. A reduction in intestinal cell pHi due to loss of the Caenorhabditis elegans Na+/H+ exchanger NHX-2 increases life span.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44657-44666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Execution of the DMP was visualized under a dissecting microscope, and timing data were collected using Etho software, a keystroke recorder (51.Iwasaki K. Liu D.W. Thomas J.H. Genes that control a temperature-compensated ultradian clock in Caenorhabditis elegans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 10317-10321Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To analyze NHX-7 exchange activity, a cDNA was expressed in AP-1 cells, a mammalian cell line that lacks endogenous Na+/H+ exchanger activity (31.Rotin D. Grinstein S. Impaired cell volume regulation in Na+-H+ exchange-deficient mutants.Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1158-C1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody staining of a V5 epitope tag built into the C terminus of NHX-7 confirmed its expression at the plasma membrane (see Fig. 3F). As is commonly observed with overexpression, some of the protein was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as well. To test whether or not the exchanger was active, an ammonium prepulse was used to acidify the cells (52.Boron W.F. De Weer P.
