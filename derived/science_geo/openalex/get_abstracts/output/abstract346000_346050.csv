https://openalex.org/W2043175787,"Recent theory predicted that the quantum spin Hall effect, a fundamentally new quantum state of matter that exists at zero external magnetic field, may be realized in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We fabricated such sample structures with low density and high mobility in which we could tune, through an external gate voltage, the carrier conduction from n-type to p-type, passing through an insulating regime. For thin quantum wells with well width d < 6.3 nanometers, the insulating regime showed the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells (d > 6.3 nanometers), the nominally insulating regime showed a plateau of residual conductance close to 2e(2)/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant. The residual conductance was independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance was destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, d = 6.3 nanometers, was also independently determined from the magnetic field-induced insulator-to-metal transition. These observations provide experimental evidence of the quantum spin Hall effect."

By exploiting the optical properties of metamaterials, these nanoparticles may play the role of “lumped” nanocircuit elements such as nanoinductors, nanocapacitors, and nanoresistors, analogous to microelectronics. I show that this concept of metamaterial-inspired nanoelectronics (“metactronics”) can bring the tools and mathematical machinery of the circuit theory into optics, may link the fields of optics, electronics, plasmonics, and metamaterials, and may provide road maps to future innovations in nanoscale optical devices, components, and more intricate nanoscale metamaterials."

Using a stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomic screening we show that the basal transcription factor TFIID directly binds to the H3K4me3 mark via the plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of TAF3. Selective loss of H3K4me3 reduces transcription from and TFIID binding to a subset of promoters in vivo. Equilibrium binding assays and competition experiments show that the TAF3 PHD finger is highly selective for H3K4me3. In transient assays, TAF3 can act as a transcriptional coactivator in a PHD finger-dependent manner. Interestingly, asymmetric dimethylation of H3R2 selectively inhibits TFIID binding to H3K4me3, whereas acetylation of H3K9 and H3K14 potentiates TFIID interaction. Our experiments reveal crosstalk between histone modifications and the transcription factor TFIID. This has important implications for regulation of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription in higher eukaryotes.

The organization and functional state of chromatin is closely linked to posttranslational modifications of histones (Jenuwein and Allis, 2001Jenuwein T. Allis C.D.

Modified histones are thought to serve as binding scaffolds for regulatory proteins that translate these modifications into physiological responses. Genome-wide localization studies show that trimethylation of histone H3K4 (H3K4me3) marks active promoters in human cells in a pattern very similar to H3K9 and K14 acetylation (Bernstein et al., 2005Bernstein B.E.

These interactors bind to methylated H3K4 via different domains, such as WD-40, Tudor, MBT, and the plant homeodomain (PHD) (Kim et al., 2006Kim J. Daniel J. Espejo A. Lake A. Krishna M. Xia L.

The genome-wide distributions of H3K4me3 and H3K9,14Ac are highly similar to that of the human TAF1 protein (Bernstein et al., 2005Bernstein B.E. Kamal M. Lindblad-Toh K. Bekiranov S. Bailey D.K.

Genet. 2007; 39: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar), which represents the largest subunit of TFIID. Promoter recruitment of this basal transcription factor is stimulated by gene-specific transcription factors and transcriptional cofactors. Besides TAF1, TFIID harbors TATA-binding protein (TBP) in association with 12–13 additional TBP-associated factors (Tora, 2002Tora L. A unified nomenclature for TATA box binding protein (TBP)-associated factors (TAFs) involved in RNA polymerase II transcription.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In addition to histone-fold motifs, which are important for TAF-TAF interactions within TFIID (Leurent et al., 2004Leurent C. Sanders S.L. Demeny M.A. Garbett K.A. Ruhlmann C. Weil P.A. Tora L. Schultz P. Mapping key functional sites within yeast TFIID.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and references therein), several other conserved motifs (HMG, NHR1, DUF1546, LisH, WD-40, PHD) have been identified. The relevance of these domains, if any, for promoter activation is not clear yet. In contrast, the double bromodomain of metazoan TAF1 has been shown to preferentially bind diacetylated histone H4 peptides and with a lower affinity also binds monoacetylated peptides (Jacobson et al., 2000Jacobson R.H. Ladurner A.G. King D.S. Tjian R. Structure and function of a human TAFII250 double bromodomain module.Science. 2000; 288: 1422-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). To summarize, while it is clear that histone acetylation and methylation cooperate in the activation of promoters, the crosstalk between these modifications at the level of the basal transcription machinery has not been explored fully. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has become a powerful tool in biology and for identification of histone modifications, in particular (Aebersold and Mann, 2003Aebersold R. Mann M. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics.Nature. 2003; 422: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (5280) Google Scholar, Taverna et al., 2007Taverna S.D. Ueberheide B.M. Liu Y. Tackett A.J. Diaz R.L.

USA. 2007; 104: 2086-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We have previously used quantitative proteomics to dissect regulatory pathways (Mann, 2006Mann M.

Mann M. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics turns quantitative.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Here we employ a screen to identify peptide-protein interactions by stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (Schulze and Mann, 2004Schulze W.X. Mann M. A novel proteomic screen for Peptide-protein interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10756-10764Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In addition to several known interaction partners for H3K4me3, we unexpectedly identified subunits of the basal transcription factor TFIID as specific binders. We show that H3K4me3 binding is mediated by the PHD finger of the TAF3 subunit and that the methylation mark is essential for this PHD to bind native nucleosomes in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of TAF3 can enhance transcription stimulation by the Ash2L subunit of Set1/MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia) histone methyltransferases in a PHD-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that asymmetric dimethylation of H3R2 can selectively inhibit, and that acetylation of H3K9 and H3K14 potentiates, TFIID interaction with the K4-methylated H3 tail. These experiments reveal a direct connection between the basal transcription apparatus and transcriptionally active chromatin and expand our view of how histone modifications support transcriptional activation by TFIID. In order to identify novel proteins interacting with H3K4me3, we set up a peptide pull-down approach making use of the SILAC technology. In SILAC, one or more amino acids are replaced with their stable isotope-labeled counterpart, thus generating “light”- and “heavy”-labeled proteins, which are distinguishable and quantifiable by MS. The experimental approach for identification of interaction partners of modified histones is depicted in Figure 1A. Nuclear extracts derived from human HeLaS3 cells grown in light or heavy medium are incubated with immobilized histone peptides in the nonmethylated and methylated form, respectively. After incubation and extensive washing, beads from both pull-downs are pooled, boiled in loading buffer, and run on an SDS-PAGE gel. Following in-gel trypsin digestion and peptide extraction, the peptide mixtures were analyzed by high resolution MS on a linear ion trap-orbitrap instrument. The vast majority of proteins (>99%) bound equally well to the methylated and nonmethylated peptide and appeared in the mass spectra with equal intensity in the light and heavy form. Proteins interacting in a methylation-dependent manner are present with a higher intensity in the heavy form. This quantitative filter therefore distinguishes specific binders. When performing this screen for H3K4me3, we identified several known interactors with a significant SILAC ratio. They included BPTF (Figure 1B) and CHD1 (Figure 1C), which have been reported to bind methylated H3K4 via a PHD finger and a double chromodomain, respectively (Wysocka et al., 2006Wysocka J. Swigut T. Xiao H. Milne T.A. Kwon S.Y. Landry J. Kauer M. Tackett A.J. Chait B.T. Badenhorst P. et al.A PHD finger of NURF couples histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation with chromatin remodelling.Nature. 2006; 442: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2006Li H. Ilin S. Wang W. Duncan E.M. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Molecular basis for site-specific read-out of histone H3K4me3 by the BPTF PHD finger of NURF.Nature. 2006; 442: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A number of other novel interactors were identified, which included several PHD finger-containing proteins (see Table S2). Surprisingly, we also identified all TAF subunits of TFIID with highly significant ratios (∼30:1), indicating that the TFIID complex specifically binds to trimethylated H3K4 (Figures 1D, 1F, S1–S5, and Table S1). The TATA-binding protein (TBP) showed a SILAC ratio of 4, substantially lower than the ratios of the TFIID TAFs. While still significant, this lower ratio can be explained by the presence of TBP complexes lacking TFIID TAFs, which would bind nonspecifically to bait and control. This is also exemplified by the TAFI63 (or TAF1B) subunit of SL1 (ratio 0.98, Figure 1F). We verified the preferential interaction between TFIID and H3K4me3 by immunoblotting (Figure 1E). To investigate the functional consequences of this interaction we performed RNAi experiments against WDR5, which is known to preferentially reduce global levels of the H3K4me3 marks but not of H3K4 me2 and H3K4me1 (Dou et al., 2006Dou Y.

Figure 2A shows that WDR5 siRNA treatment of U2OS cells indeed resulted in a pronounced reduction of H3K4me3. We examined the mRNA levels of a number of genes to identify promoters sensitive to H3K4me3 loss. As indicated by Figure 2B, WDR5 siRNA treatment reduced the mRNA levels of the HMG-CoA reductase, RPL34, RPS10, and RPL31 genes by about 2-fold. In contrast, fibronectin and the β-actin reference mRNAs were not affected. Analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) samples by quantitative PCR showed that the WDR5 siRNA reduced TBP association to the HMG-CoA reductase but not to the fibronectin core promoter (Figure 2C). As expected, H3K4me3 modification was reduced on both promoters. An extensive ChIP analysis of TBP and TAF1 binding was performed for the RPL34, RPL31, and RPS10 genes by scanning their 5′ regions using different PCR primer pairs (Figures 2D, 2E and S6). WDR5 siRNA treatment also reduced TBP and TAF1 association to these promoters. TBP and TAF1 ChIP signals were also detected more downstream overlapping with the peak of H3K4me3. This corresponds well with recently published ChIP-chip results for these factors (Bernstein et al., 2005Bernstein B.E. Kamal M. Lindblad-Toh K. Bekiranov S. Bailey D.K. Huebert D.J. McMahon S.

Genet. 2007; 39: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the entire TFIID complex but not other TBP-containing complexes specifically associates with H3K4me3 peptides in vitro and that the H3K4me3 mark is important for retention of TFIID and the transcriptional activity of a subset of promoters in vivo. Several papers described interactions between PHD fingers containing proteins (including BPTF) and methylated H3K4 or H3K36 peptides (Li et al., 2006Li H. Ilin S. Wang W. Duncan E.M. Wysocka J.

Interestingly, the metazoan TAF3 subunit of TFIID contains a PHD finger at its extreme C terminus (Gangloff et al., 2001Gangloff Y.G. Pointud J.C. Thuault S. Carre L. Romier C. Muratoglu S. Brand M. Tora L. Couderc J.L. Davidson I. The TFIID components human TAF(II)140 and Drosophila BIP2 (TAF(II)155) are novel metazoan homologues of yeast TAF(II)47 containing a histone fold and a PHD finger.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5109-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Pointud et al., 2001Pointud J.C. Larsson J. Dastugue B. Couderc J.L. The BTB/POZ domain of the regulatory proteins Bric a brac 1 (BAB1) and Bric a brac 2 (BAB2) interacts with the novel Drosophila TAF(II) factor BIP2/dTAF(II)155.Dev. Biol. 2001; 237: 368-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Alignment of the PHD fingers of TAF3 and ING2 (Figure 3A) revealed conservation of residues involved in H3K4me3 interaction (Ruthenburg et al., 2007Ruthenburg A.J. Allis C.D. Wysocka J. Methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3: intricacy of writing and reading a single epigenetic mark.Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 15-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). This suggests that the PHD finger of TAF3 could be critical for the interaction between TFIID and methylated H3K4. To test this hypothesis we generated HeLa cell lines expressing tagged versions of full-length mouse TAF3 or TAF3ΔC80 lacking the C-terminal PHD finger (see Figure S7). Nuclear extracts derived from these cell lines were tested for binding to H3 peptides. Whereas the tagged full-length mTAF3 protein bound specifically to the H3K4me3 peptide (Figure 3B, compare lane 1 and 2), no binding of the tagged mTAF3ΔC80 protein could be observed (lane 3 and 4). The TAF7 subunit of TFIID was also retained by the H3K4me3 peptide, but to a lesser extent in the TAF3ΔC80 extracts (compare lanes 2 and 4). This may be explained by a dominant-negative effect of the TAF3ΔC80 protein, which replaces part of the endogenous TAF3 in the pool of cellular TFIID. Further analysis indicated that the tagged TAF3 proteins are incorporated into TFIID complexes (Figure S7). Thus, TFIID complexes harboring the truncated TAF3ΔC80 subunit are defective for H3K4me3 binding. To further investigate this we assessed the ability of a GST fusion of the isolated TAF3-PHD finger to bind methylated histone peptides. As shown in Figure 3C, the PHD finger bound very efficiently to methylated H3K4, with a clear preference for H3K4me3, whereas no binding to methylated H3K9 or H3K36 was observed. Based on the sequence alignment we mutated selected residues of the TAF3-PHD finger expected to be involved in H3K4me3 binding (Figure 3A). GST-TAF3 PHD fusions carrying the M882A, D886A, and D890A/W891A mutations were unable to bind H3K4me3 (Figure 3D). The control A901V mutation did not affect binding efficiency. Previous analysis showed that mutation of equivalent residues in the PHDs of mouse ING2 or human BPTF reduced H3K4me3 binding 20- to 500-fold (Li et al., 2006Li H. Ilin S. Wang W. Duncan E.M. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Molecular basis for site-specific read-out of histone H3K4me3 by the BPTF PHD finger of NURF.Nature. 2006; 442: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, Pena et al., 2006Pena P.V. Davrazou F. Shi X. Walter K.L. Verkhusha V.V. Gozani O. Zhao R. Kutateladze T.G. Molecular mechanism of histone H3K4me3 recognition by plant homeodomain of ING2.Nature. 2006; 442: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Our mutational analysis underscores the specificity of the interaction and verifies the importance of several residues conserved between PHD fingers (Ruthenburg et al., 2007Ruthenburg A.J. Allis C.D. Wysocka J. Methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3: intricacy of writing and reading a single epigenetic mark.Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 15-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). To directly compare the affinities between the PHD fingers of TAF3 and ING2 for H3K4me3, we performed a competition experiment under conditions of PHD finger excess over peptide. As shown in Figure 3E, the ING2 and TAF3-PHD finger display similar binding affinities for H3K4me2, whereas the TAF3 PHD clearly has a much higher affinity for H3K4me3 compared to the ING2 PHD. This indicates that the TAF3-PHD finger discriminates strongly between the H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 marks. To accurately determine the affinities for modified H3 peptides we performed equilibrium binding assays with the TAF3-PHD finger using tryptophan fluorescence. Using the same methodology, the dissociation constant of the ING2 PHD for H3K4me3 was determined to be 1.5 μM (Pena et al., 2006Pena P.V. Davrazou F. Shi X. Walter K.L. Verkhusha V.V. Gozani O. Zhao R. Kutateladze T.G. Molecular mechanism of histone H3K4me3 recognition by plant homeodomain of ING2.Nature. 2006; 442: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In our experiments and as expected from Figure 3E, binding of the TAF3 PHD to the H3K4me3 peptide was much stronger with a dissociation constant of 0.16 μM (Figure 3F). The higher affinity of the TAF3 PHD compared to ING2 PHD most likely relates to subtle differences in the geometry of the aromatic cage involved in binding of the trimethyl lysine (I869 and W891 in mTAF3 versus Y215 and W238 in mING2). Structural analysis of the PHD finger of TAF3 will provide further insight into this. Taken together, H3 peptide-binding assays identified the PHD finger of TAF3 as necessary and sufficient for recognition of the H3K4me3 mark. The experiments described so far indicate that the TFIID complex binds via the PHD of TAF3 with a high selectivity to histone H3K4me3 peptides. To extend these observations we isolated nucleosomes from HeLa cells and various yeast strains (Figure 4A and data not shown) to investigate whether the TAF3 PHD finger is able to recognize the H3K4me3 mark in native chromatin. As shown in Figures 4B and 4C, immunoblotting with modification-specific antibodies revealed that the bound nucleosomes were enriched for H3K4me3 and contained only low levels of H3K4me2 or H3K4me1. DNA analysis of bound yeast nucleosomes indicated retention of mono-, di-, and trinucleosomes (Figure 4C). In agreement with the peptide pull-down, the two PHD mutants D886A and D890A/W891A were unable to bind yeast nucleosomes, indicating the specificity of binding. To address the importance of the H3K4 trimethylation mark for the binding, we isolated nucleosomes from yeast strains carrying deletions in genes responsible for different histone methylation marks (Figure 4D). The SET1, SET2, and DOT1 genes encode histone methyltransferase (HMT) enzymes for H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79, respectively (Martin and Zhang, 2005Martin C. Zhang Y. The diverse functions of histone lysine methylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). SPP1 encodes a subunit of the Set1p/COMPASS HMT complex and has been shown to be important for efficient H3K4 trimethylation, but not di- or monomethylation of H3K4 (Dehe et al., 2006Dehe P.M. Dichtl B. Schaft D. Roguev A. Pamblanco M. Lebrun R. Rodriguez-Gil A. Mkandawire M. Landsberg K.

Cell. 2005; 19: 849-856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). As predicted the TAF3 PHD finger binds nucleosomes from set2Δ and dot1Δ strains indicating that neither H3K36 nor H3K79 methylation is required for binding to nucleosomes (Figure 4E). However, in the set1Δ and spp1Δ strains, in which H3K4 (tri-)methylation is abolished, nucleosome binding was lost. These results indicate that the TAF3 PHD finger binds specifically to native H3K4me3-marked nucleosomes. The structure of the WDR5 protein bound to an N-terminal peptide of histone H3 indicated that methylation of H3R2 negatively affected WDR5 binding (for review, see Sims and Reinberg, 2006Sims 3rd, R.J. Reinberg D. Histone H3 Lys 4 methylation: caught in a bind?.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2779-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in yeast, asymmetric dimethylation of H3R2 inhibits the binding of the PHD finger protein SPP1 to methylated H3K4 (A. Kirmizis and T. Kouzarides, personal communication). To investigate a potential inhibitory effect of H3R2 methylation on the H3K4me3 binding of PHD finger proteins we compared several differentially methylated histone H3 peptides. This revealed that asymmetric dimethylation of H3R2 drastically reduces the binding of the TAF3 PHD to H3K4me3, whereas this effect was not observed for the ING2 or BPTF PHD (Figure 5A). This was confirmed in a competition experiment (Figure 5B), which revealed that the ING2 and TAF3-PHD finger have a similar affinity for the doubly methylated peptide (R2me2a/K4me3). In agreement with the GST-PHD pull-downs, H3R2me2a results in a 25-fold lower binding constant of the H3K4me3 modified peptide, whereas H3R2me2s and H3R2me1 display little effect (Figure 3F). Together, these analyses indicate that asymmetric dimethylation of H3R2 counters the high affinity of the PHD finger of TAF3 but not of ING2 and BPTF for the H3K4me3 mark. To further investigate the effect of asymmetric dimethylation of H3R2 on the binding of the TFIID complex to trimethylated H3K4, we extended our quantitative proteomics approach to simultaneously assay three different histone modification marks (H3 unmodified, H3K4me3, and H3R2me2a/K4me3) with three differentially SILAC-labeled extracts. This assay allows direct visualization of potential agonistic and antagonistic effects of modifications. The spectra in Figure 5C show that H3K4me3 binding by the TFIID complex (exemplified by its subunits TAF1 and TAF7) is compromised by the H3R2me2a modification. Importantly, binding of the BPTF protein was not affected (Figure 5C), indicating that the effect is specific to the TAF PHD finger. Together, these experiments reveal crosstalk between different histone modifications at the level of TAF3-PHD and TFIID-complex binding. Similar to trimethylation of H3K4, acetylation of the adjacent lysines (K9 and K14) is generally associated with active promoters (Millar and Grunstein, 2006Millar C.B. Grunstein M. Genome-wide patterns of histone modifications in yeast.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The TAF1 subunit of metazoan TFIID contains an acetyl-lysine binding activity residing in its double bromodomain (Jacobson et al., 2000Jacobson R.H. Ladurner A.G. King D.S. Tjian R. Structure and function of a human TAFII250 double bromodomain module.Science. 2000; 288: 1422-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). We compared the combined effects of acetylation and methylation of the histone H3 tail on TFIID and BPTF binding using the SILAC triple pull-down approach. As shown in Figure 6A, K9 and K14 acetylation had a minor effect on retention of TAF1 (and other TFIID TAFs, data not shown). BPTF, which contains both a PHD and a bromodomain, showed a similar binding behavior. The presence of the H3K4me3 mark in addition to H3K9,14Ac strongly augmented retention of TAF1 (and the other TFIID TAFs) and of BPTF (additional increase in SILAC ratio ∼10-fold). In contrast, the BAF180/polybromo subunit of the human BAF chromatin-remodeling complex, which contains multiple bromodomains but no PHD finger (Nicolas and Goodwin, 1996Nicolas R.H. Goodwin G.H. Molecular cloning of polybromo, a nuclear protein containing multiple domains including five bromodomains, a truncated HMG-box, and two repeats of a novel domain.Gene. 1996; 175: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), bound equally strong to the H3K9,14Ac and H3K4me3/K9,14Ac peptides (SILAC ratio > 8-fold over the unmodified peptide; right panel in Figure 6A). We next tested whether acetylation enhances the binding of TFIID to H3K4me3 in an experiment comparing unmodified H3 with H3K4me3 and H3K4me3/K9,14Ac peptides. As shown in Figure 6B, both TAF1 and BPTF binding to H3K4me3 was markedly increased by acetylation at H3K9 and H3K14. As expected we failed to observe preferential binding of BAF180/polybromo to the H3K4me3 peptide, whereas the protein was retained efficiently by the H3 peptide containing both acetylation and methylation marks. Affinity measurements and H3 peptide pull-downs also indicated that acetylation on K9 and K14"

Completely isolated 1D Bose gases exhibit coherence decay in excellent agreement with recent predictions. The coherence of two coupled 1D Bose gases decays to a finite value, analogous to the phase locking of two lasers by injection. Low-dimensional systems provide beautiful examples of many-body quantum physics1. For one-dimensional (1D) systems2, the Luttinger liquid approach3 provides insight into universal properties. Much is known of the equilibrium state, both in the weakly4,5,6,7 and strongly8,9 interacting regimes. However, it remains a challenge to probe the dynamics by which this equilibrium state is reached10. Here we present a direct experimental study of the coherence dynamics in both isolated and coupled degenerate 1D Bose gases. Dynamic splitting is used to create two 1D systems in a phase coherent state11. The time evolution of the coherence is revealed through local phase shifts of the subsequently observed interference patterns. Completely isolated 1D Bose gases are observed to exhibit universal sub-exponential coherence decay, in excellent agreement with recent predictions12. For two coupled 1D Bose gases, the coherence factor is observed to approach a non-zero equilibrium value, as predicted by a Bogoliubov approach13. This coupled-system decay to finite coherence is the matter wave equivalent of phase-locking two lasers by injection. The non-equilibrium dynamics of superfluids has an important role in a wide range of physical systems, such as superconductors, quantum Hall systems, superfluid helium and spin systems14,15,16. Our experiments studying coherence dynamics show that 1D Bose gases are ideally suited for investigating this class of phenomena."

Although, cytokine production by non-T cells is an important factor in helper T cell differentiation, a characteristic feature of both Th1 and Th2 lineages is their ability to secrete cytokines that promote their respective differentiation. However, cytokines produced by T cells that help to sustain Th17 cells have not yet been identified. Here we show that IL-21 is a product of Th17 cells, which is induced in a Stat3-dependent manner. Additionally, Stat3 can directly bind the Il21 promoter. IL-21 also induces IL-17 production and expression of the transcription factor, RORγt. Furthermore, generation of Th17 cells in the conventional manner is attenuated by blocking IL-21. IL-21 is known to activate Stat3 and its ability to induce Th17 differentiation is abrogated in the absence of Stat3. These data argue that IL-21 serves as an autocrine factor secreted by Th17 cells that promotes or sustains Th17 lineage commitment.

These patterns are thought to determine the success of the immune system, protect against a particular pathogen, and limit damage to host tissues (1O'Garra A. Vieira P. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Until recently, differentiating Th cells were thought to have one of two possible fates defined by their cytokine secretion, namely Th1 and Th2 (2Murphy K.M. Ouyang W. Farrar J.D. Yang J. Ranganath S. Asnagli H. Afkarian M. Murphy T.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 451-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Intracellular pathogens promote the production of IL-12 by dendritic cells. In concert, with antigen stimulation, IL-12 acting via the transcription factor Stat4, induces the development of a Th1 cell that produces the signature cytokine IFN-γ. Furthermore, IFN-γ acting via Stat1 also promotes the expression of the transcription factor T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet) which is important for Th1 differentiation (3Szabo S.J. Sullivan B.M. Peng S.L. Glimcher L.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 713-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). In contrast, helminthic pathogens promote the generation Th2 cells that produce the key cytokine IL-4, which activates Stat6 (4Ansel K.M. Djuretic I. Tanasa B. Rao A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 607-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). IL-4 has pleiotropic effects, but a key effect is the promotion of Th2 differentiation and antagonism of IFN-γ production. Thus, a classic feature of Th cells is their production of cytokines that promote their own differentiation and antagonize the differentiation to the other lineage. This simplistic dichotomotous view of T cell differentiation has recently been challenged by the discovery of a new lineage of T cells characterized by the ability to preferentially secrete a proinflammatory cytokine, IL-17 and thus designated Th17 cells (5Weaver C.T. Harrington L.E. Mangan P.R. Gavrieli M. Murphy K.M. Immunity. 2006; 24: 677-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). These T cells have been implicated in protection from extracellular bacteria (6Fedele G. Stefanelli P. Spensieri F. Fazio C. Mastrantonio P. Ausiello C.M. Infect.

Nature. 2007; 445: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). Initially, an IL-12-related cytokine also produced by dendritic cells, IL-23, was thought to be the main driver of Th17 differentiation. However, it was later recognized that IL-23 did not act on naïve CD4+ T cells to induce Th17 differentiation. Rather, other inflammatory cytokines produced by dendritic cells, IL-1, and IL-6 in conjunction with transforming growth factorβ-1 (TGFβ-1) were found to be efficient inducers of Th17 differentiation from naïve CD4+ T cell precursors. IL-23 is therefore thought to be more critical for in vivo maintenance of Th17 cells (11Weaver C.T. Hatton R.D. Mangan P.R. Harrington L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 821-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). Both IL-6 and IL-23 activate Stat3, which is found to be critical for Th17 differentiation (12Chen Z. Laurence A. Kanno Y. Pacher-Zavisin M. Zhu B.M. Tato C. Yoshimura A. Hennighausen L. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8137-8142Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 13Yang X.O.

Another key transcription factor associated with the Th17 lineage, the orphan retinoid receptor, RORγt, is critical for Th17 differentiation and is induced by the aforementioned cytokines in a Stat3-dependent manner (14Ivanov II, McKenzie B.S. Zhou L. Tadokoro C.E. Lepelley A. Lafaille J.J. Cua D.J. Littman D.R. Cell. 2006; 126: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3988) Google Scholar). As indicated, a characteristic feature of both Th1 and Th2 cells is the production of cytokines that sustain their respective differentiation, whereas simultaneously antagonizing differentiation to the opposing lineage. However, the potential cytokine that might play a similar sustaining role in Th17 cells has not been identified. In the present study, we investigated cytokines produced by Th17 cells with the goal of identifying candidates that would promote/sustain Th17 differentiation. We found that Th17 cells selectively produce IL-21. Additionally, IL-21 induces expression of RORγt, IL-17A, and IL-17F. Thus IL-21 appears to serve as an autocrine regulator of IL-17 production and serves to promote/sustain Th17 lineage commitment. Mice—Mice bearing loxP-flanked conditional (fl/fl) alleles of STAT3 on a C57BL/6J inbred background were kindly provided by David Levy (NYU, New York). Stat3fl/fl mice were bred with mice expressing Cre under the control of either the CD4 promoter (CD4-Cre) to produce Stat3fl/fl; CD4-Cre mice or the MMTV-LTR (MMTV-Cre) to produce Stat3fl/fl; MMTV-Cre mice. Animals were handled and housed in accordance with the guidelines of the NIH Animal Care and Use Committee. Isolation of Cells and Cell Culture—Splenocytes were obtained by disrupting organs of 10- to 13-week-old mice. Unless stated otherwise, all cell cultures were performed in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. T cells were enriched with a mouse CD4+ T cell kit using AutoMacs isolator (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Naive T cells were obtained by surface staining with anti-CD62L, anti-CD44, and anti-CD25. The CD62L+CD44–CD25– population was isolated by flow cytometry cell sorting with a Mo-Flo cell sorter (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Cells were activated by plate-bound anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (5 μg/ml) (BD Pharmingen) for 3 days. Th0 indicates neutral conditions (no exogenous cytokines and anti-cytokine antibodies). Th1 conditions indicate addition of IL-12 (10 ng/ml) and anti-IL-4 (10 μg/ml). Th2 conditions indicate addition of IL-4 (10 ng/ml) and anti-IL-12 (10 μg/ml). Th17 conditions indicate addition of IL-6 (10 ng/ml), TGFβ-1 (5 ng/ml), anti-IFN-γ (10 μg/ml), and anti-IL-4 (10 μg/ml). Where indicated, IL-21 (100 ng/ml) and anti-IL-21 antibody (4 μg/ml) were added to the cell cultures. All cytokines were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), except for IL-21, which was from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). All anti-cytokine antibodies were from BD Pharmingen, except for anti-IL-21 antibody, which was from R&D Systems. Measurement of Cytokines—Peripheral naïve CD4+ lymphocytes were isolated as described above. Detection of IFN-γ- and IL-17-producing cells was determined by intracellular cytokine staining with anti-IFN-γ-fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti-IL-17-phycoerythrin (BD Biosciences). Briefly, cells were stimulated for 4 h with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin. GolgiStop (BD Biosciences) was added after 2 h, and cell was fixed in 4% formyl saline. Fixed cells were stained with fluorescent antibodies in 0.1% saponin permeabilization buffer and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Events were collected and analyzed using FLOWJO software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Cytokine production in cell culture supernatants was analyzed using mouse IL-17A Quantikine assay kits (R&D Systems), IL-17F DuoSet assay kit (R&D Systems), and mouse IL-21 DuoSet assay kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA Preparation and Microarray Analysis—Total cellular RNA from cells cultured under Th0 and optimal Th17 conditions was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 10 μg of RNA was labeled and hybridized to GeneChip mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Expression values were determined using GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) v1.1.1. All data analysis was performed using GeneSpring software GX 7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Gene expression values were normalized as described previously (15Pfeffer L.M. Kim J.G. Pfeffer S.R. Carrigan D.J. Baker D.P. Wei L. Homayouni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31304-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fold induction of individual gene between Th0 and Th17 cells is represented by the ratio of normalized gene expression value in Th17 cells to value in Th0 cells. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted by RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized with Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using random hexamers as primers according to the manufacturer's instruction. Actin was used as endogenous control. TaqMan primers and probes for murine IL-21, IL-17A, IL-17F, RORγt, and actin were purchased from Applied Biosystems, and samples were analyzed using the ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP experiments were performed using the ChIP-IT™ Chromatin Immunoprecipitation kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CD4+ T cells were polarized under neutral condition (Th0) or Th17 conditions for 72 h. Anti-Stat3 antibody (sc7179; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used. ChIP samples were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using primers targeting the Il21 promoter as shown: 5′-TGCCGCTGCTTTACTCATTG-3′ and 5′-GCACCGTCAGCTTTCAGAGA-3′. Selective Production of IL-21 by Th17 Cells—To survey cytokines potentially produced by Th17 cells, we initially employed microarray analysis, comparing differentiated Th17 cells with Th0 cells. Among the genes selectively expressed by Th17 cells were Rorc (RORγt), Rora, Ccr6, Ccl20, and Il1r1, genes now known to be expressed by Th17 cells (Table 1). In addition, we noted that the gene encoding IL-21 was also selectively expressed in Th17 cells. To verify and quantify IL-21 production by Th17 cells, we sorted naïve CD4+CD62L+CD44–CD25– peripheral T cells from wild-type mice and cultured the cells under optimal Th0, Th1, Th2, and Th17 conditions for 72 h. As shown in Fig. 1, IL-21 mRNA (A) and protein (B) were expressed at low levels in Th0, Th1, and Th2 cells. By comparison, very high levels of IL-21 were generated under Th17 conditions. These results suggest that IL-21 is a product of Th17 cells, which produce much greater levels than other differentiated T cell subsets.TABLE 1Selected genes induced in Th17 cellsGene symbolFold inductionDescriptionCytokinesIl17244Interleukin 17Il216Interleukin 21ChemokinesCcl2033Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20Xcl133Chemokine (C motif) ligand 1Ccl98Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 9Ccl63Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 6Cell surface receptorsIl1r1129Interleukin 1 receptor, type ITnfrsf12a56Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 12aGpr1549G protein-coupled receptor 15Itgae28Integrin, alpha E, epithelial-associatedStab127Stabilin 1Fcgr2b23Fc receptor, IgG, low affinity IIbCcr623Chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 6Cx3cr119Chemokine (C-X3-C) receptor 1Lgr416Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 4Nuclear receptorsRorc999RAR-related orphan receptor γRora45RAR-related orphan receptor αAhr13Aryl-hydrocarbon receptorVdr7Vitamin D receptorThra5Thyroid hormone receptor α Open table in a new tab Regulation of IL-21 by Stat3—We and others have previously shown that IL-17 production is Stat3-dependent (12Chen Z.

Chem. 2007; 282: 9358-9363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). To determine whether IL-21 production might also be dependent upon this transcription factor, we analyzed IL-21 production in Stat3-deficient CD4+ T cells. Indeed, Stat3-deficient T cells cultured under standard Th17 conditions failed to produce IL-17 mRNA or protein (see below). Additionally, IL-21 mRNA (Fig. 1C) and protein (D) were also undetectable in Stat3-deficient cells even though wild-type cells cultured under the same conditions produced comparatively high levels of this cytokine. To determine whether Stat3 might play a direct role in regulating IL-21 in Th17 cells, we sought to determine whether Stat3 can bind the Il21 promoter using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 1E, Stat3 binding to the Il21 promoter was significantly enriched under Th17 culture conditions compared with Th0 conditions. Taken together, these results argue that Th17 cells selectively produce IL-21, which appears to be induced directly in a Stat3-dependent manner. IL-21 Promotes IL-17 Production by Naïve CD4+ T Helper Cells—Given the critical role of Stat3 in Th17 differentiation and given that IL-21 has been reported to selectively induce phosphorylation of Stat3 (16Zeng R. Spolski R. Casas E. Zhu W. Levy D.E. Leonard W.J. Blood. 2007; 109: 4135-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we next examined whether IL-21 could itself promote Th17 differentiation. Peripheral naïve CD4+ T cells were cultured under optimal Th17 conditions or under conditions in which IL-6 was omitted and replaced with IL-21. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, optimal Th17 conditions (IL-6 + TGFβ-1 + αIFN-γ + αIL-4) induced high levels of IL-17A, IL-17F mRNA, and proteins, as well as high proportion of IL-17A-producing cells (C). Interestingly, replacement of IL-6 with IL-21 was a very effective means of inducing IL-17-producing cells. Like IL-6 alone, IL-21 alone in the absence of TGFβ-1 had no ability to induce Th17 differentiation. The transcription factor RORγt is essential for Th17 differentiation (14Ivanov II, McKenzie B.S. Zhou L. Tadokoro C.E. Lepelley A. Lafaille J.J. Cua D.J. Littman D.R. Cell. 2006; 126: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3988) Google Scholar). Culture of naïve CD4+ T cells under standard Th17 conditions markedly up-regulates expression of this transcription factor (Fig. 2A). Importantly, under conditions in which IL-21 replaced IL-6, RORγt expression was markedly induced. As noted, like IL-6, IL-21 is a potent activator of Stat3. We therefore next assessed whether the ability of IL-21 to induce Th17 differentiation was also Stat3-dependent. Peripheral naïve CD4+ T cells from Stat3-deficient mice were cultured under optimal Th17 conditions or under conditions in which IL-6 was omitted and replaced with IL-21. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, very low level of, if any, IL-17A and IL-17F mRNA protein were detected under all four culture conditions. In addition, very few IL-17A-producing cells were found in Stat3-deficient mice (C). These results indicate that induction of IL-17 by IL-21 and TGFβ-1 depends on functional Stat3, which is analogous to stimulation in the presence of TGFβ-1 and IL-6. Neutralization of IL-21 Interferes with the Formation of Th17 Cells—Our data demonstrate that Th17 cells produce significant amounts of IL-21, and IL-21 can promote Th17 lineage differentiation. We therefore considered possibility that with the conventional means of generating Th17 cells, autocrine IL-21 was an important but previously overlooked contributor. We reasoned that if IL-21 was an important factor, neutralizing IL-21 produced by T cells would inhibit the formation of Th17 cells. Indeed, antibody blockade of IL-21 in the Th17 cultures drastically reduced IL-17A and IL-17F mRNA expression (Fig. 3A) as well as protein production detected by ELISA (B). Intracellular staining of IL-17A also indicated that neutralization of IL-21 partially blocked differentiation of Th17 cells (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that autocrine IL-21 production contributes to the optimal in vitro differentiation of Th17 cells. In this study, we report that IL-21 is a functionally important product of Th17 cells; and compared with other T cells subsets, Th17 cells selectively produce this cytokine. The induction of IL-21 is Stat3-dependent, and Stat3 directly binds the Il21 promoter, indicating that it may be a direct regulator. Although products of antigen presenting cells, including IL-6 and IL-23, are important for promoting and maintaining Th17 cells, antibody blocking experiments indicate that autocrine production of IL-21 is another previously unrecognized factor that contributes to Th17 differentiation. IL-21 is a member of the common γ chain family of cytokines, which binds to a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of IL-21 receptor and the common γ chain receptor subunit (17Kovanen P.E. Leonard W.J. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 202: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Like other members of the common γ chain family, IL-21 signaling is dependent upon Janus kinase 3 (Jak3). Although other common γ chain cytokines like IL-2 and IL-7 are major activators of Stat5, IL-21 mainly signals through Stat3 (16Zeng R. Spolski R. Casas E. Zhu W. Levy D.E. Leonard W.J. Blood. 2007; 109: 4135-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This is notable because both IL-6 and IL-23 activate Stat3 in T cells, and it is now well established that Stat3 is a critical factor in Th17 differentiation. Deficiency of Stat3 abrogates Th17 differentiation (13Yang X.O. Panopoulos A.D. Nurieva R. Chang S.H. Wang D. Watowich S.S. Dong C. J. Biol.

Laurence A. Kanno Y. Pacher-Zavisin M. Zhu B.M. Tato C. Yoshimura A. Hennighausen L. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8137-8142Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The latter is associated with widespread autoimmune disease characterized by overproduction of IL-17 and increased expression of IL-17 targets (12Chen Z. Laurence A. Kanno Y. Pacher-Zavisin M. Zhu B.M. Tato C. Yoshimura A. Hennighausen L. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8137-8142Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that IL-21 induction in Th17 cells was also dependent upon Stat3. Moreover, IL-21 activates Stat3 to promote Th17 differentiation, adding more evidence that Stat3 plays a critical role in Th17 differentiation. With respect to the importance of the different Stat3-activating cytokines, it should be noted that our results indicated that blocking IL-21 reduced, but did not abrogate IL-17 production. Additionally, one action of IL-17 is to induce IL-6 production in target cells (18Yao Z. Fanslow W.C. Seldin M.F. Rousseau A.M. Painter S.L. Comeau M.R. Cohen J.I. Spriggs M.K. Immunity. 1995; 3: 811-821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), therefore the relative roles of IL-6, IL-23 versus IL-21 in Th17 lineage differentiation will need to be carefully examined in the appropriate cytokine knock-out mice. IL-21 is known to be a product of activated CD4+ T cells (19Kim H.P. Korn L.L. Gamero A.M. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25291-25297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A major in vivo effect of IL-21 is the regulation of B cells, especially the transition of B cells to plasma cells (20Ozaki K. Spolski R. Feng C.G. Qi C.F. Cheng J. Sher A. Morse 3rd, H.C. Liu C.

Lipsky P.E. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7867-7879Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). IL-21 has also been reported to be important for the growth of CD8+ T cells (22Zeng R. Spolski R. Finkelstein S.E. Oh S. Kovanen P.E. Hinrichs C.S. Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M.F. Brady J.N. Restifo N.P. Berzofsky J.A. Leonard W.J. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In the classical view, IL-21 has been reported to be preferentially produced by Th2 cells, although IL-21 protein is not measured (23Wurster A.L. Rodgers V.L. Satoskar A.R. Whitters M.J. Young D.A.

Kopf M. Blood. 2007; 109: 2023-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Prior to the present study, the production of IL-21 in Th1 and Th2 cells was not compared with Th17 cells. We now find that Th1 and Th2 cells make little IL-21 compared with developing Th17 cells. Moreover, IL-21 promotes Th17 differentiation and seems to function analogously to the effects of Th1 and Th2 cytokines on their respective lineages. IL-21 is capable of acting on Th17 cells, in an autocrine manner, in response to antigen stimulation. Thus IL-21 serves as a factor that is produced by Th17 cells to promote or sustain their differentiation. A recent report has suggested that exposure of naïve CD4+ T cells to IL-21 inhibits Th1 differentiation and IFN-γ production (26Suto A. Wurster A.L. Reiner S.L. Grusby M.J. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3721-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, IL-21 production by Th17 cells may also be analogous to other lineage-specific cytokines (IL-4 and IFN-γ), that not only promote their respective lineage but also antagonize differentiation to other cell fates. Blocking IL-21/IL-21 receptor system has been reported to reduce disease progression in murine lupus (27Herber D. Brown T.P. Liang S. Young D.A. Collins M. Dunussi-Joannopoulos K. J.

Our finding that IL-21 promotes Th17 differentiation may explain the underlining mechanism of the efficacy of this therapy. It will be of great interest to determine the importance of IL-21 in human Th17 differentiation and to assess whether blocking of IL-21 signaling is effective in human diseases associated with overproduction of IL-17.

https://openalex.org/W1974652594,"Adult mammalian testis is a source of pluripotent stem cells. However, the lack of specific surface markers has hampered identification and tracking of the unrecognized subset of germ cells that gives rise to multipotent cells. Although embryonic-like cells can be derived from adult testis cultures after only several weeks in vitro, it is not known whether adult self-renewing spermatogonia in long-term culture can generate such stem cells as well. Here, we show that highly proliferative adult spermatogonial progenitor cells (SPCs) can be efficiently obtained by cultivation on mitotically inactivated testicular feeders containing CD34+ stromal cells. SPCs exhibit testicular repopulating activity in vivo and maintain the ability in long-term culture to give rise to multipotent adult spermatogonial-derived stem cells (MASCs). Furthermore, both SPCs and MASCs express GPR125, an orphan adhesion-type G-protein-coupled receptor. In knock-in mice bearing a GPR125-beta-galactosidase (LacZ) fusion protein under control of the native Gpr125 promoter (GPR125-LacZ), expression in the testis was detected exclusively in spermatogonia and not in differentiated germ cells. Primary GPR125-LacZ SPC lines retained GPR125 expression, underwent clonal expansion, maintained the phenotype of germline stem cells, and reconstituted spermatogenesis in busulphan-treated mice. Long-term cultures of GPR125+ SPCs (GSPCs) also converted into GPR125+ MASC colonies. GPR125+ MASCs generated derivatives of the three germ layers and contributed to chimaeric embryos, with concomitant downregulation of GPR125 during differentiation into GPR125- cells. MASCs also differentiated into contractile cardiac tissue in vitro and formed functional blood vessels in vivo. Molecular bookmarking by GPR125 in the adult mouse and, ultimately, in the human testis could enrich for a population of SPCs for derivation of GPR125+ MASCs, which may be employed for genetic manipulation, tissue regeneration and revascularization of ischaemic organs."
https://openalex.org/W2132889863,"For more than three decades, acetaminophen (INN, paracetamol) has been claimed to be devoid of significant inhibition of peripheral prostanoids. Meanwhile, attempts to explain its action by inhibition of a central cyclooxygenase (COX)-3 have been rejected. The fact that acetaminophen acts functionally as a selective COX-2 inhibitor led us to investigate the hypothesis of whether it works via preferential COX-2 blockade. Ex vivo COX inhibition and pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen were assessed in 5 volunteers receiving single 1000 mg doses orally. Coagulation-induced thromboxane B(2) and lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E(2) were measured ex vivo and in vitro in human whole blood as indices of COX-1 and COX-2 activity. In vitro, acetaminophen elicited a 4.4-fold selectivity toward COX-2 inhibition (IC(50)=113.7 micromol/L for COX-1; IC(50)=25.8 micromol/L for COX-2). Following oral administration of the drug, maximal ex vivo inhibitions were 56% (COX-1) and 83% (COX-2). Acetaminophen plasma concentrations remained above the in vitro IC(50) for COX-2 for at least 5 h postadministration. Ex vivo IC(50) values (COX-1: 105.2 micromol/L; COX-2: 26.3 micromol/L) of acetaminophen compared favorably with its in vitro IC(50) values. In contrast to previous concepts, acetaminophen inhibited COX-2 by more than 80%, i.e., to a degree comparable to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and selective COX-2 inhibitors. However, a >95% COX-1 blockade relevant for suppression of platelet function was not achieved. Our data may explain acetaminophen's analgesic and antiinflammatory action as well as its superior overall gastrointestinal safety profile compared with NSAIDs. In view of its substantial COX-2 inhibition, recently defined cardiovascular warnings for use of COX-2 inhibitors should also be considered for acetaminophen."
https://openalex.org/W2004583393,"Electromagnetic signals in circuits consist of discrete photons, though conventional voltage sources can only generate classical fields with a coherent superposition of many different photon numbers. While these classical signals can control and measure bits in a quantum computer (qubits), single photons can carry quantum information, enabling non-local quantum interactions, an important resource for scalable quantum computing. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip single photon source in a circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) architecture, with a microwave transmission line cavity that collects the spontaneous emission of a single superconducting qubit with high efficiency. The photon source is triggered by a qubit rotation, as a photon is generated only when the qubit is excited. Tomography of both qubit and fluorescence photon shows that arbitrary qubit states can be mapped onto the photon state, demonstrating an ability to convert a stationary qubit into a flying qubit. Both the average power and voltage of the photon source are characterized to verify performance of the system. This single photon source is an important addition to a rapidly growing toolbox for quantum optics on a chip."

However, both pleasant and aversive stimuli can elicit arousal and attention, and their salience or intensity increases when they occur by surprise. Thus, adaptive behavior may require that neural circuits compute both stimulus valence—or value—and intensity. To explore how these computations may be implemented, we examined neural responses in the primate amygdala to unexpected reinforcement during learning. Many amygdala neurons responded differently to reinforcement depending upon whether or not it was expected. In some neurons, this modulation occurred only for rewards or aversive stimuli, but not both. In other neurons, expectation similarly modulated responses to both rewards and punishments. These different neuronal populations may subserve two sorts of processes mediated by the amygdala: those activated by surprising reinforcements of both valences—such as enhanced arousal and attention—and those that are valence-specific, such as fear or reward-seeking behavior.

These different neuronal populations may subserve two sorts of processes mediated by the amygdala: those activated by surprising reinforcements of both valences—such as enhanced arousal and attention—and those that are valence-specific, such as fear or reward-seeking behavior. Food, water, mates, and predators do not always appear predictably in a natural environment. Instead, animals and humans often encounter these stimuli by surprise, triggering a range of cognitive, physiological, and behavioral responses that contribute to an emotional experience. One influential framework describes emotions in a two-dimensional space, with arousal (ranging from calm to excited) and valence, or value, (ranging from highly negative to highly positive) comprising the two axes (Russell, 1980Russell J.A. A circumplex model of affect.J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 1980; 39: 1161-1178Crossref Scopus (7663) Google Scholar). In support of this framework, some components of the emotional response, such as approach or defensive behaviors, depend on computations of the positive or negative value of stimuli. Other components of the emotional response, such as metabolic arousal, increased attention, and the enhancement of memory formation, are common to intense stimuli of both valences. Distinct psychophysiological measures correlate with arousal and valence, respectively (Lang and Davis, 2006Lang P.J. Davis M. Emotion, motivation, and the brain: reflex foundations in animal and human research.Prog. Brain Res. 2006; 156: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Finally, in addition to triggering these different aspects of emotional responses, surprising reinforcement can also induce learning—such that past experience is used to behave adaptively in the future—a point emphasized in many theoretical models of reinforcement learning (Mackintosh, 1975Mackintosh N.J. A theory of attention: variations in the associability of stimuli with reinforcement.Psychol. Rev. 1975; 82: 276-298Crossref Scopus (1957) Google Scholar, Pearce and Hall, 1980Pearce J. Hall G.

Neurobiological and psychological accounts of emotion often posit opponent motivational systems, one for appetitive, or reward-related, processes and one for aversive processes (Daw et al., 2002Daw N.D.

Rev. 1974; 81: 119-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Within this conceptualization, affective valence and arousal are determined by the relative activation and intensity of activation, respectively, of these two systems (Lang and Davis, 2006Lang P.J. Davis M. Emotion, motivation, and the brain: reflex foundations in animal and human research.Prog. Brain Res. 2006; 156: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Arousing pleasant or aversive stimuli can therefore elicit valence-specific responses while also enhancing autonomic reactivity (e.g., blood pressure, skin conductance responses), attention, and memory formation through a common, perhaps valence-insensitive, pathway. Thus, appetitive and aversive brain systems may act in an opponent manner, for valence-specific processes, as well as in a congruent manner, for processes sensitive to affective intensity but not valence. The amygdala, a brain structure located in the medial temporal lobe that has been implicated in emotional processes, is well positioned to integrate information from appetitive and aversive systems in order to direct emotional responses. Information about primary pleasant and aversive stimuli converges in the amygdala, which receives input from sensory systems of all modalities (Amaral et al., 1992Amaral D. Price J. Pitkanen A.

Output from the amygdala to subcortical structures and to the striatum, hippocampus, and cortex could help coordinate a range of physiological, cognitive, and behavioral responses (Amaral et al., 1992Amaral D.

Oxford University Press, New York2000: 213-287Google Scholar). Some of these responses are valence specific, such as freezing behavior (a component of fear responses; LeDoux, 2000LeDoux J.E. Emotion circuits in the brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (5782) Google Scholar), and others are insensitive to valence, such as activation of the sympathetic nervous system in relation to arousal (Lang and Davis, 2006Lang P.J. Davis M. Emotion, motivation, and the brain: reflex foundations in animal and human research.Prog. Brain Res. 2006; 156: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We were interested in understanding whether the amygdala processes primary reinforcement in a manner that could support its role in both valence-based and arousal-based emotional responses. To examine this issue, we focused on the effect of predictability on the responses of amygdala neurons to rewards and aversive stimuli. We measured amygdala responses to rewards and aversive stimuli during two experimental procedures that manipulated monkeys' ability to anticipate reinforcement. In one procedure, a trace-conditioning task, monkeys learned that the presentation of a conditioned stimulus (CS) predicted an unconditioned stimulus (US, a reward or an aversive stimulus). In the other procedure, rewards and aversive stimuli were delivered in an uncued and unpredictable manner. Although this procedure did not place behavioral demands on the monkeys, we refer to it as the “random task” for convenience. Since variables other than reinforcement expectation, such as attention or cognitive load, may also differ between these two tasks, we use a comparison of responses to reinforcement during the trace-conditioning and random tasks to identify cells with potential effects of expectation. To confirm that in these cells expectation modulates reinforcement responses, we then examine neural responses to reinforcement in relation to learning and behavioral signs of expectation during the trace-conditioning task. We found that expectation indeed influences the responses of amygdala neurons to reinforcement. Some cells showed a similar effect of expectation on responses to rewards and punishments. In other cells, however, expectation modulated the responses to either rewards or aversive stimuli, but not both. Neurons with congruent effects of expectation on responses to reinforcement of both valences are well-suited to support processes such as attention, attention-based learning, arousal, and the enhancement of memory formation, all of which have been shown to involve the amygdala (Holland and Gallagher, 1999Holland P.C.

On the other hand, neurons that preferentially modulate their responses to either pleasant or aversive stimuli could play a role in processes that require information about stimulus valence (i.e., positive or negative value). Many of these processes, which include learning when to exhibit defensive as opposed to approach behaviors, among others, are also likely to involve the amygdala (Baxter and Murray, 2002Baxter M. Murray E.A. The amygdala and reward.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, Everitt et al., 2003Everitt B.J. Cardinal R.N. Parkinson J.A. Robbins T.W.

The primate amygdala represents the positive and negative value of visual stimuli during learning.Nature. 2006; 439: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In the trace-conditioning task, if predictability modulates neural responses to reinforcement, then these responses should change as monkeys learn to accurately anticipate reinforcement. Indeed, in the cells that respond more to reinforcers during the random task than during the trace-conditioning task, we found that responses to rewards and aversive stimuli were stronger before learning, when monkeys did not expect the reinforcement, and that these responses decreased as monkeys learned. This expectation-dependent modulation of reinforcement responses bears similarity to a “prediction error signal,” which in theoretical accounts of reinforcement learning represents the difference between expected and received reinforcement (Pearce and Hall, 1980Pearce J. Hall G. A model for Pavlovian conditioning: variations in the effectiveness of conditioned but not unconditioned stimuli.Psychol. Rev. 1980; 87: 532-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar, Rescorla and Wagner, 1972Rescorla R.A. Wagner A.R.

Appleton Century Crofts, New York1972: 64-99Google Scholar, Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R. Barto A. Reinforcement Learning. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar). However, the response profile of amygdala neurons that we studied cannot be described as simply encoding “pure” prediction errors because they carried other, additional signals. For example, we have previously shown that amygdala neurons are selective for the identity and value of visual CSs (Paton et al., 2006Paton J. Belova M. Morrison S. Salzman C. The primate amygdala represents the positive and negative value of visual stimuli during learning.Nature. 2006; 439: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), and here we also show that these neurons can also respond to USs selectively. Instead, the influence of predictability on amygdala responses to reinforcement suggests that amygdala neurons may combine prediction error signal input with other signals carried by the amygdala during learning. These inputs may converge onto amygdala neurons in distinct patterns so as to support both valence-specific and arousal-specific processes. To examine the effect of reinforcement expectation on neural responses in the amygdala, we measured neural activity during performance of two behavioral tasks: one in which reinforcement was predictable (trace-conditioning task) and another in which it was not (random task). In the trace-conditioning task, monkeys learned that USs (liquid rewards or aversive air-puffs directed at the face) were predicted by visual CSs. To assess learning, we measured two behaviors: licking a spout in anticipation of reward and blinking in anticipation of an air-puff (Figure 1A). (In different experiments, reinforcements occurred with a probability of 100% or 80%, which we will refer to as the 100% and 80% reinforced trace-conditioning tasks.) Subsequent to learning the initial CS-US contingencies, we reversed them without warning, and monkeys learned these new contingencies. In the random task, we recorded activity while presenting rewards and punishments with an equal probability but now in an uncued and unpredictable manner (Figure 1B). Monkeys did not lick or blink in anticipation of reinforcement during the random task, indicating that they did not predict reinforcement. We recorded the activity of 285 amygdala neurons from 5 monkeys during both the trace-conditioning and random tasks (100% reinforced task, 116 cells, 63 and 53 from monkeys V and P, respectively; 80% reinforced task, 169 cells, 46, 41, 25, 33, and 24 cells from monkeys V, P, Lo, R, and Lu, respectively). We examined activity in the 50–600 ms after reinforcement. The responses to reinforcement often differed in the two tasks, with some neurons exhibiting differential responses to rewards only, other neurons to punishments only, and some neurons to both rewards and punishments. For example, Figures 2A and 2B show activity from an amygdala neuron that responded more strongly when reward was delivered unexpectedly (random task) than when the same reward was delivered in a cued manner (trace-conditioning task). This cell did not respond to air-puffs during either task. Other amygdala neurons showed stronger responses to unexpected air-puffs but did not modulate their responses to reward (e.g., Figures 2C and 2D). Finally, many cells had stronger responses to both unexpected rewards and air-puffs, as exemplified by the cell shown in Figures 2E and 2F. The response profiles of the neurons depicted in Figure 2 suggest that expectation has differential effects on different populations of amygdala neurons. To examine this systematically, we used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to categorize each neuron according to whether it responded significantly more to unexpected reward only, air-puff only, or both during the random task as compared to each respective reinforcer when it was expected during the trace-conditioning task (p < 0.05, one-tailed permutation test). Forty-seven out of two hundred eighty-five cells had differential responses for reward responses alone (expectation-modulated for reward cells, rEM), 35/285 cells for air-puff responses alone (expectation-modulated for aversive stimuli cells, aEM), and 65/285 cells for both types of reinforcement (nonvalenced expectation-modulated cells, nEM). Figures 3A–3F show normalized and averaged neural activity for the rEM, aEM, and nEM cells. These plots combine data from all five monkeys because the proportion of rEM, aEM, and nEM neurons did not vary significantly between monkeys (χ2 test, p > 0.05; see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). rEM, aEM, and nEM neurons were represented in our sample of neurons more often than would be expected by chance (χ2 test, p > 0.05 for each response profile type). In addition, across the population, the effects of expectation on responses to rewards and air-puffs were not independent (χ2 test, p < 0.001). Neurons that showed (or did not show) stronger responses to unexpected rewards tended to show (or not show) stronger responses to air-puffs, with the incidence of nEM cells occurring at a rate greater than expected by chance given the observed frequencies of each type (binomial test, p < 10−5). Together, the findings suggest that different populations of neurons in the amygdala could subserve valence-specific and valence-nonspecific functions. We have not noticed any clear anatomical clustering of reward-related versus punishment-related effects of expectation on reinforcement responses; these cells appeared to be intermingled within the amygdala (Figure 1C). In general, the modulation of reinforcement responses in the random task compared to the trace-conditioning task was greater when reinforcement during trace conditioning occurred with a probability of 100% (Figures 3G–3I). These data are consistent with the notion that CSs do not fully predict reinforcement when delivery occurs with a probability of 80%; consequently, the difference in the predictability of rewards and air-puffs between the two tasks is smaller. The interpretation that expectation modulates neural responses to reinforcement was also supported by an analysis of data from within the trace-conditioning task, using monkeys' anticipatory behavior as a proxy for their expectation. Recall that on the trace-conditioning task, monkeys learned to lick in anticipation of reward and blink in anticipation of an aversive air-puff. Assuming that licking but not blinking indicates expectation of reward, and vice-versa for expectation of air-puff, we asked whether reinforcement responses were higher when monkeys incorrectly predicted the upcoming reinforcement. Combining all the rEM, aEM, and nEM cells, we divided trials into two categories: one containing trials in which the monkey blinked but did not lick, and the other containing trials in which the monkey licked but did not blink. For each reinforcement type, we normalized responses within experiments in the same manner as for population peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) and then combined data across experiments to compare activity in the two categories. For both reward and air-puff, we found that reinforcement responses were significantly greater when the monkey predicted the wrong type of reinforcement (Figures 4A and 4B; analysis performed in 100 ms bins, stepped in 20 ms steps). These effects were weakened but not eliminated if the first four trials of initial learning and the first four trials after reversal were removed (most “incorrect” predictions occurred during these learning trials). In addition, the effects were smaller on the task with 80% reinforcement probability (Figure S1). Overall, this analysis further supports the notion that responses to reinforcement in the amygdala are modulated by expectation and that violations of expectation have a greater impact on neural responses on the 100% reinforcement probability task. So far we have focused on comparisons of responses to expected and unexpected reinforcement. Next, we examined whether the omission of an expected reinforcement also modulates amygdala neural activity by considering data from the 169 neurons studied during the 80% reinforced trace-conditioning task. In this task, reinforcement was omitted on 20% of trials. To detect reinforcement omission, monkeys must internally time when reinforcement should occur in relation to a CS presentation. The inherent variability of internal timing, combined with inherent variability of neural response latencies to reinforcement, led us to use an analysis of response latency to find neurons that responded to omitted rewards and punishments. This analysis identified whether and when a neuron significantly changed its response around the time of expected reinforcement when such reinforcement was omitted (p < 0.05, see Experimental Procedures). Of note, many amygdala neurons have low baseline firing rates (56% of neurons had baseline firing rates below 10 Hz), limiting the sensitivity of statistical approaches for detecting significant decreases in firing rate. Figures 5A and 5B show a cell identified by the analysis of latency that fires somewhat more strongly to unexpected as compared to expected reward and that decreases its firing rate to omitted rewards. In addition, the same cell increases its firing rate when an air-puff is omitted, and it decreases its firing rate to both predicted and unpredicted air-puffs. Thus, this cell's response profile reveals opponent effects of rewards, punishments, and their omission in relation to expectation. Figures 5C and 5D show similar opponent effects for a cell that increases its response to unexpected air-puff but not reward. Strikingly, an omitted reward also elicits an increase in response, and an omitted punishment elicits a modest decrease in response. Theories of reinforcement learning often posit that valence-specific signals that represent the receipt or omission of reinforcement in relation to expectation play an instructive role in learning (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972Rescorla R.A. Wagner A.R. A theory of Pavlovian conditioning: variations in the effectiveness of reinforcement and non-reinforcement.in: Black A.H. Prokasy W.F.

Thirty-two out of one hundred sixty-nine (19%) neurons responded with significantly less firing to omitted rewards and/or significantly greater firing to omitted air-puffs (Figures 5E and 5F; see Table 1), as determined by the analysis of response latency. These neurons encode outcomes of omitted reinforcement that are better than expected by increasing firing rate and/or of omitted reinforcement worse than expected by decreasing firing rate. Figures 5G and 5H show the response profile for the 26/169 (15%) neurons identified by the latency analysis as decreasing firing rate significantly after omitted air-puffs and/or increasing firing rate significantly after omitted reward. The neurons in Figures 5E and 5F and Figures 5G and 5H are nonoverlapping populations (Table 1). Neurons from each of the five monkeys contributed to each panel depicted in Figures 5E–5H. From 50–600 ms after reinforcement, all curves within Figures 5E–5H are significantly different from each other (t tests, p < 0.05 in each case), and on average omitted reinforcement resulted in a significant decrease in firing in Figures 5E and 5H (p < 0.01, t tests).Table 1Categorization of Cells According to Their Response to Omitted ReinforcementCells were categorized as increasing, decreasing, or not changing firing rate by comparing activity after an omitted reinforcement to activity in the last 1 s of the trace interval. Open table in a new tab Cells were categorized as increasing, decreasing, or not changing firing rate by comparing activity after an omitted reinforcement to activity in the last 1 s of the trace interval. These data show that a small number of neurons in the amygdala modulate their firing rate when reinforcement is omitted. Such neurons often appear to integrate information about appetitive and aversive stimuli in relation to expectation in an opponent fashion, with omitted reinforcement having an opposite influence on firing rate for rewards and aversive stimuli. Across all 169 neurons, however, on average omitted reinforcement did not result in a significant change in firing rate (Figures 5I and 5J, t tests comparing activity from the last 500 ms of the trace interval to activity 50–600 ms after the time of reinforcement, p > 0.05 for both omitted reward and air-puff responses). In addition, the responses after omitted reinforcement differed from the responses to expected rewards and air-puffs (t test, p < 0.05). Thus, omitted reinforcement has both a smaller and less-frequent effect on firing rate than the increase in fi"

The results we present here demonstrate FSP27/Cidec to be a novel lipid droplet protein that shares many features characteristic of the lipid droplet protein perilipin (19Londos C. Sztalryd C.

Our data also reveal that a mechanism whereby FSP27/Cidec functions to promote triglyceride deposition in adiocytes is by inhibiting lipolysis. FSP27 is thus a major new modulator of lipid droplet function that is required for optimal storage of triglycerides by adipocytes. Materials—C57BL/6J (male, 10 weeks old) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Human insulin was obtained from Lilly. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Atlanta Biologicals, Inc.

PCR was performed by using 5′-linker having BalII restriction and 3′-linker containing EcoRI site. After cutting with the enzymes (BalII and EcoRI), the purified PCR fragment was cloned into pEGFPC1 vector (Clontech). GFP-FSP27 cDNA was transfected in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). The efficiency of transfection using Lipofectamine Plus reagent was very low. The transfection was also carried out by electroporating the adipocytes with 5 μg of cDNA (200,000 cells/200 μl of PBS) in a 0.4-cm cuvette at 180 V and 950 microfarads with a time constant of 20 ms on a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II system. Immunofluorescence in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—For determination of perilipin localization, cells were cultured on coverslips. Adipocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min), permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS (15 min), blocked with 1% fetal bovine serum in PBS (1 h) and treated with guinea pig anti-perilipin polyclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution; Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ) and a rabbit anti-guinea pig Texas Red-labeled secondary antibody (abCAM, Cambridge, MA). For FSP27 immunostaining, 3T3-L1 adipocytes plated on coverslips were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 25 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and then washed three times again with PBS. The cells were then exposed to affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal FSP27 antibodies (obtained from Drs. Kasuga and Nishino, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan) for 60 min at room temperature after blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 60 min at room temperature. Following three washes with PBS, the cells were treated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes; 1:1000 dilution) for 60 min at room temperature. Fluorescence imaging was assessed by confocal microscopy. Oil Red-O Staining for Intracellular Triglycerides—Oil Red-O (0.4%) in isopropyl alcohol solution was freshly made, mixed with one-half volume of H2O, and filtered through 0.45-μm filter. To stain for triglycerides or neutral lipids, cells in the monolayer were first washed three times with PBS and then fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution in PBS (20 min). After six washes, fixed cells were stained with the freshly prepared Oil Red-O solution for 10 min at room temperature, followed by six washes with water. For quantitating Oil Red-O staining, imaging was performed using a wide field fluorescence microscope with a ×63 Nikon PlanApo objective. In any given experiment, all pictomicrographs were exposed identically and subtracted for background where the background was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity of a section of the image without cells. The fluorescence intensity of Oil Red-O was measured using Axiovision digital imaging software version 4.1 (Carl Zeiss) by marking the periphery of individual cells. Assay to Measure Glycerol Release—The cultured adipocytes were washed twice with PBS and incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer supplemented with 4% bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of epinephrine and theophylline. After 3 h of incubation, the buffer was collected, and glycerol contents were measured using free glycerol determination kit (Sigma) by following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes or from WAT using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) primers and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real time PCR was performed in a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics) using SYBR Green 1 PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics) and specific primers to amplify the genes. Primer sequences may be obtained on request. Confocal Microscopy—Images were taken on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu digital camera and processed using Metamorph imaging software, version 6.1 (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). FSP27/Cidec is a member of the CIDE family of proteins that share a conserved amino-terminal CIDE-N domain and COOH-terminal CIDE-C domain (Fig. 1A). Three CIDEs have been reported in mouse (Cidea, Cideb, and FSP27/Cidec) and human (CIDEA, CIDEB, and CIDEC) (24Liang L. Zhao M. Xu Z. Yokoyama K.K. Li T. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The CIDE-N domain of CIDE proteins has significant homology to the regulatory domains of the apoptotic DNA fragmentation factors, DFF40 (caspase-activated nuclease) and DFF45 (inhibitor) (16Danesch U. Hoeck W. Ringold G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7185-7193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The CIDE proteins, including FSP27/Cidec, can promote apoptosis when highly expressed ectopically in cultured cells (24Liang L. Zhao M. Xu Z. Yokoyama K.K. Li T. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, FSP27/Cidec was originally identified as a highly expressed, endogenous adipocyte-specific protein by subtractive cloning techniques that provided no insight into its function in these cells (16Danesch U. Hoeck W. Ringold G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7185-7193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We confirmed that FSP27/Cidec is highly expressed in mouse WAT and BAT, although detectable expression was also observed in mouse skeletal muscle and liver (data not shown). Our analysis of FSP27/Cidec expression in 3T3-L1 cells also indicated a 59-fold increase in FSP27/Cidec mRNA expression during adipogenesis, consistent with previous findings (16Danesch U. Hoeck W. Ringold G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7185-7193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Novartis GNF gene atlas shows that the human homolog of FSP27, CIDEC, is highly expressed in human white adipose tissue (15Su A.I. Cooke M.P. Ching K.A. Hakak Y. Walker J.R. Wiltshire T. Orth A.P. Vega R.G. Sapinoso L.M. Moqrich A. Patapoutian A. Hampton G.M. Schultz P.G. Hogenesch J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4465-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar), with little or no expression detectable in other tissues. Previous studies have suggested FSP27/Cidec may be partially localized with mitochondria in COS cells, based on expression of a fusion protein of FSP27/Cidec and green fluorescent protein (FSP27-GFP) (24Liang L. Zhao M. Xu Z. Yokoyama K.K. Li T. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To obtain clues to FSP27/Cidec function specifically in adipose cells, we prepared a similar FSP27-GFP construct and expressed this protein in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Fig. 1B shows a typical adipocyte expressing this construct. FSP27-GFP is strikingly localized to distinct spherical structures, as visualized by confocal microscopy at multiple optical planes and restored as a projected image. In the adipocyte shown in Fig. 1B, it is also apparent that the spherical structures surrounded by FSP27-GFP are lipid droplets heavily stained with Oil Red-O, which partitions in neutral lipid (26Shillabeer G. Forden J.M. Lau D.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 84: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Tobe K. Kasuga M. Kitasato H. Takaku F. Takano T. Segawa K. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The efficiency of transfection using Lipofectamine was very low. We also used an electroporation method for transfecting the cDNA, which increased the transfection efficiency with no difference in the results. Interestingly, a previous report listed FSP27/Cidec as one of many proteins found to be present in preparations of lipid droplets after their isolation from adipocytes (28Brasaemle D.L. Dolios G. Shapiro L. Wang R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46835-46842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). However, in those studies microscopic examination of FSP27/Cidec localization was not performed. To confirm that endogenous FSP27/Cidec also localized to lipid droplets, immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on 3T3-L1 adipocytes using affinity-purified FSP27/Cidec antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, FSP27/Cidec was observed concentrated around the lipid droplets. The pattern of FSP27/Cidec localization around the lipid droplets appeared to be discontinuous rather than a continuous ring (Fig. 1E). Some punctate cytoplasmic staining was also observed in these experiments, although this could be due to some nonspecific binding of the antibody. We next attempted to resolve the discrepancy between the data shown in Fig. 1 suggesting FSP27/Cidec is a lipid droplet protein in adipocytes versus the published data indicating it partially colocalizes with mitochondria in COS cells (24Liang L. Zhao M. Xu Z. Yokoyama K.K. Li T. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Careful high resolution confocal microscopy was performed on adipocytes expressing both FSP27-GFP and the mitochondria-localized MitoTracker Red 633 dye. As shown in Fig. 2A, FSP27-GFP is strikingly localized to distinct spherical structures visualized by confocal microscopy at various optical planes (Fig. 2A; also see supplemental Fig. 1). Merged images at all optical planes through the cultured adipocytes again confirmed FSP27-GFP localizes to large spherical structures (Fig. 2B). Virtually no colocalization of FSP27-GFP with MitoTracker could be observed. We also failed to observe significant colocalization of expressed FSP27-GFP with mitochondria in COS cells (data not shown). This disposition of FSP27-GFP is reminiscent of the first described endogenous lipid droplet-associated protein perilipin, which also localizes to the periphery of intracellular neutral lipid storage droplets in adipocytes (20Greenberg A.S.

The localization of FSP27-GFP in fully differentiated adipocytes was thus compared with that of endogenous perilipin detected by immunofluorescence using anti-perilipin antibody. A 0.4-μm optical Z-section from a mature adipocyte is shown in Fig. 2C, which depicts extensive colocalization of expressed FSP27-GFP with endogenous perilipin. Taken together, the data in Figs. 1 and 2 reveal FSP27/Cidec as a novel lipid droplet protein with a cellular disposition similar to the known lipid droplet protein perilipin. Perilipin is known to strongly enhance triacylglycerol storage by inhibiting lipolysis in adipocytes (31Brasaemle D.L. Levin D.M. Adler-Wailes D.C. Londos C. Biochim. Biophys.

Therefore, we tested the effect of FSP27-GFP expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes on total neutral lipid accumulation by staining the cells with Oil Red-O. These experiments revealed that preadipocytes expressing FSP27-GFP display lipid droplets of increased size compared with neighboring untransfected cells (Fig. 3A). In these transfected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, FSP27-GFP was either associated with these lipid droplets in punctate structures or appeared as distinct rings around the periphery of lipid droplets (Fig. 3A). Quantification of the Oil Red-O intensity in cells transfected with FSP27/Cidec revealed significantly higher neutral lipid stores as compared with control, untransfected preadipocytes (Fig. 3C). A similar result was obtained when FSP27-GFP was expressed in COS cells (Fig. 3, B and C) or Chinese hamster ovary cells (not shown). In all cases, FSP27-GFP expression increased lipid droplet size and increased total neutral lipid. Consistent with the concept that perilipin has little or no effect on the triacylglycerol synthetic pathway while inhibiting triglyceride hydrolysis (31Brasaemle D.L. Levin D.M. Adler-Wailes D.C. Londos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), adipocytes from perilipin null mice exhibit increased basal lipolysis and a blunted response to lipolytic agents such as catecholamines (37Souza S.C. Muliro K.V. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto M.T. Schaffer J.E. Dallal G.E. Wang X. Kraemer F.B. Obin M. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8267-8272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We thus tested the effects of either perilipin or FSP27/Cidec depletion on lipolysis in cultured adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 4B, siRNA-directed silencing of either of these proteins elicited significant increases in glycerol release under basal conditions, as has been observed previously in perilipin-deficient adipocytes (32Martinez-Botas J. Anderson J.B. Tessier D. Lapillonne A. Chang B.H. Quast M.J. Gorenstein D. Chen K.H. Chan L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). About an 80% decrease in FSP27 mRNA and a 90% decrease in perilipin mRNA expression was observed (Fig. 4C). Previous studies have revealed that upon stimulation of adipocytes by β-adrenergic agents, perilipin is rapidly phosphorylated and appears to be required for optimal responsiveness to lipolytic agents (32Martinez-Botas J. Anderson J.B. Tessier D. Lapillonne A. Chang B.H. Quast M.J. Gorenstein D. Chen K.H. Chan L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 38Clifford G.M. Londos C.

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: S672Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, FSP27/Cidec or perilipin depletion did not compromise the responsiveness of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to either sub-maximal or maximal concentrations of epinephrine plus theophylline in the present experiments (Fig. 4B). It is possible that the failure of perilipin or FSP27/Cidec depletion to attenuate the stimulated lipolytic rates observed in response to catecholamine and theophylline is because of incomplete depletion of these proteins. Nonetheless, basal lipolysis is clearly up-regulated by the partial loss of either of these proteins under the conditions of these experiments. Interestingly, when FSP27/Cidec is depleted from fully differentiated, cultured adipocytes, the lipid droplets were uniformly dispersed into smaller structures than those displayed by control cells (Fig. 4A). This phenomenon also occurs upon chronic stimulation of lipolysis by catecholamines, but it appears not to be required for optimal lipolytic rates under those conditions (40Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Adler-Wailes D.C. Levin D.M. Kimmel A.R. Rondinone C.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 892: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 41Hickenbottom S.J. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. Hurley J.H. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that FSP27/Cidec may function to promote the formation of the large lipid droplets seen in primary fat cells. The formation of lipid droplets from the endoplasmic reticulum requires a complex series of steps and components, and the size of droplets likely depends on a carefully controlled pathway (42Wolins N.E. Brasaemle D.L. Bickel P.E. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 43Wolins N.E. Quaynor B.K. Skinner J.R. Schoenfish M.J. Tzekov A. Bickel P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19146-19155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Our data to date do not permit us to determine the step or steps in this process that FSP27/Cidec regulates, a question that future studies will address. Also of interest is whether the apparent fragmentation of lipid droplets upon loss of FSP27/Cidec is directly related to the increase in lipolysis observed under these conditions. Nonetheless, the data in Fig. 4 show that loss of FSP27/Cidec both enhances basal lipolytic rates and disperses lipid droplets in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In a similar study, Nishino et al. 3N. Nishino and M. Kasuga, personal communication. have also observed that FSP27/Cidec contributes to efficient energy storage in WAT by promoting formation of unilocular lipid droplets in adipocytes. Perilipin and other related lipid droplet proteins such as ADRP and TIP47 contain PAT domains involved in their lipid binding function, but other lipid droplet proteins do not seem to contain this domain (for overview, see Ref. 44Beckman M. Science. 2006; 311: 1232-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). FSP27/Cidec does not contain a highly conserved PAT domain, nor does it apparently display protein kinase A phosphorylation sites characteristic of perilipin. Instead, FSP27/Cidec contains CIDE domains and shares significant sequence similarity to Cidea (25Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), a BAT protein in mouse that has been reported to be mitochondrial when expressed ectopically in cultured cells (45Zhou Z. Yon Toh S. Chen Z. Guo K. Ng C.P. Ponniah S. Lin S.C. Hong W. Li P. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Cidea is poorly expressed in WAT in the mouse such that its function seems to be mostly restricted to BAT in this animal. Cidea-null mice have a lean phenotype with resistance to diet-induced obesity and diabetes (45Zhou Z. Yon Toh S. Chen Z. Guo K. Ng C.P. Ponniah S. Lin S.C. Hong W. Li P. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). This phenotype was attributed to the ability of Cidea to apparently inhibit the activity of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein UCP1. However, it will be interesting to further explore this hypothesis in light of the data presented here indicating a Cidea isoform, FSP27/Cidec, is a lipid droplet protein rather than a mitochondrial protein. Our results reveal the important function of FSP27/Cidec to augment lipid storage during and after adipogenesis, which in turn likely plays an important role in whole body energy homeostasis. It will be interesting in future studies to determine the structural basis for interaction of FSP27/Cidec with lipid droplets and to unravel its mechanism of action to negatively regulate lipolysis.

https://openalex.org/W2037284663,"To survive extremely different environments, intracellular parasites require highly adaptable physiological and metabolic systems. Leishmania donovani extracellular promastigotes reside in a glucose-rich, slightly alkaline environment in the sand fly vector alimentary tract. On entry into human macrophage phagolysosomes, promastigotes differentiate into intracellular amastigotes. These cope with an acidic milieu, where glucose is scarce while amino acids are abundant. Here, we use an axenic differentiation model and a novel high-coverage, comparative proteomic methodology to analyze in detail protein expression changes throughout the differentiation process. The analysis identified and quantified 21% of the parasite proteome across 7 time points during differentiation. The data reveal a delayed increase in gluconeogenesis enzymes, coinciding with a decrease in glycolytic capacity. At the same time, beta-oxidation, amino acid catabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial respiration chain, and oxidative phosphorylation capacities are all up-regulated. The results indicate that the differentiating parasite shifts from glucose to fatty acids and amino acids as its main energy source. Furthermore, glycerol and amino acids are used as precursors for sugar synthesis, compensating for lack of exogenous sugars. These changes occur while promastigotes undergo morphological transformation. Our findings provide new insight into changes occurring in single-cell organisms during a developmental process."

https://openalex.org/W2158484702,"The hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 is selectively expressed in the endothelium of lymphatic capillaries, where it has been proposed to function in hyaluronan clearance and hyaluronan-mediated leukocyte adhesion. However, recent studies suggest that hyaluronan homeostasis is unperturbed in LYVE-1(-/-) mice and that lymphatic adhesion/transmigration may be largely mediated by ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 rather than LYVE-1. Here we have explored the possibility that LYVE-1 functions during inflammation and report that the receptor is down-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Using cultured primary lymphatic endothelial cells, we show that surface expression of LYVE-1 is rapidly and reversibly lost after exposure to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and TNFbeta via internalization and degradation of the receptor in lysosomes, coupled with a shutdown in gene expression. Curiously, internalization does not result in significant uptake of hyaluronan, a process that is largely insensitive to the novel LYVE-1 adhesion blocking monoclonal antibody 3A, and proceeds almost equally in resting and inflammation-activated lymphatic endothelial cells. Finally, we show that TNF can induce down-modulation of LYVE-1 in ex vivo murine dermal tissue explants and present evidence that the process occurs in vivo, in the context of murine allergen-induced skin inflammation. These findings suggest that LYVE-1 can function independently of hyaluronan and have implications for the use of LYVE-1 as a histological marker for lymphangiogenesis in human pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1976529372,"Chronic hypoxia and inflammatory cytokines are hallmarks of inflammatory joint diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), suggesting a link between this microenvironment and central pathological events. Because TACE/ADAM17 is the predominant protease catalyzing the release of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), a cytokine that triggers a cascade of events leading to RA, we examined the regulation of this metalloprotease in response to hypoxia and TNFα itself. We report that low oxygen concentrations and TNFα enhance TACE mRNA levels in synovial cells through direct binding of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) to the 5′ promoter region. This is associated with elevated TACE activity as shown by the increase in TNFα shedding rate. By the use of HIF-1-deficient cells and by obliterating NF-κB activation, it was determined that the hypoxic TACE response is mediated by HIF-1 signaling, whereas the regulation by TNFα also requires NF-κB activation. As a support for the in vivo relevance of the HIF-1 axis for TACE regulation, immunohistological analysis of TACE and HIF-1 expression in RA synovium indicates that TACE is up-regulated in both fibroblast- and macrophage-like synovial cells where it localizes with elevated expression of both HIF-1 and TNFα.

The importance of TACE substrates in a variety of physiological functions, including development, is underscored by the fact that in vivo inhibition of TACE or disruption of the TACE gene results in the death of mice between embryonic day 17.5 and the first day after birth, due to a number of developmental defects. In addition, the implication of TACE substrates in immunoregulation has made this enzyme an efficient therapeutic target in the treatment of a number of pathological conditions including airway inflammation, cancer, and arthritis. Because of the pathophysiological importance of TACE-mediated shedding, several studies have addressed the mechanism of TACE regulation. Surprisingly, few agents, which are known to enhance ectodomain shedding of proteins have been documented for their role in the regulation of TACE expression. Increased levels of TACE mRNA were observed in murine retinal endothelial cells or human endothelial cells exposed to vascular endothelial growth factor (11Majka S. McGuire P.G. Das A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 260-266PubMed Google Scholar) or TNFα (12Bzowska M. Jura N. Lassak A. Black R.A. Bereta J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2808-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), respectively. In addition, several studies have shown that TACE expression is elevated under pathological conditions. In mammary tumor tissues, TACE protein levels are higher than in normal tissues (13Fabre-Lafay S. Garrido-Urbani S. Reymond N. Goncalves A. Dubreuil P. Lopez M. J. Biol.

Oncol. 2005; 131: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Also, elevated levels of TACE mRNA expression were found in osteoarthritis (15Weir E.C. Philbrick W.M. Amling M. Neff L.A. Baron R. Broadus A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-affected cartilage as compared with normal cartilage (16Patel I.R. Attur M.G. Patel R.N. Stuchin S.A. Abagyan R.A. Abramson S.B. Amin A.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160 (4579): 4570PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that abnormal TACE activity may contribute to the development of several pathological conditions, including RA. Despite this, the mechanisms involved in TACE regulation under pathological conditions remain unknown. It has been known for many decades that hypoxic conditions prevail in RA-affected joints. In fact, even in normal joints, the high cavity pressure upon movement and the scarcity of blood vessels make the oxygen tension lower than in other tissues (17Mapp P.I. Grootveld M.C. Blake D.R. Br. Med. Bull. 1995; 51 (436): 419Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 18Silver I.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1975; 271: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Also, due to inflammation in the growing synovial membrane during RA development, there is increasing metabolic needs in the arthritic joints, resulting in insufficient oxygen uptake (17Mapp P.I. Grootveld M.C. Blake D.R. Br. Med. Bull. 1995; 51 (436): 419Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 19Dingle J.T. Thomas D.P. Br. J. Exp. Pathol. 1956; 37: 318-323PubMed Google Scholar). It is well known that hypoxia induces the expression of a number of transcription factors involved in arthritis, such as ETS-1 (20Oikawa M. Abe M. Kurosawa H. Hida W. Shirato K. Sato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (21Koong A.C. Chen E.Y. Mivechi N.F. Denko N.C. Stambrook P. Giaccia A.J.

Among these, HIF-1 was shown to regulate the expression of a variety of genes implicated in arthritis, an important one being vascular endothelial growth factor, a growth factor involved in the perpetuation of the abundant vasculature found in the synovia (23Nagashima M. Yoshino S. Ishiwata T. Asano G. J. Rheumatol. 1995; 22: 1624-1630PubMed Google Scholar). HIF-1 is composed of two subunits, HIF-1α and HIF-1β/ARNT. Both subunits are members of the basic-loop-helix-PAS protein family (24Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5134) Google Scholar). Whereas HIF-1β is constitutively expressed, HIF-1α undergoes proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions. On the other hand, it is stabilized under oxygen deprivation to eventually translocate to the nucleus where it heterodimerizes with HIF-1β. The resulting HIF-1 complex binds to hypoxia-responsive elements (HRE), composed of the HIF-1 binding sequence and HIF-1 ancillary sequence, to regulate gene expression (25Wenger R.H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1151-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 26Kimura H. Weisz A. Ogura T. Hitomi Y. Kurashima Y. Hashimoto K. D'Acquisto F. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2292-2298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Beside hypoxia, several lines of evidence indicate that HIF-1 can accumulate and be transcriptionally activated during normoxia by cytokines, growth factors, hormones, nitric oxide, and loss of the tumor suppressor protein pVHL or PTEN (27Berra E. Ginouves A. Pouyssegur J. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 4145Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Among these, TNFα, a proinflammatory cytokine deeply involved in the development of arthritis, was shown to regulate HIF-1α accumulation and HIF-1 activity (28Sandau K.B. Zhou J. Kietzmann T. Brune B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39805-39811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 29Zhou J. Fandrey J. Schumann J. Tiegs G. Brune B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C439-C446Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because both hypoxia and TNFα are characteristic of the inflammatory microenvironment found in rheumatoid arthritis-affected joints, we investigated their involvement in the regulation of TACE expression. In this report, we demonstrated that TACE promoter activity, mRNA, and protein are increased in response to both hypoxia and TNFα. The hypoxic response was shown to be mediated by HIF-1, whereas the regulation of TACE gene expression by TNFα also requires the transcription factor NF-κB. These findings provide a new mechanism by which TACE could be increased in rheumatoid arthritis-affected joints and thereby impact the bioavailability of TNFα. Cell Culture—The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (HyClone, Logan, UT), and 40 μg/ml garamycin (Schering Canada Inc., Pointe-Claire, QC, Canada). The human monocytic cell line THP-1 was obtained from ATCC and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 40 μg/ml garamycin. Their differentiation into adherent macrophage cells was induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 nm). The wild-type and the HIF-1α knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts were a generous gift from Dr. Darren Richard (Centre de Recherche de l'Hôtel-Dieu, QC, Canada). The mouse hepatoma cell line Hepa-1 c1c7 was obtained from ATCC and the Hepa-1 c4 cells, derived from Hepa-1 c1c7, were a generous gift from Dr. Oliver Hankinson (University of California, Los Angeles, CA). All these cell lines were cultured in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma) and 40 μg/ml garamycin (Schering Canada). The protocol used for the isolation of rat synovial cells is a modified version of previously described methods (30Firestein G.S. Zvaifler N.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1987; 30 (871): 864Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, the synovial membranes were isolated from the knees of healthy specific pathogen-free inbred Lewis female rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) under sterile conditions, and were digested in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) collagenase type IV (0.2 mg/ml) solution (Sigma) for 2 h in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were then washed by centrifugation in sterile PBS. The synovial cells were allowed to adhere to 100-mm Petri dishes containing Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium/F-12 (Invitrogen), 20% FBS (Sigma), and 40 μg/ml garamycin (Schering Canada). During following passages, FBS concentrations were gradually decreased to 10%. All cell cultures were kept in a humidified 95% O2, 5%CO2 incubator at 37 °C. For hypoxic experiments, cells were serum starved and placed in a sealed humidified chamber maintained at 1% O2, 5%CO2 and balanced in N2 for different time periods as indicated in the figure legends. Plasmids for Transient Transfections—The vectors pcDNA3-HIF-1α, pcDNA3-HIF-1β, and (HRE)3-Luc were generously provided by Dr. Darren Richard (Centre de Recherche de l'Hôtel-Dieu). The IκBSR was kindly provided by Dr. C. Jobin (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC); pNFκB-Luc was from Stratagene. The pcDNA3-hTNFα was a generous gift from Dr. Franck Peiretti (Laboratoire d'hématologie, Marseille, France). The TACE promoter sequence (-2304 to -1 bp) was amplified by PCR using the following oligonucleotide pair: (forward) 5′-GGCCGAGCTCGACTAAGATAAAGGCTTGTAGCC-3′ (the underline indicates SacI cleavage site) and (reverse) 5′-GGCCCTCGAGGTTCCCGTCCACCACCTCTCTGG-3′ (the underline indicates XhoI cleavage site). The DNA extracted from C57BL/6J mouse cells was used as template. PCR conditions were: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of amplification with a denaturation step at 95 °C for 15 s, an annealing temperature of 59 °C for 60 s, and an extension step at 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 8 min. The resulting fragment was inserted into the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega) and sequenced. TACE promoter 5′ deletants, pTACE-1567, -991, -903, and -410 were generated by digestion of the pTACE-Luc with the appropriate restriction enzymes. The shorter TACE promoter, pTACE-H6, was generated by PCR amplification using the same technique as described above for the pTACE-Luc vector. The primer pair used was: (forward) 5′-GGCCGAGCTCGGCGGCGCGGGAGGGAGAAGTTT-3′ (the underline indicates SacI cleavage site) and (reverse) 5′-GGCCCTCGAGGTTCCCGTCCACCACCTCTCTGG-3′ (the underline indicates XhoI cleavage site) and sequenced. The H3-HIF-1 binding and H4-HRE sequences located at positions -960 and -607 bp, respectively, within the TACE promoter, were mutated by PCR. Distinct mutations were generated by replacing the H3 motif 5′-AATGTGC-3′ by 5′-AATGGCC-3′ and/or the H4 motif 5′-GCACACCCGATCCGCGTGG-3′ by 5′-GGCCACCCGATCCCGGTGG-3′ (the mutated base pairs are underlined). The integrity of these mutants was verified by sequencing. Luciferase Assays—Cells were transiently transfected by the CaPO4 precipitation technique using a Mammalian Cell Transfection Kit (Specialty Media, Lavallette, NJ) as previously described (31Langlois M.F. Zanger K. Monden T. Safer J.D. Hollenberg A.N. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24927-24933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with 2 μg/well of vectors as indicated in the figure legends. Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were serum starved 3 h prior to overnight stimulation in hypoxic conditions (1% O2) with or without murine TNFα (PeproTech Canada Inc., Ottawa, ON, Canada) as indicated in the figure legends. Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity as previously described (31Langlois M.F. Zanger K. Monden T. Safer J.D. Hollenberg A.N. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24927-24933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The control pGL2-Basic vector was routinely used as an internal control of transfection. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were seeded in 100-mm Petri dishes at a density of 1 × 106. The following day, they were serum starved prior to stimulation with 20 ng/ml of murine TNFα (PeproTech Canada Inc.) under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions for 16 h. For nuclear extract preparation, we used a modification of the protocol described by Dignam et al. (32McDonald P.P. Fadok V.A. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163 (6172): 6164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9168) Google Scholar). Total cell lysates and immunoblotting were performed as previously described (34Blanchette F. Rivard N. Rudd P. Grondin F. Attisano L. Dubois C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33986-33994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The membranes were probed overnight with the following primary antibodies: anti-TACE at 1:1000 (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), anti-HIF-1α at 1:250 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), antiactin at 1:5000 (Sigma), or anti-nucleoporin p62 (Nup62) at 1:1000 (BD Transduction Laboratories). The secondary antibodies were peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit for TACE and actin or peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse for HIF-1α and Nup62 (Amersham Biosciences, Baie d'Urfé, QC, Canada). Blots were developed using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). RT-PCR and Quantitative Real-time PCR—One million cells were seeded in 100-mm Petri dishes. The following day, they were serum starved prior to stimulation with 20 ng/ml of murine TNFα or incubation in normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) for the indicated time periods. In selected experiments, cells were pretreated with 20 μg of actinomycin D (Merck Frosst, Kirkland, QC, Canada) 30 min before stimulation. Total RNA was isolated using the TRI-Reagent protocol as previously described (35Chomczynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15 (536-537): 532-534PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was achieved using random decamer primers (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). The PCR were performed using the following primer pairs: TACE (forward) 5′-GGCAACTCCAGGGTGGACGAAGGA-3′, (reverse) 5′-ATCTTCAGCATCTCCTGGTGGGGG-3′; ADAM10 (forward) 5′-GTGCCAGTACAGGCTCTTTGC-3′, (reverse) 5′-CACAGTAGCCTCTGAAGTCATTACATG-3′; MMP-1 (forward) 5′-TCTGGAGTGATGTGACACCAC-3′, (reverse) 5′-GGGCCTGGTGGGAATGTGTGA-3′; MMP-13 (forward) 5′-GATGATCCCACCTTAGACATCATGAGAAAA-3′, (reverse) 5′-GCAGTGCCATCATAGATTCTGGTG AAA-3′, and 18 S (forward) 5′-AGGAATTGACGGAAGGGCAC-3′, (reverse) 5′-GTGCAGCCCCGGACATCTAAG-3′. Quantitative Real-Time PCR was performed using a Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Research, Kirkland, QC, Canada). The reaction mixtures containing SYBR Green were generated following the manufacturerŉs protocol. The cycling program was: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, 40 cycles of amplification with a denaturation step at 95 °C for 15 s, an annealing temperature of 60 °C (MMP-1 and MMP-13) or 68 °C (TACE and ADAM10) for 45 s, and an extension step at 72 °C for 30 s. Confocal Microscopy—Synoviocytes were cultured on cover-slips in complete medium. Cells were serum starved for 3 h before overnight stimulation in normoxia or hypoxia (1% O2) in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml of murine TNFα. Cells were then prepared for immunofluorescence staining as previously described (34Blanchette F. Rivard N. Rudd P. Grondin F. Attisano L. Dubois C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33986-33994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with cooled PBS and then fixed for 15 min in precooled (-20 °C) methanol/acetone (30/70). After a 15-min rehydration in PBS, cells were permeabilized in PBS with 0.1% Triton for 5 min and nonspecific binding was blocked by a 20-min incubation step in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Fixed cells were then incubated overnight with anti-TACE primary antibody (1:100), washed in PBS, and incubated for 1 h with anti-Rb-Cy2 secondary antibody (1:200). Cellular localization of TACE was examined with a scanning confocal microscope (NORAN Instruments Inc., Middleton, WI) equipped with a krypton/argon laser. Images were obtained and treated with INTERVISION software (NORAN Instruments Inc.) on a Silicon Graphics O2-work station. Image processing and surface quantification of pixel intensities were done using the ImageJ public domain software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). For fluorescence quantification, images were processed with ImageJ software for a total of 35 slices per cells. Data were expressed as the sum of pixel intensities (SPI) for 5 cells/experimental condition. TNFα Measurement—Synoviocytes were transiently transfected by electroporation using the Nucleofector System from Amaxa Biosystems. Five μg of human pcDNA3-TNF were transfected in 2 × 106 cells using the U23 nucleofection program. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were serum starved and incubated overnight under normoxic or hypoxic conditions (1% O2) with or without 20 ng/ml of murine TNFα. Supernatants were harvested and cell lysates were prepared as described above. Amounts of human TNFα were measured in cell lysates and in culture media using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, according to the manufacturerŉs protocol (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Synoviocytes were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells in Petri dishes, serum starved, and exposed or not to either TNFα or hypoxia for 16 h. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using the EZ ChIP assay kit (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturerŉs protocol. Briefly, cross-linking was achieved by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% and incubating at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were washed with cold PBS, collected, pelleted, and resuspended in lysis buffer. Cell lysates were sonicated to achieve DNA sizes ranging from 200 to 1000 bp. Diluted supernatants were then pre-cleared by incubating with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose, 50% slurry for 60 min at 4 °C and treated with anti-HIF-1α antibodies (Novus Biologicals number 100-123) or isotype-matched antibodies (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose, 50% slurry, washed, eluted, and cross-linkage was reversed by heating at 65 °C. The eluates were then digested with proteinase K-treated DNA as a template for PCR amplification of the target sites in TACE promoter. Primer sequences used for amplification of relevant HRE sites-containing regions were: (forward) 5′-AGTGAAAGTGTTTATACCTCGG-3′ and (reverse) 5′-ACTGAACATTAATAGCCCTGGT-3′ for the H3 region and (forward) 5′-GTCCCCTGAGCATTTTCAGTGACAA-3′ and (reverse) 5′-CGTGATTAAAGTCCCCTTCAGCGTC-3′ for the H4 site. Immunohistochemistry—Human synovial tissue samples were obtained from three patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology revised criteria for RA (36Arnett F.C. Edworthy S.M. Bloch D.A. McShane D.J. Fries J.F. Cooper N.S. Healey L.A. Kaplan S.R. Liang M.H. Luthra H.S. et al.Arthritis Rheum. 1988; 31: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (18759) Google Scholar) and one osteoarthritis patient undergoing total joint replacement surgery, with the collaboration of Dr. Manuela Pelmus from the Department of Pathology (Faculty of Medicine, Universitéde Sherbrooke). The rheumatoid arthritis patients, one male and two females, were positive for the rheumatoid factor. Paraffin-embedded synovial tissue sections were deparaffinized and endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min. Sections were permeabilized in 2% saponin for 30 min at 4 °C, boiled for 10 min for antigen retrieval, and allowed to cool for another 10 min. Bovine serum albumin 2% blocking solution (supplemented with 5% milk proteins and 10% goat anti-serum for TACE) was added for 30 min before incubation with primary antibodies for 90 min: anti-TACE 1:300, anti-HIF-1 1:50, anti-TNFα 1:50 (generously provided by Dr. Fred Finkelman, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH), and anti-CD68 1:80 (Serotec, Oxford, UK). Following washes with PBS, sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 30 min, washed again with PBS, and incubated 15 min with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Following washes in PBS, the color was revealed by an incubation of 2 min with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) and the tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin. For TACE and HIF-1 double staining experiments, HIF-1 was stained using the peroxidase technique and TACE with the alkaline phosphatase technique (DakoCytomation K0391) according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. Statistical Analysis—Results were analyzed using unpaired Studentŉs t test. Hypoxia and TNFα Increase TACE Protein Levels and Activity by Up-regulating Its Transcription—Few stimuli are known to modulate TACE mRNA expression. Among these, TNFα was shown to increase TACE mRNA levels in endothelial cells, suggesting a role for this cytokine in the regulation of TACE in other cell types (12Bzowska M. Jura N. Lassak A. Black R.A. Bereta J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2808-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is well known that large amounts of TNFα are present in the synovial membrane of arthritic joints, a diseased tissue also characterized by the presence of numerous hypoxic areas (37Moss M.L. White J.M. Lambert M.H. Andrews R.C. Drug. Discov. Today. 2001; 6: 417426Google Scholar, 38Peters C.L. Morris C.J. Mapp P.I. Blake D.R. Lewis C.E. Winrow V.R. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To define the impact of such an inflammatory/hypoxic milieu on TACE expression, cultured synovial cells were exposed to low oxygen concentrations in the presence or absence of TNFα, and TACE mRNA expression was assessed by real-time PCR. Results indicated that although TNFα has a noticeable but nonsignificant increase in TACE mRNA expression at 4 h, a 3.1- and 4.3-fold increase was observed at 8 and 16 h, respectively (Fig. 1A)."

Vibrio parahemeolyticus is a marine bacterium and causative agent of gastroenteritis associated with the consumption of contaminated seafood. It is endemic to Southeast Asia and is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in Japan (1Morris Jr., J.G. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2003; 37: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the V. parahemeolyticus genome revealed the presence of two type III secretion systems each encoded in separate pathogenicity islands (2Makino K. Oshima K. Kurokawa K. Yokoyama K.

Lancet. 2003; 361: 743-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Type III secretion systems are used by bacterial pathogens to inject effector proteins into the cytoplasm of the host cells (3Ghosh P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 771-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Upon delivery into the host cytosol, the effectors manipulate host signaling to gain an advantage for the infecting pathogen. The bacterial effectors are proposed to usurp or mimic eukaryotic activity that is then used to target and deregulate normal functions in the host cell by either up- or down-regulating signaling pathways (4Orth K. Microbe (Wash., D. C.). 2007; 2: 183-186Google Scholar). However, the bacterial effector proteins must initially be kept in a quiescent state within the bacterium. This is accomplished by a variety of methods, including their association with a chaperone in the bacterial cytosol, their specificity for a substrate, and/or their requirement for an activator or modification that is only provided by a eukaryotic source (4Orth K. Microbe (Wash., D. C.). 2007; 2: 183-186Google Scholar, 5Viboud G.I. Bliska J.B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). VopA (Vibrio outer protein A) is an effector found within one of the V. parahemeolyticus pathogenicity islands, and is a member of a family of type III effectors called YopJ-like proteins that are found in a wide variety of pathogens including other animal pathogens, plant pathogens, and the plant symbiont Rhizobium (5Viboud G.I.

Palmer L.E. Bao Z.Q. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). All YopJ-like proteins contain a catalytic triad, and it was recently shown that YopJ functions as an acetyltransferase (8Mukherjee S. Hao Y.H. Orth K. Trends Biochem.

Hao Y.H. Orth K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 210-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). YopJ was demonstrated to inhibit the MAPK and NFκB signaling pathways by acetylating the critical serine and threonine residues found on the activation loop of MAPK kinases (MKKs), thereby blocking their activation by phosphorylation (8Mukherjee S.

VopA inhibits MAPK signaling using a novel mechanism distinct from those described for other bacterial toxins that disrupt this signaling pathway. This effector potently inhibits MAPK signaling but shows no inhibitory effect on the NFκB pathway (11Trosky J.E. Mukherjee S. Burdette D.L. Roberts M. McCarter L. Siegel R.M. Orth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51953-51957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Herein, we show that VopA acetylates a conserved lysine located in the catalytic loop of all kinases that plays a critical role in the binding of the γ-phosphate of ATP. Modification of this lysine by acetylation inhibits the binding of ATP, but not ADP, to the MAPK kinase, resulting in an inactivate kinase. These findings uncover a unique mechanism that targets a critical conserved lysine residue involved in coordinating nucleotide binding that could also be used by eukaryotic enzymes. Cloning—pSSFV VopA-FLAG and pSFFV VopA-C167A constructs were generated as described previously (11Trosky J.E. Mukherjee S. Burdette D.L. Roberts M. McCarter L. Siegel R.M. Orth K. J. Biol.

For bacterial overexpression, VopA and VopA-C167A were amplified by PCR using pSFFV VopA or pSFFV VopA-C167A as template with 5′-EcoRI and 3′-stop-XhoI primers and cloned into pGEX-tobacco etch virus (a kind gift from Y. M. Chook). The resulting construct has a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag on the N-terminus of VopA with both thrombin and tobacco etch virus cleavage sites in the linker. For expression in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, VopA and VopA-C167A were amplified by PCR using pSFFV VopA or pSFFV VopA-C167A as template with 5′-HindIII and 3′-FLAG-stop-BamHI primers and cloned into pMMB67HE (a kind gift from J. B. Bliska). Y. pseudotuberculosis Strains—YP126 (wild type) and YP26 (ΔYopJ) were kind gifts from J. B. Bliska. For expression of pMMB67HE VopA-FLAG and pMMB67HE VopA-C167A-FLAG in YP26, the constructs were transformed into SM10λpir. Overnight cultures of SM10 strains were grown at 37 °C, and overnight cultures of YP26 were grown at 26 °C. 200 μl of each strain was mixed and spotted onto an LB agar plate. Plates were incubated at 37 °C right side up for several hours. Bacteria were scraped off plates, replated onto M9 agar plates supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and grown at 26 °C. Colonies were picked, and VopA and VopA-C167A expression were verified by Western blot with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Macrophage Infections—Y. pseudotuberculosis infections were performed as described previously (12Palmer L.E. Hobbie S. Galan J.E. Bliska J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In brief, J774A.1 murine macrophages were seeded into 6-well dishes at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), penicillin/streptomycin/glutamate (Invitrogen), and sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). To induce type III secretion, overnight cultures of Yersinia strains were diluted back to an OD of 0.1 in LB supplemented with 20 mm sodium oxalate and 20 mm magnesium chloride and grown at 26 °C for 1 h. Cultures were then shifted to 37 °C for 2 h. Bacteria cells (1 × 108 cells) were pelleted and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Bacteria were overlaid onto macrophages and plates spun at 500 × g for 5 min to bring bacteria into contact with the cells. Plates were kept at 37 °C for 15 min and 45 min. Plates were put on ice and cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed for 10 min in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 μm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, and Complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm. 150 μl of cleared lysate were boiled with 50 μl of 5× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot with α-phospho-JNK and α-JNK or α-phospho-p38 and α-p38. Epistasis Assays—293T cells were transfected with or without a MAPK (HA-ERK, 200 ng) in the presence or absence of pSFFV VopA or pSFFV VopA-C167A (50 ng) with vector RasV12 (100 ng), Raf BxB (gift from Mike White) (10 ng), or MKK1 ED (100 ng). After 36 h of growth, cells were starved for 3 h followed by treatment or no treatment with a stimulus (epidermal growth factor, 50 ng/ml). Cells lysates were analyzed by immunoblot with rabbit anti-phospho-ERK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and mouse anti-HA antibody (Babco). Protein Purification—GST-VopA wild type and GST-VopA-C167A constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-DE3 cells and purified by GST affinity chromatography. In brief, cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6 to 0.8 in 2× yeast extract and tryptone medium and then induced with 400 μm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Roche Applied Science) for 4 h at 25 °C. The cells were lysed in PBS-T (phosphate-buffered saline (pH 8), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Fisher), 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)) using a cell disrupter (EmulsiFlex-C5, Avestin, Inc.). The lysates were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads, and bound protein was subjected to GST-tobacco etch virus cleavage overnight in PBS-T supplemented with 1 mm acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) (Sigma) at room temperature. Flow-through was collected and incubated with GST beads to remove any remaining GST-tobacco etch virus. Flow-through was collected and concentrated in a 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off Amicon-Ultra concentrator (Fisher). rMKK6 construct was expressed in Rosetta Blue cells (Novagen) and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. In brief, cells were grown and lysed as above, except cells were induced with 200 μm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown at 25 °C for 8 h. Lysates were bound to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Sigma). Bound protein was washed and eluted per the manufacturer's protocol. His-MKK1 was expressed and purified as His-MKK6 except cells were induced with 400 μm of isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown at 25 °C for 4 h. In Vitro Acetylation Assay—Acetylation assays were performed as described (9Mukherjee S. Keitany G. Li Y. Wang Y. Ball H.L. Goldsmith E.J. Orth K. Science. 2006; 312: 1211-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In brief, purified His-MKK6, His-MKK1, or p38 (a kind gift from John Humphreys) was incubated with VopA or VopA-C167A in the presence of 14C-labeled acetyl-CoA for 1 h at 30 °C in acetylation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol (Fisher), 100 μm EDTA (Fisher), 1 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)). The mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were incubated with Amplify fluorographic reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by autoradiography. Molecular Weight Measurement—The protein molecular weight was measured on a Sciex QSTAR XL mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) with an off-line electrospray ionization source. The electrospray tips were purchased from Proxeon Biosystems. Sample solution was desalted using a Millipore C18 ZipTip and eluted with 80% acetonitrile. The eluates were dried, and then resuspended in 1% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile. Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry—The tryptic digests of the sample were fractionated using a Dionex LC-Packings HPLC. Peptides were first desalted on a 300-μm × 1-mm PepMap C18 trap column with 0.1% formic acid in HPLC grade water at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. After desalting for 5 min, peptides were flushed onto a LC Packings 75-μm × 15-cm C18 nanocolumn (3 μm, 100 Å) at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. A 45-min gradient was used for the HPLC separation with the acetonitrile concentration increased from 2 to 45%. Elutes were analyzed with a QSTAR XL mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Data were acquired in information dependent acquisition mode where the top three precursor ions were selected per cycle for the tandem mass spectrometry experiment. Mass ranges for the mass spectrometry survey scan and tandem mass spectrometry were m/z 300-1800 and m/z 50-1800, respectively. Raw data were processed by Analyst QS to generate the peak list (PKL) file. Data were searched using the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science Ltd., London) against the SwissProt data base and the home-built data base that contains the sequence of the MEKK6 protein. Nucleotide Binding Assay—Purified His-MKK1 (1 μm) was preincubated with acetyl-CoA in the presence or absence of purified VopA (50 nm) or VopA-C167A (50 nm) in 20 mm Hepes pH 7.5 (Sigma), 10 mm MgOAc, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma) for 2 h at 30 °C. N-Methyl-3′-O-anthranoyl (MANT)-ATP (25 μm) or MANT-ADP (25 μm) was added to appropriate samples. Emission scans were measured on a fluorimeter (Photon Technology, Inc.) from 300 to 550 nm with an excitation wavelength of 290 nm. VopA Inhibits Mammalian MAPK Activation—We have shown previously that VopA is able to inhibit the ERK-MAPK signaling pathway in mammals and the high osmolarity growth pathway in yeast (11Trosky J.E. Mukherjee S. Burdette D.L. Roberts M. McCarter L. Siegel R.M. Orth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51953-51957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To confirm that VopA inhibits other mammalian MAPK pathways, we analyzed the activation of the p38-MAPK and JNK-MAPK pathways by assessing the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK in the presence and absence of VopA or the catalytically inactive form of VopA (VopA-C167A) where the catalytic cysteine is mutated to an alanine (Fig. 1). For this analysis, VopA or VopA-C167A was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pMMB67HE and conjugated into a Y. pseudotuberculosis strain that is deleted for YopJ (12Palmer L.E. Hobbie S. Galan J.E. Bliska J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These strains were used to infect J744A.1 murine macrophages to test the ability of VopA to rescue the deleted YopJ strain by restoring the inhibition of the p38 or JNK pathways. Infection with the wild type Yersinia strain that contains YopJ efficiently inhibits both the p38 and JNK-MAPK pathways (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3, and B, lanes 2 and 3, respectively), whereas the Yersinia strain deleted for YopJ does not inhibit these signaling pathways (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5, and B, lanes 4 and 5, respectively) (12Palmer L.E. Hobbie S. Galan J.E. Bliska J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the p38 and JNK phosphorylation was restored in the YopJ deletion strain by induced expression of VopA (Fig. 1A, lanes 8 and 9, and B, lanes 8 and 9, respectively) but not the catalytically inactive VopA-C167A (Fig. 1A, lanes 12 and 13, and B, lanes 12 and 13, respectively). VopA Inhibits Downstream of MKK Activation—To determine the point at which VopA blocks the MAPK pathway, we performed a series of epistasis experiments. Consistent with previous findings, when the MAPK pathway is stimulated with an external stimulus (such as epidermal growth factor) VopA, but not VopA-C167A, is able to inhibit the ERK-MAPK pathway as demonstrated by the lack of phosphorylated HA-ERK in treated cells (Fig. 2A) (11Trosky J.E. Mukherjee S. Burdette D.L. Roberts M. McCarter L. Siegel R.M. Orth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51953-51957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of endogenous ERK is observed because of the background from nontransfected, stimulated cells (Fig. 2A) (11Trosky J.E. Mukherjee S. Burdette D.L. Roberts M. McCarter L. Siegel R.M. Orth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51953-51957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of this pathway by transfected RasV12 or B-Raf BxB is also inhibited by wild type VopA, but not mutant VopA-C167A, as demonstrated by analysis of ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively). Surprisingly, when an activated form of MKK1, MKK1 ED, is used to activate the pathway just upstream of ERK, VopA is still able to inhibit phosphorylation of HA-ERK (Fig. 2D). This observation is in contrast to the inhibitory profile of YopJ, which is unable to inhibit signaling in the presence of an activated MKK (7Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.Q. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we concluded that VopA inhibits MAPK signaling downstream of MKK1 activation and upstream of ERK activation. VopA Acetylation of MKK6 Inhibits Activation—Given that VopA only affects the MAPK signaling pathways and that it also inhibits the activation of MAPKs, we predicted the molecular target of VopA would be MAPKs (11Trosky J.E. Mukherjee S. Burdette D.L. Roberts M. McCarter L. Siegel R.M. Orth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51953-51957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, because of the fact that VopA is a member of the family of YopJ-like proteins and that YopJ is an acetyltransferase, we hypothesized that VopA functions as an acetyltransferase that acetylates and inhibits MAPK activation (8Mukherjee S. Hao Y.H. Orth K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 210-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we used purified p38 in an in vitro acetylation assay with purified wild type and mutant VopA. However, we observed that neither VopA nor the catalytically inactive VopA-C167A acetylates p38 (Fig. 3A). However, as a control we included rMKK6 as a substrate and discovered that VopA, but not mutant VopA-C167A, is able to acetylate rMKK6. Previously, YopJ was observed to acetylate rMKK6 on its activation loop, thereby preventing phosphorylation by upstream kinases (9Mukherjee S. Keitany G. Li Y. Wang Y. Ball H.L. Goldsmith E.J. Orth K. Science. 2006; 312: 1211-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 10Mittal R. Peak-Chew S.Y. McMahon H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 18574-18579Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To determine whether VopA modifies rMKK6 in a similar manner, we tested whether rMKK6 is phosphorylated by upstream kinases in the presence or absence of VopA using a previously established in vitro signaling assay (9Mukherjee S. Keitany G. Li Y. Wang Y. Ball H.L. Goldsmith E.J. Orth K. Science. 2006; 312: 1211-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). rMKK6 was preincubated with GST-VopA or GST-VopA-C167A in the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA followed by incubation with membrane-free lysates derived from serum-stimulated cells. In control samples without VopA, rMKK6 was phosphorylated and activated by upstream kinases as indicated by immunoblot analysis with an anti-phospho-MKK6 antibody (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). However, when rMKK6 is preincubated with wild type VopA in the presence of acetyl-CoA, rMKK6 is no longer activated by phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, lane 4). By contrast, incubation of the kinase with mutant VopA-C167A has no inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of rMKK6 (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6). Although these results demonstrate that VopA can inhibit activation of MKKs by acetylation, they do not explain how VopA is able to inhibit activated MKKs. VopA Acetylates Four Conserved Residues in MKK6—To determine how VopA acetylates MKK6, we first assessed the total mass of rMKK6 isolated from bacterial cells expressed either alone (rMKK6) or in the presence of GST-VopA (rMKK6+V) for total mass spectrometric analysis. The mass of rMKK6 is observed as one strong peak at 39,655 kDa, but the mass of rMKK6+V is divided among five peaks, with mass differences in increments of 42 Da, equal to the mass of one acetyl group (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that VopA acetylates four residues on rMKK6. To determine which four residues of rMKK6 are modified by GST-VopA, the samples were subjected to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analyses. No acetylation was observed for rMKK6, whereas rMKK6+V was acetylated on three residues in the activation loop (Ser-207, Lys-210, and Thr-211) and on one residue in the catalytic loop (Lys-172) (Fig. 4B) (13Ohren J.F. Chen H. Pavlovsky A. Whitehead C. Zhang E. Kuffa P. Yan C. McConnell P. Spessard C. Banotai C. Mueller W.T. Delaney A. Omer C. Sebolt-Leopold J. Dudley D.T. Leung I.K. Flamme C. Warmus J. Kaufman M. Barrett S. Tecle H. Hasemann C.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The three residues in the activation loop are the same three residues that are modified by YopJ, and as shown in Fig. 3A, the acetylation by VopA on the activation loop of the kinase directly competes with phosphorylation on the serine and threonine residues. The fourth residue is a conserved lysine that is involved in the coordination of the γ-phosphate of ATP upon nucleotide binding. To confirm that acetylation of the lysine residue on the catalytic loop can occur on an active kinase, we used the purified active phosphomimic, His6-MKK1(S218E,S222D), as a substrate in an acetylation assay (7Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.Q. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We were able to detect acetylation of His6-MKK1(S218E,S222D) by VopA but not VopA-C167A (Fig. 4C). We were also able to detect autoacetylation of VopA, which is not seen in the assay with rMKK6. This observed difference is likely because of the extended exposure required to see His6-MKK1(S218E,S222D) acetylation (1.5 weeks). The longer exposure time is required because only one acetylation site on His6-MKK1(S218E,S222D) is available for modification, due to the mutations of both serines on the activation loop and the lack of a lysine residue on the activation loop in MKK1. Acetylation of Lys-172 by VopA Disrupts ATP Binding to MKK—Based on the location of the conserved lysine in the kinase (Lys-172 in MKK6) and its interaction with the γ-phosphate of ATP, we hypothesized that acetylating this lysine would negatively affect the binding of ATP, but not ADP, to MKKs. Therefore, we analyzed the binding of the fluorescent nucleotide analogs MANT-ATP and MANT-ADP to constitutively activated His6-MKK1(S218E,S222D). When excited at 290 nm the MANT-labeled nucleotides, ATP and ADP, emit strong fluorescent peaks (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively) (14Aubol B.E. Nolen B. Shaffer J. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12813-12820Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). When MANT-ATP or MANT-ADP is incubated with either His6-MKK1(S218E,S222D) or His6-MKK1(S218E,S222D) that is preincubated with VopA-C167A, an increase in the emission maximum at ∼450 nm is observed (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). This is similar to the emission profile observed for binding of these nucleotide analogs to other kinases (14Aubol B.E. Nolen B. Shaffer J. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12813-12820Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, this increase in fluorescence in the presence of MANT-ATP is abrogated when His6-MKK1(S218E,S222D) is preincubated with wild type VopA (Fig. 5A). This inhibitory effect is not seen in the presence of MANT-ADP (Fig. 5B), although binding of both wild type VopA and VopA-C167A does increase the emission of MANT-ADP bound to His6-MKK1(S218E,S222D). We propose this difference be attributed to the disruption of the coordination of binding for the γ-phosphate of ATP by the acetylated lysine residue (Lys-192) in MKK1. VopA, a Multi-tasking Acetyltransferase—Vibrio VopA is an acetyltransferase that modifies MKKs on serine, threonine, and lysine. The modification of the lysine residue on the catalytic loop of the kinase is a novel mechanism for inhibiting a kinase. Essentially, VopA uses an acetyl group to nullify the charge on the lysine and destabilize interactions with the γ-phosphate of ATP. The modifications on serine and threonine residues in the active site loop prevent activation of the kinase by phosphorylation, similar to what has been observed before with Yersinia YopJ (9Mukherjee S. Keitany G. Li Y. Wang Y. Ball H.L. Goldsmith E.J. Orth K. Science. 2006; 312: 1211-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 10Mittal R. Peak-Chew S.Y. McMahon H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 18574-18579Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The lysine in the activation loop of the MKK6 is not conserved and, therefore, not thought to be important for the inhibitory activity of the effector (9Mukherjee S. Keitany G. Li Y. Wang Y. Ball H.L. Goldsmith E.J. Orth K. Science. 2006; 312: 1211-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Based on the architecture of their catalytic site, VopA and other YopJ-like proteins are predicted to transfer the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to a protein substrate using a ping-pong mechanism (8Mukherjee S. Hao Y.H. Orth K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 210-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For this mechanism, a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate is formed that is attacked by the R group of an amino acid. Supported by the presented experiments, VopA must efficiently coordinate two distinct nucleophiles for attack on the acetyl-enzyme intermediate: an amine from a lysine residue or a hydroxyl from a serine or threonine. Although the structure/function studies required to understand the biochemical mechanism used by these enzymes are beyond the scope of this study, from a molecular point of view the mechanism used by this group of enzymes is intriguing and will be interesting to decipher. VopA, an Ideal Molecular Inhibitor—For decades, scientists have been, and still are, trying to design specific inhibitors that target the nucleotide binding site of kinases. Attempts to make selective inhibitors, such as imatinib, have been focused on targeting the inactive state of a kinase because of its unique fold (15Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M.A. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In their active states many kinases conform to a canonical structure, which makes it difficult to target a specific kinase or even a family of kinases. Natural selection has once again proven to be the champion chemist by creating VopA. This bacterial effector disrupts not only the inactive form of the kinase but the active form as well. VopA efficiently inhibits the MKKs two ways by targeting different sites on the kinase. First, VopA targets the pharmacological “sweet spot” (i.e. the nucleotide binding site) of a kinase by masking the charge on a lysine residue with an acetyl moiety. This change in the charge and shape of the nucleotide binding pocket of a kinase drastically changes the activity of the enzyme. The modified kinase is no longer able to bind ATP but is still able to bind ADP. Therefore, acetylated MKKs are covalently locked into an inactive state and are no longer able to modify their substrates. VopA also targets the activation of the MKKs by acetylation of the activation loop on the serine and threonine residues, directly competing with phosphorylation, resulting in a kinase that cannot be activated. Perhaps it is understandable that VopA appears to be a more potent inhibitor of MAPK signaling than YopJ because VopA is able to inactivate MKKs by two mechanisms, whereas YopJ only uses one (11Trosky J.E. Mukherjee S. Burdette D.L. Roberts M. McCarter L. Siegel R.M. Orth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51953-51957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recently another effector, the Yersinia kinase YpkA, has been shown to block the binding of a GTP to G-protein Gαq.In contrast to VopA that modifies the nucleotide binding site with a neutral acetyl group, YpkA phosphorylates a serine residue found in the proximity of the GTP binding site (16Navarro L. Koller A. Nordfelth R. Wolf-Watz H. Taylor S. Dixon J.E. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 465-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-47 on Gαq is predicted to reduce its affinity for GTP, thereby inactivating the G-protein. The molecular mechanisms are quite distinct for these two effectors, but the global outcome is the same: they disrupt the binding of the nucleotide to a host enzyme. Diversity of Acetyltransferase Effector Family—Bacterial effectors, much like viral oncoproteins, target and manipulate host signaling by usurping or mimicking a host activity (4Orth K. Microbe (Wash., D. C.). 2007; 2: 183-186Google Scholar, 5Viboud G.I. Bliska J.B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The bacterial effectors contain a variety of enzymatic activities that includes hydrolases, phosphatases, GTPase-activating proteins, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and kinases (4Orth K. Microbe (Wash., D. C.). 2007; 2: 183-186Google Scholar, 5Viboud G.I. Bliska J.B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 17Navarro L. Alto N.M. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently, another enzyme, a serine/threonine acetyltransferase, was observed, and now we find lysine acetylation is used to manipulate host signaling 8-10, 18. Some of these effectors, like VopA, belong to a large family of effectors that are expressed by a variety of pathogens (11Trosky J.E. Mukherjee S. Burdette D.L. Roberts M. McCarter L. Siegel R.M. Orth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51953-51957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 19Staskawicz B.J. Mudgett M.B. Dangl J.L. Galan J.E. Science. 2001; 292: 2285-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These families are arranged by the homology found in their primary amino acid sequence. As with other families of enzymes, the molecular activity of a bacterial effector can be predicted based on the biochemical activity of one or more of the family members. Proving an effector has the predicted activity requires direct biochemical experiments. Even though the substrates of many eukaryotic enzymes can be predicted because of the conservative nature of signaling pathways throughout evolution, the identification of substrate for bacterial effectors is challenging to say the least. These enzymes have been mutated and molded over time to contain an activity that is custom designed by the pathogen that expresses it. For example, Yersinia YopJ cripples the innate immune response by inhibiting all MAPK pathways and the NFκB pathway, whereas Vibrio VopA targets only MAPK pathways, albeit in a more potent manner (7Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.Q. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 11Trosky J.E. Mukherjee S. Burdette D.L. Roberts M. McCarter L. Siegel R.M. Orth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51953-51957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Homologues of these acetyltransferases are expressed by Rhizobium, a plant symbiont that may use this activity to attenuate host-signaling pathways to facilitate a commensal relationship between the bacteria and host (5Viboud G.I. Bliska J.B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 69-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 7Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.Q. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Plant pathogens seem to be the most aggressive with regard to this family of effectors because some of the bacteria that target plants contain over a half-dozen genes encoding YopJ-like effectors (20Altschul S.F.

Modifying a protein with lysine acetylation is a reasonable way to regulate the nucleotide binding to a kinase because lysine acetylation, like phosphorylation, is reversible. We propose that VopA exemplifies an effector that usurped the eukaryotic activity of lysine acetylation. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that expression of VopA in yeast suspends cell growth, but the growth suppression can be reversed when expression of VopA is stopped. In addition, these observations support by inference that O-acetylation (serine and threonine acetylation), like N-acetylation (lysine acetylation), will be reversible. Therefore, serine, threonine, and lysine acetylation might be reversible post-translational modifications that are used to modulate the enzymatic activity of eukaryotic signaling machinery.

https://openalex.org/W2143125861,"The neural basis of spatial processing in the auditory cortex has been controversial. Human fMRI studies suggest that a part of the planum temporale (PT) is involved in auditory spatial processing, but it was recently argued that this region is active only when the task requires voluntary spatial localization. If this is the case, then this region cannot harbor an ongoing spatial representation of the acoustic environment. In contrast, we show in three fMRI experiments that a region in the human medial PT is sensitive to background auditory spatial changes, even when subjects are not engaged in a spatial localization task, and in fact attend the visual modality. During such times, this area responded to rare location shifts, and even more so when spatial variation increased, consistent with spatially selective adaptation. Thus, acoustic space is represented in the human PT even when sound processing is not required by the ongoing task."
https://openalex.org/W2011837636,"We show that when a moving object suddenly reverses direction, there is a brief, synchronous burst of firing within a population of retinal ganglion cells. This burst can be driven by either the leading or trailing edge of the object. The latency is constant for movement at different speeds, objects of different size, and bright versus dark contrasts. The same ganglion cells that signal a motion reversal also respond to smooth motion. We show that the brain can build a pure reversal detector using only a linear filter that reads out synchrony from a group of ganglion cells.

We show that the reversal response cannot be explained by models of the classical receptive field and suggest that nonlinear receptive field subunits may be responsible. In order to initiate coordinated movements, the brain must compensate for both delays in the responses of neurons and delays in the movement of limbs to their intended targets. In principle, the only way to compensate for these delays is to use the past trajectory of an object's motion to make predictions about its future location. Such predictions are commonplace in everyday life, and even more salient examples come from athletics, such as a batter hitting a baseball or a wide receiver acrobatically catching a pass. Evidence of motion extrapolation exists for a variety of tasks: a batter tracking a fast-moving pitch (De Lucia and Cochran, 1985De Lucia P.R. Cochran E.L.

Previous work has even shown that the retina makes a contribution to predicting the location of a moving object (Berry et al., 1999Berry II, M.J. Brivanlou I.H. Jordan T.A. Meister M. Anticipation of moving stimuli by the retina.Nature. 1999; 398: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). What happens, though, when the trajectory of a moving object suddenly changes in an unpredictable fashion? In sports, this leads to errors in motor coordination, such as a batter's swing missing a curveball when a fastball was expected, or a football player bobbling a fumbled football despite its slow movement. During smooth pursuit, sudden deviations in the trajectory lead to pursuit errors, and large localization errors often trigger catch-up saccades (Carpenter, 1988Carpenter R.H.S. Movements of the Eyes. Pion, London1988Google Scholar, Krauzlis and Lisberger, 1994Krauzlis R.J. Lisberger S.G.

The mechanics of human smooth pursuit eye movement.J. Physiol. 1965; 180: 569-591PubMed Google Scholar). One of the most profound motion discontinuities is a reversal of direction, which makes any previous extrapolation of the object's trajectory misleading. Motion reversal has long been known to evoke a characteristic change in EEG recordings from human subjects (Clarke, 1972Clarke P.G. Visual evoked potentials to sudden reversal of the motion of a pattern.Brain Res. 1972; 36: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, MacKay and Rietveld, 1968MacKay D.M. Rietveld W.J. Electroencephalogram potentials evoked by accelerated visual motion.Nature. 1968; 217: 677-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These visually evoked potentials show peaks at 135–170 ms and ∼260 ms after a reversal, and their source has been localized to the MT+ region of human cortex (Ahlfors et al., 1999Ahlfors S.P. Simpson G.V. Dale A.M. Belliveau J.W. Liu A.K. Korvenoja A. Virtanen J. Huotilainen M. Tootell R.B. Aronen H.J. Ilmoniemi R.J. Spatiotemporal activity of a cortical network for processing visual motion revealed by MEG and fMRI.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 2545-2555PubMed Google Scholar). One experiment in monkeys suggested that single cells in areas MT and LIP might respond to motion reversals (Maimon and Assad, 2006Maimon G. Assad J.A. A cognitive signal for the proactive timing of action in macaque LIP.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, there has been no evidence of a specific response to motion reversal in earlier cortex, let alone subcortical structures. Here, we show that motion reversal triggers an extra burst of firing in retinal ganglion cells. This firing occurs with a constant latency (∼250 ms in salamander, ∼190 ms in mouse), regardless of cell type or the location of the object in a cell's receptive field. As a result, the reversal evokes synchronized firing from a large population of ganglion cells, and this synchrony can uniquely distinguish the firing event from the response of the same cells to smooth motion. We suggest that this synchronized burst signals a violation in the retina's ongoing motion prediction. Such an error signal could be used by the brain to redirect attention or to reset central mechanisms of motion extrapolation. We also find that the synchronized burst of firing helps the retinal representation of a moving object's location rapidly catch up to the object's true position. This acceleration is a consequence of the retinal representation switching from one edge of the object to the other after the reversal. We used a multielectrode array to record spikes extracellularly from retinal ganglion cells in salamander and mouse (Segev et al., 2004Segev R. Goodhouse J. Puchalla J. Berry 2nd, M.J. Recording spikes from a large fraction of the ganglion cells in a retinal patch.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1154-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) while presenting a variety of moving objects as stimuli (see Experimental Procedures). A moving bar (110 μm wide, traveling at 1.32 mm/s) evoked a strong, temporally distributed response as it moved through a ganglion cell's receptive field (Figure 1, top). However, when the bar reversed direction near the cell's receptive field (pictogram to the right), an additional sharp peak of firing was observed (Figure 1, bottom). While the cell's initial, distributed response was timed to the arrival of the bar on the receptive field center (solid arrowheads), the sharp burst of firing following the reversal was not timed to the reentry of the bar on the receptive field center (gray arrowheads). Rather, the response occurred at a fixed latency (∼250 ms in salamander, ∼190 ms in mouse) after the bar reversed, regardless of reversal position. We therefore conclude that this response was triggered by the reversal itself. This response was seen in a large proportion of cells in both species (salamander: 278/745 = 37%; mouse: 17/39 = 43%). Many cells, especially those in the mouse, also fired spikes when the bar moved out of the surround (asterisk). The strength of this “shift effect” varied considerably within the population and did not correlate with the response to motion reversal (Barlow et al., 1977Barlow H.B. Derrington A.M. Harris L.R. Lennie P. The effects of remote retinal stimulation on the responses of cat retinal ganglion cells.J. Physiol. 1977; 269: 177-194PubMed Google Scholar, McIlwain, 1966McIlwain J.T. Some evidence concerning the physiological basis of the periphery effect in the cat's retina.Exp. Brain Res. 1966; 1: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The reversal response appeared at a fixed latency not only for different reversal positions around a single cell, but also across different cells. Figure 2 shows spike time rasters for five cells in salamander and six in mouse responding to a bar reversing at one position (see pictograms). Because each cell had a different receptive field center location, the initial response began at a different time. However, the reversal response was synchronized across all cells. The synchrony was even more apparent in the entire population (Figures 2C and 2D). When we aligned responses to the reversal time and calculated the average firing rate for a set of cells responding to different reversal locations, the distribution of initial firing due to the bar entering the receptive field was smeared, but the reversal response remained a sharp peak. Even large changes in the stimulus parameters failed to change the latency of the reversal response. Reversing bars of opposite contrast, varying widths, and different speeds all elicited a response peaked at roughly the same latency (Figures 2E and 2F). We next studied how the strength of the reversal response depended on the location at which the bar reversed on a cell's receptive field. When we measured the location of the bar's leading edge at the time of reversal, we found that reversals occurring before the cell's center coordinate had a strength that roughly followed the spatial profile of the receptive field center. However, reversals occurring beyond the center coordinate elicited responses from up to four center radii away (Figure 3A, left). The observation that both light and dark bars could trigger a reversal response in the same ganglion cell made us wonder if both the leading and trailing edge of the bar could drive firing after a motion reversal. If we instead considered the position of the bar's trailing edge, we found that responses for reversals beyond the center coincided with the spatial profile of the center (Figure 3A, right). We investigated this effect further by using wider moving bars. Considered individually, many ganglion cells had a reversal response whose strength peaked around two different locations, corresponding to reversals of the leading and trailing edges. Figure 3B shows a cell with a peak in its firing rate at a fixed latency of ∼250 ms after the reversal. This reversal response was elicited by the leading edge (top four traces) or trailing edge (bottom two traces), but no response occurred for reversals at intermediate positions. We repeated the analysis of Figure 3A for wider bars (220 and 440 μm) and found the same asymmetry in the strength of the reversal response as function of the position of the leading edge at the time of reversal. However, when a single-contrast edge reversed its direction of motion, the strength of the reversal response corresponded well with the spatial profile of the receptive field center (Figure 3C). We also probed the retina with moving squares instead of extended bars. Motion reversal of a square object triggered a synchronous burst of firing in the ganglion cell population, just as for a reversing bar (Figure 4A). Because a square has a limited extent in the direction perpendicular to its motion, some reversals occurred in the surround above or below the center. These motion reversals did not trigger any firing (Figure 4B). For some reversal locations, the entire square was contained within the receptive field center and still triggered a burst of firing, indicating that stimulation of the surround is not necessary for a reversal response. Together, these observations suggest that synchronized firing can be generated when either the leading or trailing edge of a moving object reverses direction on the receptive field center but not on the surround. Since the ganglion cells that respond to a reversing bar are not a small, specialized class, but rather a large fraction of the entire population, the brain faces a serious challenge in interpreting this message. Most spikes from one of these cells signal the smooth motion of an object across the cell's receptive field, while other spikes from the same cell have a very different meaning: an object has reversed direction. This ambiguity must be resolved by looking at the population of ganglion cells. With this idea in mind, we constructed a decoder which used the spikes from a group of cells to distinguish reversals from smooth motion. We can think of the decoder as a “reversal-detector” cell in a subsequent neural circuit, which receives input from many retinal ganglion cells. We model this detector with a linear filter f(t) that acts on all input spikes {ti}, and a threshold, θ. Whenever the contribution summed over all inputs exceeds the thresholdu(t)=∑if(t−ti)≥θ,the detector decides that a reversal has occurred. After computing the optimal filter from the data (see Experimental Procedures), we evaluated the performance of the decoder by detecting reversals in single-trial spike trains (Figure 5). We randomly selected many groups out of 31 cells recorded in one experiment, and applied the filter to all the spikes in the ganglion cell population for 120 trials each of smooth motion and motion reversals. Different values of the threshold θ result in a tradeoff between more misses versus more false alarms; we chose many values of θ and quantified the total error using the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (Green and Swets, 1966Green D.M. Swets J.A. Signal Detection Theory and Psychophysics. Wiley, New York1966Google Scholar). Performance depended strongly on the spatial separation of ganglion cell receptive fields in each group (Figure 5D). This effect occurs because reversal synchrony was easier to detect when smooth motion triggered the cells to fire at different times. For widely separated groups of 16 ganglion cells, the total error rate was 4.2%. Can this simple decoder achieve even better performance with more cells? Because reversals anywhere up to two radii beyond the center coordinate in either the horizontal or vertical direction can trigger a burst of firing, we estimate that over 275 cells are available to the decoder and at least 100 of them have significant reversal responses (see Experimental Procedures). To explore the performance possible with larger populations, we pooled over reversal locations, treating data from the same cell recorded at multiple reversal locations as multiple cells with receptive fields at different distances from point of reversal. Using 71 such cells with reversal responses, the decoder achieved 100% correct detection on all 120 reversal trials and 0% false alarms on all 240 nonreversal trials. While this analysis does not demonstrate that the brain actually does identify reversals in this manner, such identification is clearly possible using a biologically plausible mechanism and pooling over a realistic number of retinal ganglion cells. Excellent detection is made possible not just by the synchrony of ganglion cell firing, but also by its temporal profile. If instead of filtering the spike trains with f(t), we merely used the spike count in a single time window, the performance was very poor. For time windows between 5 and 40 ms, the spike count following the reversal exceeded all other time bins in no more than 26% of the trials. This means that error rates lower than 50% are not possible with a decoder that simply counts spikes in a single time window. The typical response of a ganglion cell involves initial firing due to smooth motion, followed by a pause, and then a sharp burst. The decoder's temporal filter has a shape resembling a second-derivative in time, which matches well to this temporal profile of ganglion cell firing. Of course, it may be possible to recognize a motion reversal using the pattern of cells that fire together in a small time window rather than just the total number of cells by performing a nonlinear operation on retinal spike trains, although such a decoding mechanism would be more biophysically elaborate than the form we propose. We can gain more insight into the manner in which the retina tracks a moving object that reverses direction by considering the “neural image” of ganglion cell activity. The neural image is the spatial pattern of firing in the ganglion cell population as a function of time (Berry et al., 1999Berry II, M.J. Brivanlou I.H. Jordan T.A. Meister M. Anticipation of moving stimuli by the retina.Nature. 1999; 398: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We calculated the neural image for each point in time by first plotting the (normalized) firing rate of all the recorded ganglion cells as a function of the distance between the location of the moving bar and the cell's receptive field center coordinate (Figure 6A). Because we only recorded from a small fraction of all of the ganglion cells that respond to the bar's motion, we included data taken from the same cells at multiple reversal locations. These data were then smoothed to make our best estimate of the spatial pattern of activity in the larger population of ganglion cells (see Experimental Procedures). Long before motion reversal, the neural image travels along with the moving bar, despite the response latency of ganglion cells (Figure 6B). This spatial shift in the neural image results from motion anticipation, which is a simple form of prediction that the retina makes about the future location of a smoothly moving object (Berry et al., 1999Berry II, M.J. Brivanlou I.H. Jordan T.A. Meister M. Anticipation of moving stimuli by the retina.Nature. 1999; 398: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Immediately after the reversal, the neural image overshoots the reversal location. This is a manifestation of the predictive nature of retinal motion processing: because of its response delay, the retina does not yet know that a reversal has occurred and its previous anticipation of the object's location still operates. When information about the reversal becomes available, 100 ms later, the retinal response drops off. Then, at 250 ms after the reversal, the sharp, synchronous burst of firing occurs. Interestingly, the neural image rapidly accelerates in the new direction of motion at this time, nearly catching up to the bar's location. Retinal firing then briefly drops off, and finally, at 400 ms after the reversal, a smooth motion response emerges with correct anticipation of the bar's location. Again, the long delay before correct anticipation emerges is consistent with the interpretation that anticipation is a form of prediction that requires extensive integration over the object's past trajectory. Why does the neural image catch up at the time of the synchronous burst of firing? This can be seen as a consequence of the spatial asymmetry of reversal locations that drive a response (Figure 3). When the leading edge of an object moves over a ganglion cell but the trailing edge is still within the receptive field center, the cell participates in the synchronous burst of firing. However, when the leading edge of an object reverses before it has reached the receptive field center, the cell does not fire. Therefore, when an object reverses, ganglion cells far away in the new direction of motion will fire but those far away in the old direction of motion will not fire. As a result, the neural image is significantly shifted in the new direction of motion, helping to catch up to the object's location. Another way of looking at the same data is to observe that during smooth motion, contrast gain control tends to localize ganglion cell firing near the leading edge of the object (Berry et al., 1999Berry II, M.J. Brivanlou I.H. Jordan T.A. Meister M. Anticipation of moving stimuli by the retina.Nature. 1999; 398: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). But then, the reversal response can be triggered by either the leading or trailing edge. Thus, it helps to switch the location of the neural image to what will be the new leading edge of the object when it is moving in the other direction. Next, we asked whether this synchronized retinal response is unique to motion reversals or whether the retina conveys a more general signal of motion acceleration. To explore this question, we tested several other kinds of motion discontinuity. For both moderate acceleration and deceleration in the same direction of motion, there was no extra burst of firing (Figure 7A), nor was there any extra firing for an object that abruptly stopped its motion (Figure 7B, middle). These data indicate that the response is not a generic signal of acceleration or motion discontinuity. However, when a stationary object suddenly began moving, there was a synchronized burst of firing in the retinal population (Figure 7B, lower). While this firing pattern resembles the response to motion reversal, there are several salient differences: the latency is much shorter (140 versus 260 ms), the peak firing rate is roughly twice as large, and the latency depends systematically on the speed (data not shown). Furthermore, different sets of ganglion cells exhibit responses to motion onset and motion reversal. These facts suggest that different circuit mechanisms may be responsible for the response to motion onset, although a more unified picture may emerge from further studies. We also found that bars that moved at a constant velocity and crossed elicited a response that was nearly identical to that for a reversing bar (Figure 7C). So, a synchronized burst of firing is not unique to motion reversal. However, the synchronized firing patterns elicited by both motion onset and crossing motion possess important differences that distinguish them from the reversal response (see below). In order to gain greater insight about the reversal response, we asked whether the spatiotemporal dynamics of a ganglion cell's receptive field could account for the phenomenon. Previous work has shown that ganglion cell responses to a smoothly moving bar are well predicted by a linear-nonlinear (LN) model with gain control (Berry et al., 1999Berry II, M.J. Brivanlou I.H. Jordan T.A. Meister M. Anticipation of moving stimuli by the retina.Nature. 1999; 398: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, Shapley and Victor, 1981Shapley R.M. Victor J.D. How the contrast gain control modifies the frequency responses of cat retinal ganglion cells.J. Physiol. 1981; 318: 161-179PubMed Google Scholar). The linear part of the model describes the basic spatial and temporal filtering of the receptive field through a convolution operation (Rodieck and Stone, 1965Rodieck R.W. Stone J. Response of cat retinal ganglion cells to moving visual patterns.J. Neurophysiol. 1965; 28: 819-832PubMed Google Scholar). A nonlinearity then truncates negative values to produce a firing rate as a function of time. Adding gain control to this model enables it to mimic the ability of ganglion cells to anticipate the leading edge of a moving bar (Berry et al., 1999Berry II, M.J. Brivanlou I.H. Jordan T.A. Meister M. Anticipation of moving stimuli by the retina.Nature. 1999; 398: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). For each cell, the model was fit to firing rate traces for a bar which reversed far enough away from the receptive field center such that each pass of the bar elicited its own smooth motion response (Figure 8A, lower). The same parameters were used for all other reversal locations (see legend). The model provided a good fit for responses to smooth motion, but failed to predict the reversal response for any reversal position (Figure 8B). The failure of the LN model lies in the initial spatiotemporal filtering, as this convolution often had a negative or zero value at the peak of the reversal response (Figure 8B). Across the population (n = 85 cells at 267 total reversal positions), the convolution value at the time of the reversal peak varied widely and on average was not significantly different than zero (p = 0.87). This analysis indicates that more sophisticated models of receptive field dynamics are needed to explain the reversal response (see below). We have found that an abrupt reversal of motion evokes an extra burst of firing in a large fraction of all retinal ganglion cells in the salamander and mouse. This firing occurs with the same latency when either the leading or trailing edge of an object reverses on a cell's receptive field. Because the latency is constant for all cells and all reversal locations, and because either edge can drive a response, motion reversal evokes a synchronous burst of firing in a population of roughly 100 ganglion cells. To our knowledge, this mode of firing has not previously been described. As shown in Figure 8, the reversal response cannot be explained by models of the classical receptive field, even if they include gain control. However, the reversal response embodies several kinds of invariance to properties of the moving object, such as polarity, size, and speed. These invariances are not only useful for the neural code, but also have implications for the circuit mechanisms responsible. The fact that both bright and dark objects can evoke a reversal response suggests that the retinal interneurons involved in this processing have ON-OFF response characteristics, as has been described in many types of amacrine cells (Miller et al., 2006Miller R.F.

https://openalex.org/W2074078843,"Fli1, a member of Ets transcriptional factors, has been shown to be a negative regulator of collagen gene expression in dermal fibroblasts. Although Fli1 down-regulation is implicated in pathological matrix remodeling such as cutaneous fibrosis in scleroderma, very little is known about the post-translational mechanisms regulating Fli1 function. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of acetylation, one of the main post-translational regulatory mechanisms, in regulating Fli1 activity. We initially demonstrated that Fli1 is acetylated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 in dermal fibroblasts. An in vivo acetylation assay using 293T cells revealed that Fli1 is mainly acetylated by the histone acetyltransferase activity of p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) at lysine 380. Acetylation of Fli1 resulted in a decreased stability of Fli1 protein. More importantly, reduced binding of acetylated Fli1 to the human α2(I) collagen (COL1A2) promoter was observed in DNA affinity precipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Conversely, a Fli1 K380R mutant that is resistant to acetylation by PCAF showed increased DNA binding ability. Furthermore, PCAF overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of Fli1 on TGF-β1-mediated COL1A2 promoter activity. In contrast, the Fli1 K380R mutant had a greater inhibitory effect on TGF-β1-induced COL1A2 promoter activity than wild-type Fli1, and PCAF failed to reverse this effect. These results indicate that PCAF-dependent acetylation of lysine 380 abrogates repressor function of Fli1 with respect to collagen gene expression. Furthermore, these data strongly suggest that the TGF-β-dependent acetylation of Fli1 may represent the principal mechanism responsible for the TGF-β-induced dissociation of Fli1 from the collagen promoter."

Archaeal MCM proteins also display enhanced unwinding of a forked DNA substrate (18Carpentieri F. De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol.

Herein, we report on the mechanism of DNA binding and substrate selectivity of Sulfolobus solfataricus MCM (SsoMCM) obtained through single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) studies. smFRET (31Ha T. Enderle T. Ogletree D.F. Chemla D.S. Selvin P.R. Weiss S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6264-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 32Ha T. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) is a powerful method able to unravel biological events, including helicase activities, without ensemble averaging. smFRET was applied to probe the binding and orientation of MCM on DNA as well as the conformational changes induced in DNA upon MCM loading. MCM demonstrates a specificity of binding to forked DNA over single-tailed and duplex substrates. This results from a highly dynamic interaction between the 5′-tail and MCM, with a mechanistic implication on replicative helicases. DNA Substrates and Annealing—Oligonucleotide substrates were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Forked, partial, and duplex substrates were prepared by mixing the biotinylated and non-biotinylated strands in a 1:1.5 ratio at 1 μm in buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8) and 200 mm NaCl. The non-biotinylated strand was added in excess to minimize the chance of having residual biotinylated strand in the measurement. The annealing mixture was heated at 95 °C for 2 min and allowed to cool slowly for 2 h in the heating block. (For substrates and sequences, see supplemental “Experimental Procedures.”) Protein Purification and Protein Labeling—Wild-type SsoMCM and its C642A mutant were purified as described previously (10McGeoch A.T. Trakselis M.A. Laskey R.A. Bell S.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Cy3 and Cy5 N-hydroxysuccinimide esters and maleimides were purchased from GE Healthcare. Fluorescence labeling of SsoMCM was also performed as described previously (10McGeoch A.T. Trakselis M.A. Laskey R.A. Bell S.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild-type SsoMCM was incubated with the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester in 25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 at pH 6.8 and then quenched with 10 mm Tris after 1 h (referred to as N-MCM). C642A mutant SsoMCM was incubated with the maleimide in the same buffer at pH 7.5 and then quenched with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol after 4 h (referred to as C-MCM). Labeled MCM proteins were spun through a spin column and dialyzed extensively to remove any remaining free label. The degree of labeling was determined by UV spectrometry using the appropriate extinction coefficients and found to be essentially 1 for all cases. Single Molecule Spectroscopy—smFRET measurements were performed using a wide-field total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (33Zhuang X.W. Bartley L.E. Babcock H.P. Russell R. Ha T.J. Herschlag D. Chu S. Science. 2000; 288: 2048-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 34Ha T. Rasnik I. Cheng W. Babcock H.P. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Chu S. Nature. 2002; 419: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Total internal reflection excitation was done either using a prism or through an objective (Olympus UPlanSApo ×100 numerical aperture 1.4 oil). Images were acquired with a 30-ms time resolution using an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera (iXon DV887-BI, Andor Technology) and a homemade C++ program. FRET values were calculated as the ratio between the acceptor intensity and the sum of the intensities of the donor and acceptor, after correcting for cross-talk between the two detection channels and subtracting the background (32Ha T. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 35Rasnik I. Myong S. Cheng W. Lohman T.M. Ha T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A quartz slide was coated with polyethylene glycol, with 1-2% (w/w) biotin-polyethylene glycol (34Ha T. Rasnik I. Cheng W. Babcock H.P. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Chu S. Nature. 2002; 419: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 35Rasnik I. Myong S. Cheng W. Lohman T.M. Ha T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Surface integrity and nonspecific binding were tested by separately adding Cy3-labeled protein (4 μm) and DNA (1 nm). Once surface integrity was verified, NeutrAvidin was added as described (32Ha T. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 35Rasnik I. Myong S. Cheng W. Lohman T.M. Ha T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), followed by immobilizing biotinylated DNA (150 pm). All measurements were performed at room temperature with buffer 4 from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA), which contains 50 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.9). The buffer also contained 0.8% glucose with an oxygen scavenger system (0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.02 mg/ml catalase, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.4% (w/w) β-d-glucose) (32Ha T. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 35Rasnik I. Myong S. Cheng W. Lohman T.M. Ha T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Single Molecule Measurements of Labeled MCM Complex—To reduce the possibility of FRET between one-donor DNA and an MCM hexamer labeled with multiple acceptors, wild-type MCM was mixed with labeled MCM to yield a final labeled/unlabeled monomer ratio of 1:8. Labeled and unlabeled MCM proteins were incubated in the dark for at least 1 h at room temperature. Surface-attached DNA molecules were incubated with the reported concentrations of MCM (all given in monomer concentration) for 5 min, ensuring sufficient time for binding. Excess and unbound MCM was removed by a wash with buffer 4, followed by a wash with imaging buffer. smFRET Analysis of SsoMCM Fork Binding Orientation—SsoMCM contains several functional domains with separable domain-dependent activities. The C-terminal half contains the AAA+ (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) domain and a helix-turn-helix motif, and the N terminus includes the Walker A and B motifs (10McGeoch A.T. Trakselis M.A. Laskey R.A. Bell S.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recent studies of truncated SsoMCM complexes assigned the helicase activity to the C-terminal half and showed that the N-terminal half governs substrate selectivity and enzyme processivity (36Barry E.R. McGeoch A.T. Kelman Z. Bell S.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 988-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For smFRET measurements, Cy3 was used as the donor and Cy5 as the acceptor. For DNA-to-MCM FRET analysis, MCM was labeled with Cy5 at the N terminus (N-MCM) or C terminus (C-MCM), and the various DNA substrates were labeled with Cy3. The activity of purified and labeled MCM was verified prior to measurements as described (10McGeoch A.T. Trakselis M.A. Laskey R.A. Bell S.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The DNA molecules were attached to the surface of a flow chamber and incubated with MCM at a specified monomer concentration, followed by an extensive wash to remove unbound MCM (see “Experimental procedures”). The orientation of MCM was measured via the binding of acceptor-labeled C-MCM or N-MCM (8 μm pre-wash monomer concentration) to forked DNA substrates that were donor-labeled at either the 3′-end or the junction. The normalized relative distance distributions, extracted from smFRET efficiency histograms, are shown for four different combinations: N terminus to 3′-end, C terminus to 3′-end, C terminus to junction, and N terminus to junction (Fig. 1, A-D, respectively). The data indicate that the N terminus is closer to the 3′-end (∼5.4 nm) than to the junction (>8.2 nm). The distances were calculated using the previously determined value of ∼6.3 nm for the Cy3-Cy5 pair (35Rasnik I. Myong S. Cheng W. Lohman T.M. Ha T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and should be considered only as an approximation because of the relatively large fluorescence anisotropy of the protein- and DNA-conjugated fluorophores. Additionally, the C terminus is closer to the junction (∼7.0 nm) than to the N terminus (>8.2 nm). In combination, our data indicate the MCM orientation illustrated in Fig. 1; MCM binds to the 3′-tail with the C-terminal AAA+ helicase domain facing the junction and the N-terminal domain, which includes the substrate selectivity domain, closer to the 3′-end. These findings are in agreement with the previously reported organization of MCM on DNA (10McGeoch A.T. Trakselis M.A. Laskey R.A. Bell S.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) as measured in ensemble experiments, validating our smFRET assays. SsoMCM Substrate Binding Specificity—We next aimed to probe the substrate binding preference of MCM. The fluorescence of surface-tethered donor-labeled DNA, either forked or with a 3′-tail (Fig. 2B), was measured after incubation with 3 μm acceptor-labeled C-MCM. Fig. 2A shows donor (panel I) and acceptor (panel II) single molecule fluorescence images of MCM bound to forked DNA (panel I) and the single 3′-tailed partial duplex (panel II). The fraction of DNA bound by MCM was determined from the resulting smFRET histograms (see supplemental “Experimental Procedures”). MCM displayed a nearly 2-fold enhanced binding to forked DNA substrate over the 3′-tailed partial duplex substrates (Fig. 2B). We considered the following three explanations at to why MCM prefers a forked DNA: 1) MCM loads on the free 3′-tail while externally grabbing the 5′-tail, possibly through surface binding modes; 2) MCM preferentially encircles both the 3′- and 5′-tails in its central channel; and 3) as proposed previously for MCM (37Takahashi T.S. Wigley D.B. Walter J.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), two hexamers are arranged in an eccentrically stacked double hexamer and bind separately to the 3′- and 5′-tails, each with its own polarity such that binding is improved when both tails are present. To distinguish among these binding modes, we determined the efficiency of binding of MCM to other substrates. Five different donor-labeled substrates were measured: an 18-bp full duplex, a 5′-tailed partial duplex, and three forked substrates labeled in different locations (Fig. 2C). Binding efficiency was low for the full duplex and 5′-tailed duplex substrates and was significantly higher for the forked substrates (Fig. 2C). The low binding of MCM to duplex substrates disfavors the second loading mechanism. Hence, the observed MCM preferred loading on forked substrates may be either due to external binding of the 5′-tail or through a double hexamer binding both strands. To further probe the loading mechanism, we designed three forked substrates labeled with a donor and an acceptor on opposing tails (Fig. 3), enabling us to investigate the behavior of the forked tails upon MCM loading. The DNA substrates were tethered to the surface, and unlabeled MCM at the indicated concentration was added (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 3A shows the smFRET efficiency histograms of a forked DNA substrate with a donor at the 3′-tail end and an acceptor at the 5′-tail end as a function of MCM concentration. DNA showed only low FRET efficiency values (Fig. 3A, upper panel) because of a large separation of flexible ssDNA. With increasing MCM concentrations, higher FRET efficiency populations emerged, indicating that the 3′- and 5′-tails are being brought closer together. This effect was also observed with two other forked substrates with similarly labeled 5′-tails, but with longer and internally labeled 3′-tails (Fig. 3, B and C). The existence of a high FRET efficiency population even at an MCM concentration as low as 150 nm is indicative of a single MCM hexamer bound on the forked substrates, not double hexamers, because previous stoichiometric analyses showed that SsoMCM assembles on a forked DNA only as a hexamer at concentrations up to 5 μm (10McGeoch A.T. Trakselis M.A. Laskey R.A. Bell S.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Carpentieri F. De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12118-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, double hexamer loading would yield low FRET because the DNA tails would be spatially separated by the proteins. These results led us to propose that the 3′-tail of the forked DNA substrate is accommodated in the central channel of the MCM hexamer, whereas the DNA 5′-tail binds externally (Fig. 3D). MCM Fork Binding and Interactions with the Opposite Strand—We next examined the dynamic nature of MCM binding to the forked DNA. To test the stability of the DNA-MCM complex, forked DNA (Fig. 3, substrate 1) was incubated with 4 μm MCM, washed, and monitored for >1 h (supplemental Fig. 1). No significant dissociation of MCM from the DNA was observed, ensuring that our measurements were not influenced by protein dissociation. Individual DNA molecules bound by MCM displayed temporal fluctuations in FRET efficiency in the absence of free MCM in solution (Fig. 4A, panel I), likely representing distance changes between the two ends of the forked substrate. Such continual fluctuation in distance with no apparent regularity was observed for the majority of molecules with all three forked substrates (81, 82, and 74% for substrates 1-3, respectively, in Fig. 3) and was still detected after ATP was added (supplemental Fig. 2). Similar behavior was observed for FRET efficiency between the donor at the 5′-tail and the acceptor at the N terminus of MCM (Fig. 4A, panel II), indicating a dynamic interaction of the 5′-tail with MCM. Furthermore, such complex interaction with MCM is unique to the 5′-tail, as we did not observe similar fluctuations in FRET between a donor at the 3′-tail and an acceptor on MCM. To further analyze this phenomenon, having no apparent regular fluctuation period or amplitude, we applied an autocorrelation analysis, in which, by self-correlating the values of a FRET efficiency time trace at different time periods, the characteristic relaxation times and behaviors can be extracted (see supplemental “Experimental Procedures”). The autocorrelation functions of individual smFRET traces were calculated and averaged over many molecules, ranging from 20 to 100 molecules for each experiment, to extract the characteristic time scales (Fig. 4B). Both the MCM-induced tail/tail interactions (Fig. 4B, panels I-III) and the 5′-tail/MCM interaction (panel IV) yielded average autocorrelation functions of similar shapes and times scales. The autocorrelation fitted poorly with an exponential decay function (Fig. 4B, panel I, blue curve), whereas a stretched exponential type function (Fig. 4B, red curves), modeled previously for subdiffusion phenomena (38Yang H. Xie X.S. J. Chem. Phys. 2002; 117: 10965-10979Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 39Metzler R. Barkai E. Klafter J. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1999; 82: 3563-3567Crossref Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 40Metzler R. Klafter J. Phys. Rep. Rev. Sec. Phys. Lett. 2000; 339: 1-77Crossref Scopus (6393) Google Scholar), provided a good fit. The relaxation time was in the second range but with stretch coefficients of ∼0.5, indicating a wide range of time scales for the dynamics, ranging from 60 ms to 5 s (Fig. 4B and supplemental “Experimental Procedures”). Subdiffusion is an anomalous diffusion phenomenon in which the mean square displacement has sublinear dependence on time, in contrast to regular diffusion with linear dependence on time (38Yang H. Xie X.S. J. Chem. Phys. 2002; 117: 10965-10979Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 40Metzler R. Klafter J. Phys. Rep. Rev. Sec. Phys. Lett. 2000; 339: 1-77Crossref Scopus (6393) Google Scholar, 41Yang H. Luo G.B. Karnchanaphanurach P. Louie T.M. Rech I. Cova S. Xun L.Y. Xie X.S. Science. 2003; 302: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Our analysis therefore indicates that the interaction between the 5′-tail and MCM surface can occur in many conformational states, each with a unique trapping and relaxation time, resulting in an interaction governed by subdiffusion kinetics. Using smFRET, we found that MCM possesses specificity for forked DNA substrates over single-tailed and duplex substrates. Furthermore, MCM loads on the forked DNA 3′-tail, with its C terminus facing the junction and N terminus toward the 3′-end, and externally binds to the 5′-tail. Previous ensemble FRET analysis of SsoMCM deduced the same binding orientation; however, a recent crystal structure of another hexameric AAA+ helicase, papillomavirus E1, shows binding to an ssDNA with opposite polarity (42Enemark E.J. Joshua-Tor L. Nature. 2006; 442: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Our smFRET result further supports the apparent difference in DNA binding polarity between SsoMCM and papillomavirus E1. The interaction between the 3′-tail-bound MCM complex and the 5′-tail was found to be dynamic, with fluctuations occurring on wide distance and time scales. This suggests that the 5′-tail does not simply bind the MCM surface and fall off, but instead experiences an intricate interaction landscape. Assuming there exists at least one external binding site in each monomer, the MCM hexamer would involve at least six such binding sites, with many possible conformations of the 5′-tail onto these sites. We propose that the external 5′-tail/MCM interaction is weak per binding site, enabling the 5′-tail to break off and diffuse between different sites. The diffusion steps between the different binding sites will therefore depend on the 5′-tail conformation and its arrangement on the various sites, with additional contributing factors such as ssDNA strain and the location of MCM on the 3′-tail. The net result would be a shallow but rugged energy landscape with many possible local minima, which would increase the stability of MCM on the replication fork and determine the distinctive selectivity of MCM for forked substrates. The architecture of replicative helicases at the replication fork during DNA unwinding has been the subject of much debate. Some of the various suggested models are passive unwinding, in which the helicase translocates on one ssDNA and awaits the opening of the junction to translocate forward; and several dynamic models, in which the helicase directly destabilizes the junction (3Maiorano D. Lutzmann M. Mechali M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 13Patel S.S. Donmez I. J. Biol.

For MCM, diverse models have been proposed, including steric exclusion, rotary pump, T-antigen, and Ploughshare (23Delagoutte E. von Hippel P.H. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2002; 35: 431-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 37Takahashi T.S. Wigley D.B. Walter J.C. Trends Biochem.

BioEssays. 2003; 25: 1168-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting an interaction with either single- or double-stranded DNA. In the steric exclusion model, the opposing strand (5′-tail) prevents the helicase from encircling and translocating along the duplex DNA and does not play an additional role once the helicase starts unwinding the DNA. In contrast, our data show that SsoMCM dynamically interacts with the 5′-end, which should also be the case during duplex unwinding. Such dynamic interaction between a ring-shaped helicase and an opposing ssDNA tail has not been elucidated previously. In light of our findings, we propose the following “opposite strand interaction” model for MCM/replication fork association. MCM loads with the 3′-tail accommodated in its central channel, and the 5′-tail binds and diffuses on its surface. This interaction would regulate the binding specificity for forked substrates and aid in the long-term stability of the MCM-replication fork complex and replication fidelity. It should be noted that the weak interaction of MCM with the opposite strand may be beneficial in preventing tangling of ssDNA or stalled replication by ensuring that the interaction is local, whereas it is possible that a single strand binding protein (single-stranded DNA-binding protein or replication protein A) also aids in preventing the MCM surface from binding to ssDNA at a distance. Additionally, as a 3′-5′-helicase MCM will translocate along the leading strand template (3′-tail), its dynamic interaction with the unwound lagging strand template (5′-tail) may facilitate coordination of leading and lagging strand synthesis events. In this regard, it may be relevant that the DNA primase-binding archaeal GINS complex interacts with the trailing N-terminal domains of SsoMCM (45Marinsek N. Barry E.R. Makarova K.S. Dionne I. Koonin E.V. Bell S.D. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Additionally, this type of interaction may be incorporated into the unwinding mechanism of MCM, in which upon ATP hydrolysis, MCM will translocate forward on the ssDNA while drawing the 5′-tail. This combined forward translocation and opposite strand binding may result in sufficient destabilization of the junction, facilitating double-stranded DNA unwinding. Finally, we should also consider the possibility that the observed interaction may have inhibitory effects on the helicase activity (46Ha T. Cell. 2007; 129: 1249-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), which may be lifted if another protein such as the DNA polymerase occupies the opposing strand (47Stano N.M.

Our smFRET study has revealed unique information about dynamic interaction between MCM and the opposite strand in the context of replication fork association with MCM. These findings likely bear relevance to the mechanism of replication fork binding and unwinding by MCM and other replicative helicases. Download .pdf (.25 MB) Help with pdf files"

NHERF1 also inhibited PTH-induced receptor internalization in MC4 osteoblast cells. Reducing constitutive NHERF1 levels in HEK-293 cells with short hairpin RNA directed against NHERF1 augmented PTH1R endocytosis in response to PTH. Mutagenesis of the PDZ-binding domains or deletion of the MERM domain of NHERF1 demonstrated that both are required for inhibition of endocytosis and recycling. Likewise, an intact COOH-terminal PDZ recognition motif in PTH1R is needed. The effect of NHERF1 on receptor internalization and recycling was not associated with altered receptor expression or binding, activation, or phosphorylation but involved β-arrestin and dynamin. We conclude that NHERF1 inhibits endocytosis without affecting PTH1R recycling in MC4 and PTH1R-expressing HEK-293 cells.

Rapid termination of GPCR signaling is mediated by receptor desensitization and internalization, whereas prolonged reduction in responsiveness is due to down-regulation and diminished receptor biosynthesis. Just as GPCR desensitization provides a mechanism to protect cells against excessive stimulation, GPCR resensitization guards cells against prolonged inactivity and hormone resistance.

Class I PDZ proteins, such as NHERF1, recognize in the target protein the sequence motif (D/E)(S/T)XΦ, where X represents any amino acid and Φ is a hydrophobic residue, generally Leu/Ile/Val although it can also be Met (9Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 10Wang S. Raab R.W.

As described below, this recognition sequence is present in the parathyroid hormone (PTH) type I receptor (PTH1R). The MERM domain binds to the actin-associated proteins, merlin, ezrin, radixin, and moesin (3Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar), and tethers the complex to cytoskeletal elements in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and to the catalytic and regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (11Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). NHERF1 binds to β2-adrenergic receptors, enhancing receptor recycling to plasma membranes (12Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). NHERF1 similarly binds to κ-opioid receptors, thereby increasing the rate of recycling of internalized receptors (13Li J.G. Chen C. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Conversely, NHERF1 stabilizes epidermal growth factor receptors at the cell surface and delays their internalization upon epidermal growth factor-mediated receptor endocytosis (14Lazar C.S. Cresson C.M. Lauffenburger D.A. Gill G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 15: 5470-5480Crossref Google Scholar). The PTH1R, which regulates extracellular mineral ion homeostasis, exhibits such recycling behavior, although it is profoundly down-regulated in disease states. The PTH1R also contains a PDZ recognition motif that interacts with NHERF1. The PTH1R belongs to Class B of the seven-transmembrane family of GPCRs (15Gensure R.C. Gardella T.J. Juppner H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 666-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). PTH1R is present primarily in the bone and kidney. Interaction with its cognate ligand, PTH-(1–84), or biologically active peptide fragments leads to activation of Gs and Gq with consequent stimulation of adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C (16Abou-Samra A.B.

A cascade of cell-specific events ensue that regulate virtually all aspects of extracellular calcium and phosphate homeostasis. The NHERF1 PDZ-I domain interacts with the carboxyl terminus of the PTH1R (18Mahon M.J. Donowitz M. Yun C.C. Segre G.V.

Our previous data indicated that NHERF1 regulates the conditional efficacy of PTH ligands on cell-specific PTH1R sequestration (21Sneddon W.B. Syme C.A. Bisello A. Magyar C.E. Weinman E.J.

These processes contribute directly to PTH1R desensitization by facilitating the uncoupling of the receptor from its cognate G proteins. The PTH1R undergoes agonist-promoted endocytosis through a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent process (21Sneddon W.B. Syme C.A. Bisello A. Magyar C.E. Weinman E.J. Rochdi M.D. Parent J.L.

Following internalization, the PTH1R is either recycled to the plasma membrane, leading to receptor resensitization (30Chauvin S. Bencsik M. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. Mol.

In the present study, we demonstrate that most of receptors are recycled to the cell membrane after inducing receptor endocytosis with PTH. Using several different cell models, we show that NHERF1 potently inhibits PTH1R endocytosis and delays PTH1R recycling. This effect requires both intact PDZ and MERM domains in NHERF1.

Tet (50 ng/ml) was added where indicated. 48 h later, the cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture I and incubated for 15 min on ice. Solubilized materials were incubated overnight at 4 °C with HA.11 monoclonal affinity matrix. Total lysates and immunoprecipitated protein, eluted by the addition of SDS sample buffer, were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) using the semi-dry method (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated with different antibodies (polyclonal anti-NHERF1 antibody at 1:1000 and HA.11 ascites monoclonal antibody at 1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG or sheep anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at a 1:5000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized with a luminol-based enhanced chemiluminescence substrate.

PTH1R binding was measured on cells plated on 24-well plates and grown to confluence. PTH-(1–34) or vehicle was added to the culture medium and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Residual cell surface binding was removed by rinsing with ice-cold PBS and acid washing twice with 50 mm glycine, 100 mm NaCl (pH 3). The medium was replenished with Ham's F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were put on ice for 15 min and incubated on ice for an additional 2.5 h with ∼100,000 cpm of [125I][Nle8,18,Tyr34]PTH-(1–34)NH2 in 250 μl of fresh media. Nonspecific binding was determined in parallel incubations of nontransfected CHO-N10 cells with [125I][Nle8,18,Tyr34]PTH-(1–34)NH2 and was subtracted from total binding to calculate specific binding or measured in parallel experiments carried out in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled PTH-(1–34) (21Sneddon W.B.

Cell surface-bound [125I]PTH-(1–34) was assessed by γ spectrometry. Fractional plasma membrane PTH1R binding was calculated as ((cpm of unstimulated control–cpm of PTH)/cpm of unstimulated control) × 100%. Receptor recycling was determined in a similar manner. However, after the 30-min PTH treatment and washout, the cells were returned to 37 °C for the indicated time, after which PTH binding was measured. PTH1R recycling was calculated as (cpm of PTH group/cpm of unstimulated group) × 100%. Receptor number (Bmax) and affinity (Kd) were measured by competitive binding as described, and parameters were determined by Scatchard analysis (Prism) (36Bisello A. Greenberg Z. Behar V.

NHERF1 Effects on PTH1R Internalization and Recycling—Initial characterization of NHERF1 effects on PTH1R trafficking were conducted on an engineered CHO cell model in which NHERF1 levels could be controlled at a constant and biologically relevant number of PTH1R. These cells express 6.0 × 105 PTH1R/cell, with an average Kd of 14.2 nm. Tet (50 ng/ml) induces maximal NHERF1 expression (38Wheeler D.G. Sneddon W.B. Wang B. Friedman P.A. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25076-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). PTH promoted time- and concentration-dependent PTH1R internalization. Receptor endocytosis stimulated by PTH began within 5 min and plateaued by 30 min (Fig. 1A). Therefore, 30 min was used for subsequent determinations of steady-state and maximal effects. Receptor endocytosis proceeded in a concentration-dependent manner with half-maximal PTH1R internalization at 1.2 × 10–10m PTH. Internalized PTH1Rs are either recycled to the plasma membrane or degraded (30Chauvin S. Bencsik M. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. Mol.

Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 605-611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The influence of NHERF1 on PTH1R stabilization and recycling is unknown. In the absence of NHERF1, a 30-min challenge with PTH decreased [125I]PTH binding by 60%, corresponding to internalization of 40% of membrane-bound PTH1Rs (Fig. 1B). This degree of PTH1R endocytosis corresponds favorably to that in other cells and using different techniques (21Sneddon W.B. Syme C.A. Bisello A. Magyar C.E. Weinman E.J. Rochdi M.D. Parent J.L.

Physiol. 2001; 189: 341-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Following induction of NHERF1 expression, PTH1R internalization decreased with a corresponding doubling of membrane-delimited PTH1R from 40 to 78% (Fig. 1B). PTH1R recycling was measured as the rate of recovery of PTH1R binding following maximal internalization. Recycling proceeded in a time-dependent manner with T½ = 52 min in the absence of NHERF1 and 106 min in the presence of NHERF1. Virtually complete recycling was achieved by 2 h in either case. Thus, NHERF1 retards endocytosis and delays PTH1R recycling. The addition of Tet to control CHO-EV-R4 cells lacking the Tet repressor had no effect on receptor internalization or recycling (data not shown). Thus, Tet effects result from induction of NHERF1 expression and not from toxic or nonspecific actions. Further, the rate and extent of PTH1R recycling was indistinguishable in the presence or absence of 200 μm cycloheximide (data not shown), suggesting that de novo PTH1R synthesis does not contribute importantly to the observed findings. Similar experiments were performed on MC4 osteoblastic cells (subclone 4 of MCT3-E1 (40Wang D. Christensen K. Chawla K. Xiao G. Krebsbach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar)) to determine if NHERF1 exerts comparable effects in cells constitutively expressing the PTH1R. MC4 cells express 1.4 ×105 PTH1R/cell with an average Kd of 9.4 nm. After a 30-min exposure to 10–7m PTH-(1–34), 48% of PTH1Rs were located at the cell surface (Fig. 2A). Receptor recycling proceeded in a time-dependent manner with complete recycling by 2 h. Endogenous NHERF1 expression in MC4 cells is negligible (Fig. 2B). Transient transfection of NHERF1 inhibited PTH-induced internalization without affecting the rate of receptor recycling. Complementary experiments were performed on HEK-293 cells, which constitutively express NHERF1 and were stably transfected with the PTH1R. Here, after a 30-min pretreatment with 10–7m PTH, only 25% of PTH1Rs were internalized, with 75% remaining on the cell surface (Fig. 2C). shRNA targeted to NHERF1 substantially reduced PTH1R binding, consistent with a role of NHERF1 to stabilize receptors at the plasma membrane. shRNA reduced endogenous NHERF1 levels by 76% compared with scrambled control (Fig. 2D). The rate constants for recycling (control, 0.03367 min–1; shRNA, 0.02131 min–1) were statistically indistinguishable. NHERF1 Domains Involved in PTH1R Internalization and Recycling—NHERF1 possesses two tandem type 1 PDZ domains. To determine which of these are involved in receptor recycling, we employed NHERF1 constructs harboring mutations of the core-binding sequences in PDZ-1 (sPDZ1-NHERF1), PDZ-2 (sPDZ2-NHERF1), or PDZ-1 plus PDZ-2, (sP"

TRPC4 and TRPC5 form a group within the TRPC subfamily and are activated in a phospholipase C-dependent manner by an unidentified messenger. Unlike most other Ca2+-permeable channels, TRPC4 and -5 are potentiated by micromolar concentrations of La3+ and Gd3+. This effect results from an action of the cations at two glutamate residues accessible from the extracellular solution. Here, we show that TRPC4 and -5 respond to changes in extracellular pH. Lowering the pH increased both G protein-activated and spontaneous TRPC5 currents. Both effects were already observed with small reductions in pH (from 7.4 to 7.0) and increased up to pH 6.5. TRPC4 was also potentiated by decreases in pH, whereas TRPC6 was only inhibited, with a pIC50 of 5.7. Mutation of the glutamate residues responsible for lanthanoid sensitivity of TRPC5 (E543Q and E595Q) modified the potentiation of TRPC5 by acid. Further evidence for a similarity in the actions of lanthanoids and H+ on TRPC5 is the reduction in single channel conductance and dramatic increase in channel open probability in the presence of either H+ or Gd3+ that leads to larger integral currents. In conclusion, the high sensitivity of TRPC5 to H+ indicates that, in addition to regulation by phospholipase C and other factors, the channel may act as a sensor of pH that links decreases in extracellular pH to Ca2+ entry and depolarization.

Like many other cation channels, TRP channels are proposed to have six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) with a re-entrant pore-forming loop between S5 and S6, and intracellular C and N termini (for reviews, see Refs. 1Clapham D.E.

In addition to the transmembrane topology, a number of other structural features are shared between subfamilies. Thus, TRPC, TRPV, and TRPM channels have a characteristic sequence, the TRP box (Fig. 1B), not far from S6 in their cytosolic C termini, and often have regulatory calmodulin-binding domains in the C-terminal tail. TRPC, TRPV, and TRPA channels have N-terminal, cytosolic ankyrin-like repeats, the functional role of which is still unclear. TRP channels also share functional features. Where channel activity has been demonstrated, TRP channels have been shown to be cation channels with relative Ca2+ permeabilities (PCa/PNa) ranging from low (TRPM4 and -5) to high (TRPV5 and -6). Many TRP channels are regulated by phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent mechanisms, including members of the TRPC subfamily, which show PLC-dependent activation, and some TRP channels from other subfamilies, which display PLC-dependent modulation or activation. TRPC4 and TRPC5 are receptor-operated, PLC-dependent, Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channels. However, in contrast to several other members of the TRPC subfamily that are activated by diacylglycerol, the steps linking PLC activity to channel activation remain unclear (for a review, see Ref. 6Plant T.D. Schaefer M. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmakol. 2005; 371: 266-276Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For TRPC5, additional activators have been described, the physiological significance of which is uncertain (7Zeng F. Xu S.Z. Jackson P.K. McHugh D. Kumar B. Fountain S.J. Beech D.J. J. Physiol.

A surprising feature of TRPC4 and TRPC5 and heteromultimeric combinations of TRPC1 and TRPC5 is their strong potentiation (10Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J.

Most other TRP channels, with the exception of TRPV1 (see below), and other Ca2+-permeable cation channels, including voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (14Reichling D.B. MacDermott A.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 441: 199-218Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar), are inhibited by micromolar concentrations of lanthanoids. In contrast to the potentiation of TRPC5 with micromolar concentrations of La3+ and Gd3+, millimolar concentrations cause inhibition (13Jung S. Mühle A. Schaefer M. Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3562-3571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). At the single channel level, the potentiatory and inhibitory effects of La3+ and Gd3+ overlap, with potentiation (an increase in channel open probability) dominating over inhibition (a decrease in conductance) at micromolar concentrations. With a mutational analysis, it was shown that two glutamate residues (Glu543 and Glu595; Fig. 1, A and B), at the start and close to the end of the pore-forming loop, are involved in potentiation. Neutralization of either of these amino acids led to a loss of potentiation, but inhibition persisted. A comparison of the sequences of other TRP channels with that of TRPC5 revealed the presence of glutamates at similar positions in TRPC4, consistent with the lanthanoid potentiation of this isoform (10Schaefer M.

Stresow N. Albrecht N. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3752-3759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but not in other TRPCs. Surprisingly, among the TRP channels, only TRPV1 has glutamates at analogous positions (Glu600 and Glu648; Fig. 1A), and Glu648 is the first glutamate in an EFTE motif that is also present in TRPC4 and -5 (Fig. 1A). It is also particularly significant that Glu600 and Glu648 mediate proton (H+) potentiation of heat- and capsaicin-activated currents and H+ activation of currents through TRPV1, respectively (15Jordt S.E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8134-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that TRPV1 is also lanthanoid (La3+ and Gd3+)-sensitive, an effect mediated by the same key residues that confer responsiveness to H+ (16Tousova K. Vyklicky L. Susankova K. Benedikt J. Vlachova V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 30: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The presence of similar amino acids in analogous positions in the pore loops of TRPV1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 and the potentiatory effects of cations raise the question of whether TRPC5 can respond to H+. In this study, we therefore looked at the effects of H+ on TRPC5. We showed that currents through TRPC5 are potentiated by the extracellular H+ concentration in a range around the physiological pH. Using outside-out patch clamp recordings, it was shown that pH reductions lead to single channel currents through TRPC5 with longer open times and smaller amplitudes, an effect very similar to that of micromolar La3+ or Gd3+. Using point mutants, we investigated the molecular determinants of potentiation of TRPC5 by H+.

Sequences of the mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For experiments with TRPC4, we used the human β-splice variant fused C-terminally to YFP (11Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Stresow N. Albrecht N. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3752-3759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Human TRPC6-pIRES2-EGFP was a gift from V. Chubanov and contained the TRPC6 cDNA derived by Hofmann et al. (18Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) were maintained as described in the supplierŉs recommendations. Transient transfections were performed in 35-mm dishes (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) 1-2 days after plating using the FuGene6 (Roche Applied Science) or the TransIT (Mirus, Madison, WI) transfection kit. The transfected cells were trypsinized and seeded onto glass coverslips or directly into 35-mm Nunc dishes 2 days after transfection. The functional expression of the transfected cDNAs in HEK 293 cells was similar on both surfaces. Patch Clamp Recordings—An EPC-7, EPC-9, or EPC-10 amplifier and Pulse software (HEKA, Lamprecht, Germany) were used for patch clamp recordings. For measurements performed in the whole cell configuration, patch pipettes, made from borosilicate glass (Science Products, Hofheim, Germany), had resistances of 3-6 megaohms when filled with the standard intracellular solution. Cells were clamped at a potential of -50 or -60 mV, as indicated in the figure legend of each experimental series. Current-voltage (I-V) relationships were obtained from voltage ramps from -100 to +100 mV with a duration of 400 ms applied every 4-7 s. Ramp data were acquired with a sampling rate of 5 kHz (EPC-7) or 20 kHz (EPC-9 and EPC-10) after filtering at 1 kHz (EPC-7) or 2.8 kHz (EPC-9 and EPC-10). The holding current was acquired at 30 Hz (X-Chart; HEKA). To quantify current potentiation and current inhibition observed by bath application of H+, we interpolated currents before and after their application and normalized the values obtained in the presence of H+ to the interpolated values. Interpolation was done to avoid errors arising from the fact that currents through TRPC4, -5, and -6 decay with time. To determine pIC50 and pEC50 values, the concentration-response curves for H+ inhibition of TRPC6 (Fig. 2E) and TRPC5-E543Q (Fig. 3C) as well as for H+ activation of TRPC5-wt, -E543Q, and -E595Q/E598Q (Fig. 5D) were fitted with the Hill equation using the built-in fit routine in IGOR Pro 4.09 (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). All single channel recordings were performed in the outside-out configuration at -60 mV. Borosilicate glass pipettes had resistances between 5 and 8 megaohms when filled with the standard intracellular solution. Currents were acquired with a sampling frequency of 20 kHz after filtering at 4 kHz and stored discontinuously as sweeps with durations between 30 s and 2 min. For offline analysis, the single channel traces were filtered at 1 kHz. Events were detected by half-amplitude threshold analysis using a routine programmed in IGOR Pro 4.09. Idealization was subsequently tested by eye for a proper correlation with the acquired data. Single channel amplitudes were obtained by Gaussian fitting the all points histograms. Channel activity was expressed as nPo, the product of the number (n) of channels in the patch (obtained from the observed number of open levels) and the open probability (Po). nPo values were calculated for consecutive 0.5-s periods. Openings with durations shorter than 0.5 ms were excluded from the analysis. Because of extensive overlap of individual unitary current responses after application of H+ or Gd3+, we used an algorithm established by Fenwick et al. (19Fenwick E.M. Marty A. Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1982; 331: 599-635Crossref Scopus (632) Google Scholar) to obtain a reliable estimate of mean open times in the absence and presence of the effectors. The general applicability of the algorithm has been confirmed (20Ramanan S.V. Fan S.F. Brink P.R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1992; 42: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The overall estimate of mean channel open time (to) was calculated according to to = (∑tj)/N, where N is the number of all channel openings (transitions between a given level j and a subsequent level j + 1), tj designates the dwell time of a given level j, and the sum extends over all levels encountered in the recording. Values for tj were extracted from idealized traces generated in IGOR. The standard extracellular solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Extracellular solutions with pH values different from pH 7.4 had similar ionic compositions to the standard extracellular solution and were also titrated with NaOH to the final pH value but buffered with citrate (pH 4.2), MES (pH 5.5, 6.0, 6.3, 6.5 and 6.8), or HEPES (pH 7.0 and 8.0). Total Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations in citrate-buffered solutions were calculated using MaxChelator (Chris Patton, Stanford University, CA). The standard intracellular solution contained 110 mm cesium methane sulfonate, 25 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 3.62 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with CsOH) with a calculated free [Ca2+] of 100 nm. For the measurements summarized in Figs. 2 and 3, the pipette contained 1 mm instead of 10 mm EGTA and 0.362 mm instead of 3.62 mm CaCl2. For AlF4- infusion, 2 μl of 0.5 m NaF were mixed with 1 μl of 3 mm AlCl3 and diluted with 100 μl of the pipette solution. The osmolarity of all solutions was between 290 and 310 mosmol/liter. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20-25 °C). Chemicals—Gadolinium chloride and GTPγS were obtained from Sigma. All stock solutions were made in water and diluted to final concentrations in the bath or pipette solutions. Statistics—All data of the present study are given as mean ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between mean values was assessed using Studentŉs t test. Differences were regarded as statistically significant for p < 0.05 (*) and as highly statistically significant for p < 0.01 (**) or for p < 0.001 (***). Sequence Alignment of the Pore Regions of TRPC4, -5, and -6 and TRPV1—A comparison of the amino acid sequences between their S5 and S6 segments reveals that TRPV1 and TRPC5 have negatively charged amino acids at only three analogous positions (Fig. 1A). Of these glutamates, one is located very close to S5, whereas the other two form part of an EFTE motif in the short stretch of amino acids between the putative pore and S6 (Fig. 1B). The functional relevance of the first and second of the three glutamate residues for the channel-gating properties in the presence of La3+ and Gd3+ has previously been reported for both TRPV1 (Glu600 and Glu648) (16Tousova K. Vyklicky L. Susankova K. Benedikt J. Vlachova V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 30: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and TRPC5 (Glu543 and Glu595) (13Jung S. Mühle A. Schaefer M. Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3562-3571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and in the presence of H+ for TRPV1 (15Jordt S.E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8134-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The proximal glutamate (Glu545) as well as the EFTE motif (starting with Glu594) are also present in TRPC4, consistent with the potentiation of this channel isoform by lanthanoids (10Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17517-17526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 11Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Stresow N. Albrecht N. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3752-3759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, TRPC6, which is only inhibited by La3+ and Gd3+, lacks glutamate residues at positions similar to Glu543 and Glu595 in TRPC5. H+Potentiation of G Protein-activated Currents through TRPC5—We first tested G protein-activated TRPC5 currents for their sensitivity to the extracellular pH value. In whole cell patch clamp recordings from HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with TRPC5, the infusion of 500 μm GTPγS or 30 μmAlF4- into the cytoplasm via the patch pipette activated the channels and led to transient inward currents at negative holding potentials (with mean amplitudes of -50.6 ± 6.9 pA/pF, n = 8, at -60 mV for GTPγS and -15.3 ± 3.2 pA/pF, n = 15, at -50 mV for AlF4-). The I-V relationships of all of these currents were characteristic for some members of the TRPC channel family (e.g. see Ref. 21Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar) and were doubly rectifying with a reversal potential close to 0 mV (Fig. 2A). Decreasing the extracellular pH from 7.4 to 6.5 during the decaying phase of currents through TRPC5 led to significant current increases (Fig. 2A). Responses occurred within a few seconds of changing the extracellular pH and were reversible on returning to the standard extracellular solution (pH 7.4). It is notable that the effect was much more pronounced at negative than at positive potentials. As shown in Fig. 2A, the AlF4--induced inward current amplitude was approximately doubled, whereas the increase at positive potentials was much smaller but significant (currents were increased to 207 ± 12% at -50 mV, and 117 ± 3% at +100 mV; n = 9 and p < 0.001 compared with pH 7.4 in both cases). The possibility that H+ acts as a charge carrier for the additional inward and outward currents is unlikely, since a decrease in pH from 7.4 to 6.5 is tantamount to a change in [H+]o of only 0.276 μm and is not accompanied by a shift in reversal potential. In further experiments to study the concentration dependence of these effects, we also tested intermediate pH values between pH 8.0 and 4.2. These data are summarized in Fig. 2D. Like pH 6.5, decreases in the extracellular pH from 7.4 to 7.0 or 6.0 led to a potentiation of the TRPC5-mediated currents that was much more pronounced at negative potentials. The largest potentiation was observed between pH 6.5 and 6.0. Under more acidic conditions, the potentiation of TRPC5 became weaker, and at pH 4.2, currents were inhibited in all experiments. Raising the pH from 7.4 to 8.0 significantly (p < 0.01) decreased TRPC5-mediated currents in both inward (to 56.0 ± 9.6%, n = 5, at -60 mV) (Fig. 2, A and D) and outward directions (to 76.6 ± 5.0% at +100 mV, n = 5). These data show that the amplitude of inward currents through TRPC5 activated by G protein stimulation strongly depends on the extracellular pH value. The effects of H+ on TRPC5 are concentration-dependent and, like the effects of La3+ and Gd3+ on TRPC5 (13Jung S. Mühle A. Schaefer M. Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3562-3571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), have a biphasic characteristic, with currents increasing from alkaline pH values (pH 8.0) to maximum values between pH 6.5 and 6.0 and then decreasing with further reductions in pH to a nearly complete block at pH 4.2. It has to be noted that two different kinds of endogenous currents were evoked by decreasing the extracellular pH value in recordings from both transfected and untransfected HEK 293 cells. A change to pH 6.5 or more acidic pH values was followed by very brief currents in the range of -0.2 to -1nAat the holding potential (e.g. -14.0 ± 3.7 pA/pF with a duration of 2.2 ± 0.4 s at pH 5.5 in five of five control experiments at -50 mV). From their pH dependence, kinetics, and positive reversal potential, these currents clearly displayed all characteristics previously described for the endogenous acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) in HEK 293 cells (22Gunthorpe M.J. Smith G.D. Davis J.B. Randall A.D. Pflügers Arch. 2001; 442: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and were largely prevented by the application of 30 μm amiloride. However, due to their rapid activation and inactivation, they only overlapped with the initial phase of the observed TRP current potentiation if it all and thus were not routinely blocked. A second type of current, with strong outward rectification and a reversal potential close to 0 mV, was only observed at pH 4.2 and not at higher pH values (four of five control measurements on untransfected HEK 293 cells). This endogenous current was present for the whole time of H+ application and led, despite its relatively small inward component, to a slight underestimate of TRPC current inhibition in all pH-response curves at pH 4.2. Effects of Extracellular H+on Currents Mediated by TRPC4β—From similarities in their cDNA sequences, TRPC4 and TRPC5 are closely related channel subunits. This prompted us to compare the effects of H+ on currents through TRPC4 with those obtained for TRPC5. In whole cell patch clamp recordings from HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with TRPC4β, the intracellular infusion of 500 μm GTPγS led to transient inward currents with average current densities of -45 ± 13 pA/pF (n = 13) at a holding potential of -60 mV. As shown in Fig. 2B, the biophysical characteristics of TRPC4β were consistent with previous reports (10Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17517-17526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 11Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Stresow N. Albrecht N. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3752-3759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Like for TRPC5, currents through TRPC4β were potentiated by a reduction in extracellular pH from pH 7.4 to pH 6.5. At -60 mV, the currents were, on average, increased about 2-fold (to 188 ± 18%, n = 8, p < 0.001), whereas the potentiation was less pronounced at positive potentials (to 115 ± 4% at +100 mV, n = 8, p < 0.01).

https://openalex.org/W2075775644,"UCP3 (uncoupling protein-3) is a mitochondrial membrane transporter expressed preferentially in skeletal muscle. UCP3 lowers mitochondrial membrane potential and protects muscle cells against an overload of fatty acids, and it probably reduces excessive production of reactive oxygen species. Accordingly, ucp3 gene transcription is highly sensitive to fatty acid-dependent stimulation and also to other unrelated stress signals. In this study, glucocorticoids are identified as major inducers of ucp3 gene transcription in muscle. Glucocorticoids activate the transcription of the ucp3 gene through a glucocorticoid receptor-binding site in the promoter region. Glucocorticoids are capable of inducing ucp3 gene transcription independently from the myogenic regulatory factor MyoD, in contrast with the transcriptional activation of the ucp3 gene through other nuclear hormone receptors. An interplay of regulatory factors modulates positively (p300) or negatively (histone deacetylases) the action of glucocorticoids on ucp3 gene transcription via histone acetylation or deacetylation processes, respectively. Among them, SIRT1 acts as a major repressor of ucp3 gene expression in response to glucocorticoids. The action of SIRT1 requires its deacetylase activity and results in histone deacetylation in the ucp3 promoter. Moreover, it involves a specific impairment of association of p300 with the glucocorticoid receptor. Agents activating SIRT1, such as resveratrol, repress ucp3 gene expression. The control of SIRT1 activity via the metabolic redox status of the cell points to a novel regulatory pathway of ucp3 gene transcription in response to metabolic and stress signaling in muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2036891904,"p53 plays an important role in regulating expression of genes that mediate cell cycle progression and/or apoptosis. In addition, we have previously shown that the hydrophilic bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) prevents transforming growth factor β1-induced p53 stabilization and apoptosis in primary rat hepatocytes. Therefore, we hypothesized that p53 may represent an important target in bile acid-induced modulation of apoptosis and cell survival. In this study we demonstrated that UDCA reduces p53 transcriptional activity, thereby preventing its ability to induce Bax expression, mitochondrial translocation, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis in primary rat hepatocytes. More importantly, bile acid inhibition of p53-induced apoptosis was associated with decreased p53 DNA binding activity. Subcellular localization of p53 was also altered by UDCA. Both events appear to be related with increased association between p53 and its direct repressor, Mdm-2. In conclusion, these results further clarify the antiapoptotic mechanism of UDCA and suggest that modulation of Mdm-2/p53 interaction is a prime target for this bile acid. p53 plays an important role in regulating expression of genes that mediate cell cycle progression and/or apoptosis.

Its therapeutic effects have been attributed to several mechanisms, including the ability to stimulate hepatobiliary secretion and inhibit liver cell apoptosis (1Poupon R.E. Balkau B. Eschwege E. Poupon R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1548-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 2Paumgartner G. Beuers U. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that UDCA reduces the apoptotic threshold in several cell types through modulation of classical mitochondrial pathways (3Botla R. Spivey J.R. Aguilar H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J.

Furthermore, reduction of cell death by UDCA may involve alternate and upstream molecular targets of the E2F-1/Mdm-2/p53 apoptotic pathway (6Solá S. Ma X. Castro R.E. Kren B.T. Steer C.J.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcription factor that plays an important role in regulating expression of genes that mediate cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in response to a wide variety of cellular stress factors (8Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar, 9Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2673) Google Scholar). Although its role in suppressing cell cycle progression has been extensively described (10el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W.

Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5201) Google Scholar), less is known about the mechanisms by which p53 induces apoptosis. Curiously, recent studies have revealed that p53 can mediate apoptosis by a transcription-independent process (12Chipuk J.E. Green D.R. J. Clin. Immunol. 2003; 23: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, cells in which wild-type p53 was replaced by a transcriptionally inactive mutant showed loss of both cell cycle arrest and apoptotic functions, supporting the idea that transcriptional activity is of paramount importance in these cellular responses (13Chao C. Saito S. Kang J. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4967-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 14Jimenez G.S. Nister M. Stommel J.M. Beeche M. Barcarse E.A. Zhang X.Q. O'Gorman S. Wahl G.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In fact, it is thought that p53 signals apoptosis through its activity as a sequence-specific transcriptional activator of proapoptotic target genes, such as bax, Noxa, or PUMA (15Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 16Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N.

These proteins are translocated to mitochondria, where they promote loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release, thus activating the Apaf-1/caspase-9 apoptotic cascade (18Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Indeed, Apaf-1 itself has also been described as a transcriptional target for p53 (19Moroni M.C. Hickman E.S. Lazzerini Denchi E. Caprara G. Colli E. Cecconi F. Muller H. Helin K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in unstressed conditions p53 is a short-lived protein. Pivotal to its regulation is the function of the murine double minute-2 (Mdm-2) protein (20Freedman D.A. Wu L. Levine A.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). p53 is tightly regulated by a negative feedback loop where the tumor suppressor induces Mdm-2 transcription, which in turn binds to p53 and inhibits its function (21Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar) (22Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar). The Mdm-2 protein has been shown to inhibit p53 activity by binding to its transactivation domain, targeting it to ubiquitination, transporting it to the cytoplasm, and promoting its degradation by the proteasome. The precise mechanism(s) involved in p53 stabilization with response to stress remains unclear. It has been shown that it involves a series of post-translational modifications to both p53 and Mdm-2, which in turn may facilitate the dissociation of the Mdm-2/p53 complex (23Lavin M.F. Gueven N. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that UDCA decreases E2F-1 transcriptional activation, thus preventing the downstream events of transforming growth factor-β1-induced cell death associated with Mdm-2 degradation and p53 stabilization (6Solá S.

Moreover, microarray analysis revealed that UDCA incubation increased an expressed sequence tag (EST) highly similar to Mdm-2 protein while decreasing another EST for p53-apoptosis-associated target (24Castro R.E. Sola S. Ma X. Ramalho R.M. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Rodrigues C.M. J. Hepatol. 2005; 42: 897-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in primary rat hepatocytes. Finally, UDCA was shown to alter Mdm-2 protein levels in several cell types (6Solá S. Ma X. Castro R.E. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Rodrigues C.M. J. Biol.

Here we further explore the molecular events underlying the cytoprotective role of UDCA in p53-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes. Our results indicate that UDCA inhibits p53 transactivation and its DNA binding activity in hepatocytes by preventing nuclear accumulation of this tumor suppressor protein, in part, through a p53/Mdm-2 binding-dependent mechanism. Hepatocyte Isolation and Cell Culture—Rat primary hepatocytes were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (100–150 g) by collagenase perfusion as described previously (26Mariash C.N. Seelig S. Schwartz H.L. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9583-9586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, rats were anesthetized with phenobarbital, and the livers were perfused with 0.05% collagenase. Hepatocyte suspensions were obtained by passing collagenase-digested livers though 125-μm gauze and washing cells in William's E medium supplemented with 26 mm sodium bicarbonate, 23 mm HEPES, 0.01 units/ml insulin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 nm dexamethasone, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and was typically 80–85%. After isolation, hepatocytes were resuspended in William's E medium and plated on Primaria™ tissue culture dishes (BD Biosciences) at either 5 × 104 cells/cm2 for cell morphology assays or 2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 for all other experiments. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 4 h to allow attachment. Plates were then washed with medium to remove dead cells and incubated in William's E medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Transfections and Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT) Assays—Transfections were performed using two expression plasmids, pCMV-p53wt and pCMV-p53179, and a bax promoter-driven CAT reporter construct. The bax-CAT construct consisted of a 371-base pair SmaI/SacI fragment of human bax gene subcloned into the HindIII site of the promoterless CAT plasmid, pUCSV0CAT (15Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Overexpression plasmids were generated by cloning either wild-type p53 (pCMV-p53wt) or a mutant inactive form of human p53 (pCMV-p53179(H179E)), all under cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter control (27Unger T. Nau M.M. Segal S. Minna J.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Twelve hours after plating, hepatocytes were treated with vehicle or 100 μm of UDCA and co-transfected with 2 μg of both expression and reporter plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For normalization, cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of the luciferase reporter construct, PGL3-Control vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Transfection efficiencies of ∼70% were determined in primary rat hepatocytes using a reporter plasmid expressing β-galactosidase and did not differ between reporter and expression plasmids. At 48 h post-transfection, attached cells were harvested for CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science) and luciferase assays (Promega), according to the manufacturers' instructions. In parallel experiments, hepatocytes were pretreated with vehicle or 100 μm UDCA 12 h before transfection with 8 μg of each expression plasmid. Cells overexpressing either wild-type or mutant p53 were harvested for protein extraction and immunoblot analysis. Nuclear, mitochondrial, and cytosolic protein fractions or total proteins were prepared at 36 or 60 h after transfection. Attached cells were fixed for morphologic evaluation of apoptosis and culture medium used for lactate dehydrogenase viability assays. Short Interference-mediated Silencing of the mdm-2 Gene—A pool of 4 short interference RNA (siRNA) nucleotides designed to knock down mdm-2 gene expression in rats was purchased from Dharmacon (Waltham, MA). A control siRNA containing a scrambled sequence that does not lead to the specific degradation of any known cellular mRNA was used as control. Four hours after p53 overexpression, the culture medium was changed, and hepatocytes were transfected using INTERFER-in™ Transfection reagent for siRNA (Polyplus-transfection, Illkirch, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions for additional 48 h. The final concentration of siRNAs was 10 nm. UDCA was re-added to the cultures after the first 4 h of silencing. Floating and attached cells were harvested for preparation of total, nuclear, and cytosolic protein extracts, which were then subjected to immunoblot analysis. Attached cells were fixed for Hoechst staining. Measurement of Cell Death and Caspase Activity—Cell viability was measured by the lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma-Aldrich) viability assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. In addition, Hoechst labeling of cells was used to detect apoptotic nuclei. Briefly, the medium was gently removed to prevent detachment of cells. Attached hepatocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, for 10 min at room temperature, incubated with Hoechst dye 33258 (Sigma) at 5 μg/ml in PBS for 5 min, washed with PBS, and mounted using PBS:glycerol (3:1, v/v). Fluorescent nuclei were scored blindly and categorized according to the condensation and staining characteristics of chromatin. Normal nuclei showed non-condensed chromatin dispersed over the entire nucleus. Apoptotic nuclei were identified by condensed chromatin, contiguous to the nuclear membrane, as well as nuclear fragmentation of condensed chromatin. Five random microscopic fields per sample of ∼100 nuclei were counted, and mean values were expressed as the percentage of apoptotic nuclei. In addition, caspase activity was determined in cytosolic protein extracts after harvesting and homogenization of cells in isolation buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete; Roche Applied Science). General caspase-3-like activity was determined by enzymatic cleavage of chromophore p-nitroanilide from the substrate N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide (Sigma-Aldrich). The proteolytic reaction was carried out in isolation buffer containing 50 μg of cytosolic protein and 50 μm DEVD-p-nitroanilide. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the formation of p-nitroanilide was measured at 405 nm using a 96-well plate reader. In addition, caspase-3 cleavage was determined by immunoblotting. p53-DNA Binding Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The TransAM™ p53 transcription factor assay kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Nuclear extracts were diluted to 2 μg/ml total protein with lysis buffer. Extracts were applied to plates containing immobilized 20-mer oligonucleotide with a p53 consensus binding site (5′-GGACATGCCCGGGCATGTCC-3′). After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, plates were washed and incubated with diluted p53 antibody (1:1000) for an additional 1 h. Diluted anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:1000) was then added to previously washed plates, and developing solution was added and incubated for 5–8 min to allow color development. The reaction was stopped, and absorbance was read at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 650 nm. In addition, both nuclear and cytosolic protein fractions were analyzed for p53 by immunoblotting. Bax Translocation and Cytochrome c Release—Cellular distribution of Bax and cytochrome c was determined using mitochondrial and cytosolic protein extracts. Cells were harvested and centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed once in ice-cold PBS and resuspended with 3 volumes of isolation buffer containing 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture tablets in 250 mm sucrose. After chilling on ice for 15 min, cells were disrupted by 40 strokes of a glass homogenizer, and homogenates were centrifuged twice at 2500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The mitochondrial fraction was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer and frozen at -80 °C. For cytosolic proteins, the 12,000 × g supernatants were removed, filtered sequentially through 0.2- and 0.1-μm Ultra-free MC filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to remove other cellular organelles, and frozen at -80 °C. Immunoblotting—For Bax and cytochrome c detection, 40 μg of mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins were separated by 14% SDS-PAGE. In addition, steady-state levels of Bax and p53 as well as p53 cellular distribution and caspase-3 cleavage were also determined. After electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, the immunoblots were incubated with 15% H2O2 for 15 min at room temperature. After blocking with a 5% milk solution, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary mouse monoclonal antibodies reactive to Bax (B-9), p53 (Pab 240), p-p53 (mSer 20), caspase-3 (H-227), cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (K-20), lamin A/C (346) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), p-p53 (phospho-Ser-15, Ab-3; Calbiochem), and cytochrome c (7H8.2C12; Pharmingen) and finally with secondary goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) for 3 h at room temperature. The membranes were processed for protein detection using the SuperSignal substrate (Pierce). β-Actin (AC-15, Sigma-Aldrich), lamin A/C, and cytochrome c oxidase were used as loading controls for total, nuclear, and mitochondrial proteins, respectively. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's specifications. Immunoprecipitation—Binding of p53 to Mdm-2 was detected by immunoprecipitation analysis. In brief, whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction reagent (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using a primary mouse monoclonal antibody to Mdm-2 (SMP 14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the Ezview Red Protein G Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich). Typically, 200 μg of lysate were incubated with 1 μg of Mdm-2 antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immunoblots were then probed with the mouse monoclonal anti-p53 antibody. Mdm-2 expression was determined in the same membrane after stripping off the immune complex for the detection of p53. Immunoprecipitation assays using high detergent conditions as well as immunoblot analysis showed an absence of nonspecific binding of the Mdm-2 antibody to p53. In addition, immunoprecipitation assays using the mouse monoclonal antibody reactive to β-actin demonstrated no association with either p53 or Mdm-2. Immunofluorescence—Primary rat hepatocytes overexpressing wild-type p53 in the presence or absence of UDCA were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min. After fixation, cells were blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X-100, 1% fetal bovine serum, and 10% normal donkey serum. Cells were then sequentially incubated with monoclonal antibody to p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:200 in blocking solution, overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, after three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with aminomethyl coumarin (AMCA)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for 2 h along with fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged UDCA. Subcellular localization of p53 and UDCA was visualized using an Axioskop fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Densitometry and Statistical Analysis—The relative intensities of protein bands were analyzed using the Quantity One Version 4.6 densitometric analysis program (Bio-Rad) and normalized to the respective loading controls. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad InStat Version 3.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) for the analysis of variance and Bonferroni’s multiple comparison tests. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. UDCA Reduces p53 Transactivation—In addition to its role in cell cycle progression and senescence, p53 also induces apoptosis. Furthermore, we have previously shown that UDCA prevented transforming growth factor-β1-induced p53 stabilization and apoptosis in primary rat hepatocytes (6Solá S. Ma X. Castro R.E. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Rodrigues C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48831-48838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We now hypothesize that p53 may represent an important target in bile acid-induced modulation of apoptosis. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that total p53 expression was increased in cells transfected with pCMV-p53wt and pCMV-p53179 overexpressing plasmids as compared with endogenous levels of pCMV-transfected cells (Fig. 1A). Our results showed significant levels of apoptosis in cultured primary rat hepatocytes after transfection with wild-type p53 overexpression plasmid, as assessed by changes in nuclear morphology (Fig. 1B), caspase activity, and processing (Fig. 1C) (p < 0.01). Mutant p53 only slightly increased cell death (data not shown), implying a transcription-independent role of p53 in apoptosis. Notably, pretreatment with UDCA reduced the levels of apoptosis to those of controls transfected with mutant p53 (p < 0.01) while inhibiting caspase-3-like activity and caspase-3 processing by 90% (p < 0.05). In addition, camptothecin, a topoisomerase I inhibitor known to induce p53 accumulation, resulted in ∼25% hepatocyte apoptosis, and this was inhibited with UDCA by ∼80% (p < 0.01). Similar results were obtained with the lactate dehydrogenase viability assay (data not shown). It is well established that p53 binds to specific sequences within the promoter of various genes to modulate their expression. Proapoptotic Bax was the first member of the Bcl-2 gene family shown to be induced by p53 (15Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 28Thornborrow E.C. Patel S. Mastropietro A.E. Schwartzfarb E.M. Manfredi J.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 990-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, primary rat hepatocytes were cotransfected with a reporter gene construct containing the bax gene promoter to drive transcription of CAT in combination with wild-type or mutant p53 overexpression plasmids. At 48 h after transfection cell death was associated with a strong transactivation of the bax gene promoter by >5-fold compared with cells overexpressing mutant p53 (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2A). Notably, when hepatocytes were incubated with UDCA, p53-induced bax transcription was reduced by ∼50% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). Taurine- and glycine-conjugated derivatives of UDCA were similarly protective. In contrast, treatment with hydrophobic bile acids, such as deoxycholic, lithocholic, and chenodeoxycholic acids, resulted in increased bax transcriptional activation up to 25-fold (p < 0.05) (supplemental data). This may explain the toxicity and increased levels of apoptosis seen in hepatocytes incubated with these bile acids (data not shown). Thus, UDCA is a specific, strong repressor of p53-driven bax transcription. UDCA Prevents p53-induced Bax Expression and Translocation—It has been demonstrated that UDCA plays an important role in preventing apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway (3Botla R. Spivey J.R. Aguilar H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 930-938PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rodrigues C.M. Fan G. Ma X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2790-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 5Rodrigues C.M. Ma X. Linehan-Stieers C. Fan G. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To further characterize the mechanism by which UDCA modulates p53-mediated apoptosis, we analyzed the expression and subcellular distribution of its downstream target, Bax. Total protein extracts were prepared from primary rat hepatocytes overexpressing either wild-type or mutant p53 in the presence or absence of the bile acid. In addition, at 60 h post-transfection, hepatocytes overexpressing wild-type p53 showed an almost 50% increase in Bax protein compared with control cells expressing mutant p53 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). Notably, the levels of total p53 remained unaltered. In contrast, pretreatment with UDCA completely abolished p53-driven Bax expression (p < 0.01). As expected, cells transfected with wild-type p53 showed significantly increased Bax translocation from the cytosol to mitochondria, which in turn was significantly prevented by UDCA (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). The release of cytochrome c into the cytosol was consistent with the observed changes in Bax. Thus, these results suggest that UDCA prevents hepatocyte apoptosis associated with wild-type p53 overexpression by abrogating p53 transcriptional activity. This then leads to reduced total levels of Bax in the cell and decreased Bax translocation to the mitochondria. UDCA Inhibits DNA Binding Activity of p53—Activation of p53 involves stabilization of the protein and enhancement of its DNA binding activity (29Haupt S. Berger M. Goldberg Z. Haupt Y. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4077-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). When stabilized, p53 accumulates in the nucleus and regulates the expression of numerous proapoptotic genes by binding to their promoter sequences (30Yu J. Zhang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanism by which UDCA inhibits p53 transactivation, we evaluated DNA binding activity of p53 in hepatocytes with or without UDCA. Nuclear extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection with p53 overexpression plasmids, and DNA-bound p53 was assayed in the nuclear lysates. As shown in Fig. 4, levels of DNA-bound p53 were 6-fold increased in cells overexpressing wild-type p53 relative to the mutant form (p < 0.01). Notably, when cells were pretreated with UDCA, there was a reduction of ∼50% in DNA binding activity of p53 (p < 0.05). The presence of the bile acid in cells with mutant p53 did not alter the transcription factor binding activity. This suggests that UDCA-mediated decrease in p53-DNA binding may result from either a direct interference or indirect inhibition of p53 stabilization and/or accumulation in the nucleus. To address this question we prepared nuclear protein extracts from both wild-type and mutant-transfected cells, incubated the extracts with UDCA, and analyzed p53-DNA binding activity. Curiously, the results showed that the bile acid was unable to prevent p53-DNA binding by directly interfering with nuclear proteins and/or DNA (Fig. 4). In addition, preliminary circular dichroism results suggest that UDCA does not interact directly with the p53 core DNA-binding domain (data not shown). However, it is possible that UDCA requires cooperation with other cellular factors to reduce nuclear p53 stability, thus compromising its transcriptional activity. UDCA Represses p53 Transcriptional Activity via Increased Binding to Mdm-2—The p53 inhibitor Mdm-2 is a key regulator of p53 abundance and activity. It inhibits the transcriptional activity of p53 and, more importantly, promotes its shuttling to the cytoplasm and subsequent degradation by the proteasome (21Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar, 22Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have previously reported that UDCA prevented the decrease of Mdm-2 protein levels associated with transforming growth factor-β1-induced cell death (6Solá S. Ma X. Castro R.E. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Rodrigues C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48831-48838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Mdm-2 was an important regulatory factor in the antiapoptotic function of UDCA, we performed posttranscriptional mdm-2 gene silencing experiments. As a control for the specificity of siRNA, cells were transfected with a nonspecific pool of siRNAs. Western blot analysis confirmed that Mdm-2 expression decreased by ∼70% after transfection with specific"

Among them, betaine appears to play an important role in conferring resistance to stresses. Betaine is synthesized via either choline oxidation or glycine methylation. An increased betaine level in transgenic plants is one of the potential strategies to generate stress-tolerant crop plants. Here, we showed that an exogenous supply of serine or glycine to a halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica, which synthesizes betaine from glycine by a three-step methylation, elevated intracellular accumulation of betaine under salt stress. The gene encoding 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGDH), which catalyzes the first step of the phosphorylated pathway of serine biosynthesis, was isolated from A. halophytica. Expression of the Aphanothece PGDH gene in Escherichia coli caused an increase in levels of betaine as well as glycine and serine. Expression of the Aphanothece PGDH gene in Arabidopsis plants, in which the betaine synthetic pathway was introduced via glycine methylation, further increased betaine levels and improved the stress tolerance. These results demonstrate that PGDH enhances the levels of betaine by providing the precursor serine for both choline oxidation and glycine methylation pathways.

Salinity is a major problem affecting world overall agricultural production. Approximately 20% of the cultivated land worldwide is impaired by high salinity which causes ion imbalance and hyperosmotic stress in plants (1Zhu J.-K. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 66-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). Plants have evolved various strategies to cope with salinity, including the accumulation of low molecular weight organic compatible solutes (osmoprotectants) such as sugars, some amino acids, and quaternary ammonium compounds (2Rhodes D. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 357-384Crossref Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 3Hanson A.D. Rathinasabapathi B. Rivoal J. Burnet M. Dillon M.O. Gage D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Glycine betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine, hereafter betaine) is a major osmoprotectant to protect plants from high salinity (2Rhodes D. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 357-384Crossref Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 3Hanson A.D. Rathinasabapathi B. Rivoal J. Burnet M. Dillon M.O. Gage D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Most known biosynthetic pathways of betaine include a two-step oxidation of choline: choline → betaine aldehyde → betaine. The first step is catalyzed by choline monooxygenase (CMO) in plants (5Rathinasabapathi B. Burnet M. Russell B.L. Gage D.A. Liao P.C. Nye G.J. Scott P. Golbeck J.H. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The second step is catalyzed by betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) in all organisms (6Lamark T. Kaasen I. Eshoo M.W. McDougall J. Strom A.R. Mol.

Introducing the betaine synthetic pathway into betaine non-accumulating plants has been applied to improve salt tolerance of plants (8Hayashi H. Alia Mustardy L. Deshnium P. Ida M. Murata N.

Supplying betaine precursors such as choline, ethanolamine, and serine to the transformed plants enhance betaine accumulation. Thus, the availability of betaine precursors limits the betaine biosynthesis (15Hibino T. Waditee R. Araki E. Ishikawa H. Aoki K. Tanaka Y. Takabe T. J. Biol.

Recently, we showed that a halotolerant cyanobacterium, Aphanothece halophytica (A. halophytica), synthesizes betaine from glycine by a three-step methylation, which is catalyzed by two N-methyltransferases (ApGSMT and ApDMT). ApGSMT is responsible for the two-step methylation reactions of glycine to sarcosine and then sarcosine to dimethylglycine. ApDMT is responsible for the specific methylation of dimethylglycine to betaine (19Waditee R. Tanaka Y. Aoki K. Hibino T. Jikuya H. Takano J. Takabe T. Takabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4932-4942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Co-expression of ApGSMT and ApDMT in fresh water Synechococcus cells accumulated significant amounts of betaine and conferred sufficient salt tolerance so the cells were capable of growth in sea-water. Arabidopsis plants that were transformed with ApGSMT and ApDMT accumulated substantial amounts of betaine and increased tolerance to salt stress (20Waditee R. Bhuiyan M.N.H. Rai V. Aoki K. Tanaka Y. Hibino T. Suzuki S. Takano J. Jagendorf A.T. Takabe T. Takabe T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1318-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, in this case, the exogenous supply of glycine enhanced the accumulation level of betaine. Serine and glycine are readily interconvertible by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) (21Bauwe H. Kolukisaoglu U. J. Exp. Bot. 2003; 54: 1523-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), thus enhancement of serine biosynthesis would eventually lead to the increased level of glycine. Serine biosynthesis in plants proceeds by two pathways: the so-called phosphorylated pathway and the photorespiratory pathway (21Bauwe H. Kolukisaoglu U. J. Exp. Bot. 2003; 54: 1523-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 22Ho C.L. Noji M. Saito M. Saito K. J. Biol.

In the photorespiratory pathway, serine and glycine are the intermediates produced by ten different enzymes and are subsequently recycled as 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) 2The abbreviations used are: 3-PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; ApDMT, A. halophytica dimethylglycine methyltransferase; ApGSMT, A. halophytica glycine sarcosine methyltransferase; ApPGDH, A. halophytica 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PGDH, 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PHP, phosphohydroxypyruvate; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. 2The abbreviations used are: 3-PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; ApDMT, A. halophytica dimethylglycine methyltransferase; ApGSMT, A. halophytica glycine sarcosine methyltransferase; ApPGDH, A. halophytica 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PGDH, 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PHP, phosphohydroxypyruvate; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. to the Calvin cycle (21Bauwe H. Kolukisaoglu U. J. Exp. Bot. 2003; 54: 1523-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the phosphorylated pathway, serine is derived from 3-PGA. d-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PGDH; EC 1.1.1.95), which is responsible for the first step in this pathway, catalyzes the oxidation of 3-PGA to form phosphohydroxypyruvate (PHP) by utilizing NAD as a cofactor. PHP is subsequently transaminased by phosphoserine aminotransferase to yield phosphoserine, which is then dephosphorylated to serine by phosphoserine phosphatase (23Ho C.L. Saito K. Amino Acids. 2001; 20: 243-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). 3-PGA is the reaction product catalyzed by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphatase carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). Moreover, 3-PGA is produced from sucrose and starch via the glycolysis pathway. Therefore, 3-PGA would be produced in significant amounts in photosynthetic organisms. Although an increase in transcript level of Arabidopsis PGDH (AtPGDH) has been mentioned (23Ho C.L. Saito K. Amino Acids. 2001; 20: 243-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the role of PGDH on abiotic-stress tolerance has never been examined in plants. In cyanobacteria, there is evidence indicating that cyanobacteria are capable of synthesizing serine directly from 3-PGA (24Colman B. Norman E. Physiologia Plantarum. 1997; 100: 133-136Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, the route for serine biosynthesis via 3-PGA in higher plants remains largely unexplored. In the present study, the Aphanothece PGDH gene (ApPGDH) was isolated and functionally characterized. A. halophytica was originally isolated from the Dead Sea and is known to accumulate significant amounts of betaine at high salinity (19Waditee R. Tanaka Y. Aoki K. Hibino T. Jikuya H. Takano J. Takabe T. Takabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4932-4942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The ApPGDH gene was transferred into Escherichia coli, which has a betaine synthetic pathway via choline oxidation; it was also transferred into Arabidopsis plants, in which the betaine synthetic pathway was introduced via glycine methylation. The results manifested that the heterogeneous expression of ApPGDH significantly enhanced betaine levels in both betaine accumulating and non-accumulating organisms. Strains, Culture Conditions, and Chemicals—E. coli strains DH5α and BL21 (DE3) were used for the cloning and expression of protein, respectively. E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C in LB or MMA media containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The growth of E. coli cells was monitored by measuring the optical density at 620 nm (A620) with an Erma AE-22 photoelectric colorimeter. A. halophytica cells were grown photoautotrophically in BG11 liquid medium plus 18 mm NaNO3 and Turk Island salt solution at 28 °C, as previously described (25Hibino T. Kaku N. Yoshikawa H. Takabe T. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A Hitrap-Q Sepharose column was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. PHP was prepared from the hydroxypyruvic acid phosphate dimethylketal (cyclohexylammonium) salt, as described previously (26Ballou C.E. Hesse R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 3718-3720Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Other chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from Katayama (Tokyo, Japan). Cloning and Expression of Recombinant ApPGDH—The genomic DNA of A. halophytica was partially sequenced by a shotgun method using a Shimadzu multicapillary DNA sequencing system (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). A homology search was made using the BLAST program, as previously described (27Waditee R. Hibino T. Tanaka Y. Nakamura T. Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36931-36938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The ApPGDH gene, homologous to several PGDHs from the genome data base of bacteria, plants, and animals, was found. The coding region of the ApPGDH gene was amplified by PCR from A. halophytica genomic DNA using the primer set, ApPGDH-NcoF and ApPGDH-BamR. The sequences of all the primers are shown in Table 1. The amplified fragments of ApPGDH were ligated into the EcoRV restriction site of pBlueScript SK+. The resulting plasmid, pAp-PGDHSK (BamHI), was transferred into E. coli DH5α cells. The DNA sequence of ApPGDH in the plasmid was determined using a 310-genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and analyzed with the DNASIS program (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Kanagawa, Japan).TABLE 1Primers for isolation and expression of the ApPGDH genePrimers5′-3′Base pairsApPGDH-NcoF5′–ACCCATGGCAAAAGTTTTAGTTTCAG–3′26 merApPGDH-SalR5′–CCGTCGACGAGTTTAATGGTGTAAGCATC–3′29 merApPGDH-BamR5′–CTGGATCCTTAGAGTTTAATGGTGTAAGC–3′29 merpreAtPGDH-NcoF5′–AGCCATGGCATTTTCATCTTCGTGT–3′25 merpreAtPGDH-NcoR5′–GGCCATGGGCTTTGGAAGAGTTGGA–3′25 merHisBamH-R5′–GTGGATCCTCAATGATGATGATGATG–3′26 mer Open table in a new tab The expression vector of ApPGDH was constructed by digestion of the plasmid pApPGDHSK (BamHI) with NcoI and BamHI, and then ligated into the corresponding sites of the pET3d plasmid. The resulting plasmid pApPGDH-PET3D was transferred first into E. coli DH5α cells and then into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pApPGDH-PET3D were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) until absorbance at 620 nm (A620) reached 0.5–0.6. Then, 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added, and the cells were grown for another 3 h. Cells from 0.5-liter cultures were then harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min and washed twice with Buffer A (200 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Total cell extracts were obtained by sonication with a Kubota Insonator 201 m at 180 watts for 15 min. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The soluble ApPGDH protein was precipitated by the addition of ammonium sulfate (25% of saturation). The precipitated fraction was dissolved in Buffer A and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialyzed soluble fraction was applied onto a Hitrap-Q Sepharose column (4.6 mm × 5.0 cm). The ApPGDH protein was eluted with a gradient of 0–1000 mm NaCl. Fractions containing ApPGDH were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and applied to the same column. After two rounds of column chromatography, the purified ApPGDH protein was obtained. Construction of Transgenic Arabidopsis Plants Expressing ApPGDH—The ApPGDH gene was amplified from genomic DNA of A. halophytica by the primer set, ApPGDH-NcoF and ApPGDH-SalR. The amplified ApPGDH gene was ligated into the EcoRV restriction site of pBlueScript SK+. The resulting plasmid, pApPGDHSK (SalI), was digested with NcoI and SalI, and ligated into the corresponding sites of the pTrcHis2C plasmid, generating pApPGDH-HIS6. The ApPGDH coding region with a C-terminal His6 tag was amplified by the primer set, ApPGDH-NcoF and HisBamH-R using the plasmid pAp-PGDH-His6 as a template. The amplified fragment was ligated into the EcoRV site of pBSK+ to generate pApPGDH-His6-SK+. Then, the fragment was prepared by double digestion with XbaI and KpnI and ligated into the corresponding sites of the pBI101H.35S binary vector. The resulting plasmid, pBI101H-ApPGDH-His6, was transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 by electroporation. Arabidopsis plants were transformed using the floral dip method (28Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformed plants were selected on Murashige and Skoog (MS) (29Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53704) Google Scholar) agar media with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 25 μg/ml hygromycin, and later transferred to soil for seed production. Transformants with empty vector, pBI101H.35S were also produced. Homozygous transgenic plants (T3 generation) showing high expression levels of ApPGDH protein were used for further analysis. To construct transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing ApPGDH, which is targeted into the chloroplast, the fragment encoding a 60-amino acid transit peptide for chloroplast targeting was amplified from the Arabidopsis PGDH gene (22Ho C.L. Noji M. Saito M. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 397-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) by PCR using the primer set, preAtPGDH-NcoF and preAtPGDH-NcoR. The amplified fragment was ligated into the NcoI site of pApPGDH-His6-SK+ to generate the pAtTP-ApPGDH-His6-SK+ vector. The fragment carrying a transit peptide of AtPGDH, ApPGDH, and a C-terminal His6 tag was prepared by double digestion of the pAtTP-ApPGDH-His6-SK+ vector with BamH1 and KpnI. The resulting fragment was ligated into the corresponding sites of pBI101H.35S binary vector. The resulting plasmid, pBI101H-AtTP-ApPGDH-His6, was transferred into A. tumefaciens strain LBA4404 by electroporation. Arabidopsis plants were transformed using the floral dip method. Homozygous transgenic plants (T3 generation) showing high expression levels of ApPGDH were used for further analysis. The Arabidopsis plants expressing ApPGDH, ApGSMT, and ApDMT were generated by crossing between the transgenic plants expressing ApPGDH and the transgenic plants expressing ApGSMT and ApDMT (20Waditee R. Bhuiyan M.N.H. Rai V. Aoki K. Tanaka Y. Hibino T. Suzuki S. Takano J. Jagendorf A.T. Takabe T. Takabe T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1318-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). F1 progeny plants were screened for the presence of the genes by PCR and confirmed by Western blotting. Progeny plants that accumulated high expression levels of ApPGDH, ApGSMT, and ApDMT were used for further analysis. Plant Material, Growth Conditions, and Stress Treatments—A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) was used as the wild type in this study. The seeds of wild type and transgenic plants were germinated and grown on MS agar medium in a growth chamber at 22 °C with a 16-h light (200 μE m−2 s−1)/8-h dark cycle and 60% relative humidity, unless otherwise stated. For the germination test, surface-sterilized seeds were stratified in the dark for 3 days and then plated on the MS agar medium and incubated in the growth chamber. For salt-stress treatment, seeds were sown on the MS agar medium containing various NaCl concentrations. For low temperature treatment, plants were grown on the MS agar medium and incubated at 5, 10, and 22 °C. For dark treatment, three- or four-week-old plants grown on the MS agar medium were transferred into the dark for 3 days, and the samples were then immediately collected for further analysis. The quantum yield in photosystem II (PSII) was measured with a MiniPAM chlorophyll fluorescence system (Walz Effeltrich, Germany), as previously described (20Waditee R. Bhuiyan M.N.H. Rai V. Aoki K. Tanaka Y. Hibino T. Suzuki S. Takano J. Jagendorf A.T. Takabe T. Takabe T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1318-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Amino Acid Analysis—E. coli cells or plant tissues were homogenized in absolute methanol. The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was re-extracted with 90% methanol. Methanol extracts were dried in a vacuum rotary evaporator at 45 °C. The dry residues were re-extracted with a mixture of water and chloroform (1:1, v/v). The upper aqueous phase was filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane filter. The filtrate was dried in a vacuum and stored at -20 °C until use. At the time of analysis, samples were dissolved in mobile phase solution (pH 2.6) containing 14.1 g of trilithium citrate tetrahydrate, 70 ml of 2-methoxyethanol, and 13.3 ml of 60% HClO4 per liter and injected into a shim-pack Li column of the amino acid analyzer (Shimadzu, Japan). Enzyme Assay—PGDH activity was assayed as previously described with some modifications (22Ho C.L. Noji M. Saito M. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 397-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity of PGDH in the direction of NADH oxidation (the reverse reaction) was carried out at 30 °C. The assay mixture in a volume of 0.5 ml contained 10 μl of purified enzyme, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 μm NADH, 400 mm KCl, and 90 μm PHP. The reaction was started by addition of PHP. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount that oxidizes 1 μmol of NADH per min under the indicated conditions. PGDH activity for the forward direction was also assayed at 30 °C. The assay mixture (500 μl) contained 10 μl of purified enzyme, 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 25 mm EDTA, 5 mm 3-PGA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm NAD+. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 3-PGA. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount that reduces 1 μmol of NAD+ per min under the indicated conditions. For the measurement of PGDH activity in plants, crude extracts were prepared by homogenizing plant tissues with buffer A and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were used for the enzyme assay. Other Methods—SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses were carried out according to standard protocol as described previously (20Waditee R. Bhuiyan M.N.H. Rai V. Aoki K. Tanaka Y. Hibino T. Suzuki S. Takano J. Jagendorf A.T. Takabe T. Takabe T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1318-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Antibody raised against His6 was obtained from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). Protein content was determined by the Lowry method as previously described (15Hibino T. Waditee R. Araki E. Ishikawa H. Aoki K. Tanaka Y. Takabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41352-41360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of native ApPGDH protein was estimated by using gel filtration chromatography with a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Chloroplast was prepared as described (30Somerville C.R. Somerville S.C. Ogren W.L. Plant Sci. Lett. 1981; 21: 89-96Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Betaine was measured as described previously (15Hibino T. Waditee R. Araki E. Ishikawa H. Aoki K. Tanaka Y. Takabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41352-41360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Exogenous Supply of Glycine or Serine Enhances the Accumulation of Betaine in A. halophytica—A. halophytica synthesizes betaine from glycine via a three-step methylation (19Waditee R. Tanaka Y. Aoki K. Hibino T. Jikuya H. Takano J. Takabe T. Takabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4932-4942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because the betaine levels in betaine-accumulating organisms are very high, it has been suggested that the genes involved in betaine synthesis are well-organized so that the supply of precursors for betaine synthesis is not limited. To investigate whether the precursor glycine is a limiting factor for betaine synthesis in A. halophytica, the levels of free amino acids were measured. Under salt-stress conditions, the levels of free glycine and serine in the cells markedly decreased (data not shown). An exogenous supply of glycine did not alter the betaine level in A. halophytica at low salinity (0.5 m NaCl), but it strikingly increased the betaine level at high salinity (1.5 m NaCl) (Fig. 1A). Similar results were observed when serine was supplied (data not shown). These results indicate the level of glycine is a limiting factor for the accumulation of betaine, even for the betaine-accumulating organism A. halophytica. In cyanobacteria, the importance of serine biosynthesis via a phosphorylated pathway has been suggested (24Colman B. Norman E. Physiologia Plantarum. 1997; 100: 133-136Crossref Google Scholar). We therefore measured the PGDH activity in A. halophytica. As shown in Fig. 1B, PGDH activity of A. halophytica cells increased about 1.5–2.3-fold upon the increase of salinity from 0.5 to 2.5 m NaCl. Cloning and Biochemical Characterization of ApPGDH—The PGDH gene has not yet been isolated from cyanobacteria. Shot-gun cloning of the A. halophytica genome revealed the presence of a single candidate gene that has high homology to the PGDHs. The putative gene was isolated and sequenced. It revealed that the product for ApPGDH consists of 526 amino acids with a molecular mass of 56,410 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of ApPGDH is highly homologous to the putative PGDH from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (GenBank™ accession no. NP441198) (∼79% identity). ApPGDH is closely related to the PGDHs from Bacillus (31Sorokin A. Zumstein E. Azevedo V. Erlich D. Serror P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), Arabidopsis (22Ho C.L. Noji M. Saito M. Saito K. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 323: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (38–44% identity), but forms a family distinct from E. coli (33Tobey K.L. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12179-12183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and yeast PGDHs (GenBank P40054) (34Albers E. Laize V. Blomberg A. Hohmann S. Gustafsson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10264-10272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (32∼36% identity). The ApPGDH protein consists of three distinct domains: nucleotide binding, substrate binding, and regulatory domains as well as a long C-terminal domain like the Arabidopsis and mammal PGDHs (22Ho C.L. Noji M. Saito M. Saito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 397-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Achouri Y. Rider M.H. Van Schaftingen E. Robbi M. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). ApPGDH could be expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells in an active form. The recombinant enzyme was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and ion exchange column chromatography. The polypeptide chain of ApPGDH has a molecular mass of 57 kDa, calculated by SDS-PAGE (data not shown), which is consistent with the molecular mass deduced from the DNA sequence. Gel filtration chromatography suggests that ApPGDH associates as a tetrameric protein (data not shown). The substrates of ApPGDH were 3-PGA and PHP. Although the E. coli PGDH has also been shown to catalyze the oxidation/reduction reaction between α-ketoglutarate and hydroxyglutarate (37Zhao G. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), ApPGDH did not catalyze this reaction. Kinetic parameters for the ApPGDH together with five other PGDHs from different organisms are shown in supplemental Table S1. The Km values of ApPGDH for 3-PGA and PHP were 0.90 and 0.15 mm, respectively. These values were lower than those of PGDHs from bacteria (33Tobey K.L. Grant G.A. J. Biol.

The activity of ApPGDH was not inhibited by substrate (0–200 μm PHP) when sufficient salt was added to the reaction mixture. Serine and 13 other amino acids at concentrations up to 20 mm in the reaction did not reduce or inhibit PGDH activity. Effects of various salts on the ApPGDH activity were carried out, and the results are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. Addition of salts, such as NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2, increased the ApPGDH activities in b"

Mdv1 has been proposed to act as an adaptor between Fis1 and Dnm1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that S. cerevisiae Fis1 binds directly to Dnm1 and to Mdv1. Two Fis1 regions have been previously implicated in Mdv1 recruitment: an N-terminal “arm” and a concave surface formed by evolutionarily conserved residues in the tetratricopeptide repeat domain. Perturbing either Fis1 region does not affect Mdv1 binding, but both regions influence Dnm1 binding. Fis1 lacking its N-terminal arm binds tightly to Dnm1, and binding is abolished by mutations to the Fis1 concave surface. The Fis1-Dnm1 interaction decreases more than 100-fold in the presence of the Fis1 arm, suggesting that the arm acts in an autoinhibitory manner to restrict access to the Dnm1 binding site on Fis1.

Mitochondrial morphology is proposed to be maintained by a balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission involving at least four dynamin-like GTPases: three in fusion (in humans Mfn1, Mfn2, and Opa1) and one in fission (in humans Drp1, also known as Dlp1). In mitochondrial fission, the dynamin-related GTPase is thought to polymerize at points of constriction on the mitochondria, a fraction of which result in membrane scission in a manner that may be similar to dynamin in endocytosis (3Shaw J.M.

Competing models exist for the temporal order of a Fis1-Mdv1-Dnm1 assembly, but in these models Fis1 plays a central role in recruiting proteins to sites of fission (3Shaw J.M. Nunnari J.

BioEssays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). These structures share a concave surface formed by evolutionarily conserved residues in the TPR-like domain that probably bind other proteins important in mitochondrial dynamics. However, these structures differ in the orientation of the N-terminal region of Fis1, which we refer to as the Fis1 arm. The arm is not part of the TPR-like domain and, in S. cerevisiae, contains an additional 8 residues not found in mammalian Fis1 sequences (40Suzuki M. Neutzner A. Tjandra N. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21444-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1). In the structure of S. cerevisiae Fis1 (40Suzuki M. Neutzner A. Tjandra N.

However, hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments show that the Fis1 arm is less structured than the TPR-like domain, suggesting that it could move aside to regulate access to a putative binding surface (40Suzuki M.

Here we show, using pull-down experiments with recombinantly expressed proteins, that the concave surface of the Fis1 TPR-like domain binds the dynamin-like GTPase Dnm1 and not Mdv1. Our results suggest a new model for the assembly of these proteins in which the conserved concave surface of the Fis1 TPR-like domain binds the dynamin-like GTPase and the Fis1 arm regulates access to this GTPase binding pocket. Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—DNA encoding S. cerevisiae Fis1 lacking the C-terminal 27 residues was subcloned into pET29b (EMD Biosciences) to give a gene product of the cytosolic domain of Fis1 with a C-terminal His6 tag (Fis1ΔTM-His). A similar Fis1 construct except with GST at the C terminus was created by subcloning DNA encoding GST from pGEX vector (GE Healthcare) into a pET29b vector containing Fis1ΔTM. A ΔN16Fis1-GST construct lacking the first 16 residues and replacing Leu17 with Met was created by cohesive end ligation and PCR (49Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Mutations in ΔN16Fis1-GST were created using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Fusion and mutant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and grown at 37 °C in Luria broth with kanamycin (30 μg/ml) to A600 of ∼0.7. Protein expression was with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 18 °C for 15-18 h. Cells harvested by centrifugation were resuspended in column buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Buffers for mutant and wild-type Fis1ΔTM-GST fusion constructs also contained 5 mm EDTA. Cells were lysed by French press or by sonication, DNase was added to 1 μg/ml with 10 mm MgCl2, and lysates were clarified by centrifugation. Proteins were isolated from the resulting supernatant by affinity chromatography using either glutathione or Ni2+ affinity beads (GE Healthcare). Sample purity was checked by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE and was typically greater than 90%. DNA encoding Mdv1 residues 1-302 lacking the WD repeat domain (Mdv1ΔWD) or residues 1-236 lacking both the WD repeat and coiled-coil domains (Mdv1ΔCC/WD) was subcloned into pMALc2x expression vectors (New England BioLabs) (Fig. 1A). For overexpression, E. coli Rosetta cells (EMD Biosciences) were transformed with the Mdv1-containing vector and grown at 18 °C in autoinducible Studier ZYP-5052 defined media (50Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4107) Google Scholar) containing carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) to A600 of ∼8.0. Harvesting and lysis was similar to the Fis1 constructs. Cell lysate was applied to an amylose affinity resin and eluted with either 1 m α-methylglucoside or 10 mm maltose. For both constructs, the purity was assessed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE and found to be typically greater than 90% homogeneous. However, the Mdv1ΔCC/WD construct was less homogeneous with degradation products that ranged from 20 to 40% of the parent protein based on quantifying immunoaffinity Western blots with anti-maltose-binding protein (MBP) antibodies. DNA encoding the full-length Dnm1 protein was cloned into pMALc2x expression vectors (New England BioLabs). For overexpression, E. coli Rosetta cells (EMD Biosciences) were transformed and grown at 37 °C in Luria broth containing kanamycin (34 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) to A600 of ∼0.7 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 18 °C for 16 h. The harvested cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4, and frozen until purification, which was similar to the MBP-Mdv1 construct using amylose affinity chromatography with elution by 1 m α-methylglucoside or 10 mm maltose. Purity of MBP-Dnm1 was assessed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE and found to be typically greater than 90% homogeneous. Recombinant Dnm1 appears to be properly folded, since its GTPase activity was similar to Dnm1 after cleavage of the MBP fusion tag (data not shown). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing, and the resulting isolated proteins were found to be at the expected molecular weight by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Protein-Protein Interaction Assays—For MBP-Mdv1 pull-downs, 2 μm protein was incubated with Fis1 constructs at the indicated concentrations at 23 °C for 2 h in 150 μl of 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4, buffer while rotating. For MBP-Dnm1 pull-downs, 1 μm protein was incubated with Fis1 constructs at the indicated concentrations at 23 °C for 2 h in 150 μl of 20 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4, buffer while rotating. For the pull-downs, 20 μl of slurry mixture containing glutathione-affinity beads (diluted 3:5 with buffer) were added to the mixture and rotated for an additional 30-60 min. The affinity beads were washed five times with the same buffer to remove nonspecific binding. Protein was eluted with 30 μl of buffer containing 50 mm glutathione, diluted into 4× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and a fraction was analyzed by a 10% SDS-PAGE with Western blot detection using commercially available anti-MBP (New England BioLabs), anti-GST (GE Healthcare), or anti-His (AbCam) tag antibodies. The Western blots were visualized by either the CN/DAB colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad) or with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) and quantified by densitometry using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences) software or a Typhoon 9410 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare). Protein-protein interactions were also confirmed by reverse pull-downs using amylose affinity beads (New England BioLabs) and elution with 50 mm maltose or with pull-down using Ni2+ affinity beads (GE Healthcare) and elution with 1 m imidazole. Control reactions were performed concurrently to ensure specificity of Fis1-Mdv1 interactions. No binding between MBP-Mdv1 constructs and GST, glutathione beads, or Ni2+ affinity beads was detected. No binding between Fis1-GST and MBP or amylose beads was detected. Fis1 appears to localize Mdv1 to sites of future mitochondrial fission that may arise from a Fis1-Mdv1 interaction, which has been observed in two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation studies suggesting a direct interaction (20Naylor K.

To test for a direct interaction, we attempted to recombinantly express and purify Mdv1 in E. coli for pull-down experiments with the cytosolic domain of Fis1. Various expression constructs of full-length Mdv1 did not yield soluble, folded protein (data not shown), but we isolated two constructs that had MBP fused to the N terminus of Mdv1 (Fig. 1). One construct lacked the WD repeat domain (MBP-Mdv1ΔWD), and another shorter construct lacked both the WD repeat and CC domains (MBP-Mdv1ΔCC/WD). Each of these Mdv1 constructs bound to Fis1-GST in pull-down experiments using GST affinity beads (Fig. 2A). In the reverse experiment using MBP affinity beads, MBP-Mdv1ΔCC/WD was able to pull down Fis1-GST (Fig. 2B). This interaction appeared to be the result of direct binding to Fis1, since control experiments showed that GST did not bind MBP or Mdv1 constructs, and Fis1 did not bind MBP (supplemental Fig. 2). A direct Fis1-Mdv1 interaction was also observed in a pull-down experiment using a Fis1 construct with a His6 tag and Ni2+ affinity beads (Fig. 2C). Thus, the NTE domain of Mdv1 binds directly to the cytosolic domain of Fis1 in agreement with several studies (20Naylor K. Ingerman E. Okreglak V. Marino M. Hinshaw J.E. Nunnari J. J. Biol.

In vivo mutagenesis experiments have implicated both the Fis1 arm and the conserved surface of the TPR-like domain in Mdv1 recruitment to mitochondria (40Suzuki M. Neutzner A. Tjandra N. Youle R.J.

Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To define the relative contributions of these regions for Mdv1 binding, we designed a mutant of Fis1 lacking the N-terminal 16 residues (ΔN16Fis1) and tested its binding to the Mdv1 domains with a GST pull-down assay. We reasoned that if Mdv1 bound into the concave surface of the Fis1 TPR-like domain as proposed (41Karren M.A. Coonrod E.M. Anderson T.K. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), then removal of the Fis1 arm would enhance Mdv1 binding, because the Fis1 arm occludes access to this conserved surface (Fig. 3, A-C). However, Fis1 binding to either Mdv1 construct decreased with the deletion of the Fis1 arm (Fig. 4). This decrease was small but reproducible and did not appear to arise from a decrease in folding of ΔN16Fis1, which was as folded as Fis1 by circular dichroism spectropolarimetry (supplemental Fig. 3). This decreased Mdv1 binding to Fis1 upon deletion of the Fis1 arm suggested that the arm may stabilize Mdv1 binding to an adjacent region. To test this idea, we attempted to disrupt the Fis1-Mdv1 interaction by site-directed mutagenesis of ΔN16Fis1. Point mutants of Fis1 residues that lie in the concave surface of the TPR-like domain (R77E, Y82E, I85E, and K89E) did not disrupt Mdv1 binding; nor did point mutants adjacent to the Fis1 arm (Q21E, Q28A, Q40A, N44A, Q112E) with the exception of I24K, which showed"

Two or more glycine insertions at each site completely abolished ATPase activity. The isomerization of phosphoenzyme (EP) intermediate from the ADP-sensitive form (E1P) to the ADP-insensitive form (E2P) was markedly accelerated, but the decay of EP was completely blocked in these mutants. The E2P accumulated was therefore demonstrated to be E2PCa2 possessing two occluded Ca2+ ions at the transport sites, and the Ca2+ deocclusion and release into lumen were blocked in the mutants. By contrast, the hydrolysis of the Ca2+-free form of E2P produced from Pi without Ca2+ was as rapid in the mutants as in the wild type. Analysis of resistance against trypsin and proteinase K revealed that the structure of E2PCa2 accumulated is an intermediate state between E1PCa2 and the Ca2+-released E2P state. Namely in E2PCa2, the actuator domain is already largely rotated from its position in E1PCa2 and associated with the phosphorylation domain as in the Ca2+-released E2P state; however, in E2PCa2, the hydrophobic interactions among these domains and Leu119/Tyr122 on the top of second transmembrane helix are not yet formed properly. This is consistent with our previous finding that these interactions at Tyr122 are critical for formation of the Ca2+-released E2P structure. Results showed that the EP isomerization/Ca2+-release process consists of the following two steps: E1PCa2 → E2PCa2 → E2P + 2Ca2+; and the intermediate state E2PCa2 was identified for the first time. Results further indicated that the A/M1 linker with its appropriately short length, probably because of the strain imposed in E2PCa2, is critical for the correct positioning and interactions of the actuator and phosphorylation domains to cause structural changes for the Ca2+ deocclusion and release.

In the catalytic cycle, the enzyme is activated by binding of two Ca2+ ions to the transport sites (E2to E1Ca2, steps 1 and 2) and then autophosphorylated at Asp351 with MgATP to form the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E1P, step 3), which can react with ADP to regenerate ATP in the reverse reaction. Upon formation of this EP, the bound Ca2+ ions are occluded in the transport sites (E1PCa2). The subsequent isomeric transition to the ADP-insensitive form (E2P), i.e. the loss of the ADP sensitivity at the catalytic site, results in rearrangements of the Ca2+-binding sites to deocclude Ca2+, reduce the affinity, open the luminal gate, and thus release Ca2+ into the lumen (steps 4 and 5). As an intermediate state in the EP isomerization/Ca2+-release process, E2PCa2 has been postulated (e.g. see Ref. 8Inao S. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 857: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), although this state has never been identified. Finally, the E2P hydrolysis takes place and returns the enzyme into an unphosphorylated and Ca2+-unbound form (E2, steps 6 and 7). The transport cycle is totally reversible, e.g. E2P can be formed from Pi in the presence of Mg2+ and the absence of Ca2+ by reversal of its hydrolysis, and the subsequent addition of high concentrations of Ca2+ to E2P reverse the Ca2+-releasing step and the E1P to E2P isomerization. The enzyme has three cytoplasmic domains as follows: the nucleotide binding (N), phosphorylation (P), and actuator (A) domains, and 10 transmembrane helices M1-M10 (Fig. 2). During the EP isomerization/Ca2+-release E1PCa2 → E2P + 2Ca2+, the A domain largely rotates (by ∼110°) parallel to the membrane and associates with the P domain (see Refs. 9Toyoshima C. Nakasako M.

The interactions of the A domain with the P domain in the E2P state occur at three regions (Fig. 2, semitransparent purple, blue, and orange on E2·MgF−4): i.e. at the T181GES loop with the residues of the P domain around Asp351; at the Val200 loop (Asp196-Asp203) with the polar residues of the P domain (Arg678/Glu680/Arg656/Asp660); and at the Tyr122-hydrophobic cluster formed by seven hydrophobic residues gathered from the A domain (Ile179/Leu180/Ile232), the P domain (Val705/Val726), and the top part of M2 (the A/M2 linker region, Leu119/Tyr122). The formation of the A-P domain interaction at the T181GES loop has been predicted to be critical for the loss of ADP sensitivity at the catalytic site, i.e. the E1P to E2P isomerization, by the structural and mutation studies (18Clarke D.M.

The mutations at the latter two interaction regions were shown not to inhibit the E1P to E2P isomerization but to markedly retard the subsequent EP decay (19Wang G. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J.

Its kinetics were consistent with the view that there is a Ca2+-releasing step from E2PCa2(E2PCa2 → E2P + 2Ca2+) before the E2P hydrolysis and that this Ca2+-releasing step is blocked and became the kinetic limit for the EP decay by the disruption of the A-P domain interactions at each of the latter two regions (19Wang G.

It is therefore very interesting to know how the motions and interactions of the A and P domains progress during the postulated successive steps E1PCa2 → E2PCa2 → E2P + 2Ca2+ as the key structural events in the energy coupling between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. In this respect, it is also critical to clarify and distinguish the structural roles of the three linkers connecting the A domain with M1′/M1, M2, and M3 (A/M1, A/M2, and A/M3 linkers). Tyr122/Leu119 involved in the aforementioned Tyr122-hydrophobic cluster is at the A/M2 linker region. The A/M3 linker, because of its strain, has been predicted to be important for the large rotation of the A domain in the EP isomerization (12Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 13Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Regarding the A/M1 linker, we recently found (23Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Wang G. Danko S. Iizuka H. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39197-39204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that its shortening by deletions of any single residues within this linker (Glu40-Ser48) blocks the E1P to E2P isomerization and the hydrolysis of the Ca2+-free form of E2P, whereas substitutions of any residues in this linker do not inhibit the function. Our results indicated that the A/M1 linker with its correct length critically contributes to the EP isomerization/Ca2+ release and to the E2P hydrolysis, and we pointed out the possible importance of this linker in the proper positioning of the A and P domains for their motions and association during these processes. Therefore, in this study, we further explored the structural roles of this linker and the structural events occurring in the processes by elongating this linker with insertion of glycines (see Fig. 2). Results demonstrated that the elongation of the linker markedly accelerates the E1PCa2 to E2PCa2 isomerization, strongly stabilizes E2PCa2 that possesses two occluded Ca2+ ions at the transport sites, and blocks the Ca2+ deocclusion and release from E2PCa2. Thus, for the first time, the intermediate state E2PCa2 was identified and trapped in this study. We were then able to characterize the structure of this state. Results revealed that the correct length of the A/M1 linker is critical for structural events in each of successive steps in E1PCa2 → E2PCa2 → E2P + 2Ca2+ and E2P + H2O → E2 + Pi, and they further suggested how the motions and interactions of the properly positioned A and P domains progress with the critical contribution of the linker to accomplish the successive structural events in these steps. Our study also revealed the importance of M1′ directly connected with the A/M1 linker likely for forming the base of this linker. Mutagenesis and Expression—The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was utilized for the insertions and substitutions of residues in the rabbit SERCA1a cDNA. The ApaI-KpnI restriction fragments with the desired mutation were excised from the plasmid and ligated back into the corresponding region in the full-length SERCA1a cDNA in the pMT2 expression vector (24Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The pMT2 DNA was transfected into COS-1 cells by the liposome-mediated transfection method. Microsomes were prepared from the cells as described previously (25Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The “control microsomes” were prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with the pMT2 vector containing no SERCA1a cDNA. The amount of expressed SERCA1a was quantified by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (26Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Suzuki H. Saino T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23910-23915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Expression levels of the wild-type SERCA1a and mutants examined in this study were 2-3% of total microsomal proteins, except a mutant 4950525354S for M1′ with serine substitutions of Leu49/Trp50/Leu52/Val53/Ile54, which showed markedly reduced expression (only ∼15-20% of the wild type). Ca2+-ATPase Activity—The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined at 25 °C in a mixture containing 1 μg of microsomal protein, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 1 μm A23187, 0.1 m KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.55 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0). The Ca2+-ATPase activity was obtained by subtracting the Ca2+-independent ATPase activity, which was determined in the presence of 5 mm EGTA without added CaCl2, otherwise as above. The ATPase activity/mg of expressed SERCA1a protein was calculated from the amount of expressed SERCA1a and the Ca2+-ATPase activity of expressed SERCA1a, which was obtained by subtracting the Ca2+-ATPase activity of the control microsomes from that of the microsomes expressing SERCA1a. This background level with the control microsomes was as low as 3% of the activity of microsomes expressing the wild-type SECRA1a. Formation and Hydrolysis of EP—Phosphorylation of SERCA1a in microsomes with [γ-32P]ATP or 32Pi and dephosphorylation of 32P-labeled SERCA1a were performed under conditions described in the figure legends. The reactions were quenched with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing Pi. Rapid kinetics measurements of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were performed with a handmade rapid mixing apparatus (27Kanazawa T. Saito M. Tonomura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1970; 67: 693-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), otherwise as above. The precipitated proteins were separated by 5% SDS-PAGE at pH 6.0 according to Weber and Osborn (28Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity associated with the separated Ca2+-ATPase was quantitated by digital autoradiography as described (29Daiho T. Suzuki H. Yamasaki K. Saino T. Kanazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The amount of EP formed with the expressed SERCA1a was obtained by subtracting the background radioactivity with the control microsomes. This background was less than 5% of the radioactivity of EP formed with the expressed wild-type SERCA1a. The amount of EP/mg of SERCA1a protein was calculated from the amount of EP thus obtained and the amount of expressed SERCA1a. Ca2+ Occlusion in EP—As described in Fig. 8 legend, the expressed mutant SERCA1a in microsomes was phosphorylated with ATP and 45CaCl2, and then the mixture was diluted by a “washing solution” containing excess EGTA and immediately filtered through a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane filter (Millipore). The filter was washed four times with 2 ml of the washing solution, and 45Ca2+ remaining on the filter was quantitated. The amount of Ca2+ specifically bound to the transport sites of EP in the expressed SERCA1a was obtained by subtracting the amount of nonspecific Ca2+ binding, which was determined by including 1 μm thapsigargin (TG) in the phosphorylation mixture, otherwise as above. This background subtraction is ensured by the fact that TG inhibits the Ca2+ binding at the transport sites and the EP formation (30Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The background level thus determined was ∼60% of the total amount of 45Ca2+ remaining on the filter when the maximum amount of EP was present (i.e. at the zero time of EP decay in Fig. 8). It should be noted that the specifically bound Ca2+ in EP thus determined represents the occluded one because it is not released even after the extensive washing by EGTA. The Ca2+ occluded/mg of expressed SERCA1a protein was calculated from the amount of expressed SERCA1a and the amount of occluded Ca2+. The Ca2+ occlusion resulted from Ca2+ binding to E2P in the reverse reaction of the Ca2+-release process was also determined. In this case, E2P was first formed from Pi in the absence of Ca2+, and 45Ca2+ was then added to E2P otherwise as described in Fig. 10 legend, and the amount of occluded 45Ca2+ was determined as above.FIGURE 10Accessibility of luminal Ca2+ in E2P formed from Pi without Ca2+. Microsomes expressing the wild type (A) or the mutant 2Gi-46/47 (B) were phosphorylated with 32Pi in 2.5 μl of a mixture as described in Fig. 9. The mixture was then cooled and diluted 100-fold at 0 °C with 247.5 μl of a solution containing various concentrations of CaCl2 in 1 μm A23187, 101 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 7 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0) to give the final Ca2+ concentrations as indicated with different symbols. The amount of EP remaining at the indicated time after this Ca2+ addition was determined and shown as percentage of the amount of EP at zero time, which was determined immediately before the Ca2+ addition. The EP decay occurred in two phases. The first and rapid phase completed within a few seconds corresponding to the hydrolysis of E2P without bound Ca2+ (see Fig. 7). Essentially the same results were observed in the mutants 3Gi-46/47 and 4Gi-46/47 (data not shown) as in 2Gi-46/47. C, content of EP in the slow and second phase at each Ca2+ concentration was obtained by extrapolating to the zero time and plotted versus the Ca2+ concentration. K0.5 values for the Ca2+ activation and Hill coefficients obtained by fitting to the Hill equation (solid lines) were 1.4 mm and 1.5 (wild type), 1.3 mm and 1.5 (1Gi-46/47), 1.2 mm and 1.4 (2Gi-46/47), 1.0 mm and 1.2 (3Gi-46/47), 0.9 mm and 1.4 (4Gi-46/47), as summarized in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Limited Proteolysis of Major Intermediates and Western Blot Analysis—Major intermediates and its stable analogs of the Ca2+-ATPase were produced and subjected to the structural analysis by limited proteolysis with trypsin and proteinase K (PrtK) as described in Fig. 12 legend. The digests were separated by 10.5 or 7.5% SDS-PAGE, according to Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), and blotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and then incubated with IIH11 monoclonal antibody to the rabbit SERCA1a (Affinity Bioreagents), which recognizes an epitope between Ala199-Arg505. After incubation with secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated), the bound proteins were probed using an enhanced chemiluminescence-linked detection system (ECL Plus, GE Healthcare). Miscellaneous—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the program Origin (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). Three-dimensional models of the enzyme were reproduced by the program VMD (33Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39018) Google Scholar). Ca2+-ATPase Activity—The specific Ca2+-ATPase activity of the expressed SERCA1a mutants was determined at saturating 50 μm Ca2+ and 25 °C and compared with that of the wild type (Fig. 3). Insertion of one glycine between Gly46 and Lys47 (1Gi-46/47) and between Pro42 and Ala43 (1Gi-42/43) within the A/M1 linker slowed the ATPase activity by ∼50%. Insertion of two or more glycines at each of these sites abolished the activity almost completely (2Gi-46/47 to 6Gi-46/47 and 4Gi-42/43). Thus, the elongation of the linker by the glycine insertion at the two different positions within the A/M1 linker exhibited the same inhibitory effects on the ATPase, indicating the importance of the correct length of this loop in the function. 3In this regard, we should describe the reasons why we chose the positions 42/43 and 46/47 for the insertions. First of all, to explore the importance of the length of the linker and to assign the effects of the insertions straightforwardly as those of the elongation of the linker, it is necessary or better to have insertions at two (at least) different positions. Then for the choice of the two, the positions approximately at one-third and at two-thirds of the length of the linker would be reasonable because the A/M1 linker, Glu40-Ser48 loop, is an extended loop without helical structure (see Fig. 2) and has no extensive interactions with other parts of the ATPase molecule (actually the substitutions of any single residues in this loop did not impair the function (23Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Wang G. Danko S. Iizuka H. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39197-39204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). Also, the two positions should be not too close to the junctions of the A/M1 linker with the A domain and with M1′ (and to the membrane lipids). This is to avoid possible disruption of the structures at the junctions. With these reasons, we chose the two insertion positions at 42/43 and 46/47, and we therefore distributed the two on the linker but did not position them very close to each other at the middle part or at either side of the linker. As a reason for the choice of glycine(s) as the amino acid for the insertions, we intended to minimize possible disruption of the extended loop structure of the linker and to avoid possible formation of side-chain interactions. The results in Fig. 3 of the mutants with the insertions at the two different positions therefore agree with the view that the observed effects are because of the elongation of the A/M1 linker. The kinetic analysis shown in this study further revealed that the properties of the mutants with the insertions at the two different positions are essentially the same. We then examined the possible effects of the 4-amino acidinsertion in the C- and N-terminal regions of the A/M1 linker: between Val53 and Ile54 on the helix M1′ and between Thr22 and Gly23 in the immediate vicinity of the Thr25-Tyr36 helix (see Fig. 2b). In the mutants 4Ai-53/54 and 4Ai-22/23, alanines were inserted (for M1′, we intended to minimize possible disruption of the helical structure). These mutants exhibited the high ATPase activity (Fig. 3) and the Ca2+ transport coupled with the ATP hydrolysis (data not shown). Thus the insertions at the adjacent regions of the A/M1 linker did not inhibit the activity. We inserted amino acids also in the immediate N-terminal region of the A/M1 linker, for example at His32-Leu33 and at Gly37-His38; however, the protein expression levels of these mutants were extremely low (less than ∼10% of the wild type); therefore, their functional analysis was not possible. We also investigated the possible importance of amphipathic property of the helix M1′ (Trp50-Glu58 in E1·AlFx·ADP or Leu49-Gln56 in E2·MgF−4), which is directly connected with the A/M1 linker and formed by kinking of M1. M1′ lies on the membrane surface, having hydrophobic residues aligned on the membrane side (Leu49/Trp50/Val53/Ile54) and the polar residues (Glu51/Glu55/Gln56/Glu58) on the cytoplasmic side (Fig. 2b). Therefore, the hydrophobic interactions of M1′ with the membrane core and/or its hydrophilic interactions at the membrane surface may possibly be important for function (13Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Previously the mutations of the single residues on the M1′ region were found to have almost no or only a slight effect on the activity (23Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Wang G. Danko S. Iizuka H. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39197-39204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Einholm A.P. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15888-15896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study, we therefore introduced the extensive nonconservative substitutions as follows: the serine substitution of all Leu49/Trp50/Leu52/Val53/Ile54 (4950525354S) and the alanine substitution of all Glu51/Glu55/Gln56/Glu58/Asp59 (5155565859A). The mutant 4950525354S exhibited the markedly reduced ATPase activity (17% that of the wild type), whereas the mutant 5155565859A exhibited a fairly high activity (70% that of the wild type). The results indicate that the hydrophobic interaction of M1′ with the membrane core may be important. EP Formation from ATP and the E2-E1Ca2 Transition—The amount of EP formed from ATP at saturating 50 μm Ca2+ was determined at steady state and 0 °C with 10 μm ATP under the conditions otherwise the same as those for the ATPase assay (open bars in Fig. 4). All the mutants formed EP with the amounts comparable with that of the wild type (3.31 ± 0.14 nmol/mg of the SERCA1a protein (n = 4)) except that the mutant 4950525354S exhibited a somewhat reduced amount. The Ca2+ affinity of the mutants in the E2to E1Ca2 transition was estimated by the Ca2+ dependence of the EP formation from ATP and was found to be nearly the same as that of the wild type (see the Ca2+ affinity and the Hill coefficient in Table 1). The mutant 4Ai-53/54 among those examined showed a slightly reduced affinity. We further found that the first-order rate constants of the E2to E1Ca2 transition (steps 1 and 2) in the examined mutants were nearly the same as in the wild type (Table 1). In this experiment, the enzyme was first preincubated in the absence of Ca2+ at pH 6, where the equilibrium between E1 and E2 is most shifted to E2 (35Pick U. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6120-6126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then the phosphorylation was initiated by the simultaneous addition of saturating Ca2+ and ATP. When ATP was added to the enzyme preincubated with Ca2+, otherwise as above, the EP formation was much faster in the mutants as well as in the wild type, and therefore the rates obtained above actually reflect the rate-limiting E2to E1Ca2 transition.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters determined for partial reaction stepsE2 to E1Ca2E1Ca2 to E1PCa2aThe rate of the E1PCa2 formation from E1Ca2 in the presence of K+ was very similar to that in the absence of K+ (see Fig. 5, A and C) and therefore not shown for simplicity.Loss of ADP sensitivityDecay of EPATPHydrolysis of E2PPiE2P to E2PCa2/E1PCa2Ca2+ affinityRateCa2+ affinityK0.5n(−)K+(+)K+(−)K+K0.5nμms−1%s−1%s−1s−1%s−1%s−1%mmWild type0.161.870.213(100)1.37(100)bNot determined because the accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP was low.0.34(100)0.0390(100)0.64(100)1.41.54Ai-22/230.181.650.292(137)1.30(95)bNot determined because the accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP was low.0.63(188)0.0613(157)1.07(169)2.21.11Gi-42/430.161.880.157(74)1.91(140)bNot determined because the accumulation of ADP-insensitive EP was low.0.53(156)0.0247(63)1.07(169)2.31.54Gi-42/430.131.730.1"

https://openalex.org/W1988806825,"10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) consists of two independent catalytic domains, N- and C-terminal, connected by a 100-amino acid residue linker (intermediate domain). Our previous studies on structural organization and enzymatic properties of rat FDH suggest that the overall enzyme reaction, i.e. NADP+-dependent conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and CO2, consists of two steps: (i) hydrolytic cleavage of the formyl group in the N-terminal catalytic domain, followed by (ii) NADP+-dependent oxidation of the formyl group to CO2 in the C-terminal aldehyde dehydrogenase domain. In this mechanism, it was not clear how the formyl group is transferred between the two catalytic domains after the first step. This study demonstrates that the intermediate domain functions similarly to an acyl carrier protein. A 4′-phosphopantetheine swinging arm bound through a phosphoester bond to Ser354 of the intermediate domain transfers the formyl group between the catalytic domains of FDH. Thus, our study defines the intermediate domain of FDH as a novel carrier protein and provides the previously lacking component of the FDH catalytic mechanism. 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) consists of two independent catalytic domains, N- and C-terminal, connected by a 100-amino acid residue linker (intermediate domain).

The subunit of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH 3The abbreviations used are: FDH, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase; 10-fTHF, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate; THF, tetrahydrofolate; ACPs, acyl carrier proteins; 4′-PP, 4′-phosphopantetheine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CIAP, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. ; ALDH1L1; EC 1.5.1.6) represents a single polypeptide consisting of three domains, with two of these domains possessing their own catalytic activities (1Cook R.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24728-24735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of FDH (residues 1–310) functions as 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-fTHF) hydrolase, converting 10-fTHF to tetrahydrofolate (THF) and formate (Fig. 1) (2Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10273-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain (residues 420–902) is an aldehyde dehydrogenase-homologous enzyme capable of NADP+-dependent oxidation of short chain aldehydes to the corresponding acids (3Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The two catalytic domains are separated by a short (∼100 residues) linker domain (intermediate domain). Although the physiological significance of the catalytic functions of the separate domains of FDH is not clear, the well established function of FDH is the conversion of 10-fTHF to THF in an NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase reaction (5Kutzbach C. Stokstad E.L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 793-798Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Scrutton M.C. Beis I. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Wagner C.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) suggest that this reaction proceeds in two steps: (i) hydrolytic removal of the formyl group from 10-fTHF and (ii) NADP+-dependent oxidation of formyl to CO2. The first step takes place in the N-terminal hydrolase domain, whereas the second step occurs in the C-terminal aldehyde dehydrogenase domain (2Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10273-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 3Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The connection between the two steps is the transfer of the formyl group between the two catalytic domains. However, the nature of such a transfer is not obvious. We have demonstrated previously that the two catalytic domains of FDH do not form close contacts in the absence of the intermediate domain (2Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10273-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the intermediate domain keeps the N- and C-terminal domains of FDH in close proximity to each other and in the correct orientation to create an interface between the two domains and to allow the formyl group transfer between the two catalytic centers. In support of this, the engineering of FDH with limited flexibility within the intermediate domain, which presumably permanently uncouples the two catalytic domains, resulted in an enzyme with no 10-fTHF dehydrogenase activity (15Reuland S.N. Vlasov A.P. Krupenko S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22894-22900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the two domains have demonstrated, however, that the catalytic centers of FDH, the hydrolase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, are buried within their corresponding domains, so residues of one catalytic center cannot contact residues of the other catalytic center (17Chumanevich A.A. Krupenko S.A. Davies C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14355-14364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This implies that the direct transfer of the formyl group between the two centers is improbable and suggests a role for the intermediate domain in the transfer of the substrate between the catalytic centers. Several mechanisms for channeling of a substrate within an FDH molecule could be envisioned. If the formyl group moves from the hydrolase catalytic center into the aldehyde dehydrogenase catalytic center by passive diffusion, the role of the intermediate domain could be in maintaining an orientation of the two centers that cages formyl and minimizes its loss to the outer solution. Another potential mechanism by which the intermediate domain can facilitate the transfer of a reaction intermediate between the catalytic centers is formation of a molecular tunnel, as has been proposed for a number of multidomain enzymes (reviewed in Refs. 19Huang X. Holden H.M. Raushel F.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 149-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar and 20Raushel F.M. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The fact that such tunnels are mostly hydrophobic in nature (20Raushel F.M. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) while the intermediate domain of FDH is noticeably hydrophilic (15Reuland S.N. Vlasov A.P. Krupenko S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22894-22900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) argues against such a mechanism. A third alternative for assisted intermediate transfer involves the employment of a prosthetic group, which can function as a swinging arm (21Lai J.R. Koglin A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14869-14879Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The canonical examples of such a transfer are pyruvate carboxylase (22Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (23Harris R.A. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Huang B. Wu P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2002; 42: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) (24White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M. Rock Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), which use biotin, lipoate, and 4′-phosphopantetheine (4′-PP), respectively, as prosthetic groups. The NMR structure of the intermediate domain of human FDH (Protein Data Bank code 2CQ8) demonstrates an ACP-like fold (21Lai J.R. Koglin A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14869-14879Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this study, we evaluated the sequence and structure similarity between the intermediate domain of rat FDH and carrier proteins with a 4′-PP prosthetic group (see Fig. 2). We also provide evidence that the intermediate domain of rat FDH is covalently modified by 4′-PP and that this prosthetic group transfers formyl from the hydrolase catalytic center to the aldehyde dehydrogenase catalytic center during the FDH-catalyzed 10-fTHF dehydrogenase reaction. Protein Expression and Purification—Rat FDH was expressed in either Escherichia coli or insect cells using a baculovirus expression system as we described previously (18Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Krupenko S.A. Horstman D.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It was purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized 5-fTHF-Sepharose, followed by size-exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-300. If necessary, additional purification was done by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Mono Q column as described (25Krupenko S.A. Horstman D.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The S354A mutant of FDH was expressed in insect cells and purified by the same procedure as used for the wild-type enzyme. The intermediate domain of rat FDH was expressed in E. coli and purified from inclusion bodies by size-exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 (15Reuland S.N. Vlasov A.P. Krupenko S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22894-22900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Assay of Enzyme Activity—The hydrolase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and 10-fTHF dehydrogenase activities of FDH were evaluated spectrophotometrically as described previously (3Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hydrolase and 10-fTHF dehydrogenase activities were measured using 10-formyldideazafolate as a substrate, with the assays for dehydrogenase activity containing additionally 100 μm NADP+. The monitored increase in absorbance at 295 nm (the characteristic spectrum maximum for the reaction product, dideazafolate) was used to calculate the specific activity. All assays were carried out at 30 °C in a 1-cm quartz cuvette using a Shimadzu 2401PC double-beam spectrophotometer. Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was evaluated by assaying propanal oxidation in the presence of FDH and NADP+. The reduction of NADP+ to NADPH measured at 340 nm (the characteristic spectrum maximum for the reduced form of the coenzyme) provided the reaction rate for the aldehyde oxidation. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The S354A mutant of rat FDH was generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) as we described previously (13Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35777-35784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 14Krupenko S.A. Vlasov A.P. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24030-24037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Reactivation of FDH Expressed in E. coli—Purified recombinant rat FDH expressed in E. coli (50 μl of a 2 mg/ml solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) was incubated with 2 μl of 5 mm coenzyme A solution in the presence and absence of 50 or 100 μl of lysate from Sf9 insect cells. The cell lysate was obtained by mechanical disruption of a suspension (1.0 ml) of 10 × 106 cells in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using a Dounce homogenizer for 2 min. 200 μl of glycerol was then added to the homogenate, and insoluble content was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Synthesis of a Fluorescent Reporter—A fluorescent reporter was synthesized according to a published procedure (26La Clair J.J. Foley T.L. Schegg T.R. Regan C.M. Burkart M.D. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 100 μl of a solution of fluorescein maleimide (7 mg in 0.7 ml of Me2SO) was mixed with 2 ml of 0.1 m of MES (pH 6.0) containing 3.8 mg of coenzyme A and kept on ice for 30 min, followed by incubation for 10 min at room temperature. Complete conversion of coenzyme A into the fluorescent reporter was verified by TLC (5:2:4 (v/v) butanol/acetic acid/water). Non-reacted fluorescein maleimide was quenched by the addition of 40 μl of0.5 m dithiothreitol in water. The solution was used directly for protein labeling. It was stable upon freezing for at least 1 month. Labeling FDH with the Fluorescent Reporter—Purified FDH (50 μl of a 2.0 mg/ml solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8)) was incubated with 50 or 100 μl of lysate from Sf9 cells and 10 μl of the fluorescent reporter mixture for 3 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, 10 μl of this solution was mixed with 10 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (4% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 4% glycerol, and 0.01% bromochlorophenol blue in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immediately following electrophoresis, the gel was imaged under UV light irradiation and then stained with Coomassie Blue. Labeling FDH with Fluorescein Maleimide—1 mg of FDH in 1 ml of phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was incubated with 25 μl of a stock solution of fluorescein maleimide (Pierce) in Me2SO (20 mg/ml) at room temperature for 3 h. Non-reacted fluorescein maleimide was quenched by the addition of 25 μl of 100 mm dithiothreitol and removed by gel filtration on a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare). Treatment with Alkaline Phosphatase—Purified wild-type FDH or its S354A mutant (∼1 mg) was incubated with 20 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP; New England Biolabs) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 24 h. The protein component was then separated by filtration on a Centriprep cartridge with molecular mass cutoff of 3000 Da (Millipore Corp.). The treated FDH was evaluated for all three catalytic activities as described above. The low molecular mass filtrate was concentrated and subjected to HPLC on a C18 column. HPLC—The concentrated low molecular mass filtrate was diluted with 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.8) at a 1:1 ratio, and 20 μl was loaded onto a Microsorb-MV C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5-μm diameter particles; Rainin) equilibrated with the same buffer. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–60%) in the above buffer over 60 min. Chromatography was carried out on a Waters 515 dual-pump solvent delivery system at a flow rate of 1 ml/min; peaks were monitored at 224 nm using a Waters 2487 dual-wavelength absorbance detector. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) Mass Spectrometry—Fractions corresponding to peaks observed upon HPLC separation were analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. A MALDI time-of-flight Altoflex Smartbeam instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) was used in linear mode to detect average ion masses. Samples were prepared by mixing 1 part of a sample solution (0.5 μl) with 1 part of matrix (5 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 50% ethanol) on the sample plate and allowed to air dry prior to analysis. Experiments were performed at the Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry Facility of the Medical University of South Carolina. FDH Treated with Alkaline Phosphatase Lacks 10-fTHF Dehydrogenase Activity—4′-PP is bound to ACP by a phosphodiester bond, which can be hydrolyzed by the action of a phosphodiesterase, resulting in the removal of the 4′-PP group (27Thomas J. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34675-34683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To study whether the FDH intermediate domain has the same type of modification as ACPs, we treated fully active rat FDH expressed in insect cells with CIAP. Alkaline phosphatases in general have been shown to possess phosphodiesterase activity (28Rezende A.A. Pizauro J.M. Ciancaglini P. Leone F.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29O'Brien P.J. Herschlag D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5691-5699Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 30Zalatan J.G. Herschlag D.

Therefore, we suggested that CIAP is also capable of such an activity and will hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond between FDH and 4′-PP. Indeed, we observed that the treatment with alkaline phosphatase completely deprived FDH of 10-fTHF dehydrogenase activity, whereas the treated enzyme was still capable of 10-fTHF hydrolase activity and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (Table 1).TABLE 1Activity of FDH Activity is shown as a percent of the corresponding activity of recombinant wild-type (WT) FDH expressed in insect cells.

To study the role of this residue in FDH function, we expressed the S354A mutant enzyme. The mutant enzyme was expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system and purified to near homogeneity by the same procedure as used for the wild-type enzyme (16Reuland S.N. Vlasov A.P. Krupenko S.A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1076-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Assay of the activities of the mutant enzyme revealed that it possesses hydrolase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities similar to those of wild-type FDH (Table 1). In contrast, the mutant did not produce a noticeable level of 10-fTHF dehydrogenase activity (Table 1). Reactivation of FDH Expressed in E. coli—We observed previously that rat FDH expressed in E. coli lacked the dehydrogenase activity toward 10-fTHF, whereas the two other activities, hydrolase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, residing in specific domains, remained. 4S. A. Krupenko, unpublished data. These results were initially explained by the lack of ability of E. coli to fold FDH into a functional enzyme. However, if FDH requires a modification of its intermediate domain, it is possible that the enzyme expressed in bacteria is inactive because of the lack of specific enzymes in E. coli capable of modifying FDH with 4′-PP. This was found to be the case: incubation of FDH expressed in E. coli with lysates of insect cells in the presence of CoA (CoA is a source of 4′-PP for ACP (24White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M. Rock Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar)) restored 10-fTHF dehydrogenase activity (Table 1). Similar results were obtained in experiments with lysates from human A549 cells (data not shown). To confirm that activation of FDH proceeds through a modification of Ser354, we expressed S354A mutant FDH in E. coli and subjected it to the same procedure. These experiments revealed that this mutant was not reactivated into a functional 10-fTHF dehydrogenase (Table 1). Fluorescent Labeling of FDH—Further evidence of the covalent modification of FDH at Ser354 in the presence of CoA came from our experiments with a fluorescent reporter synthesized according to a published procedure (26La Clair J.J. Foley T.L. Schegg T.R. Regan C.M. Burkart M.D. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this reporter, the fluorescent label fluorescein maleimide was attached to a 4′-PP part of CoA through the sulfhydryl group (Fig. 3A). This reporter allows the fluorescent labeling of proteins undergoing 4′-PP modification (26La Clair J.J. Foley T.L. Schegg T.R. Regan C.M. Burkart M.D. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as illustrated in Fig. 3B. We incubated purified recombinant FDH or its intermediate domain expressed in E. coli (both presumably unmodified at Ser354) with the reporter and lysates from Sf9 insect cells and subjected the mixture to SDS-PAGE. These experiments clearly demonstrated incorporation of the fluorescent label into both FDH and its intermediate domain (Fig. 3, C and F). In contrast, the S354A mutant was not labeled under the same conditions (Fig. 3D), indicating that this serine is a modification site. We further used insect cell-expressed FDH, possessing 10-fTHF dehydrogenase activity, as a target for modification by this reporter. We failed to observe modification of FDH with fluorescently labeled 4′-PP (Fig. 3E), presumably because the enzyme is already fully modified with 4′-PP. We also used fluorescein maleimide to modify sulfhydryl groups of insect cell-expressed FDH. Because this enzyme is a functional 10-fTHF dehydrogenase, we expected that it bears a 4′-PP prosthetic group with a sulfhydryl group accessible for modification. The labeled protein, separated from non-reacted fluorescein maleimide, was then treated with CIAP to release components bound to the protein through a phosphodiester bond. The released low molecular mass components were separated from the protein by passage through a 3000-Da cutoff filtration cartridge. In a control experiment, labeled protein untreated with CIAP was subjected to the same procedure. We observed strong fluorescence of the filtrate in the case of phosphatase-treated FDH, whereas no fluorescence was seen in the control untreated sample. In contrast, S354A mutant FDH did not produce labeled low molecular mass components in similar experiments. This further confirmed that a sulfhydryl-containing cofactor is bound to Ser354 of FDH through a phosphodiester bond. Mass Spectrometry Analysis of FDH Modification—We analyzed the molecular mass of the modifying group of FDH by MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The fact that treatment with CIAP completely deprived the enzyme of 10-fTHF dehydrogenase activity indicates that the essential non-protein cofactor was removed from the protein core by this treatment. We separated the cofactor from the protein moiety by concentrating the mixture on a filter with a 3000-Da molecular mass cutoff and subjected the low molecular mass content, after passage through the filter, to HPLC on a C18 column. The chromatography produced two major peaks with retention times of 17.5 and 49 min, respectively. The MALDI time-of-flight analysis revealed that the main component in the first peak has a molecular mass of 550.60 Da, whereas the main component in the second peak has a molecular mass of 360.08 Da (Fig. 4). The molecular mass of the latter corresponds well to the calculated molecular mass of 4′-PP, 358.33 Da. As for the first peak, we suggest that its main component represents an oxidized form (dimerized via a disulfide bond) of the two pantetheine residues, produced by removal of phosphate from 4′-PP by CIAP. The calculated molecular mass of such a dimer is 552 Da. As a control, both FDH expressed in E. coli and the S354A mutant expressed in insect cells were subjected to the same procedure. None of the proteins yielded corresponding peaks after HPLC (data not shown). The amino acid sequence of FDH suggests that the enzyme is a natural fusion of at least two unrelated genes. Although the relationships of the N-terminal domain with other enzymes that use 10-fTHF as a substrate, as well as the nature of the C-terminal domain as an aldehyde dehydrogenase family member, were apparent, the origin of the linker between the two domains remained unclear. Indeed, this domain does not have an extensive sequence similarity to known proteins. However, recent analysis of the sequence of rat FDH using a data base of protein domains (www.expasy.org/prosite/) suggested that the intermediate domain is a member of the group of carrier proteins with a 4′-PP swinging arm. These carrier proteins are components of multienzyme complexes involved in fatty acid, polyketide, and non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis (21Lai J.R. Koglin A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14869-14879Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Their specific feature is a 4′-PP component covalently attached to a conserved serine residue through a phosphodiester bond (24White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M. Rock Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Another enzyme with a 4′-PP modification is α-aminoadipate reductase, a component of lysine synthesis specific to fungi (32Guo S. Evans S.A. Wilkes M.B. Bhattacharjee J.K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7120-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The 4′-PP arm is a crucial functional component of the carrier proteins: it holds a growing chain of fatty acids, polyketides, or peptides during the reaction. In mammals, there is only one known metabolic pathway (fatty acid biosynthesis) that requires this type of carrier proteins. Structures of several carrier proteins have been solved (reviewed in Refs. 21Lai J.R. Koglin A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14869-14879Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.M. Rock Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, and 31Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). They demonstrate a similar fold, a distorted four-helix bundle with the 4′-PP-bearing conserved serine located in the loop. The NMR structure of the intermediate domain of human FDH has recently become available (Protein Data Bank code 2CQ8). The model of the rat enzyme, which was used in our studies, was built using the human enzyme as a template. The overall fold of the intermediate domain is similar to that of other carrier proteins (33Kim Y. Prestegard J.H. Proteins. 1990; 8: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 34Crump M.P. Crosby J. Dempsey C.E. Parkinson J.A. Murray M. Hopwood D.A. Simpson T.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6000-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 35Weber T. Baumgartner R. Renner C. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 407-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), with the best superposition (root mean square deviation between C-α atoms of 4.1 Å) with the peptidyl carrier protein domain of non-ribosomal tyrocidine synthase III from Bacillus brevis (Fig. 2B) (35Weber T. Baumgartner R. Renner C. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 407-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Most of the structural deviations among the carrier proteins are due to shifted positions of the four α-helixes within each structure, as well as alterations in the length and conformation of the loops connecting the α-helixes. But the position of the conserved serine residue that bears the 4′-PP arm is very close in all structures (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, despite the overall structural similarity, the amino acid sequence conservation within this group is not so profound: the multiple sequence alignment of the four carrier proteins from different pathways (non-ribosomal peptide synthase, polyketide synthase, ACP, and the intermediate domain) revealed only two strictly conserved residues, other than the serine modified by 4′-PP. This study has demonstrated that the intermediate domain of FDH is a functional analog of carrier proteins with the 4′-PP arm. This prosthetic group must be attached to the conserved serine residue (Ser354) in order for FDH to be catalytically active. Elimination of this modification (in our experiments via replacement of the serine with alanine) resulted in FDH lacking 10-fTHF dehydrogenase activity. Furthermore, the treatment of active FDH with alkaline phosphatase deprived the enzyme of 10-fTHF dehydrogenase activity. Such a treatment also yielded a compound with a molecular mass that corresponds to the molecular mass of 4′-PP. To complement these experiments, incubation of catalytically inactive FDH expressed in E. coli with lysates of mammalian or insect cells and CoA as a source of 4′-PP restored the enzyme activity. Incorporation of 4′-PP into FDH as well as into the intermediate domain itself was further confirmed in our in vitro experiments with a fluorescent reporter. Thus, it becomes apparent that the intermediate domain uses a 4′-PP arm to transfer a formyl group between the two catalytic centers (Fig. 5). Atomic level details concerning the interface between FDH domains and the nature of their interaction with the 4′-PP swinging arm await the crystal structure of full-length FDH. But because the 4′-PP arm extends to ∼20 Å in length (21Lai J.R. Koglin A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14869-14879Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), both the hydrolase and aldehyde dehydrogenase catalytic centers of FDH are well within reach, as can be concluded from their respective crystal structures (17Chumanevich A.A. Krupenko S.A. Davies C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14355-14364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 36Kursula P. Schuler H. Flodin S. Nilsson-Ehle P. Ogg D.J. Savitsky P. Nordlund P. Stenmark P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1294-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The catalytic center of the hydrolase domain is relatively open (17Chumanevich A.A. Krupenko S.A. Davies C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14355-14364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 36Kursula P. Schuler H. Flodin S. Nilsson-Ehle P. Ogg D.J. Savitsky P. Nordlund P. Stenmark P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1294-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which perhaps facilitates easy access of the 4′-PP arm to the formyl group of the substrate. Moreover, two potential mechanisms could further facilitate access of the 4′-PP arm to the formyl group in the hydrolase catalytic center. In one of the mechanisms, a shift of the flexible loop bearing the catalytic residue Asp142 could expose formyl to the domain surface (17Chumanevich A.A. Krupenko S.A. Davies C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14355-14364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Another mechanism may involve larger scale rearrangements within the hydrolase domain making the catalytic center cleft more open (36Kursula P. Schuler H. Flodin S. Nilsson-Ehle P. Ogg D.J. Savitsky P. Nordlund P. Stenmark P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 1294-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In contrast, the aldehyde dehydrogenase active site is less accessible, with its key catalytic cysteine located at the end of a 12-Å deep substrate entrance tunnel (18Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the length of the 4′-PP arm is sufficient to bring the formyl group in close vicinity of this residue. Interestingly, the substrate entrance tunnel of the aldehyde dehydrogenase domain of FDH shares a characteristic with aldehyde dehydrogenases specific for larger aldehyde substrates, viz. a wide tunnel made up of amino acids with small side chains (37Moore S.A. Baker H.M. Blythe T.J. Kitson K.E. Kitson T.M. Baker E.N. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1541-1551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 38Lamb A.L. Newcomer M.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Apparently, such a wide tunnel is necessary to allow access of the 4′-PP arm to the active site. Our experiments have answered the previously unclear question of how the two functional domains of FDH communicate to merge the hydrolase and aldehyde dehydrogenase catalytic engines into one mechanism (Fig. 5). Notably, this study has identified the second metabolic pathway in higher organisms (in addition to fatty acid biosynthesis) that uses the 4′-PP prosthetic group. Interestingly, the two pathways, fatty acid biosynthesis and folate metabolism, are not closely related. Our finding also indicates that FDH requires post-translational modification to become a functional enzyme. A recently reported human 4′-PP transferase with broad specificity (39Joshi A.K. Zhang L. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33142-33149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) could be a candidate to carry out this modification. (It appears that there is only one 4′-PP transferase gene in the human genome (40Walsh C.T. Posttranslational Modification of Proteins. Roberts & Company Publishers, Englewood, CO2006Google Scholar).) Interestingly, FDH expressed in E. coli appeared to be unmodified, although E. coli possesses several 4′-PP transferases (41Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). These results might indicate that these transferases are not efficient toward large mammalian proteins. Alternatively, the lack of a typical consensus motif for 4′-PP attachment can make FDH an inefficient substrate. Indeed, the corresponding sequence of rat FDH (Fig. 2B) indicates mismatches with the consensus motif (41Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 42Schlumbohm W. Stein T. Ullrich C. Vater J. Krause M. Marahiel M.A. Kruft V. Wittmann-Liebold B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23135-23141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including two residues immediately up and downstream of the conserved serine. A third possibility to be considered is the activity of E. coli phosphodiesterase that removes the 4′-PP moiety from proteins (27Thomas J. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34675-34683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Post-translational addition of the 4′-PP arm to ACP occurs after the protein is fully folded (41Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Folded but unmodified FDH may occur if the modification process becomes deficient. Alternatively, hydrolytic enzymes, similar to a recently characterized ACP phosphodiesterase (27Thomas J. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34675-34683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), may also alter the extent of phosphopantetheinylation of FDH in the cell. Whatever the mechanism, FDH without its 4′-PP prosthetic group could function as a folate-binding protein. Interestingly, the folate binding function was originally proposed for FDH (43Cook R.J. Wagner C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is not clear at present whether FDH exists in the cell in an unmodified form. If it does, the distribution between catalytically functional and nonfunctional FDHs and the cellular conditions that affect this distribution would be of interest. Future studies should allow clarification of this matter."
https://openalex.org/W2011004105,"We recently reported that the pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin (Cn) by low concentrations of cyclosporin A increases osteoblast differentiation in vitro and bone mass in vivo. To determine whether Cn exerts direct actions in osteoblasts, we generated mice lacking Cnb1 (Cn regulatory subunit) in osteoblasts (ΔCnb1OB) using Cre-mediated recombination methods. Transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase, driven by the human osteocalcin promoter, were crossed with homozygous mice that express loxP-flanked Cnb1 (Cnb1f/f). Microcomputed tomography analysis of tibiae at 3 months showed that ΔCnb1OB mice had dramatic increases in bone mass compared with controls. Histomorphometric analyses showed significant increases in mineral apposition rate (67%), bone volume (32%), trabecular thickness (29%), and osteoblast numbers (68%) as well as a 40% decrease in osteoclast numbers as compared with the values from control mice. To delete Cnb1 in vitro, primary calvarial osteoblasts, harvested from Cnb1f/f mice, were infected with adenovirus expressing the Cre recombinase. Cre-expressing osteoblasts had a complete inhibition of Cnb1 protein levels but differentiated and mineralized more rapidly than control, green fluorescent protein-expressing cells. Deletion of Cnb1 increased expression of osteoprotegerin and decreased expression of RANKL. Co-culturing Cnb1-deficient osteoblasts with wild type osteoclasts demonstrated that osteoblasts lacking Cnb1 failed to support osteoclast differentiation in vitro. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the inhibition of Cnb1 in osteoblasts increases bone mass by directly increasing osteoblast differentiation and indirectly decreasing osteoclastogenesis.

Bone is a highly dynamic structure that is constantly renewing through a process called remodeling (1Karsenty G. Wagner E.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 389-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). This process is critical for maintaining healthy bones and is mainly controlled by the activities of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. The presence of these two opposing cell types with contrasting activities in close proximity requires tight regulation to maintain healthy and strong bones. Bone resorption is attained by the action of osteoclasts, which are specialized macrophages whose differentiation is primarily regulated by receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) 2The abbreviations used are: RANKL, receptor activator of NFκB ligand; OPG, osteoprotegerin; Cn, calcineurin; CsA, cyclosporin A; NFAT, nuclear factors of activated T cells; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DXA, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry; μCT, microcomputed tomography. and osteoprotegerin (OPG) (2Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts originate from multipotent mesenchymal progenitors that replicate as undifferentiated cells but have the potential to differentiate into different lineages of mesenchymal tissues including bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, and marrow stroma (3Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (18139) Google Scholar, 4Aubin J.E. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1998; 30-31: 73-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Osteoblasts control bone formation not only by synthesizing bone matrix proteins and regulating mineralization but also by orchestrating the process of bone resorption through the modulation of RANKL and OPG expression (2Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar, 4Aubin J.E. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1998; 30-31: 73-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the pharmacologic inhibition of calcineurin (Cn) by low concentrations of cyclosporin A (CsA) increases osteoblast differentiation and bone formation (5Yeo H. Beck L.H. McDonald J.M. Zayzafoon M. Bone (NY). 2007; 40: 1502-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that this response was associated with an increase in the expression and activation of Fra-2, an activator protein-1 family member that plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation (5Yeo H. Beck L.H. McDonald J.M. Zayzafoon M. Bone (NY). 2007; 40: 1502-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cn is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine-protein phosphatase that regulates several physiological processes (6Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Cn exists as a heterodimeric protein complex consisting of two subunits, the 61-kDa calmodulin binding, catalytic subunit A (CnA) and the 19-kDa Ca2+ binding, regulatory subunit B (CnB) (7Klee C.B. Crouch T.H. Krinks M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6270-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Three mammalian isoforms of CnA (α, β, and γ) and two B isoforms (1 and 2) have been identified. The isoforms CnAα,-β, and -B1 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas CnAγ and B2 are specifically expressed in the testis (8Shibasaki F. Hallin U. Uchino H. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The CnA subunit contains the phosphatase domain, a CnB binding domain, a calmodulin binding domain, and an autoinhibitory loop. In resting cells the autoinhibitory domain obscures the phosphatase domain and is displaced upon the binding of CnB and Ca2+/CaM to CnA, resulting in the full activation of Cn (8Shibasaki F. Hallin U. Uchino H. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT) are members of a family of transcription factors that are known to be dependent on Cn activation. In resting cells NFAT proteins are highly phosphorylated and reside in the cytoplasm. Upon Cn activation, NFAT proteins are dephosphorylated and translocate to the nucleus where they regulate the transcription of NFAT-dependent genes (6Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Cn and NFAT are key promoters of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption (9Zhu L.L. Zaidi S. Moonga B.S. Troen B.R.

In contrast, the role of Cn and NFAT in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation is not well defined. It has been reported that the Cn/NFAT signaling pathway is also a positive regulator of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation (13Koga T. Matsui Y. Asagiri M. Kodama T. de Crombrugghe B.

The conclusions of these reports were based on data from murine animal models where the Cn/NFAT signaling pathway was disrupted either globally and/or in multiple tissues and was not limited to differentiated osteoblasts. These reports did not consider that Cn and NFAT are also expressed in a variety of tissues such as vasculature, T-cells, skeletal muscles, chondrocytes, and adipocytes which can indirectly alter the bone phenotype of these animals (16Crabtree G.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 109: 67-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 17Horsley V. Pavlath G.K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In contrast to the notion that Cn/NFAT is a positive regulator of bone formation, we discovered that the pharmacologic inhibition of Cn by low concentrations of CsA increased osteoblast differentiation in vitro and bone mass in vivo (5Yeo H. Beck L.H. McDonald J.M. Zayzafoon M. Bone (NY). 2007; 40: 1502-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The increase in bone mass was associated with enhanced bone formation and a decrease in bone resorption (5Yeo H. Beck L.H. McDonald J.M. Zayzafoon M. Bone (NY). 2007; 40: 1502-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that Cn signaling negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation and bone mass. To examine our hypothesis and to determine whether Cn directly impacts osteoblast differentiation, we utilized Cre-mediated recombinase technology to create mice lacking the calcineurin regulatory subunit (Cnb1) specifically in osteoblasts. Our results demonstrate that a block in the Cn/NFAT signaling pathway, when restricted to osteoblasts, leads to an increase in bone mass by directly increasing osteoblast differentiation and indirectly decreasing osteoclastogenesis. Generation of ΔCnb1OB Mice—Mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of an osteoblast-specific human osteocalcin promoter (OC-Cre) were provided by Dr. Thomas L. Clemens (University of Alabama at Birmingham) (18Zhang M. Xuan S. Bouxsein M.L. von Stechow D. Akeno N. Faugere M.C. Malluche H. Zhao G. Rosen C.J. Efstratiadis A. Clemens T.L. J. Biol.

Cnb1f/f mice were crossed with OC-Cre mice to generate OC-Cre/ΔCnb1OB progeny, which were used in subsequent mating. All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. For mice genotyping, DNA was prepared from tail biopsies. PCR-based strategies were then used to genotype these mice according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Sigma). The sequences for the primers that were used for genotyping were previously published (18Zhang M. Xuan S. Bouxsein M.L. von Stechow D. Akeno N. Faugere M.C. Malluche H. Zhao G. Rosen C.J.

The animals that had a genotype of Cre−/-/Cnb1f/f were considered control, Cre+/−/Cnb1f/− were considered heterozygote, and Cre+/−/Cnb1f/f) were considered ΔCnb1OB. Histology and Histomorphometry—Tibiae and femora were harvested from 3-month-old male mice (control and ΔCnb1OB). Bones were fixed in 10% (v/v) buffered formalin, decalcified in EDTA, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and then stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Also, bones were fixed, embedded in methyl methacrylate, sectioned, and stained with Goldner’s Trichrome. A region of interest, an area at least 0.5 mm below the growth plate (excluding the primary spongiosa and trabecular-connected cortical bone), was selected and remained constant for all animals regardless of the shape of the section (5Yeo H. Beck L.H. McDonald J.M. Zayzafoon M. Bone (NY). 2007; 40: 1502-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Standard bone histomorphometry as described by Parfitt et al. (20Parfitt A.M.

Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and Microcomputed Tomography (μCT) Analysis of Bone—Non-cephalic bone mineral density (g/cm2) was determined by DXA, which was measured by a Lunar PIXImus densitometer (GE Lunar Corp., Madison, WI) (5Yeo H. Beck L.H. McDonald J.M. Zayzafoon M. Bone (NY). 2007; 40: 1502-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After euthanizing the animals, tibiae were removed and dissected free of soft tissue. The bones were then fixed in 10% (v/v) buffered formalin for 24 h and analyzed by a μCT system using the manufacturer's included three-dimensional analysis software (μCT 40, Scanco Medical, Basserdorf, Switzerland). The region of interest analyzed from each mouse was the metaphysis of the proximal tibia. The trabecular bone in the tibia was scanned using a 12-μm slice increment on 100 slices, starting 360 μm distal to the growth plate and extending for 120 μm (5Yeo H. Beck L.H. McDonald J.M.

Zayzafoon M. Bone (NY). 2007; 40: 1502-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice calvariae were subjected to three sequential digestions in an enzymatic solution containing 0.1% (w/v) collagenase (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) and 0.05% (v/v) trypsin containing 0.53 mm EDTA at 37 °C. Osteoblasts were collected from the second and third digestions. Cells were maintained in minimum essential medium Eagle-α modification (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Adenovirus-GFP and -Cre were purchased from Vector Biolabs (Philadelphia). At confluency, cells were infected for 48 h with adenovirus-GFP and -Cre at an multiplicity of infection of 100 (22Liu X.

Osteoblastic induction was performed by supplementing the culture medium with 5 mm β-glycerophosphate and 250 μm ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (5Yeo H. Beck L.H. McDonald J.M. Zayzafoon M.

Immunohistochemistry—Tissues were deparaffinized and rehydrated followed by antigen retrieval using 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 6. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched using 1% hydrogen peroxide. Samples were then blocked for 1 h in Fc receptor blocker (Innovex Biosciences, Richmond, CA). Anti-Fra-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted in Fc Blocker solution and applied to the sections overnight at 4 °C. Biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies were then used followed by incubation with avidin-biotin enzyme reagents. Finally, specimens were incubated in peroxidase substrate for 30 s. Tissues were counterstained in Gill's hematoxylin for 10 s, dehydrated, cleared, and mounted. Negative controls were processed alongside the examined tissue using rabbit IgG instead of the primary antibody. At least 10 randomly selected microscopic fields were examined using 10× and 40× objectives. Photos were taken using a Nikon digital camera (23Zayzafoon M. Abdulkadir S.A. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3662-3670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts/Osteoclasts Co-culture—Primary osteoclast precursor cells were isolated by flushing bone marrow cells from the long bones of 2-month-old control and ΔCnb1OB mice. Cells were plated and cultured overnight in minimum essential medium Eagle-α modification containing heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Suspended cells were collected and layered on a Ficoll (Amersham Biosciences) then centrifuged at 340 × g for 15 min at room temperature. Bone marrow macrophage precursor cells were then collected from the interface. Primary adenovirus-GFP and -Cre-infected Cnb1f/f osteoblasts (105/well) were co-cultured with bone marrow cells (106/well) in minimum essential medium Eagle-α modification containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10−7 m dexamethasone, and 10−8 m 1α, 25(OH)2D3-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in 24-well plates. Culture media were changed every 3 days for 10 days. At the end of the study cultures were stained for TRAP using a TRAP staining kit (Sigma) (24Feng X. Novack D.V. Faccio R. Ory D.S. Aya K.

Real-time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted by the Trizol method as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen) (5Yeo H. Beck L.H. McDonald J.M. Zayzafoon M. Bone (NY). 2007; 40: 1502-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). One μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed, and the equivalent of 10 ng was used for real-time PCR as previously described (25Zayzafoon M. Gathings W.E. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Expression of actin was used for the normalization of gene expression values. The sequences for the specific primers used in this study were previously described: alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, collagen I, osteoprotegerin, RANKL, and actin (21Zayzafoon M. Fulzele K.

Whole Cell Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (23Zayzafoon M. Abdulkadir S.A. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3662-3670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (23Zayzafoon M. Abdulkadir S.A. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3662-3670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Protein extracts (20 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Immobilon-P (Millipore Co.), using a Bio-Rad wet transfer system. Membranes were then blocked with TBS-Blotto B (Santa Cruz) for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated overnight with antibodies directed against calcineurin β-subunit (anti-CnB1, Sigma C0581), calcineurin A-subunit (anti-PP2BA, Santa Cruz, SC-9070), total NFATc1 (NFATc1, Santa Cruz, SC-7294), the C terminus of actin (actin, Santa Cruz, SC-1615), and the N terminus of Fra-2 (Fra-2, Santa Cruz, SC-604). Signals were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) (21Zayzafoon M. Fulzele K. McDonald J.M.

Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Enzyme Serum Measurements—Serum was collected from the blood of control and ΔCnb1OB animals immediately after euthanasia. OPG and RANKL serum levels were measured using the mouse OPG/TNFSRSF11B and mouse TRANCE immunoassay according to manufacturer’s protocol (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Statistical Analysis—All statistical analyses were performed using the Microsoft Excel data analysis program for Student's t test analysis. Experiments were repeated at least three times unless otherwise stated. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. or ±S.D. as indicated. To determine whether Cnb1 exerts direct actions in osteoblasts, we generated mice lacking Cnb1 in osteoblasts (ΔCnb1OB) using Cre-mediated recombination. Transgenic mice expressing the Cre recombinase driven by the human osteocalcin promoter were crossed with homozygous mice that express loxP-flanked Cnb1 (Cnb1f/f). To confirm that Cnb1 deletion in ΔCnb1OB mice is indeed specific to osteoblasts, we performed PCR analysis using a combination of primers that specifically detect floxed Cnb1 alleles (Cnb1f) and null alleles (Cnb1Δ). Genomic DNA was extracted from several non-skeletal tissues such as brain, kidney, lung, liver, heart, and muscle as well as skeletal tissues including calvarium, femur, and spine from the ΔCnb1OB offspring. Fig. 1A demonstrates that Cre-mediated recombination (Cnb1Δ) occurred exclusively in tissues that contain osteoblastic cells, whereas non-skeletal tissues retained the Cnb1-floxed alleles (Cnb1f). Non-osteoblastic cells in skeletal tissues such as chondrocytes, adipocytes, and myocytes also retained their Cnb1f alleles (Fig. 1A). We then assessed the specific deletion of Cnb1 in osteoblasts by examining the levels of Cnb1 protein in primary calvarial osteoblasts that were harvested from 1-day-old control, f/ΔCnb1OB, and ΔCnb1OB pups. Primary calvarial osteoblasts were cultured for 30 days in the presence of β-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid to induce osteoblast differentiation and ensure the activation of the osteocalcin promoter in vitro and, thus, the expression of Cre-recombinase. ΔCnb1OB osteoblasts completely lacked Cnb1 as compared with controls and heterozygotes (f/ΔCnb1OB) (Fig. 1B, left panel). Loss of one allele of Cn (f/Δ Cnb1OB) in osteoblasts resulted in a slight decrease in the dephosphorylation of NFATc1 demonstrated by a slower mobility shift of NFATc1 due to the increase in its phosphorylation and an increase in its intensity because of NFATc1 cytoplasmic accumulation in response to inactivation (Fig. 1B, left panel). Because of the potential compensation of other Cn isoforms in response of Cnb1 deletion, we examined the expression of the major Cn catalytic subunit (CnAα) as well as the dephosphorylation of NFATc1, which is dependent on Cn activation. The deletion of Cnb1 isoform (regulatory subunit) in osteoblasts did not affect the levels of the CnAα (catalytic subunit), and it was sufficient to inhibit the dephosphorylation of NFATc1 as demonstrated by the accumulation of highly phosphorylated NFATc1 proteins (slow mobility shift) in the cytoplasmic compartment (increase in intensity). This suggests that the deletion of Cnb1 in osteoblasts is not compensated for by other Cn isoforms (Cn Aα,Aβ,Aγ, and B2). Furthermore, protein levels of Cnb1, CnAα, and NFATc1 were not affected in non-osteoblastic tissues such as the liver (Fig. 1B, right panel). Taken together, these data confirm that the ΔCnb1OB mice represent a suitable model for determining the direct role of Cnb1 in osteoblasts on bone formation and bone mass. There were no gross abnormalities in the skeletal development of the f/ΔCnb1OB or ΔCnb1OB mice as compared with controls. To examine the effects of Cnb1 ablation in osteoblasts on bone architecture, tibiae from 3-month-old male ΔCnb1OB and control mice were compared by μCT analysis. Three-dimensional images revealed a pronounced increase in the trabecular bone volume in the ΔCnb1OB mice as compared with control mice using sagittal and transverse scanning of the metaphysis of the proximal tibia (Fig. 2A). There was no difference between heterozygote and control animals even though Cnb1 was somewhat deleted in these animals (data not shown). Non-cephalic whole body bone mineral density measured by DXA is significantly increased in the ΔCnb1OB mice as compared with control mice (Fig. 2B). This microarchitectural increase in trabecular bone volume was further substantiated by a decrease in the structure model index (Fig. 2C). This indicates the conversion of trabecular bone to plate-like rather than rod-like structures because of an increase in bone connectivity and a decrease in perforation. Static histomorphometric analyses of distal femora of 3-month-old male mice confirmed the μCT findings. Mutant mice that have had Cnb1 specifically deleted in osteoblasts demonstrated a 32% increase in trabecular bone volume/tissue volume, a 29% increase in trabecular thickness, a 10% increase in trabecular number, and a 17% decrease in trabecular separation when compared with controls (Figs. 2, D-G). The combination of these microarchitectural and histomorphometrical results indicates that Cnb1 in osteoblasts negatively regulates bone mass. These changes were limited to trabecular bone, as we did not find a statistical difference in the cortical bone thickness between ΔCnb1OB and control mice when measured by μCT histomorphometry (data not shown). The increased bone volume seen in the ΔCnb1OB mice was accompanied by an increase in bone formation measured histomorphometrically. We show dynamic changes in bone remodeling by injecting calcein twice at 7-day intervals before euthanizing the animals. The distance between two consecutive labels in the trabecular bone of the femur was dramatically greater in the ΔCnb1OB mice than in the controls (Fig. 3A, upper panel). Goldner's Trichrome staining showed that ΔCnb1OB mice had an increase in bone volume (green/blue) and newly formed bone (red) (Fig. 3A, lower panel). These parameters were quantitated using Bio-Quant image analysis system and demonstrated that ΔCnb1OB mice had an increase in the osteoid perimeter (131%), mineral apposition rate (12%), osteoblast surface (70%), and osteoblast number (68%) when compared with the values from control mice (Figs. 3, B-E). Furthermore, all of the bone mass and bone formation indices were similar between heterozygote and control animals (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the increase in bone mass in the ΔCnb1OB mice is associated with an increase in bone formation. To determine the role of Cnb1 in osteoblast differentiation, we first examined the levels of osteocalcin gene expression, which is a late marker of osteoblast differentiation. Primary ex vivo calvarial osteoblasts that were harvested from 1-day-old control, f/ΔCnb1OB, and ΔCnb1OB pups were cultured for 30 days in the presence of β-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid to induce osteoblast differentiation. The deletion of Cnb1 in primary osteoblasts significantly increases osteocalcin gene expression (220%) as compared with control and heterozygote mice (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we examined the effects of the in vitro deletion of Cnb1 in primary calvarial osteoblasts. Primary osteoblasts were harvested from mice carrying Cnb1 floxed alleles (Cnb1f/f) and then infected with either adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase (Cre+) or a"

Studies focus on the role of ValA3, which projects within a crevice between the A- and B-chains. Engineered receptor α-subunits containing specific protease sites (“midi-receptors”) are employed to map the site of photo-cross-linking by an analog containing a photoactivable A3 side chain (para-azido-Phe (Pap)). The probe cross-links to a C-terminal peptide (residues 703-719 of the receptor A isoform, KTFEDYLHNVVFVPRPS) containing side chains critical for hormone binding (underlined); the corresponding segment of the holoreceptor was shown previously to cross-link to a PapB25-insulin analog. Because Pap is larger than Val and so may protrude beyond the A3-associated crevice, we investigated analogs containing A3 substitutions comparable in size to Val as follows: Thr, allo-Thr, and α-aminobutyric acid (Aba). Substitutions were introduced within an engineered monomer. Whereas previous studies of smaller substitutions (GlyA3 and SerA3) encountered nonlocal conformational perturbations, NMR structures of the present analogs are similar to wild-type insulin; the variant side chains are accommodated within a native-like crevice with minimal distortion. Receptor binding activities of AbaA3 and allo-ThrA3 analogs are reduced at least 10-fold; the activity of ThrA3-DKP-insulin is reduced 5-fold. The hormone-receptor interface is presumably destabilized either by a packing defect (AbaA3) or by altered polarity (allo-ThrA3 and ThrA3).

Binding of insulin to its receptor is central to the hormonal control of metabolism.

Insulin is a small globular protein containing two chains, A (21 residues) and B (30 residues), derived from proinsulin (2Dodson G. Steiner D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In the pancreatic β-cell insulin is stored as Zn2+-stabilized hexamers within secretory granules (2Dodson G. Steiner D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The hexamers dissociate on secretion into the portal circulation, enabling the hormone to function as a Zn2+-free monomer. In this study we investigate structure-function relationships at position ValA3, a site of mutation associated with diabetes mellitus (3Nanjo K. Sanke T. Miyano M. Okai K. Sowa R. Kondo M.

Diabetes-associated mutations have been identified at three invariant sites as follows: ValA3 → LeuA3 (insulin Wakayama), PheB24 → Ser (insulin Los Angeles), and PheB25 → Leu (insulin Chicago). These variants exhibit impaired receptor binding but to different extents (4Shoelson S. Haneda M. Blix P. Nanjo A. Sanke T. Inouye K. Steiner D. Rubenstein A. Tager H.

Activities of LeuB25-insulin and SerB24-insulin are reduced by 100- and 6-fold, respectively. Whereas the low affinity of LeuB25-insulin is because of the nonplanarity of the variant side chain at the receptor interface (8Mirmira R.G. Tager H.S. J. Biol.

The non-negligible affinity of SerB24-insulin for the IR predicts near-native potency because of a compensating reduction in its rate of clearance from the bloodstream.

Because substitutions at B24 (but not at A3 or B25) impair the efficiency of insulin chain combination (P. G.

Introduction of photoactivable amino acids at specific sites in a protein by chemical synthesis provides a powerful method to map interaction surfaces (16Chowdhry V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 293-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). A limitation can arise, however, if the photo-probe is significantly larger than the native side chain it replaces, as in such cases the probe may extend beyond the native contact surface (17Bayley H. Staros J.V. Scriven E.F.V. Azides and Nitrenes. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1984: 433-490Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, although para-azido-Phe (Pap) 6The abbreviations used are: Pap, para-azido-phenylalanine; Aba, α-aminobutyric acid; DG, distance geometry; DKP-insulin, insulin analog containing three substitutions in the B-chain (AspB10, LysB28, and ProB29); DTT, dithiothreitol; 125I-TyrA14-labeled insulin, insulin labeled with 125I at Tyr14 of the A-chain; IR, insulin receptor; MS, mass spectrometry; NOE, nuclear Overhauser enhancement; Pmp, para-aminophenylalanine; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; RMD, restrained molecular dynamics; TEV, tobacco etch virus; PDB, Protein Data Bank; ID, insert domain; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 6The abbreviations used are: Pap, para-azido-phenylalanine; Aba, α-aminobutyric acid; DG, distance geometry; DKP-insulin, insulin analog containing three substitutions in the B-chain (AspB10, LysB28, and ProB29); DTT, dithiothreitol; 125I-TyrA14-labeled insulin, insulin labeled with 125I at Tyr14 of the A-chain; IR, insulin receptor; MS, mass spectrometry; NOE, nuclear Overhauser enhancement; Pmp, para-aminophenylalanine; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; RMD, restrained molecular dynamics; TEV, tobacco etch virus; PDB, Protein Data Bank; ID, insert domain; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. is similar in size to Phe or Tyr and so provides a commensurate probe at aromatic sites in insulin (such as TyrB16, PheB24, and PheB25) (14Kurose T. Pashmforoush M. Yoshimasa Y. Carroll R. Schwartz G.P. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29190-29197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Xu B. Hu S.Q.

Biol. 2004; 341: 529-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), extension of this strategy to sites containing smaller side chains may be confounded by probe-dependent non-native interactions. Substitution of ValA3 by Pap, for example, is predicted to alter the surface topography of insulin; modeling suggests that the photo-probe protrudes beyond the A3-related crevice (Fig. 1B). Whereas the side chain of ValA3 is contained within this crevice (Fig. 1A), the azido group of PapA3 (red ball in Fig. 1B) is predicted to project 3-5 Å beyond the hormone surface. An analogous limitation can arise in structure-activity studies of analogs containing small-to-large substitutions. Because LeuA3 protrudes beyond the molecular dimensions of ValA3, for example, the very low activity of insulin Wakayama could reflect steric clash at the hormone-receptor interface even if ValA3 itself were not directly engaged (Supplemental Material). This possibility is not excluded by the native-like crystal structure of LeuA3-insulin as a zincstabilized hexamer (20Wan Z.L. Huang K. Xu B. Hu S.Q. Wang S. Chu Y.C. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5000-5016Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Conversely, nonlocal structural perturbations may confound use of large-to-small substitutions as exemplified by segmental destabilization of the A1-A8 α-helix on substitution of ValA3 by Gly or Ser (21Olsen H.B. Ludvigsen S. Kaarsholm N.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Guo Z.Y. Tang Y.H. Zhang Z. Feng Y.M. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We describe here the contribution of ValA3 to the structure, stability, and function of insulin. The two methyl groups of ValA3 line the floor of an inter-chain crevice (red and yellow balls in Fig. 1A). Structure-activity relationships are first investigated through studies of insulin analogs containing A3 side chains similar in size to Val as follows: α-aminobutyric acid (Aba), Thr, and allo-Thr (Fig. 2). Although none of these side chains would be predicted (in the absence of nonlocal conformational change) to protrude from the crevice (Fig. 1C), on engagement with the IR the variant side chains might perturb the packing or polarity of the interface. To address these issues, the substitutions were introduced within an engineered monomer of high activity (DKP-insulin; see Ref. 23Hua Q.X. Hu S.Q. Frank B.H. Jia W. Chu Y.C. Wang S.H. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 390-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) to facilitate spectroscopic studies without confounding effects because of self-assembly. Although none of these substitutions perturbed the efficiency of disulfide pairing in insulin chain combination, each analog exhibits lower thermodynamic stability, presumably because of altered packing or solvation of the variant side chains. 1H NMR studies nonetheless demonstrate retention of a native-like A3 crevice without protrusion of the substituted side chains (as in LeuA3-insulin) or transmitted conformational changes (as in GlyA3 or SerA3 analogs; see Refs. 21Olsen H.B. Ludvigsen S. Kaarsholm N.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Guo Z.Y. Tang Y.H. Zhang Z. Feng Y.M. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Despite such structural similarities, receptor binding activities are lower than that of the parent monomer (DKP-insulin) but higher than that of LeuA3-insulin (24Kobayashi M. Takata Y. Ishibashi O. Sasaoka T. Iwasaki T.M. Shigeta Y. Inouye K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that ValA3 functions directly in receptor binding. The second part of this study focuses on photo-cross-linking. Because our initial studies of isosteric analogs suggested that ValA3 directly contacts the IR, we sought to map the site of photo-cross-linking between PapA3-DKP-insulin and the IR α-subunit. Through the use of engineered midi-receptors (25Brandt J. Andersen A.S. Kristensen C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12378-12384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) containing specific protease sites (26Henrichs T. Mikhaleva N. Conz C. Deuerling E. Boyd D. Zelazny A. Bibi E. Ban N. Ehrmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4246-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), evidence is presented that PapA3 contacts a 17-residue segment at the extreme C terminus of the α-subunit. Derived from the insert domain (ID), the same segment (residues 704-718 in the IR B-isoform; designated αCT) was shown previously to be a site of photo-cross-linking between a truncated PapB25 analog of insulin and the holoreceptor (14Kurose T. Pashmforoush M. Yoshimasa Y. Carroll R. Schwartz G.P. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29190-29197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This segment contains several conserved aromatic and aliphatic residues and so may provide a nonpolar docking site for ValA3 and PheB25. The importance of αCT in hormone binding has been demonstrated by Ala-scanning mutagenesis of the holoreceptor (27Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2439-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Whittaker J. Whittaker L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20932-20936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This study thus brings together total chemical synthesis with receptor engineering to define a key feature of the hormonereceptor complex. Nonstandard mutagenesis of insulin extends the repertoire of conventional site-directed mutagenesis, whereas construction of model midi-receptors facilitates biochemical characterization of photo-cross-linked complexes. These complementary approaches highlight the contribution of the A-chain to the function of insulin at a site of clinical mutation causing diabetes mellitus. To our knowledge, these findings represent the first characterization of a contact between the insulin A-chain and a cognate binding element of the insulin receptor. Synthesis of Insulin Analogs—The general protocol for solid-phase synthesis is as described previously (29Merrifield R.B. Vizioli L.D. Boman H.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5020-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In brief, 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin (0.6 mmol amine/g; Bachem, Inc.) was used as solid support for synthesis of A-chain analogs; N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-O-benzyl-threonine-PAM resin (0.56 mmol/g; Bachem, Inc.) was used for synthesis of a B-chain analog containing substitutions HisB10 → Asp, ProB28 → Lys, and LysB29 → Pro (designated the DKP B-chain). A manual double-coupling protocol was followed (30Hu S.Q. Burke G.T. Schwartz G.P. Ferderigos N. Ross J.B. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2631-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The p-NH2 moiety of para-amino-Phe (Pmp) was protected by a 2-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl group, which is stable during peptide synthesis. The PmpA3-A-chain also contained a biotin group attached to the ϵ-amino group of d-LysA1, a well tolerated substitution for GlyA1 (20Wan Z.L. Huang K. Xu B. Hu S.Q. Wang S. Chu Y.C. Katsoyannis P.G.

Chain recombination employed an S-sulfonated DKP-B-chain and S-sulfonated variant A-chains (∼2:1 by weight) in 0.1 m glycine (pH 10.6) in the presence of dithiothreitol (30Hu S.Q. Burke G.T. Schwartz G.P. Ferderigos N. Ross J.B. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2631-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Analogs were isolated from the combination mixture (32Chu Y.C.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11278-11285Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and purified as described (33Weiss M.A. Hua Q.-X. Jia W. Nakagawa S.H. Chu Y.-C. Hu S.-Q. Katsoyannis P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40018-40024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with essentially native yields. Electrospray mass spectrometry (MS) in each case gave expected values and in the photoactivable derivative verified conversion of Pmp to Pap (14Kurose T. Pashmforoush M. Yoshimasa Y. Carroll R. Schwartz G.P. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29190-29197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a control, a photoactivable analog was similarly prepared containing PapB16, which contacts the N-terminal L1 domain of the IR α-subunit (19Huang K. Xu B. Hu S.Q. Chu Y.C. Hua Q.X. Qu Y. Li B. Wang S. Wang R.Y. Nakagawa S.H. Theede A.M. Whittaker J. De Meyts P. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 529-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); this analog contains biotin linked to the B1 α-amino group. Purities were in each case >98% as evaluated by analytical reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. MS revealed no anomalous molecular masses. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were obtained using an Aviv spectropolarimeter (34Weiss M.A. Hua Q.-X. Jia W. Chu Y.-C. Wang R.-Y. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15429-15440Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Samples contained 25-50 μm DKP-insulin or A3 analogs in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4); samples were diluted to 5 μm for denaturation studies. Thermodynamic Modeling—Guanidine denaturation data were fitted by nonlinear least squares to a two-state model as described (35Sosnick T.R. Fang X. Shelton V.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 393-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, CD data θ(x), where x indicates the concentration of denaturant, were fitted by a nonlinear least squares program according to Equation 1, θ(x)=θA+θBe(-ΔGH2o0-mx)/RT1+ee-(ΔGH2o0-mx)/RT(Eq. 1) where x is the concentration of guanidine and where θA and θB are base-line values in the native and unfolded states. Base lines were approximated by pre- and post-transition lines θA(x) = θH2OA + mAx and θB(x) = θH2OB + mBx (36Pace C.N. Shaw K.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The m values obtained in fitting the variant unfolding transitions are lower than the m value obtained in fitting the wild-type unfolding curve (Supplemental Material). To test whether this difference and apparent change in ΔGu might be a consequence of an inability to measure the CD signal from the fully unfolded state, simulations were performed in which the data were extrapolated to plateau CD values at higher concentrations of guanidine; essentially identical estimates of ΔGu and m were obtained. NMR Spectroscopy—1H NMR spectra were obtained at 600 and 800 MHz under the following three conditions: (i) in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), (ii) in 20% deuteroacetic acid (pH 1.9) at 25 °C, and (iii) in D2O at pH 8.0 and 32 °C as described (37Hua Q.X. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5505-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 38Hua Q.X. Narhi L. Jia W. Arakawa T. Rosenfeld R. Hawkins N. Miller J.A. Weiss M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This range of pH and temperature conditions enables resonances that overlap in one spectrum to be resolved in another. In addition, use of acidic pH in a co-solvent facilitates analysis of amide resonances, some of which are attenuated at pH 7.0 as a result of base-catalyzed solvent exchange. The protein concentration was 1 mm in each case. Resonance assignments were based on two-dimensional NOESY (mixing time 80 and 200 ms), total correlated spectroscopy (mixing time 30 and 55 ms), and double-quantum filtered correlated spectroscopy spectra. Molecular Modeling—Structures were calculated by distance geometry and restrained molecular dynamics (DG/RMD) using X-PLOR (39Brunger A.T. XPLOR Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) as described (19Huang K. Xu B. Hu S.Q. Chu Y.C. Hua Q.X. Qu Y. Li B. Wang S. Wang R.Y. Nakagawa S.H. Theede A.M. Whittaker J. De Meyts P. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 529-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Geometries were monitored with PROCHECK (40Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar); solvent-accessible areas were obtained by using X-PLOR, and molecular cavities were calculated by using SURFNET (41Laskowski R.A. J. Mol. Graphics. 1995; 13: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Rigid-body models of PapA3- and LeuA3-insulin analogs were built using InsightII (Accelrys Inc., San Diego) and X-PLOR based on the structure of a T-state crystallographic protomer (2-Zn molecule 1; Protein Data Bank code 4INS). Biological Assays—Two types of receptor-binding assays were performed. Determinations were performed with 3-6 replicates; values are reported as mean ± S.D. (Table 1). The percentage of tracer bound in the absence of competing ligand was less than 15% to avoid ligand-depletion artifacts. (i) Activities of ThrA3-DKP-insulin and DKP-insulin were first measured relative to 125I-TyrA14-labeled human insulin using a human placental membrane preparation containing the IR (column 2 in Table 1) (33Weiss M.A. Hua Q.-X.

Use of the parent monomeric analog as tracer circumvents uncertainties because of the base-line activity of DKP-insulin. Relative activity is defined as ratio of dissociation constants obtained by nonlinear regression curve fitting. IM-9 human lymphocytes were grown in suspension as described (49De Meyts P. Bainco A.R.

https://openalex.org/W2094666580,"Mutations in matrilin-3 result in multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, which is characterized by delayed and irregular bone growth and early onset osteoarthritis. The majority of disease-causing mutations are located within the β-sheet of the single A-domain of matrilin-3, suggesting that they disrupt the structure and/or function of this important domain. Indeed, the expression of mutant matrilin-3 results in its intracellular retention within the rough endoplasmic reticulum of cells, where it elicits an unfolded protein response. To understand the folding characteristics of the matrilin-3 A-domain we determined its structure using CD, analytical ultracentrifugation, and dual polarization interferometry. This study defined novel structural features of the matrilin-3 A-domain and identified a conformational change induced by the presence or the absence of Zn2+. In the presence of Zn2+ the A-domain adopts a more stable “tighter” conformation. However, after the removal of Zn2+ a potential structural rearrangement of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif occurs, which leads to a more “relaxed” conformation. Finally, to characterize the interactions of the matrilin-3 A-domain we performed binding studies on a BIAcore using type II and IX collagen and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. We were able to demonstrate that it binds to type II and IX collagen and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein in a Zn2+-dependent manner. Furthermore, we have also determined that the matrilin-3 A-domain appears to bind exclusively to the COL3 domain of type IX collagen and that this binding is abolished in the presence of a disease causing mutation in type IX collagen. Mutations in matrilin-3 result in multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, which is characterized by delayed and irregular bone growth and early onset osteoarthritis. The majority of disease-causing mutations are located within the β-sheet of the single A-domain of matrilin-3, suggesting that they disrupt the structure and/or function of this important domain. Indeed, the expression of mutant matrilin-3 results in its intracellular retention within the rough endoplasmic reticulum of cells, where it elicits an unfolded protein response. To understand the folding characteristics of the matrilin-3 A-domain we determined its structure using CD, analytical ultracentrifugation, and dual polarization interferometry. This study defined novel structural features of the matrilin-3 A-domain and identified a conformational change induced by the presence or the absence of Zn2+. In the presence of Zn2+ the A-domain adopts a more stable “tighter” conformation. However, after the removal of Zn2+ a potential structural rearrangement of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif occurs, which leads to a more “relaxed” conformation. Finally, to characterize the interactions of the matrilin-3 A-domain we performed binding studies on a BIAcore using type II and IX collagen and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. We were able to demonstrate that it binds to type II and IX collagen and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein in a Zn2+-dependent manner. Furthermore, we have also determined that the matrilin-3 A-domain appears to bind exclusively to the COL3 domain of type IX collagen and that this binding is abolished in the presence of a disease causing mutation in type IX collagen.

Matrilin-3 has a modular structure comprising a von Willebrand factor A domain (A-domain), four epidermal growth factor-like domains, and a coiled-coil domain, which facilitates oligomerization (1Klatt A.R.

Mutations in the A-domain of matrilin-3 have been shown to result in some forms of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), an autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia characterized by short-limb dwarfism and early onset osteoarthritis (5Chapman K.L.

The majority of MATN3 mutations that cause MED are missense mutations found within the β-strands and are predicted to affect the folding of the A-domain (6Jackson G.C. Barker F.S. Jakkula E. Czarny-Ratajczak M. Makitie O. Cole W.G. Wright M.J. Smithson S.F. Suri M. Rogala P. Mortier G.R. Baldock C. Wallace A. Elles R. Ala-Kokko L. Briggs M.D. J. Med.

Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that mutant matrilin-3 protein is retained within the rough endoplasmic reticulum of cells and elicits an unfolded protein response (7Cotterill S.L.

Genet. 2005; 42: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This essentially renders biochemical and biophysical analysis of the effects of the mutations very difficult, because it is not possible to isolate these recombinant mutant proteins under non-denaturing conditions.MED is genetically heterogeneous and can also result in mutations in the genes encoding cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and type IX collagen (COL9A1, COL9A2, and COL9A3) (reviewed in Ref. 10Briggs M.D. Chapman K.L. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). COMP is the fifth member of the thrombospondin protein family (11Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is found primarily in cartilage, tendon, and ligament (12Hedbom E. Antonsson P. Hjerpe A. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M.

Like matrilin-3 it is a modular protein and comprises a coiled-coil domain, four type II (epidermal growth factor-like) repeats, seven type III (TSP3) repeats, and a large C-terminal globular domain (16Newton G. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Lawler J. Genomics. 1994; 24: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). COMP mutations are found in both the TSP3 (85%) and C-terminal (15%) domains of COMP and are either missense mutations or small in-frame deletions or insertions (17Kennedy J. Jackson G. Ramsden S. Taylor J. Newman W. Wright M.J. Donnai D. Elles R. Briggs M.D. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 13: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Kennedy J. Jackson G.C. Barker F.S. Nundlall S. Bella J. Wright M.J. Mortier G.R. Neas K. Thompson E. Elles R. Briggs M.D. Hum. Mutat. 2005; 25: 593-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Type IX collagen is a heterotrimer of α1(IX) α2(IX) α3(IX) chains and a member of the FACIT (fibril-associated collagen with interrupted triple helices) group of collagens (19Olsen B.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It consists of three collagenous domains (COL1–3) separated by non-collagenous domains (NC1–NC4) and is closely associated with type II collagen, where it is thought to act as a molecular bridge between type II/XI collagen fibrils and other cartilage matrix proteins (19Olsen B.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The large NC4 domain is derived entirely from the α1(IX) gene (COL9A1) and along with the other NC domains has been shown to bind to the C-terminal domain of COMP in vitro (20Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegard D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 21Holden P.

Interestingly, type IX collagen gene mutations have a very restricted distribution, and all of them are postulated to cause an in-frame deletion from equivalent regions of the COL3 domain in the α1(IX), α2(IX), or α3(IX) chains (reviewed in Ref. 10Briggs M.D. Chapman K.L. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This precise grouping of type IX collagen gene mutations has yet to be fully explained; however, it is possible that these deletions may disrupt important interactions with other components of the cartilage ECM either directly, by deleting a binding site within the COL3 domain, or indirectly by changing the orientation of the α1(IX) NC4 domain relative to the type II/XI collagen fibril.Insight into the conformation of the matrilin-3 A-domain can be provided by striking sequence similarities with the I-domain of α1-integrin (6Jackson G.C. Barker F.S. Jakkula E. Czarny-Ratajczak M. Makitie O. Cole W.G. Wright M.J. Smithson S.F. Suri M. Rogala P. Mortier G.R. Baldock C. Wallace A. Elles R. Ala-Kokko L. Briggs M.D. J. Med. Genet. 2004; 41: 52-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The matrilin-3 A-domain, as well as the I-domain, adopts a Rossman fold with seven α-helices surrounding a central β-sheet comprising six β-strands (22Takagi J. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 141-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The top face of both domains contain a non-contiguous metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) (23Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Interactions at the MIDAS site of the integrin I-domain have been linked to a ∼10-Å shift in the position of the α-7 helix and results in a tertiary switch of the domain (22Takagi J. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 141-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This change in conformation is not just linked directly to binding of the metal ion but rather to a cooperative interaction of the cation and ligand to provide the “outside-in” signaling event. It has been hypothesized that A-domains, which contain a “perfect” MIDAS motif, might also bind metal ions and undergo a similar “integrin-like” switch in conformation (24Bhattacharya A.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Staunton D.E. Liddington R.C. Structure. 2004; 12: 371-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To date the ability of the A-domain of matrilin-3 to bind to cations and/or undergo a conformational change has not been determined. We therefore investigated if the human matrilin-3 A-domain was capable of binding metal ions and might also undergo a change in conformation similar to that of integrin I-domains. Zn2+ and Ca2+ ions were selected, because they are the most biologically relevant cations. Zn2+ has been shown to play important biological roles in cartilage organization (25Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Morgelin M. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In this study we have demonstrated that recombinant matrilin-3 A-domain can also adopt different conformations through a specific interaction with Zn2+.The precise function of matrilin-3 is still not fully understood, however, it has previously been described as a potential matrix adaptor or ECM-bridging molecule and is known to interact with a number of cartilage ECM proteins such as COMP and type IX collagen (26Mann H.H.

A-domains are known to mediate protein-protein interactions (23Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), and it is therefore possible that the single matrilin-3 A-domain has evolved a selective affinity for different types of cartilage molecules and participates in the assembly of the fibril network in the cartilage ECM (28Nicolae C. Ko Y.P. Miosge N. Niehoff A. Studer D. Enggist L. Hunziker E.B. Paulsson M. Wagener R. Aszodi A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2149-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this study we tested the ability of the matrilin-3 A-domain alone to bind to type II and type IX collagen in the presence of different cations. Binding assays were also performed in the presence of EDTA to determine if the cation-dependent conformational change in the structure of the A-domain affected its binding properties. We were able to demonstrate that the matrilin-3 A-domain binds with high affinity to full-length type IX collagen in a Zn2+-dependent manner. Furthermore, this binding was abolished when the type IX collagen contained an in-frame deletion previously shown to cause MED (30Bonnemann C.G. Cox G.F. Shapiro F. Wu J.J. Feener C.A. Thompson T.G.

Kivirikko S. Ala-Kokko L. Am. J. Med.

These data therefore provide the first insight into why MED mutations might cluster in the COL3 domain of type IX collagen.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Sequencing of Human Matrilin-3 A-domain—The matrilin-3 A-domain (contained in exon 2 of MATN3) had previously been amplified from genomic DNA by PCR and subcloned into pSecTag (6Jackson G.C. Barker F.S. Jakkula E. Czarny-Ratajczak M. Makitie O. Cole W.G. Wright M.J. Smithson S.F. Suri M. Rogala P. Mortier G.R. Baldock C. Wallace A. Elles R. Ala-Kokko L. Briggs M.D. J. Med. Genet. 2004; 41: 52-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This fragment was then subcloned a second time into pCEP4. The forward primer encompassed the first 20 nucleotides (from the ATG start codon) of the Ig γ-chain secretion signal found in pSecTag and included a NotI restriction site (primer 5′-gcggccgcatggagacagacacact-3′). The 3′-primer (5′-gcggccgctcacttatcgtcgtcatccttgtaatcacagaaggtttcctggaatct-3′) also contained an engineered NotI cleavage site in addition to an in-frame FLAG Tag (DYKDDDDK). PCR products were cloned using TA Cloning method (Invitrogen) and sequenced using M13R and M13 (–20) primers with ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). These sub-clones were digested with the restriction enzyme NotI and cloned into the pCEP4 expression vector (Invitrogen). Following transformation into TOP10 cells (Invitrogen) positive clones were obtained, which contain the correct nucleotide sequences in the right orientation. A single clone (pCEP4-MATN3WT) was used for all subsequent experiments.Matrilin-3 A-domain Expression and Purification—Purified pCEP4-MATN3WT DNA was transfected into 293-EBNA cells (human embryonic kidney cells, Invitrogen) using Lipo-fectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and after 24 h transfected cells were selected by the addition of Hygromycin B (50 μg/ml). Following cell confluency the medium was replaced with serum-free VPRO medium (JRH Biosciences). The cells were incubated in this medium for a further 48 h before the conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 4 min. The resulting supernatant (400 ml) was affinity-purified using the FLAG tag. Briefly, the conditioned medium was incubated with the anti-FLAG M2 affinity column (Sigma) for 1 h at 4°C. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads with FLAG peptide (50 μg/ml) in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with silver staining. The fractions containing the matrilin-3 A-domain were desalted using PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare) and further purified by anion-exchange chromatography on a MiniQ column using the Ettan purifier high-performance liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare).Cloning of Vitreous Form of Human Type IX Collagen—The vitreous form of collagen IX was generated using previously constructed full-length α1(IX) cDNA (33Pihlajamaa T. Perala M. Vuoristo M.M. Nokelainen M. Bodo M. Schulthess T. Vuorio E. Timpl R. Engel J. Ala-Kokko L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22464-22468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in pVL1392 vector (BD Pharmingen) as a template for PCR. The 72-nucleotide alternative exon 1 of α1(IX) was generated 5′ to COL3 domain in three consecutive PCR reactions using the previous reaction as a template for the next reaction. JYeye1 (5′-CTG TTG GGG CTC TGC TTG TGC GCG GCT CAA AGA GGT CCC CCG GGT GAG CAG-3′) and JYeyeR (5′-AGG AAT ACC ACG GCC TGG AAA TCC AC-3′) primers were used in the first reaction, JYeye2 (5′-GCG CGG GAC CGC GGG GCC CTG GGG CTG CTG CTG TTG GGG CTC TGC TTG TGC-3′) and JYeyeR in the second, and JYeye3 (5′-AGT CAT TGC GGC CGC ATG GCC TGG ACT GCG CGG GAC CGC GGG GCC CTG-3′) and JYeyeR in the third. JYeye3 primer contained an engineered NotI cleavage site. Final PCR product was ligated to pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced (Big Dye Terminator version 3.0, ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems). The resulting plasmid and fulllength α1(IX) cDNA in pVL1392 vector were digested with NotI and SbfI, and the generated alternative exon 1 containing piece was ligated to the digested α1(IX) cDNA in pVL1392 vector. The resulting construct was sequenced.Cloning of MED Mutant Form of Human Type IX Collagen—To generate the MED mutant form (containing a 12-amino acid deletion in COL3 domain) of α3(IX) chain, previously constructed full-length α3(IX) cDNA in pVL1392 vector (33Pihlajamaa T. Perala M. Vuoristo M.M. Nokelainen M. Bodo M. Schulthess T. Vuorio E. Timpl R. Engel J. Ala-Kokko L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22464-22468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was digested with XbaI and ligated to pGEM-3Zf(+) vector (Promega). The plasmid was cut with NotI and StuI to remove exon 3. mRNA was isolated from a MED mutant patient and reverse transcriptase was used to generate the cDNA containing the mutation. The cDNA was used in PCR with FIC (5′-GGC GGC CGC CGG GGC GCA GAG G-3′) and MH40 (5′-GCT CAC TCC TGC CTC TCC GG-3′) primers. PCR product was ligated to Sure Clone vector followed by cutting with NotI and StuI. The resulting piece was ligated to previously cut 9A3 cDNA in pGEM-3Zf(+) vector. The resulting 9A3 MED construct was cut from plasmid with XbaI and ligated to XbaI-cut pVL1392 and sequenced.Expression and Purification of Human Type IX Collagen Constructs—The cDNAs constructed above were co-transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9, Invitrogen) insect cells with a modified Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus using the BaculoGold™ transfection kit (BD Pharmingen). Sf9 cells were cultured in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) at 27 °C and were seeded at ∼60% confluency in tissue culture plates for the transfection. The viral pools were plaque-purified and amplified three to four times using monolayer (∼70% confluency) cultures.Trichoplusia ni (High Five, Invitrogen) insect cells were cultured in suspension in Sf-900 II SFM medium (Invitrogen) with or without 5% fetal bovine serum at 27 °C. Prior to the infection, the insect cells were seeded at 1–1.5 × 106 cells/ml for expression. The cells were co-infected with three viruses containing cDNAs for the various α1(IX), α2(IX), and α3(IX) chains and a double promoter virus 4PHαβ for the α and β subunits of human prolyl-4-hydroxylase cDNAs (34Nokelainen M. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Fietzek P.P. Kivirikko K.I. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), with a multiplicity of infection of 2 for each virus. Ascorbate (80 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium daily.After 72 h of infection, the High Five cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the medium was further clarified at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Collagen IX molecules were precipitated from the culture medium by adding solid ammonium sulfate to 26% saturation and placing the mixture on ice while stirring for 1 h. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and dissolved in 0.4 m NaCl, 2 m urea, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7, buffer at 4 °C overnight. The protein solution was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and then purified by gel filtration (Superdex™ 200, Amersham Biosciences) in the same buffer. The protein was further purified by cation-exchange chromatography (HiTrap™ SP HP or SP FF, Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm PIPES, 20 mm NaCl, 2 m urea, pH 6.5, buffer, eluting with an increasing NaCl concentration (0.02 m to 1 m NaCl). Fractions containing collagen IX were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm acetic acid and then concentrated.SDS-PAGE Analysis—SDS-PAGE was undertaken using 4–12% BisTris gradient gels (Invitrogen) with the MES buffer system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein samples were diluted in loading buffer with a reducing reagent then heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Silver staining of gel and peptide mass mapping of excised band were then performed.Mass Spectrometry—The identity of the recombinant protein was confirmed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Following SDS-PAGE the protein band thought to be the matrilin-3 A-domain was excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel digestion. In brief the sample was reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin. The peptides produced were extracted from the gel with sequential washes of ammonium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile with the combined extract dried to ∼20 μlina vacuum centrifuge. Mass spectrometry was performed on 5 μl of the sample using a Q-TOF Micro attached to a CapLC chromatography system (both Waters, UK). Proteins were separated by in-line reversed-phase chromatography before analysis by tandem mass spectrometry. The results obtained were interrogated against the SWISSPROT data base using Protein-Lynx Global Server V1.1 searching software (Micromass UK Ltd.).The mass of the recombinant protein was analyzed by mass spectrometry. Purified matrilin-3 A-domain was desalted using C4 reversed-phase ZipTip micro solid phase extraction tips (Millipore). The extracted samples were infused into an electrospray-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LCT, Waters, UK) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The multiply charged spectra obtained were deconvoluted iteratively using maximum entropy software (Waters, UK) to produce a molecular weight for each species present.Multiangle Laser Light Scattering Analysis—Samples of purified recombinant protein were applied to a Superdex 75 gelfiltration column (GE Healthcare) running at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with Tris-buffered saline buffer. Samples eluting from the column passed through an in-line DAWN EOS laser photometer (laser wavelength, 682 nm) and an Optilab rEX refractometer with QELS dynamic light scattering attachment. Light scattering intensity and eluant refractive index (concentration) were analyzed using ASTRA version 4.8 software to give a weight-averaged molecular mass. Following Superdex 75 chromatography, 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining.CD—Far-UV (190–260 nm) CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter. Measurements were taken every 0.2 nm in a 0.05-cm path length cell. Spectra were corrected for buffer absorbance and represent an average of 10 scans. Spectra were recorded in millidegrees and converted to mean residue ellipticities using concentrations estimated by absorbance profiles at 280 nm. Estimation of secondary structure content was performed using CDSSTR software program.Analytical Ultracentrifugation—The sedimentation coefficient for matrilin-3 A-domain was determined from velocity experiments using the Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). The experiments were performed using double sector cells and a rotor speed of 48000 rpm, taking 150 scans at 1.5-min intervals at a wavelength of 230 nm and at a temperature of 20 °C. The sedimenting boundaries were analyzed using the program Sedfit version 8.7, and the resulting apparent sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) were corrected for standard conditions using the program Sednterp developed by Hayes, Laue, and Philo (35Lebowitz J.

Hydrodynamic radius (RH) and frictional ratio (f/fo), which represents the deviation of the friction of the molecule from a theoretical sphere of the same molecular weight, were also calculated using Sednterp.Differential Scanning Calorimetry—The proteins' denaturation temperatures were determined using DSC (VP-DSC MicroCalorimeter, MicroCal Inc.). The protein samples (0.15 mg/ml) were buffer-exchanged using HiTrap Desalting columns (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, or 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. Both buffers were used as reference solutions for the scans. Samples were scanned once for thermal unfolding from 15 to 100 °C. Data conversion and analysis were performed with Origin software (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA).Dual Polarization Interferometry—The DPI experiments were performed on a Farfield AnaLight instrument. Purified recombinant matrilin-3 A-domain (at a concentration of 200 μg/ml) was immobilized onto an amine functionalized AnaChip using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate linker chemistry. Tris buffer (200 mm, pH 7.4) was then added to block unreacted bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate. After stabilizing the immobilized matrilin-3 A-domain with sufficient rinsing with Tris running buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl), 10 mm EDTA was injected to chelate any metal ions present. The protein was then exposed to ZnCl2 and CaCl2 at increasing concentrations (10, 25, 50, 100, 300, and 1000 μm). Matrilin-3 A-domain was regenerated between the two different metal ions with 10 mm EDTA. A more detailed protocol has been described by Thompsett and colleagues (36Thompsett A.R. Brown D.R. Biochim.

https://openalex.org/W2139059053,"Survivin is a member of the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) protein family, defined in part by the presence of a zinc-binding baculoviral inhibitory repeat (BIR) domain. Most BIR domains bind short sequences beginning with alanine, and in this manner, they recognize and block the action of key targets in apoptotic pathways. However, Survivin binds only very weakly to typical IAP ligands. Unique features of Survivin are the long C-terminal helix following the BIR domain and a short segment (linking the helix and BIR domains) that mediates Survivin homodimerization. Despite this detailed knowledge of the structure of Survivin itself, there is a current lack of understanding about how Survivin recognizes cellular binding partners, and consequently, many questions about Survivin function remain unanswered. We determined two co-crystal structures of Survivin and a minimal binding fragment from the chromosomal passenger protein Borealin, a well validated functional interactor. The interaction between Survivin and Borealin involves extensive packing between the long C-terminal helix of Survivin and a long Borealin helix. Surprisingly, an additional important interaction occurs between the Survivin homodimerization interface and a short segment of Borealin. This segment both structurally mimics and displaces one Survivin monomer. The relevance of this unexpected interaction was tested by mutagenesis of two key Borealin residues. Mutant Borealin introduced into HeLa cells failed to localize properly during mitosis and also caused mislocalization of other chromosomal passenger proteins.

In the 10 years since Survivin was discovered (1Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar), it has seemed at times to be a protein with too many functions. Survivin is a member of the baculoviral inhibitory repeat (BIR) 2The abbreviations used are: BIR, baculoviral inhibitory repeat; CPC, chromosomal passenger complex; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; HA, hemagglutinin. 2The abbreviations used are: BIR, baculoviral inhibitory repeat; CPC, chromosomal passenger complex; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; HA, hemagglutinin. domain family. Originally described as an IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) protein, it now assumes an increasingly complex role in the intrinsic cell death pathway (2Altieri D.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Survivin has a more clearly understood function in cell division (3Lens S.M.A. Vader G. Medema R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Despite intensive efforts to define Survivin function, little is known about how Survivin recognizes its binding partners. Indeed, the only three-dimensional structures available are for Survivin itself (4Verdecia M.A. Huang H. Dutil E. Kaiser D.A. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 5Chantalat L. Skoufias D.A. Kleman J.-P. Jung B. Dideberg O. Margolis R.L. Mol.

Olejniczak E.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggesting that this dimer may contribute to Survivin function. Throughout mitosis, Survivin is present in the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), where it is critically important for mitotic progression (8Vader G. Medema R.H. Lens S.M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 9Ruchaud S. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. September 12, 2007; 8: 798-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The CPC is currently known to have three members in addition to Survivin: the kinase Aurora B; an adapter protein, INCENP (inner centromere protein); and a recently discovered addition, Borealin (10Romano A. Guse A. Krascenicova I. Schnabel H. Schnabel R. Glotzer M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Gassman R. Carvalho A. Henzing A.J. Ruchaud S. Hudson D.F.

Cell. 2004; 118: 187-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). A key property of the CPC is that all members are obligate. Depletion of any one member causes mislocalization of all of the others and causes a variety of mitotic abnormalities, consistent with loss of complex function. Early in mitosis, the CPC is found along chromosome arms, but by prophase, it has concentrated at the inner centromeres. It is not clear why the CPC concentrates at the centromeres, as no direct receptor has been identified. One recent candidate is the structural component CENP-C (13Faragher A.J. Sun X.-M. Butterworth M. Harper N. Mulherin M. Ruchaud S. Earnshaw W.C. Cohen G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1337-1347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although direct binding to centromeric DNA has also been proposed (14Klein U.R. Nigg E.A. Gruneberg U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2547-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). While at the centromeres, the CPC plays one of its best known roles as part of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Loss of spindle assembly checkpoint function leads to chromosome segregation errors and a failure of the cell cycle to arrest in response to spindle poisons. Once all chromosomes have achieved biorientation and are under tension between the spindle poles, the spindle assembly checkpoint no longer signals, and the cell enters anaphase. At this time, the CPC relocates once more away from the centromeres to the central spindle. As the cell reaches telophase, the CPC concentrates at the midbody, where it is essential for cytokinesis. Loss of CPC function at this stage causes a failure of cells to divide fully, leading to binucleate and, eventually, multinucleate cells. A major structural role of the CPC is to target Aurora B kinase activity to its substrates at appropriate mitotic stages (3Lens S.M.A. Vader G. Medema R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 8Vader G. Medema R.H. Lens S.M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 9Ruchaud S. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. September 12, 2007; 8: 798-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Because of the mutual functional interdependence of the subunits at all mitotic stages, it has been difficult to dissect how this is achieved. It has been known for some time that the most important direct interaction of CPC members with Aurora B occurs through the short, highly conserved C terminus of INCENP, called the IN-box. This interaction activates the kinase, and the structure of this subcomplex of the CPC was determined recently (15Sessa F. Mapelli M. Ciferi C. Tarricone C. Areces L.B. Schneider T.R. Stukenberg P.T. Musacchio A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In contrast, the extreme N terminus of INCENP is important for Survivin binding. The discovery of the fourth passenger, Borealin, has greatly clarified some organizational aspects of this part of the CPC (10Romano A. Guse A. Krascenicova I. Schnabel H. Schnabel R. Glotzer M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Gassman R. Carvalho A. Henzing A.J. Ruchaud S. Hudson D.F. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Gerloff D.L. Earnshaw W.C. J.

Cell. 2006; 17: 1897-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Significantly, it was observed by researchers working in different organisms that Borealin and Survivin form a robust binary complex in vitro (10Romano A. Guse A. Krascenicova I. Schnabel H. Schnabel R. Glotzer M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Gassman R. Carvalho A. Henzing A.J. Ruchaud S. Hudson D.F. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Gerloff D.L. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). It was further determined that this binary complex has enhanced affinity for INCENP compared with either protein alone (14Klein U.R. Nigg E.A. Gruneberg U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2547-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 16Vader G. Kauw J.J.W. Medema R.H. Lens S.M.A. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We decided to map the interacting regions in the binary complex of the human proteins to better understand the ligand recognition properties of Survivin and to gain insight into CPC organization and function. Through sequence analysis and truncation studies, we identified a minimal fragment of Borealin capable of high affinity complex formation with Survivin. Surprisingly, the crystal structures of two different complexes suggest that the accepted Survivin homodimer is not relevant to mitotic function. Instead, mutation of two key Borealin residues present in its interface with Survivin caused extensive mislocalization of CPC proteins, supporting the functional importance of the new binding interface observed in our structures. Construction of Plasmids for Bacterial Coexpression—The gene for full-length human Survivin was subcloned in-frame with an N-terminal His6 tag into the T7 expression vector pET28 (kanR; EMD Biosciences). The gene for human Borealin was instead subcloned into pET21 (ampR). A C-terminal Strep-tag (IBA) was added to the Borealin construct by Kunkel mutagenesis. An alternative N-terminal tag (GB1 domain of protein G) was added to Borealin for some large-scale purifications for crystallography (see below). Truncation mutants were prepared from these constructs by Kunkel mutagenesis. The DNA sequences of all inserts were fully verified. Coexpression and Copurification Studies—The appropriate Survivin and Borealin constructs were cotransfected into BL21(DE3)pLysS Rosetta 2 cells (EMD Biosciences). Positive colonies were selected on 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. Single colonies were grown in LB broth at 37 °C under antibiotic selection until culture density reached A600 = 0.6. Expression was induced by addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cultures were shaken overnight at 22 °C. Harvested cells were lysed in 100 ml of buffer A (150 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) per liter of culture by passage through a Microfluidizer, and the soluble lysate was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose column (0.5 ml of resin/liter of culture; Qiagen Inc.). The column was washed with 20 volumes of buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole, and Survivin was eluted with 5 volumes of buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. Samples of eluted fractions (10 μl) were loaded onto 10-20% Tris/glycine-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) for analysis of coeluted proteins. Proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining. Confirmation of Borealin was done by Western blotting using an anti-Strep-tag primary antibody (Qiagen Inc.) followed by a rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Large-scale Purification of Complexes and Crystallization—Two complexes (full-length His6-Survivin plus Strep-tag-Borealin-(20-78) and His6-Survivin-(1-120) plus GB1-Borealin-(20-78)) were expressed and purified on Ni-NTA as described above. GB1 and His6 tags were removed by thrombin cleavage overnight. The proteins were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 (GE Healthcare) in buffer A and then concentrated to 4 and 17 mg/ml, respectively. Concentrated complexes were dialyzed into buffer B (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 0.1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine). Protein identities were verified by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing. Note that removal of the GB1 tag was initially incomplete but that further slow cleavage occurred upon concentration, such that there was no tag present in the crystallized complex. The full sequences of expressed proteins and final cleaved chains are shown in supplemental Scheme S1. Crystals of Borealin-(20-78) in complex with Survivin-(1-142) were grown by vapor diffusion in sitting drops containing 0.5 μl of protein and 0.5 μl of well solution (0.1 m NaHEPES (pH 7.5), 0.2 m CaCl2, and 28% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 400). The well solution for the complex with Survivin-(1-120) contained 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 8% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Crystals were obtained after ∼2 days at 19 °C. Prior to data collection, crystals were immersed in artificial mother liquor consisting of the well solution plus 35% polyethylene glycol 400 (Survivin-(1-142) complex) or 20% glycerol (Survivin-(1-120) complex) and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection and Structure Solution—A data set for the Survivin-(1-142)-Borealin crystals was collected at beamline 5.0.1 at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley Lab) and was processed with HKL software (supplemental Table S1) (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to space group C2. The data are anisotropic with a functional resolution of ∼2.4 Å. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using human Survivin (Protein Data Bank code 1F3H) (4Verdecia M.A. Huang H. Dutil E. Kaiser D.A. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) as a search model. Initial electron density maps revealed clear helical density for Borealin. A model was built consisting of Borealin residues 21-76 and Survivin residues 5-141. A 3.3-Å data set for the Survivin-(1-120)-Borealin crystals was acquired at beamline 9-2 at the Stanford Synchronized Radiation Laboratory and was processed with HKL software (supplemental Table S1) (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The space group is I4122. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the partially refined crystal structure of the Survivin-(1-142) complex and the program Phaser (CCP4, Daresbury Laboratory), revealing three complexes in the asymmetric unit. Each complex has density for Borealin residues 20-76 (plus one additional N-terminal residue from the thrombin cleavage site) and Survivin residues 5-119. Both structures were refined with the program REFMAC5 and included TLS refinement (19Winn M.D. Murshudov G.N. Papiz M.Z. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The final models have good stereochemistry: Ramachandran plots show that for the Survivin-(1-142) structure, 98.8% of all residues appear in the most favored or additionally allowed regions, with only two residues (1.2%) in generously allowed or disallowed regions (20Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Likewise, for the Survivin-(1-120) complex, 98.2% of all residues appear in the most favored or additionally allowed regions, with only 1.7% of residues in generously allowed or disallowed regions. Mitotic Localization of Borealin Mutants—Full-length wild-type Borealin and the Y54A/W70A mutant were each subcloned by PCR into pDONOR201 (Invitrogen) and fully sequenced before transfer into pDEST-12 (Invitrogen) additionally modified with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. HeLa cells (CCL-2, American Type Culture Collection) were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium on 18-mm coverslips in 12-well plates for 20 h. Cells were then transfected with plasmid (0.5 μg) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) for 6 h. The medium was replaced with medium containing 2 mm thymidine, and the cells were incubated for an additional 16 h. Cells were then released from the thymidine block by replacement of the medium. After an additional 8 h, cells were fixed for 20 min in paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and then blocked overnight in normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The primary antibodies used were rat anti-HA (1:1000; clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science), mouse anti-Aurora B (1:200; catalog no. 611082, BD Biosciences), and mouse anti-Survivin (1:200; catalog no. sc-17779, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). These were diluted in donkey serum and added to blocked coverslips for 1 h. After washing, the appropriate secondary antibody (Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-rat or Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse; 1:600; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was added for 45 min in the presence of Hoechst 33342 (1:30,000; Invitrogen). Cells were washed, and coverslips were mounted on slides in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were captured using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with a ×63 immersion objective and the acquisition program SlideBook (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc.). Analysis of the 280-amino acid Borealin sequence suggests that it may be largely α-helical but does not predict any globular domains. However, it has been reported that Borealin-(1-141) is fully competent to bind Survivin (11Gassman R. Carvalho A. Henzing A.J. Ruchaud S. Hudson D.F. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Gerloff D.L. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Within this N-terminal region are two potential coiled-coil sequences, one predicted strongly and a second predicted only weakly (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). A series of truncated Borealin constructs was prepared, focusing on the predicted boundaries of the helical elements. These were coexpressed with full-length His6-tagged Survivin in Escherichia coli. Survivin was purified on Ni-NTA beads, and eluted protein was probed for copurifying Borealin fragments. A fragment as short as Borealin-(20-60) (encompassing the first predicted coiled coil) could be detected, but Borealin-(20-78) appeared to be the shortest fragment with full affinity (Fig. 1B). In addition to the strongly predicted coiled coil, this fragment includes at its C terminus a short segment highly conserved in the single human Borealin and all other vertebrate Borealins of the more common Dasra B subtype (supplemental Fig. S2) (12Sampath S.C. Ohi R. Leismann O. Salic A. Pozniakovski A. Funabiki H. Cell. 2004; 118: 187-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). A subset of Borealin fragments was tested for binding to truncated forms of Survivin (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results suggest that the strongest interactions occur between Borealin residues 20-78 and the region of Survivin that follows the BIR domain, including the first part of the long helix. This region also includes the Survivin homodimerization interface (Fig. 1C). To better understand the interaction of Survivin with Borealin, we determined the x-ray crystal structures of both full-length Survivin and Survivin-(1-120) bound to Borealin-(20-78). The most striking aspect of both Survivin-Borealin complex structures is the 1:1 stoichiometry, which was unexpected based on the published structures of Survivin alone (Fig. 2A). Our complex structures show that Borealin wraps around Survivin, with the N-terminal residues of Borealin (residues 21-60) forming a long helix that packs against the Survivin C-terminal helix. This long Borealin helix is followed by two additional short helices that pack against the juncture of the Survivin BIR domain and its C-terminal helix. The Borealin-binding site overlaps with the Survivin homodimerization interface (4Verdecia M.A. Huang H. Dutil E. Kaiser D.A. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 5Chantalat L. Skoufias D.A. Kleman J.-P. Jung B. Dideberg O. Margolis R.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 183-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 7Sun C. Nettesheim D. Liu Z. Olejniczak E.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, Survivin cannot dimerize in this way when bound to Borealin. Closer examination revealed that the backbone conformation of Borealin-(64-73) is remarkably similar to that of Survivin-(92-101) in the homodimer, suggesting that this region of Borealin structurally mimics the displaced Survivin monomer (Fig. 2B). The core of the interaction is Borealin-(65-74), which packs tightly against Survivin. In particular, the invariant Borealin Trp70 side chain enters an enlarged pocket on Survivin, where >95% of its solvent-accessible surface area is buried (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S3). This suggests an explanation for the observed importance of this region in the truncation experiments (Fig. 1B). A second significant contact is provided by Borealin Tyr54 (∼70% buried), which is present near the C terminus of the long Borealin helix. Trp70 and Tyr54 are the only Borealin residues to bury at least 100 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface in the complex. The total interface buried by the Survivin-Borealin interaction is large (∼2800 Å2 in the Survivin-(1-142) complex), with Survivin and Borealin contributing equally to the contact surface. In comparison, ∼1000 Å2 is buried in the Survivin homodimer interface (5Chantalat L. Skoufias D.A. Kleman J.-P. Jung B. Dideberg O. Margolis R.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 183-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This suggests that the interaction of Survivin with Borealin is stronger than the interaction of Survivin with itself. Uncomplexed Borealin-(20-78) was insoluble (precluding equilibrium affinity measurements), but the purification of the heterocomplex from a large excess of expressed Survivin (data not shown) supports a higher affinity interaction. Interestingly, the recognition of Borealin by Survivin is very different from typical IAP-type peptide-binding pockets on other BIR domains (such as XIAP or ML-IAP) (Fig. 2D). Although the major interaction between Borealin and Survivin appears to be the 1:1 complex described above, we observed a crystal packing interaction for the Survivin-(1-120) complex that suggests the possibility of antiparallel 2:2 complex formation (supplemental Fig. S4). This interaction involves predominantly the long helices of two Borealin subunits that form extensive interhelical packing interactions. Notably, as discussed above, it does not involve homodimerization through the interface present in published Survivin structures. (Indeed, there are no Survivin-Survivin contacts in this crystal packing.) A model of a dimer of the Survivin-(1-142) complex based on the 2:2 packing interaction suggests that it might be possible for the full-length complex to dimerize in this way, but that it would require changes in the degree of kinking or supercoiling of the long helices (supplemental Fig. S4C). We observed a second possible antiparallel 2:2 arrangement in the crystal packing of the Survivin-(1-142) complex. Somewhat surprisingly, this contact does not involve any intimate interhelical packing between the 1:1 complexes, but instead involves BIR-BIR and BIR-helix contacts between Survivin monomers (supplemental Fig. S4D). However, once again, these Survivin-Survivin contacts do not involve any of the previously reported Survivin dimeric crystal contacts (4Verdecia M.A. Huang H. Dutil E. Kaiser D.A. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 5Chantalat L. Skoufias D.A. Kleman J.-P. Jung B. Dideberg O. Margolis R.L. Mol.

Cell. 2000; 6: 173-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We assessed the solution stoichiometry of the Survivin-(1-142) complex by equilibrium and velocity ultracentrifugation (supplemental Fig. S5). The data are most consistent with a mixed population of 1:1 complex and a smaller amount of aggregate of higher order than 2:2. We see no significant population of 2:2 complex but cannot rule out the possibility that it might form under some conditions. Instead, the observed tendency of the binary complex to aggregate suggested the presence of an additional binding surface and the possibility that our Borealin fragment might be sufficient to recruit INCENP to Survivin. To test this, we coexpressed a previously described minimized INCENP construct, glutathione S-transferase-INCENP-(1-58) (14Klein U.R. Nigg E.A. Gruneberg U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2547-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and the binary complex. We found that Borealin-(20-78) and Survivin copurified with the INCENP fragment at apparently stoichiometric levels (supplemental Fig. S6). To test the biological significance of the major binding interface seen in our crystal structures, we introduced two mutations into Borealin that might be expected to alter its interaction with Survivin (Y54A/W70A) (Fig. 2C). Given that Borealin-(1-60) (corresponding to the long helix) can bind weakly to full-length Survivin (Fig. 1), we tested whether the Y54A/W70A mutations affect binary complex formation between Survivin and Borealin-(20-78). Interestingly, we found that this binary complex could be purified from bacterial cultures in amounts comparable with those obtained with the wild-type fragment (data not shown), indicating that the mutant fragment retained significant affinity for Survivin. Full-length tagged wild-type and mutant Borealins were transiently transfected into HeLa cells and were determined to express equally (supplemental Fig. S7A). Immunofluorescence visualization of passenger proteins revealed that in the presence of the Borealin mutant, severe mislocalization occurred during later stages of mitosis (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S7). In particular, the Borealin mutant was itself incorrectly localized, whereas HA-tagged wild-type Borealin appeared to localize normally, with some background diffuse staining most likely caused by modest overexpression relative to the endogenous protein (supplemental Fig. S7). In the presence of transfected wild-type Borealin, Aurora B and Survivin localized in the typical manner of the passenger proteins. In contrast, in cells transfected with the Borealin mutant, Aurora B was partly associated with chromosomes during anaphase and telophase, whereas Survivin was always entirely mislocalized to the chromosomes during these phases (Fig. 3). Purified Survivin forms a dimer in solution (7Sun C. Nettesheim D. Liu Z. Olejniczak E.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and crystallizes as a dimer (4Verdecia M.A. Huang H. Dutil E. Kaiser D.A. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 5Chantalat L. Skoufias D.A. Kleman J.-P. Jung B. Dideberg O. Margolis R.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 183-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Mouse Survivin forms three distinct dimeric crystal packing contacts (6Muchmore S.W. Chen J. Jakob C. Zakula D. Matayoshi E.D. Wu W. Zhang H. Li F. Ng S.-C. Altieri D.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 173-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), one of which involves the same dimer interface seen in the structures of human Survivin. There was much attention paid to the question of which dimer was the “correct dimer,” but at the time, mutagenesis studies failed to resolve the issue (21Shi Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition to our results, recent mutagenesis studies probing the role of a Survivin nuclear export signal indirectly suggest that the accepted Survivin dimer may not be present in the functioning CPC (22Colnaghi R. Connell C.M. Barrett R.M.A. Wheatley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33450-33456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This nuclear export signal spans the Survivin dimer interface, and the mutants studied would not only be expected to affect the function of the nuclear export signal (as intended by the authors), but could also be expected to significantly destabilize the homodimer interface (especially T97E). Nevertheless, the Survivin mutants showed only minor differences in mitotic localization compared with wild-type Survivin (22Colnaghi R. Connell C.M. Barrett R.M.A. Wheatley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33450-33456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Despite this, it has generally been assumed that the relevant form of Survivin in vivo is a dimer. The observation that differently tagged Survivin variants co-immunoprecipitate lends some support to this idea (for example, see Ref. 14Klein U.R. Nigg E.A. Gruneberg U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2547-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, it has not yet been established what the overall stoichiometry is of the intact CPC (e.g. it could contain more than one “monomeric” Survivin). In addition, we have observed that even highly purified Survivin has an extreme tendency to form large aggregates, especially in lower ionic strength buffers. We suggest that any report of Survivin co-immunoprecipitating must therefore be viewed with caution. It would appear that our Borealin mutant (Y54A/W70A) has the capacity to act in a dominant-negative manner and that it therefore interacts with at least one of the other passenger proteins or with a structural receptor for the complex. Our bacterial coexpression assay (with mutant fragment 20-78) suggests Survivin as a strong candidate. We observed prominent defects in translocation of CPC components to the central spindle and midbody in the presence of mutant Borealin. This is consistent with the recent report that binding of the C terminus of Survivin to Borealin is especially important for targeting to these subcellular structures (17Lens S.M.A. Rodriguez J.A. Vader G. Span S.W. Giaccone G. Medema R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1897-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the functional defects we observed suggest that some aspect of CPC structure other than Survivin binding per se is perturbed in the presence of the mutant. Possibilities include loss of affinity for INCENP, failure of the CPC to bind to other cellular components, and a conformational change in the CPC involving the interaction surface we have mutated. We conclude that the interaction mode we have identified in our crystal structures is present in the chromosomal passenger complex in human cells and that it is important for the full function of the complex.

Despite its essential role in the biogenesis of mitochondria, the mechanism by which the translocation motor functions is still largely unknown. The goal of this work was to carry out a structure-function analysis of the mitochondrial translocation motor utilizing purified components, with an emphasis on the formation of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex. To this end, we purified Tim44 and monitored its interaction with other components of the motor using cross-linking with bifunctional reagents. The effects of nucleotides, the J-domain-containing components, and the P5 peptide (CALLSAPRR, representing part of the mitochondrial targeting signal of aspartate aminotransferase) on the formation of the translocation motor were examined. Our results show that only the peptide and nucleotides, but not J-domain-containing proteins, affect the Tim44-mHsp70 interaction. Additionally, binding of Tim44 to mHsp70 prevents the formation of a complex between the latter and Tim14/Pam18-Tim16/Pam16. Thus, mutually exclusive interactions between various components of the motor with mHsp70 regulate its functional cycle.

Thus, mutually exclusive interactions between various components of the motor with mHsp70 regulate its functional cycle. The results are discussed in light of known models for the function of the mitochondrial translocation motor. Only a very small fraction of the estimated ∼800–1000 mitochondrial proteins are made in situ (eight in yeast). The rest are encoded by nuclear genes, synthesized in the cytosol, and then delivered to one of the four mitochondrial compartments: the outer membrane, inner membrane, and intermembrane space and the matrix. Each compartment contains essential proteins for the viability of every eukaryotic cell. Thus, functional import systems for nuclear encoded proteins are indispensable for the biogenesis of mitochondria (1Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The import of nuclear encoded proteins into the mitochondria is a multistep process mediated by the coordinated action of translocation machineries localized in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes (2Stojanovski D. Rissler M. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 3Mokranjac D. Neupert W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The TOM (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane) complex is a multimeric oligomer that constitutes the main portal of protein entry into mitochondria. As such, it serves for the recognition, insertion, and delivery of all nuclear encoded mitochondrial precursor proteins (2Stojanovski D. Rissler M. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 3Mokranjac D. Neupert W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4Neupert W.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3259-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Proteins that contain N-terminal targeting signals and that are destined for full translocation across the inner membrane are transferred from the TOM complex to the TIM23 complex (translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane). The latter complex is composed of two integral inner membrane proteins, Tim17 and Tim23. Although the function of Tim17 in mediating protein import is not yet well understood, Tim23 forms the translocation channel in the inner membrane during the import process. A third protein, Tim50 (6Geissler A. Chacinska A. Truscott K.N. Wiedemann N. Brandner K. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Cell. 2002; 111: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 7Mokranjac D. Paschen S.A. Kozany C. Prokisch H. Hoppins S.C. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Hell K.

Cell. 2002; 111: 519-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), probably serves as a receptor in the mitochondrial intermembrane space for proteins to be handled by the TIM23 complex. Recently, it was shown that Tim50 also maintains the permeability barrier of the mitochondrial inner membrane via a direct interaction with Tim23 (9Meinecke M. Wagner R. Kovermann P. Guiard B. Mick D.U. Hutu D.P. Voos W. Truscott K.N. Chacinska A. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Science. 2006; 312: 1523-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A precursor protein that is found in transit in the TIM23 channel requires additional help to be imported completely into the mitochondrial matrix. This final step of translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane is catalyzed by the function of a translocation motor at whose core stands the matrix-localized, ATP-hydrolyzing, 70-kDa heat shock protein mHsp70; its J-domain-containing co-chaperone complex, Tim14/Pam18-Tim16/Pam16; the nucleotide exchange factor Mge1; and the component that anchors mHsp70 to the TIM23 channel, Tim44 (4Neupert W.

Tim44 is a peripheral membrane protein that is found in close proximity to the precursor protein during its passage in the import channel. Tim44 associates transiently with the TIM23 complex to perform its function, and this association is essential for normal import of matrix-localized proteins by mitochondria (12Kronidou N.G. Oppliger W. Bolliger L. Hannavy K. Glick B.S. Schatz G. Horst M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12818-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13Schneider H.C. Berthold J.

Craig E.A. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It was shown in vitro that Tim44 is also able to interact with negatively charged phospholipids, particularly cardiolipin (15Weiss C. Oppliger W. Vergeres G. Demel R. Jeno P. Horst M. de Kruijff B. Schatz G. Azem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Upon association with the import channel, Tim44 recruits mHsp70 to the channel in a nucleotide-dependent manner. Regulation of this interaction involves the nucleotide exchange factor Mge1 (16Deloche O. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23960-23966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Westermann B. Prip-Buus C. Neupert W. Schwarz E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3452-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the J-domain-containing chaperone complex Tim14/Pam18-Tim16/Pam16 (18Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K.

A. 2003; 100: 13839-13844Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Two models, the active pulling and the trapping (Brownian ratchet), have been suggested initially to explain how proteins are translocated across the inner membrane and, in particular, the ability of mitochondria to import stably folded proteins. In the pulling model, mHsp70 undergoes a conformational change generating an active pulling force on the polypeptide chain. This pulling force, controlled by ATP binding, drives the unfolding of precursor proteins and their concomitant translocation across the inner membrane. According to this model, the pulling force will be effective only if mHsp70 forms a ternary complex with the imported precursor protein and Tim44. The latter would provide a platform for a lever-like movement of mHsp70 (21Glick B.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 11-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The trapping model proposes a movement of the polypeptide chain in the translocation channel due to Brownian molecular motion, which is then trapped by interaction of mHsp70 with the matrix-exposed part of the polypeptide. Trapping by mHsp70 leads to vectorial transport, as the polypeptide chain can no longer move backward. According to the ratchet model, the unfolding of the precursor protein is achieved by trapping the conformational changes of the polypeptide chain that occur with natural breathing of the protein (4Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Recently, a third model, the “entropic pulling,” was proposed. This model suggests that the bulky mHsp70 bound to the translocating chain reduces the latter's conformational freedom, thereby accelerating protein import by means of entropic pulling (22De Los Rios P. Ben-Zvi A. Slutsky O. Azem A. Goloubinoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6166-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The entropic pulling model suggests the presence of active pulling, of entropic origin, but in the absence of a molecular fulcrum. Thus, both the Brownian ratchet and entropic pulling models have similar molecular requirements for functioning during protein import into the matrix. In this study, we used cross-linking with the bifunctional reagent disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) 3The abbreviations used are: DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate; TEV, tobacco etch virus. 3The abbreviations used are: DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate; TEV, tobacco etch virus. to study the formation of the translocation motor utilizing purified components. Mechanistic implications of the results are discussed in light of these known models for function of the translocation motor. Materials—Nucleotides were purchased from Sigma: ATP (catalog no. A7699), high pressure liquid chromatography-purified ADP (catalog no. A6521), and AMP-PNP (catalog no. A2647). Construction of N-terminally Octahistidine-tagged Tim44—A yeast Tim44 open reading frame lacking 43 N-terminal amino acids (corresponding to the mitochondrial targeting sequence) was amplified using forward primer 5′-TAA GGA TCC CAA GGT GGA AAC CCT CGA and backward primer 5′-TAA GCG GCC GCT CAG GTG AAT TGT CTA GA. The PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega Corp.) and sequenced to confirm the fidelity of the Taq polymerase. The fragment was digested with BamHI-NotI and ligated with a double-digested (BamHI-NotI) modified pET-21d(+) vector (Novagen). The resulting recombinant plasmid encodes a Tim44 protein in which the mitochondrial targeting sequence is replaced by an initiation codon followed by a octahistidine tag and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site. The His-tagged Tim44 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21. Purification of Octahistidine-tagged Tim44—The bacterial transformants were grown in 1 liter of LB medium at 37 °C to A600 = 0.5–0.6, and overexpression of Tim44 was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. The cells were then harvested, suspended in 100 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1500 units of DNase, and protease inhibitor mixture (catalog no. 11873580001, Roche Applied Science)), disrupted using a Microfluidizer (Tetra Sense), and centrifuged at 20,000 × g to clear the solution. The supernatant was loaded at 1 ml/min onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Bio-Rad) that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.4 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol). The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer B and developed with a linear imidazole gradient (10–500 mm) in buffer B. Tim44 eluted at ∼200 mm imidazole. Fractions enriched in Tim44 were pooled, and protein concentration was determined. TEV protease was added at 1:50 (w/w) to the Tim44 eluate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. To purify Tim44 further, the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose eluate was concentrated to ∼1 ml in Centricon tubes (Vivascience) and further purified using a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer C (300 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at a flow rate 1 ml/min. Tim44 eluted at ∼100 ml of buffer C and was >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. The Tim44 buffer was exchanged (PD-10, GE Healthcare) into 20 mm Na+-HEPES (pH 7.4) and 100 mm NaCl, concentrated to ∼10–20 mg/ml in Centricon tubes, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Purification of [35S]Met-radiolabeled Tim44—Purification was carried out essentially as described above, except that the bacteria overexpressing Tim44 were grown in dilute LB medium (0.25% Bacto-Tryptone, 0.125% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl). Production of radiolabeled Tim44 was initiated by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 5 mCi of Redivue l-[35S]methionine (catalog no. AG1094, Amersham Biosciences). Construction and Purification of the C-terminal Domain of Tim44—A yeast Tim44 open reading frame lacking 210 N-terminal amino acids was amplified using forward primer 5′-GGA TCC ACA AAT ATC GAG TCT AAA GAA and backward primer 5′-TAA GCG GCC GCT CAG GTG AAT TGT CTA GA. The PCR product was cloned in a modified pET-21d(+) vector. The resulting plasmid overexpresses Tim44 carrying an octahistidine tag at its N terminus followed by the TEV protease recognition site. The purification procedure was carried out as described above for full-length Tim44. Purification of the Tim14/Pam18-Tim16/Pam16 Complex—A plasmid co-overexpressing a soluble domain of Tim16/Pam16 named Tim16s/Pam16s, containing an octahistidine tag at the N terminus, and the soluble domain of Tim14/Pam18 named Tim14j/Pam18j was constructed (23D'Silva P.R. Schilke B. Walter W. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The histidine tag is removable by digestion with TEV protease. The full purification procedure is described in Ref. 24Iosefson O. Levy R. Marom M. Slutsky-Leiderman O. Azem A. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar. Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutations were created using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (catalog no. 0720099, Stratagene). PCR amplification of mutant Tim44 was preformed with forward primer 5′-GAA TGG GAG AAG TCT CAG GCA CTG CAG GAG AAC and backward primer 5′-GTT CTC CTG CAG TGC CTG GAG ACT TCT CCC ATT C. Recombinant N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged Tim44 cloned in the pGEM-T-Easy vector was used as a template. Following sequence analysis to confirm the mutation, the PCR product was digested with BamHI-NotI and cloned into the modified pET-21d(+) vector. Cross-linking of Complexes—Cross-linking was carried out with 1 mm DSS at room temperature for 30 min in 20 mm Na+-HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl (50 KCl was added when Tim14/Pam18-Tim16/Pam16 was present), and 200 mm NaCl. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-containing sample buffer. The cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using an acrylamide gradient of 4–16%. Miscellaneous—SDS electrophoresis was carried using the Laemmli buffer system (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205593) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations indicated in this study were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (catalog no. B9643, Sigma) with bovine serum albumin as a standard and refer to monomer concentrations. mHsp70 (26Weiss C. Niv A. Azem A. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 24: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and Mge1 (27Azem A. Oppliger W. Lustig A. Jeno P. Feifel B. Schatz G. Horst M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20901-20906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were purified as described. Purification of Recombinant Yeast Tim44—In a previous study, it was shown that when overexpressed in bacteria, yeast Tim44 containing a C-terminal hexahistidine tag is found in the soluble fraction of bacterial cell lysate. However, Tim44 was readily degraded during our attempts to purify it. To inhibit the degrading protease, the initial purification steps were carried out in the presence of urea, which was removed during the final step of purification (15Weiss C. Oppliger W. Vergeres G. Demel R. Jeno P. Horst M. de Kruijff B. Schatz G. Azem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here, we report a new purification protocol for recombinant yeast Tim44 overexpressed in bacteria and carrying an N-terminal octahistidine tag. When a commercial protease inhibitor mixture was added to the lysates, a significant amount of Tim44 was found intact after the nickel-agarose purification step. After removing the octahistidine tag by TEV protease cleavage and subsequent gel filtration, Tim44 was >95% pure (supplemental Fig. S1). Effect of Nucleotides on the Formation of the Tim44-mHsp70 Complex—We developed a method that would be suitable to detect the formation of a Tim44-mHsp70 complex and to monitor the effect of various cofactors (i.e. nucleotides and co-chaperones) on complex formation in vitro. The method, a version of a gel-shift assay, utilizes cross-linking with bifunctional reagents and is carried out as follows. [35S]Met-radiolabeled Tim44 was purified and incubated with increasing concentrations of mHsp70 to allow complex formation. Next, the Tim44-mHsp70 complex was stabilized by cross-linking with the bifunctional cross-linker DSS. Finally, the cross-linking products were separated by gradient SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. A shift in the mobility of the radiolabeled Tim44 in the presence of an added component compared with Tim44 alone indicates complex formation. Tim44 alone was detected essentially as a single band (Fig. 1A, lane 1) corresponding in its mobility to the monomeric form (data not shown). This result confirms our previous work showing that Tim44 is monomeric in solution (15Weiss C. Oppliger W. Vergeres G. Demel R. Jeno P. Horst M. de Kruijff B. Schatz G. Azem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the presence of mHsp70, a new major band was observed, at the expense of the monomeric Tim44, representing a complex of Tim44 bound to mHsp70 (Fig. 1A, lanes 2–6). Maximal formation of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex was reached at 3 μm mHsp70, which was close to the Tim44 concentration (2 μm) present in the reaction mixture. A second minor form of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex was also observed (Fig. 1, asterisks). The latter form probably represents higher oligomers of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex. It was suggested previously that the functional form of the import channel is dimeric (28Bauer M.F. Sirrenberg C. Neupert W. Brunner M. Cell. 1996; 87: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Tim44-mHsp70 complex itself has a tendency to form dimers. Notably, much less Tim44-mHsp70 complex was observed in the presence of ATP (Fig. 1B). Similar results (i.e. weaker binding in the presence of ATP) were also observed in pulldown experiments using Tim44 carrying a histidine tag (supplemental Fig. S2). In the presence of Mge1, we observed a new cross-linked form representing a complex composed of Tim44-mHsp70-Mge1 (Fig. 1C). Similar to the complex formed in the absence of Mge1, much less Tim44-mHsp70-Mge1 complex was observed in the presence of ATP (Fig. 1D). We conclude that ATP destabilizes the interaction between mHsp70 and Tim44. In the cell, mHsp70 is expected to be in complex with either ADP or ATP. Therefore, the formation of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex was examined in the presence of ADP as well. As shown in Fig. 2, the Tim44-mHsp70 complex obtained in the presence of ADP was the strongest. Although the complex with ADP was consistently more stable than that lacking nucleotide, we were not able to demonstrate that this phenomenon is statistically significant (supplemental Fig. S3). Significant binding was also observed in the presence of AMP-PNP. Thus, the Tim44-mHsp70 interaction is modulated by nucleotides in a manner similar to what has been observed with solubilized mitochondria (12Kronidou N.G. Oppliger W. Bolliger L. Hannavy K.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in the presence of Mge1 as well (data not shown). Several observations exclude the possibility that Tim44 was associated with mHsp70 as an unfolded substrate. First, when the purified Tim44 was examined by CD spectroscopy, its spectrum was consistent with that of a folded protein, with a Tm of ∼51 °C (supplemental Fig. S4). Second, Tim44 did not affect the ATPase activity of mHsp70 under any conditions examined (data not shown), as would be expected from an unfolded substrate (27Azem A. Oppliger W. Lustig A. Jeno P. Feifel B. Schatz G. Horst M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20901-20906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29D'Silva P. Liu Q. Walter W. Craig E.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1084-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Third, when similar experiments were carried out in the presence of DnaK, only a minute amount of Tim44 was detected bound to DnaK under all conditions examined (Fig. 2). This result is consistent with previous observations showing that DnaK does not complement a deletion of yeast mHsp70 (30Moro F. Okamoto K. Donzeau M. Neupert W. Brunner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6874-6880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Lastly, a Tim44 mutant (E67A) was found to be impaired in its interaction with mHsp70 (see below). Mapping the mHsp70-binding Site on Tim44—We have shown previously that yeast Tim44 contains a tightly folded domain that is located at the C terminus of the molecule (∼25 kDa) (15Weiss C. Oppliger W. Vergeres G. Demel R. Jeno P. Horst M. de Kruijff B. Schatz G. Azem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the Tim44 C-terminal domain was solved (31Josyula R. Jin Z. Fu Z. Sha B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 798-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and confirmed our previous predictions. We wanted to determine whether the tightly folded C-terminal domain of Tim44 is able to interact with mHsp70. To this end, the radiolabeled C-terminal domain of Tim44 was overexpressed in bacteria and purified. Next, its ability to bind mHsp70 was examined using cross-linking with DSS. The results presented in Fig. 3 show that the C-terminal domain of yeast Tim44 was less able to bind mHsp70 in comparison with full-length Tim44, indicating that the N terminus of Tim44 may play an important role in the interaction with mHsp70. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we found that mutating amino acid 67 of Tim44 from Glu to Ala was lethal for yeast cells (data not shown). Because the E67A mutation is located at the N terminus of Tim44, we examined whether the lethal phenotype is due to an impaired interaction of Tim44 with mHsp70. For this purpose, the radiolabeled Tim44 mutant was purified, and its interaction with mHsp70 was examined using cross-linking. As shown in Fig. 4A, in the absence of Mge1, E67A mutant Tim44 bound mHsp70 slightly less compared with wild-type Tim44 in the presence of both ADP and ATP. Notably, in the presence of Mge1, the binding of E67A mutant Tim44 was strongly impaired under all conditions tested (Fig. 4B). Thus, Glu67, located at the N terminus of Tim44, may play an important role in the binding of Tim44 to mHsp70. Effect of the P5 Peptide on the Formation of the Tim44-mHsp70 Complex—The translocation motor binds precursor proteins during its functional cycle. The P5 peptide, derived from the mitochondrial targeting signal sequence of aspartate aminotransferase, is known to bind Hsp70 chaperones, including mHsp70 (27Azem A. Oppliger W. Lustig A. Jeno P. Feifel B. Schatz G. Horst M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20901-20906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 33Liu Q. Krzewska J. Liberek K. Craig E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6112-6118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of the P5 peptide on the formation of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex was examined. Notably, under all conditions examined, the P5 peptide triggered dissociation of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex (Fig. 5). A control peptide (LEEDLRGYM-SWI) did not trigger dissociation of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex (data not shown). Thus, the binding of Tim44 and the P5 peptide to mHsp70 is mutually exclusive: mHsp70 cannot bind Tim44 when a peptide is bound to it. From a mechanistic point of view, the results presented here suggest that precursor binding by mHsp70 causes instant dissociation from its complex with Tim44, which consequently cannot serve as a fulcrum for the function of mHsp70. Effect of Tim14/Pam18-Tim16/Pam16 Co-chaperones on the Formation of the Tim44-mHsp70 Complex—A membrane-associated complex of co-chaperones, Tim14/Pam18-Tim16/Pam16, was shown to be a vital component of the translocation motor. It has been suggested that the role of Tim14/Pam18, similar to other J-domain-containing chaperones, is to enhance the ATPase activity of mHsp70 and to promote a conformation that is strongly associated with peptide (18Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4945-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 19Truscott K.N. Voos W. Frazier A.E. Lind M. Li Y. Geissler A. Dudek J. Muller H. Sickmann A.

Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A subsequent study showed that Tim16/Pam16 acts to antagonize the enhancing effect of Tim14/Pam18 by reducing it by half (36Li Y. Dudek J. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Voos W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38047-38054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, another work has suggested that enhancement of the ATPase activity by Tim14/Pam18 is not essential for the in vivo function of the co-chaperone complex (23D'Silva P.R. Schilke B. Walter W. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Previous studies carried out using solubilized mitochondria demonstrated that both Tim14/Pam18 and Tim16/Pam16 function in vivo as one stable complex (18Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4945-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 19Truscott K.N. Voos W. Frazier A.E. Lind M. Li Y. Geissler A. Dudek J. Muller H. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Meisinger C. Guiard B.

Biol. 2004; 11: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, we focused primarily on the effect of the Tim14/Pam18-Tim16/Pam16 complex on the Tim44-mHsp70 interaction. The concentrations of Tim44 and the Tim14j/Pam18j-Tim16s/Pam16s complex (soluble domains of the complex) were kept equal (1.2 μm each), and the formation of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex was examined. The results presented in Fig. 6A show that the presence of the Tim14j/Pam18j-Tim16s/Pam16s complex had very little effect on the formation of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex (10% less bound at 2 μm mHsp70). A very significant result is the fact that Tim14j/Pam18j-Tim16s/Pam16s did not form a complex with Tim44 (Fig. 6A) or with the Tim44-mHsp70 complex (Fig. 6A, lanes 2 and 3). One explanation for this result would be that mHsp70 can form a complex either with the Tim14/Pam18-Tim16/Pam16 complex or with Tim44 but has a much higher affinity for Tim44. To examine this possibility, complexes were formed, stabilized by cross-linking with DSS, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by staining with Coomassie Blue. Indeed, when incubated alone, mHsp70 and Tim14j/ Pam18j-Tim16s/Pam16s associated to form a complex (Fig. 6B). Thus, in vitro mHsp70 was detected as binding either to Tim44 or to the Tim14/Pam18-Tim16/Pam16 complex, but not to both simultaneously (supplemental Fig. 2S). The aim of this work was a structure-function analysis of the mitochondrial translocation motor with an emphasis on interactions between various components of the motor. For the purpose of the study, we developed a novel method using cross-linking with DSS to monitor the interaction between the various purified partner proteins. The advantage of using cross-linking to investigate protein-protein interactions is that the complexes are stabilized with no disruption of the equilibrium in the system, which enables us to determine the steady-state levels of various complexes. Properties of the Tim44-mHsp70 Complex—Cross-linking with DSS showed that Tim44 interacts with mHsp70, forming a hetero-oligomer. A dimer of the Mge1 nucleotide exchange factor associates with the complex, leading to the formation of a heterotrimeric complex. We demonstrated previously that when examined by the protease resistance assay, the C terminus of Tim44 (∼25 kDa) forms a tightly folded domain (15Weiss C. Oppliger W. Vergeres G. Demel R. Jeno P. Horst M. de Kruijff B. Schatz G. Azem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have shown here that mHsp70 interacts very weakly with the purified C-terminal domain of Tim44. However, because of the fact that we have not been able to purify the N-terminal domain, we did not demonstrate its direct binding to mHsp70. Thus, we cannot exclude another interesting possibility, viz. that the N-terminal domain affected the folding of the C-terminal domain slightly and altered the binding of the latter to mHsp70. Additional work is needed to demonstrate which possibility is correct. Finally, we found that a single point mutation (E67A) of Tim44 that is lethal for yeast leads to a significant reduction in the formation of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex, in particular in the presence of Mge1. Why is the effect of the E67A mutation more pronounced in the presence of Mge1? It is possible that Mge1 induces a conformation of mHsp70 that is less tightly bound to Tim44. This view is supported by the observation that at low mHsp70 concentrations, less Tim44 was associated with mHsp70 in the presence of Mge1 than in its absence (Fig. 1, C versus A) (29D'Silva P. Liu Q. Walter W. Craig E.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1084-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 37Liu Q. D'Silva P. Walter W. Marszalek J. Craig E.A. Science. 2003; 300: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Overall, the results suggest that Glu67, located at the N terminus of Tim44, is probably involved in the formation of a complex with mHsp70. Nucleotides Modulate the Tim44-mHsp70 Interaction—The function of Hsp70 chaperones is modulated by nucleotides. Nucleotide-dependent formation of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex has also been demonstrated using solubilized mitochondria (12Kronidou N.G. Oppliger W. Bolliger L. Hannavy K. Glick B.S. Schatz G. Horst M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12818-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13Schneider H.C. Berthold J. Bauer M.F. Dietmeier K. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found in this study that in vitro nucleotides differentially affect the formation of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex. The strongest formation of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex was achieved in the presence of ADP. In contrast, in the presence of ATP, very little mHsp70 complex was observed. Thus, mHsp70 alternates between at least two forms in a nucleotide-dependent manner. One form, in the presence of ADP, has a high affinity for Tim44, whereas the second form, in the presence of ATP, has a weak affinity for Tim44. Similar modulation by nucleotides has been observed by several groups in solubilized mitochondria (4Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 38von Ahsen O. Voos W. Henninger H. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29848-29853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, another study carried out in vitro demonstrated no modulation of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex by nucleotides (37Liu Q. D'Silva P. Walter W. Marszalek J. Craig E.A. Science. 2003; 300: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We conjecture that the contradictory results are due to the different methods used in the respective studies to detect complex formation. Mutually Exclusive Interactions of the Peptide and Tim44 with mHsp70—An essential difference between models describing the function of the translocation motor is the need for a fulcrum to enable active unfolding of precursor proteins by mHsp70. Such a fulcrum would be provided for mHsp70 by its membrane anchor, Tim44. Notably, under all conditions examined here, we found that binding of the P5 peptide to mHsp70 triggers the dissociation of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex. Dissociation of the Tim44-mHsp70 complex was not affected by the type of nucleotide added or the presence of the Tim14/Pam18-Tim16/Pam16 complex. However, active pulling by the mitochondrial translocation motor requires that mHsp70 be anchored to Tim44 while being simultaneously bound to precursor proteins. Thus, the results that we obtained in this study are difficult to reconcile with active pulling, in its classical version (21Glick B.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 11-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and are compatible with a function via Brownian ratchet (4Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) or active pulling as suggested by the entropic pulling mechanism (22De Los Rios P. Ben-Zvi A. Slutsky O. Azem A. Goloubinoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6166-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Role of Tim14/Pam18-Tim16/Pam16 Co-chaperones in the Functional Cycle of the Motor—The results of this study show that, despite the fact that the Tim14j/Pam18j-Tim16s/Pam16s complex is able to form a complex with mHsp70, the interaction between mHsp70 and Tim44 is much stronger. In other words, when the Tim14j/Pam18j-Tim16s/Pam16s complex and Tim44 are both present, mHsp70 associates only with Tim44. In light of these results, one could suggest possible roles for the Tim14/Pam18-Tim16/Pam16 complex in the functional cycle of the motor, as follows. (i) One role would be to enhance the ATPase activity of mHsp70 and to endorse tight locking of substrate in the binding site of mHsp70. Such an effect has not been demonstrated yet because the Tim14/Pam18-Tim16/Pam16 complex itself does not affect the ATPase activity of mHsp70. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that enhancement of the ATPase activity of mHsp70 by the Tim14/Pam18-Tim16/Pam16 complex requires the context of the translocation channel. (ii) The observation that mHsp70 favors association with Tim44 rather than with the Tim14/Pam18-Tim16/Pam16 complex suggests that the latter may serve to recruit mHsp70 to the translocation motor prior to its transfer to Tim44. This would ensure the presence of several mHsp70 molecules that are in close proximity to the import channel, thereby increasing the local concentration of mHsp70.

Recently, a conserved pectin utilization pathway was discovered in a variety of human pathogens from Enterobacteraciae (1Rodionov D.A. Gelfand M.S. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 3571-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This pathway is an abridged form of the efficient and highly decorated extracellular pectin degradation systems found in soft rot-causing bacteria from the genus Erwinia (2Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Condemine G. Nasser W. Reverchon S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 213-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Pectin is a heterogeneous polysaccharide primarily composed of an α-d-1,4-linked polygalacturonic acid backbone. The main function of this carbohydrate is to stabilize structural polysaccharides such as cellulose and xylan, providing rigidity to the cell wall. Degradation of this structural “glue” by the enzymes of plant pathogens therefore results in the characteristic cell necrosis and tissue maceration during soft rot infections. The majority of structural biology within this field has focused on the primary secreted agents of pathogenesis, which include pectate lyases (3Pickersgill R. Jenkins J. Harris G. Nasser W.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although these enzymes utilize distinct catalytic mechanisms, they commonly display a right-handed parallel β-helix topology (9Jenkins J. Pickersgill R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 111-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). There is a notable exception, however, because family 10 pectate lyases adopt an (α/α)6 toroid conformation (10Charnock S.J. Brown I.E. Turkenburg J.P. Black G.W. Davies G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12067-12072Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Novoa De Armas H. Verboven C. De Ranter C. Desair J. Vande Broek A. Vanderleyden J. Rabijns A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 999-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Interestingly, superimposition of bound oligogalacturonide substrates within the active sites of these two different pectate lyase folds showed that despite the disparity in overall structure, there is remarkable similarity in the architecture of the catalytic residues (10Charnock S.J. Brown I.E. Turkenburg J.P. Black G.W. Davies G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12067-12072Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This suggested that the process of galacto-configured uronic acid β-elimination by distinct enzymes demands a conserved framework within the active site. Following polygalacturonic acid depolymerization, oligogalacturonides are shuttled into the periplasm through a specific porin, KdgM (12Blot N. Berrier C. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Ghazi A.

Within the periplasmic compartment there are commonly four conserved proteins present to further process oligo- and polygalacturonic acid substrates for intracellular transport (1Rodionov D.A.

These proteins include a family 32 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM32) (16Abbott D.W. Hrynuik S. Boraston A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); a family 2 polysaccharide lyase (PL2A) and a family 28 glycoside hydrolase (GH28) (17Abbott D.W. Boraston A.B. J. Mol.

Boraston A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar). Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the PL2A from Yersinia enterocolitica (YePL2A), 2The abbreviations used are: YePL2A, Y. enterocolitica pectate lyase 2A; YePL2B, Y. enterocolitica pectate lyase 2B; trigalUA, trigalacturonic acid; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; CAPSO, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid sodium salt. which is the first (α/α)7 barrel fold ever found in a prokaryotic protein. In addition we have determined the structure of this protein in complex with a metal cofactor and a trigalacturonic acid (trigalUA) substrate and compared its activity with its closely related cytoplasmic family 2 homolog, YePL2B. Cloning, Gene Expression, and Protein Production and Purification—The open reading frames encoding YePL2A and YePL2B were identified in the genome sequence of Y. enterocolitica 8081 (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Y_enterocolitica/) using the full-length Yersinia pestis CO92 family 2 pectate lyase gene sequences available within the CAZy data base (www.cazy.org) (19Coutinho P.M.

PCR primers were designed based on the Y. enterocolitica 8081 sequences, and in the case of YePL2A, the N-terminal sequence tag that was identified using SignalP (20Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5641) Google Scholar) was omitted. The gene fragment encoding YePL2A was amplified with CATATGGCTAGCGCGGATACCGACCGCCTG (YePL2A forward primer) and GAATTCCTCGAGTTATTTACGGCCGTTCGGTTG (YePL2A reverse primer). Likewise, the gene fragment encoding YePL2B was amplified with CATATGATGGATTTTATAGGCAACATTAAA (YePL2B forward primer) and GAATTCCTCGACTGATTCAAAAGCGTCGGATAA (YePL2B reverse primer). Y. enterocolitica subspecies enterocolitica 8081 genomic DNA (ATCC 9610D; Sigma) was used as a template. The amplified DNA fragments were cloned via the engineered 5′ NheI and 3′ XhoI restriction sites into identically digested pET28a to yield the plasmids pETPL2A and pETPL2B, which encode the YePL2A and YePL2B proteins, respectively, fused to N-terminal 6-histidine tag by thrombin protease cleavage sites. All PCR, cloning, and protein production and purification protocols for YePL2A and YePL2B have been described previously in detail for other proteins (21Boraston A.B. Creagh A.L. Alam M.M.

Enzyme Assays—Optimal pHs for YePL2A and YePL2B were determined in reactions adapted from Shevchik et al. (22Shevchik V.E. Condemine G. Robert-Baudouy J. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3912-3919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by incubating 0.05% polygalacturonic acid and 1 mm trigalUA, respectively, with 10 nm of enzyme. The reactions were monitored at 232 nm for the formation of unsaturated bonds in a broad range of pH conditions (6Pickersgill R. Smith D. Worboys K. Jenkins J. J. Biol.

Subsequently, a more accurate analysis was determined by performing a stepwise scan with intervals increasing by 0.2 pH units using buffers: Tris-HCl (8.0-8.8), CAPSO (9.0-9.8), and CAPS (10.0-11.0). The optimal pH conditions of 9.6 for YePL2A and 8.6 for YePL2B were then utilized for all subsequent enzyme activity experiments. Metal depletion assays were performed at optimal substrate concentrations (1 mm trigalUA) and run over a time course of 3 min. EDTA concentrations of 10 mm were used to ablate enzyme activity. Metal supplementation was analyzed at 40 mm final concentration. Substrate specificities were determined by incubating 10 nm enzyme with increasing amounts of substrate dissolved in deionized sterilized water. All of the runs lasted 3 min and were performed in triplicate for statistical significance. Product quantification was performed using an extinction coefficient of 5,200 m−1 (22Shevchik V.E. Condemine G. Robert-Baudouy J. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3912-3919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Product profiling was performed by analyzing products generated from YePL2A and YePL2B (1 μm) digestion of a 1% solution of polygalacturonic acid dissolved in CAPSO, pH 9.0. The reactions were stopped with EDTA and flash frozen. The product samples were subsequently thawed and loaded directly onto a DIONEX™ HPAEC instrument fitted with a CarboPac PA-20 column (060142; DIONEX, Sunnydale, CA) and pulsed ampometric detection. The retention times were determined in a filtered 0-1% NaOAc gradient, in 0.1 m NaOH using saturated mono-, di-, and trigalUA as standards (not shown). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Phasing of YePL2A—All of the crystallizations were done by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. YePL2A at 15 mg/ml was crystallized in 30% polyethylene glycol 1500 and 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.0. X-ray diffraction data of native YePL2A were collected at 113 K by freezing the crystal directly in the cryo-stream after a brief soak in mother liquor supplemented with 10% ethylene glycol. Iodide derivatization of YePL2A was achieved by growing crystals in the above condition with 10% ethylene glycol and 0.1 m NaI. These crystals were then soaked for 1 h in mother liquor containing 10% ethylene glycol and 1.0 m NaI. The soaked crystals were mounted directly in the cryo-stream. Diffraction data were collected with a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ area detector coupled to a MM-002 x-ray generator with Osmic “blue” optics and an Oxford Cryostream 700 cryo-cooler. The data were processed using Crystal Clear/d*trek (23Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Using both anomalous and isomorphous signal ShelxD (24Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) found seven iodide sites that were used for phasing by SIRAS within SHARP. Examination of the residual maps after heavy atom refinement and phasing yielded the positions of 11 additional iodide sites. Refinement of the 18 partially occupied iodide sites using data to 1.9 Å yielded isomorphous phasing powers of 0.9 and 1.0 for centric and acentric reflections, respectively, and an anomalous phasing power of 1.2. Figure-of-merits were 0.3 and 0.4 for centric and acentric reflections, respectively. Solvent flatting with a solvent content of 55% resulted in a figure-of-merit of 0.8. ARP/wARP (25Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar) was able to correctly build a virtually complete model with docked side chains. The model was completed manually and refined against the 1.5 Å data with REFMAC (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar).Water molecules were added using the ARP/wARP (25Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar) option within REFMAC and inspected visually prior to deposition. In all of the data sets, 5% of the observations were flagged as “free” (27Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar) and used to monitor refinement procedures. Manual model building was performed using COOT (28Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23387) Google Scholar) and refinements using REFMAC. The substrate complex was generated by soaking crystals grown in the same conditions as the native crystals (i.e. without NaI) with 1 m trigalUA for 2 h. The structure was solved by refining the apo form model against the complex data set. The trigalacturonic ligand was manually built using COOT. Water molecules were added as above. The metal-complexed form of YePL2A was crystallized in 25% polyethylene glycol 1500 without buffer. This crystal was mounted directly in the cryo-stream without cryo-protection. This structure was subsequently solved by molecular replacement using MolRep (29Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and the apo form coordinates as a search model. The conformation of the protein was sufficiently different to require rebuilding of large parts of the model. This was achieved using ARP/wARP, which was able to correctly build a virtually complete model with docked side chains. Manual completion of the model and addition of waters was performed as above. All of the data collection, processing, and final model statistics are given in Table 1. The structure factors and atomic coordinates for the NaI derivative, the trigalUA complex, and the metal-bound form have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank under codes 2V8I, 2V8K, and 2V8J, respectively.TABLE 1Crystallization and refinement statisticsNativeNaITrigalUANo bufferData collectionSpace groupP212121P212121P212121P212121Cell dimensionsa, b, and c (Å)58.3, 95.9, 126.558.5, 95.6, 126.658.4, 95.1, 127.468.0, 77.7, 103.5Resolution (Å)20.00-1.90 (1.97-1.90)19.85-1.50 (1.55-1.50)19.87-2.10 (2.17-2.10)19.91-2.00 (2.07-2.00)Rmerge0.062 (0.364)0.053 (0.359)0.089 (0.414)0.091 (0.371)I/σI10.7 (2.7)11.5 (2.9)8.6 (2.4)8.5 (2.9)Completeness (%)99.1 (99.3)97.4 (92.2)94.6 (98.8)93.2 (97.8)Redundancy4.1 (3.9)3.6 (2.8)4.4 (4.2)4.4 (4.0)RefinementResolution (Å)1.502.102.00No. reflections105592174522153616Rwork/Rfree0.22/0.240.19/0.260.21/0.25No. atomsProtein436243324262Ligand/ion50 (I)37 (ADA)1 (Mn)Water760589346B-factorsProtein18.528.924.6Ligand/ion17.650.818.5Water34.239.924.9Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0090.0110.012Bond angles (°)1.1441.2841.25Ramachandran valuesMost favored91.9%91.9%91.6%Additionally allowed7.9%7.9%8.2%Generously allowed0.2%0.2%0.2%Disallowed0.0%0.0%0.0% Open table in a new tab Enzyme Activity of Family 2 Pectate Lyases—YePL2A displayed a pH optimum of 9.6 on polygalaturonic acid, whereas YePL2B was most efficient on trigalUA at pH 8.6 (Fig. 1, top left panel). This observation is suggestive of adaptation to their different cellular localizations. To characterize their metal dependences, purified enzyme was utilized in a control reaction, and then activity was ablated with EDTA. The inhibited reactions were next supplemented with various transition metals, and the activity was monitored at 232 nm to detect the generation of unsaturated products. Although YePL2A activity was ablated upon the addition of EDTA (not shown), supplementation with various metals resulted in precipitation and prohibited the accurate measurement of activity. In contrast, the closely related YePL2B performed well in this assay and clearly displayed the highest recovery of activity in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 1, top right panel). To analyze the product profiles of YePL2A and YePL2B, polygalacturonic acid was digested with each enzyme, and the products were analyzed by HPAEC. YePL2A produced both saturated and unsaturated oligogalacturonides with varying degrees of polymerization from 2-5 subunits in length (Fig. 1, middle left panel). Y. enterocolitica was previously determined to have an endo-acting pectate lyase; however, within this report there was no reported DNA or protein sequence (30Liao C.H. Revear L. Hotchkiss A. Savary B. Can. J. Microbiol. 1999; 45: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest that YePL2A is indeed the enzyme in this original report. In contrast, YePL2B almost exclusively produced unsaturated digalacturonic acid, indicating its exo-acting mode of activity (Fig. 1, middle right panel). This was consistent with its similarity to the PelW enzyme from Erwinia chrysanthemi, which was previously identified as an exo-acting pectate lyase (31Shevchik V.E. Kester H.C. Benen J.A. Visser J. Robert-Baudouy J. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1652-1663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A more thorough kinetic analysis of the activity of these two enzymes on trigalUA and polygalacturonic acid revealed that these enzymes are optimally active on carbohydrates with different degrees of polymerization. YePL2A is preferentially active upon polygalacturonic acid and YePL2B on trigalUA (Fig. 1, bottom left and right panels). Interestingly, both YePL2A and YePL2B appear to display substrate inhibition profiles (Fig. 1, bottom left and right panels), which is not uncommon for pectate lyases (32Benen J.A. Kester H.C. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 33Roy C. Kester H. Visser J. Shevchik V. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Robert-Baudouy J. Benen J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3705-3709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted localization of YePL2A and YePL2B within the pectin utilization pathway is consistent with their observed activities. Polygalacturonic acid is predicted to be bound by the periplasmic protein YeCBM32, which likely functions to retain the polysaccharide within the periplasm (16Abbott D.W. Hrynuik S. Boraston A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Polygalacturonic acid is then depolymerized by YePL2A (YePL2A is active on polygalacturonic acid that is complexed by YeCBM32; data not shown) and YeGH28 to produce small oligogalacturonides 2-3 residues in length (17Abbott D.W. Boraston A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar). These products are the preferential ligands for TogB, the specificity determinant of the intracellular transporter TogMNAB (18Abbott D.W. Boraston A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar). Within the cell, YePL2B would therefore only be presented with smaller substrates and likely operates in a “clean-up” role to convert residual trigalUA into 4,5-unsaturated digalacturonic acid. This end product is the substrate for the downstream oligogalacturonate lyase, Ogl (22Shevchik V.E. Condemine G. Robert-Baudouy J. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3912-3919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which catalyzes the β-elimination of saturated and unsaturated digalacturonides and initiates the final stages of intracellular pectin catabolism. The preferential activity of YePL2B on trigalUA over PGA, therefore, is in agreement with its inherent exo-activity. The higher activity on the smaller substrate observed is due to the higher molar ratio of terminal ends. The Overall Structure of YePL2A—The structure of YePL2A was solved by Iodine-SIRAS to a resolution of 1.5 Å and refined with R and Rfree values of 0.22 and 0.24, respectively (see Table 1 for all data and structure statistics). The core of this enzyme consists of a rare (α/α)7 barrel fold (Fig. 2A), which documents the first time this structure has been found in a prokaryotic protein. The (α/α)7 nomenclature refers to the packing of two antiparallel α-helices, each ranging from ∼10 to 20 amino acids in length, into seven substructures arranged in a counterclockwise manner that constitutes the core of the barrel. This α-barrel appears to function as a structural platform upon which are “grafted” two large arms, which harness the catalytic machinery. These arms consist predominantly of β-strands and define the walls of the active site channel, giving the enzyme an overall “vice-like” shape (Fig. 2B). The distance running between the two arms is ∼15 Å across and ∼50 Å long, easily large enough to accommodate an oligogalacturonide substrate. The channel is open at both ends, consistent with its observed endo-mode of action (see below). The (α/α)7 barrel fold has only been previously reported for the family 47 glycoside hydrolases (GH47) (34Vallee F. Lipari F. Yip P. Sleno B. Herscovics A. Howell P.L.

Chem. 2005; 280: 16197-16207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, C and D). These enzymes are exclusive eukaryotic mannosidases involved in N-glycan maturation and quality control during glycoprotein synthesis (38Herscovics A. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition to the difference in the biological function of these enzymes, they operate by completely different mechanisms and are active upon stereochemically distinct substrates. Pectate lyases cleave glycosidic linkages by abstraction of the aglycon H5 and generate a planar product with an unsaturated bond between C-4 and C-5. GH47s cleave glycosidic linkages by the addition of water, resulting in stereochemical inversion around the anomeric carbon. The GH47 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScGH47; Protein Data Bank code 1DL2) and YePL2A superimpose with a root mean square deviation of ∼3.1 Å for 310 aligned Cα. Beyond the core of these enzymes, however, there is little structural similarity. The catalytic machinery of ScGH47 is buried within the core of the (α/α)7 barrel in contrast to the position of the YePL2A active site, which is positioned off-center and above the α-barrel between the arms of the vice. Also GH47 binds a calcium ion at a noticeably different site than the coordination pocket of the pectate lyase (Fig. 2, C and D). In light of this functional and structural distinction, the phylogeny of this protein fold is difficult to rationalize. Indeed the selective pressures driving the diversification of such unique and specialized enzymes, differing substantially in both substrate specificity and mechanism, are not readily clear. It does suggest, however, that although very few enzymes displaying an (α/α)7 barrel have been discovered, this fold is a useful scaffold for carbohydrate active enzymes, an observation that has also been noted for the (α/α)6 toroid family 10 pectate lyases (10Charnock S.J. Brown I.E. Turkenburg J.P. Black G.W. Davies G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12067-12072Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Active Site Architecture—Soaking the inactive YePL2A crystals obtained in the presence of citrate buffer with trigalUA produced a substrate complex with good electron density into which a trigalUA molecule could be unambiguously modeled (Fig. 3A). Analogous experiments with the crystals of the metal-bound form resulted in disintegration of the crystal, which is likely due to the extremely fragile nature of these crystals. The YePL2A active site is positioned at the end of the active cleft, and the intact trigalUA substrate is oriented with its aglycon moiety in contact with the catalytic machinery (Fig. 3A). Analysis of the molecular contacts between YePL2A and trigalUA revealed the presence of three subsites (Fig. 3A); however, this analysis was limited by the substrate size, and quite possibly there are further subsites along the enzyme cleft that would increase its specificity for sugars with a larger degree of polymerization. Subsite +1 (occupied by the leaving group) is primarily composed of the catalytic residues. These include Arg171, which is the putative Brønstead base positioned within 2.9 Å of the aglycon C-5 with satisfactory geometry; and the stabilizing arginine Arg272, which binds both the hydroxyl groups of C-2 and C-3. The uronate group of the sugar residue in the +1 subsite is bound by Glu130 and Glu515 and the amine group of Lys132. At subsite -1 and -2, there are surprisingly few interactions between the substrate and the enzyme, and no detectable salt bridges that may be explained because of the inactivated state of the enzyme. Indeed, it is quite possible that the conformational changes observed upon metal binding and potential for metal coordination with the substrate uronate groups may increase the enzyme specificity for substrate by forming additional interactions. Under these crystallization conditions, hydrogen bonds where detected between Asn203, Lys132, and Tyr248 and the uronate oxygens of the sugar in subsite -1 and also between the O-2 and Arg530 in subsite -2. In light of these structural data, we next compared the primary structures of YePL2A and YePL2B to determine whether it could explain the differences in activity between the two enzymes. The amino acid alignment demonstrates a reasonably good level of amino acid identity (37%) throughout and the strict conservation of the amino acids predicted to be involved in catalysis (supplemental Fig. 1). The most noticeable difference between the two lyases is an insertion of several amino acids between stands β7 and β8 of YePL2B. When this insertion is mapped to the three-dimensional structure of YePL2A, it is positioned near the end of the active site that interacts with the reducing end of the sugar, where it may function to close off the channel (Fig. 3, B and C). It is easy to envision that such a mechanism may limit the accessibility of the substrate to only +1 and +2 subsites, providing a structural explanation for the exclusive production of digalacturonides by YePL2B (Fig. 1, middle left panel). Active site transformation from an endo-acting channel to an exo-acting pocket by loop insertions is a well documented phenomenon within glycoside hydrolases, and we have recently reported such a mechanism to explain the structural basis of exopolygalacturonase activity in the family 28 glycoside hydrolases (17Abbott D.W. Boraston A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar); however, less is known about pectate lyases. Unfortunately, further structural analysis of YePL2B by x-ray crystallography has been unsuccessful because of difficulties with protein production and solubility. The Unique Metal-binding Pocket of Family 2 Pectate Lyases—When crystallized in the presence of citrate buffer (i.e. the native and trigalUA complexed forms),"
https://openalex.org/W1964990709,"Proxies from Greenland ice cores and North Atlantic marine sediment cores document repeated extreme climate swings of a few decades to millennia during the last glacial cycle, including periods of intense ice rafting called Heinrich events (HEs). We have found similar oxygen isotope variations recorded in mixed-layer-and thermocline-dwelling planktonic foraminifera during HEs 0, 1, and 4, suggesting that three foraminiferal taxa calcified their shells at similar temperatures in a homogenized upperwater column. This implies that the surface mixed layer was deeper during HEs. Similar deepening occurred on the northern margin of the ice-rafted-debris belt, implying that these deep mixed layers during HEs were widespread in the region. We suggest that an increase in storminess during HEs intensified the vertical mixing of meltwater from ice rafting in the upper ocean."

The monoclonal antibody WF6, developed against embryonic shark cartilage CS, recognizes an epitope in CS chains, which is expressed in ovarian cancer and variably in joint diseases. To elucidate the structure of the epitope, we isolated oligosaccharide fractions from a partial chondroitinase ABC digest of shark cartilage CS-C and established their chain length, disaccharide composition, sulfate content, and sulfation pattern. These structurally defined oligosaccharide fractions were characterized for binding to WF6 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an oligosaccharide microarray prepared with CS oligosaccharides derivatized with a fluorescent aminolipid. The lowest molecular weight fraction recognized by WF6 contained octasaccharides, which were split into five subfractions. The most reactive subfraction contained several distinct octasaccharide sequences. Two octasaccharides, ΔD-C-C-C and ΔC-C-A-D (where A represents GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate), C is GlcUAβ1-3Gal-NAc(6-O-sulfate), D is GlcUA(2-O-sulfate)β1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate), ΔCis Δ4,5HexUAα1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate), and ΔDis Δ4,5HexUA(2-O-sulfate)α1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)), were recognized by WF6, but other related octasaccharides, ΔC-A-D-C and ΔC-C-C-C, were not. The structure and sequences of both the binding and nonbinding octasaccharides were compared by computer modeling, which revealed a remarkable similarity between the shape and distribution of the electrostatic potential in the two different octasaccharide sequences that bound to WF6 and that differed from the nonbinding octasaccharides. The strong similarity in structure predicted for the two binding CS octasaccharides (ΔD-C-C-C and ΔC-C-A-D) provided a possible explanation for their similar affinity for WF6, although they differed in sequence and thus form two specific mimetopes for the antibody.

These structurally defined oligosaccharide fractions were characterized for binding to WF6 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an oligosaccharide microarray prepared with CS oligosaccharides derivatized with a fluorescent aminolipid. The lowest molecular weight fraction recognized by WF6 contained octasaccharides, which were split into five subfractions. The most reactive subfraction contained several distinct octasaccharide sequences. Two octasaccharides, ΔD-C-C-C and ΔC-C-A-D (where A represents GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate), C is GlcUAβ1-3Gal-NAc(6-O-sulfate), D is GlcUA(2-O-sulfate)β1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate), ΔCis Δ4,5HexUAα1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate), and ΔDis Δ4,5HexUA(2-O-sulfate)α1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)), were recognized by WF6, but other related octasaccharides, ΔC-A-D-C and ΔC-C-C-C, were not. The structure and sequences of both the binding and nonbinding octasaccharides were compared by computer modeling, which revealed a remarkable similarity between the shape and distribution of the electrostatic potential in the two different octasaccharide sequences that bound to WF6 and that differed from the nonbinding octasaccharides. The strong similarity in structure predicted for the two binding CS octasaccharides (ΔD-C-C-C and ΔC-C-A-D) provided a possible explanation for their similar affinity for WF6, although they differed in sequence and thus form two specific mimetopes for the antibody. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CS-PGs) 5The abbreviations used are: CS, chondroitin sulfate; PG, proteoglycan; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; GlcUA, d-glucuronic acid; HexUA, hexuronic acid; IdoUA, l-iduronic acid; 2S, 2-O-sulfate; 4S, 4-O-sulfate; 6S, 6-O-sulfate; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; SAX, strong anion exchange resin; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; 2AB, 2-aminobenzamide; ADHP, N-aminoacetyl-N-(9-anthracenylmethyl)-1,2-dihexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine. are expressed on the surface of most cells and in extracellular matrices in vertebrates, where CS is linked to a wide range of core protein families. They are increasingly implicated as important regulators of many biological processes, contributing in various ways to the physical strength of tissues, cell adhesion, and signal transduction (1Letourneau P.C.

CS chains have a considerable structural variability, the biological functions of which are not well understood. The structure is an unbranched polymer linked through a unique tetrasaccharide (GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl) to a serine residue in a PG and is composed of repeating disaccharides (-4GlcUAβ1-3GalNAcβ1-)n, which can be modified by O-sulfation reactions at various positions, where GlcUA and GalNAc represent d-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, respectively. CS is expressed in tissue- and cell-specific forms generated by varying patterns of sulfation, epimerization, and chain length, which may account for some of the functional diversity and specificity of PGs to which they are attached. The sulfation pattern of CS varies with aging in cartilage (5Brown M.P. West L.A. Merritt K.A. Plaas A.H. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1998; 59: 786-791PubMed Google Scholar). CS-D and CS-E, which contain specific disulfated disaccharide units, promote the neurite outgrowth of hippocampal and mesencephalic neurons (4Sugahara K. Mikami T. Uyama U. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K.

Sulfation is closely related to key steps in biosynthesis, including chain elongation and termination (9Kitagawa H. Ujikawa M. Tsutsumi K. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been generated that recognize specific features of CS chains (10Caterson B. Griffin J. Mahmoodian F. Sorrell J.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but few of the epitopes have been characterized in detail (11Ito Y. Hikino M. Yajima Y.

Studies with anti-CS mAbs have revealed restricted spatio-temporal patterns of expression in various tissues during growth and development and in pathological conditions (14Sorrell J.M. Mahmoodian F.

The use of antibodies that recognize epitopes on CS chains is becoming more widely used in many fields of biomedical research, such as tissue growth and development (16Fernaud-Espinosa I. Nieto-Sampedro M. Bovolenta P. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 30: 410-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and also in the diagnosis of diseases (18Johnson K.A. Hay C.W. Chu Q. Roe S.C. Caterson B.

Hardingham T. Kongtawelert P. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 140: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Studies of experimental canine osteoarthritis cartilage revealed that early in diseases there were distinctive changes in the CS epitopes long before there was any cartilage destruction (20Pothacharoen P. Ong-Chai S. Supaphun J. Kumja P. Wanaphirak C. Sugahara K. Hardingham T. Kongtawelert P. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 140: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Changes in the sulfation of CS were also reported in the PG fragments found in synovial fluid following joint trauma (21Hazell P.K. Dent C. Fairclough J.A. Bayliss M.T. Hardingham T.E. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Measuring CS epitopes in cartilage metabolites in body fluids of patients with arthritis (22Lohmander L.S. Acta Orthop.

Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 782-785PubMed Google Scholar) therefore has potential for monitoring the progression and severity of the disease. WF6 is a mouse IgM type mAb with κ-chains, generated using embryonic shark cartilage CS-PGs as immunogen. It is reactive with shark CS-PGs, and the epitope was also detected in commercial CS preparations (CS-C and CS-D) from shark cartilage, but the antibody is unreactive with other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (25Kongtawelert, P., Hardingham, T., Ong-chai, S., Sugahara, K., Pothacharoen, P., and Tiengburanathum, N. (December 15, 2005) WO Patent WO2005118645.Google Scholar). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has shown that this mAb detected an increased level of WF6 epitope in serum samples from patients of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (19Pothacharoen P. Teekachunhatean S. Louthrenoo W. Yingsung W. Ong-Chai S. Hardingham T. Kongtawelert P. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2006; 14: 299-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and in those of ovarian cancer (20Pothacharoen P. Ong-Chai S. Supaphun J. Kumja P. Wanaphirak C. Sugahara K. Hardingham T. Kongtawelert P. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 140: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The established specificity of the antibody and its restricted distribution among CS chains has suggested that the epitope is a specific sequence found in some but not all CS chains and is composed of sulfated disaccharides, including A unit (GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)), C unit (GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)), and D unit (GlcUA(2-O-sulfate)β1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)). It was thus important to determine its structure and to understand if such sequences have specific biological functions, as in the case of those recognized by other anti-CS mAbs, including CS-56 and MO-225 (11Ito Y. Hikino M. Yajima Y. Mikami T. Sirko S. von H.A. Faissner A. Fukui S. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) as well as anti-dermatan sulfate mAb 2A12 (12Bao X. Pavão M.S.G. dos Santos J.C. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23184-23193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Several studies have investigated the structure of CS chains on PGs from various tissues, but comprehensive methods to determine sulfation sequences do not exist. Progress has therefore been made using mAbs directed to CS (26Sorrell J.M. Carrino D.A. Caplan A.I. Matrix. 1993; 13: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3296-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The epitopes recognized by such mAbs are either sequences containing sulfated disaccharides in native CS chains (14Sorrell J.M. Mahmoodian F. Schafer I.A. Davis B. Caterson B. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30Avnur Z. Geiger B. Cell. 1984; 38: 811-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 31Mark M.P. Butler W.T. Ruch J.V. Dev. Biol. 1989; 133: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or unnatural structures with nonreducing terminal unsaturated uronic acid in the chains, which are created by digestion with chondroitinase ABC (32Caterson B. Hughes C.E. Roughley P. Mort J.S. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 266: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The mAb WF6, which recognizes a native epitope on CS chains (25Kongtawelert, P., Hardingham, T., Ong-chai, S., Sugahara, K., Pothacharoen, P., and Tiengburanathum, N. (December 15, 2005) WO Patent WO2005118645.Google Scholar), has been found useful in investigating changes in pathological conditions. These results have provided evidence that the expression of the WF6 epitope within CS-PGs is regulated and therefore that the generation of such sequences is not a consequence of random sulfation. Characterization of the epitope is thus essential to understand the biological function of these specific chain sequences and the processes that regulate their expression. To define the key structural features of the CS that are recognized by the mAb WF6, we have isolated and characterized a range of variously sized oligosaccharide fragments from CS-C of shark cartilage and successfully defined two mimetope octasaccharide sequences that are recognized by the mAb. Furthermore, these octasaccharides were analyzed by computer modeling and simulation to reveal their common structural features. Previously, the effectiveness of molecular modeling was shown (13Blanchard V. Chevalier F. Imberty A. Leeflang B.R. Basappa Sugahara K. Kamerling J.P. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1167-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The most stable and the second best stable conformations of the CS octasaccharides recognized by mAbs CS-56, MO-225, and 473HD were very similar with subtle energy difference and were in good agreement with the structure determined by NMR spectroscopy. However, the accuracy of the used geometry optimization at a classical mechanics level is not sufficient for predicting intermolecular interaction zones, because charge values are fixed even when a conformation change is brought about. Therefore, in this study, intrinsic properties of the octasaccharides recognized by mAb WF6 were analyzed at a quantum mechanics level, which gives much more accurate information. The stable structures sampled and optimized adequately by energy minimizations in force field calculations were used as the initial structures in the semiempirical molecular orbital calculations to solve the electronic structure. Thus, we could derive the intermolecular interaction zones and ESP charges caused by the zones and reveal the critical zones in the octasaccharide sequences. Comparison of the ESP charges and zones of the preferred and nonpreferred octasaccharides successfully demonstrated the common interaction zones and predicted the molecular recognition mechanisms. Materials—CS-C from shark cartilage and chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) from Proteus vulgaris were purchased from Sigma. 6-O-Sulfatase or 4-O-sulfatase was purchased from Seikagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Bio-Gel P6 was from Bio-Rad. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma, Merck, or Roche Applied Science unless specified otherwise. The mAb WF6, which was produced using embryonic shark cartilage CS-PGs as immunogen in mice (25Kongtawelert, P., Hardingham, T., Ong-chai, S., Sugahara, K., Pothacharoen, P., and Tiengburanathum, N. (December 15, 2005) WO Patent WO2005118645.Google Scholar), is an IgM mAb with κ-light chain and is reactive with the CS-PG in the A1D1 fraction, derived from shark cartilage (S-A1D1) (25Kongtawelert, P., Hardingham, T., Ong-chai, S., Sugahara, K., Pothacharoen, P., and Tiengburanathum, N. (December 15, 2005) WO Patent WO2005118645.Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase conjugated with the secondary antibody against mouse IgM was obtained from Sigma. Shark cartilage CS-antigens A1 and A1D1 fractions were prepared and purified as previously reported (33Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1980-1989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation and Fractionation of CS Oligosaccharide Fragments—The commercial CS-C preparation from shark cartilage was partially depolymerized by controlled digestion with chondroitinase ABC. In brief, 1 g of CS-C was digested with 5 units of the enzyme in 5 ml of 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.06 m CH3COONa at 37 °C overnight. The digest was desalted on a short column of Sephadex G-10 and fractionated on a column (1.6 × 100 cm) of Bio-Gel P-6 in 0.2 m ammonium acetate at a flow rate 15 ml/h. The lowest molecular weight fraction (fraction C6), which competed with the binding of WF6, was subfractionated on a short MonoQ FPLC cartridge column (5 ml) of strong anion exchange resin (SAX) (Amersham Biosciences) with detection at 232 nm. The yield of fraction C6 from1gof CS-C was 13 mg, and a portion (11 mg) was used for the purification. Elution was carried out using a linear gradient of LiClO4 from 0 to 0.25 m over 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. One-ml fractions were collected. The subfractions were desalted on a short PD-10 column of Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) and lyophilized. Determination of the molecular mass of the oligosaccharide in each subfraction was carried out by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), and quantitation was made by the carbazole reaction for uronic acid using GlcUA as a standard (34Bitter M. Muir H. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). Delayed Extraction MALDI-TOF MS—Delayed extraction MALDI-TOF MS of oligosaccharide fractions were acquired in a Voyager DE-RP/Pro Biospectrometry Workstation (Per-Septive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in a linear mode. Gentisic acid (Sigma) was used as the matrix at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in water. A synthetic peptide (Arg-Gly)15 was used as a complexing agent to shield the negatively charged groups of the sulfated oligosaccharides (35Juhasz P. Biemann K. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 270: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). An aqueous solution of (Arg-Gly)15 (10 pmol/μl) was first mixed with 10 pmol of each oligosaccharide fraction and then with 1 μl of the matrix solution. The mixture was placed on the probe surface, dried under a stream of air, and used for the measurement of the spectrum. Derivatization of Reducing Oligosaccharides with 2-Aminobenzamide—The derivatization of oligosaccharides with a fluorophore 2-aminobenzamide (2AB) was performed essentially as described by Bigge et al. (36Bigge J.C. Patel T.P. Bruce J.A. Goulding P.N. Charles S.M. Parekh R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1-0.5 nmol of a given oligosaccharide was lyophilized in a microcentrifuge tube. An aliquot (5 μl) of a derivatization reagent solution (0.35 m 2AB, 0.1 m NaCNBH4, 30% (v/v) acetic acid in dimethyl sulfoxide) was added to the oligosaccharide sample, and the mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 2 h. The derivatized oligosaccharide was purified by paper chromatography using Whatman 3 MM paper in a solvent system of butanol/ethanol/water (4:1:1, v/v/v). HPLC—The fractionation and analysis of unsaturated oligosaccharides were performed by anion exchange HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA-03 column with a linear gradient of NaH2PO4 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at room temperature as described for the separation of CS disaccharides and tetrasaccharides (37Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Eluates were monitored using an RF-10AXL fluorometric detector (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 330 and 420 nm, respectively. Unsaturated oligosaccharides (0.3-1.0-nmol aliquots) unlabeled with 2AB were monitored by absorbance at 232 nm. Strategy for Exosequencing of CS-C Octasaccharide—Each octasaccharide fraction (30 pmol) was derivatized with 2AB. The excess 2AB reagent was removed by paper chromatography, and an aliquot (5 pmol) of the 2AB-derivatized octasaccharide fraction was digested with chondroitinase ABC or AC-II and analyzed by anion exchange HPLC on an amine-bound silica column to identify the disaccharide units to be released from the reducing side (step one). Another digest (5 pmol) with chondroitinase ABC or AC-II of each digest was labeled with 2AB again, purified by paper chromatography, and analyzed by anion exchange HPLC to identify the disaccharide units to be released from the nonreducing end and the penultimate position of the octasaccharide (see Scheme 1). Competitive ELISA for WF6—Purified shark aggrecan aggregate (A1 fraction) was absorbed overnight on a polystyrene Maxisorp® plate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at 10 μg/ml in 0.2 m NaHCO3, pH 9.6 in 100 μl/well at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with 0.2 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the Tris buffer for 1 h at 37 °C.The coated wells were incubated with a mixture of mAb WF6 (1:20,000) with a standard (the A1D1 fraction of shark cartilage aggrecan) or a sample in blocking reagent for 1 h at 37 °C. For competition studies, mAb WF6 was preincubated with different GAGs (CS polysaccharide or oligosaccharide) for 1 h at 37 °C at various concentrations (see “Results”) and added to the immobilized A1 fraction in the presence of soluble competitors. The plates were washed three times with the Tris buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with specific anti-mouse IgM (μ-chain) secondary antibodies coupled with horseradish peroxidase diluted 2,000-fold in the Tris buffer. After washing three times, the plates were developed with ortho-phenylenediamine (Sigma). The colored reaction product was quantified in an ELISA reader Titertek Multiscan (Flow Laboratories, Mecklenheim, Germany) by absorbance OD at 452 nm. Experiments were performed in duplicate. The percentage inhibition was calculated as follows: percentage inhibition = 100 - (((ODtest - ODblank)/(ODcontrol - ODblank)) × 100). Derivatization of CS-derived Oligosaccharide with Fluorescent Aminolipid—CS-C oligosaccharides were coupled to N-aminoacetyl-N-(9-anthracenylmethyl)-1,2-dihexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (ADHP), synthesized from anthracenaldehyde and 1,2-dihexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, giving an intense fluorescence under UV light as described previously (38Yamaguchi K. Tamaki H. Fukui S. Glycoconj. J. 2006; 23: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, a dried oligosaccharide fraction (2 nmol as oligosaccharide) was mixed with 6 nmol of ADHP in chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:1, v/v/v). The reaction mixture was sonicated in a bath, heated at 60 °C for 2 h. Tetrabutylammonium cyanoborohydride (100 nmol in 2 μl of methanol) was added, and after sonication for 5 min, the mixture was incubated at 60 °C for 72 h. The reaction mixture was dried in a vacuum concentrator and dissolved in chloroform/methanol/water (25:25:8, v/v/v) and purified by thin layer chromatography in a solvent system of chloroform, methanol, 0.2 m CaCl2 (105:10:28, v/v/v) for oligosaccharide microarray analysis. CS Oligosaccharide Microarrays—The preparation of CS-C oligosaccharide microarrays was carried out as described previously (38Yamaguchi K. Tamaki H. Fukui S. Glycoconj. J. 2006; 23: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, CS-C oligosaccharides derivatized with the fluorescent lipid were dissolved in chloroform, methanol, 0.2 m CaCl2 (105:10:28, v/v/v) and applied onto a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) as 2-mm width bands by jet spray using a sample applicator (Linomat V; Camag) at a spotting rate of 70 nl/s. Each membrane was blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 1 h and overlaid with mouse IgM mAb WF6 diluted 500-fold in 3% (w/v) BSA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 2 h. The membranes were rinsed several times with 3% (w/v) BSA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and overlaid for 1 h with anti-mouse IgM conjugated with horseradish peroxidase diluted 3,000-fold with 3% (w/v) BSA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The binding of the antibody was visualized using FAST 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Determination of Uronic Acid—GlcUA was determined with a colorimetric assay using the carbazole reaction (34Bitter M. Muir H. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar) with GlcUA as a standard. Unsaturated uronic acid was quantified spectrophotometrically based on an average millimolar absorption cofficient of 5.5 at 232 nm (40Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the Dihedral Angles of CS Disaccharides Determined at the Local Energy Minima—The dihedral angles (φ, ψ) of a given CS disaccharide largely determine its conformation. The dihedral angles (φ, ψ) of the local energy minima were calculated for the five disaccharide subunits included in the above octasaccharides: GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate), GlcUAβ1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate), GlcUA(2-O-sulfate)β1-3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate), GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)β1-4GlcUA(2-O-sulfate), and GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)β1-4GlcUA. The previous study (13Blanchard V. Chevalier F. Imberty A. Leeflang B.R. Basappa Sugahara K. Kamerling J.P.

Chevalier F. Imberty A. Leeflang B.R. Basappa Sugahara K. Kamerling J.P. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1167-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, to obtain the φ and ψ values of the local minimum conformations of the above disaccharides, the 24 conformations in each disaccharide in the range of 40-330° and 60-330° were chosen, and full geometry optimizations were performed using the semiempirical molecular orbital calculations with the Accelrys Materials Studio module (available on the World Wide Web), taking the solvent effects into consideration. Likewise, the dihedral angles of the disaccharide constituents of the other CS octasaccharides were determined. Molecular Modeling and Computational Analyses—Molecular dynamics and semiempirical molecular orbital calculations were performed to explain the biological activity of the four isolated oligosaccharides (ΔC-A-D-C, ΔC-C-C-C, ΔC-C-A-D, and ΔD-C-C-C). Their geometries were constructed using the Accelrys Materials Studio module (available on the World Wide Web), and their equilibrium structures were optimized by the anneal dynamics, consisting of a dynamics simulation, where the temperature was periodically increased from an initial temperature to a midcycle temperature and back again to the initial temperature using the Forcite module (41Rappe A.K.

https://openalex.org/W1988183389,"Disulfide bond formation in the endoplasmic reticulum is catalyzed by enzymes of the protein disulfide-isomerase family that harbor one or more thioredoxin-like domains. We recently discovered the transmembrane protein TMX3, a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase of the protein disulfide-isomerase family. Here, we show that the endoplasmic reticulum-luminal region of TMX3 contains three thioredoxin-like domains, an N-terminal redox-active domain (named a) followed by two enzymatically inactive domains (b and b′). Using the recombinantly expressed TMX3 domain constructs a, ab, and abb′, we compared structural stability and enzymatic properties. By structural and biophysical methods, we demonstrate that the reduced a domain has features typical of a globular folded domain that is, however, greatly destabilized upon oxidization. Importantly, interdomain stabilization by the b domain renders the a domain more resistant toward chemical denaturation and proteolysis in both the oxidized and reduced form. In combination with molecular modeling studies of TMX3 abb′, the experimental results provide a new understanding of the relationship between the multidomain structure of TMX3 and its function as a redox enzyme. Overall, the data indicate that in addition to their role as substrate and co-factor binding domains, redox-inactive thioredoxin-like domains also function in stabilizing neighboring redox-active domains.

Overall, the data indicate that in addition to their role as substrate and co-factor binding domains, redox-inactive thioredoxin-like domains also function in stabilizing neighboring redox-active domains. For many proteins of the secretory pathway and those targeted to the cell surface or secreted, correct folding depends on the formation of native disulfides. The formation of short range disulfide bonds found in some proteins likely requires little catalysis, whereas other proteins rely on the catalyzed formation and rearrangement of disulfides that must be introduced in a nontrivial pattern. The first ER enzyme found to promote these processes was PDI 3The abbreviations used are: PDI, protein disulfide-isomerase; DTT, dithio-1,4-threitol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Pdi1p, S. cerevisiae PDI; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. (1Givol D. Goldberger R.F. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: PC3114-PC3116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, PDI can catalyze oxidation of free cysteines as well as reduction and isomerization of incorrect disulfide bonds (2Creighton T.E. Hillson D.A. Freedman R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 142: 43-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 3Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Nature. 1993; 365: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 4Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7937-7947Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is now clear that a whole family of PDI-like proteins of almost 20 members exists in the mammalian ER (5Ellgaard L. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 6Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2006; 8: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The proteins of the PDI family all contain at least one domain with a thioredoxin fold, where the secondary structure elements are typically arranged as β1-α1-β2-α2-β3-α3-β4-β5-α4. Thioredoxin-like domains that encompass a reactive CXXC tetrapeptide sequence are classified as a-type domains and otherwise as b-type domains. For instance, PDI contains four thioredoxin-like domains named a, b, b′, and a′, where a and a′ are redox-active, and b and b′ show no such activity. The redoxactive domains generally show a high level of sequence conservation, whereas the b-type domains display comparatively little sequence similarity. The function of many b-type domains remains unknown. It is clear, however, that the b′ domain in PDI confers substrate binding (7Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and that the corresponding domain in ERp57, the closest homolog of PDI, interacts with the lectin chaperones calnexin and calreticulin that bind glycoprotein substrates (8Russell S.J. Ruddock L.W. Salo K.E. Oliver J.D. Roebuck Q.P. Llewellyn D.H. Roderick H.L. Koivunen P. Myllyharju J. High S. J. Biol.

Structure. 2006; 14: 1331-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PDI-like proteins with one or more a-type domains can oxidize free cysteine residues and reduce disulfides in in vitro assays. The same is the case for recombinantly expressed a-type domains in isolation (10Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2006; 8: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, at least in the case of PDI and ERp57, efficient isomerization requires the presence of one or more b-type domains (11Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 18277-18287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although PDI and ERp57 are quite well characterized and the crystal structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae PDI (Pdi1p) and a human ERp57 bb′ construct were recently solved (9Kozlov G. Maattanen P. Schrag J.D. Pollock S. Cygler M. Nagar B. Thomas D.Y. Gehring K. Structure. 2006; 14: 1331-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Tian G. Xiang S. Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. Schindelin H. Cell. 2006; 124: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), relatively little is known about the cellular functions performed by the human ER oxidoreductases. A plausible explanation for the presence of so many oxidoreductases in the same organelle is that individual PDI homologs interact with discrete or only partially overlapping sets of substrates. An indication that this is indeed the case comes from the recent finding that substrates of ERp57 generally belong to only a subset of glycoproteins characterized by multiple disulfides and a low level of regular secondary structure elements (15Jessop C.E. Chakravarthi S. Garbi N. Hämmerling G.J. Lovell S. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Most human PDIs are soluble, but four have a transmembrane region and are grouped in the TMX (thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein) subfamily (5Ellgaard L. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). No substrates are known for the TMX proteins, but it is tempting to speculate that their substrate selectivity is governed by the membrane association. All have a single a-type domain facing the ER lumen, except perhaps TMX2, for which the membrane orientation is unclear (16Meng X. Zhang C. Chen J. Peng S. Cao Y. Ying K. Xie Y. Mao Y. Biochem. Genet. 2003; 41: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). No experimental characterization has been published for TMX4. The TMX protein has thiol-disulfide exchange activity in vitro and can suppress brefeldin A-induced apoptosis when overexpressed (17Matsuo Y. Akiyama N. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Noda M. Kizaka-Kondoh S.

Sakakura-Nishiyama J. Yamaguchi Y. Masutani H. Ishii Y. Yodoi J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The protein in focus of the current study, TMX3, is expressed in a variety of human tissues, with the highest levels in heart and skeletal muscle (19Haugstetter J. Blicher T. Ellgaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8371-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The redox state of the active site cysteines in TMX3 is predominantly reduced in vivo (19Haugstetter J. Blicher T. Ellgaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8371-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), with ∼30% of TMX3 molecules present in the oxidized form (20Appenzeller-Herzog C. Ellgaard L. Antiox. Redox. Signal. 2007; 1010.1089/ars.2007.1837Google Scholar). Here, we have performed structural, biophysical, and biochemical studies of TMX3 to learn more about the structure-function relations in the protein. Notably, we find that in the three-domain structure of the protein, the redox-active N-terminal domain is stabilized considerably in the context of the full-length protein. Plasmids and Vectors—pRSET-miniT/TMX3lum (19Haugstetter J. Blicher T. Ellgaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8371-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was used for the expression of the entire ER luminal region of TMX3 (TMX3lum, residues 25-373; all TMX3 residue numbers in this study refer to the human sequence including the predicted signal peptide, accession number NP_061895). For the expression of TMX3 domain constructs containing one (TMX3 a; residues 25-131), two (TMX3 ab; residues 25-234), or three domains (TMX3 abb′; residues 25-344), the TMX3 cDNA clone hj01608 (KIAA1830 protein) obtained from Kazusa DNA Research Institute served as a PCR template. The forward primer 3-BAB4-Trx-3 (5′-GGGGGATCCAAAGGATTTGTAGAAGATTTAG-3′) was used for all constructs, and the following reverse primers were used to generate TMX3 a, TMX3 ab, and TMX3 abb′, respectively: 4-BAB4-Trx-5 (5′-CCGGAATTCCTACCCAGATACTCTGTGAGCA-3′), 112-TMX3trx2-5 (5′-CCGGAATTCCTACATAGCAAGGTAATTCTG-3′), and 113-TMX3lum Oh-5 (5′-CCGGAATTCCTATACTGTGCCATCCAAAATGTTAT-3′). The PCR products were inserted into the pRSET-miniT expression vector (21Zahn R. Buckle A.M. Perrett S. Johnson C.M. Corrales F.J. Golbik R. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15024-15029Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) using the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites to yield pRSET-miniT/TMX3a, pRSET-miniT/TMX3ab, and pRSET-miniT/TMX3abb′. These constructs were used to express domain constructs of TMX3 containing a 17-amino acid N-terminal affinity tag including six consecutive histidines and a thrombin cleavage site. After thrombin cleavage of the affinity tag, a GS dipeptide remains at the N terminus of the TMX3 domain constructs. The sequences of all generated plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Expression and Purification—Protein expression from pRSET-miniT-derived constructs was done as described previously for TMX3lum (19Haugstetter J. Blicher T. Ellgaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8371-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In brief, the Rosetta(DE3) Escherichia coli strain (Novagen) was transformed with expression plasmid and grown in LB medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol until an A600 of ∼0.75 was reached. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, and the culture was grown for an additional hour, before the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The 15N-labeled TMX3 a was expressed essentially in the same manner, with the exception that the transformed bacteria were grown in Celtone-N complete medium (Spectra Stable Isotopes) instead of LB medium for isotope labeling. The proteins were purified as described previously (19Haugstetter J. Blicher T. Ellgaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8371-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and the cleared supernatant was then applied onto a Ni2+-charged nitrilotriacetic acid metal affinity chromatography column (Qiagen), refolded while bound on the column by applying a linear gradient into an aqueous buffer, and eluted with a gradient of imidazol-containing aqueous buffer. Fractions containing TMX3 protein were pooled and cleaved with thrombin (Sigma). Finally, the protein was subjected to anion exchange chromatography using a SOURCE15Q column (GE Healthcare), and the purity was assessed by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels. Protein purification under nondenaturing conditions was done by resuspending the bacterial pellet in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) followed by cell rupture using a French press. After centrifugation for 45 min at 12,000 × g, the cleared supernatants were loaded directly on the affinity chromatography column. Further processing was the same as described above. Protein Concentration Determination—The concentration of the purified TMX3 proteins was determined from their absorbance at 280 nm by using the molar extinction coefficients calculated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (22Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5083) Google Scholar). An extinction coefficient of 45,920 m-1 cm m was used for TMX3lum and TMX3 abb′, 40,800 m-1 cm-1 for TMX3 ab, and 23,590 m-1 cm-1 for TMX3 a. Limited Proteolysis of TMX3lum—Limited proteolysis was carried out in 10 μm solution of TMX3lum that had been reduced with dithio-1,4-threitol (DTT) prior to dialysis into 100 mm KH2PO4/KOH (degassed and flushed with N2). The reactions were performed at pH 7.0 at 30 °C using the concentrations of trypsin (Sigma), proteinase K (Roche Applied Science), or subtilisin (Roche Applied Science) indicated in Fig. 1. The digests were stopped at various time points by adding PMSF to 10 mm. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with subsequent Coomassie staining or blotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. Alternatively, after treatment with PMSF, the samples were separated by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex S75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare). Fractions containing protein were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 0.02% (w/v) deoxycholate and overnight with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, the pellets were washed with 70% acetone and analyzed by mass spectrometry (FGCZ Analytical Services, Switzerland). Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography—Analytical size exclusion experiments were performed by applying 100 μl of protein sample in 50 mm KH2PO4/KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT on a Superdex S75 HR 10/30 column that was run at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The results were analyzed by plotting for a set of standard proteins using a low molecular weight gel filtration kit (GE Healthcare), the partition coefficient Kav, Kav=(Ve−V0)/(Vt−V0)(Eq. 1) where Ve is the elution volume, V0 is the void volume, and Vt is the column volume, against the logarithm of the molecular weight. A linear fit of Kav values for the standard proteins then served as a calibration curve to calculate the apparent molecular mass of the TMX3 domain constructs. CD Measurements—CD measurements were performed on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter in a cell of 1-mm pathlength at 25 °C. The spectra were averaged from 10 scans, and the buffer base line was subtracted. The TMX3 a domain was used at a concentration of 27 μm in a buffer containing 50 mm KH2PO4/KOH, pH 7.0. The protein was reduced or oxidized by dialyzing overnight against the same buffer containing 0.5 mm DTT or 0.1 mm GSSG, respectively. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were measured on a BRUKER DRX600 spectrometer at a proton resonance frequency of 600 MHz using an inverse triple resonance 1H,15N,13C probe equipped with an actively shielded z-gradient coil. The 5-mm NMR tubes were filled with 550 ml of a solution of reduced TMX3 a domain in 95% H2O, 5% D2O containing 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 8.0. Proton homonuclear one-dimensional spectra and two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra (23Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar) were recorded at a temperature of 20 °C. Using the same experimental conditions, a [1H,15N]-correlated two-dimensional spectrum (24Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980; 69: 185-189Crossref Scopus (2442) Google Scholar) was measured on a sample of 0.86 mm 15N-labeled TMX3 a domain. Protein Stability Measurements—Protein stability was measured at different concentrations of ultra pure urea (Sigma) in 100 mm KH2PO4/KOH, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and either 10 mm GSH or 2 mm GSSG using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer. Urea concentrations were determined with a refractometer. Prior to denaturation, the native protein was incubated at room temperature in the presence of 10 mm GSH or 2 mm GSSG for at least 1 h. After adding urea from a concentrated stock solution, the samples were again allowed to equilibrate for 1 h at room temperature, because pilot experiments had demonstrated complete denaturation within this time frame. To test the reversibility of denaturation, samples at the same concentration of urea were produced from native and fully denatured protein, respectively. Pairs of samples generated this way showed nearly identical fluorescence emission spectra. Fluorescence experiments were performed at 25 °C, with a scan rate of 300 nm/min and excitation and emission slits of 5 nm. After excitation at 280 nm, an emission scan was recorded between 300 and 400 nm. Each spectrum was corrected for background fluorescence. The final protein concentration was 0.2 μm. The unfolding profile of each TMX3 domain construct was determined in at least two independent experiments. The presented values were calculated from the experiments shown in Fig. 4.FIGURE 4Stability measurements of reduced and oxidized TMX3 fragments. A, far UV CD spectra of reduced (dashed line) and oxidized (solid line) TMX3 a. The protein was either reduced with 0.5 mm DTT or oxidized with 0.1 mm GSSG. B, 0.2 μm of TMX3 a (blue diamonds), TMX3 ab (red squares), or TMX3 abb′ (black circles), were reduced in the presence of 10 mm GSH (empty symbols) or oxidized in the presence of 2 mm GSSG (filled symbols) and subsequently denatured with urea. After excitation at 280 nm, fluorescence emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 400 nm. Each spectrum was background corrected, and the wavelength values at which maximal fluorescence emission was observed, λmax, were plotted in dependence of the urea concentration. The data points were fitted to a two-state model (TMX3 a) or a three-state model (TMX3 ab and TMX3 abb′) to obtain the midpoints of conversion x½. Note that the midpoints of denaturation, x′½, given in the text were calculated by introducing a corrective term to compensate for the nonlinear relationship between the λmax signal and the concentrations of native and denatured protein, which is why they are not exactly the same values that can be determined by visual inspection of the curves in this panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Data processing was performed as described by Monsellier and Bedouelle (25Monsellier E. Bedouelle H. Protein. Eng. Des. Sel. 2005; 18: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, each spectrum was approximated by a Taylor expansion between 320 and 380 nm to the following equation, Y(λ,x)≈a(x)+[(λ−λmax) 2/2!]b(x)+[(λ−λmax) 3/3!]c(x)(Eq. 2) where Y is the measured fluorescence intensity at the wavelength λ, λmax is the wavelength at which the intensity Y is maximal, x is the urea concentration, a(x) = Y(λmax, x), b(x) = (δ2Y/δλ2) (λmax, x), and c(x) = (δ3Y/δλ3) (λmax, x), with a, b, c, and λmax as floating parameters. In the next step, the maximal intensity λmax as a function of the urea concentration x was fitted either to a three-state modelλmax(X)=[λN+λIexp(-(ΔGNI-mNIX)/RT)+λUexp(-(ΔGNI-mNIX)/RTexp(-(ΔGIU-mIUX)/RT)]/(-(ΔGNI-mNIX)/RT+exp(-(ΔGNI-mNIX)/RT)exp(-(ΔGIU-mIUX]/RT or to a two-state model λmax(x)=[λN+λUexp(−(ΔGNU−mNUx)/RT)]/[1+exp(−(ΔGNU−mNUx)/RT)](Eq. 4) with the floating parameters λN, λI, and λU being the intensity maxima of fluorescence of the native, intermediate, and unfolded state, respectively; ΔGNI, ΔGIU, and ΔGNU are the free energies for the conversions extrapolated to x = 0; and mNI, mIU, and mNU are the values for the cooperativity of the respective conversions. The midpoint of conversion, x½, i.e. the concentration of urea at which λmax(x) reached half its maximal value, was calculated as follows. x1/2=ΔG/m(Eq. 5) Because the recorded value of λmax(x) is not a linear function of the molar fractions of the folded and unfolded states, x½ does not represent half-advancement of the unfolding reaction. Hence, the midpoint of denaturation, x′½, was calculated by introducing a corrective term as detailed in Ref. 25Monsellier E. Bedouelle H. Protein. Eng. Des. Sel. 2005; 18: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar. Peptide Oxidation Assay—The ability of TMX3 domain constructs to oxidize dithiols was investigated by following the fluorescence change upon oxidation of the decapeptide NRCSQGSCWN, as described earlier (19Haugstetter J. Blicher T. Ellgaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8371-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Data analysis was performed as detailed in Ref. 26Ruddock L.W. Hirst T.R. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar. Reaction Kinetics of TMX3 Domain Constructs with GSSG—Pseudo first order rate constants and apparent second order rate constants for the reaction between reduced TMX3 domain constructs and GSSG were determined by measuring the fluorescence change upon oxidation of the protein essentially as described in Ref. 27Hansen R.E. Ostergaard H. Winther J.R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar. Proteins used in this assay were reduced for 1 h at room temperature with 2 mm DTT before the reducing agent was removed on a Micro Bio-Spin 30 column (Bio-Rad), pre-equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (degassed and flushed with N2). Finally, protein samples were diluted to ∼0.25 μm in the same buffer. Fluorescence emission at 328 nm, upon excitation at 280 nm, was then monitored in a stirrable quartz cuvette that had been silanized to minimize adsorption to the glass surface, as observed in particular for the TMX3 a domain upon oxidation. After a stable base line was attained, the reaction was initiated by the addition of a molar excess of GSSG (final concentrations, 16-355 μm) from a concentrated stock solution. Pseudo first order rate constants were determined by fitting single exponential functions to the data points. In particular for TMX3 a, we observed a drop in the fluorescence signal when full oxidation was approached, most likely because of glass adsorption as mentioned above. In these cases, we only included data points for the fit corresponding to ∼90% completion of oxidation. An apparent second order rate constant was determined from a linear fit to a series of experiments with varying GSSG concentrations. Two sets of independent experiments were performed with similar results. Molecular Modeling—A working model of TMX3 abb′ was constructed with the program Modeller (28Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10690) Google Scholar) using default settings and the alignment shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The model comprises residues 25-340 and is based on the NMR solution structure of the PDI a domain (Protein Data Bank code 1MEK) (29Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E.

When constructing the model, an overlapping and similar region between the two templates was included in the alignment. This way the templates were aligned to preserve the relative domain orientation in calsequestrin. The quality of the model was assessed by submitting it to the ProQ server (www.sbc.su.se/~bjornw/ProQ/), which has been designed to evaluate protein homology models (31Wallner B. Elofsson A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1073-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The evaluation produced scores that were indicative of a reliable, high quality model (LGscore = 4.09, MaxSub = 0.48). Analysis of the backbone dihedral angles in the model using the MolProbity server (molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/) (32Davis I.W. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W615-W619Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) showed that 94% of the residues were in the most favored regions, and 99% were within allowed regions. Only three outliers (Leu68, Pro116, and Ser139) were marginally outside the allowed regions. Overall, this is comparable with the quality of the NMR template (PDI a). Determination of Domain Boundaries in the Luminal Region of TMX3—To analyze the domain composition of TMX3 and the relative stability of domains toward proteolysis, we subjected the recombinant full-length luminal region (TMX3lum; residues 25-373 (19Haugstetter J.

After digestion with subtilisin, proteinase K, or trypsin, digest mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane from which single bands were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. Alternatively, digest mixtures were separated by size exclusion chromatography and then analyzed by mass spectrometry. The fragments identified by these methods are listed in Table 1, where the numbering corresponds to the labeling of bands on the SDS-PAGE gel shown in Fig. 1B. A schematic overview of the fragments obtained with respect to their position in the TMX3 sequence is depicted in Fig. 1C.TABLE 1N-terminal sequences and mass spectrometric analysis of fragments from limited proteolysis of TMX3lumFragment numberProteaseN-terminal sequenceMassFragment identityDaTMX3lumUntreatedGSKG40,38525-3731SubtilisinGSKGFND25-?2SubtilisinND27,850ND3SubtilisinGSKG24,67625-2354SubtilisinGALI12,233131-2335Proteinase KGSKGND25-?6Proteinase KGSKG24,53225-2347Proteinase KAHRV12,780126-2328TrypsinGSKG38,40925-3559TrypsinGXK26,01625-24710TrypsinGSKG23,45525-22511TrypsinVSGA13,950129-247 Open table in a new tab The luminal region of TMX3 harbors an N-terminal thioredoxin-like domain that shows 38% sequence identity to the PDI a domain and contains a CGHC active site sequence (see Fig. 3B). This domain comprises residues 25-131 of TMX3 as indicated by sequence alignments with PDI, ERp57, and other ER oxidoreductases. Indeed, all three proteases cleaved TMX3lum close to residue 131 (fragments 4, 7, and 11). The remaining two thirds of TMX3lum are weakly similar to calsequestrin, a calcium-binding protein containing three redox-inactive thioredoxin-like domains. In TMX3lum, cleavage sites clustered in two areas in the C-terminal region: residues 225-235 (fragments 3, 4, 6, 7, and 10) and near residue 355 close to the C terminus (fragments 1, 5, and 8). In the case of subtilisin, the short C-terminal fragment was removed even at low concentrations of protease where smaller stable fragments were not yet generated (Fig. 1A), indicating it to be a highly accessible flexible tail. Overall, the results indicated that TMX3 contained three structural entities of about the same size. Secondary structure predictions (33Rost B. Yachdav G. Liu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W321-W326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar) were consistent with the presence of two thioredoxin-like domains in TMX3 in addition to the N-terminal redox-active domain (supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, the protease cleavage sites clustered in three distinct regions that correlated well with the expected positions of interdomain linkers and the sequence region between the most C-terminal domain and t"

Its expression is up-regulated by the G protein-coupled receptor from the Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (vGPCR). Although recent evidence shows that HO-1 contributes to vGPCR-induced tumorigenesis and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, the molecular steps that link vGPCR to HO-1 remain unknown. Here we show that vGPCR induces HO-1 expression and transformation through the Gα12/13 family of heterotrimeric G proteins and the small GTPase RhoA. Targeted small hairpin RNA knockdown expression of Gα12, Gα13, or RhoA and inhibition of RhoA activity impair vGPCR-induced transformation and ho-1 promoter activity. Knockdown expression of RhoA also reduces vGPCR-induced VEFG-A secretion and blocks tumor growth in a murine allograft tumor model. NIH-3T3 cells expressing constitutively activated Gα13 or RhoA implanted in nude mice develop tumors displaying spindle-shaped cells that express HO-1 and VEGF-A, similarly to vGPCR-derived tumors. RhoAQL-induced tumor growth is reduced 80% by small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown expression of HO-1 in the implanted cells. Likewise, inhibition of HO-1 activity by chronic administration of the HO-1 inhibitor tin protoporphyrin IX to mice reduces RhoAQL-induced tumor growth by 70%. Our study shows that vGPCR induces HO-1 expression through the Gα12/13/RhoA axes and shows for the first time a potential role for HO-1 as a therapeutic target in tumors where RhoA has oncogenic activity.

Heme oxygenase-1 is an inducible and ubiquitous 32-kDa enzyme that controls heme metabolism and iron levels by catalyzing the degradation of the heme group (iron protoporphyrin IX). The products of this enzymatic reaction are the physiological messenger molecule carbon monoxide, free iron, and biliverdin, the last being subsequently reduced to the antioxidant bilirubin (1Maines M.D. Gibbs P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The regulation of HO-1 activity depends primarily on the control of HO-1 expression at the transcriptional level (1Maines M.D. Gibbs P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A recent study shows that HO-1 expression is induced in endothelial cells infected by the angiogenic and oncogenic Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and that the enzyme is highly expressed in biopsy tissues from oral AIDS-Kaposi sarcoma lesions (15McAllister S.C.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the most frequent type of tumor in AIDS patients.

We have recently shown that vGPCR induces HO-1 mRNA and protein levels in fibroblasts and endothelial cells and that these increased levels correlate with increased cell proliferation and survival, as well as increased VEGF-A expression, one of the determinant events in KS development. Additionally, inhibition of HO-1 expression or activity critically impairs vGPCR-induced tumorigenesis in allograft tumor animal models (25Marinissen M.J. Tanos T. Bolos M. de Sagarra M.R. Coso O.A.

Despite the implication of HO-1 as a vGPCR downstream target, the nature of the molecular pathways connecting the receptor to HO-1 expression remains unknown. New studies show that vGPCR contributes to KS development by switching on a complex network of signaling pathways, including the direct or autocrine/paracrine activation and expression of receptors, cytokines, signaling molecules, and transcription factors (18Montaner S.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4525-4530PubMed Google Scholar). As other GPCRs, vGPCR activates downstream effectors by coupling to distinct α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (27Cannon M.L. Cesarman E.

Among these effectors are the monomeric or small G proteins of the Rho family represented by RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 (30Hall A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Indeed, Rac1 is activated by the receptor and mediates vGPCR-induced transformation in cells and tumorigenesis in animal models (28Dadke D. Fryer B.H. Golemis E.A. Field J.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5494-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the nature of the molecules connecting these receptors to HO-1 expression has not been established. In this study, we show that expression of constitutively activated Gα12 and Gα13 subunits mimicked vGPCR-induced HO-1 expression and transformation and that vGPCR activates HO-1 and transformation through both G α subunits. Our data indicate that vGPCR activates the small GTPase RhoA, a known downstream effector of Gα112/13, and that reduced expression or inhibition of RhoA impairs vGPCR-induced VEGF expression and secretion, cell survival and proliferation, and transformation both in cell culture and in a murine allograft tumor model. Moreover, Gα13- and RhoA-induced tumorigenesis are dramatically impaired when HO-1 expression or activity is inhibited. These data show that the Gα12/13/RhoA signal transduction pathway is an important mediator of vGPCR-induced tumor growth and demonstrate the participation of HO-1 in this process. These findings uncover a more extensive role of HO-1 in tumorigenesis and suggest that the enzyme can be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment not only of KS but also of tumors where RhoA is oncogenic.

Cuadrado A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11332-11346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Stable transfection of NIH-3T3 cells was performed using the calcium phosphate technique (40Marinissen M.J. Servitja J.M. Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46814-46825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 20% confluence in 10-cm plates and transfected with 10 μg of pCEFL (NIH-3T3c), pCEFL-HA-m2 (NIH-m2), pCEFL-HA-Gα13QL (NIH-Gα13QL), or pCEFL-AU5-RhoAQL (NIH-RhoAQL). Stably transfected cells were selected with 750 μg/ml G418 (Promega). NIH-m2 cells were further transfected with 5 μg of pCEFL-G13i5 (NIH-m2-G13i5) or pCEFL-Gqi5 (NIH-m2-Gqi5) along with 100 ng of pCEP4 to allow selection by hygromycin. NIH-RhoAQL cells were transfected with 5 μg of pSshRNAHO-1 (NIH-RhoAQLshHO-1) and 100 ng of pCEP4. NIH-vGPCR cells were transfected with 100 ng of pCEP4 and 5 μg of pSshRNARho1 or pSshRNARho2 (NIH-vGPCRshRho1, NIH-vGPCRshRho2). NIH-vGPCR cells were also stably transfected with 5 μg of pSshRNAGα13.1, pSshRNAGα13.2, pSshRNAGα12, or pSshRNAscramble (NIH-vGPCRshG13.1, NIH-vGPCRshG13.2, NIH-vGPCRshG12, or NIH-vGPCRshScram, respectively). Transfected cells were selected with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B from Streptomyces (Sigma). Gene-specific Real Time PCR—Total RNA from cells was extracted by homogenization in TRIzol (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were grown to 80% confluence, serum-starved for 24 h, washed with cold PBS, and lysed in TRIzol according to the manufacturer's indications. Equal amounts of RNA (1 μg) were reverse-transcribed to obtain cDNA with the Enhanced Avian First Strand Synthesis kit (Sigma). Real time PCR was performed using the ABI prism 7700 sequencer detector system and Qiagen's Quantitect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, the reaction mixture (50-μl total volume) contained 500 ng of cDNA, gene-specific forward and reverse primers for each gene at 1 mm final concentration, and 25 μl of Quantitect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix. The real time cycler conditions were as follows: PCR initial activation step at 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles each of melting at 95 °C for 15 s, and annealing/extension at 60 °C for 1 min. A negative control without template was included in parallel to assess the overall specificity of the reaction. The PCR products were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel to confirm the size of the amplified product. After PCR, a comparative delta cycle threshold method was used to determine the relative amounts of specific gene and actin mRNA. The sequences of the primers used were as follows: HO-1, 5′-CAACAGTGGCAGTGGGAATTT and 3′-CCAGGCAAGATTCTCCCTTAC; GAPDH, 5′-TCCATCACAACTTTGGCATTG and 3′-TCACGCACAAGCTTTCCA; β-actin 5′-AGTACTCCGTGTGGATCGGC and 3-AGGTCGTCTACACCTAGTCG. Analysis of mRNA Levels by Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA from cells was obtained by extraction in TRIzol (Invitrogen). Total RNA from tumors was obtained by homogenizing the tissue in TRIzol with a Teflon homogenizer followed by sonication. Equal amounts of RNA (1 μg) were reverse-transcribed to obtain cDNA with the Enhanced Avian First Strand Synthesis kit (Sigma). PCRs were performed using the Ready Mix RedTaq PCR reactive mix (Sigma). HO-1 oligonucleotides described above were used to amplify a 106-bp HO-1 fragment. A vGPCR fragment was amplified using the oligonucleotides 5′-GCGAATTCACCATGGCGGCCGAGGATTTCCTAAC and 3′-GCGCGGCCGCCTACGTGGTGGCGCCGGACATGA. The three splice variants of VEGF-A were amplified using 5′-CTGCTCTCTTGGGTGCACTGG and 3′-ACCGCCTTGGCTTGTCACAT primers (40Marinissen M.J. Servitja J.M. Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46814-46825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Expected product sizes were 431, 563, and 635 bp, corresponding to the VEGF120, VEGF164, and VEGF188 splice variant isoforms (35Goldhar A.S. Vonderhaar B.K. Trott J.F. Hovey R.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2005; 232: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A 982-bp DNA fragment from the coding sequence for AU5-RhoAQL was amplified by the oligonucleotides AU5 (5′-ATGGGATCCACCGACTTCTACC) and RhoA (3′-CTTCCCACGTCTAGCTTGCAGA). HA-Gα13QL was amplified using HA (5′-TACCCATATGACGTACCGGATTACGCA) and Gα13 (3′-GAGATTCTGTAAGGCGATTG). A fragment of 102 bp from the GAPDH housekeeping gene was amplified in parallel to all reactions to ensure that equal amounts of starting cDNA were used in each reaction. After an initial denaturalization step of 2 min at 94 °C, amplification of each cDNA was performed in 22-34 cycles (in increments of 2), to detect the linear amplification phase. Reactions were set at 28 cycles, which also allowed detection of basal HO-1 mRNA levels in control cells. The same amount of cycles was used for VEGF-A, AU5-RhoA, HA-Gα13, and GAPDH, using a thermal profile of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The PCR products were detected by electrophoresis in agarose gels and fluorescence under UV light upon ethidium bromide staining. Luciferase Reporter Assays—NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with different expression plasmids together with 0.1 μg of the indicated reporter plasmid and 100 ng of pRenilla-null (Promega Corp.) per well in 6-well plates. In all cases, the total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted with pcDNAIII-β-galactosidase or pCEFL-GFP. When indicated, cells were starved and treated for 24 h with 100 μm tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPP) (Frontier Scientific Europe Ltd.) dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH in PBS, pH 7.5. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities present in cellular lysates were assayed using the Dual Luciferase reporter system (Promega), and light emission was quantified using a BG1 Optocomp I, GEM Biomedical luminometer (Sparks, NV). Western Blot—Cells were lysed, and extracted proteins were resolved in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Endogenous HO-1 and transfected HA-HO-1 were detected by specific rabbit polyclonal anti-HO-1 (Stressgen Bioreagents) and mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (Covance). RhoA and AU5-RhoA were detected by anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-AU5 (Covance) antibodies, respectively. Gα12 and Gα13 were detected using Gα12 SC-20 and Gα13 A-13 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. As a loading control, α-actin was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma). Membranes were stripped with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce), following the manufacturer's indications. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences) using goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs coupled to horseradish peroxidase as the secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Focus-forming Assays—NIH-3T3 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique with 1 μg of each indicated expression plasmid as previously described (40Marinissen M.J.

The day after transfection, cells were washed three times with DMEM and kept in DMEM supplemented with 5% calf serum alone or with 100 μm SnPP for 2-3 weeks until foci were scored. Alternatively, 5 × 104 NIH-3T3c, NIH-vGPCR, NIH-RhoAQL, NIH-vGPCRshRho2, or NIH-RhoAQLshHO-1 cells were seeded on a 70% confluent monolayer of NIH-3T3 cells and cultured as above until foci were detected. Cells were fixed with methanol for 30 min, washed with water, dried, and stained with Giemsa (Sigma). Rho Activation Assay—Rho activity in cultured cells was assessed by a modified Rho binding domain assay as already described (43Fukuhara S. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, and after serum starvation for 24 h, cells were lysed at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EGTA, 40 mm glycero-phosphate, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were incubated with glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin-Rho binding domain previously bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and washed four times with lysis buffer. Associated GTP-bound forms of Rho were released with protein loading buffer and revealed by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Indirect Immunofluorescence—NIH-3T3 cells were seeded on glass coverslips and transfected with Lipofectamine Plus reagents (Invitrogen). Cells were serum-starved for 24 h, washed twice with 1× PBS, and then fixed and permeabilized with 4% formaldehyde and 0.05% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with anti HO-1 (Stressgen Bioreagents) or anti-AU5 antibodies (Covance) as primary antibodies for 1 h. Following incubation, cells were washed three times with 1× PBS and then incubated for an additional 1 h with the corresponding secondary antibodies (1:200) conjugated with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate and fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes). When indicated, cells were incubated with AlexaFluor 594 phalloidin (1:40) for 30 s (Invitrogen) to stain actin filaments. Cells were washed three times with 1× PBS and stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes) in the last wash. Coverslips were mounted in Fluorosafe mounting medium (Calbiochem) and viewed using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S photomicroscope equipped with epifluorescence. Immunohistochemistry—Tumor tissues were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS, transferred to 70% ethanol, and embedded in paraffin. Sections were deparaf-finized in SafeClear and hydrated through graded alcohols and distilled water. Antigens were retrieved by heat in 10 mm citrate buffer, and sections were incubated with the anti-HO-1 (Stressgen Bioreagents) and the anti-VEGF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies (1:500). Slides were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse antibody for 1 h and then"
https://openalex.org/W2075750747,"As an alternative approach toward the development of a cholera vaccine, the potential of peptide mimics of Vibrio cholerae lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to elicit cross-reactive immune responses against LPS was investigated. Two closely related protective monoclonal antibodies, S-20-4 and A-20-6, which are specific for Ogawa O-antigen (O-specific polysaccharide; O-SP) of V. cholerae O1, were used as the target antibodies (Abs) to pan phage display libraries under different elution conditions. Six phage clones identified from S-20-4 panning showed significant binding to both S-20-4 and A-20-6. Thus, it is likely that these phage-displayed peptides mimic an important conformational epitope of Ogawa antigens and are not simply functionally recognized by S-20-4. Each of the six phage clones that could bind to both monoclonal antibodies also competed with LPS for binding to S-20-4, suggesting that the peptides bind close to the paratope of the Ab. In order to predict how these peptide mimics interact with S-20-4 compared with its carbohydrate counterpart, one peptide mimic, 4P-8, which is one of the highest affinity binders and shares motifs with several other peptide mimics, was selected for further studies using computer modeling methods and site-directed mutagenesis. These studies suggest that 4P-8 is recognized as a hairpin structure that mimics some O-SP interactions with S-20-4 and also makes unique ligand interactions with S-20-4. In addition, 4P-8-KLH was able to elicit anti-LPS Abs in mice, but the immune response was not vibriocidal or protective. However, boosting with 4P-8-KLH after immunizing with LPS prolonged the LPS-reactive IgG and IgM Ab responses as well as vibriocidal titers and provided a much greater degree of protection than priming with LPS alone.

Cholera is a severe diarrheal disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which is prevalent in many developing countries. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 120,000 deaths occur from cholera worldwide each year. Although the establishment of clean water and food, adequate personal hygiene, and sanitation are the long term solutions for cholera control, in the short term, sufficient improvements in these areas are difficult to achieve in most cholera-endemic areas. Meanwhile, there is an urgent need for improved vaccines as an additional public health tool for cholera prevention (1World Health OrganizationWkly. Epidemiol. Rec. 2001; 76: 117-124PubMed Google Scholar). Since the affected population is very poor, development of an inexpensive vaccine is most desirable. Currently available vaccines for cholera are based on killed, whole cell, or live attenuated formulations. The killed, whole cell (WC and WCrBS) vaccines provide only partial short term protection. The live, attenuated strains, such as CVD 103-HgR, have greatly improved efficacy in North American volunteers but have not been proven efficacious in field trials (1World Health OrganizationWkly. Epidemiol. Rec. 2001; 76: 117-124PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hill D.R. Ford L. Lalloo D.G. Lancet. Infect. Dis. 2006; 6: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, field trials of the live attenuated strain Peru-15 have proven to be safe, immunogenic, and efficacious (3Qadri F. Chowdhury M.I. Faruque S.M. Salam M.A. Ahmed T. Begum Y.A. Saha A. Alam M.S. Zaman K. Seidlein L.V. Park E. Killeen K.P. Mekalanos J.J. Clemens J.D. Sack D.A. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 192: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). An approach that could serve as an alternative or be used to augment existing vaccines is to develop defined component formulations. One surface antigen to consider as a potential component of such a formulation is LPS 2The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin. 2The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin. or portions thereof. LPS is composed of lipid A, core polysaccharide, and O-SP. Although there are over 200 serogroups of V. cholerae that have been identified on the basis of O-SP, only O1 and O139 are known to cause major epidemics. V. cholerae O1 strains are divided into two biotypes, classical and El Tor. Each of these two biotypes is further divided into serotypes Ogawa, which has an O-methyl group at the 2-position in the nonreducing terminal perosamine unit of O-SP, and Inaba, which has a free hydroxyl at this position (4Chatterjee S.N. Chaudhuri K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1639: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). LPS is known to induce protective Abs in animal models, and an anti-LPS response exhibited as a vibriocidal Ab response is the best correlate to protection in individuals who have been vaccinated or otherwise exposed to V. cholerae infection (5Provenzano D. Kovac P. Wade W.F. Microbiol. Immunol. 2006; 50: 899-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although native LPS is immunogenic, it is highly toxic due to the lipid A component. Systemic LPS leads to inflammation, multiple organ failure, shock, and potentially death. The O-SP by itself is poorly immunogenic (6Chatterjee S.N. Chaudhuri K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1762: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, LPS can be detoxified, coupled to a protein carrier, and used as an immunogen to recruit T-cell help (7Gupta R.K. Szu S.C. Finkelstein R.A. Robbins J.B. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 3201-3208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gupta R.K. Taylor D.N. Bryla D.A. Robbins J.B. Szu S.C. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3095-3099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another approach to overcome the problems associated with administration of LPS is to couple synthetic O-SP to a protein carrier. Synthetic O-SP conjugated to BSA has been shown to elicit a protective immune response in mice (9Chernyak A. Kondo S. Wade T.K. Meeks M.D. Alzari P.M. Fournier J.M. Taylor R.K. Kovac P. Wade W.F. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 185: 950-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These results, as well as the availability of mAbs S-20-4 and A-20-6, which are protective Abs specific for V.cholerae Ogawa O-SP (10Wang J. Villeneuve S. Zhang J. Lei P. Miller C.E. Lafaye P.

Indeed, because of their ease of production and their intrinsic immunogenic properties, peptide mimotopes may have several advantages over incorporating complex carbohydrate haptens issued from bacterial cell cultures or low yielding syntheses. Phage display libraries are commonly used to identify peptide mimics of various surface carbohydrate structures of pathogenic bacteria (26Monzavi-Karbassi B. Cunto-Amesty G. Luo P. Kieber-Emmons T. Trends Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A phage display library in which random peptides are expressed on the surface of filamentous phage provides a source of structurally diverse mimics (27Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar). Panning and screening phage display libraries with mAbs has identified peptide mimics of surface carbohydrate structures of several pathogens and tumors that have also been used as immunogens to elicit cross-reactive carbohydrate-directed responses (11Phalipon A.

However, only a few peptide mimics of surface carbohydrate structures have been shown to induce a protective immune response (17Buchwald U.K. Lees A. Steinitz M. Pirofski L.A. Infect.

Peptides identified by panning phage display libraries using an mAb directed against a carbohydrate ligand can mimic the ligand in either a structural or functional manner with respect to Ab recognition. Structural mimicry, the goal of these experiments, is achieved if the peptide and carbohydrate ligands are bound by similar groups on the Ab or any other molecule that the ligands bind. Structural mimics are generally thought to have the best chance at eliciting a robust immune response that will be directed against the mimicked antigen. Structural mimicry has been observed in the complexes of a camel heavy-chain Ab against lysozyme, where parts of some residues of the Ab mimic parts of the sugar substrate of lysozyme (28Transue T.R. De Genst E. Ghahroudi M.A. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Proteins. 1998; 32: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and in the complex of porcine pancreatic α-amylase with its proteinaceous inhibitor, where several specific hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the carbohydrate substrate are mimicked by the inhibitor (29Bompard-Gilles C. Rousseau P. Rouge P. Payan F. Structure. 1996; 4: 1441-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, if the peptide and carbohydrate ligands are bound by different groups on the Ab, then the nature of the mimicry is functional. The crystal structure of the Fab fragment of the Ab specific for the cell surface O-SP of the pathogen Shigella flexneri serotype Y in complex with O-SP pentasaccharide (30Vyas N.K. Vyas M.N.

Vyas M.N. Chervenak M.C. Bundle D.R. Pinto B.M. Quiocho F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15023-15028Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, the mode of mimicry in this case is functional. It is not yet known whether this peptide mimic can elicit anti-LPS Abs. Although peptide mimics possess unquestionable advantages as immunogens, the success of this strategy depends on the ability of the peptides to mimic oligosaccharide epitopes. A better understanding of the molecular basis of peptide-carbohydrate mimicry could help the rational design of potent peptide mimotope-based vaccines or allow improvements to be engineered into existing peptide mimics. Such an understanding could also help to further determine whether structural mimicry is a prerequisite to elicit cross-reactive, carbohydrate-directed Abs or to elicit a protective immune response. In this study, we have identified six peptide mimics that show significant binding to an anti-O-SP mAb in addition to the selecting anti-O-SP mAb, suggesting that these peptides are potential structural mimics. Mutagenesis of selected residues of a peptide mimic was carried out to determine what residues are important in binding to the selecting Ab. Based on the previously determined crystal structure of the selecting Ab complexed with synthetic fragments of O-SP, computer modeling studies were focused on predicting how one selected peptide mimic interacts with the Ab compared with its carbohydrate counterpart. These findings were related to the experimentally determined efficacy of the Ab. Antibodies—Murine ascites fluid containing S-20-4 and A-20-6 mAbs were gifts from Dr. J. M. Fournier and Dr. Farida Nato (Pasteur Institute, France). S-20-4 mAb (IgG1) was purified using a T-gel column (Pierce) or A column (Millipore). A-20-6 mAb (IgG1) was purified using a protein A column. Purity of mAbs was determined by Coomassie stain of SDS-PAGE, and Ab was quantitated by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). S-20-4 and A-20-6 mAbs were further standardized by their ability to bind to Ogawa LPS, which was quantitated by ELISA. Screening Phage Display Libraries—Phage display libraries in which 12 (X12) or seven (X7) amino acid random peptides or seven amino acid random peptides constrained by two cysteine residues (CX7C) displayed on the minor coat protein (pIII) of M13 phage were purchased from New England Biolabs. Phage were incubated with the selection Ab in solution, followed by affinity capture of the Ab-phage complexes onto protein A/G-agarose beads as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose (catalog number 53132; Pierce) were blocked for 1 h with blocking buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3, 5 mg/ml BSA, pH 8.6) and washed with TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20). 1 μg of S-20-4 or A-20-6 and 2 × 1011 phage virions from a given phage display library were diluted with TBST to a final volume of 200 μl and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The phage-Ab mixture was then transferred to the washed resin, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and washed with TBST to remove the unbound phage. In some pannings, phage bound to resin were eluted with 1 ml of glycine HCl (pH 2.2) and rapidly neutralized with 150 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.1). Eluted phage were titered to determine the number of phage captured by the Ab-coated A/G-agarose beads and were amplified by infecting Escherichia coli strain ER2738 (F′proA+B+lacIq Δ(lacZ)M15 zzf::Tn10(TetR)/fhuA2 glnV Δ(lac-proAB) thi-1 Δ(hsdS-mcrB)5; New England Biolabs). In other pannings, phage bound to resin were (nonelution) directly added to a culture of E. coli strain ER2738 for amplification. Amplified phage were purified by precipitating the phage with polyethylene glycol/NaCl (20% polyethelene glycol, 2.5 m NaCl). Three or four rounds of panning were carried out until a large enrichment of phage was seen, indicated by a large increase in phage titer. After the large enrichment, phage plaques were randomly picked, and the gene III region was sequenced by automated dideoxyoligonucleotide sequencing as described below. DNA Sequencing of Phage Gene III Peptide Motif Regions—To determine the DNA sequence of the peptide displayed on the pIII protein, phage clones were expanded by propagating them in 2-ml cultures of logarithmically growing ER2738 for 4-5 h at 37 °C. To recover the phage, the bacteria were removed from the culture suspension by a brief centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 s). 1 ml of the culture supernatant was mixed with 400 μl of 20% polyethylene glycol, 2.5 m NaCl solution, and the mixture was centrifuged (10,000 × g) for 10 min. The pellet containing the phage was resuspended with 100 μl of iodide buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 4 m NaI) and 250 μl of absolute ethanol and centrifuged for 10 min. The phage DNA was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 30 μl of TE buffer. 100 μg of the phage DNA was subjected to dideoxyoligonucleotide termination reactions using a DNA sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and -96 sequencing primer (New England Biolabs). The sequence of the gene III region was obtained by running the above reaction products through an automated DNA sequencer from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Phage Binding Assays—ELISA was used to assess the binding of phage to mAbs. 96-well microtiter plates were coated with serial dilutions of S-20-4, A-20-6, or IgG1 isotype control Ab (Southern Biotech) in 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 8.6) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were blocked with blocking buffer containing 5 mg/ml BSA. Approximately 1010 purified phage particles in 100 μl of TBST were placed in each of the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were washed six times and incubated with 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 Ab diluted 1:3300 in TBST (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, followed by washing six times and the addition of 100 μl of the colorimetric substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) until color developed. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 3 m HCl, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Competitive Inhibition—For the phage/LPS competition assay, microtiter plates were coated with 0.05 μg/ml mAb S-20-4, as above. A constant amount of phage was added together with different concentrations of LPS. V. cholerae O1 Ogawa LPS was a gift from Dr. S. Kondo (Josai University) or isolated using an LPS purification kit from Intron Biotechnology. E. coli LPS was from Sigma. The bound phage were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 Ab. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Gene III Peptide Motif Region—Each mutation was created by inserting DNA with the desired mutation between the EagI and BglII sites of the vector M13KE (New England Biolabs). Briefly, PCR was carried out using 50 pmol of oligonucleotide containing a BglII site (CTTTGTAGATCTCTCAAAAATAGCTACC) and 50 pmol of a 70-90-nucleotide oligonucleotide containing an EagI site and the desired mutation with PfuTurbo Cx Hotstart DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using single-stranded phage DNA as the template. The resulting ∼2-kb fragment was digested with EagI and BglII (New England Biolabs) and purified with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) to remove the digested ends. M13KE replicative form DNA was also digested with EagI and BglII, and the resulting ∼5-kb vector fragment was gel-purified. 45 ng of the ∼2-kb insert was ligated with 20 ng of the ∼5-kb vector fragment at a 6:1 molar ratio. After electroporation into the bacterial strain ER2738, each mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing as above. Computational Docking of Peptide Ligand—Crystal structure of S-20-4/O-SP (32Villeneuve S. Souchon H. Riottot M.M. Mazie J.C. Lei P. Glaudemans C.P. Kovac P. Fournier J.M. Alzari P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8433-8438Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was manually examined for binding site geometry, hydrophobicity, electrostatics, amino acid side chain chemistry, and backbone and side chain mobility using interactive molecular graphics GRASP (33Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5314) Google Scholar) and PyMol (34DeLano W.L. DeLano PyMol. Delano Scientific LLC, S. San Francisco, CA2005Google Scholar) algorithms. Based on phage selection, Ab cross-reactivity, immunological data, and alanine scan binding data, peptide 4P-8 was used in all further ligand docking experiments. An initial peptide conformation for the 4P-8 sequence was obtained by using a BLAST search of the protein structure data base (available on the World Wide Web; search sequence, NHNYPPLSLLTF; data base = Protein Data Bank; expectation setting of 20,000 and PAM30 as the scoring matrix). No exact matches for the 12-mer probe sequence of 4P-8 were initially found. Thus, structural analogs of 4P-8 represented in the Protein Data Bank were identified by requiring sequences to contain the P-P covalent dimer and containing amino acids that, if not identical, were at least isosteres or similar in chemical nature to 4P-8 side chains (e.g. Gln for His or Met for Leu). A sequence was identified from Protein Data Bank structure 1RC6 (A. A. Fedorov, E. V. Fedorov, R. Thirumuruhan, U. A. Ramagopal, and S. C. Almo; Protein Data Bank code 1RC6) (112-119, PPGSLMTF, referred to here as 1rc6-P) as having sequence similarity to 4P-8 for the eight carboxyl-terminal amino acids. The 1rc6-P crystallographic conformation and bond geometries were checked using PROCHECK (36Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4363) Google Scholar), and all were found to lie within regions of normal protein geometry. The 4P-8 peptide sequence was threaded onto 1rc6-P in PyMol to make the 4P-8 sequence adopt a peptide conformation similar to a peptide reported for an x-ray-determined structure. The remaining four amino-terminal amino acids were idealized by requiring all-trans-peptide bond configurations. This structural motif and alternative peptide conformations, arrived at by the threading of the full 12-mer sequence (NHNYPPLSLLTF) onto similar peptides observed in similar Ab-peptide complexes (37Stanfield R.L. Ghiara J.B. Ollmann Saphire E. Profy A.T. Wilson I.A. Virology. 2003; 315: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), provided a range of similar hairpin peptide configurations. These hairpin structures were used in the manual docking of the 4P-8 sequences to the paratope of S-20-4. Peptide conformers were adjusted manually to bring all of the φ-ψ angles into the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran diagram while trying to maximize the peptide-Ab chemical complementarity (hydrophobic peptide side chains and charged side chains in close proximity to hydrophobic pockets and oppositely charged side chains of the Ab, respectively) and while trying to account for the apparent preferences identified in the alanine scan data. These manually fitted 4P-8 models were used to seed 105 conformations using distance geometry constraints in the program DGEOM. The constraints used to limit the search space included support for three intrapeptide hydrogen bonds, side-chain chemical complementarity in binding His-2 local to the heavy chain (h) Asp-33 and Leu-9 of 4P-8 or mutation L9F to a shallow hydrophobic patch in the O-SP binding region made by Ab residues h-Phe-50 and light chain (l) Thr-93 and Leu-10 of 4P-8 localized in the more size- and shape-restrictive pocket made by residues l-Tyr-34, l-Trp-93, and l-Trp-98 and h-Phe-50, h-His-99, h-Tyr-101, and h-Ala-102 (Table 2). In addition to Leu, the larger amino acids Phe and Ile were also used at position 9 for 4P-8 modeling. It was believed that Phe was a conservative choice for size tolerance for this position, as was indicated from binding data showing that peptides with Phe, Leu, or Ile in this position bound with approximately the same affinity. All resulting DGEOM-generated models were clustered and culled to representative individual structures with root mean square deviation values of 3-4 Å using the application COMPARE (a gift from Dr. Jeffrey Blaney). These conformations were further filtered via PROCHECK and PyMol and rejected when any steric clashes occurred with the Ab or when unrecoverable bond geometry was detected (via PyMol sculpture) (34DeLano W.L. DeLano PyMol. Delano Scientific LLC, S. San Francisco, CA2005Google Scholar). The types of peptide-Ab interactions and potential antigen mimicry for the best bound cluster representative of the 4P-8 peptide model was tabulated using the program HBPLUS (38McDonald I.K.

https://openalex.org/W1984595569,"The twin arginine translocation pathway exports folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane of many bacteria. In Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative bacteria, TatA, TatB, and TatC are all essential for efficient translocation, and current models suggest that separate TatABC and TatA complexes coalesce at the point of translocation. However, other microbes appear only to possess tatA and tatC genes. In Escherichia coli, virtually no translocation is observed when only TatA and TatC are present, but several mutations at the extreme N terminus of TatA were shown to support translocation. Here we show that these apparently bifunctional mutant TatA variants can function as typical TatA components because translocation is observed when they are co-expressed with TatBC, and they assemble into large, heterogeneous complexes that resemble wild type TatA complexes. However, cells expressing TatC plus the mutant TatA variants do not contain complexes that resemble the expected 370-kDa TatABC complex, clearly indicating that the mutant TatA forms cannot assemble efficiently, or stably, into this complex. The simultaneous expression of wild type TatA furthermore blocks translocation activity, suggesting that the mutant TatA forms preferentially bind to other TatA molecules rather than TatC. Surprisingly, we observe translocation in the absence of detectable free TatA, when translational fusions of the mutant TatAs with TatC are expressed. Transport can thus proceed in the simultaneous absence of TatABC and TatA complexes at detectable levels, and we conclude that the active translocon may be formed from dynamic twin arginine translocation complexes, one or more of which may await characterization.

In contrast to the general secretory (Sec) system where proteins are threaded through the membrane in an unfolded manner, Tat substrates are translocated in a fully folded state, in a process that is believed to require a transmembrane proton gradient (reviewed in (1Robinson C.

In E. coli, TatA and TatB exhibit 25% sequence homology, but they carry out distinct functions and cannot substitute for each other (11Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36073-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, it is often unclear from sequence analysis alone whether a given protein is a TatA or TatB homolog (12Yen M.R. Tseng Y.H. Nguyen E.H. Wu L.F. Saier Jr., M.H. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 177: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In such cases only functional characteristics can distinguish them as they have similar predicted structures, including a single transmembrane spanning α-helix with the N terminus located in the periplasm, followed by an amphipathic α-helix and a mainly unstructured C terminus (1Robinson C.

The third gene in the Tat operon, tatC encodes for a six-span protein that has both the N and C termini located in the cytoplasm (13Bogsch E.G. Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Robinson C.

The mechanism of translocation is still poorly understood, but purification and cross-linking studies have allowed the early stages to be hypothesized. Two complexes have been purified from the membranes of cells overexpressing the three essential Tat proteins. In E. coli a TatABC-containing complex was purified and shown to consist of TatB and TatC in equal amounts, with variable levels of TatA associated (15Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C.M.

The mass of this complex was estimated as 370 kDa using blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a technique which lessens the influence of detergent on size estimation (17Oates J. Barrett C.M. Barnett J.P. Byrne K.G. Bolhuis A. Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although some TatA was found complexed with TatB and TatC, the large majority is found in separate homo-oligomeric complexes (17Oates J. Barrett C.M. Barnett J.P. Byrne K.G. Bolhuis A. Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). More recently, the TatA complex has been studied in some detail using single-particle electron microscopy (18Gohlke U. Pullan L. McDevitt C.A. Porcelli I. de Leeuw E. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10482-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and a possible role in formation of the translocation pore was suggested. The TatABC complex is thought to be involved in the initial substrate-binding step, as cross-linking studies reveal that the signal peptide associates with TatB and TatC and this can occur with de-energized membranes where further translocation is prevented (19Alami M.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Cross-links between the signal peptide and TatA are not visualized until a proton motive force is applied across the membrane, suggesting that TatA complexes are recruited following signal peptide recognition to form an active translocon. Recent studies show the importance of specific residues of TatA for homo-oligomer formation (21Barrett C.M. Mangels D. Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Dabney-Smith C. Mori H. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5476-5483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and have led to the hypothesis that different amounts of TatA are recruited in relation to the pore size required for specific substrates to be translocated. TatC has been shown to be required for the recognition of the twin arginine motif of the signal peptide and TatA is involved in active translocon formation, but the precise role of TatB in E. coli has not been clearly identified. Most Gram-positive organisms contain only tatAC genes (12Yen M.R. Tseng Y.H. Nguyen E.H. Wu L.F. Saier Jr., M.H. Arch.

In support of this idea, Blaudeck et al. (25Blaudeck N. Kreutzenbeck P. Muller M. Sprenger G.A. Freudl R. J. Biol.

The mutations were located at the extreme N terminus of TatA. So far, the modified TatA molecules have been analyzed using a chimeric Tat substrate, and the export capabilities of these TatA/TatC mutant translocases have not been directly investigated at the protein level. Furthermore, it is not clear whether typical Tat complexes are formed. In the present study, we have characterized the Tat complexes in cells expressing these mutant TatA variants. We show that translocation can proceed in the absence of any of the previously identified Tat complexes.

The resulting fragments were digested with NcoI and PstI, and PstI and XbaI, respectively, and cloned in one step into pBAD24, generating pBAD-ACfus. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate constructs encoding the tat operon within pBAD-ABCs, pBAD-A+Cs, and pBAD-ACfus with point mutations in the tatA gene using the QuikChangeTM mutagenesis system (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutations are denoted M1/M2 for the TatA substitutions (25Blaudeck N. Kreutzenbeck P. Muller M. Sprenger G.A. Freudl R. J. Biol.

A vector encoding wild type or modified TatA with the fusion or separate copies of wild type or modified TatA and TatC were generated as follows. Wild type or modified tatA was amplified with the primers TatA NheI F and TatA NcoI R. The resulting fragments were digested with NcoI and cloned in one step into either pBAD-A+Cs, pBAD-Acfus, or pBAD-(A/M1/M2)Cfus, generating pBAD-(A/M1/M2)-A+Cs, pBAD-(A/M1/M2)-Acfus, or pBAD-A-(A/M1/M2)Cfus, respectively. All constructs generated were sequenced, and ΔABCDE cells were transformed. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Membranes were probed with antisera raised against TatA, TatB, or the Strep IITM tag (IBA, Göttingen, Germany). TatA and TatB were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody, and ECL™ reagents (Amersham Biosciences). TatC was detected (via the Strep II tag) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody and ECL reagents. TorA Activity Assay—Cells containing pBAD24-derived constructs were grown in LB-GT with 50 μm arabinose for 3.5 h. Cells containing pHSG575 derived constructs were grown in LB-GT with 1 mm IPTG for 3.5 h. Fractions were prepared, and TorA activity was determined as detailed previously (30Silvestro A. Pommier J.

Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis—ΔABCDE cells expressing pBAD-A+C or pBAD-ACfus were grown for 3.5 h in LB-GT in the presence of 50 μm arabinose, before being pelleted. Membranes were prepared and solubilized overnight in 2% (w/v) digitonin, 750 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, and 50 mm BisTris (pH 7.4 at 4 °C). Solubilized membranes were clarified by centrifugation (15 min at 250,000 × g) before being separated on a 5–13% acrylamide gradient gel. BN gels were performed as described (17Oates J. Barrett C.M.

An E. coli TatAC Minimal Translocase Exports an Authentic E. coli Tat Substrate—Previously, it has been shown that a combination of TatA and TatC can mediate translocation of a chimeric, cofactor-less substrate, TorA-MalE, in the absence of TatB if the extreme N terminus of TatA is modified (25Blaudeck N. Kreutzenbeck P. Muller M. Sprenger G.A. Freudl R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3426-3432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These mutant TatA subunits contain the sequences MSDIS (mutant M1) or MGDIS (mutant M2) in place of the MGGIS of the wild type. To analyze native E. coli Tat substrates, we tested whether these TatA + TatC constructs can translocate a large cofactor-containing protein, TMAO reductase (TorA). TorA folds and binds its molybdopterin cofactor in the cytoplasm, before being exported to the periplasm (33Ilbert M. Mejean V. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Samama J.P. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28787-28792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The TatA + TatC constructs were expressed in tat null mutant ΔABCDE cells, which were then fractionated, and active TorA was visualized by a native gel activity assay (30Silvestro A. Pommier J. Pascal M.C. Giordano G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 999: 206-216Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 34Barrett C.M. Robinson C. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2261-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that in the absence of Tat components (ΔABCDE) all of the TorA activity is localized in the cytoplasm as expected (lane C). When wild type TatABC is expressed (from plasmid pHSG-ABC) most of the TorA activity is located in the periplasm, confirming that the Tat system is active. The cytoplasmic form sometimes runs as a slower migrating band in these gels, for unknown reasons. As expected, when wild type TatA and TatC are expressed in the absence of TatB (Fig. 1A, lane A + C), no translocation of TorA to the periplasm is detected. In contrast, the modified versions of TatA (M1 and M2), are able to export TorA. These data demonstrate that only the TatC and modified TatA subunits are required to translocate a large native E. coli protein, and that the translocase formed must have the flexibility to accept differently sized substrates (MalE and TorA are 42 and 86 kDa, respectively). The assay is not quantitative, but it appears that the mutant TatA-TatC combinations support less efficient export than TatABC because a more prominent cytoplasmic TorA signal is usually observed. Although these constructs are able to translocate Tat substrates to the periplasm, they are derived from a low copy plasmid, pHSG575, which caused reduced levels of Tat components in the membrane (data not shown). Therefore, we cloned TatA and TatC into the arabinose-inducible vector pBAD24, which has been shown to express the tatABC operon at higher levels (>10-fold) compared with wild type TatABC levels (15Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20213-20219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A Strep II tag was fused to the C terminus of TatC during cloning to enable detection (the tag does not inhibit the function of the Tat translocase (15Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20213-20219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar)). In the figures, this tagged TatC is abbreviated to Cs; for example expression of TatA mutant M1 with Strep II-tagged TatC equates to (M1 + Cs), and expression of wild type TatA plus tagged TatC is denoted by (A + Cs). First, we analyzed the TatABC levels in cells expressing each of the different TatA mutants together with TatC, using antibodies specific to TatA, TatB, or the Strep II tag on TatC. The results are shown in Fig. 1B. In control samples, no Tat components are visualized in the membranes from ΔABCDE cells, although they are clearly detected when wild type TatABC is expressed from pBAD-ABCs. Expression of the three TatA + TatC constructs gives detectable levels of the TatA mutants in each case. Cells containing the new constructs were analyzed for the ability to export TorA to verify that the increased copy number was not affecting translocation activity, and the results are shown in Fig. 1C. The control tests gave the expected results; in cells containing pBAD-ABCs, most of the TorA activity was localized in the periplasm, whereas with ΔABCDE cells it is visualized in the cytoplasm. As demonstrated previously, TatA and TatC expressed alone are not capable of supporting translocation (A + Cs). However, the two mutant constructs, M1 + Cs and M2 + Cs, both exhibit significant transport activity. The Presence of TatB Does Not Disrupt the Translocation Activity Produced by TatC and Mutated TatA Subunits—The M1 and M2 mutated versions of TatA were expressed in the presence of TatB and TatC to ascertain whether they could still function solely as TatA. Constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using pBAD-ABCs as a template. First, the expression levels of TatABC were analyzed, and the results are shown in Fig. 2A. TatABC subunits were produced by all of the constructs tested, although no TatC signal is detected in the membranes of MC4100 cells because the wild type protein has no Strep tag. TorA export assays were used to assess the translocation activity of these mutants, and the results are shown in Fig. 2B. All of the mutants are able to translocate TorA into the periplasm, although the M1 and M2 mutations appear to result in a lowered export efficiency when compared with the pBAD-ABCs or MC4100 cells. It seems likely that TatB has a much higher affinity for TatC than do the M1 or M2 mutants, and the absence of a stable M1/M2-TatC complex supports this idea (see below). In turn, this suggests that the mutant TatAs are still able to function primarily (if not solely) as TatA subunits. However, we stress that we do not have data on the relative affinities of M1/M2/TatB for TatC under these circumstances, and further studies are required to characterize the TatC binding partner(s) in the translocons. The Mutated TatA Subunits Form Apparently Normal Heterogeneous TatA Complexes—Although the modified TatA subunits are able to compensate for an absence of TatB functionally, we wanted to address how the components were interacting with respect to the formation of Tat complexes in the membrane. A recent study (17Oates J. Barrett C.M. Barnett J.P. Byrne K.G. Bolhuis A. Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) showed the presence of two different Tat complexes when TatABC is expressed. A TatABC complex was shown to migrate as a discrete 370-kDa band in blue native gels, whereas TatA formed variously sized homooligomeric complexes that migrated over a range of 100–550 kDa. As these complexes are thought to assemble to form an active translocon in E. coli, we sought to determine whether expression of the mutated TatA + TatC complexes leads to the formation of similar complexes in the absence of TatB. Solubilized membranes were prepared from cells expressing TatC together with wild type TatA or the M1/M2 forms of TatA, and these were separated by blue native gel electrophoresis. The top panel of Fig. 3 shows an immunoblot with TatA antibodies, with typical ladders of TatA complexes visualized after expression of TatABC (pBAD-ABC lane). No bands are visible in the ΔABCDE sample, but the remaining lanes show the presence of apparently typical TatA patterns in membrane extracts of cells expressing the wild type and M1 or M2 forms of TatA with TatCs. The data obtained with cells expressing wild type TatA + TatC confirm that the presence of TatA ladders is independent of translocation activity, and the remaining data show that M1 and M2 form a typical range of TatA complexes. The Mutated TatAC Constructs Are Unable to Form a Discrete 370-kDa Substrate-binding Complex—The lower panel of Fig. 3 shows an immunoblot of the same BN gel using antibodies against the Strep II tag to visualize TatC-containing complexes. Previous studies (19Alami M. Luke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Muller M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 20Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) show that the TatB and TatC subunits initially bind incoming substrate molecules (19Alami M. Luke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Muller M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 20Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and we have assumed that the 370-kDa TatABC complex carries out this role. Surprisingly, however, no distinct TatC-containing bands were observed when either wild type TatA + TatC or any of the mutated TatA + TatC subunits were expressed under the same conditions. As immunoblots show that TatC is expressed at similar levels in cells expressing wild type TatABC, A + Cs, M1 + Cs, and M2 + Cs (see Fig. 1B), this suggests that either TatC cannot form the same 370-kDa complex with the M1/M2 variants of TatA or that any complex formed is highly unstable. A TatA-TatC Chimera Supports Tat-dependent Translocation—Although any TatABC-like complex is undetectable, a productive interaction between the M1/M2 mutants and TatC must be occurring, because the expression of wild type TatA or TatC alone is not sufficient for translocation function (13Bogsch E.G.

Van Den Brink-Van Der Laan E. De Kruijff B. Wallace B.A. Palmer T. Berks B.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13690-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We set out to test whether these two components could still support translocation when they were covalently linked by creating a translational fusion. A similar fusion of the E. coli TatB and TatC subunits is active (15Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20213-20219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and our rationale was that linking the mutated TatA variants with TatC may stabilize the complex. We expressed a translational fusion of the tatA and tatC genes, TatACfus, under the control of the arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter, with the C terminus of TatA separated from TatC by a spacer region of 10 asparagine residues and a factor Xa protease cleavage site (IEGR). Similar constructs containing the M1 and M2 mutations were also prepared. The TatACfus protein includes 372 residues and is predicted to span the membrane seven times with the N terminus located in the periplasm and the C terminus located in the cytoplasm. To examine the expression levels of the fusion proteins, membranes were prepared from ΔABCDE cells expressing the"
https://openalex.org/W1965774926,"Leukotrienes are implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse, inflammation-driven diseases. Metabolic inactivation of leukotriene signaling is an innate response to resolve inflammation, yet little is known of mechanisms regulating disposition of leukotrienes in peripheral tissues afflicted in common inflammatory diseases. We studied leukotriene hydroxylases (CYP4F gene products) in human skin, a common target of inflammation and adverse drug reactions. Epidermal keratinocytes express at least six CYP4F enzymes; the most highly expressed and highly regulated is CYP4F3A-the main neutrophil leukotriene hydroxylase. Differentiation-specific factors and retinoids are positive CYP4F regulators in vitro, effecting increased leukotriene B4 hydroxylation (inactivation). CYP4F expression is up-regulated in situ in hyperproliferative dermatoses-an innate mechanism to repair and restore epidermal barrier competency-and after retinoid therapy. Enhanced CYP4F-mediated inactivation of leukotriene signaling is a previously unrecognized antiinflammatory property of therapeutic retinoids mediated by preferential interactions between retinoid X receptors and CYP4F promoter elements in epidermal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1976752471,"The cytoplasmic N terminus of the Na,K-ATPase is a highly charged and flexible structure that comprises three predicted helical regions including H1 spanning residues 27 to 33 and H2 spanning residues 42 to 50. Previous deletion mutagenesis experiments showed that deletion of residues up to and including most of H2 shifts the E1/E2 conformational equilibrium toward E1. The present study describes a clustered charge-to-alanine mutagenesis approach designed to delineate specific sites within the N terminus that modulate the steady-state E1 ↔ E2 and E1P ↔ E2P poise. Criteria to assess shifts in poise include (i) sensitivity to inhibition by inorganic orthovanadate to assess overall poise; (ii) K+-sensitivity of Na-ATPase measured at micromolar ATP to assess changes in the E2(K) + ATP → E1·ATP + K+ rate; (iii) K′ATP for low-affinity ATP binding at the latter step; (iv) overall catalytic turnover, and (v) the E1P → E2P transition. The results of alanine replacements in H1 (31KKE) suggest that this site stabilizes E2P and to a lesser extent E2. In H2, residues within 47HRK have a role in stabilizing E2 but not E2P as revealed with double mutants 31KKE → AAA/47H → A and 31KKE → AAA/47HRK → AAA.

The Na,K-ATPase or sodium pump is essential for active transport of Na+ and K+ across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells and consequently for many key cellular functions including the maintenance of the membrane potential, cell volume, and secondary active transport systems. The Na,K-ATPase is an integral membrane protein complex consisting of a large catalytic α subunit (∼110 kDa) that spans the plasma membrane ten times and a smaller, highly glycosylated β subunit, which ensures the proper folding and anchoring of α at the cell surface. As a member of the family of P-type ATPases, during the course of its reaction cycle the α subunit of the Na,K-ATPase undergoes phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of a conserved aspartate residue within the large cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane segments 4 and 5 (L4/5). Both the dephosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of the enzyme undergo conformational transitions commonly referred to as E1 ↔ E2 and E1P ↔ E2P, respectively. At present, four isoforms of α and three isoforms of β have been described, which are distributed in a tissue- and -developmentally dependent manner (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 2Jorgensen P.L. Hakansson K.O. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev.

Analogous to the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) 2The abbreviations used are: SERCA, sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase; WT, wild-type. 2The abbreviations used are: SERCA, sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase; WT, wild-type. of known crystal structure (3Toyoshima C. Inesi G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 277: 35202-35292Google Scholar), conformational transitions of the Na,K-ATPase involve the interaction of the actuator (A) domain, comprising the cytoplasmic N terminus and the loop between transmembrane segments 2 and 3 (L2/3), with the loop between transmembrane segments 4 and 5 (L4/5) that encompasses the nucleotide binding (N) and phosphorylation (P) domains. (For a review of the nature of cytoplasmic domain interactions associated with conformational transitions, see Ref. 3Toyoshima C. Inesi G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 277: 35202-35292Google Scholar). Although both P-type pumps share a high degree of homology, there are several distinguishing characteristics between these pumps. (For a comprehensive structural comparison, see Ref. 4Sweadner K.J. Donnet C. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 685-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). One notable difference between the two P-type pumps is their cytoplasmic N terminus. In both, the extended link to the first transmembrane domain as well as the preceding two helical regions are fairly well conserved. However, the N terminus of Na,K-ATPase is ≈40 residues longer than that of SERCA and forms a highly charged and flexible region that includes an additional α-helix. Thus, in Na,K-ATPase there are three putative helices: H1 spanning at least residues 27 to 33; H2 spanning at least residues 42 to 50; and H3 near the S1 stalk region of the enzyme (5Segall L. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35202-35209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, not all of the N terminus of Na,K-ATPase is essential to pump function as portions can be removed or substituted with a tag protein sequence without abrogating pump activity (5Segall L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 35202-35209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we showed that deletion of 32 or 40 residues, corresponding to disruption or loss of H1, progressively shifts the E1 ↔ E2 poise of the enzyme toward E1 forms. Further removal of 46, 49, or 56 residues, corresponding to disruption or loss of H2, reverts this shift. The goal of the present study was to gain more definitive insight into the identity and role of residues or residue clusters involved in modulating conformational transitions. Based on the premise that intramolecular interactions via salt bridges underlie structural changes accompanying E1 ↔ E2 transitions (c.f. Ref. 2Jorgensen P.L. Hakansson K.O. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev.

pCDNA-rat α1 wild-type (WT) or mutant constructs using the Lipofectamine technique (Lipofectamine, Invitrogen), and cells expressing the relatively ouabain-resistant rat α1 enzyme and mutants thereof were selected as described previously (11Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells expressing the mutant α1 enzymes were amplified in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium plus 10% newborn calf serum, 100 units/mg penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μm ouabain as described previously (12Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane Preparation—NaI-treated microsomal-rich membranes were prepared from the WT and mutant cells by the method of Jewell and Lingrel (11Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described by Lane 13). Protein content was determined with a detergent-modified Lowry assay (14Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Tolbert N.E. Bieber L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Prior to assay, membranes were treated for 10 min at room temperature with SDS (0.65 mg/ml) in the presence of bovine serum albumin (1%) followed by dilution ≥5-fold with ice-cold 0.3% bovine serum albumin as described by Forbush (15Forbush B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Assays of ATP Hydrolysis—Na,K-ATPase activity was measured as the release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (16Munzer J.S. Daly S.E. Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16668-16676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly and unless indicated otherwise, the membranes were pre-incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with all reactants added except [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP and stopped with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid-1 solution (5% trichloroacetic acid, 5 mm ATP, and 2.5 mm NaH2PO4). Final concentrations for Na,K-ATPase activity measurements were 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 4 mm MgSO4, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA (pH 7.4), and 5 μm ouabain (Sigma). 5 mm ouabain was used to determine base-line hydrolysis activity. As in earlier studies, assays of Na,K-ATPase activity were carried out using 1 mm ATP to maintain close to saturating ATP concentration and also maximize sensitivity of assays of the relatively low-activity cultured cells (c.f.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Na-ATPase activity was measured at 1 μm ATP as described previously (12Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 20 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgSO4, 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA (pH 7.4), and 5 μm ouabain, with varying amounts of added KCl and choline chloride to maintain constant chloride (40 mm) concentration; base-line activity was determined with NaCl omitted and 40 mm KCl added. For studies of vanadate sensitivity, inorganic orthovanadate solutions were prepared fresh, in water, prior to the experiment and added with the [γ-32P]ATP solution to initiate the reaction. Na,K-ATPase activities obtained at various vanadate concentrations were analyzed by fitting the data to a one-compartment model using a nonlinear least square analysis of a general logistic function, as described elsewhere (19DeLean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Catalytic Turnover—Catalytic turnover was estimated as the ratio Vmax/EPmax, as described previously (5Segall L. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35202-35209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, for estimation of Vmax, one aliquot of SDS-solubilized membranes was taken for estimation of Na,K-ATPase activity at 1 mm ATP as described above. For measurement of EPmax, another aliquot was pretreated for 10 min at 37 °C with 20 μm ouabain and then for 2.5 min at room temperature with either 50 mm NaCl and 0.2 mg/ml oligomycin to block E1P → E2P or without oligomycin (vehicle alone) and with 50 mm KCl replacing NaCl (base-line values). Phosphorylation was carried out for 30 s at 0 °C with 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP as described earlier (5Segall L. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35202-35209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Rate of E1P → E2P—The enzyme was first phosphorylated by [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of high (600 mm) NaCl concentration to stabilize the enzyme in the E 321P state (20Klodos I. Post R.L. Forbush 3rd, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1734-1743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The E 321P → E 322P rate was then determined by measuring the rate of disappearance of total E32P following the simultaneous dilution of the salt concentration, reduction in [γ-32P]ATP specific activity (to allow “normal” relaxation of E 321P → E 322P), and addition of KCl to catalyze rapid hydrolysis of E 322P (20Klodos I. Post R.L. Forbush 3rd, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1734-1743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the enzyme was first phosphorylated for 30 s in medium containing 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 600 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Dephosphorylation was then initiated by 6-fold dilution with a “chase” solution containing final concentrations of 20 mm KCl, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Samples were taken for measurement of total E32P for periods up to 30 s. Background phosphoenzyme levels were obtained by allowing the chase to proceed for 60 s. Because the rate of K+-activated dephosphorylation of E2P is much faster than that of the preceding formation of E2P from E1P, the time course of E1P decay reflects primarily the E1P → E2P transition. To identify sites in the cytoplasmic N terminus of the α1-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase responsible for its modulatory role in conformational transitions, a series of charge-to-alanine mutants were generated. As shown in Fig. 1 and detailed in Table 1, alanine replacements of clusters of up to three charged amino acids between residues 24 and 56 that encompassed the first two predicted helical domains (H1, spanning at least residues 27-33; H2, spanning at least residues 42-50) were generated. (For details of N-terminal helical predictions see Ref. 5Segall L. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35202-35209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Following introduction of the alanine substitutions into the ouabain-resistant rat α1 cDNA and transfection into ouabain-sensitive HeLa cells, stable transfectants of control and mutant enzymes capable of sustaining HeLa cell growth in 1 μm ouabain were isolated. Average Vmax values for Na,K-ATPase of the membranes prepared from α1 control and mutant enzymes are given in Table 1. Changes in E1/E2 Poise Caused by Charge-to-Alanine Mutations—Results of the kinetic assays of the alanine mutants are summarized in Table 1 and Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5. Vanadate Sensitivity—A particularly discriminating measure of the E1/E2 poise is sensitivity of the overall Na,K-ATPase activity to inhibition by inorganic orthovanadate, a transition state analogue of inorganic phosphate that binds to E2 form(s) of the enzyme. I50(VAN) values for the control and mutant enzymes are shown in Table 1, and plots of those which differ significantly from the control are presented in Fig. 2. The most striking decrease in vanadate sensitivity is seen with 31KKE → AAA within H1; its I50(VAN) is ∼2000-fold higher than that of the WT enzyme. As might be expected, the I50(VAN) of 31KK → AA is similar to that of deletion mutant α1M32 reported earlier and also shown in Table 1; I50(VAN) values of both are ≈450-fold higher than WT α1. Increases in mutant I50(VAN) for the single charge-to-alanine replacements of residues 31KKE reflect the contributions of the individual charged residues, Lys31, Lys32, and Glu33, to the maintenance of the WT E1/E2 conformational poise. In H2, a modest increase in I50(VAN) was seen for mutant 48RK → AA. Little or no effects of alanine substitutions in other “single site” mutants were observed. K+Sensitivity of Na-ATPase and K′ATP—At micromolar ATP concentrations sufficient to saturate only the high-affinity phosphorylation site of the enzyme, the K+-sensitivity profile of Na-ATPase is, in general, a convenient and sensitive indication of mutant-specific changes in the E2(K) → E1·K+ → E1 + K+ pathway of the Na,K-ATPase reaction (for examples, see Refs. 12Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, as shown previously and summarized in Table 1, at 1 μm ATP, K+ inhibits Na-ATPase activity of the control rat α1 enzyme but stimulates up to ∼400%, the activity of deletion mutants α1M32 and α1M40, reflecting their increased rate of the normally rate-limiting K+ deocclusion step of the above reaction sequence (5Segall L. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35202-35209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 and also summarized in Table 1, charge-to-alanine mutations of residues in primarily two “sites”, 31KKE in H1 and 47HRK in H2, also resulted in K+ stimulation of Na-ATPase activity. In H1, all replacements (31KKE → AAA as well as replacements 31KK → AA, 31K → A, 32K → A, and 33E → A) resulted in K+ stimulations of similar magnitude, i.e. ranging from 147 ± 3% to 218 ± 26%. In H2, K+ stimulation is seen with mutants 48RK → AA and 47H → A. Although K+ activation is not seen with the triple mutant 47HRK → AAA, its K+-sensitivity profile indicates less K+ inhibition compared with the rat α1 control. K+ activation caused by replacement 24ERD → AAA upstream from the H1 helical region is absent in 24ER → AA, suggesting that Asp26, at least in the context of 24ERD, also has a role, albeit minor, in modulating the E2(K) → E1 transition. The notably greater K+ activation of Na-ATPase seen in earlier studies with the deletion mutants α1M32 and α1M40 probably reflects the combined removal of charged residues 24ERD and 31KK. Because the rate of K+ de-occlusion is increased almost two orders of magnitude by ATP binding with low affinity to E2(K) via the pathway ATP + E2(K) → ATP·E2(K) → ATP·E1·K → ATP·E1 + K+, it follows that a change in the E1/E2 poise affects the apparent K′ATP for low-affinity ATP binding and vice versa. The effects of the N-terminal mutations on K′ATP are summarized in Table 1, and plots of the data are presented in Fig. 4. There are several noteworthy observations vis à vis these data and the K+-sensitivity profiles described in Fig. 3. Thus, mutants 31KKE → AAA and 31KK → AA showed weaker K+ activation of Na-ATPase than either of the deletion mutants α1M32 or α1M40, yet both alanine-replacement mutants have lower K′ATP values than the deletion mutants. Similarly, K′ATP of mutant 24ERD → AAA, like that of deletion mutant α1M27, is lower than that of the WT α1 enzyme, whereas unlike α1M27, K+ stimulates Na-ATPase of 24ERD → AAA. These distinctions probably reflect the extent to which K+ de-occlusion proceeds through E2(K) → E1·K+ → E1 + K or through the low-affinity ATP binding pathway or is the consequence of a change in rate of the subsequent E1P → E2P conformational transition as discussed below. Thus, it is when these analyses are taken together with assessments of vanadate sensitivity and rate of E1P → E2P that they provide clearer insight into this issue (see “Discussion”). The Rate of E1P → E2P—Vanadate sensitivity reflects the relative abundance of E2 forms and thus reflects the rates of the E1P → E2P and E2(K) → E1 transitions. To gain insight into the reason for the large increase in I50(VAN) of 31KKE → AAA and 31KK → AA but only modest changes in K+-sensitivity of N"
