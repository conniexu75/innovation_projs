https://openalex.org/W3215572702,"Early detection of infectious diseases is crucial for reducing transmission and facilitating early intervention. In this study, we built a real-time smartwatch-based alerting system that detects aberrant physiological and activity signals (heart rates and steps) associated with the onset of early infection and implemented this system in a prospective study. In a cohort of 3,318 participants, of whom 84 were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), this system generated alerts for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in 67 (80%) of the infected individuals. Pre-symptomatic signals were observed at a median of 3 days before symptom onset. Examination of detailed survey responses provided by the participants revealed that other respiratory infections as well as events not associated with infection, such as stress, alcohol consumption and travel, could also trigger alerts, albeit at a much lower mean frequency (1.15 alert days per person compared to 3.42 alert days per person for coronavirus disease 2019 cases). Thus, analysis of smartwatch signals by an online detection algorithm provides advance warning of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a high percentage of cases. This study shows that a real-time alerting system can be used for early detection of infection and other stressors and employed on an open-source platform that is scalable to millions of users."
https://openalex.org/W3217269355,"Current methods for spatial transcriptomics are limited by low spatial resolution. Here we introduce a method that integrates spatial gene expression data with histological image data from the same tissue section to infer higher-resolution expression maps. Using a deep generative model, our method characterizes the transcriptome of micrometer-scale anatomical features and can predict spatial gene expression from histology images alone. The low resolution of spatial transcriptomics is substantially improved by including histology images."
https://openalex.org/W3217060248,"Abstract Reversibly photo-switchable proteins are essential for many super-resolution fluorescence microscopic and optoacoustic imaging methods. However, they have yet to be used as sensors that measure the distribution of specific analytes at the nanoscale or in the tissues of live animals. Here we constructed the prototype of a photo-switchable Ca 2+ sensor based on GCaMP5G that can be switched with 405/488-nm light and describe its molecular mechanisms at the structural level, including the importance of the interaction of the core barrel structure of the fluorescent protein with the Ca 2+ receptor moiety. We demonstrate super-resolution imaging of Ca 2+ concentration in cultured cells and optoacoustic Ca 2+ imaging in implanted tumor cells in mice under controlled Ca 2+ conditions. Finally, we show the generalizability of the concept by constructing examples of photo-switching maltose and dopamine sensors based on periplasmatic binding protein and G-protein-coupled receptor-based sensors."
https://openalex.org/W3217621440,"Metaheuristic optimization algorithms are one of the most effective methods for solving complex engineering problems. However, the performance of a metaheuristic algorithm is related to its exploration ability and exploitation ability. Therefore, to further improve the African vultures optimization algorithm (AVOA), a new metaheuristic algorithm, an improved African vultures optimization algorithm based on tent chaotic mapping and time-varying mechanism (TAVOA), is proposed. First, a tent chaotic map is introduced for population initialization. Second, the individual's historical optimal position is recorded and applied to individual location updating. Third, a time-varying mechanism is designed to balance the exploration ability and exploitation ability. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of TAVOA, TAVOA is tested on 23 basic benchmark functions, 28 CEC 2013 benchmark functions and 3 common real-world engineering design problems, and compared with AVOA and 5 other state-of-the-art metaheuristic optimization algorithms. According to the results of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with 5%, among the 23 basic benchmark functions, the performance of TAVOA has significantly better than that of AVOA on 13 functions. Among the 28 CEC 2013 benchmark functions, the performance of TAVOA on 9 functions is significantly better than AVOA, and on 17 functions is similar to AVOA. Besides, compared with the six metaheuristic optimization algorithms, TAVOA also shows good performance in real-world engineering design problems."

https://openalex.org/W3215383054,"Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) in bone induces bone-forming lesions that enhance PCa progression. How tumor-induced bone formation enhances PCa progression is not known. We have previously shown that PCa-induced bone originates from endothelial cells (ECs) that have undergone endothelial-to-osteoblast (EC-to-OSB) transition by tumor-secreted bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). Here, we show that EC-to-OSB transition leads to changes in the tumor microenvironment that increases the metastatic potential of PCa cells. We found that conditioned medium (CM) from EC-OSB hybrid cells increases the migration, invasion, and survival of PC3-mm2 and C4-2B4 PCa cells. Quantitative mass spectrometry (Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) identified Tenascin C (TNC) as one of the major proteins secreted from EC-OSB hybrid cells. TNC expression in tumor-induced OSBs was confirmed by immunohistochemistry of MDA PCa-118b xenograft and human bone metastasis specimens. Mechanistically, BMP4 increases TNC expression in EC-OSB cells through the Smad1-Notch/Hey1 pathway. How TNC promotes PCa metastasis was next interrogated by in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro studies showed that a TNC-neutralizing antibody inhibits EC-OSB-CM-mediated PCa cell migration and survival. TNC knockdown decreased, while the addition of recombinant TNC or TNC overexpression increased migration and anchorage-independent growth of PC3 or C4-2b cells. When injected orthotopically, PC3-mm2-shTNC clones decreased metastasis to bone, while C4-2b-TNC-overexpressing cells increased metastasis to lymph nodes. TNC enhances PCa cell migration through α5β1 integrin-mediated YAP/TAZ inhibition. These studies elucidate that tumor-induced stromal reprogramming generates TNC that enhances PCa metastasis and suggest that TNC may be a target for PCa therapy."

Interaction between host and microorganisms is important in nervous system development and nervous diseases such as Autism, Alzheimer, Parkinson and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Bacterial infections, as an environmental factor in MS pathogenesis play role in T helper 17(Th17) increase and it enhancing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interlukin-21(IL-21), IL-17 and IL -22. Oral microbiota consists diverse populations of cultivable and uncultivable bacterial species. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) is an acceptable method for identification of uncultivable bacteria. In this study, we compared the bacterial population diversity in the oral cavity between MS and healthy people.From October to March 2019, samples were taken at Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences' MS patients center. A total of 30 samples were taken from MS patients and another 30 samples were taken from healthy people. Phenotypic tests were used to identify bacteria after pure cultures were obtained. DNA was extracted from 1 mL of saliva, and PCR products produced with primers were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels.The genera Staphylococcus, Actinomyces, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Veillonella, Propionibacterium and uncultivable bacteria with accession number MW880919-25, JQ477416.1, KF074888.1 and several other un-culturable strains were significantly more abundant in the MS group while Lactobacillus and Peptostreptococcus were more prevalent in the normal healthy group according to logistic regression method.Oral micro-organisms may alleviate or exacerbate inflammatory condition which impact MS disease pathogenesis. It may be assumed that controlling oral infections may result in reduction of MS disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W3216305528,"The transition from a linear to a circular economy is urgently needed to mitigate environmental impacts and loss of biodiversity. Among the many potential solutions, the development of entirely natural-based materials derived from waste is promising. One such material is mycelium-bound composites obtained from the growth of fungi onto solid lignocellulosic substrates, which find applications such as insulating foams, textiles, packaging, etc. During growth, the fungus degrades and digests the substrate to create a web-like stiff network called mycelium. The development of the mycelium is influenced by several factors, including the substrate composition. As food waste accounts for nearly 44% of total municipal solid waste, incorporating food in the substrate composition could be a means to increase the nutrients absorbed by the fungus. In this paper, we study the effects of the addition of food supplements on the growth of two fungal species, Ganoderma lucidum and Pleurotus ostreatus. The substrates, the food supplements, and the mycelia are characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and optical microscopy. Our results show that addition of barley as a supplement significantly boosts the growth of G. lucidum and P. ostreatus. Using a common food as a nutritious enrichment for the development of mycelium is a simple and straightforward strategy to create waste-based mycelium-bound biocomposites for a large range of applications, on-site, therefore promoting a circular economy."
https://openalex.org/W3215510384,"Health varies by U.S. region of residence. Despite regional heterogeneity in the outbreak of COVID-19, regional differences in physical distancing behaviors over time are relatively unknown. This study examines regional variation in physical distancing trends during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigates variation by race and socioeconomic status (SES) within regions. Data from the 2015-2019 five-year American Community Survey were matched with anonymized location pings data from over 20 million mobile devices (SafeGraph, Inc.) at the Census block group level. We visually present trends in the stay-at-home proportion by Census region, race, and SES throughout 2020 and conduct regression analyses to examine these patterns. From March to December, the stay-at-home proportion was highest in the Northeast (0.25 in March to 0.35 in December) and lowest in the South (0.24 to 0.30). Across all regions, the stay-at-home proportion was higher in block groups with a higher percentage of Blacks, as Blacks disproportionately live in urban areas where stay-at-home rates were higher (0.009 [CI: 0.008, 0.009]). In the South, West, and Midwest, higher-SES block groups stayed home at the lowest rates pre-pandemic; however, this trend reversed throughout March before converging in the months following. In the Northeast, lower-SES block groups stayed home at comparable rates to higher-SES block groups during the height of the pandemic but diverged in the months following. Differences in physical distancing behaviors exist across U.S. regions, with a pronounced Southern and rural disadvantage. Results can be used to guide reopening and COVID-19 mitigation plans."
https://openalex.org/W3216988858,"Alteration of O-GlcNAcylation, a dynamic posttranslational modification, is associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Its role in chemotherapy response is poorly investigated. Standard treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), mainly targets Thymidylate Synthase (TS). TS O-GlcNAcylation was reported but not investigated yet. We hypothesize that O-GlcNAcylation interferes with 5-FU CRC sensitivity by regulating TS. In vivo, we observed that combined 5-FU with Thiamet-G (O-GlcNAcase (OGA) inhibitor) treatment had a synergistic inhibitory effect on grade and tumor progression. 5-FU decreased O-GlcNAcylation and, reciprocally, elevation of O-GlcNAcylation was associated with TS increase. In vitro in non-cancerous and cancerous colon cells, we showed that 5-FU impacts O-GlcNAcylation by decreasing O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) expression both at mRNA and protein levels. Reciprocally, OGT knockdown decreased 5-FU-induced cancer cell apoptosis by reducing TS protein level and activity. Mass spectrometry, mutagenesis and structural studies mapped O-GlcNAcylated sites on T251 and T306 residues and deciphered their role in TS proteasomal degradation. We reveal a crosstalk between O-GlcNAcylation and 5-FU metabolism in vitro and in vivo that converges to 5-FU CRC sensitization by stabilizing TS. Overall, our data propose that combining 5-FU-based chemotherapy with Thiamet-G could be a new way to enhance CRC response to 5-FU."
https://openalex.org/W3217119787,"As part of a screening programme for antibiotic-producing bacteria, a novel Actinomadura species was discovered from a soil sample collected in Santorini, Greece. Preliminary 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons highlighted Actinomadura macra as the most similar characterised species. However, whole-genome sequencing revealed an average nucleotide identity (ANI) value of 89% with A. macra, the highest among related species. Further phenotypic and chemotaxonomic analyses confirmed that the isolate represents a previously uncharacterised species in the genus Actinomadura, for which the name Actinomadura graeca sp. nov. is proposed (type strain 32-07T). The G+C content of A. graeca 32-07 is 72.36%. The cell wall contains DL-diaminopimelic acid, intracellular sugars are glucose, ribose and galactose, the predominant menaquinone is MK-9(H6), the major cellular lipid is phosphatidylinositol and fatty acids consist mainly of hexadecanoic acid. No mycolic acid was detected. Furthermore, A. graeca 32-07 has been confirmed as a novel producer of the non-ribosomal peptide antibiotic zelkovamycin and we report herein a provisional description of the unique biosynthetic gene cluster."

https://openalex.org/W3217806768,"The screening for undiagnosed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (SUNN) study was a population-based screening study that aimed to provide proof of concept to encourage community-level screening and detection for this non-communicable disease. Current screening guidelines do not recommend the routine screening of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) for asymptomatic populations, so providers are not encouraged to actively seek disease, even in high-risk patients. This study sought to determine whether a self-selecting cohort of asymptomatic individuals would have scores based on vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) significantly correlated to risk factors to suggest that routine screening for high-risk patients should be recommended. The study recruited 1,070 self-selected participants in Houston and Galveston County, Texas, 940 of which were included in final analysis. A pre-screening survey was used to determine eligibility. VCTE-based scores analyzed steatosis and fibrosis levels. Fifty-seven percent of the study population demonstrated steatosis without fibrosis, suggesting NAFLD, while 16% demonstrated both steatosis and fibrosis, suggesting NASH. Statistically significant risk factors included factors related to metabolic syndrome, race, and age, while statistically significant protective factors included consumption of certain foods and exercise. The findings of this study suggest that high-risk individuals should be screened for NAFLD even in the absence of symptoms and that community-based screenings are an effective tool, particularly in the absence of proactive guidelines for providers."
https://openalex.org/W3214803666,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may modulate more than 60% of human coding genes and act as negative regulators, whereas long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression on multiple levels by interacting with chromatin, functional proteins, and RNAs such as mRNAs and microRNAs. However, the crosstalk between HOTTIP lncRNA and miRNAs in leukemogenesis remains elusive. Using combined integrated analyses of global miRNA expression profiling and state-of-the-art genomic analyses of chromatin such as ChIRP-seq (HOTTIP binding in genomewide), ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq, we found that some miRNA genes are directly controlled by HOTTIP. Specifically, the HOX cluster miRNAs (miR-196a, miR-196b, miR-10a, and miR-10b), located cis and trans, were most dramatically regulated and significantly decreased in HOTTIP-/- AML cells. HOTTIP bound to the miR-196b promoter and HOTTIP deletion reduced chromatin accessibility and enrichment of active histone modifications at HOX cluster-associated miRNAs in AML cells, whereas reactivation of HOTTIP restored miR gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the CTCF-boundary-attenuated AML cells. Inactivation of HOTTIP or miR-196b promotes apoptosis by altering the chromatin signature at the FAS promoter and increasing FAS expression. Transplantation of miR-196b knockdown MOLM13 cells in NSG mice increased overall survival of mice compared to wild-type cells transplanted into mice. Thus, HOTTIP remodels the chromatin architecture around miRNAs to promote their transcription and consequently represses tumor suppressors and promotes leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3216330502,"Cook Inlet, Alaska, is home to an endangered and declining population of 279 belugas (Delphinapterus leucas). Recovery efforts highlight a paucity of basic ecological knowledge, impeding the correct assessment of threats and the development of recovery actions. In particular, information on diet and foraging habitat is very limited for this population. Passive acoustic monitoring has proven to be an efficient approach to monitor beluga distribution and seasonal occurrence. Identifying acoustic foraging behavior could help address the current gap in information on diet and foraging habitat. To address this conservation challenge, eight belugas from a comparative, healthy population in Bristol Bay, Alaska, were instrumented with a multi-sensor tag (DTAG), a satellite tag, and a stomach temperature transmitter in August 2014 and May 2016. DTAG deployments provided 129.6 hours of data including foraging and social behavioral states. A total of 68 echolocation click trains ending in terminal buzzes were identified during successful prey chasing and capture, as well as during social interactions. Of these, 37 click trains were successfully processed to measure inter-click intervals (ICI) and ICI trend in their buzzing section. Terminal buzzes with short ICI (minimum ICI <8.98 ms) and consistently decreasing ICI trend (ICI increment range <1.49 ms) were exclusively associated with feeding behavior. This dual metric was applied to acoustic data from one acoustic mooring within the Cook Inlet beluga critical habitat as an example of the application of detecting feeding in long-term passive acoustic monitoring data. This approach allowed description of the relationship between beluga presence, feeding occurrence, and the timing of spawning runs by different species of anadromous fish. Results reflected a clear preference for the Susitna River delta during eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus), Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), and coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) salmon spawning run periods, with increased feeding occurrence at the peak of the Chinook and pink salmon runs."
https://openalex.org/W3217542372,"The prion protein (PrP) is best known for its ability to cause fatal neurodegenerative diseases in humans and animals. Here, we revisited its molecular environment in the brain using a well-developed affinity-capture mass spectrometry workflow that offers robust relative quantitation. The analysis confirmed many previously reported interactions. It also pointed toward a profound enrichment of Na,K-ATPases (NKAs) in proximity to cellular PrP (PrP C ). Follow-on work validated the interaction, demonstrated partial co-localization of the ATP1A1 and PrP C , and revealed that cells exposed to cardiac glycoside (CG) inhibitors of NKAs exhibit correlated changes to the steady-state levels of both proteins. Moreover, the presence of PrP C was observed to promote the ion uptake activity of NKAs in a human co-culture paradigm of differentiated neurons and glia cells, and in mouse neuroblastoma cells. Consistent with this finding, changes in the expression of 5’-nucleotidase that manifest in wild-type cells in response to CG exposure can also be observed in untreated PrP C -deficient cells. Finally, the endoproteolytic cleavage of the glial fibrillary acidic protein, a hallmark of late-stage prion disease, can also be induced by CGs, raising the prospect that a loss of NKA activity may contribute to the pathobiology of prion diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3215270841,"Fragile X syndrome results from the loss of expression of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). FMRP and RNA helicase Moloney Leukemia virus 10 (MOV10) are important Argonaute (AGO) cofactors for miRNA-mediated translation regulation. We previously showed that MOV10 functionally associates with FMRP. Here we quantify the effect of reduced MOV10 and FMRP expression on dendritic morphology. Murine neurons with reduced MOV10 and FMRP phenocopied Dicer1 KO neurons which exhibit impaired dendritic maturation Hong J (2013), leading us to hypothesize that MOV10 and FMRP regulate DICER expression. In cells and tissues expressing reduced MOV10 or no FMRP, DICER expression was significantly reduced. Moreover, the Dicer1 mRNA is a Cross-Linking Immunoprecipitation (CLIP) target of FMRP Darnell JC (2011), MOV10 Skariah G (2017) and AGO2 Kenny PJ (2020). MOV10 and FMRP modulate expression of DICER1 mRNA through its 3’untranslated region (UTR) and introduction of a DICER1 transgene restores normal neurite outgrowth in the Mov10 KO neuroblastoma Neuro2A cell line and branching in MOV10 heterozygote neurons. Moreover, we observe a global reduction in AGO2-associated microRNAs isolated from Fmr1 KO brain. We conclude that the MOV10-FMRP-AGO2 complex regulates DICER expression, revealing a novel mechanism for regulation of miRNA production required for normal neuronal morphology."

The scientific community is not exempt from this universal problem and several studies have recently been caught manipulating or fabricating data. Current measures to prevent and deter scientific misconduct come in the form of the peer-review process and on-site clinical trial auditors. As recent advances in high-throughput omics technologies have moved biology into the realm of big-data, fraud detection methods must be updated for sophisticated computational fraud. In the financial sector, machine learning and digit-frequencies are successfully used to detect fraud. Drawing from these sources, we develop methods of fabrication detection in biomedical research and show that machine learning can be used to detect fraud in large-scale omic experiments. Using the gene copy-number data as input, machine learning models correctly predicted fraud with 58-100% accuracy. With digit frequency as input features, the models detected fraud with 82%-100% accuracy.

https://openalex.org/W3216399396,"Durian ( Durio zibethinus L.) is a major economic crop native to Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand. Accordingly, understanding durian fruit ripening is an important factor in its market worldwide, owing to the fact that it is a climacteric fruit with a strikingly limited shelf life. However, knowledge regarding the molecular regulation of durian fruit ripening is still limited. Herein, we focused on cytochrome P450, a large enzyme family that regulates many biosynthetic pathways of plant metabolites and phytohormones. Deep mining of the durian genome and transcriptome libraries led to the identification of all P450s that are potentially involved in durian fruit ripening. Gene expression validation by RT-qPCR showed a high correlation with the transcriptome libraries at five fruit ripening stages. In addition to aril-specific and ripening-associated expression patterns, putative P450s that are potentially involved in phytohormone metabolism were selected for further study. Accordingly, the expression of CYP72 , CYP83 , CYP88 , CYP94 , CYP707 , and CYP714 was significantly modulated by external treatment with ripening regulators, suggesting possible crosstalk between phytohormones during the regulation of fruit ripening. Interestingly, the expression levels of CYP88 , CYP94 , and CYP707 , which are possibly involved in gibberellin, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid biosynthesis, respectively, were significantly different between fast- and slow-post-harvest ripening cultivars, strongly implying important roles of these hormones in fruit ripening. Taken together, these phytohormone-associated P450s are potentially considered additional molecular regulators controlling ripening processes, besides ethylene and auxin, and are economically important biological traits."
https://openalex.org/W3216537654,"Aiming at these problems of image colorization algorithms based on deep learning, such as color bleeding and insufficient color, this paper converts the study of image colorization to the optimization of image semantic segmentation, and proposes a fully automatic image colorization model based on semantic segmentation technology. Firstly, we use the encoder as the local feature extraction network and use VGG-16 as the global feature extraction network. These two parts do not interfere with each other, but they share the low-level feature. Then, the first fusion module is constructed to merge local features and global features, and the fusion results are input into semantic segmentation network and color prediction network respectively. Finally, the color prediction network obtains the semantic segmentation information of the image through the second fusion module, and predicts the chrominance of the image based on it. Through several sets of experiments, it is proved that the performance of our model becomes stronger and stronger under the nourishment of the data. Even in some complex scenes, our model can predict reasonable colors and color correctly, and the output effect is very real and natural."
https://openalex.org/W3215318116,"Hypertension is becoming increasingly prevalent among the elderly. Family caregivers play an important role in caring for elderly people and empowering them to care for themselves. This study's goal was to see how social support training for family caregivers affected changes in hypertension, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and how such support led to the prevention of hypertension behaviors among the elderly in rural areas. This was a quasi-experimental study with 268 elderly people at risk of hypertension and their caregivers. Sixty seven pairs of elderly people and their caregivers were assigned to the intervention and control groups. Baseline data were collected in November 2020. The intervention group received the Social Support Family Caregiver Training Program (SSFCTP), while the control group received a regular program from the local health authority. The activity lasted 12 weeks, with home visits and telephone check-ups along the way, and data collection took place after the program ended. The final data were collected three months after the end of the intervention. An analysis of repeated measures ANOVA showed the overall effect of the SSFCTP on knowledge, self-efficacy, health care behaviors, and blood pressure among elderly people during three different time periods (p<0.05). Furthermore, the intervention program had a time-dependent effect on knowledge, blood pressure, and total cholesterol levels (p<0.05). In terms of caregiver outcomes, there was an overall difference among the degrees of knowledge, self-efficacy, and behaviors toward health care displayed by elderly hypertensive patients during the three different time periods (p<0.05). The average knowledge and self-efficacy of the participants improved after the intervention. As a result, better self-care behaviors and lower blood pressure and total cholesterol levels were observed among the elderly participants after the intervention. The programs emphasized the importance of caregivers' roles in providing social support, boosting confidence, and encouraging participation in caring, monitoring, and assisting the elderly in controlling blood pressure and other health issues."

The presence of disease related alterations in exhaled volatile organic compounds could therefore provide a basis for non-invasive biomarkers of hepatic disease. This study examined the feasibility of using global volatolomic profiles from breath analysis in combination with supervised machine learning to develop signature pattern-based biomarkers for cirrhosis. Breath samples were analyzed using thermal desorption-gas chromatography-field asymmetric ion mobility spectroscopy to generate breathomic profiles. A standardized collection protocol and analysis pipeline was used to collect samples from 35 persons with cirrhosis, 4 with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, and 11 healthy participants. Molecular features of interest were identified to determine their ability to classify cirrhosis or portal hypertension. A molecular feature score was derived that increased with the stage of cirrhosis and had an AUC of 0.78 for detection. Chromatographic breath profiles were utilized to generate machine learning-based classifiers. Algorithmic models could discriminate presence or stage of cirrhosis with a sensitivity of 88-92% and specificity of 75%. These results demonstrate the feasibility of volatolomic profiling to classify clinical phenotypes using global breath output. These studies will pave the way for the development of non-invasive biomarkers of liver disease based on volatolomic signatures found in breath."

https://openalex.org/W3216880793,"The size distribution of marine microplastics provides a fundamental data source for understanding the dispersal, break down, and biotic impacts of the microplastics in the ocean. The observed size distribution at the sea surface generally shows, from large to small sizes, a gradual increase followed by a rapid decrease. This decrease has led to the hypothesis that the smallest fragments are selectively removed by sinking or biological uptake. Here we propose a new model of size distribution, focusing on the fragmentation of marine plastics. The model is inspired by ideas from statistical mechanics. In this model, the original large plastic piece is broken into smaller pieces once by the application of ""energy"" or work by waves or other processes, under two assumptions, one that fragmentation into smaller pieces requires larger energy and the other that the occurrence probability of the ""energy"" exponentially decreases toward larger energy values. Our formula well reproduces observed size distributions over wide size ranges from micro- to mesoplastics. According to this model, the smallest fragments are fewer because large ""energy"" required to produce such small fragments occurs more rarely."

TG-goal, defined as ≤1,000 ± 100 mg/dL, was achieved in 95%. Among the 73 TG-goal achievers (responders), 53.4% reached TG-goal in <36 hours after CII initiation (rapid responders). When compared to slow responders taking≥36 hours, rapid responders had lower initial TG (2862.0 [1965.0, 4519.0] vs 4814.5 [3368.8, 6900.0] mg/dL), BMI (29.4 [25.9, 32.8] vs 31.9 [28.2, 38.3] kg/m2), DM prevalence (56.4 vs 94.1%), and reached TG-50% (half of respective initial TG) faster (12.0 [6.0, 17.0] vs 18.5 [13.0, 32.8] hours).

In multivariable analysis, predictors of faster TG response were absence of DM, lower BMI and initial TG.CII was effective in reaching TG-goal in 95% of patients with HTGP. Half achieved TG-goal within 36 hours. Presence of DM, higher BMI and initial TG slowed the time to reach TG-goal. These baseline parameters and rate of decline to TG-50% may be real-time indicators to initiate and adjust the CII for quicker response."
https://openalex.org/W3216746652,"Evidence-based teaching practices are associated with improved student academic performance. However, these practices encompass a wide range of activities and determining which type, intensity or duration of activity is effective at improving student exam performance has been elusive. To address this shortcoming, we used a previously validated classroom observation tool, Practical Observation Rubric to Assess Active Learning (PORTAAL) to measure the presence, intensity, and duration of evidence-based teaching practices in a retrospective study of upper and lower division biology courses. We determined the cognitive challenge of exams by categorizing all exam questions obtained from the courses using Bloom's Taxonomy of Cognitive Domains. We used structural equation modeling to correlate the PORTAAL practices with exam performance while controlling for cognitive challenge of exams, students' GPA at start of the term, and students' demographic factors. Small group activities, randomly calling on students or groups to answer questions, explaining alternative answers, and total time students were thinking, working with others or answering questions had positive correlations with exam performance. On exams at higher Bloom's levels, students explaining the reasoning underlying their answers, students working alone, and receiving positive feedback from the instructor also correlated with increased exam performance. Our study is the first to demonstrate a correlation between the intensity or duration of evidence-based PORTAAL practices and student exam performance while controlling for Bloom's level of exams, as well as looking more specifically at which practices correlate with performance on exams at low and high Bloom's levels. This level of detail will provide valuable insights for faculty as they prioritize changes to their teaching. As we found that multiple PORTAAL practices had a positive association with exam performance, it may be encouraging for instructors to realize that there are many ways to benefit students' learning by incorporating these evidence-based teaching practices."
https://openalex.org/W3216788491,"Stable isotope analyses, particularly of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N), are used to investigate ecological relationships among species. For marine predators, research has shown the main factors influencing their intra-specific and intra-individual isotopic variation are geographical movements and changes in the composition of diet over time. However, as the differences seen may be the result of changes in the prey items consumed, a change in feeding location or the combination of both, knowledge of the temporal and spatial consistency in the isotopic values of prey becomes crucial for making accurate inferences about predator diets. This study used an abundant marine predator, the Australasian gannet (Morus serrator), as prey sampler to investigate the annual variation in fish and squid prey isotope values over a four-year period (2012-2015) and the geographic variation between two sites with contrasting oceanographic conditions. Significant inter-annual variation was observed in δ13C and/or δ15N values of five of the eight prey species analysed. The strongest inter-annual variation in both δ13C and δ15N values occurred in 2015, which coincided with a strong El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This may suggest a temporal fluctuation in the geographic source of prey or the origin of their nutrients. These results suggest that it is important to consider the potential significant differences in isotopic values within the prey assemblages that predators consume. This is important to improve the interpretation of marine predator isotope results when determining the influence of environmental variability on their diets."
https://openalex.org/W3217192275,"When successful, the operation of local and international networks of crop seed distribution or ""seed systems"" ensures farmer access to seed and impacts rural livelihoods and food security. Farmers are both consumers and producers in seed systems and benefit from access to global markets. However, phytosanitary measures and seed purity tests are also needed to maintain seed quality and prevent the spread of costly weeds, pests and diseases, in some countries regulatory controls have been in place since the 1800s. Nevertheless, seed contaminants are internationally implicated in between 7% and 37% of the invasive plant species and many of the agricultural pests and diseases. We assess biosecurity risk across international seed trade networks of forage crops using models of contaminant spread that integrate network connectivity and trade volume. To stochastically model hypothetical contaminants through global seed trade networks, realistic dispersal probabilities were estimated from quarantine weed seed detections and incursions from border security interception data in New Zealand. For our test case we use contaminants linked to the global trade of ryegrass and clover seed. Between 2014 and 2018 only four quarantine weed species (222 species and several genera are on the quarantine schedule) warranting risk mitigation were detected at the border. Quarantine weeds were rare considering that average import volumes were over 190 tonnes for ryegrass and clover, but 105 unregulated contaminant species were allowed in. Ryegrass and clover seed imports each led to one post-border weed incursion response over 20 years. Trade reports revealed complex global seed trade networks spanning >134 (ryegrass) and >110 (clover) countries. Simulations showed contaminants could disperse to as many as 50 (clover) or 80 (ryegrass) countries within 10 time-steps. Risk assessed via network models differed 18% (ryegrass) or 48% (clover) of the time compared to risk assessed on trade volumes. We conclude that biosecurity risk is driven by network position, the number of trading connections and trade volume. Risk mitigation measures could involve the use of more comprehensive lists of regulated species, comprehensive inspection protocols, or the addition of field surveillance at farms where seed is planted."
https://openalex.org/W3217439190,"Similar to psychostimulants, the peripheral administration of menthol promotes mouse motor activity, and the neurotransmitter dopamine has been suggested to be involved in this effect. The present study aimed to elucidate the effects of l-menthol on parts of the central nervous system that are involved in motor effects. The subcutaneous administration of l-menthol significantly increased the number of c-Fos-like immunoreactive nuclei in the dorsal striatum of the mice, and motor activity was promoted. It also increased the extracellular dopamine level in the dorsal striatum of the mice. These observations indicated that after subcutaneous administration, l-menthol enhances dopamine-mediated neurotransmission, and activates neuronal activity in the dorsal striatum, thereby promoting motor activity in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3217635984,"To examine the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and successful aging among community-dwelling older adults.Adults aged ≥ 65 years who participated in the senior health checkup program at National Taiwan University Hospital during 2011-2013 were recruited (N = 467 at baseline). The participants were followed after 4 years and 6 years. MetS was assessed at baseline. Successful aging was evaluated at baseline, 4-year follow-up, and 6-year follow-up. We adopted an extended definition of successful aging, which was defined as three major domains: physiological, psychological, and sociological and economic domains. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess the association between MetS and successful aging adjusting for time (follow-up years), age, sex, years of education, alcohol consumption and MetS×time interaction term.The mean age of the study population was 72.9 (SD 5.5) years. The absence of baseline MetS had a positive effect on the probability of successful aging over six years. The absences of abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hypertension were associated with the physiological successful aging. The absence of hypertension was the most significant predictor of physiological successful aging [aOR (95% CI) = 2.76 (1.67-4.58), p<0.001]. Significant increased trend was found in the overall and physiological successful aging across MetS status (No MetS, pre MetS, MetS; Ptrend <0.001).We found that MetS is a risk factor of successful aging among community-dwelling older adults. Public health policy should aim at avoidance of MetS in order to facilitate successful aging in older population."
https://openalex.org/W3138854290,"Although myriad protein-protein interactions in nature use polyvalent binding, in which multiple ligands on one entity bind to multiple receptors on another, to date an affinity advantage of polyvalent binding has been demonstrated experimentally only in cases where the target receptor molecules are clustered prior to complex formation. Here, we demonstrate cooperativity in binding affinity (i.e., avidity) for a protein complex in which an engineered dimer of the amyloid precursor protein inhibitor (APPI), possessing two fully functional inhibitory loops, interacts with mesotrypsin, a soluble monomeric protein that does not self-associate or cluster spontaneously. We found that each inhibitory loop of the purified APPI homodimer was over three-fold more potent than the corresponding loop in the monovalent APPI inhibitor. This observation is consistent with a suggested mechanism whereby the two APPI loops in the homodimer simultaneously and reversibly bind two corresponding mesotrypsin monomers to mediate mesotrypsin dimerization. We propose a simple model for such dimerization that quantitatively explains the observed cooperativity in binding affinity. Binding cooperativity in this system reveals that the valency of ligands may affect avidity in protein-protein interactions including those of targets that are not surface-anchored and do not self-associate spontaneously. In this scenario, avidity may be explained by the enhanced concentration of ligand binding sites in proximity to the monomeric target, which may favor rebinding of the multiple ligand binding sites with the receptor molecules upon dissociation of the protein complex."
https://openalex.org/W3214913918,"There is growing recognition of the burden of depression in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), associated with negative behavioural and clinical outcomes. Unfortunately, most HIV care providers in sub-Saharan Africa do not routinely provide mental health services to address this problem. This article describes the process of developing a model for integrating the management of depression in HIV care in Uganda. Theory of Change (ToC) methodology was used to guide the process of developing the model. Three successive ToC workshops were held with a multi-disciplinary group of 38 stakeholders within Wakiso district, in the Central region of Uganda. The first 2 workshops were for generating practical ideas for a feasible and acceptable model of integrating the management of depression in HIV care at all levels of care within the district healthcare system; while the third and final workshop was for consensus building. Following meaningful brainstorming and discussions, the stakeholders suggested improved mental wellbeing among PLWHA as the ultimate outcome of the program. This would be preceded by short-term and intermediate outcomes including reduced morbidity among persons with HIV attributable to depression, allocation of more resources towards management of depression, increased help-seeking among depressed PLWHA and more health workers detecting and managing depression. These would be achieved following several interventions undertaken at all levels of care. The participants further identified some indicators of successful implementation such as emphasis of depression management in the district healthcare plans, increased demand for anti-depressants etc; as well as various assumptions underlying the intervention. All these were graphically aligned in a causal pathway, leading to a ToC map, contextualizing and summarizing the intervention model. The ToC was a valuable methodology that brought together stakeholders to identify key strategies for development of a comprehensible contextualized intervention model for managing depression within HIV care in Uganda; allowing greater stakeholder engagement and buy-in."
https://openalex.org/W3215313738,"The molecular mechanisms underlying morphological diversity in retinal cell types are poorly understood. We have previously reported that several members of the Copine family of Ca-dependent membrane adaptors are expressed in Retinal Ganglion Cells and transcriptionally regulated by Brn3 transcription factors. Several Copines are enriched in the retina and their over-expression leads to morphological changes -formation of elongated processes-, reminiscent of neurites, in HEK293 cells. However, the role of Copines in the retina is largely unknown. We now investigate Cpne4, a Copine whose expression is restricted to Retinal Ganglion Cells. Over-expression of Cpne4 in RGCs in vivo led to formation of large varicosities on the dendrites but did not otherwise visibly affect dendrite or axon formation. Protein interactions studies using yeast two hybrid analysis from whole retina cDNA revealed two Cpne4 interacting proteins-Host Cell Factor 1 and Morn2. Mass Spectrometry analysis of retina lysate pulled down using Cpne4 or its vonWillebrand A domain showed 207 interacting proteins. A Gene Ontology analysis of the discovered proteins suggests that Cpne4 is involved in several metabolic and signaling pathways in the retina."
https://openalex.org/W3216035470,"A variety of mitigation strategies have been employed against the Covid-19 pandemic. Social distancing is still one of the main methods to reduce spread, but it entails a high toll on personal freedom and economic life. Alternative mitigation strategies that do not come with the same problems but are effective at preventing disease spread are therefore needed. Repetitive mass-testing using PCR assays for viral RNA has been suggested, but as a stand-alone strategy this would be prohibitively resource intensive. Here, we suggest a strategy that aims at targeting the limited resources available for viral RNA testing to subgroups that are more likely than the average population to yield a positive test result. Importantly, these pre-selected subgroups include symptom-free people. By testing everyone in these subgroups, in addition to symptomatic cases, large fractions of pre- and asymptomatic people can be identified, which is only possible by testing-based mitigation. We call this strategy smart testing (ST). In principle, pre-selected subgroups can be found in different ways, but for the purpose of this study we analyze a pre-selection procedure based on cheap and fast virus antigen tests. We quantify the potential reduction of the epidemic reproduction number by such a two-stage ST strategy. In addition to a scenario where such a strategy is available to the whole population, we analyze local applications, e.g. in a country, company, or school, where the tested subgroups are also in exchange with the untested population. Our results suggest that a two-stage ST strategy can be effective to curb pandemic spread, at costs that are clearly outweighed by the economic benefit. It is technically and logistically feasible to employ such a strategy, and our model predicts that it is even effective when applied only within local groups. We therefore recommend adding two-stage ST to the portfolio of available mitigation strategies, which allow easing social distancing measures without compromising public health."
https://openalex.org/W3216172650,"Understanding why alien plant species are incorporated into the medicinal flora in several local communities is central to invasion biology and ethnobiology. Theories suggest that alien plants are incorporated in local pharmacopoeias because they are more versatile or contribute unique secondary chemistry which make them less therapeutically redundant, or simply because they are locally more abundant than native species. However, a lack of a comprehensive test of these hypotheses limits our understanding of the dynamics of plants knowledge, use and potential implications for invasion. Here, we tested the predictions of several of these hypotheses using a unique dataset on the woody medicinal flora of southern Africa. We found that the size of a plant family predicts the number of medicinal plants in that family, a support for the non-random hypothesis of medicinal plant selection. However, we found no support for the diversification hypothesis: i) both alien and native plants were used in the treatment of similar diseases; ii) significantly more native species than alien contribute to disease treatments particularly of parasitic infections and obstetric-gynecological diseases, and iii) alien and native species share similar therapeutic redundancy. However, we found support for the versatility hypothesis, i.e., alien plants were more versatile than natives. These findings imply that, although alien plant species are not therapeutically unique, they do provide more uses than native plants (versatility), thus suggesting that they may not have been introduced primarily for therapeutic reasons. We call for similar studies to be carried out on alien herbaceous plants for a broader understanding of the integration of alien plants into the pharmacopoeias of the receiving communities."

Physical and chemical stabilities were evaluated over a period of 90 days at 25°C. Analytical challenges were overcome with the development of a new extraction procedure based on solid phase extraction to ensure efficient clonidine hydrochloride quantification. The absence of physical instabilities, evaluated by qualitative and quantitative measurements (static multiple light scattering), as well as the absence of chemical instabilities, evidenced by a stability-indicating HPLC-UV method, confirmed that a beyond-use date of 90 days was appropriate for these compounded oral liquids."
https://openalex.org/W3216743179,"The Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias (HSP) are a group of genetic diseases that lead to slow deterioration of locomotion. Clinical scales seem to have low sensitivity in detecting disease progression, making the search for additional biomarkers a paramount task. This study aims to evaluate the role of evoked potentials (EPs) as disease biomarkers of HSPs.A single center cross-sectional case-control study was performed, in which 18 individuals with genetic diagnosis of HSP and 21 healthy controls were evaluated. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) obtained with transcranial magnetic stimulation and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) were performed in lower (LL) and upper limbs (UL).Central motor conduction time in lower limbs (CMCT-LL) was prolonged in HSP subjects, with marked reductions in MEP-LL amplitudes when compared to the control group (p<0.001 for both comparisons). CMCT-UL was 3.59ms (95% CI: 0.73 to 6.46; p = 0.015) prolonged and MEP-UL amplitudes were reduced (p = 0.008) in the HSP group. SSEP-LL latencies were prolonged in HSP subjects when compared to controls (p<0.001), with no statistically significant differences for upper limbs (p = 0.147). SSEP-UL and SSEP-LL latencies presented moderate to strong correlations with age at onset (Rho = 0.613, p = 0.012) and disease duration (Rho = 0.835, p<0.001), respectively. Similar results were obtained for the SPG4 subgroups of patients.Motor and somatosensory evoked potentials can adequately differentiate HSP individuals from controls. MEP were severely affected in HSP subjects and SSEP-LL latencies were prolonged, with longer latencies being related to more severe disease. Future longitudinal studies should address if SSEP is a sensitive disease progression biomarker for HSP."
https://openalex.org/W3215396446,"Objective Availability of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 is critical for controlling the pandemic, but herd immunity can only be achieved with high vaccination coverage. The present research examined psychological factors associated with intentions to receive COVID-19 vaccination and whether reluctance towards novel pandemic vaccines are similar to vaccine hesitancy captured by a hypothetical measure used in previous research. Method Study 1 was administered to undergraduate students when COVID-19 was spreading exponentially (February-April 2020). Study 2 was conducted with online panel workers toward the end of the first U.S. wave (July 2020) as a pre-registered replication and extension of Study 1. In both studies, participants (total N = 1,022) rated their willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccination and to vaccinate a hypothetical child for a fictitious disease, and then responded to various psychological measures. Results In both studies, vaccination intentions were positively associated with past flu vaccine uptake, self-reported vaccine knowledge, vaccine confidence, and sense of collective responsibility. Complacency (not perceiving disease as high-risk), anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs, perceived vaccine danger, and mistrust in science/scientists were negative correlates of vaccination intentions. Constraints (psychological barriers), calculation (extensive information-searching), analytical thinking, perceived disease vulnerability, self-other overlap, and conservatism were weakly associated with vaccination intentions but not consistently across both studies or vaccine types. Additionally, similar factors were associated with both real and hypothetical vaccination intentions, suggesting that conclusions from pre-COVID vaccine hesitancy research mostly generalize to the current pandemic situation. Conclusion Encouraging flu vaccine uptake, enhancing confidence in a novel vaccine, and fostering a sense of collective responsibility are particularly important as they uniquely predict COVID-19 vaccination intentions. By including both actual pandemic-related hesitancy measures and hypothetical hesitancy measures from past research in the same study, this work provides key context for the generalizability of earlier non-pandemic research."

No studies to our knowledge have studied the risk of iatrogenic radial nerve and/or profunda brachii artery (RNPBA) injury from each screw hole of a 4.5 mm narrow dynamic compression plate (narrow DCP). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the risk of RNPBA injury in anterolateral humeral plating with a 4.5 mm narrow DCP.18 humeri of 9 fresh-frozen cadavers in the supine position were exposed via the anterolateral approach with 45 degrees of arm abduction. A hypothetical fracture line was marked at the midpoint of each humerus. A precontoured ten-hole 4.5mm narrow DCP was applied to the anterolateral surface of the humerus using the fracture line to position the center of the plate. All screw holes were drilled and screws inserted. The cadaver was then turned over to the prone position with 45 degrees of arm abduction, and the RNPBA exposed. The holes through in which 100% of the screw had contact with or penetrated the RNPBA were identified as dangerous screw holes, while lesser percentages of contact were defined as risky.The relative distance ratios of the entire humeral length from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus to the 4th, 3rd, 2nd and 1st proximal holes were 0.64, 0.60, 0.56 and 0.52, respectively. The most dangerous screw hole was the 2nd proximal, in which all 18 screws had contacted or penetrated the nerve, followed by the risky 1st (12/18), 3rd (8/18) and 4th (2/18) holes.In humeral shaft plating with the 4.5mm narrow DCP using the anterolateral approach, the 2nd proximal screw hole carries the highest risk of iatrogenic radial nerve and/or profunda brachii artery injury."

We assessed the impact of chemical restraint protocols on the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) and other blood variables in 36 capybaras and the effect of different flows of nasal oxygen (O2) supplementation. The capybaras were hand-injected with dexmedetomidine (5 μg/kg) and midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) and butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg) (DMB, n = 18) or methadone (0.1 mg/kg) (DMM, n = 18). One-third of the animals were maintained in ambient air throughout the procedure, and one-third were administered intranasal 2 L/min O2 after 30 min whereas the other third were administered 5 L/min O2. Arterial blood gases, acid-base status, and electrolytes were assessed 30 and 60 min after drug injection. The DMB and DMM groups did not vary based on any of the evaluated variables. All animals developed hypoxaemia (PaO2 44 [30; 73] mmHg, SaO2 81 [62; 93] %) 30 min before O2 supplementation. Intranasal O2 at 2 L/min improved PaO2 (63 [49; 97] mmHg and SaO2 [92 [85; 98] %), but 9 of 12 capybaras remained hypoxaemic. A higher O2 flow of 5 L/min was efficient in treating hypoxaemia (PaO2 188 [146; 414] mmHg, SaO2 100 [99; 100] %) in all the 12 animals that received it. Both drug protocols induced hypoxaemia, which could be treated with intranasal oxygen supplementation."
https://openalex.org/W3217389974,"Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn) is a gram-negative intracellular pathogen that causes a variety of pulmonary diseases, and there is growing evidence that it may play a role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. Cpn can interact functionally with host histones, altering the host’s epigenetic regulatory system by introducing bacterial products into the host tissue and inducing a persistent inflammatory response. Because Cpn is difficult to propagate, isolate, and detect, a modified LPS-like neuroinflammation model was established using lyophilized cell free supernatant (CFS) obtained from infected cell cultures, and the effects of CFS were compared to LPS. The neuroprotective effects of Trichostatin A (TSA), givinostat, and RG108, which are effective on epigenetic mechanisms, and the antibiotic rifampin, were studied in this newly introduced model and in the presence of amyloid beta (Aβ) 1–42. The neuroprotective effects of the drugs, as well as the effects of CFS and LPS, were evaluated in Aβ-induced neurotoxicity using a real-time cell analysis system, total ROS, and apoptotic impact. TSA, RG108, givinostat, and rifampin all demonstrated neuroprotective effects in both this novel model and Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. The findings are expected to provide early evidence on neuroprotective actions against Cpn-induced neuroinflammation and Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, which could represent a new treatment option for AD, for which there are currently few treatment options."

A serious game coupled with a classroom session led by lived experience workers (LEWs) might help to overcome these barriers. The school-based Strong Teens and Resilient Minds (STORM) preventive program employed this strategy and offered a serious game, Moving Stories. The current study was carried out to assess inhibiting and promoting factors for scaling up Moving Stories once its effectiveness has been ascertained.Moving Stories was offered in three steps: (1) introductory classroom session, (2) students playing the game for five days, (3) debriefing classroom session led by lived experience worker. Data was collected on the number of participating students, costs of offering Moving Stories, and was further based on the notes of the debriefing sessions to check if mental health first aid (MHFA) strategies were addressed.Moving Stories was offered in seven high-schools. Coverage was moderate with 982 participating students out of 1880 (52%). Most participating students (83%) played the Moving Stories app three out of the five days. Qualitative data showed that the MHFAs were discussed in all debriefing sessions. Students showed great interest in lived experience workers' stories and shared their own experiences with depression.Bringing Moving Stories to scale in the high-school setting appears feasible, but will remain logistically somewhat challenging. Future implementation and scale-up of Moving Stories could benefit from improved selection and training of LEWs that played such an important role in grabbing the full attention of students and were able to launch frank discussions about depressive disorder and stigma in classrooms.The study is registered in the Dutch Trial Register: Trial NL6444 (NTR6622: https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/6444)."
https://openalex.org/W3217661701,"Background Bleeding following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has important prognostic implications. This study sought to evaluate the impact of baseline mean platelet volume (MPV) on bleeding events after TAVR. Methods and results Patients undergoing TAVR between February 2010 and May 2019 were included. Low MPV (L-MPV) was defined as MPV ≤10 fL and high MPV (H-MPV) as MPV &gt;10 fL. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of major/life-threatening bleeding complications (MLBCs) at one-year follow-up. Among 1,111 patients, 398 (35.8%) had L-MPV and 713 (64.2%) had H-MPV. The rate of MLBCs at 1 year was higher in L-MPV patients compared with H-MPV patients (22.9% vs. 17.7% respectively, p = 0.034). L-MPV was associated with vascular access-site complications (36.2% vs. 28.9%, p = 0.012), early (&lt;30 days) major bleeding (15.6% vs. 9.4%, p&lt;0.01) and red blood cell transfusion &gt;2 units (23.9% vs. 17.5%, p = 0.01). No impact of baseline MPV on overall death, cardiovascular death and ischemic events (myocardial infarction and stroke) was evidenced. Multivariate analysis using Fine and Gray model identified preprocedural hemoglobin (sHR 0.84, 95%CI [0.75–0.93], p = 0.001), preprocedural L-MPV (sHR 1.64, 95%CI [1.16–2.32], p = 0.005) and closure time adenosine diphosphate post-TAVR (sHR 2.71, 95%CI [1.87–3.95], p&lt;0.001) as predictors of MLBCs. Conclusions Preprocedural MPV was identified as an independent predictor of MLBCs one year after TAVR, regardless of the extent of platelet inhibition and primary hemostasis disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3215046890,"Thrombolytic and fibrinolytic therapies are effective treatments to dissolve blood clots in stroke therapy. Thrombolytic drugs activate plasminogen to its cleaved form plasmin, a proteolytic enzyme that breaks the crosslinks between fibrin molecules. The FDA-approved human tissue plasminogen activator Reteplase (rPA) is a non-glycosylated protein produced in E . coli . rPA is a deletion mutant of the wild-type Alteplase that benefits from an extended plasma half-life, reduced fibrin specificity and the ability to better penetrate into blood clots. Different methods have been proposed to improve the production of rPA. Here we show for the first time the transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana of rPA fused to the immunoglobulin fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain on an IgG1, a strategy commonly used to improve the stability of therapeutic proteins. Despite our success on the expression and purification of dimeric rPA-Fc fusions, protein instability results in high amounts of Fc-derived degradation products. We hypothesize that the “Y”- shape of dimeric Fc fusions cause steric hindrance between protein domains and leads to physical instability. Indeed, mutations of critical residues in the Fc dimerization interface allowed the expression of fully stable rPA monomeric Fc-fusions. The ability of rPA-Fc to convert plasminogen into plasmin was demonstrated by plasminogen zymography and clot lysis assay shows that rPA-Fc is able to dissolve blood clots ex vivo . Finally, we addressed concerns with the plant-specific glycosylation by modulating rPA-Fc glycosylation towards serum-like structures including α2,6-sialylated and α1,6-core fucosylated N-glycans completely devoid of plant core fucose and xylose residues."
https://openalex.org/W3215086734,"Social behaviors are foundational to society and quality of life while social behavior extremes are core symptoms in a variety of psychopathologies and developmental disabilities. Oxytocin (OXT) is a neuroactive hormone that regulates social behaviors through its receptor (OXTR), with all previously identified social behavior effects attributed to the central nervous system, which has developmental origins in the neural tube. However, OXTR are also present in neural crest-derived tissue including sensory ganglia of the peripheral nervous system. Avil encodes for the actin-binding protein ADVILLIN, is expressed in neural crest-derived cells, and was therefore used as a target in this study to knock out OXTR expression in neural-crest derived cells. Here, we tested if OXTRs specifically expressed in Avil positive neural crest-derived cells are necessary for species-typical adult social behaviors using a Cre-LoxP strategy. Genetically modified male and female mice lacking OXTR in Avil expressing cells (OXTR Avil KO) were tested for sociability and preference for social novelty. Males were also tested for resident intruder aggression. OXTR Avil KO males and females had reduced sociability compared to OXTR Avil WT controls. Additionally, OXTR Avil KO males had increased aggressive behaviors compared to controls. These data indicate that OXTRs in cells of neural crest origin are important regulators of typical social behaviors in C57BL/6J adult male and female mice and point to needed directions of future research."
https://openalex.org/W3216579198,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. While the recent use of immune checkpoint inhibitors significantly improves patient outcomes, responsiveness remains restricted to a small proportion of patients. Conventional dendritic cells (DCs) play a major role in anticancer immunity. In mice, two subpopulations of DCs are found in the lung: DC2s (CD11b+Sirpα+) and DC1s (CD103+XCR1+), the latest specializing in the promotion of anticancer immune responses. However, the impact of lung cancer on DC populations and the consequent influence on the anticancer immune response remain poorly understood. To address this, DC populations were studied in murine models of Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) and melanoma-induced lung metastasis (B16F10). We report that direct exposure to live or dead cancer cells impacts the capacity of DCs to differentiate into CD103+ DC1s, leading to profound alterations in CD103+ DC1 proportions in the lung. In addition, we observed the accumulation of CD103loCD11b+ DCs, which express DC2 markers IRF4 and Sirpα, high levels of T-cell inhibitory molecules PD-L1/2 and the regulatory molecule CD200. Finally, DC1s were injected in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1) in the B16F10 model of resistance to the anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint therapy; the co-injection restored sensitivity to immunotherapy. Thus, we demonstrate that lung tumor development leads to the accumulation of CD103loCD11b+ DCs with a regulatory potential combined with a reduced proportion of highly-specialized antitumor CD103+ DC1s, which could promote cancer growth. Additionally, promoting an anticancer DC signature could be an interesting therapeutic avenue to increase the efficacy of existing immune checkpoint inhibitors."

We investigated mean arterially recorded blood pressure (MAP) changes during the first day of life in VLBW infants as potential risk factors for a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and IVH. This retrospective cohort study exploring MAP changes during adaption and risk factors for a PDA and IVH comprised 844 VLBW infants admitted to the Helsinki University Children's Hospital during 2005-2013. For each infant, we investigated 600 time-points of MAP recorded 4-24 hours after birth. Based on blood pressure patterns revealed by a data-driven method, we divided the infants into two groups. Group 1 (n = 327, mean birthweight = 1019 g, mean gestational age = 28 + 1/7 weeks) consisted of infants whose mean MAP was lower at 18-24 hours than at 4-10 hours after birth. Group 2 (n = 517, mean birthweight = 1070 g, mean gestational age = 28 + 5/7 weeks) included infants with a higher mean MAP at 18-24 hours than at 4-10 hours after birth. We used the group assignments, MAP, gestational age at birth, relative size for gestational age, surfactant administration, inotrope usage, invasive ventilation, presence of respiratory distress syndrome or sepsis, fluid intake, and administration of antenatal steroids to predict the occurrence of IVH and use of pharmacological or surgical therapy for a PDA before 42 weeks of gestational age. Infants whose mean MAP is lower at 18-24 hours than at 4-10 hours after birth are more likely to undergo surgical ligation of a PDA (odds ratio = 2.1; CI 1.14-3.89; p = 0.018) and to suffer from IVH (odds ratio = 1.83; CI 1.23-2.72; p = 0.003)."
https://openalex.org/W3217015959,"To conduct a cross-sectional nationwide study examining how exclusion of nursing home COVID-19 cases influences the association between county level social distancing behavior and COVID-19 cases throughout the US during the early phase of the pandemic (February 2020-May 2020).Using county-level COVID-19 data and social distancing metrics from tracked mobile devices, we investigated the impact social distancing had on a county's total COVID-19 cases (cases/100,000 people) between when the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in a county and May 31st, 2020 when most statewide social distancing measures were lifted, representing the pandemic's exponential growth phase. We created a mixed-effects negative binomial model to assess how implementation of social distancing measures when they were most stringent (March 2020-May 2020) influenced total COVID-19 cases while controlling for social distancing and COVID-19 related covariates in two scenarios: (1) when COVID-19 nursing home cases are not excluded from total COVID-19 cases and (2) when these cases are excluded. Model findings were compared to those from February 2020, a baseline when social distancing measures were not in place. Marginal effects at the means were generated to further isolate the influence of social distancing on COVID-19 from other factors and determine total COVID-19 cases during March 2020-May 2020 for the two scenarios.Regardless of whether nursing home COVID-19 cases were excluded from total COVID-19 cases, a 1% increase in average % of mobile devices leaving home was significantly associated with a 5% increase in a county's total COVID-19 cases between March 2020-May 2020 and about a 2.5% decrease in February 2020. When the influence of social distancing was separated from other factors, the estimated total COVID-19 cases/100,000 people was comparable throughout the range of social distancing values (25%-45% of mobile phone devices leaving home between March 2020-May 2020) when nursing home COVID-19 cases were not excluded (25% of mobile phones leaving home: 163.84 cases/100,000 people (95% CI: 121.81, 205.86), 45% of mobile phones leaving home: 432.79 cases/100,000 people (95% CI: 256.91, 608.66)) and when they were excluded (25% of mobile phones leaving home: 149.58 cases/100,000 people (95% CI: 111.90, 187.26), 45% of mobile phones leaving home: 405.38 cases/100,000 people (95% CI: 243.14, 567.62)).Exclusion of nursing home COVID-19 cases from total COVID-19 case counts has little impact when estimating the relationship between county-level social distancing and preventing COVID-19 cases with additional research needed to see whether this finding is also observed for COVID-19 growth rates and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3217152364,"Recorded serum 25(OH)D in survey data varies with observed and unobserved respondent characteristics. The aim of this study was to expose latent population sub-groups and examine variation across groups regarding relationships between serum 25(OH)D and observable characteristics.This study explored the role of unobserved heterogeneity on associations between surveyed 25(OH)D and various factors using a sample (n = 2,641) extracted from the Saudi Health Interview Survey (2013). Linear regression and finite mixture models (FMM) were estimated and compared. The number of latent classes in the FMM was chosen based on BIC score.Three latent classes were identified. Class I (39.82%), class II (41.03%), and class III (19.15%) with mean 25(OH)D levels of 22.79, 34.88, and 57.45 ng/ml respectively. Distinct patterns of associations with nutrition, behaviour and socio-demographic variables were recorded across classes that were not revealed in pooled linear regression.FMM has the potential to provide additional insights on the relationship between 25(OH)D levels and observable characteristics. It should be more widely considered as a method of investigation in this area."
