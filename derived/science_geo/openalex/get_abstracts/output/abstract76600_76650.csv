Yet varieties of this species are used as a salad delicacy in the Philippines and lack it. We have attempted to discover the nature of the flavour-giving substance, having in mind its recognition for chemotaxonomic purposes. One of us (G. A.-S.) was able to obtain from ether extracts adsorbed on and then eluted from alumina crystalline material which melts at 95° C. We have named this material “caulerpicin”. Mass spectrometry indicates that caulerpicin has a molecular weight of 649 with a possible formula of C43H87O2N and properties unlike those of any other compound of which we are aware. The infra-red spectrum indicates that caulerpicin may be a long-chain saturated hydroxy amide. So far it has been found in several Caulerpa species or varieties in different concentrations; as much as 600 mg have been isolated from 1,500 g dry weight of one variety of Caulerpa racemosa (Forsskal) J. Agardh."

The following methods have been used during screening of fungal strains and media for toxin production."

The direct influence of magnetic fields on chemical equilibrium or rate of reaction has occasionally been reported; however, this cannot usually be reproduced, and the general weight of evidence is that such effects are insignificant2. No satisfactory picture of what a weak magnetic field can do to molecular-level phenomena seems to have been advanced."

https://openalex.org/W2066195761,EARLIER investigations1–4 on the fluorescent material in calcified tissues have indicated that it is associated with the collagenous organic matrix of these tissues. Observations on soluble tissue matrix preparations showed they had excitation maxima at 330 mµ with corresponding emission maxima about 400 mµ.

In the course of this work it was observed that large lymphocytes, which make up most of the cellular component of thoracic duct lymph in the lymphocyte-depleted calf, can be divided rather distinctly into two populations according to the distributions of their ribosomes."

A column of the styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer-type sulphonic acid cation exchange resin, Dowex 50 W-X 4 (− 100, + 200 mesh, Dow Chemical Co.), in the hydrogen form (bed length, 53 cm; bed volume, 131 c.c.) has been used for this purpose."

We have had occasion to study the effect on gastric secretion when degraded carrageenin is administered subcutaneously. The results indicate that carrageenin parenterally has a pronounced inhibitory action on the acid secretory response to histamine but, somewhat paradoxically, not on the secretory response to ‘Histalog’ (betazole hydrochloride), a structural isomer of histamine."

Of a total of 185 P. hauseri (P. mirabilis + P. vulgaris), 155 P. morganii, 29 P. rettgeri and 239 Providence strains qualitatively examined for the presence of this enzyme2–4, all but two Providence strains3 were positive, although P. morganii strains have been reported to yield on occasions weak or negative results5."

Greene et al.3 almost achieved this separation on activated charcoal, but resolution of oxygen and nitrogen with this adsorbent was incomplete."

https://openalex.org/W2082827415,"PHOTOPRODUCTS of pyrimidines are known to play an important part in the inactivation of nucleic acids by ultra-violet light. The replicative form (RF) of phage φ X 174 DNA is a convenient material to use for an investigation of the dependence of DNA ultra-violet sensitivity on base composition. The properties of both strands of RF DNA are similar, yet their nucleotide composition differs: the complementary strand contains 8.2 per cent less thymine and 5.6 per cent more cytosine than the phage strand1,2. The present investigation was undertaken to compare the ultra-violet inactivation of the infectivity of both chains of RF φ X 174 DNA."
