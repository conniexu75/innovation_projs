https://openalex.org/W2134859255,"Detectors aboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory have observed an unexplained terrestrial phenomenon: brief, intense flashes of gamma rays. These flashes must originate in the atmosphere at altitudes above at least 30 kilometers in order to escape atmospheric absorption and reach the orbiting detectors. At least a dozen such events have been detected over the past 2 years. The photon spectra from the events are very hard (peaking in the high-energy portion of the spectrum) and are consistent with bremsstrahlung emission from energetic (million-electron volt) electrons. The most likely origin of these high-energy electrons, although speculative at this time, is a rare type of high-altitude electrical discharge above thunderstorm regions."

It is known that for k = 2, formulas are almost always satisfiable when the ratio of clauses to variables is less than 1; for ratios larger than 1, the formulas are almost never satisfiable. Similar sharp threshold behavior is observed for higher values of k. Finite-size scaling, a method from statistical physics, can be used to characterize size-dependent effects near the threshold. A relationship can be drawn between thresholds and computational complexity."
https://openalex.org/W2057320315,"The Chinese Early Cambrian Chengjiang fauna includes three different anomalocaridids, a globally spread, extinct marine group including the largest known Cambrian animals. Anomalocaridids were active predators, and their presence implies that a complex ecosystem appeared abruptly in the earliest Phanerozoic. Complete specimens display several sets of characters shared only with some other exclusively Cambrian forms. This evidence indicates that anomalocaridids, Opabinia, and Kerygmachela form a monophyletic clade. Certain features indicate arthropod affinities of the lade, and for this group an unnamed (sub)phylum-level taxon within an arthropod (super)phylum is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2060620327,"Vibrational spectroscopy with inelastic neutron scattering can provide spectra that are more detailed and easier to interpret than optical spectra. The spectral intensity depends on energy transfer and kinetic momentum transfer, allowing determination of the potential function. Experiments reveal that the proton involved in intermolecular hydrogen bonding in N-methylacetamide and polyglycine I vibrates almost independently. An ionic representation (N(delta-)...H(+)...O(delta-)) of the hydrogen bond is more realistic than the normally accepted covalent model (NH...O). For polyglycine I, the proton experiences a local, symmetric double-minimum potential arising from dynamic exchange between the amide-like (CONH) and imidol-like (HOCN) forms of the peptide unit."
https://openalex.org/W1967567045,"At least three great earthquakes occurred in the New Madrid seismic zone in 1811 and 1812. Estimates of present-day strain rates suggest that such events may have a repeat time of 1000 years or less. Paleoseismological data also indicate that earthquakes large enough to cause soil liquefaction have occurred several times in the past 5000 years. However, pervasive crustal deformation expected from such a high frequency of large earthquakes is not observed. This suggests that the seismic zone is a young feature, possibly as young as several tens of thousands of years old and no more than a few million years old."
https://openalex.org/W1995089898,"Most of the principal qualitative features of the El Niño—Southern Oscillation phenomenon can be explained by a simple but physically motivated theory. These features are the occurrence of sea-surface warmings in the eastern equatorial Pacific and the associated trade wind reversal; the aperiodicity of these events; the preferred onset time with respect to the seasonal cycle; and the much weaker events in the Atlantic and Indian oceans. The theory, in its simplest form, is a conceptual model for the interaction of just three variables, namely near-surface temperatures in the east and west equatorial ocean and a wind-driven current advecting the temperature field. For a large range of parameters, the model is naturally chaotic and aperiodically produces El Niño—like events. For a smaller basin, representing a smaller ocean, the events are proportionally less intense."
https://openalex.org/W1985869178,"The x-ray diffraction of the nonsuperconducting ternary fulleride Li(2)CsC(60) reveals at room temperature a face-centered-cubic (Fm3m) disordered structure that persists to a temperature of 13 Kelvin. The crystal structure is best modeled as containing quasispherical [radius of 3.556(4) angstroms] C(60)(3-) ions, in sharp contrast to their orientational state in superconducting face-centered-cubic K(3)C(60) (merohedral disorder) and primitive cubic Na(2)CsC(60) (orientational order). The orientational disorder of the carbon atoms on the C(60)(3-) sphere was analyzed with symmetry-adapted spherical-harmonic functions. Excess atomic density is evident in the <111> directions, indicating strong bonding Li(+)-C interactions, not encountered before in any of the superconducting alkali fullerides. The intercalate-carbon interactions and the orientational state of the fullerenes have evidently affected the superconducting pair-binding mechanism in this material."

https://openalex.org/W2067911357,"A functionalized surfactant has been investigated as floating monolayers by synchrotron x-ray diffraction and as bilayers transferred to solid supports by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique through atomic force microscopy. The transfer process is accompanied by an increase of the unit cell area (about 17 percent) and by an increase of the average domain diameter of nanometer-scale domains (about three times). The unit cell area of the floating monolayer corresponds to close packing of the head groups and a noncharacteristic packing of the tifted alkyl chains. The larger unit cell area of the bilayer film is consistent with a particular ordered packing of the alkyl chains, leaving free space for the head groups."

It is a representation of the mu 3-3 isozyme of rat liver glutathione S-transferase with an inhibitor, 9-(S-glutathionyl)-10-hydroxy-9, 10-dihydrophenanthrene. The structure was determined at the Center for Advanced Research in Biotechnology as a result of collaborative work between the laboratory of Gary L. Gilliland and that of Richard Armstrong in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Maryland, College Park [X. Ji et al., Biochemistry 33, 1043 (1994)]."
