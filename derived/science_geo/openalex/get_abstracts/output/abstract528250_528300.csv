https://openalex.org/W1503270516,"Many animals navigate using a combination of visual landmarks and path integration. In mammalian brains, head direction cells integrate these two streams of information by representing an animal's heading relative to landmarks, yet maintaining their directional tuning in darkness based on self-motion cues. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed Drosophila melanogaster walking on a ball in a virtual reality arena to demonstrate that landmark-based orientation and angular path integration are combined in the population responses of neurons whose dendrites tile the ellipsoid body, a toroidal structure in the centre of the fly brain. The neural population encodes the fly's azimuth relative to its environment, tracking visual landmarks when available and relying on self-motion cues in darkness. When both visual and self-motion cues are absent, a representation of the animal's orientation is maintained in this network through persistent activity, a potential substrate for short-term memory. Several features of the population dynamics of these neurons and their circular anatomical arrangement are suggestive of ring attractors, network structures that have been proposed to support the function of navigational brain circuits."

https://openalex.org/W1824902482,"Local galaxies are broadly divided into two main classes, star-forming (gas-rich) and quiescent (passive and gas-poor). The primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation in galaxies and transforming them into quiescent and passive systems is still unclear. Sudden removal of gas through outflows or stripping is one of the mechanisms often proposed. An alternative mechanism is so-called ""strangulation"", in which the supply of cold gas to the galaxy is halted. Here we report that the difference between quiescent and star forming galaxies in terms of stellar metallicity (i.e. the fraction of metals heavier than helium in stellar atmospheres) can be used to discriminate efficiently between the two mechanisms. The analysis of the stellar metallicity in local galaxies, from 26,000 spectra, clearly reveals that strangulation is the primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation, with a typical timescale of 4 billion years, at least for local galaxies with a stellar mass less than 10^11 solar masses. This result is further supported independently by the stellar age difference between quiescent and star-forming galaxies, which indicates that quiescent galaxies of less than 10^11 solar masses are on average observed four billion years after quenching due to strangulation."

https://openalex.org/W782467378,"Endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) was originally described in heart development where the endocardial endothelial cells that line the atrioventricular canal undergo an EndMT to form the endocardial mesenchymal cushion that later gives rise to the septum and mitral and tricuspid valves. In the postnatal heart specifically, endothelial cells that originate from the endocardium maintain increased susceptibility to undergo EndMT as remnants from their embryonic origin. Such EndMT involving adult coronary endothelial cells contributes to microvascular rarefaction and subsequent chronification of hypoxia in the injured heart, ultimately leading to cardiac fibrosis. Although in most endothelial beds hypoxia induces tip cell formation and sprouting angiogenesis, here we demonstrate that hypoxia is a stimulus for human coronary endothelial cells to undergo phenotypic changes reminiscent of EndMT via a mechanism involving hypoxia-inducible factor 1α-induced activation of the EndMT master regulatory transcription factor SNAIL. Our study adds further evidence for the unique susceptibility of endocardium-derived endothelial cells to undergo EndMT and provides novel insights into how hypoxia contributes to progression of cardiac fibrosis. Additional studies may be required to discriminate between distinct sprouting angiogenesis and EndMT responses of different endothelial cells populations."

Here, we evaluated the antiviral effects of tetracycline (TETRA) derivatives and other common antiviral agents against CHIKV. Our results showed that within the TETRA derivatives group, Doxycycline (DOXY) exhibited the highest inhibitory effect against CHIKV replication in Vero cells. On the other hand, in the antiviral group Ribavirin (RIBA) showed higher inhibitory effects against CHIKV replication compared to Aciclovir (ACIC). Interestingly, RIBA inhibitory effects were also higher than all but DOXY within the TETRA derivatives group. Docking studies of DOXY to viral cysteine protease and E2 envelope protein showed non-competitive interaction with docking energy of -6.6±0.1 and -6.4±0.1 kcal/mol respectively. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) of DOXY and RIBA was determined to be 10.95±2.12 μM and 15.51±1.62 μM respectively, while DOXY+RIBA (1:1 combination) showed an EC50 of 4.52±1.42 μM. When compared, DOXY showed higher inhibition of viral infectivity and entry than RIBA. In contrast however, RIBA showed higher inhibition against viral replication in target cells compared to DOXY. Assays using mice as animal models revealed that DOXY+RIBA effectively inhibited CHIKV replication and attenuated its infectivity in vivo. Further experimental and clinical studies are warranted to investigate their potential application for clinical intervention of CHIKV disease."
https://openalex.org/W368003498,"A total of 13 phosphate transporters in rice (Oryza sative) have been identified as belonging to the Pht1 family, which mediates inorganic phosphate (Pi) uptake and transport. We report the biological property and physiological role of OsPht1;4 (OsPT4). Overexpressing OsPT4 resulted in significant higher Pi accumulation in roots, straw and brown rice, and suppression of OsPT4 caused decreased Pi concentration in straw and brown rice. Expression of the β-glucuronidase reporter gene driven by the OsPT4 promoter showed that OsPT4 is expressed in roots, leaves, ligules, stamens, and caryopses under sufficient Pi conditions, consistent with the expression profile showing that OsPT4 has high expression in roots and flag leaves. The transcript level of OsPT4 increased significantly both in shoots and roots with a long time Pi starvation. OsPT4 encoded a plasma membrane-localized protein and was able to complement the function of the Pi transporter gene PHO84 in yeast. We concluded that OsPT4 is a functional Pi-influx transporter involved in Pi absorption in rice that might play a role in Pi translocation. This study will enrich our understanding about the physiological function of rice Pht1 family genes."
https://openalex.org/W253353733,"The female gametophyte of flowering plants, called the embryo sac, develops from a haploid cell named the functional megaspore, which is specified after meiosis by the diploid sporophyte. In Arabidopsis, the functional megaspore undergoes three syncitial mitotic divisions followed by cellularization to form seven cells of four cell types including two female gametes. The plant hormone auxin is important for sporophytic developmental processes, and auxin levels are known to be regulated by biosynthesis and transport. Here, we investigated the role of auxin biosynthetic genes and auxin influx carriers in embryo sac development. We find that genes from the YUCCA/TAA pathway (YUC1, YUC2, YUC8, TAA1, TAR2) are expressed asymmetrically in the developing ovule and embryo sac from the two-nuclear syncitial stage until cellularization. Mutants for YUC1 and YUC2 exhibited defects in cell specification, whereas mutations in YUC8, as well as mutations in TAA1 and TAR2, caused defects in nuclear proliferation, vacuole formation and anisotropic growth of the embryo sac. Additionally, expression of the auxin influx carriers AUX1 and LAX1 were observed at the micropylar pole of the embryo sac and in the adjacent cells of the ovule, and the aux1 lax1 lax2 triple mutant shows multiple gametophyte defects. These results indicate that both localized auxin biosynthesis and auxin import, are required for mitotic divisions, cell expansion and patterning during embryo sac development."

ZIP member proteins have eight transmembrane domains and can be further classified into subfamilies (ZIPI, ZIPII, gufA, and LIV-1) based on sequence alignments (5Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Eukaryotic zinc transporters and their regulation.Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The largest subfamily, LIV-1, is distinct from other ZIP proteins as its members encode a highly conserved sequence (HSVFEGLAVGIQ) in transmembrane domain (TM) 4 that has been proposed to be important for transition metal transport (6Dufner-Beattie J. Langmade S.J. Wang F. Eide D. Andrews G.K. Structure, function, and regulation of a subfamily of mouse zinc transporter genes.J. Biol.

The Znt family of proteins functions in opposition to ZIP member proteins as they act to decrease the cytosolic concentration of zinc (10Kambe T. Molecular architecture and function of ZnT transporters.in: Lutsenko S. Arguello J.M. Metal Transporters. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2012: 199-220Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the crystal structure of the bacterial Znt protein, YiiP, and subsequent functional studies have provided insight into the molecular details of transition metal transport mediated by Znt proteins (11Coudray N.

The six TM YiiP protein encodes a TM transition metal coordination site and is dimeric, and both termini are cytoplasmic. Znt transporters belong to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family. CDF proteins are found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (14Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. A novel family of ubiquitous heavy metal ion transport proteins.J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Member transporters translocate first and/or second row transition metals (2Dempski R.E.

Molecular architecture and function of ZnT transporters.in: Lutsenko S. Arguello J.M. Metal Transporters. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2012: 199-220Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Both Znt and ZIP proteins are part of a larger group of transport proteins, named solute carrier (SLC) proteins. This group of proteins includes 52 families that function as facilitative or secondary active transporters, such as the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) (15Hediger M.A. Romero M.F. Peng J.B. Rolfs A. Takanaga H. Bruford E.A.

Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. Major facilitator superfamily.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MFS transporters encode 12 TMs and transport small solutes in response to chemiosmotic gradients. Although mechanistic linkages among family members are being studied, structural linkages between families of SLC group proteins are sparse. The absence of structural information for ZIP transporters has limited the scope and impact of mechanistic studies as it is not possible to decipher whether mutations that affect the kinetics and/or cation selectivity of ZIP proteins directly or indirectly affect transport function. Thus, the molecular mechanism of transition metal transport mediated by ZIP proteins is not resolved. In this study, we take advantage of recent progress in predicting residue pair contacts in a protein structure using co-evolution data to generate the first molecular model of hZIP4 using Rosetta in combination with co-evolution data (17Simons K.T. Ruczinski I. Kooperberg C. Fox B.A. Bystroff C. Baker D.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 15674-15679Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies that probe residues important for transition metal translocation and specificity are consistent with the model of hZIP4. Furthermore, the model has a similarity to the central transition metal coordination site of the Znt exporter, YiiP (11Coudray N. Valvo S. Hu M. Lasala R. Kim C. Vink M. Zhou M. Provasi D.

Comparison of these structures suggests that the Znt and ZIP families may share a common metal selectivity for zinc. The SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit was acquired from Invitrogen. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). The XL-1 Blue supercompetent cells were obtained from Agilent (Santa Clara, CA). Pfu polymerase was procured from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The radioisotopes 65ZnCl2 and 59FeCl3 were purchased from PerkinElmer. All transition metal chloride salts were purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA). Additional chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated. GREMLIN, a contact prediction method that utilizes co-evolution, was used to predict residue-residue contacts in hZIP4. GREMLIN constructs a global statistical model that simultaneously captures the conservation and co-evolution patterns in the input alignment. Strongly co-evolving residue pairs as identified by this approach are highly likely to be in contact with each other in the three-dimensional structure (18Kamisetty H. Ovchinnikov S. Baker D. Assessing the utility of coevolution-based residue-residue contact predictions in a sequence- and structure-rich era.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 15674-15679Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The input sequence of hZIP4 was trimmed to only include the following residues: 328–427 and 487–642. This trimmed sequence excludes the extracellular N-terminal domain and the only significant intracellular domain between TM3 and TM4. Both of these domains have substantial variation between species. A multiple sequence alignment was generated using HHblits (19Söding J. Protein homology detection by HMM-HMM comparison.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar) with the following options: n, 8; e, 1 × 10−20; maxfilt, ∞; neffmax, 20; nodiff, realign_max ∞. The resulting alignment was then filtered to exclude any sequence that did not cover at least 50% of the query and to reduce the sequence redundancy to 90%. GREMLIN was then run with default parameters. The standard Rosetta ab initio structure prediction method was used to model the three-dimensional structure of hZIP4 trimmed to only include residues 328–648. The default Rosetta energy function was modified to enable membrane specific terms with the following weights: fa_sol, 0.0; fa_mbenv, 0.3; fa_mbsolv, 0.35; and Menv_smooth, 0.5 (20Barth P.

Transmembrane spans (residues 2–23, 33–53, 74–95, 167–191, 197–222, 228–252, 259–282, and 290–314) were defined using the consensus output of the MESSA server (22Cong Q. Grishin N.V. MESSA: MEta-Server for protein Sequence Analysis.BMC Biol. 2012; 10: 82Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To reduce the sampling space, sigmoidal restraints that modified the energy function were introduced. The shape of the sigmoid is defined using a distance cutoff, the slope, the intercept, and the strength of the weight parameter (Fig. 1A). The Rosetta ab initio protocol consists of two stages. In the initial stage (“centroid”), side chains are represented by fixed center-of-mass atoms allowing for rapid generation and evaluation of various protein-like topologies; the second stage (“full-atom”) places all-atom side chains into a starting topology and iteratively refines the model until a low energy structure is found (17Simons K.T. Ruczinski I. Kooperberg C. Fox B.A. Bystroff C. Baker D.

To favor sampling of topologies consistent with GREMLIN predictions, sigmoidal distance restraints (Fig. 1A) were introduced between residue pairs predicted to be in contact by GREMLIN (Fig. 2). When used in the centroid stage of Rosetta, these restraints were introduced between carbon-β atoms (carbon-α in the case of glycine), at amino acid pair-specific Cβ-Cβ cutoff and slopes, as described in Supporting Information Table 3 within Ref. 18Kamisetty H. Ovchinnikov S. Baker D. Assessing the utility of coevolution-based residue-residue contact predictions in a sequence- and structure-rich era.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 15674-15679Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar; in the full-atom stage, these were replaced with ambiguous distance restraints between side-chain heavy atoms (cutoff of 5.5 and slope of 4) (24Lange O.F.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 10873-10878Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The relative weight of each restraint was based on the GREMLIN score. The total atom pair restraint score was scaled to be roughly one-half the total Rosetta score. In addition to these restraints, additional strong repulsive distance restraints (weight 100, cutoff 35, slope 2, and intercept of 100) were added between extracellular regions (defined by residues 329, 391,522, 582, and 648) and intracellular regions (defined by residues 353, 425, 490, 553, and 615), and strong attractive restraints (weight 100, cutoff 35, slope 2 and intercept of 0) were added within intracellular regions and extracellular regions, effectively constructing a membrane-like sampling space (Fig. 1B). These restraints were introduced between pairs of Cα atoms. The top 1010 models ranked by distance restraints score, with z-score ≥2 (Fig. 3), were clustered based on structural similarity as calculated by TM-score (25Zhang Y. Skolnick J. Scoring function for automated assessment of protein structure template quality.Proteins. 2004; 57: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar) after excluding the disordered regions (positions 428–486 and 643–648) (26Bafaro E.

Clusters were defined as connected components of a network, where each edge is between models with TM-score ≥0.7. The selected model was then further energy-minimized with Rosetta to remove clashes, while respecting structural symmetry and GREMLIN restraints (27DiMaio F. Leaver-Fay A. Bradley P. Baker D. André I. Modeling symmetric macromolecular structures in Rosetta3.PLoS One. 2011; 6e20450Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Preparation of plasmid construct and mRNA was performed as described previously (3Antala S. Dempski R.E. The human ZIP4 transporter has two distinct binding affinities and mediates transport of multiple transition metals.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following mutagenesis, the entire gene was sequenced. Oocytes were extracted from X. laevis in accordance with Worcester Polytechnic Institute Animal Care and Use committee-approved protocol (3Antala S. Dempski R.E.

Dempski R.E. Examining the conformational dynamics of membrane proteins in situ with site-directed fluorescence labeling.J. Vis. Exp. 2011; 10.3791/2627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes were digested with collagenase (3 mg/ml) for 3 h. Following enzymatic digestion, oocytes were rinsed with ORI−Ca2+ buffer (90 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, and 5 mm MOPS at pH 7.4) three times and stored in ORI+Ca2+ (ORI−Ca2+ buffer with 2 mm CaCl2 and 20 μg/ml gentamycin) buffer overnight at 16 °C. mRNA or diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water was injected into each oocyte using a micro-injector and stored in ORI+Ca2+ buffer for 3 days at 16 °C. Radioisotope uptake assays were performed 72 h following injection (3Antala S. Dempski R.E. The human ZIP4 transporter has two distinct binding affinities and mediates transport of multiple transition metals.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were washed with uptake buffer (90 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mm ascorbic acid). Oocytes were incubated in uptake buffer containing 65ZnCl2 for 1 h. At the conclusion of the transport assay, oocytes were washed three times with uptake buffer and solubilized in 200 μl of 1% w/v SDS solution. Solubilized oocytes were mixed with scintillation fluid (Scintisafe-30%, Fisher Scientific) and subjected to radioactivity measurement using a Beckman LS6500 multi-purpose scintillation counter. For iron uptake assays, 59FeCl2 was added as 59FeCl3 in the presence of 1 mm ascorbic acid. For competition experiments, 3 μm 65ZnCl2 was added to 600 μm of various transition metals. For control, no additional transition metal was added. In these experiments, it is necessary to subtract diethyl pyrocarbonate/water-injected controls at each concentration of zinc during the uptake assay to eliminate background radioisotope uptake. The resulting data points were fit with the equation: y = (Vmax × [Zn2+]n)/Kmn + [Zn2+]n where Vmax is the maximal velocity, [Zn2+] is the concentration of divalent metal ion, Km is the concentration of divalent metal at one-half Vmax, and n is the Hill co-efficient. hZIP4 surface expression was detected using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin and biotinylation kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 35 oocytes 72 h after injection were washed three times with ice-cold PBS (0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2) before incubating them with 2 ml of biotinylation buffer. Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin was dissolved in PBS to a final concentration of 0.11 mg/ml, and oocytes were incubated with biotinylation buffer for 90 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The reaction was stopped upon the addition of 200 μl of quenching solution. Biotin-labeled oocytes were washed four times with TBS (0.025 m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2). Finally, oocytes were resuspended in 500 μl of solubilization buffer (TBS buffer containing 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and 1 mm PMSF). Oocytes were homogenized by passing them through a 25-gauge needle. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected into microcentrifuge tubes. The pellet was resuspended in solubilization buffer and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were mixed and incubated with 50 μl of NeutrAvidin resin at room temperature for 60 min with gentle shaking. The resin was washed four times with solubilization buffer. Finally, biotinylated proteins were eluted by boiling resin with Laemmli buffer for 20 min. The eluted biotinylated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE. hZIP4 was detected by Western blot with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the N terminus of hZIP4 (Aviva Systems Biology, San Diego, CA). Loosely adapting the protocol from Dürr et al. (29Dürr K.L. Tavraz N.N. Dempski R.E. Bamberg E. Friedrich T.

The supernatant was collected in a separate microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged (1 min at 100 × g and 4 °C). The procedure was repeated until no pellet was observed upon centrifugation. The supernatant was then spun down at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in solubilizing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% w/v n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and 1 mm PMSF) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The insoluble fraction was separated by high speed centrifugation (14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was added into Laemmli buffer in the absence of reducing agent. The solubilized total membrane proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE. The Western blot was developed using rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against N terminus of hZIP4 (Aviva Systems Biology). A model of hZIP4 was generated using predicted contacts and Rosetta (18Kamisetty H. Ovchinnikov S. Baker D. Assessing the utility of coevolution-based residue-residue contact predictions in a sequence- and structure-rich era.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 15674-15679Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Functional studies support this model. The structure comparison method was then used to compare the hZIP4 structural model with non-redundant Protein Data Bank (PDB) membrane protein structures (30Xu J. Zhang Y.

Membrane structures have been modeled using contact prediction based on co-evolutionary patterns in large multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins (32Hopf T.A. Colwell L.J. Sheridan R.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: E1540-E1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To see whether such an analysis was possible for hZIP4, we constructed an alignment over the conserved transmembrane region by querying the UniProt database with HHblits (19Söding J. Protein homology detection by HMM-HMM comparison.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar, 34Wu C.H. Apweiler R. Bairoch A. Natale D.A. Barker W.C. Boeckmann B.

The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt): an expanding universe of protein information.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D187-D191Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). The resulting non-redundant alignment contained 1731 homologous sequences, 6.8 sequences per length of 255, which is more than the minimum sequences (5 sequences per length) required to predict residue pairs in contact in the three-dimensional structure of hZIP4 using GREMLIN, a co-evolution-based contact prediction approach that is more accurate than other extant approaches (18Kamisetty H. Ovchinnikov S. Baker D. Assessing the utility of coevolution-based residue-residue contact predictions in a sequence- and structure-rich era.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 15674-15679Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). These predictions were then used as distance restraints in the Rosetta ab initio protocol along with other membrane-specific terms to generate over 100,000 structural models of hZIP4 using a distributed computing network, [email protected] Of these, the top 1010 models based on restraint score were extracted. These models formed three large clusters (Fig. 4), of which one cluster agreed with GREMLIN predictions and formed physically realistic structures. Despite this extensive sampling, we observed one set of predicted contacts that were consistently not made by the structural models (Fig. 4A). Further inspection revealed that it was physically impossible to make all these contacts in regions between TM2–3 and TM7–8, without breaking contacts between other helices in a monomeric state. The top 384 (1.5 × length of query) co-evolving pairs of residues that were at least three residues apart (Fig. 2) in the protein sequence were then selected to be used in subsequent structural modeling in Rosetta. Using these top co-evolving pairs, an oligomeric interface could be readily made (Figs. 5, B and C, and 6). Notable for these results is that each of the variants in cluster within Fig. 4A can make the dimer interface as shown in Fig. 6. Equally, these models have histidine residues lining the transmembrane core forming a potential permeating pathway (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 6Variations within cluster A are consistent within context of a dimer. When we examine variation within cluster A, we find that the models are capable of making the remainder of the top co-evolving residues in the context of a dimer. For example, if we reconnect the loop regions between helices 2 and 3, swapping helix 3 between the homo-dimer (A ≥ B), this preserves all predicted helical contacts. Another example would be to reconnect the loop between helices 7 and 8, swapping helix 8 (A ≥ C), or a combination of both (A ≥ D). These swaps are represented in the variation of the top cluster (Fig. 4A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our laboratory has demonstrated that covalent labeling of histidine, but not cysteine residues, decreases the velocity of Zn2+ transport (3Antala S.

https://openalex.org/W414949119,"The blue-gum chalcid Leptocybe invasa Fisher & LaSalle (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is a gall wasp pest of Eucalyptus species, likely native to Australia. Over the past 15 years it has invaded 39 countries on all continents where eucalypts are grown. The worldwide invasion of the blue gum chalcid was attributed to a single thelytokous morphospecies formally described in 2004. Subsequently, however, males have been recorded in several countries and the sex ratio of field populations has been found to be highly variable in different areas. In order to find an explanation for such sex ratio differences, populations of L. invasa from a broad geographical area were screened for the symbionts currently known as reproductive manipulators, and both wasps and symbionts were genetically characterized using multiple genes. Molecular analyses suggested that L. invasa is in fact a complex of two cryptic species involved in the rapid and efficient spread of the wasp, the first recovered from the Mediterranean region and South America, the latter from China. All screened specimens were infected by endosymbiotic bacteria belonging to the genus Rickettsia. Two closely related Rickettsia strains were found, each infecting one of the two putative cryptic species of L. invasa and associated with different average sex ratios. Rickettsia were found to be localized in the female reproductive tissues and transovarially transmitted, suggesting a possible role of Rickettsia as the causal agent of thelytokous parthenogenesis in L. invasa. Implications for the variation of sex ratio and for the management of L. invasa are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1866504702,"The adverse effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy are known, but the molecular events that lead to the phenotypic characteristics are unclear. To unravel the molecular mechanisms, we have used a mouse model of gestational ethanol exposure, which is based on maternal ad libitum ingestion of 10% (v/v) ethanol for the first 8 days of gestation (GD 0.5-8.5). Early neurulation takes place by the end of this period, which is equivalent to the developmental stage early in the fourth week post-fertilization in human. During this exposure period, dynamic epigenetic reprogramming takes place and the embryo is vulnerable to the effects of environmental factors. Thus, we hypothesize that early ethanol exposure disrupts the epigenetic reprogramming of the embryo, which leads to alterations in gene regulation and life-long changes in brain structure and function. Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in the mouse hippocampus revealed altered expression of 23 genes and three miRNAs in ethanol-exposed, adolescent offspring at postnatal day (P) 28. We confirmed this result by using two other tissues, where three candidate genes are known to express actively. Interestingly, we found a similar trend of upregulated gene expression in bone marrow and main olfactory epithelium. In addition, we observed altered DNA methylation in the CpG islands upstream of the candidate genes in the hippocampus. Our MRI study revealed asymmetry of brain structures in ethanol-exposed adult offspring (P60): we detected ethanol-induced enlargement of the left hippocampus and decreased volume of the left olfactory bulb. Our study indicates that ethanol exposure in early gestation can cause changes in DNA methylation, gene expression, and brain structure of offspring. Furthermore, the results support our hypothesis of early epigenetic origin of alcohol-induced disorders: changes in gene regulation may have already taken place in embryonic stem cells and therefore can be seen in different tissue types later in life."
https://openalex.org/W1604278147,"Phytochromes are dimeric photoreceptor proteins that sense red light levels in plants, fungi, and bacteria. The proteins are structurally divided into a light-sensing photosensory module consisting of PAS, GAF, and PHY domains and a signaling output module, which in bacteriophytochromes typically is a histidine kinase (HK) domain. Existing structural data suggest that two dimerization interfaces exist between the GAF and HK domains, but their functional roles remain unclear. Using mutational, biochemical, and computational analyses of the Deinococcus radiodurans phytochrome, we demonstrate that two dimerization interfaces between sister GAF and HK domains stabilize the dimer with approximately equal contributions. The existence of both dimerization interfaces is critical for thermal reversion back to the resting state. We also find that a mutant in which the interactions between the GAF domains were removed monomerizes under red light. This implies that the interactions between the HK domains are significantly altered by photoconversion. The results suggest functional importance of the dimerization interfaces in bacteriophytochromes."

Both adenovirus-mediated overexpression of IGF2 and treatment of adult wild-type islets with recombinant IGF2 in vitro further confirmed the direct implication of IGF2 on β-cell dysfunction. Treatment of Tg-IGF2 mice with subdiabetogenic doses of streptozotocin or crossing these mice with a transgenic model of islet lymphocytic infiltration promoted the development of overt diabetes, suggesting that IGF2 makes islets more susceptible to β-cell damage and immune attack.

https://openalex.org/W1560126339,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is an etiologic agent of community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia. It has been shown that K. pneumoniae infections are characterized by reduced early inflammatory response. Recently our group has shown that K. pneumoniae dampens the activation of inflammatory responses by antagonizing the activation of the NF-κB canonical pathway. Our results revealed that K. pneumoniae capsule polysaccharide (CPS) was necessary but not sufficient to attenuate inflammation. To identify additional Klebsiella factors required to dampen inflammation, we standardized and applied a high-throughput gain-of-function screen to examine a Klebsiella transposon mutant library. We identified 114 mutants that triggered the activation of NF-κB. Two gene ontology categories accounted for half of the loci identified in the screening: metabolism and transport genes (32% of the mutants) and envelope-related genes (17%). Characterization of the mutants revealed that the lack of the enterobactin siderophore was linked to a reduced CPS expression, which in turn underlined the NF-κB activation induced by the mutant. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-polysaccharide and the pullulanase (PulA) type 2 secretion system (T2SS) are required for full effectiveness of the immune evasion. Importantly, these factors do not play a redundant role. The fact that LPS O-polysaccharide and T2SS mutant-induced responses were dependent on TLR2-TLR4-MyD88 activation suggested that LPS O-polysaccharide and PulA perturbed Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent recognition of K. pneumoniae. Finally, we demonstrate that LPS O-polysaccharide and pulA mutants are attenuated in the pneumonia mouse model. We propose that LPS O-polysaccharide and PulA T2SS could be new targets for the design of new antimicrobials.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative pathogen causing a wide range of infections from urinary tract infections to pneumonia. Klebsiella-triggered pneumonia is particularly devastating among immunocompromised patients with mortality rates between 25 and 60% (1Sahly H. Podschun R. Clinical, bacteriological, and serological aspects of Klebsiella infections and their spondylarthropathic sequelae.Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1997; 4: 393-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

This is dependent on Klebsiella-triggered Rho GTPase Rac1 inhibition (22Regueiro V. Moranta D. Frank C.G. Larrarte E. Margareto J. March C. Garmendia J. Bengoechea J.A. Klebsiella pneumoniae subverts the activation of inflammatory responses in a NOD1-dependent manner.Cell. Microbiol. 2011; 13: 135-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To identify additional host factors involved in the anti-inflammatory effect, we applied an unbiased high-throughput siRNA gain-of-function screen to interrogate the human kinome (24Frank C.G.

Microbiol. 2013; 15: 1212-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Follow-up validation revealed that K. pneumoniae exploits an EGF receptor (EGFR)-PI3K-AKT-PAK4-ERK-GSK3β signaling pathway to induce the expression of the deubiquitinase CYLD to attenuate the cytokine-dependent nuclear translocation of NF-κB (24Frank C.G.

Margareto J. March C. Garmendia J. Bengoechea J.A. Klebsiella pneumoniae subverts the activation of inflammatory responses in a NOD1-dependent manner.Cell. Microbiol. 2011; 13: 135-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), K. pneumoniae may employ additional factors to attenuate NF-κB activation. This study was designed to identify K. pneumoniae determinants implicated in blocking the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. To take a systematic approach toward the identification of these bacterial factors, we performed a high-throughput genetic screen to mine a transposon mutant library of K. pneumonia strain 52145. This is a reference strain of serotype K2 highly virulent Klebsiella strains from which important virulence factors, including the large virulence plasmid harboring the regulator of mucoid phenotype (rmpA) and the aerobactin cluster, have been identified (27Lery L.M.

We found 114 mutants that, in sharp contrast to the wild-type strain, activated the NF-κB signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2414430735,"The identity of calcium channels in the thyroid is unclear. In human follicular thyroid ML-1 cancer cells, sphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), through S1P receptors 1 and 3 (S1P1/S1P3), and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) stimulates migration. We show that human thyroid cells express several forms of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels, including TRPC1. In TRPC1 knockdown (TRPC1-KD) ML-1 cells, the basal and S1P-evoked invasion and migration was attenuated. Furthermore, the expression of S1P3 and VEGFR2 was significantly down-regulated. Transfecting wild-type ML-1 cells with a nonconducting TRPC1 mutant decreased S1P3 and VEGFR2 expression. In TRPC1-KD cells, receptor-operated calcium entry was decreased. To investigate whether the decreased receptor expression was due to attenuated calcium entry, cells were incubated with the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid). In these cells, and in cells where calmodulin and calmodulin-dependent kinase were blocked pharmacologically, S1P3 and VEGFR2 expression was decreased. In TRPC1-KD cells, both hypoxia-inducible factor 1α expression and the secretion and activity of MMP2 and MMP9 were attenuated, and proliferation was decreased in TRPC1-KD cells. This was due to a prolonged G1 phase of the cell cycle, a significant increase in the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27, and a decrease in the expression of cyclin D2, cyclin D3, and CDK6. Transfecting TRPC1 to TRPC1-KD cells rescued receptor expression, migration, and proliferation. Thus, the expression of S1P3 and VEGFR2 is mediated by a calcium-dependent mechanism. TRPC1 has a crucial role in this process. This regulation is important for the invasion, migration, and proliferation of thyroid cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W391137112,"The searching of human housekeeping (HK) genes has been a long quest since the emergence of transcriptomics, and is instrumental for us to understand the structure of genome and the fundamentals of biological processes. The resolved genes are frequently used in evolution studies and as normalization standards in quantitative gene-expression analysis. Within the past 20 years, more than a dozen HK-gene studies have been conducted, yet none of them sampled human tissues completely. We believe an integration of these results will help remove false positive genes owing to the inadequate sampling. Surprisingly, we only find one common gene across 15 examined HK-gene datasets comprising 187 different tissue and cell types. Our subsequent analyses suggest that it might not be appropriate to rigidly define HK genes as expressed in all tissue types that have diverse developmental, physiological, and pathological states. It might be beneficial to use more robustly identified HK functions for filtering criteria, in which the representing genes can be a subset of genome. These genes are not necessarily the same, and perhaps need not to be the same, everywhere in our body."

https://openalex.org/W413408830,"Animals use a variety of escape mechanisms to increase the probability of surviving predatory attacks. Antipredator defenses can be elaborate, making their evolutionary origin unclear. Trap-jaw ants are known for their rapid and powerful predatory mandible strikes, and some species have been observed to direct those strikes at the substrate, thereby launching themselves into the air away from a potential threat. This potential escape mechanism has never been examined in a natural context. We studied the use of mandible-powered jumping in Odontomachus brunneus during their interactions with a common ant predator: pit-building antlions. We observed that while trap-jaw ant workers escaped from antlion pits by running in about half of interactions, in 15% of interactions they escaped by mandible-powered jumping. To test whether escape jumps improved individual survival, we experimentally prevented workers from jumping and measured their escape rate. Workers with unrestrained mandibles escaped from antlion pits significantly more frequently than workers with restrained mandibles. Our results indicate that some trap-jaw ant species can use mandible-powered jumps to escape from common predators. These results also provide a charismatic example of evolutionary co-option, where a trait that evolved for one function (predation) has been co-opted for another (defense)."
https://openalex.org/W349786755,"The objective of this case-control study was to investigate the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) following non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). A total of 10,763 new AS patients were identified from the National Taiwan Health Insurance claims database during the period from 1997 to 2008. In all, 421 AS patients with CVD were recruited as cases, and up to 2-fold as many sex- and age-matched controls were selected. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) between NSAID use and CVD incidence. The medication possession rate (MPR) was used to evaluate NSAID exposure during the study period. AS patients had increased risk of CVD (OR, 1.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.57 to 1.80). Among frequent (MPR≥80%) COX II users, the risks for all types of CVD were ten times lower than those among non-users at 24 months (OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.92). Among frequent NSAID users, the risks of major adverse cardiac event (MACE) were significantly lower at 12 months (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.76)--a trend showing that longer exposure correlated with lower risk. Regarding non-frequent NSAID users (MPR<80%), short-term exposure did carry higher risk (for 6 months: OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.86), but after 12 months, the risk no longer existed. We conclude that long-term frequent use of NSAIDs might protect AS patients from CVD; however, NSAIDs still carried higher short-term risk in the non-frequent users."
https://openalex.org/W2335752517,"Aim The primary aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) and Neuro-Sensory Motor Developmental Assessment (NSMDA) over the first year of life for predicting motor impairment at 4 years in preterm children. The secondary aims were to assess the predictive value of serial assessments over the first year and when using a combination of these two assessment tools in follow-up. Method Children born <30 weeks’ gestation were prospectively recruited and assessed at 4, 8 and 12 months’ corrected age using the AIMS and NSMDA. At 4 years’ corrected age children were assessed for cerebral palsy (CP) and motor impairment using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2nd-edition (MABC-2). We calculated accuracy of the AIMS and NSMDA for predicting CP and MABC-2 scores ≤15th (at-risk of motor difficulty) and ≤5th centile (significant motor difficulty) for each test (AIMS and NSMDA) at 4, 8 and 12 months, for delay on one, two or all three of the time points over the first year, and finally for delay on both tests at each time point. Results Accuracy for predicting motor impairment was good for each test at each age, although false positives were common. Motor impairment on the MABC-2 (scores ≤5th and ≤15th) was most accurately predicted by the AIMS at 4 months, whereas CP was most accurately predicted by the NSMDA at 12 months. In regards to serial assessments, the likelihood ratio for motor impairment increased with the number of delayed assessments. When combining both the NSMDA and AIMS the best accuracy was achieved at 4 months, although results were similar at 8 and 12 months. Interpretation Motor development during the first year of life in preterm infants assessed with the AIMS and NSMDA is predictive of later motor impairment at preschool age. However, false positives are common and therefore it is beneficial to follow-up children at high risk of motor impairment at more than one time point, or to use a combination of assessment tools.

The activation was dependent on the glycerol backbone of the lysophospholipid and increased with acyl chain length, whereas the headgroup had little effect on activation. Activation of the plant pump by lysophospholipids did not involve the penultimate residue, Thr-947, which is known to be phosphorylated as part of a binding site for activating 14-3-3 protein, but was critically dependent on a single autoinhibitory residue (Leu-919) upstream of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain in AHA2. A corresponding residue is absent in the fungal counterpart.

H+-ATPases of fungi and plants generate the electrochemical proton-motive force across the PM that energizes the secondary active transport of nutrients across the membrane (1Palmgren M.G. Plant plasma membrane H+-ATPases: powerhouses for nutrient uptake.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 817-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). PM H+-ATPases belong to a large family of ion transport proteins termed P-type ATPases, which include ion pumps, such as animal Na+/K+-ATPases and Ca2+-ATPases (2Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. Evolution of substrate specificities in the P-type ATPase superfamily.J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 3Palmgren M.G. Nissen P. P-type ATPases.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2011; 40: 243-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Common features of the catalytic machinery of P-type ATPases are a transmembrane ion-binding domain and three cytoplasmic domains, including a phosphorylation domain, a nucleotide-binding domain, and an actuator domain. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of a conserved aspartate residue within the phosphorylation domain trigger movements of the cytoplasmic domains that are coupled with the opening and closing of discrete ion-binding sites within the membrane and ion translocation across the membrane. plasma membrane sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase lysophosphatidylcholine hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol 1-dodecanoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine 1-tetradecanoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine 1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside adenylyl 5′-(β,γ-methylene)diphosphonate. The activities of many P-type ATPases are tightly regulated by accessory inhibitory proteins or alternatively cis-acting autoinhibitory domains. For instance, the P2A sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) is inhibited by the accessory proteins phospholamban and sarcolipin, small membrane proteins with a single transmembrane segment (4Traaseth N.J. Shi L. Verardi R. Mullen D.G. Barany G. Veglia G. Structure and topology of monomeric phospholamban in lipid membranes determined by a hybrid solution and solid-state NMR approach.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 10165-10170Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Sarcolipin uncouples the SERCA pump (5Sahoo S.K. Shaikh S.A. Sopariwala D.H. Bal N.C. Periasamy M.

Autoinhibition by a regulatory domain is observed in a closely related family of P-type ATPases, the P2B calmodulin-activated Ca2+-ATPases, which occur in both plants and animals (8Geisler M.

The plasma membrane calcium pump in health and disease.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 5385-5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These ATPases possess an autoinhibitory domain that interacts with calmodulin to relieve autoinhibition. In yeast and plant PM H+-ATPases, pump activation by loss of autoinhibition is induced by distinct extracellular stimuli, such as changes in carbon source availability (11Serrano R.

In plant PM H+-ATPases, both the N and C termini constitute autoinhibitory domains, but the C-terminal regulatory domain is more extensive (16Palmgren M.G. Sommarin M. Serrano R. Larsson C.

Activation following neutralization of this domain causes a change in the coupling ratio of the pump with a large increase in proton pumping and a small increase in ATP hydrolytic activity (13Kinoshita T.

Modified plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase with improved transport coupling efficiency identified by mutant selection in yeast.Plant J. 1996; 10: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activated pump has an increased Vmax, an increased affinity for ATP, and a shift in pH optimum from slightly acidic to neutral, which suggests an increased apparent H+ affinity (20Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. C-terminal deletion analysis of plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase: yeast as a model system for solute transport across the plant plasma membrane.Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1655-1666PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of the PM H+-ATPase AHA2 from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is divided into two assumed autoinhibitory segments of predicted α-helical nature denoted as Region I between ∼80 and 60 residues from the terminus and Region II between ∼50 and 30 residues from the terminus (21Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G.

Studies of the related Nicotiana plumbaginifolia (tobacco) pump PMA2 confirmed this intricate organization of the C-terminal regulatory domain (22Speth C. Jaspert N. Marcon C. Oecking C. Regulation of the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase by its C-terminal domain: what do we know for sure?.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 89: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Transformation of the PM H+-ATPase molecule from the low to the high activity state in vivo is proposed to involve structural rearrangement of the terminal domains without the need for their actual separation from the rest of the protein. A well described mechanism for the in vivo activation of the PM H+-ATPase protein involves phosphorylation of the C-terminal threonine residue (Thr-947 in the penultimate position of AHA2), which allows for 14-3-3 binding (23Jahn T. Fuglsang A.T. Olsson A. Brüntrup I.M. Collinge D.B. Volkmann D. Sommarin M. Palmgren M.G. Larsson C.

Several additional phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal domain have been identified that either activate or inhibit the enzyme independently of 14-3-3 binding (26Rudashevskaya E.L. Ye J.

The structure of a C-terminal truncated form of Arabidopsis AHA2 has been solved to 3.6 Å (27Pedersen B.P. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Morth J.P. Palmgren M.G. Nissen P.

Phospholipids are important regulators of P-type ATPases. PM Ca2+-ATPases are strongly activated by acidic phospholipids (29Niggli V. Adunyah E.S. Carafoli E.

Lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) is a detergent-like molecule produced from cleavage of phosphatidylcholine by the enzyme phospholipase A2 and has been proposed to serve as a signaling molecule in plants (37Laxalt A.M.

Bot. 2008; 59: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Plant PM H+-ATPase is strongly activated by micromolar concentrations of lyso-PC, which cannot be explained by the unmasking of latent ATP-binding sites alone (40Palmgren M.G. Sommarin M. Ulvskov P. Jorgensen P.L. Modulation of plasma membrane H+-ATPase from oat roots by lysophosphatidylcholine, free fatty acids and phospholipase A2.Physiol.

Lysophosphatidylcholine stimulates ATP dependent proton accumulation in isolated oat root plasma membrane vesicles.Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, the specificity and mechanism of activation are unknown. A long term goal of our research is to determine the full-length structure of PM H+-ATPase in its autoinhibited state. To purify membrane protein for crystallization trials, it is essential to solubilize the protein from its native membrane using detergents. During this work, we observed a partial activation of the plant PM H+-ATPase by some detergents but none that was as strong and with such a clear threshold as lysophospholipids. Strikingly, lysophospholipids had no effect on a fungal counterpart of the plant pump, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pma1p. The effect of lysophospholipids on the plant pump was direct as it did not involve phosphorylation of Thr-947 and was completely abolished by substitution of a single hydrophobic residue in the C terminus of the pump. The identification of the plant PM H+-ATPase as a lysophospholipid sensor supports the hypothesis that signaling lipids are involved in regulating PM electrochemical gradients in plants.

Yeast plasma membranes were isolated as described (11Serrano R. In vivo glucose activation of the yeast plasma membrane ATPase.FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to standard techniques. Membranes were diluted to 10 mg/ml in a buffer (G20MKED) containing 20% glycerol, 50 mm MES-KOH (pH 6.5), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and mixed with an equal volume of G20MKED with typically 3% detergent, corresponding to a 3:1 mass ratio of detergent to protein.

To determine ATP kinetics, ATP concentrations were varied between 0.085 and 3 mm. Lysophospholipids were assayed at concentrations ranging from 3 to 800 μm. To evaluate the effect of DDM and lyso-PCs on ATP kinetics, the protein was preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and with or without 1.5% DDM as described above. Then 0 or 25 μm lyso-PC 16:0 (final concentration) was added directly before the start of the assay, and the same ATP concentrations as above were used.

All figures were generated using GraphPad Prism® 6.0 and analyzed using non-linear regression Michaelis-Menten kinetic tools. The standard errors are calculated as S.E. For structural studies of full-length PM H+-ATPases with correct positioning of autoinhibitory domains, it is essential that the low affinity state of the pump be preserved during protein purification. An important step in membrane protein purification is solubilization with detergents. We therefore tested whether the solubilization procedure as such affected the activation parameters of the PM H+-ATPase AHA2. To identify detergents that do not influence the activity state of AHA2, we evaluated the effect of various detergents on the activation and solubilization state of AHA2. Eighty detergents were tested, and of those, 19 were able to solubilize AHA2 without denaturing it (data not shown). All solubilizing detergents were found to increase both Vmax and ATP affinity (i.e. lowered the Km for ATP) of AHA2. Among the 19 solubilizing detergents, 18 had a relatively modest effect on the ATPase activity of AHA2 (as exemplified by DDM in Table 1 and Fig. 1, A and B), whereas lyso-PC stood out as having a potent effect with a marked threshold level (Table 1 and Fig. 1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for the plasma membrane H+-ATPase AHA2 and derived deletion mutants measured at 30 °C in the presence and absence of DDM and lyso-PC, respectively"

We analyzed the effects of temperature anomaly on arrival date and infestation severity of potato leafhopper, Empoasca fabae Harris, a classic new world long distance migrant, and a significant pest in several agricultural crops. We compiled E. fabae arrival dates and infestation severity data at different states in USA from existing literature reviews and agricultural extension records from 1951-2012, and examined the influence of temperature anomalies at each target state or overwintering range on the date of arrival and severity of infestation. Average E. fabae arrival date at different states reveal a clear trend along the south-north axis, with earliest arrival closest to the overwintering range. E. fabae arrival has advanced by 10 days over the last 62 years. E. fabae arrived earlier in warmer years in relation to each target state level temperature anomaly (3.0 days / °C increase in temperature anomaly). Increased temperature had a significant and positive effect on the severity of infestation, and arrival date had a marginal negative effect on severity. These relationships suggest that continued warming could advance the time of E. fabae colonization and increase their impact on affected crops."

Here, we demonstrate that the Sen complex cleaves the mitochondria-localized mRNA encoding Cbp1 (cytochrome b mRNA processing 1). Endonucleolytic cleavage of this mRNA required two cis-elements: the mitochondrial targeting signal and the stem-loop 652–726-nt region. Mitochondrial localization of the Sen complex was required for cleavage of the CBP1 mRNA, and the Sen complex cleaved this mRNA directly in vitro. We propose that the Sen complex cleaves the CBP1 mRNA, which is co-translationally localized to mitochondria via its mitochondrial targeting signal."
https://openalex.org/W1499916869,"The adverse impact of antibiotics on the gut microbiota has attracted extensive interest, particularly due to the development of microbiome research techniques in recent years. However, a direct comparison of the dynamic effects of various types of antibiotics using the same animal model has not been available. In the present study, we selected six antibiotics from four categories with the broadest clinical usage, namely, β-lactams (Ceftriaxone Sodium, Cefoperazone/Sulbactam and meropenem), quinolones (ofloxacin), glycopeptides (vancomycin), and macrolides (azithromycin), to treat BALB/c mice. Stool samples were collected during and after the administration of antibiotics, and microbial diversity was analyzed through Illumina sequencing and bioinformatics analyses using QIIME. Both α and β diversity analyses showed that ceftriaxone sodium, cefoperazone/sulbactam, meropenem and vancomycin changed the gut microbiota dramatically by the second day of antibiotic administration whereas the influence of ofloxacin was trivial. Azithromycin clearly changed the gut microbiota but much less than vancomycin and the β-lactams. In general, the community changes induced by the three β-lactam antibiotics showed consistency in inhibiting Papillibacter, Prevotella and Alistipes while inducing massive growth of Clostridium. The low diversity and high Clostridium level might be an important cause of Clostridium difficile infection after usage of β-lactams. Vancomycin was unique in that it inhibited Firmicutes, mainly the genus Clostridium. On the other hand, it induced the growth of Escherichia and effect lasted for months afterward. Azithromycin and meropenem induced the growth of Enterococcus. These findings will be useful for understanding the potential adverse effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiome and ensuring their better usage."

https://openalex.org/W332660750,"Genetic factors are thought to play a major role in the etiology of essential tremor (ET); however, few genetic changes that induce ET have been identified to date. In the present study, to find genes responsible for the development of ET, we employed a rat model system consisting of a tremulous mutant strain, TRM/Kyo (TRM), and its substrain TRMR/Kyo (TRMR). The TRM rat is homozygous for the tremor (tm) mutation and shows spontaneous tremors resembling human ET. The TRMR rat also carries a homozygous tm mutation but shows no tremor, leading us to hypothesize that TRM rats carry one or more genes implicated in the development of ET in addition to the tm mutation. We used a positional cloning approach and found a missense mutation (c. 1061 C>T, p. A354V) in the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 1 channel (Hcn1) gene. The A354V HCN1 failed to conduct hyperpolarization-activated currents in vitro, implicating it as a loss-of-function mutation. Blocking HCN1 channels with ZD7288 in vivo evoked kinetic tremors in nontremulous TRMR rats. We also found neuronal activation of the inferior olive (IO) in both ZD7288-treated TRMR and non-treated TRM rats and a reduced incidence of tremor in the IO-lesioned TRM rats, suggesting a critical role of the IO in tremorgenesis. A rat strain carrying the A354V mutation alone on a genetic background identical to that of the TRM rats showed no tremor. Together, these data indicate that body tremors emerge when the two mutant loci, tm and Hcn1A354V, are combined in a rat model of ET. In this model, HCN1 channels play an important role in the tremorgenesis of ET. We propose that oligogenic, most probably digenic, inheritance is responsible for the genetic heterogeneity of ET."
https://openalex.org/W1513203770,"Metabotropic (slow) and ionotropic (fast) neurotransmission are integrated by intracellular signal transduction mechanisms involving protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation to achieve experience-dependent alterations in brain circuitry. ERK is an important effector of both slow and fast forms of neurotransmission and has been implicated in normal brain function and CNS diseases. Here we characterize phosphorylation of the ERK-activating protein kinase MEK1 by Cdk5, ERK, and Cdk1 in vitro in intact mouse brain tissue and in the context of an animal behavioral paradigm of stress. Cdk5 only phosphorylates Thr-292, whereas ERK and Cdk1 phosphorylate both Thr-292 and Thr-286 MEK1. These sites interact in a kinase-specific manner and inhibit the ability of MEK1 to activate ERK. Thr-292 and Thr-286 MEK1 are phosphorylated in most mouse brain regions to stoichiometries of ~5% or less. Phosphorylation of Thr-292 MEK1 is regulated by cAMP-dependent signaling in mouse striatum in a manner consistent with negative feedback inhibition in response to ERK activation. Protein phosphatase 1 and 2A contribute to the maintenance of the basal phosphorylation state of both Thr-292 and Thr-286 MEK1 and that of ERK. Activation of the NMDA class of ionotropic glutamate receptors reduces inhibitory MEK1 phosphorylation, whereas forced swim, a paradigm of acute stress, attenuates Thr-292 MEK1 phosphorylation. Together, the data indicate that these inhibitory MEK1 sites phosphorylated by Cdk5 and ERK1 serve as mechanistic points of convergence for the regulation of ERK signaling by both slow and fast neurotransmission."

Here, we expressed recombinant hSMVT in Pichia pastoris and used affinity chromatography to purify the detergent-solubilized protein followed by reconstitution of hSMVT in lipid bilayers. Using a combined approach encompassing radiolabeled LA transport and equilibrium binding studies in conjunction with the stabilized R-(+)- and S-(−)-enantiomers and the R,S-(+/−) racemic mixture of LA or lipoamide, we identified the biologically active form of LA, R-LA, to be the physiological substrate of hSMVT.

https://openalex.org/W363945232,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system for protein degradation plays a major role in regulating cell function and many signaling proteins are tightly controlled by this mechanism. Among these, Regulator of G Protein Signaling 2 (RGS2) is a target for rapid proteasomal degradation, however, the specific enzymes involved are not known. Using a genomic siRNA screening approach, we identified a novel E3 ligase complex containing cullin 4B (CUL4B), DNA damage binding protein 1 (DDB1) and F-box protein 44 (FBXO44) that mediates RGS2 protein degradation. While the more typical F-box partners CUL1 and Skp1 can bind FBXO44, that E3 ligase complex does not bind RGS2 and is not involved in RGS2 degradation. These observations define an unexpected DDB1/CUL4B-containing FBXO44 E3 ligase complex. Pharmacological targeting of this mechanism provides a novel therapeutic approach to hypertension, anxiety, and other diseases associated with RGS2 dysregulation."

The 14-3-3 proteins are highly conserved dimeric molecules that recognize specific phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-containing motifs.

The structural analysis of the Pdc·Gtβγ complex revealed that Pdc consists of two separate domains that are both involved in binding to Gtβγ (Fig. 1A) (13Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B.

Cell. 1999; 3: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Whereas the mostly helical N-terminal domain (Pdc-ND) constitutes the main part of Pdc's interaction surface with Gtβγ (∼65% of the total binding surface) and is responsible for competing with Gtα for Gtβγ, the C-terminal domain (Pdc-CD) possesses the thioredoxin-like fold and seems to be responsible for blocking the interaction of Gtβγ with the membrane. These structural studies also suggested that Pdc-ND is highly flexible, especially in regions where it does not contact Gtβγ, and in its free state it lacks an explicit native conformation in contrast to the helical conformation observed in the complex with Gtβγ. Phosphorylation sites Ser54 and Ser73, which control the binding of Pdc to Gtβγ, are both located within Pdc-ND, and it has been shown that their simultaneous phosphorylation is required for a stable complex formation between phosphorylated Pdc (pPdc) and the 14-3-3ζ protein (15Rezabkova L. Kacirova M. Sulc M. Herman P. Vecer J. Stepanek M. Obsilova V. Obsil T. Structural modulation of phosducin by phosphorylation and 14-3-3 protein binding.Biophys. J. 2012; 103: 1960-1969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This suggested that phosphorylation of Ser54 and Ser73 creates two 14-3-3-binding motifs that are used simultaneously to engage both ligand binding grooves within the 14-3-3ζ protein dimer. The presence of both 14-3-3-binding motifs within Pdc-ND also indicates that this domain constitutes the main part of Pdc's interaction surface with the 14-3-3 protein, which might either sterically block the Pdc's Gtβγ-binding surface and/or change its structure. We have recently shown, using time-resolved dansyl fluorescence spectroscopy, that the 14-3-3ζ protein binding reduces the segmental dynamics within several regions of the dansyl-labeled pPdc molecule, suggesting that pPdc undergoes a conformational change upon binding to 14-3-3ζ (15Rezabkova L.

These changes involve parts of the Gtβγ binding surface of Pdc-ND, thus supporting the inhibitory role of the 14-3-3 protein in Pdc binding to Gtβγ. In addition, it has also been speculated that the 14-3-3 protein binding decreases the rate of Pdc dephosphorylation after a light stimulus by virtue of its interaction with phosphorylated Ser54 and Ser73, thus lengthening the time that Pdc remains phosphorylated after a light exposure and/or stabilizes the N-terminal domain and protects phosphorylated Pdc from degradation (9Thulin C.D.

Yet another role for the 14-3-3 protein binding might be in the regulation of Pdc interaction with other proteins, including the SUG1 subunit of the proteasome complex and the transcription factor CRX (3Zhu X.

More detailed structural data on Pdc, of which the unbound (apo) structure is unknown, and its complex with the 14-3-3 protein are clearly needed to better understand the role of 14-3-3 in the regulation of Pdc function. Here, we use small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, quenching of tryptophan fluorescence, hydrogen-deuterium exchange kinetics coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), and other biophysical approaches to investigate the solution structure of apo Pdc and its interaction with the 14-3-3ζ protein.

The CD measurements were conducted at 22 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol with protein concentrations of 10 μm (far-UV spectra) and 80–160 μm (near-UV spectra). Sedimentation velocity (SV) experiments were performed using a ProteomeLabTM XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) as described previously (19Kosek D. Kylarova S. Psenakova K.

Samples were dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol before analysis. All sedimentation profiles were recorded with absorption optics. The diffusion-deconvoluted sedimentation coefficient distributions c(s) were calculated from raw absorbance data using the software package SEDFIT (20Schuck P.

SV analysis of interaction between full-length pPdc (pPdc-ND and Pdc-CD) and 14-3-3ζΔC was performed at various loading concentrations and molar ratios; this was followed by the integration of calculated distributions to determine the overall weight-averaged s values (sw). Constructed sw isotherms were fitted with A + B ⇌ AB model as implemented in the software package SEDPHAT with known sw values of individual components as prior knowledge. Resulting parameters were verified, and loading concentrations were corrected using the global Lamm equation modeling also implemented in the SEDPHAT software (20Schuck P.

SAXS data were collected on the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) P12 beamline on the storage ring PETRA III (Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany). The SAXS measurements were conducted in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The Pdc concentrations were 2.3, 3.4, and 4.2 mg·ml−1. The data were averaged, and the scattering of buffer was subtracted using PRIMUS (22Roessle M.W. Klaering R. Ristau U. Robrahn B. Jahn D. Gehrmann T. Konarev P. Round A. Fiedler S. Hermes C.

Crystallogr. 2007; 40: S190-S194Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The forward scattering I(0) and the radius of gyration Rg were calculated using the Guinier approximation (23Guinier A. La diffraction des rayons X aux très faibles angles: Applications à l'etude des phénomènes ultra-microscopies.Ann. Phys. 1939; 12: 161-237Crossref Google Scholar). The distance distribution functions P(r) and the maximum particle dimensions Dmax were computed from the entire scattering pattern using the program GNOM (24Svergun D.I. Determination of the regularization parameter in indirect-transform methods using perceptual criteria.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). The solute apparent molecular mass (MMexp) was estimated by comparison of the forward scattering with that from reference solutions of bovine serum albumin (molecular mass 66 kDa). Ab initio molecular envelopes were computed by the program DAMMIN (25Svergun D.I. Restoring low resolution structure of biological macromolecules from solution scattering using simulated annealing.Biophys.

Uniqueness of ab initio shape determination in small-angle scattering.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). The analysis based on the ensemble optimization method was performed using the program EOM (27Bernadó P. Mylonas E. Petoukhov M.V. Blackledge M. Svergun D.I.

Fluorescence decays were measured on an apparatus described previously (28Vecer J. Vesela P. Malinsky J. Herman P. Sphingolipid levels crucially modulate lateral microdomain organization of plasma membrane in living yeast.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The apparatus included frequency-tripled Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent, Chameleon Ultra II) and the time-correlated single photon counting detection (Becker&Hickl, SPC150) with cooled MCP-PMT (Hamamatsu, R3809U-50). Tryptophan was excited at 298 nm, and its emission was collected at 355 nm using a monochromator (Horiba, H-20) with a stack of UG1 and BG40 glass filters placed in front of the input slit. ANS emission was excited and measured at 355 and 480 nm, respectively, using the monochromator with the 405-nm long-pass filter in the emission channel. Decays were accumulated under the magic angle conditions, typically in 1024 channels and a time resolution of 50 ps/channel, until 107 counts per decay were reached. Samples were placed in a thermostatic holder, and all experiments were performed at 23 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The Pdc concentration was 30 μm, and the 14-3-3ζnoW protein concentration was 60 μm. ANS fluorescence experiments were performed with 5 μm Pdc and 20 μm ANS. Fluorescence was assumed to decay multiexponentially according to Equation 1, l(t)=∑iαi⋅exp(−t/τi)(Eq. 1) where 32 Σi αi = 1 and τi and αi are the fluorescence lifetimes and the corresponding amplitudes, respectively. Decays were analyzed by a singular value decomposition maximum entropy method for oversampled data (29Vecer J. Herman P. Maximum entropy analysis of analytically simulated complex fluorescence decays.J. Fluoresc. 2011; 21: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The program yields amplitudes, αi, representing lifetime distributions. Typically, we used 100 lifetimes equidistantly spaced in the logarithmic scale, ranging from 50 ps to 100 ns. The mean fluorescence lifetime of the whole decay was calculated from Equation 2, τmean=∑iαiτi2/∑iαiτi(Eq. 2) Polarized fluorescence decays were measured with fixed emission polarizer set in the vertical position, and the excitation polarization plane was rotated between 0 and 90°. In this configuration the G-factor was close to one, and its value was determined in an independent experiment. Fluorescence anisotropy decays r(t) were obtained by simultaneous reconvolution of parallel I‖(t) and perpendicular I⊥(t) decay components (30Cross A.J. Fleming G.R. Analysis of time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decays.Biophys. J. 1984; 46: 45-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 31Gilbert C.W. Cundall R.B. Dale R.E.

Plenum Press, New York1983: 605-606Google Scholar) using model-independent singular value decomposition maximum entropy method that does not set prior limits on the distribution shape (29Vecer J. Herman P. Maximum entropy analysis of analytically simulated complex fluorescence decays.J. Fluoresc. 2011; 21: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The anisotropies r(t) were assumed to decay multiexponentially as shown in Equation 3, r(t)=∑iβ′i⋅exp(−t/ϕ′i)(Eq. 3) where amplitudes β′i represent a distribution of the correlation times φ′I (Σβ′i = r0), and r0 is the initial anisotropy. We used 100 correlation times φ′i equidistantly spaced in the logarithmic scale and ranging from 50 ps to 200 ns. For multimodal distributions, the mean correlation time associated with the m-th peak of the distribution was calculated from Equation 4, ϕm=∑kβ′m,k⋅ϕ′m.k/∑kβ′m,k(Eq. 4) where index k runs over the nonzero amplitudes of the m-th peak of the distribution only. The area of the peak represents the associated mean amplitude βm. Fluorescence quenching measurements were performed at 22 °C on an ISS PC1 photon counting spectrofluorometer, using a 1-nm bandpass on both the excitation and emission monochromators. Samples (35 μm pPdc and 70 μm 14-3-3ζnoW) were dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Stern-Volmer plots were constructed using the changes in fluorescence intensity at 340 nm (with excitation at 297 nm) and fitted with Equation 5, l0/l=(1+KSV[Q])eV[Q](Eq. 5) where I0 is the fluorescence intensity in the absence of the quencher; I is the fluorescence intensity of the sample in the presence of the quencher with the concentration [Q]; KSV is the Stern-Volmer constant, and V is the static quenching constant. The KSV is equal to τmean kq, where kq is the bimolecular rate constant for quenching, and τmean is a mean fluorescence lifetime of the tryptophan in the absence of a quencher (32Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Exposure of tryptophanyl residues in proteins–quantitative-determination by fluorescence quenching studies.Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Corrections for the inner filter effect were performed as described previously according Equation 6 (33Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy.2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 53-55Google Scholar), lc=l antilog((Aex+Aem)/2)(Eq. 6) where IC is the corrected fluorescence intensity; I is the measured fluorescence intensity, and Aex and Aem are sample absorbances at the excitation and emission wavelength, respectively. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange was followed for individual proteins alone (Pdc, pPdc, and 14-3-3ζΔC) and for 2:1 molar mixture of 14-3-3ζΔC:pPdc. Concentrations of the proteins during exchange were 120 μm for 14-3-3ζΔC and 60 μm for Pdc or pPdc. HDX was started by a 5-fold dilution of the proteins to deuterated buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pD 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol), and aliquots of 10 μl were collected at 40 s, 4 and 15 min, and 1, 3, and 8 h of exchange. Exchange was stopped by the addition of 57 μl of 6 mm HCl and freezing in liquid nitrogen. Analysis of deuterated samples (HPLC-MS) and data processing were done as described elsewhere (34Trcka F. Durech M. Man P. Hernychova L. Muller P. Vojtesek B. The assembly and intermolecular properties of the Hsp70-Tomm34-Hsp90 molecular chaperone complex.J. Biol.

Injection volume was 20 μl and shorter gradient was used, 10–25% B (95% acetonitrile, 5% water, 0.4% formic acid) in 5 min, followed by a quick step to 40% B. The crystal structure of the Pdc·Gtβγ complex revealed that Pdc-ND includes the first 110 amino acid residues (Fig. 1A) and constitutes the main part of Pdc's interaction surface with Gtβγ (13Gaudet R.

https://openalex.org/W869022353,"The physiological and molecular mechanisms of age-related memory loss are complicated by the complexity of vertebrate nervous systems. This study takes advantage of a simple neural model to investigate nervous system aging, focusing on changes in learning and memory in the form of behavioral sensitization in vivo and synaptic facilitation in vitro. The effect of aging on the tail withdrawal reflex (TWR) was studied in Aplysia californica at maturity and late in the annual lifecycle. We found that short-term sensitization in TWR was absent in aged Aplysia. This implied that the neuronal machinery governing nonassociative learning was compromised during aging. Synaptic plasticity in the form of short-term facilitation between tail sensory and motor neurons decreased during aging whether the sensitizing stimulus was tail shock or the heterosynaptic modulator serotonin (5-HT). Together, these results suggest that the cellular mechanisms governing behavioral sensitization are compromised during aging, thereby nearly eliminating sensitization in aged Aplysia."

https://openalex.org/W2148372466,"There is an ongoing debate about the deployment rates and composition of alternative energy plans that could feasibly displace fossil fuels globally by mid-century, as required to avoid the more extreme impacts of climate change. Here we demonstrate the potential for a large-scale expansion of global nuclear power to replace fossil-fuel electricity production, based on empirical data from the Swedish and French light water reactor programs of the 1960s to 1990s. Analysis of these historical deployments show that if the world built nuclear power at no more than the per capita rate of these exemplar nations during their national expansion, then coal- and gas-fired electricity could be replaced worldwide in less than a decade. Under more conservative projections that take into account probable constraints and uncertainties such as differing relative economic output across regions, current and past unit construction time and costs, future electricity demand growth forecasts and the retiring of existing aging nuclear plants, our modelling estimates that the global share of fossil-fuel-derived electricity could be replaced within 25-34 years. This would allow the world to meet the most stringent greenhouse-gas mitigation targets."
https://openalex.org/W1480480693,"Central Asia is one of the most significant loess regions on Earth, with an important role in understanding Quaternary climate and environmental change. However, in contrast to the widely investigated loess deposits in the Chinese Loess Plateau, the Central Asian loess-paleosol sequences are still insufficiently known and poorly understood. Through field investigation and review of the previous literature, the authors have investigated the distribution, thickness and age of the Xinjiang loess, and analyzed factors that control these parameters in the Xinjiang in northwest China, Central Asia. The loess sediments cover river terraces, low uplands, the margins of deserts and the slopes of the Tianshan Mountains and Kunlun Mountains and are also present in the Ili Basin. The thickness of the Xinjiang loess deposits varies from several meters to 670 m. The variation trend of the sand fraction (>63 μm) grain-size contour can indicate the local major wind directions, so we conclude that the NW and NE winds are the main wind directions in the North and South Xinjiang, and the westerly wind mainly transport dust into the Ili basin. We consider persistent drying, adequate regional wind energy and well-developed river terraces to be the main factors controlling the distribution, thickness and formation age of the Xinjiang loess. The well-outcropped loess sections have mainly developed since the middle Pleistocene in Xinjiang, reflecting the appearance of the persistent drying and the present air circulation system. However, the oldest loess deposits are as old as the beginning of the Pliocene in the Tarim Basin, which suggests that earlier aridification occurred in the Tarim Basin rather than in the Ili Basin and the Junggar Basin."
https://openalex.org/W1527556383,"Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and other fluorescent proteins are essential tools for biological research. When fused to peptides or proteins as a reporter, GFP enables localization and quantitation of gene products in otherwise unmanipulated live cells or organisms. We previously reported that a sizable fraction of nascent GFP is post-translationally converted into a 20-kDa Triton X-100-insoluble proteasome substrate (Qian, S. B., Princiotta, M. F., Bennink, J. R., and Yewdell, J. W. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 392–400; Dolan, B. P., Li, L., Veltri, C. A., Ireland, C. M., Bennink, J. R., and Yewdell, J. W. (2011) J. Immunol. 186, 2065–2072). Here, we show that a similarly sized fragment is generated by all GFP and red fluorescent protein family members we examined. We demonstrate that fragmentation is a by-product of GFP chromophore rearrangement. A non-rearranging GFP mutant fails to fragment and generates diminished levels of Kb-SIINFEKL complexes when SIINFEKL is genetically fused to either the C- or N-terminal domains of GFP fusion proteins. Instructively, another fragmenting GFP mutant that cannot create the functional chromophore but still generates fragments also demonstrates diminished Kb-SIINFEKL generation. However, the mutant and wild-type fragments differ fundamentally in that wild-type fragments are rapidly liberated from the intact molecule and degraded quickly, accounting for increased Kb-SIINFEKL generation. In the fragmenting mutant, the fragments are generated slowly and remain associated, likely in a native conformation based on their original structural description (Barondeau, D. P., Kassmann, C. J., Tainer, J. A., and Getzoff, E. D. (2006) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 128, 4685–4693). The wild-type GFP fragments represent the first biochemically defined natural defective ribosomal products to contribute peptides for immunosurveillance, enabling quantitation of peptide generation efficiency from this source of defective ribosomal products. More broadly, given the wide use of fluorescent proteins, their ubiquitous and abundant fragmentation must be considered when interpreting experiments using these extremely useful probes.

GFP and other fluorescent proteins are widely considered to be highly stable in cells and are often treated as neutral reporter molecules for myriad biological studies, including those involving major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-based immunosurveillance. MHC class I molecules bind peptides of 8–12 residues in the endoplasmic reticulum and follow the standard secretory pathway to the cell surface, where the complex can be recognized by CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cell lysis of target cells and release of cytokines play an important role in immune recognition of viruses, other intracellular pathogens, tumor cells, transplanted tissues, and autoimmune targets. Class I peptides derive largely from proteins synthesized by the cells' own ribosomes. There are two general classes of substrates that provide peptides as follows: retirees and defective ribosomal products (DRiPs). Retirees are proteins degraded via the normal process of protein aging. Proteins generally demonstrate first-order degradation kinetics, with an average half-life of ∼24 h (2Poole B. Wibo M.

We conjured DRiPs to explain the extremely rapid generation of peptides from otherwise highly stable viral proteins. Originally, we defined DRiPs as prematurely terminated or misfolded full-length proteins produced from bona fide mRNA (which includes subunits of multi-protein assemblies that are produced in excess) (5Yewdell J.W.

Cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 at 37 °C in a balanced salt solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin.

To prepare whole cell lysates, harvested cells were washed in PBS and then resuspended to a concentration of 107 cells/ml in SDS extraction buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 15 units/ml DNase) containing protease inhibitor mixture (one cOmplete protease inhibitor mixture tablet from Roche Applied Science per 10 ml). Cells were incubated at 99 °C for 10 min. Cell lysates were mixed with 4× NuPAGE buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), resolved by 4–12% NuPAGE gels (Life Technologies, Inc.), and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies and respective infrared secondary antibodies and analyzed using the Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR). Cells were harvested at the indicated time points and washed with PBS. Kb-SIINFEKL levels on the cell surface were determined after incubating cells at 4 °C for 30 min with the AlexaFluor 647-conjugated 25D1.16 monoclonal antibody. To determine the protein level of vaccinia viral protein E3L in parallel, half of the harvested cells were fixed in 3.2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min, washed in PBS, incubated with antibody TW2.3 at 4 °C for 30 min, washed in PBS, and then stained with AlexaFluor 647 anti-mouse antibody at 4 °C for 30 min. All flow cytometry experiments were conducted using an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by Flowjo (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland OR). L-Kb cells were labeled at 37 °C for 5 min with [35S]Met (0.2 mCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in Met-deficient DMEM without prior Met starvation. Labeling was terminated by adding ice-cold PBS containing 67 mm Met. Immunoprecipitation was performed using protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, dried, exposed to phosphor screens overnight, and analyzed with a GE Typhoon Trio+ imager and ImageQuantTL software. Given the widespread use of fluorescent proteins in biology, it is important to understand their biogenesis and degradation. Whenever we have used GFP, or GFP genetically appended to the C termini of other proteins, we have detected an anti-GFP antibody-reactive species of ∼20 kDa (GFP20) in immunoblots of GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 1A, lane 1) (20Qian S.B. Princiotta M.F. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Characterization of rapidly degraded polypeptides in mammalian cells reveals a novel layer of nascent protein quality control.J. Biol.

Distinct pathways generate peptides from defective ribosomal products for CD8+ T cell immunosurveillance.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 2065-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Notably, a similarly sized fragment is also observed when GFP is synthesized in cell-free translation systems (26Sawasaki T. Hasegawa Y. Tsuchimochi M. Kamura N. Ogasawara T. Kuroita T. Endo Y. A bilayer cell-free protein synthesis system for high-throughput screening of gene products.FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is an intrinsic feature of GFP biogenesis. We first tested whether GFP20 is generated from related GFP variants expressed by HeLa cells from transfected genes (Fig. 1A). These include the following: 1) moxsynGFP, a monomerized human codon-optimized, superfolder GFP lacking cysteines (Fig. 1A, lane 2); 2) mGFP A206K, a monomerized GFP (Fig. 1A, lane 3); 3) Emerald, an eGFP derivative that folds more efficiently at 37 °C (Fig. 1A, lane 4); and 4) Venus, a yellow fluorescent protein (Fig. 1A, lane 5). For each of the GFPs tested, the anti-GFP antibodies detected both the full-length protein and an abundant species migrating similarly to GFP20. The specificity of detection is shown by the absence of these species in cells transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 1A, lane 6). Red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) are structurally highly similar to GFP but evolutionarily distinct (27Remington S.J. Fluorescent proteins: maturation, photochemistry and photophysics.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We tested lysates from L-Kb cells (L929 cells expressing the mouse class I molecule H-2Kb from a transgene) infected with rVVs expressing RFP variants appended to the C terminus of influenza A virus NP (Fig. 1B). The chimeric gene product NPStagRFP consists (N to C terminus) of influenza A virus NP, the Kb-binding peptide SIINFEKL, and tagRFP. rVVs encoding β-gal (negative control), or also expressing NPS-tagRFP, NPS-tagBFP, NPS-mCherry, and NPS-tdTomato, were tested (Fig. 1B). Immunoblotting using antibodies to either NP or RFP revealed that a significant fraction of each of the chimeric proteins was detected as an N-terminal fragment (anti-NP antibody) or a C-terminal fragment of ∼20 kDa (anti-RFP antibody) (Fig. 1B). Notably, the intensity of the N-terminal fragment was only moderately less than the full-length species (NPS-tagRFP and NPS-tagBFP) or even more abundant than the full-length species (NPS-mCherry and NPS-tdTomato). Thus, for the RFP variants, the fragmentation process is highly robust. Our results show that fragmentation is a ubiquitous feature for both GFP and RFP. As the amino acid sequences of RFPs and GFPs we used exhibit little similarity, it is unlikely that the fragments arise from site-specific proteolysis. Together with our previous finding that levels of the fragment are controlled by an N-terminal degron (22Dolan B.P. Li L. Veltri C.A. Ireland C.M. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Distinct pathways generate peptides from defective ribosomal products for CD8+ T cell immunosurveillance.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 2065-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we can safely rule out fragment biogenesis from downstream initiation. Because cell-free translation systems also generate the GFP fragment (26Sawasaki T. Hasegawa Y. Tsuchimochi M. Kamura N. Ogasawara T. Kuroita T. Endo Y. A bilayer cell-free protein synthesis system for high-throughput screening of gene products.FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and its degradation is sensitive to proteasome inhibition in cells (20Qian S.B. Princiotta M.F. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Characterization of rapidly degraded polypeptides in mammalian cells reveals a novel layer of nascent protein quality control.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 392-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we can also conclude that it is not generated as a post-lysis artifact. A simple explanation for fluorescent protein fragmentation is that it is a by-product of chromophore rearrangement (27Remington S.J. Fluorescent proteins: maturation, photochemistry and photophysics.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 28Barondeau D.P. Kassmann C.J. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Understanding GFP posttranslational chemistry: structures of designed variants that achieve backbone fragmentation, hydrolysis, and decarboxylation.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 4685-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The eGFP chromophore is generated by cyclization of tripeptide 65TYG67. Cleavage between Thr65 and Tyr66 would leave a 65-amino acid N terminus and a 173-residue C terminus with a calculated molecular mass of 19.9 kDa, consistent with the migration of GFP20 in SDS-PAGE. Mutations of the tripeptide alter GFP rearrangement and lead to different post-translational outcomes (28Barondeau D.P. Kassmann C.J. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Understanding GFP posttranslational chemistry: structures of designed variants that achieve backbone fragmentation, hydrolysis, and decarboxylation.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 4685-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To examine the contribution of chromophore maturation to fragmentation, we studied an eGFP mutant (GSGGF−) previously described to prevent rearrangement and hence chromophore formation (Fig. 2A) (28Barondeau D.P. Kassmann C.J. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Understanding GFP posttranslational chemistry: structures of designed variants that achieve backbone fragmentation, hydrolysis, and decarboxylation.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 4685-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We also studied a mutant (GSGF+) reported to induce eGFP cleavage between Gly65 and Ser66 as a positive control and comparator for fragment formation (Fig. 2A) (28Barondeau D.P. Kassmann C.J. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Understanding GFP posttranslational chemistry: structures of designed variants that achieve backbone fragmentation, hydrolysis, and decarboxylation.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 4685-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (note that F+ and F− refers to the fragmentation state of GFP, as will be confirmed experimentally below). We expressed WT and mutant eGFP fused to a C-terminal SIINFEKL (GFPS) or to an N-terminal NP-SIINFEKL reporter protein (NPSGFP) to precisely measure class I peptide generation by the 25-D1.16 mAb (specific for the mouse class I Kb molecule bound to the SIINFEKL peptide). We expressed all proteins by inserting the genes into vaccinia virus (VV) under the control of an early viral transcriptional promoter. We first infected L-Kb cells with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVVs) expressing NPSGFP(WT), NPSGFP(GSGF+), or NPSGFP(GSGGF−) and examined fragmentation by immunoblotting total cell lysates with an anti-GFP C-terminal antibody (Fig. 2B). As predicted, we detected both full-length NPSGFP and GFP20 for the WT construct, but only the full-length protein for GSGGF− (Fig. 2B). Importantly, the WT and GSGF+ GFP20 fragments co-migrated in SDS-PAGE, consistent with generation of the WT fragment by cleavage at the chromophore site. These results indicate that the mutation that prevents GFP maturation also abolishes GFP fragmentation, conclusively supporting generation of GFP fragment as a by-product of GFP chromophore rearrangement. Importantly, treating cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 had opposite effects on the generation of GFP20 WT (increased) and GSGF+ (decreased) (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2 versus lanes 3 and 4). Because proteasome inhibitors typically decrease protein synthesis (the decrease in NPSGFP is evident), these findings indicate that GSGF+ GFP20 is more stable than WT GFP20, which we have previously shown to exhibit a half-life of ∼15 min (20Qian S.B. Princiotta M.F. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Characterization of rapidly degraded polypeptides in mammalian cells reveals a novel layer of nascent protein quality control.J. Biol.

Quantitating the immunoblot signals in Fig. 2B reveals that the GSGF+ fragments represent 35% of the total amount of signal (fragments + full length), a value that changes very little with MG132 treatment (33%). The WT fragment increases from 24% of total signal to 38% in the presence of proteasome inhibitor. These findings suggest that for both WT and GSGF+ fusion proteins, roughly ⅓ of the full-length proteins are fragmented, which is consistent with our previous pulse labeling studies (see Fig. 6B in Ref. 20Qian S.B.

https://openalex.org/W1588589005,"Alterations in immune function have been documented during or post-spaceflight and in ground based models of microgravity. Identification of immune parameters that are dysregulated during spaceflight is an important step in mitigating crew health risks during deep space missions. The in vitro analysis of leukocyte activity post-spaceflight in both human and animal species is primarily focused on lymphocytic function. This report completes a broader spectrum analysis of mouse lymphocyte and monocyte changes post 13 days orbital flight (mission STS-135). Analysis includes an examination in surface markers for cell activation, and antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. Cytokine production was measured after stimulation with T-cell mitogen or TLR-2, TLR-4, or TLR-5 agonists. Splenocyte surface marker analysis immediate post-spaceflight and after in vitro culture demonstrated unique changes in phenotypic populations between the flight mice and matched treatment ground controls. Post-spaceflight splenocytes (flight splenocytes) had lower expression intensity of CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD25+ cells, lower percentage of CD11c+MHC II+ cells, and higher percentage of CD11c+MHC I+ populations compared to ground controls. The flight splenocytes demonstrated an increase in phagocytic activity. Stimulation with ConA led to decrease in CD4+ population but increased CD4+CD25+ cells compared to ground controls. Culturing with TLR agonists led to a decrease in CD11c+ population in splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls. Consequently, flight splenocytes with or without TLR-agonist stimulation showed a decrease in CD11c+MHC I+, CD11c+MHC II+, and CD11c+CD86+ cells compared to ground controls. Production of IFN-γ was decreased and IL-2 was increased from ConA stimulated flight splenocytes. This study demonstrated that expression of surface molecules can be affected by conditions of spaceflight and impaired responsiveness persists under culture conditions in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2274559771,"We examine the role of Lys-377, the only charged residue in helix XI, on the functional mechanism of the Na+-sugar melibiose symporter from Escherichia coli. Intrinsic fluorescence, FRET, and Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy reveal that replacement of Lys-377 with either Cys, Val, Arg, or Asp disables both Na+ and melibiose binding. On the other hand, molecular dynamics simulations extending up to 200–330 ns reveal that Lys-377 (helix XI) interacts with the anionic side chains of two of the three putative ligands for cation binding (Asp-55 and Asp-59 in helix II). When Asp-59 is protonated during the simulations, Lys-377 preferentially interacts with Asp-55. Interestingly, when a Na+ ion is positioned in the Asp-55-Asp-59 environment, Asp-124 in helix IV (a residue essential for melibiose binding) reorients and approximates the Asp-55-Asp-59 pair, and all three acidic side chains act as Na+ ligands. Under these conditions, the side chain of Lys-377 interacts with the carboxylic moiety of these three Asp residues. These data highlight the crucial role of the Lys-377 residue in the spatial organization of the Na+ binding site. Finally, the analysis of the second-site revertants of K377C reveals that mutation of Ile-22 (in helix I) preserves Na+ binding, whereas that of melibiose is largely abolished according to spectroscopic measurements. This amino acid is located in the border of the sugar-binding site and might participate in sugar binding through apolar interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1509329382,"Scatter hoarding of seeds by animals contributes significantly to forest-level processes, including plant recruitment and forest community composition. However, the potential positive and negative effects of caching on seed survival, germination success, and seedling survival have rarely been assessed through experimental studies. Here, I tested the hypothesis that seed burial mimicking caches made by scatter hoarding Central American agoutis (Dasyprocta punctate) enhances seed survival, germination, and growth by protecting seeds from seed predators and providing favorable microhabitats for germination. In a series of experiments, I used simulated agouti seed caches to assess how hoarding affects seed predation by ground-dwelling invertebrates and vertebrates for four plant species. I tracked germination and seedling growth of intact and beetle-infested seeds and, using exclosures, monitored the effects of mammals on seedling survival through time. All experiments were conducted over three years in a lowland wet forest in Costa Rica. The majority of hoarded palm seeds escaped predation by both invertebrates and vertebrates while exposed seeds suffered high levels of infestation and removal. Hoarding had no effect on infestation rates of D. panamensis, but burial negatively affected germination success by preventing endocarp dehiscence. Non-infested palm seeds had higher germination success and produced larger seedlings than infested seeds. Seedlings of A. alatum and I. deltoidea suffered high mortality by seed-eating mammals. Hoarding protected most seeds from predators and enhanced germination success (except for D. panamensis) and seedling growth, although mammals killed many seedlings of two plant species; all seedling deaths were due to seed removal from the plant base. Using experimental caches, this study shows that scatter hoarding is beneficial to most seeds and may positively affect plant propagation in tropical forests, although tradeoffs in seed survival do exist."
https://openalex.org/W1722121172,"Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that can replicate in the cytosol of host cells. These bacteria undergo actin-based motility in the cytosol via expression of ActA, which recruits host actin-regulatory proteins to the bacterial surface. L. monocytogenes is thought to evade killing by autophagy using ActA-dependent mechanisms. ActA-independent mechanisms of autophagy evasion have also been proposed, but remain poorly understood. Here we examined autophagy of non-motile (ΔactA) mutants of L. monocytogenes strains 10403S and EGD-e, two commonly studied strains of this pathogen. The ΔactA mutants displayed accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and p62/SQSTM1 on their surface. However, only strain EGD-e ΔactA displayed colocalization with the autophagy marker LC3 at 8 hours post infection. A bacteriostatic agent (chloramphenicol) was required for LC3 recruitment to 10403S ΔactA, suggesting that these bacteria produce a factor for autophagy evasion. Internalin K was proposed to block autophagy of L. monocytogenes in the cytosol of host cells. However, deletion of inlK in either the wild-type or ΔactA background of strain 10403S had no impact on autophagy evasion by bacteria, indicating it does not play an essential role in evading autophagy. Replication of ΔactA mutants of strain EGD-e and 10403S was comparable to their parent wild-type strain in macrophages. Thus, ΔactA mutants of L. monocytogenes can block killing by autophagy at a step downstream of protein ubiquitination and, in the case of strain EGD-e, downstream of LC3 recruitment to bacteria. Our findings highlight the strain-specific differences in the mechanisms that L. monocytogenes uses to evade killing by autophagy in host cells."
https://openalex.org/W285406471,"Adoption is rare in animals and is usually attributed to kin selection. In a 6-year study of eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), 11 of 326 juveniles were adopted. We detected eight adoptions by observing behavioural associations and nursing between marked mothers and young and three more by analysing the relatedness of mothers and young using microsatellite DNA. Four adoptions involved reciprocal switches and three were by mothers whose own pouch young were known to subsequently disappear. Adoptive mothers were not closely related to each other or to adoptees but adoptive mothers and young associated as closely as did biological pairs, as measured by half-weight indices. Switch mothers did not associate closely. Maternal age and body condition did not influence the likelihood of adoption but females were more likely to adopt in years with high densities of females with large pouch young. Adoption did not improve juvenile survival. We conclude that adoptions in this wild population were potentially costly and likely caused by misdirected care, suggesting that eastern grey kangaroos may have poorly developed mother-offspring recognition mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2339850073,"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the sinonasal mucosa either accompanied by polyp formation (CRSwNP) or without polyps (CRSsNP). CRSsNP accounts for the majority of CRS cases and is characterized by fibrosis and neutrophilic inflammation. However, the pathogenesis of CRS, especially CRSsNP, remains unclear. Immunohistochemistry of CRSsNP specimens in the present study showed that the submucosa, perivascular areas, and the mucous glands were abundant in fibroblasts. Therefore, we investigated the effects bradykinin (BK), an autacoid known to participate in inflammation, on human CRSsNP nasal mucosa-derived fibroblasts (NMDFs). BK increased CXCL1 and -8 secretion and mRNA expression with EC50 ranging from 0.15~0.35 μM. Moreover, BK enhanced cell proliferation and upregulated the expressions of proinflammatory molecules, including cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and -2. These functionally caused an increase in monocyte adhesion to fibroblast monolayer. Using pharmacological intervention and BKR siRNA knockdown, we demonstrated that the BK-induced CXCL chemokine release, cell proliferation and COX and CAM expressions were mainly through the B2 receptor (B2R). Accordingly, the B2R was preferentially expressed in the NMDFs than B1R. The B2R was highly expressed in the CRSsNP than the control specimens, while the B1R and kininogen (KNG)/BK expression slightly increased in the CRSsNP mucosa. Collectively, we report here for the first time that fibroblasts, KNG/BK, and BKRs are overexpressed in CRSsNP mucosa and BK upregulates chemokine expression, proliferation, and proinflammatory molecule expression in NMDFs via B2R activation, which lead to a functional increase in monocyte-fibroblast interaction. Our findings reveal a critical role of fibroblast, KNG/BK, and BKRs in the development of CRSsNP."

The viral tropism was predicted using the geno2pheno[coreceptor] and T-CUP tools with FPR cut-offs ranging from 1%-20%. Additionally, 27 RNA and 28 DNA samples were analysed in triplicate, 43 samples with the ESTA assay and 45 with next-generation sequencing. The influence of the genotypic susceptibility score (GSS) and 16 MVC-resistance mutations on clinical outcome was also studied.Concordance between single-amplification testing compared to ESTA and to NGS was in the order of 80%. Concordance with NGS was higher at lower FPR cut-offs. Detection of baseline R5 viruses in RNA and DNA samples by all methods significantly correlated with treatment success, even with FPR cut-offs of 3.75%-7.5%. Triple amplification did not improve the prediction value but reduced the number of patients eligible for MVC. No influence of the GSS or MVC-resistance mutations but adherence to treatment, on the clinical outcome was detected.Proviral DNA is valid to select candidates for MVC treatment. FPR cut-offs of 5%-7.5% and single amplification from RNA or DNA would assure a safe administration of MVC without excluding many patients who could benefit from this drug. In addition, the new prediction system T-CUP produced reliable results."
https://openalex.org/W1595110024,"The photocycle kinetics of Platymonas subcordiformis channelrhodopsin-2 (PsChR2), among the most highly efficient light-gated cation channels and the most blue-shifted channelrhodopsin, was studied by time-resolved absorption spectroscopy in the 340–650-nm range and in the 100-ns to 3-s time window. Global exponential fitting of the time dependence of spectral changes revealed six lifetimes: 0.60 μs, 5.3 μs, 170 μs, 1.4 ms, 6.7 ms, and 1.4 s. The sequential intermediates derived for a single unidirectional cycle scheme based on these lifetimes were found to contain mixtures of K, L, M, O, and P molecular states, named in analogy to photointermediates in the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle. The photochemistry is described by the superposition of two independent parallel photocycles. The analysis revealed that 30% of the photoexcited receptor molecules followed Cycle 1 through the K, M, O, and P states, whereas 70% followed Cycle 2 through the K, L, M, and O states. The recovered state, R, is spectrally close, but not identical, to the dark state on the seconds time scale. The two-cycle model of this high efficiency channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR) opens new perspectives in understanding the mechanism of channelrhodopsin function."

The objective of our research was to determine the response in soil respiration to above- and belowground organic matter manipulation in a Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) plantation. Five organic matter treatments were applied during a 2-year experiment: both litter removal and root trenching (LRRT), only litter removal (LR), control (CK), only root trenching (RT) and litter addition (LA). We found that either aboveground litter removal or root trenching decreased soil respiration. On average, soil respiration rate was significantly decreased in the LRRT treatment, by about 38.93% ± 2.01% compared to the control. Soil respiration rate in the LR treatment was 30.65% ± 1.87% and in the RT treatment 17.65% ± 1.95% lower than in the control. Litter addition significantly increased soil respiration rate by about 25.82% ± 2.44% compared to the control. Soil temperature and soil moisture were the main factors affecting seasonal variation in soil respiration. Up to the 59.7% to 82.9% seasonal variation in soil respiration is explained by integrating soil temperature and soil moisture within each of the various organic matter treatments. The temperature sensitivity parameter, Q10, was higher in the RT (2.72) and LA (3.19) treatments relative to the control (2.51), but lower in the LRRT (1.52) and LR treatments (1.36). Our data suggest that manipulation of soil organic matter input can not only alter soil CO2 efflux, but also have profound effect on the temperature sensitivity of organic carbon decomposition in a temperate pine forest."

https://openalex.org/W2102934006,"Mass tourism during winter in mountain areas may cause significant clustering of body injuries leading to increasing emergency admissions at hospital. We aimed at assessing if surgical safety and efficiency was maintained in this particular context.We selected all emergency admissions of open surgery performed in French hospitals between 2010 and 2012. After identifying mountain areas with increasing volume of surgical stays during winter, we considered seasonal variations in surgical outcomes using a difference-in-differences study design. We computed multilevel regressions to evaluate whether significant increase in emergency cases had an effect on surgical mortality, complications and length of stay. Clustering effect of patients within hospitals was integrated in analysis and surgical outcomes were adjusted for both patient and hospital characteristics.A total of 381 hospitals had 559,052 inpatient stays related to emergency open surgery over 3 years. Compared to other geographical areas, a significant peak of activity was noted during winter in mountainous hospitals (Alps, Pyrenees, Vosges), ranging 6-77% volume increase. Peak was mainly explained by tourists' influx (+124.5%, 4,351/3,496) and increased need for orthopaedic procedures (+36.8%, 4,731/12,873). After controlling for potential confounders, patients did not experience increased risk for postoperative death (ratio of OR 1.01, 95%CI 0.89-1.14, p = 0.891), thromboembolism (0.95, 0.77-1.17, p = 0.621) or sepsis (0.98, 0.85-1.12, p = 0.748). Length of stay was unaltered (1.00, 0.99-1.02, p = 0.716).Surgical outcomes are not compromised during winter in French mountain areas despite a substantial influx of major emergencies."
https://openalex.org/W1773157884,"RNA Polymerase II ChIA-PET data has revealed enhancers that are active in a profiled cell type and the genes that the enhancers regulate through chromatin interactions. The most commonly used computational method for analyzing ChIA-PET data, the ChIA-PET Tool, discovers interaction anchors at a spatial resolution that is insufficient to accurately identify individual enhancers. We introduce Germ, a computational method that estimates the likelihood that any two narrowly defined genomic locations are jointly occupied by RNA Polymerase II. Germ takes a blind deconvolution approach to simultaneously estimate the likelihood of RNA Polymerase II occupation as well as a model of the arrangement of read alignments relative to locations occupied by RNA Polymerase II. Both types of information are utilized to estimate the likelihood that RNA Polymerase II jointly occupies any two genomic locations. We apply Germ to RNA Polymerase II ChIA-PET data from embryonic stem cells to identify the genomic locations that are jointly occupied along with transcription start sites. We show that these genomic locations align more closely with features of active enhancers measured by ChIP-Seq than the locations identified using the ChIA-PET Tool. We also apply Germ to RNA Polymerase II ChIA-PET data from motor neuron progenitors. Based on the Germ results, we observe that a combination of cell type specific and cell type independent regulatory interactions are utilized by cells to regulate gene expression."
