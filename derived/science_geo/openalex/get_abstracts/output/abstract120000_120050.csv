In this study, the effects of protein kinase A modulators on human androgen receptor activity were tested. Using an adenoviral DNA delivery system, we demonstrate that the androgen receptor can be activated by a protein kinase A activator, forskolin, in the absence of androgen when androgen receptor is co-transfected into monkey kidney CV1 cells or human prostate PC-3 cells with androgen-responsive reporters. Immunoblotting reveals that there is no significant change in androgen receptor protein level following forskolin treatment, suggesting that the enhanced activity is due to activation of the receptor. This activation can be blocked by a protein kinase A inhibitor peptide. Two potent anti-androgens, casodex and flutamide, can significantly reduce this activation, confirming that the ligand-independent pathway is an androgen receptor-mediated phenomenon. An intact DNA binding domain of the receptor is critical for this alternate signaling pathway since mutants with reduced DNA binding ability are inactive. The phosphorylation status of the androgen receptor or associated proteins may critically modulate receptor activity and should be considered when designing improved approaches to prostate cancer therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2054575721,"To understand the physiological role of protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTPase 1B) in insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) signaling, we established clonal cell lines overexpressing wild type or inactive mutant (C215S) PTPase 1B in cells overexpressing insulin (Hirc) or IGF-I (CIGFR) receptors. PTPase 1B overexpression in transfected cells was verified by immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal PTPase 1B antibody. Subfractionation of parental cells demonstrated that greater than 90% of PTPase activity was localized in the Triton X-100-soluble particulate (P1) cell fraction. PTPase activity in the P1 fraction of cells overexpressing wild type PTPase 1B was 3-6-fold higher than parental cells but was unaltered in all fractions from C215S PTPase 1B-containing cells. The overexpression of wild type and C215S PTPase 1B had no effects on intrinsic receptor kinase activity, growth rate, or general cell morphology. The effects of PTPase 1B overexpression on cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation were examined by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis. No differences were apparent under basal conditions, but hormone-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation and/or insulin receptor substrate tyrosine phosphorylation were inhibited in cells overexpressing wild type PTPase 1B and increased in cells expressing mutant PTPase 1B, in comparison with parental cells. Metabolic signaling, assessed by ligand-stimulated [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen, was also inhibited in cells overexpressing active PTPase 1B and enhanced in cells containing C215S PTPase 1B. These data strongly suggest that PTPase 1B acts as a negative regulator of insulin and IGF-I signaling."

While the Src kinases are responsible for phosphorylation of receptor-encoded signaling motifs and for up-regulation of ZAP-70 activity, the downstream substrates of ZAP-70 are unknown. Evidence is presented herein that the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) is a substrate of ZAP-70. Phosphorylation of SLP-76 is diminished in T cells that express a catalytically inactive ZAP-70. Moreover, SLP-76 is preferentially phosphorylated by ZAP-70 in vitro and in heterologous cellular systems. In T cells, overexpression of wild-type SLP-76 results in a hyperactive receptor, while expression of a SLP-76 molecule that is unable to be tyrosine-phosphorylated attenuates receptor function. In addition, the SH2 domain of SLP-76 is required for T-cell receptor function, although its role is independent of the ability of SLP-76 to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation. As SLP-76 interacts with both Grb2 and phospholipase C-γ1, these data indicate that phosphorylation of SLP-76 by ZAP-70 provides an important functional link between the T-cell receptor and activation of ras and calcium pathways.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor-associated ZAP-70 by p56lck is a requisite modification resulting in the up-regulation of ZAP-70 catalytic activity (12Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R.

Therefore, the recruitment of the CD4 and CD8 co-receptors into the TCR complex positions p56lck to trans-phosphorylate ZAP-70. Phosphorylation and activation of ZAP-70, in turn, is required for both an increase in phosphoinositide metabolism and activation of the ras pathway. 2G. Kong, M. Dalton, J. B. Wardenburg, T. Kurosaki, and A. Chan, submitted for publication. The integration of these downstream signals gives rise to transcriptional activation of cytokine genes and a resultant elevation in cytokine synthesis and secretion (15Izquierdo Pastor M. Rief K.

SLP-76 is a recently identified molecule which undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon TCR cross-linking (16Buday L. Egan S.E. Viviana P.R. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol.

SLP-76 is structurally characterized by a C-terminal SH2 domain, a region enriched in proline residues which probably serves as the site for Grb2 binding, and an N-terminal motif which contains three tandemly repeated DYE(S/P)P sequences. We demonstrate here that SLP-76 is phosphorylated by ZAP-70 and that phosphorylation of these repeated tyrosine motifs is required for optimal generation of IL-2 in response to TCR ligation. In addition, overexpression of SLP-76 augments TCR-mediated transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene, while mutation of the SH2 domain attenuates this response. Together, these studies identify SLP-76 as a physiologic substrate for ZAP-70 and suggest a mechanism by which TCR-induced activation of ZAP-70 regulates both the calcium and ras pathways. Jurkat and Sf9 cells (Pharmingen) were maintained as described previously (12Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.-H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) H3 was generated against the SLP-76 SH2 domain. SLP-76 polyclonal antisera (22652) was generated against a peptide spanning amino acids 301-318 of human SLP-76. C305 is an anti-Jurkat Tiα/β- mAb (20Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar); 4G10 (UBI) and PY20 (Santa Cruz) are anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs; 2F3.2 is an anti-ZAP-70 mAb (UBI), and 9E10 is an anti-myc mAb. Anti-GST mAb was purchased from Santa Cruz. A full-length SLP-76 cDNA was generated by reverse transcription PCR from murine T-cell mRNA. This cDNA was appended with a myc-epitope at the 3′ end of the coding cDNA. Mutations were generated by PCR-directed mutagenesis and confirmed using standard dideoxy sequencing methods. These constructs were then subcloned into the pApuro vector (21Kong G.H. Bu J.Y. Kurosaki T. Shaw A.S. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1995; 2: 485-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the baculoviral vector pVL1393 (Invitrogen). A kinase-inactive version of ZAP-70 was generated by PCR-directed mutagenesis, converting Lys-369 to Arg. Expression of this kinase-inactive form of ZAP-70 results in a catalytically inactive enzyme (22Iwashima M. Irving B. van Oers N. Chan A. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1139-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar).2 A cDNA encoding Syk was subcloned into the PVIKS vector (12Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.-H. Wang T. Thoma R.

Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4793-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).2 Jurkat cells were stimulated as described previously (24Chan A.C. Irving B. Fraser J.D. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9166-9170Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Following stimulation, the cells were lysed as described previously (25Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. Vol 2.

Protocols for immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis have been described previously (24Chan A.C. Irving B. Fraser J.D. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kong G.-H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). For protein production, cells were infected for 36 h and lysed as described previously (12Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.-H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Proteins were either purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) or immunoprecipitated with an anti-SLP76 mAb (H3) or anti-SLP 76 antiserum. Sf9 cells were infected with human truncated ZAP-70 baculovirus (ZAP-70(K)) at an multiplicity of infection of 1. Cells were harvested 2 days postinfection, and ZAP-70(K) was partially purified as described elsewhere. 3H. Flotow et al., manuscript in preparation. Peptides were made by P. Keech and R. Handa (Roche Products Ltd.) on a Milligen 9050 peptide synthesizer. To facilitate binding to P81 paper, all peptides were tagged at the C terminus with three arginine residues as described previously (26Flotow H. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3724-3727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase activity was measured by incorporation of 33P from [γ-33P]ATP into a peptide substrate. Different concentrations of peptide were incubated with purified ZAP-70(K) or Lck as described previously (26Flotow H. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3724-3727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether SLP-76 might serve as a downstream substrate for ZAP-70, we generated a Jurkat cell line that expressed a kinase inactive form of ZAP-70 (designated ZAP-70(KD)]. This cell line expressed levels of endogenous wild-type ZAP-70 and SLP-76 that are identical to that of the parental cells (data not shown). In addition, Syk was not detectable in this cell line by either Western blot or in vitro kinase analysis (data not shown). The level of ZAP-70(KD) expression was approximately 10-fold greater than that of endogenous ZAP-70 (data not shown). Overexpression of ZAP-70(KD) markedly attenuated the ability of the antigen receptor to mediate [Ca2+]i, phosphorylation of cellular proteins, and IL-2 transcriptional activation (21 and data not shown). While cross-linking of the TCR in the parental Jurkat T cell line induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 (Fig. 1A, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2), there was a substantial diminution in the phosphorylation of SLP-76 in cells expressing ZAP-70(KD) (Fig. 1A, upper panel, lanes 3 and 4). Equivalent levels of SLP-76 protein were present in immunoprecipitates from both cell lines (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 is dependent on the catalytic activity of ZAP-70. To examine if ZAP-70 could be found in a complex with SLP-76, the ability of ZAP-70 to co-immunoprecipitate with SLP-76 was analyzed. ZAP-70 protein was co-immunoprecipitated with SLP-76 only following TCR cross-linking (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). This association was detected using both a polyclonal antiserum (Fig. 1B) and three mAbs raised against SLP-76 (data not shown). In contrast, no ZAP-70 was present in control immunoprecipitates using normal rabbit IgG (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). These data demonstrate that SLP-76 and ZAP-70 can be induced to form a complex which thereby positions SLP-76 as a potential downstream substrate for ZAP-70. To assess the functional role of SLP-76 in TCR-mediated activation, we expressed an epitope-tagged version of wild-type SLP-76 (designated SLP-76(wt)) in Jurkat cells. To determine the structural requirements for SLP-76 function, we also expressed mutated forms of SLP-76 in which the three N-terminal tyrosine residues within the YE(S/P)P sequences were mutated to phenylalanine (designated SLP-76(Y3-F3)) or in which the SH2 domain was rendered nonfunctional (designated SLP-76(R448K)). Stable clones with equivalent levels of both TCR and ZAP-70 expression were generated (data not shown), and the ability of the TCR to induce IL-2 synthesis was assessed (Fig. 2). Overexpression of SLP-76 induced an ∼2-fold increase in the transcriptional activation of the IL-2 promoter compared to parental cells. In contrast, mutation of either the three N-terminal tyrosine residues or the SH2 domain attenuated the transcriptional activity of the IL-2 promoter by greater than 50%. Together, these data provide functional evidence that SLP-76 plays a role in TCR signal transduction. In addition, these data indicate requisite roles for both the SH2 domain of SLP-76 and phosphorylation of at least one of the three N-terminal tyrosine residues in TCR activation. This functional effect observed upon mutation of the three N-terminal tyrosine residues suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 was required for TCR signaling. We therefore analyzed the phosphorylation status of the epitope-tagged SLP-76 wild-type and mutant proteins expressed in the stable transfectants. Following TCR cross-linking, both SLP-76(wt) and SLP-76(R448K) were phosphorylated to an extent comparable to that of endogenous SLP-76 (Fig. 3, lanes 2, 4, and 8). In contrast, mutation of Tyr-112, −128, and −145 to Phe abrogated the inducible phosphorylation of SLP-76 upon TCR cross-linking (Fig. 3, lane 6). These data suggest that Tyr-112, −128, and/or −145 represent the principal sites of phosphorylation within SLP-76. Moreover, the phosphorylation of SLP-76(R448K) suggests that the SH2 domain is not required for SLP-76 tyrosine phosphorylation and more likely participates in downstream regulatory functions to mediate IL-2 synthesis. To determine if SLP-76 could serve as a direct substrate for ZAP-70 or p56lck, we expressed various combinations of baculoviral encoded PTKs with SLP-76 in Sf9 cells. We have previously demonstrated that co-expression of ZAP-70 with the p56lck kinase domain (designated Lck(K)) results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 and up-regulation of its catalytic activity (12Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.-H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Expression of SLP-76 alone revealed no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein (Fig. 4, top panel, lane 1). Co-expression of SLP-76 with ZAP-70 revealed a low level of phosphorylation of SLP-76 (Fig. 4, top panel, lane 4). In contrast, co-expression of SLP-76, ZAP-70, and Lck(K) resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of SLP-76 (Fig. 4, top panel, lane 5). SLP-76 phosphorylation was dependent on the catalytic activity of ZAP-70 and not Lck(K), as co-expression of SLP-76, ZAP-70(KD), and Lck(K) resulted in no tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 (Fig. 4, top panel, lane 6). Expression of baculoviral encoded Syk resulted in the autophosphorylation of the Syk PTK. Consistent with the ability of Syk to undergo autoactivation (27Couture C. Baier G. Altman A. Mustelin T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5301-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Rowley R.B. Burkardt A.L. Chao H.-G. Matsueda G.R. Bolen J.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10498-10502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, data not shown), co-infection of Syk with SLP-76 was sufficient for SLP-76 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, top panel, lane 3). Finally, co-expression of Lck(K) at an equimolar ratio to the Syk PTKs (Fig. 4, bottom panel) failed to result in SLP-76 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, top panel, lane 2). Consistent with the absence of detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76(Y3-F3) in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3), co-expression of SLP-76(Y3-F3), ZAP-70, and Lck(K) in Sf9 cells abrogated SLP-76 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4, top panel, lane 7). Together, these data suggest that these three tyrosine residues within SLP-76 represent the phosphorylation sites for the ZAP-70 and Syk PTKs. To further investigate the enzymatic preference of p56lck and ZAP-70 in the phosphorylation of SLP-76, we determined the Michaelis constants (Km values) of peptides modeled around the three YE(S/P)P motifs (Tyr-113, −128, and −145) from the human SLP-76 sequence. Peptides containing tyrosine residues from these conserved N-terminal sequences were phosphorylated 10-40-fold more efficiently by the baculoviral encoded ZAP-70 kinase domain (designated ZAP-70(K)) than by baculoviral encoded Lck (Table I). Control peptides from ZAP-70 and myelin basic protein were not phosphorylated by ZAP-70(K). Consistent with the ability of p56lck to phosphorylate the trans-activation loop of ZAP-70,2 a peptide containing Tyr residues 492 and 493 of ZAP-70 was phosphorylated by Lck with a Km of 191 µM. A fourth peptide derived from SLP-76 encompassing Tyr residues 423 and 426 was also phosphorylated by ZAP-70 but with a 10-15-fold lesser efficiency compared to Tyr-113, −128, and −145. Interestingly, this peptide was preferentially phosphorylated by Lck with a Km of 40 µM.TABLE I.Phosphorylation of SLP-76 peptides by ZAP-70 and p56lck PTKs Phosphorylation of peptides incubated with ZAP-70(K) or Lck was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Peptide dilutions were performed in duplicate, and Michaelis constants (Km values) were calculated from 4 independent experiments.SequenceNomenclatureApparent KmZAP-70p56lckµmSFEEDDYESPNDDQSLP-76-(107-120)29550GEDDGDYESPNEEEESLP-76-(122-136)522170APVEDDADYEPPPSNSLP-76-(137-151)44.5450SLNGEWYVSYITRPEASLP-76-(417-432)48840LGADDSYYTARSAGZAP-70-(486-499)NDaND, no detectable phosphorylation at 0.25 mM.191HAARTTHYGSLPQKAMBP-(60-74)ND—b—, not done.RPSQRSKYLASASTMMBP-(5-19)ND—a ND, no detectable phosphorylation at 0.25 mM.b —, not done.

T cells expressing a kinase-inactive form of ZAP-70 demonstrated decreased phosphorylation of SLP-76. Furthermore, SLP-76 can be co-immunoprecipitated with ZAP-70 in a TCR-dependent manner and serves as a preferential substrate for ZAP-70 and Syk in vitro and in insect Sf9 cells. The association between ZAP-70 and SLP-76, however, is not direct since purified ZAP-70 and SLP-76 components do not interact in in vitro reconstitution experiments (data not shown). The interaction between ZAP-70 and SLP-76 is thus likely to be mediated by other adapter or effector molecules. Candidate molecules that may mediate this interaction include Vav which interacts with both ZAP-70 (31Katzav S. Sutherland M. Packham G. Yi T. Weiss A. J. Biol.

The co-localization of ZAP-70 with SLP-76 following TCR activation likely permits SLP-76 to undergo phosphorylation on tyrosyl residues. Expression of a SLP-76 molecule unable to be phosphorylated on any of the three N-terminal tyrosines within the conserved YE(S/P)P motifs (Tyr-112, −128, and −145) resulted in the inhibition of TCR function. Phosphorylation of SLP-76 by ZAP-70 presumably serves to generate docking sites for SH2-containing proteins and thereby provides a mechanism by which to link the activated receptor complex with phosphoinositide and ras pathways. Thus, phosphorylation of SLP-76 by ZAP-70 on at least one of these three conserved tyrosine residues is required for optimal induction of IL-2 synthesis. Our inability to detect phosphorylation of SLP-76(Y3-F3) in insect cells when co-infected with an activated ZAP-70 PTK suggests that these three tyrosine residues represent the major phosphorylation sites within SLP-76. This notion is also supported by the lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76(Y3-F3) following TCR cross-linking when expressed in T cells. Determination of Michaelis constants demonstrates a 10-fold preferential phosphorylation of the YE(S/P)P motifs by ZAP-70 in comparison to p56lck. Together, these data indicate that ZAP-70 is the upstream PTK that is responsible for the phosphorylation of the YE(S/P) motifs within SLP-76. This conserved motif is also present in p75HS1 (also known as SPY75), a protein required for B- and T-cell function (14Taniuchi I. Kitamura D. Maekawa Y. Fukuda T. Kishi H. Watanabe T.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 642-652PubMed Google Scholar). Given the preference demonstrated by the ZAP-70 and Syk PTKs for this motif, HS1/SPY75 is another potential downstream substrate of the Syk family of PTKs. The ability of p56lck to phosphorylate Tyr-423/426 within SLP-76 in vitro suggests that other phosphorylation sites within SLP-76 may exist. Given the absence of detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76(Y3-F3) in lymphocytes and insect cells, phosphorylation of these additional sites would require phosphorylation of one of the three N-terminal YE(S/P)P motifs. Finally, the inhibitory effect seen with expression of the SLP-76(R448K) mutant indicates that the SH2 domain of SLP-76 also plays a requisite role in the induction of IL-2 synthesis. However, the ability of SLP-76(R448K) to be phosphorylated following TCR cross-linking implies that its SH2 domain is not required for the efficient phosphorylation of SLP-76 by ZAP-70. Rather, the SLP-76 SH2 domain likely mediates interactions with downstream effector molecules. Tyrosine phosphoproteins with Mr of 64,000 and 116,000 have been described to associate with the SH2 domain of SLP-76 and may represent downstream effectors of SLP-76 (19Jackman J.K. Motto D.G.

Further dissection of the structural domains within SLP-76 which mediate its interactions with effector molecules, including Grb2 and PLCγ1, will be required to elucidate the mechanisms by which these proteins contribute to TCR function. We have recently observed the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated SLP-76 in ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates from TCR-stimulated Jurkat cells and in Jurkat cells overexpressing wildtype SLP-76."

Previous work in this laboratory has focused on elucidating the mechanism of NOx signaling in cells. We have demonstrated that NOx-induced activation of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein p21ras leads to nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFκB. Here, we investigated whether intermediary signaling elements, namely the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, are involved in mediating NOx signaling. We found that NOx activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) subgroups of MAP kinases in human Jurkat T cells. JNK was found to be 100-fold more sensitive to NOx stimulation than p38 and ERK. In addition, the activation of JNK and p38 by NOx was more rapid than ERK activation. Depletion of intracellular glutathione augmented the NOx-induced increase in kinase activity. Furthermore, endogenous NO, generated from NO synthase, activated ERK, and NOx-induced MAP kinase activation was effectively blocked by the farnesyl transferase inhibitor α-hydroxyfarnesylphosphonic acid. These data support the hypothesis that critical signaling kinases, such as ERK, p38, and JNK, are activated by NO-related species and thus participate in NO signal transduction. These findings establish a role for multiple MAP kinase signaling pathways in the cellular response to NOx.

NOx was found to activate human lymphocytes, as evidenced by increased glucose uptake, tumor necrosis factor α secretion, and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFκB. Further studies demonstrated that NOx directly activates p21ras, leading to downstream events such as the activation of NFκB (3Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol.

In the present study, we attempt to further clarify the NOx-signaling pathway downstream of low molecular weight G proteins such as p21ras by exploring the effects of NO-related chemical species on the ERK, p38, and JNK subgroups of MAP kinase.DISCUSSIONPrevious work in this laboratory demonstrated a requirement for functional p21ras in activation of NFκB by NOx (3Lander H.M.

We also found that reactive oxygen intermediates signaled through a similar mechanism and thus generalized our findings on signal transduction by NOx to include reactive oxygen species (4Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In those studies, we found that reactive oxygen signals through p21ras, MAP kinase, and NFκB. We concluded from these studies that p21ras is directly targeted by reactive free radicals and may be a cellular sensor for redox status (4Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).ERK, JNK, and p38 play critical intermediary roles in mediating signal transduction from the membrane to the nucleus (5Cano E.

Therefore, we investigated whether these signaling enzymes were activated by NOx and the NOx-generating compounds SNP and SNAP in human T cells. The molecular distinction between the different MAP kinase pathways lies in the substrate specificities of the MAP kinase kinases. There are six MAP kinase kinases in mammalian cells. MEK1, MEK2, and MEK5 activate ERK-related MAP kinases (29Ahn N.G. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 30Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E.

Our findings suggest that NO-related species and reactive oxygen intermediates activate the MAP kinases through upstream activation, most likely by activation of a low molecular weight G protein such as p21ras, Rac1, or Cdc42 (22Coso O.A.

Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The time course of activation of ERK by NOx was slow compared with the rapid effects of NOx on JNK and p38. This differential activation suggests that not all signals go through p21ras and that other related G proteins may be involved.JNK activation by UV light has been shown to be potentiated by the activation of p21Ha-ras (6Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2949) Google Scholar). This finding demonstrates that JNK signals via at least one p21ras-dependent pathway. Because the effects of UV irradiation often mimic those of oxidative stress, it was postulated that the UV-induced activation of JNK may be initiated by oxidative stress signaling through an unknown redox sensor. We have previously suggested p21ras as a redox sensor in the free radical-induced activation of NFκB (4Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The present study describes the activation of JNK by some of the same reactive species. It is possible that p21ras or other low molecular weight G proteins (such as Rac1 and CDC42) serve similar roles in JNK activation.NO is produced in many cell types (35Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4132) Google Scholar). The effect of NO on cells depends on its local concentration, the redox status of its immediate environment, and the susceptibility of target sites for modification (18Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 36Gross S.S. Wolin M.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 737-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Reactive nitrogen and oxygen overproduction is often associated with the synthesis of destructive species, such as superoxide, peroxynitrite, and nitrosonium ion. When these reactive species overwhelm the cell's antioxidant defenses, the resulting redox stress can cause lipid peroxidation, membrane damage, DNA breakage, and enzyme inactivation (20Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Our study suggests that cellular glutathione levels regulate a low molecular weight G protein-dependent nuclear signaling pathway in which the MAP kinases play an important role. Thus, the ability of NOx to trigger some signaling events within the cell, such as ERK, JNK, and p38 kinase activation, as shown herein, will likely be revealed under conditions in which cellular glutathione levels are depleted.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We have also identified p21ras as a general signaling target of reactive free radicals and suggested that it may be a cellular sensor for redox stress (4Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K.

In those studies, reactive oxygen species were shown to signal downstream of p21ras by activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Here, we examined whether activation of low molecular weight G proteins such as p21ras, Rac1, and Cdc42 by NOx also leads to activation of one or more of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family members. nitric oxide nitric oxide-related species sodium nitroprusside S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine extracellular signal-regulated kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein L-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine glutathione S-transferase.

The well studied ERK group is typically activated by growth factors via a p21ras-dependent signal transduction pathway (5Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem.

JNK and p38 MAP kinases respond to proinflammatory cytokines and environmental stress, although it is not clear whether this occurs via common or parallel pathways (5Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways leading to ERK, JNK, and p38 kinase activation are biochemically and functionally distinct (7Davis R. Trends Biochem.

Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). In the present study, we attempt to further clarify the NOx-signaling pathway downstream of low molecular weight G proteins such as p21ras by exploring the effects of NO-related chemical species on the ERK, p38, and JNK subgroups of MAP kinase. DISCUSSIONPrevious work in this laboratory demonstrated a requirement for functional p21ras in activation of NFκB by NOx (3Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We also found that reactive oxygen intermediates signaled through a similar mechanism and thus generalized our findings on signal transduction by NOx to include reactive oxygen species (4Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In those studies, we found that reactive oxygen signals through p21ras, MAP kinase, and NFκB. We concluded from these studies that p21ras is directly targeted by reactive free radicals and may be a cellular sensor for redox status (4Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).ERK, JNK, and p38 play critical intermediary roles in mediating signal transduction from the membrane to the nucleus (5Cano E.

Therefore, we investigated whether these signaling enzymes were activated by NOx and the NOx-generating compounds SNP and SNAP in human T cells. The molecular distinction between the different MAP kinase pathways lies in the substrate specificities of the MAP kinase kinases. There are six MAP kinase kinases in mammalian cells. MEK1, MEK2, and MEK5 activate ERK-related MAP kinases (29Ahn N.G. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 30Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E.

This differential activation suggests that not all signals go through p21ras and that other related G proteins may be involved.JNK activation by UV light has been shown to be potentiated by the activation of p21Ha-ras (6Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2949) Google Scholar). This finding demonstrates that JNK signals via at least one p21ras-dependent pathway. Because the effects of UV irradiation often mimic those of oxidative stress, it was postulated that the UV-induced activation of JNK may be initiated by oxidative stress signaling through an unknown redox sensor. We have previously suggested p21ras as a redox sensor in the free radical-induced activation of NFκB (4Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The present study describes the activation of JNK by some of the same reactive species. It is possible that p21ras or other low molecular weight G proteins (such as Rac1 and CDC42) serve similar roles in JNK activation.NO is produced in many cell types (35Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4132) Google Scholar). The effect of NO on cells depends on its local concentration, the redox status of its immediate environment, and the susceptibility of target sites for modification (18Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 36Gross S.S. Wolin M.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 737-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Reactive nitrogen and oxygen overproduction is often associated with the synthesis of destructive species, such as superoxide, peroxynitrite, and nitrosonium ion. When these reactive species overwhelm the cell's antioxidant defenses, the resulting redox stress can cause lipid peroxidation, membrane damage, DNA breakage, and enzyme inactivation (20Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Our study suggests that cellular glutathione levels regulate a low molecular weight G protein-dependent nuclear signaling pathway in which the MAP kinases play an important role. Thus, the ability of NOx to trigger some signaling events within the cell, such as ERK, JNK, and p38 kinase activation, as shown herein, will likely be revealed under conditions in which cellular glutathione levels are depleted. Previous work in this laboratory demonstrated a requirement for functional p21ras in activation of NFκB by NOx (3Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1972980743,"The effects of the human DnaJ homolog, Hsp40, on the ATPase and chaperone functions of the constitutively expressed Hsp70 homolog, Hsc70, were analyzed. Hsp40 stimulates the hydrolysis of ATP by Hsc70, causing a ~7-fold increase in its steady-state ATPase activity. In contrast to the prokaryotic Hsp70 system, ATP-hydrolysis and not the release of bound ADP is the rate-limiting step in the overall ATPase cycle of mammalian Hsc70. The ability to activate the Hsc70 ATPase is partially preserved in a deletion mutant containing the J-domain and the G/F region of Hsp40 but not in a deletion mutant that contains the J-domain alone. As a result of its ATPase stimulating activity, addition of Hsp40 allows Hsc70 to bind peptide in the presence of ATP, whereas in the absence of Hsp40, peptide is efficiently released upon ATP binding to Hsc70. The functional cooperation of Hsp40 with Hsc70 is essential to ensure the ATP hydrolysis-dependent binding of aggregation-sensitive denatured polypeptides, such as thermally denatured firefly luciferase and chemically denatured rhodanese. Binding of these proteins results in the formation of ternary complexes of Hsc70, Hsp40, and substrates. Hsc70 and Hsp40 cooperate with further factors in protein renaturation, as demonstrated by the finding that luciferase, thermally denatured in the presence of Hsc70, Hsp40, and ATP, refolds upon addition of rabbit reticulocyte cytosol.

We describe here an Arabidopsis thaliana protein kinase, designated Wak1 for wall-associated kinase, whose predicted extracytoplasmic domain contains several epidermal growth factor repeats and identity with a viral movement protein. Wak1 fractionates with insoluble material when plant tissue is ground in a variety of buffers and detergents, suggesting a tight association with the plant extracellular matrix. Immunocytochemistry confirms that Wak1 is associated with the cell wall. Enzymatic digestion of the cell wall allows the release of Wak1 from the insoluble cell wall fraction, and protease experiments indicate that Wak1 likely has a cytoplasmic kinase domain, and the EGF containing domain is extracellular. Wak1 is found in all vegetative tissues of Arabidopsis, and has relatives in other angiosperms, but not Chlamydomonas. We suggest that Wak1 is a good candidate for a physical continuum between the cell wall and the cytoplasm, and since the kinase is cytoplasmic, it also has the potential to mediate signals to the cytoplasm from the cell wall.

Plant J. 1993; 3: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Moreover, plant proteins can be identified that have affinity to the RGD motif that binds fibronectin in mammalian cells, and RGD can have effects on cell wall attachment to plant cells (7Schindler M. Meiners S. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1955-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A cDNA for a vitronectin-like protein was recently cloned, but although the antiserum identified a cell wall protein, the cDNA predicted translation elongation factor-1α and the importance was inconclusive (10Zhu J.-K. Damsz B. Kononowicz A.K. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 393-404PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, direct evidence for a protein or other physical continuum between the wall and the plasma membrane is still lacking. We have reported on the isolation of an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA that predicts a receptor-like serine/threonine kinase of 68 kDa and is encoded by a single copy gene (11Kohorn B.D. Lane S. Smith T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10989-10992Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This protein is predicted to have several functional domains, one with similarity to the family of serine/threonine kinases, and another domain that contains both epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorDTTdithiothreitolBSAbovine serum albuminMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidGSTglutathione S-transferase.-like repeats and a region similar to a viral movement protein (12Kohorn B.D. He Z.-H. Fujiki M. Protein Phosphorylation in Plants. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 297Google Scholar). We show here that this protein, called Wak1 for wall-associated kinase (previously called Pro25), is associated with the cell wall and spans the plasma membrane to have its kinase domain within the cytoplasm. Wak1 is found in all vegetative tissues of Arabidopsis and in other flowering plants. epidermal growth factor dithiothreitol bovine serum albumin 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid glutathione S-transferase. A. thaliana ecotype Columbia was grown in Metro-Mix 220 growing medium (Grace Sierra Horticultural Products Company, Milpitas, CA) under a cycle of 14 h of light and 10 h of darkness at 22°C. The coding region for amino acids 78-595 of Wak1 was cloned into the pGEX vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (13Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). Cells grown overnight at 37°C in LB medium plus 50 µg/ml ampicillin were diluted 10-fold in LB medium plus 50 µg/ml ampicillin. After shaking at 37°C for 90 min (cell density of A600 0.6-0.8), expression of the fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0.1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were incubated for an additional 90 min and then harvested at 4°C and resuspended in TSE (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 25% sucrose, 1 mM EDTA). Fusion protein was purified according to Smith and Johnson (14Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar) and Hakes and Dixon (15Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) using glutathione S-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech). Plant tissue samples were ground in 1 × protein sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50 mM DTT, 4% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) in microcentrifuge tubes using plastic pestles, boiled for 5 min, and the denatured samples were fractionated in 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes in 50 mM Tris, 380 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, and 20% methanol (17Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 490Google Scholar). Blots were developed using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Life Science). Silver staining of gels was performed using a Bio-Rad kit (18Merril C.R. Goldman D. Van Keuren M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Gel lanes were loaded with samples that represented equal percentages of cell preparations. Cell fractionation was performed essentially as described (19Cull M. McHenry C.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Marston F.A.O. Hartley D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To isolate cell wall, leaf tissues were homogenized in grinding buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM DTT, 1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml E-64, 2 µg/ml pepstatin A) using a Polytron (full speed, 3 × 10 s). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 3 min. The pellet was washed with ice-cold grinding buffer (without 1% BSA) 10 times. Finally the (cell wall) pellet was washed by resuspending in 500 mM CaCl2, 20 mM NaCl, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and spinning at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Arabidopsis leaf tissues were incubated in protoplast isolation buffer (1% Cellulase Onozuka R10, 0.25% Macerozyme R10, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.4 M mannitol, 10 mM MES, pH 5.7, 50 mM CaCl2, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% BSA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml E-64, 2 µg/ml pepstatin A, 2 µg/ml aprotinin) at 22°C for 2-3 h with gentle shaking at 60-80 rpm (21Masson J. Paszkowski J. Plant J. 1992; 2: 829-833Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The isolated protoplasts were filtered through a 70-µm nylon mesh and centrifuged for 10 min at 60-80 × g. The pelleted protoplasts were gently resuspended and washed four times with washing buffer (4 mM MES, pH 5.7, 0.5 M mannitol, 2 mM KCl) and visualized by light microscopy. Protoplasts were osmotically ruptured in a hypotonic solution (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) on ice for 15 min. Protease treatments were in 0.5 M mannitol, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and were terminated by the addition of denaturing buffer (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Isolated protoplasts were resuspended in membrane isolation buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8% sucrose, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 95 mM LiCl, 2 mM EGTA, 0.6% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and homogenized in a Knotes glass homogenizer at 4°C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the generated supernatant was subjected to 100,000 × g at 4°C for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in water and loaded to a two-phase partitioning system to purify plasma membrane (22Jenkins W.T. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The purified plasma membrane was determined to have 95% purity by a vanadate-sensitive ATPase assay using a pyruvate kinase-coupled ATPase assay (23Wheeler J.J. Gross W. Assefa H. Boss W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). For NaOH treatment the purified plasma membrane was incubated on ice with or without 0.1 N NaOH for 30 min before ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The NaOH-treated sample was later neutralized with HCl. The pellets were washed twice with extraction buffer before denaturation and fractionation. Tissue fixation and Wak1 immunostaining for light microscopy were performed as described (24Fehon R.G. Johansen K. Rebay I. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). For transmission electron microscopy, leaf tissues were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, washed with the buffer, and dehydrated in an ethanol dilution series. Tissue samples were infiltrated and embedded with London Resin White medium (EM Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Ultrathin sections collected on gold grids were blocked in 1% BSA in TBS-T (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and reacted successively with a 1:100 dilution of anti-Wak1 serum and 1:30 dilution of gold-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Sections were stained in uranyl acetate and poststained in lead citrate. Sections were viewed and photographed with a transmission electron microscope (EM200, Philips Electronic Instruments, Mahwah, NJ). Wak1 is 595 amino acids in length and has a putative transmembrane domain that separates the carboxyl-proximal kinase from the EGF-containing region. The coding sequence for a region containing the kinase domain and 2 EGF repeats (amino acids 78-595) was inserted into the pGEX expression plasmid for production of a fusion protein in E. coli. The GST-EGF/kinase fusion protein was then purified by glutathione affinity chromatography and used as antigen in rabbits (14Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar, 15Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The resulting serum reacted specifically with the GST-EGF/kinase fusion protein and with GST, but not other bacterial proteins. Reaction to the GST-EGF/kinase on Western blots could be eliminated by preincubation of the antiserum with purified GST-EGF/kinase, but not purified GST (data not shown). The serum was then used to probe whole cell extracts from Arabidopsis leaves, stems, roots, and flowers that had been run in a denaturing acrylamide gel and Western-blotted, and the results are shown in Fig. 1A. A 68-kDa protein is detected in each tissue, and this is the predicted molecular mass of Wak1. Preimmune sera do not detect a 68-kDa protein. The in vitro translation products from a full-length Wak1 cDNA were also included in the gel, and the protein detected by the antiserum migrates to the same position as the Wak1 found in plant tissue (Fig. 1B, Trl.). The Wak1 antiserum was used to probe Western blots of extracts from pea, tobacco, maize, and Chlamydomonas (Fig. 1B). In all species of higher plants tested but not the unicellular green alga, a cross-reactive 68-kDa protein is detected. To determine the subcellular location of Wak1, we used the Wak1 antiserum to probe plasma membrane, chloroplast, mitochondrial, and cytoplasmic leaf fractions, but Wak1 reactivity was lost during the fractionation, even in the presence of multiple protease inhibitors during the isolation. Previous whole plant extractions (shown in Fig. 1) involved grinding and boiling in a buffer that included 4% SDS and 50 mM DTT, and it was realized that Wak1 was remaining with the insoluble low speed pellet during cell fractionation. Leaves were then ground in a number of diverse buffers and detergents in an attempt to release Wak1 into a low speed (5,000 × g) supernatant, and the Western blot of some these supernatants is shown in Fig. 2. Only a combination of 4% SDS and 50 mM DTT, followed by boiling, could release Wak1 into the low speed supernatant. Alteration individually of the pH, ionic, or reducing conditions also could not extract Wak1 (data not shown). These results suggested that the 68-kDa Wak1 fractionated with the cell wall, as much of this material is also insoluble in a variety of detergents and buffers. The biochemical fractionation of Wak1 suggested a cell wall association, but due to the difficulty of solubilizing Wak1, associated cell wall components are hard to identify. The cell wall location can be confirmed with immunocytochemistry. The Wak1 antiserum was used to probe thin sections of Arabidopsis leaves, and these were visualized both under the light and electron microscopes. Gold conjugated secondary antibodies (Fig. 3A, arrows) to the Wak1 antiserum localize to the surface of cells, specifically in the region of the cell wall found between two adjacent cells (Fig. 3A, W). The plasma membranes in these sections are separated from the cell wall during the fixation, but these conditions were necessary for efficient antibody detection. Significantly, the gold particles are mostly found in the cell wall, but a few are occasionally seen on the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A, top right). These results are consistent with the biochemical observations that most Wak1 fractionates with the insoluble material. Preimmune sera shows no staining (Fig. 3B). (Note the ribosomes are slightly larger and less defined than the gold particles.) Localization by light microscopy reveals that Wak1 is present on the surface of all cells of the leaf. Fluorescent secondary antibodies (Cy3-conjugated) indicate Wak1 antibody is bound to the surface of all cells, as seen in 1-µm cross-sections of a 20-day-old leaf in Fig. 3C. Preimmune serum does not detect the cell surface. The chloroplast produces some chlorophyll fluorescence, but preimmune sera does not react with other organelles (Fig. 3C). Experiments with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody give similar results for all ages of leaves from their tips to bases (data not shown). The Western analysis (Fig. 1) indicated that Wak1 was present in all vegetative tissue, and this has also been confirmed by light microscopy. 2Z.-H. He and B. D. Kohorn, unpublished results. The Wak1 cDNA predicts a sequence (from amino acid 197-217) that is hydrophobic and could span a membrane and thus separate the EGF and kinase domains. The EGF repeats likely would be extracytoplasmic, as EGF domains are rich in disulfide bonds and are unable to survive the reducing nature of the cytoplasm (25Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The kinase domain was therefore predicted to be cytoplasmic, although the possibility of an extracellular kinase could not be ruled out. To probe the topology of Wak1, protoplasts were prepared from leaf cells by digesting the tissue with cellulase and macerozyme to remove the cell wall. Wak1 can be detected in intact protoplasts (Fig. 4, lane Pp) and also in a 5,000 × g supernatant of osomotically ruptured protoplasts (lane So). The digestion of the cell wall is usually not complete, and thus the protoplast preparation should include a population of cells that have some cell wall and associated Wak1. As expected, some Wak1 does still pellet at 5,000 × g in the osmotically ruptured protoplasts (lane Po), even though cell lysis, as assayed by light microscopy, was complete. Nevertheless, Wak1 can be separated from the insoluble material by the digestion of the cell wall. The intact protoplasted cells were also treated with protease to determine whether the kinase domain was protected by the membrane. Fig. 4 shows that thermolysin treatment of protoplasts removes ∼22 kDa from the 68-kDa Wak1 (lane Pth). The predicted extracytoplasmic domain is 200 amino acids, and this correlates exactly with the size of the portion that is removed. The kinase domain is predicted to be ∼40 kDa. Protease digestion of the protoplasts in the presence of Triton X-100 to disrupt the membrane (Fig. 4, lane Ptx), or osmoticum to burst open the protoplasts (lane Pos) renders Wak1 not detectable, and thus likely mostly digested. These data are therefore consistent with an extracellular Wak1 EGF containing domain tightly associated with the cell wall and a cytoplasmic kinase. In a separate method to determine whether Wak1 is integral to the outer membrane of protoplasts, we purified plasma membrane through phase partitioning of total membrane from protoplasted leaf cells. In non-protoplasted cells, less than 0.1% of the total cell Wak1 could be detected in a total cellular membrane fraction (data not shown). Fig. 4 displays the Western analysis of Wak1 in a plasma membrane preparation from leaf protoplasts. Wak1 is enriched in the purified plasma membrane fraction (lane PM), and only a small amount is detected in the fraction that represents other cellular membranes (lane OM). The purity of the PM fraction was determined to be 95%, as assayed by the vanadate sensitivity of ATPase activity (23Wheeler J.J. Gross W. Assefa H. Boss W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). When the PM fraction was subjected to 100,000 × g, Wak1 was found with the pellet and not supernatant (Fig. 4, lanes P versus S), even when the preparation was treated with the chaotropic agent 0.1 N NaOH prior to 100,000 × g (lanes PN versus SN). Thus Wak1 is an integral membrane protein of the plasma membrane. The plant cell wall, or extracellular matrix, is a complex arrangement of carbohydrate and protein whose composition has been difficult to study, due in part to its limited solubility. A number of proteins have been identified as integral components of the cell wall, but suggestions for a cell wall-cytoplasmic continuum have been few. The predicted topology of Wak1 from the cDNA sequence suggests a receptor-like function, such that this transmembrane protein would have a cytoplasmic kinase and an extracellular domain that contains the EGF repeats. The combination of the biochemical and microscopic evidence supports this predicted topology. Moreover, they suggest that Wak1 is a strong candidate for a physical connection between the ECM and the cytoplasm. Wak1 appears to be tightly associated with the cell wall, as only after cell wall digestion can it be released into a plasma membrane fraction. Wak1 can only be extracted non-enzymatically from tissue by boiling in 4% SDS and DTT, and this property suggests that Wak1 is associated with the cell wall. The electron micrographs demonstrate that this indeed is true, although the exact location within the cell wall is not clear. The nature of the cell wall-Wak1 association also remains unknown. The requirement for DTT for the release into a 4% SDS low speed supernatant indicates the presence of a covalent attachment, but it is not known if this is entirely proteinaceous. Alternatively, DTT may disrupt the disulfide-dependent EGF domain (25Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and thereby disrupt a non-covalent association with a cell wall component. A series of detergent and MeOH washes can be used to purify Wak1 (data not shown), and so it is not likely that Wak1 is covalently attached to the ECM. The cell wall association of Wak1 is not induced by the fractionation procedure, as addition of in vitro translated, radiolabeled Wak1 to a leaf and subsequent extraction, allows all of the labeled product to be recovered in the water-soluble fraction (data not shown). We suggest that the Wak1 in the cell wall is also membrane-associated, but as it is tightly associated with the cell wall, it cannot fractionate with the plasma membrane unless released by digestion of the wall. The electron micrographs showing Wak1 in the cell wall of cells in which the plasma membrane has shrunk away from the cell wall supports this suggestion. Wak1 in the plasma membrane of protoplasts is partly resistant to digestion by added protease, and the portion that is removed from the outside surface of protoplasts corresponds exactly in size to that expected for the entire predicted amino-terminal extracytoplasmic domain. In addition, plasma membrane Wak1 is not extracted by the chaotropic agent NaOH. These results are consistent with a trans-membrane topology of Wak1, where the kinase is cytoplasmic. Domain-specific antisera, however, will be required to verify this conclusion. A plant cell wall-associated kinase activity has been reported to phosphorylate a viral movement protein (26Citovsky V. McLean B.G. Zupan J.R. Zambryski P. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This activity is associated with mature leaves and is enriched in plasmodesmata. However, Wak1 is present in all vegetative tissues, and antiserum do not decorate plasmodesmata in thin sections. Moreover, Wak1 antiserum does not react with any protein in extracts that contain the plasmodesmata kinase activity. 3Z.-H. He, B. D. Kohorn, and V. Citovsky, unpublished results. We have detected autophosphorylation of Wak1 in bacterial extracts containing recombinant Wak1 protein, and nonspecific phosphorylation of substrates in vitro, and thus Wak1 does indeed have kinase activity (12Kohorn B.D. He Z.-H. Fujiki M. Protein Phosphorylation in Plants. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 297Google Scholar). The Wak1 cDNA was initially isolated through a selection assay (27Kohorn B.D. Methods. 1993; 5: 156-160Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 28Smith T.A. Kohorn B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5159-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that was designed to isolate molecules that interacted with the amino terminus of a thylakoid membrane protein. The Wak1 cDNA indeed interacted genetically with the target in yeast (11Kohorn B.D. Lane S. Smith T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10989-10992Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and can phosphorylate the target sequence in vitro (12Kohorn B.D. He Z.-H. Fujiki M. Protein Phosphorylation in Plants. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 297Google Scholar). However, as the target and Wak1 are present in separate cellular compartments, it is probable that the substrate specificity of Wak1 is relaxed when it is expressed in yeast or when it is provided with an abundant substrate. We have generated an additional antiserum to the Wak1 kinase domain, and this serum specifically recognizes a 50-kDa thylakoid protein called Tak1, that does interact with LHCP.2 On prolonged exposures of Westerns, Wak1 antiserum can detect Tak1, and this cross-reactivity may explain the few gold particles observed within the chloroplast after the immunostaining shown in Fig. 3A. It remains possible that Wak1 serves a structural role in serving as a membrane anchor for the cell wall, and while signaling and structural roles have been assigned to distinct molecules in metazoans, these functions may not be mutually exclusive in the plant cell wall. Future genetic and developmental analysis in Arabidopsis will help to establish the role of Wak1 in communication between the plant extracellular matrix and the cytoplasm.

https://openalex.org/W2058971952,"Repression of NFκB-dependent gene expression is one of the major elements of immunosuppression by glucocorticoids. Protein-protein interactions between the glucocorticoid receptor and NFκB have been characterized and shown to be a possible mechanism of mutual inhibition of transactivation properties. More recently, glucocorticoid-mediated induction of IκBα, an inhibitor of NFκB, has been described in monocytes and lymphocytes; an increase in IκBα mRNA and protein resulted in inactivation and cytosolic retention of NFκB. Thus, rather than the physical interaction between the glucocorticoid receptor and NFκB, the up-regulation of IκBα was presented as the key element in immunosuppression by glucocorticoids. In contrast, we show that the IκBα pathway is not involved in glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of NFκB activity in endothelial cells. Although transcriptional activation by NFκB was significantly reduced in the presence of glucocorticoids, we did not detect induction of IκBα protein that could prevent nuclear translocation of NFκB upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide or tumor necrosis factor α. Furthermore, treatment with glucocorticoids did not seem to affect the transcription rate or mRNA stability of IκBα. We therefore conclude that, although induction of IκBα expression by glucocorticoids seems to be of importance in monocytes and lymphocytes, it cannot explain inhibition of NFκB-dependent gene expression in endothelial cells.

The GR has been described as carrying out a variety of functions by several different mechanisms, some of which are posttranscriptional (11Knudsen P.J. Dinarello C.A. Strom T.B. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 4129-4134Google Scholar, 12Tobler A. Meier R. Seitz M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Fey M.F. Blood. 1992; 79: 45-51Google Scholar) but most of which are at the level of transcriptional control. Activation of gene expression by glucocorticoids generally requires binding of a receptor dimer to a specific site on the DNA (13Chandler V.L. Maler B.A. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1983; 33: 489-499Google Scholar, 14Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Google Scholar). However, transcriptional repression by the GR may be based on protein-protein interactions between the GR and other transcription factors, without the requirement for DNA binding by the GR (15Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Google Scholar). The latter seems to be of importance in the glucocorticoid-mediated modification of the immune response. Induction of cytokine gene expression is mostly dependent on the activation of the transcription factors AP1 and/or NFκB, both of which have been shown to interact physically with the GR, resulting in mutual inhibition of DNA binding and transactivation properties (16Schule R.

NFκB was originally identified as a heterodimer consisting of NFκB1 (p50) and RelA (p65) (23Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Google Scholar, 24Finco T.S. Baldwin A.S. Immunity. 1995; 3: 263-272Google Scholar). NFκB is constitutively present in the cytosol but is kept inactive by association with inhibitors of the IκB family (25Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Google Scholar). Upon exposure to phorbol esters or to inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), IκBα is rapidly degraded, allowing NFκB to translocate into the nucleus and induce transcription by binding to defined promoter elements. Recently published results on the repression of NFκB activity by dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic glucocorticoid and anti-inflammatory drug, focused on the effects of glucocorticoids on IκBα (26Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Google Scholar, 27Auphan N. Didonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Google Scholar). DEX was shown to induce the synthesis of IκBα mRNA and protein in monocytic cell lines as well as in T lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo, thus leading to increased levels of inhibitor in the cytosol preventing the release and therefore activation of NFκB upon signaling with TNFα or phorbol esters. The data presented led to the conclusion that rather than physical interaction between NFκB and the GR, the up-regulation of IκBα by DEX and consequently the cytosolic retention of NFκB represent the main mechanism underlying immunosuppression by glucocorticoids. To study the effect of glucocorticoids on endothelial cells, we analyzed DEX-dependent regulation of IκBα expression and NFκB inhibition in these cells. A small increase in IκBα mRNA and protein levels was noted upon treatment with DEX. However, this increase was insufficient to compensate for degradation of IκBα or to prevent nuclear translocation of NFκB upon stimulation of endothelial cells with either LPS or TNFα. At the same time, NFκB activity was greatly reduced: we observed DEX-mediated repression of NFκB-dependent gene expression. We conclude that although induction of IκBα synthesis by DEX may play a crucial role in preventing NFκB activation in monocytes and T lymphocytes, it cannot account for glucocorticoid-mediated repression of NFκB-dependent gene expression in endothelial cells, which emphasizes the importance of protein-protein interactions between NFκB and the GR in immunosuppression. Porcine or bovine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs and BAECs, respectively) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin G (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 µg/ml). Experiments were carried out on day 1-3 postconfluence. HeLa cells were grown under conditions identical to those applied for primary endothelial cells. THP1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin G (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 µg/ml). For transfection experiments, BAECs were grown without antibiotics and seeded at 3 × 105 cells/30-mm well. 24 h later, the cells were exposed to 1.5 µg of DNA (0.7 µg of reporter plasmid, 0.5 µg of GR expression plasmid, and 0.3 µg of β-galactosidase control plasmid) and 4 µl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal calf serum for 5 h. After addition of fetal calf serum to a final concentration of 10%, the cells were allowed to recover for 2 days. DEX was added at 0.1 µM 1 h before incubation with human recombinant TNFα (Sandoz Pharma, Basel, Switzerland) at 25 ng/ml or LPS (Sigma) at 1 µg/ml for 7 h. Cell extracts were prepared by repeated freeze-thaw lysis in phosphate buffer and assayed for luciferase (28de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. de Luca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase activity in an EG&G Berthold MicroLumat LB96P luminometer. The respective substrates were obtained from Sigma and Tropix, Inc. (Bedford, MA). Each experiment was done in triplicate, and several experiments have been performed with plasmids from different DNA preparations to assess the influence of DNA quality. The NFκB-dependent reporter construct (3 × NFκB/TK/Luc) was based on plasmid 34, kindly provided by A. Palmetshofer. The vector is a pBS SK+ derivative comprising the cDNA sequence of the firefly luciferase under the control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase minimal promoter starting at position −82 with respect to the transcription initiation site. The plasmid was cut with XhoI and NheI within the polylinker region preceding the thymidine kinase minimal promoter and ligated blunt ended with a double-stranded oligonucleotide (Midland Certified Reagent Co., Midland, TX) containing three binding motifs for NFκB (top strand: 5′-CT GGGAATTCCT CTGCT GGGAAACTTT CTGCT GGGAATTCCT CTGT-3′). The binding sites for NFκB were derived from the positive regulatory domains κB-2 and κB-3 of the porcine E-selectin promoter (GenBank™ U58943 (29Winkler H. Brostjan C. Csizmadia V. Natarajan G. Anrather J. Bach F.H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; (in press)Google Scholar)). The expression plasmid for the human GR was a generous gift from A. C. Cato, Karlsruhe, Germany (15Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Google Scholar). A vector expressing β-galactosidase under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter was used as an internal control in transient transfection assays. PAECs or BAECs were either left untreated or incubated with DEX (0.1 µM) for 1 h and then stimulated with TNFα (25 ng/ml) or LPS (1 µg/ml) for 1 h. Nuclear proteins were extracted as described (30Dyer R.B. Herzog N.K. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195Google Scholar), and protease inhibitors were included in all buffers (see “Western Blot Analysis”). The double-stranded oligonucleotide NFκB (top strand: 5′-CTGCT GGGAATTCCT CTGTA-3′) contains a NFκB binding site (κB-3) from the porcine E-selectin promoter (GenBank™ U58943 (29Winkler H. Brostjan C. Csizmadia V. Natarajan G. Anrather J. Bach F.H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; (in press)Google Scholar)) and was end labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and γ-[32P]ATP. 5-µg protein equivalents of nuclear extract were incubated with 100,000 cpm of radiolabeled NFκB oligonucleotide at room temperature for 30 min, and the resulting complexes were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in Tris/glycine/EDTA buffer at pH 8.5. A 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was included in competition experiments. The unspecific competitor oligonucleotide comprises the NF-ELAM1 sequence (top strand: 5′-GATTC TGACATCA CCGTA-3′) from the porcine E-selectin promoter (GenBank™ U58943 (29Winkler H. Brostjan C. Csizmadia V. Natarajan G. Anrather J. Bach F.H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; (in press)Google Scholar)). PAECs were pretreated with and without 0.1 µM DEX for 1 h before stimulation with LPS (1 µg/ml) for 0, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min. Cytosolic extracts were prepared as described (30Dyer R.B. Herzog N.K. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195Google Scholar) with the addition of further protease inhibitors: 0.1 mML-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 0.1 mM Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupeptin. 15 µg of protein extract were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%), transferred to an Immobilon P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting (Trans-Blot S.D. Semi-Dry Transfer Cell, Bio-Rad) and probed with the polyclonal antibody sc371 directed against a C-terminal epitope of human IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) and the Enhanced Chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PAECs or BAECs were pretreated without and with DEX at a final concentration of 0.01, 0.1, or 1 µM for 1 h before addition of TNFα (25 ng/ml) or LPS (1 µg/ml). 2 h later total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 µg of RNA were separated on an agarose gel containing formaldehyde, transferred to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) and analyzed by hybridization to radiolabeled cDNA probes of porcine IκBα (gift from R. de Martin (31de Martin R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V. Winkler H. Bach F.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Google Scholar)) and porcine E-selectin (29Winkler H. Brostjan C. Csizmadia V. Natarajan G. Anrather J. Bach F.H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Quantitation of bands was routinely performed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). All membranes were probed for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA to correct for unequal loading (32Subramaniam M. Colvard D. Keeting P.E. Rasmussen K. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 50: 411-424Google Scholar), and all quantitated IκBα and E-selectin transcript levels were adjusted accordingly. When exposed to inflammatory stimuli, endothelial cells rapidly activate NFκB leading to induced expression of cytokines and adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin (33Ferran C. Millan M.T. Csizmadia V. Cooper J.T. Brostjan C. Bach F.H. Winkler H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 212-223Google Scholar). While it has been shown for other cell types that glucocorticoids interfere with NFκB-mediated transcriptional activation (19Scheinman R.I. Gualberto A. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Google Scholar, 20Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Google Scholar, 21Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.A. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of DEX on NFκB-dependent gene expression in primary endothelial cells. BAECs were transiently transfected with the reporter construct 3xNFκB/TK/Luc (Fig. 1). The plasmid contains three binding sites for NFκB that were placed in front of an otherwise inactive minimal core promoter, resulting in strictly NFκB-dependent expression of the reporter gene, firefly luciferase. When cells were treated with TNFα or LPS, measured luciferase activity was highly increased (8- and 23-fold, respectively, in one representative experiment). Addition of DEX (at 0.1 µM) inhibited induction by 85-100%. The data demonstrate that NFκB-dependent gene expression is significantly repressed in endothelial cells treated with glucocorticoids. To determine whether the loss of function was based on reduced binding of NFκB to DNA, we exposed BAECs, as well as PAECs, to LPS or TNFα, with and without prior treatment with DEX. Nuclear proteins were isolated and tested for NFκB binding activity by EMSA (Fig. 2A). Binding of NFκB to the radiolabeled DNA probe was observed with nuclear extracts from cells incubated with LPS or TNFα. Pretreatment with DEX did not result in a reduction of bound protein. The binding activity was specific in that it was inhibited by a 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled NFκB probe, but not by an oligonucleotide of unrelated DNA sequence (Fig. 2B). All experiments performed with nuclear extracts isolated at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 24 h after addition of stimulus gave identical results (data not shown). Since the EMSA revealed comparable amounts of NFκB present in the nucleus of activated endothelial cells with or without treatment with glucocorticoids, we concluded that DEX did not prevent nuclear translocation of NFκB or binding of NFκB to DNA. Similar results have been described by van de Stolpe et al. (34van de Stolpe A. Caldenhoven E. Raaijmakers J.A. van der Saag P.T. Koenderman L. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1993; 8: 340-347Google Scholar, 35van de Stolpe A. Caldenhoven E. Stade B.G. Koenderman L. Raaijmakers J.A. Johnson J.P. van der Saag P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6185-6192Google Scholar) regarding the effect of glucocorticoids on the expression of ICAM-1 in U937 cells. The ICAM-1 promoter element mediating inhibition by DEX was identified as the binding site for NFκB. Also, in agreement with our data discussed above, these authors could not detect any difference in NFκB binding activity of nuclear extracts from cells treated with TNFα or TNFα plus DEX. They proposed a mechanism of protein-protein interactions between NFκB and the GR that did not alter NFκB binding assayed by EMSA but resulted in repression of the transactivation property of NFκB. In contrast, Scheinman et al. (26Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Google Scholar) and Auphan et al. (27Auphan N. Didonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Google Scholar) have recently proposed that DEX acts by inducing IκBα, resulting in cytosolic retention of NFκB as demonstrated by EMSA as well as by immunofluorescence staining. These investigators noted DEX-induced synthesis of IκBα mRNA and protein; the rapid degradation of IκBα protein seen upon stimulation of monocytic (THP1) and lymphocytic (Jurkat GR+) cell lines with TNFα or phorbol esters could be prevented by treatment with DEX. Basal levels of cytosolic IκBα were clearly increased, and although some loss of protein occurred upon incubation with the stimulus, the amount of IκBα never fell below the level seen in untreated cells. To investigate any effect glucocorticoids might have on the expression of IκBα in endothelial cells, we treated PAECs with and without 0.1 µM DEX for 1 h and then challenged the cells with 1 µg/ml LPS for different periods of time. Cytosolic extracts were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-IκBα antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, DEX pretreatment slightly increased the basal amount of IκBα present in the cytoplasm but did not prevent the significant loss of IκBα protein seen at 20 and 30 min of incubation with LPS. After 60 min, IκBα levels started to increase again, due to the usually observed autoregulatory induction of IκBα synthesis by activated NFκB (36Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Google Scholar). Since the increase in IκBα protein observed in HeLa, THP1, and Jurkat GR+ cell lines treated with DEX was mainly based on enhanced transcription of IκBα (26Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Google Scholar, 27Auphan N. Didonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Google Scholar), we examined IκBα mRNA levels in primary endothelial cells (Fig. 4). When incubated with DEX for 3 h, cells showed little or no increase in IκBα mRNA. Stimulation with TNFα resulted in a 12-16-fold induction of IκBα transcript. DEX given 1 h before addition of TNFα for 2 h did not modify the accumulation of IκBα mRNA seen with TNFα alone. Experiments performed with LPS yielded similar results (data not shown). The observation that IκBα transcript levels in endothelial cells are unaltered by treatment with DEX was noted in both porcine (Fig. 4A) and bovine (Fig. 4B) aortic endothelial cells. Furthermore, varying the concentration of DEX from 10 nM to 1 µM (Fig. 4B) and the time of incubation from 1 to 2, 3, 6, or 24 h (data not shown) did not lead to any changes in the effects described. To demonstrate that endothelial cells were responsive to DEX under the tested conditions, the same Northern blot membranes were reprobed for mRNA of E-selectin, an adhesion molecule the expression of which is reportedly inhibited by glucocorticoids (8Cronstein B.N. Kimmel S.C. Levin R.I. Martiniuk F. Weissmann G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9991-9995Google Scholar). TNFα-induced transcript levels were suppressed by pretreatment with DEX by 62-78%. Furthermore, we confirmed that under the culture conditions applied, HeLa, as well as THP1, cells (Fig. 4C) responded readily to DEX treatment: mRNA for IκBα was induced by 9-10-fold as previously reported (26Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Google Scholar). Thus, we show that primary endothelial cells do not up-regulate IκBα protein or mRNA upon incubation with glucocorticoids, as has been described for monocytic (26Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Google Scholar) and T-cell lines (27Auphan N. Didonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Google Scholar). Scheinman et al. (26Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Google Scholar) demonstrated a parallel increase of IκBα mRNA steady state levels and transcription rate in HeLa and THP1 cells, thereby reducing the possibility of regulation by changes in mRNA stability. We wondered whether the lack of an effect of DEX on IκBα transcripts that we observed could be explained by an increase in IκBα transcription rate, but simultaneous decrease in mRNA stability that would result in an apparently unchanged level of IκBα transcripts in endothelial cells. Therefore, we performed mRNA stability tests with RNA isolated from PAECs that were induced with TNFα (Fig. 5) or LPS (data not shown) for 2 h and subsequently incubated with actinomycin D (10 µg/ml) for 0-80 min. We observed no difference in the rate of degradation of IκBα mRNA in the presence or absence of DEX (0.1 µM), which led us to conclude that DEX has no effect on the stability of IκBα mRNA. To test separately for any influence DEX might have on the transcription rate of IκBα, transient transfection assays of BAECs were carried out with a reporter construct expressing the firefly luciferase under the control of the porcine IκBα promoter region −600 to +20 (31de Martin R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V. Winkler H. Bach F.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Google Scholar). Expression of luciferase was inducible by LPS or TNFα but not by DEX (data not shown). Taken together, these experiments confirm that in endothelial cells, DEX has no influence on the transcription rate or on mRNA stability of IκBα transcripts, resulting in a comparatively unchanged level of IκBα protein present in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, in accordance with the noted lack of IκBα up-regulation, NFκB is translocated to the nucleus at normal rates in the presence of DEX. Thus, direct interaction between the glucocorticoid receptor and NFκB, as characterized for the transcriptional repression of IL-6 (20Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Google Scholar), is more likely to be the mechanism underlying inhibition of NFκB activity in endothelial cells. While data on monocytic cell lines and T lymphocytes clearly demonstrate the up-regulation of IκBα and subsequent cytoplasmic retention of NFκB by treatment with DEX, we show that this mechanism is not involved in inhibition of NFκB-mediated gene expression in endothelial cells and is thus not a universal mechanism that can explain NFκB repression relevant to immunosuppression by glucocorticoids. We acknowledge Rainer de Martin and Alois Palmetshofer for supplying the IκBα reporter and plasmid 34, respectively, Eva Csizmadia for indispensable support in isolating and culturing primary endothelial cells, and Christiane Ferran for supportive advice and helpful discussions."

https://openalex.org/W2068847639,"The regulation of Ca2+-activated K+ channels (KCa channels) by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGMP kinase) and its molecular mechanism were investigated in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and tracheal smooth muscle cells. In CHO wild-type cells (CHO-WT cells) and in CHO cells stably transfected with cGMP kinase Iα (CHO-cGK cells), KCa channels with intermediate conductance (∼50 picosiemens) were identified. Due to the basal activity of cGMP kinase, Ca2+-activated K+ currents had a higher sensitivity toward the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in CHO-cGK cells than in CHO-WT cells. Dialysis of the active fragment of cGMP kinase (300 nM) into CHO-WT cells or of cGMP into CHO-cGK cells increased the Ca2+-activated K+ current, while the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP kinase) was without effect. In cell-attached patches obtained from freshly isolated bovine tracheal smooth muscle cells, the open state probability (NPo) of maxi-KCa channels (conductance of ∼260 picosiemens) was enhanced by 300 µM 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cGMP, a specific and potent activator of cGMP kinase. In contrast, 1 µM isoprenaline, 20 µM forskolin, and 3 mM 8-bromo-cAMP failed to enhance KCa channel activity. In excised inside-out patches, only the active fragment of cGMP kinase (but not that of cAMP kinase) increased NPo when applied to the cytosolic side of the patch. The enhancement of NPo by cGMP kinase was inhibited in CHO cells as well as in tracheal smooth muscle cells by the cGMP kinase inhibitor KT 5823 (1 µM) and the protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitors microcystin (5 µM) and okadaic acid (10 nM). The catalytic subunit of PP2A (but not that of PP1) mimicked the effect of cGMP kinase on NPo in excised inside-out patches. The results show that cGMP kinase regulates two different KCa channels in two unrelated cell types by the same indirect mechanism, which requires the activity of PP2A. The regulation of the KCa channel is specific for cGMP kinase and is not mimicked by cAMP kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2053423807,"Insulin activates rapidly a complex cascade of lipid and protein kinases leading to stimulation of mitogenic and metabolic events. Here we describe a renaturable kinase of 65 kDa (PK65) that becomes rapidly activated by insulin in differentiated L6 muscle cells (myotubes) and can phosphorylate histones immobilized in polyacrylamide gels. Insulin activation of PK65 was abolished by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erbstatin and by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitor wortmannin, but was unaffected by inhibitors of protein kinase C or of the activation of p70S6K. Recently, a number of protein kinases have been described which become activated through interaction with the small GTP-binding proteins Rac and Cdc42 (p21-activated kinases, or PAKs) and lead to activation of the stress-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 MAPK. Two different polyclonal antibodies recognizing the carboxyl-terminal or the Rac-binding domain of a 65-kDa PAK (PAK65) immunoprecipitated the myotube PK65. The insulin-induced activation of PK65 in myotubes was detectable following immunoprecipitation of the kinase. Furthermore, PK65 associated with and became activated by glutathione S-transferase-Cdc42Hs in the presence of GTPγS (guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate). In myotubes insulin also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. However, this phosphorylation was insensitive to wortmannin, indicating that p38 MAPK is not activated by PK65 in insulin-stimulated cells. The results suggest that insulin activates in muscle cells a renaturable kinase (PK65) closely related to PAK65. Tyrosine kinases and PI 3-kinase act upstream of PK65 in the insulin signaling cascade. Insulin activates p38 MAPK in myotubes, but this occurs by a pathway independent of PI 3-kinase and PK65.

The results suggest that insulin activates in muscle cells a renaturable kinase (PK65) closely related to PAK65. Tyrosine kinases and PI 3-kinase act upstream of PK65 in the insulin signaling cascade. Insulin activates p38 MAPK in myotubes, but this occurs by a pathway independent of PI 3-kinase and PK65. INTRODUCTIONInsulin mediates its metabolic and mitogenic effects by activation of a complex signaling cascade of protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases, as well as lipid kinases (1White M.F.

Two main branches of the insulin signaling cascade have been characterized, one controlled by PI 3-kinase, a dual protein and lipid kinase that phosphorylates phosphoinositides at the D-3 position (1White M.F.

These include Rac and Cdc42, which have been shown to control the actin-mediated membrane ruffling and the formation of filopodia, respectively (21Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D.

However, recent studies suggest that Rac and Cdc42, like Ras, also control signaling cascades of protein kinases leading to gene expression. In yeast, activation of Cdc42Sc by pheromone receptor-stimulated heterotrimeric G proteins leads to activation of a protein serine/threonine kinase, STE20, which is essential for the mating responses (23Leberer E.

Recent data suggest that PAKs may be intermediate steps in the activation of the stress-induced MAPKs p38 and JNK/SAPK, by Cdc42 and Rac (33Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar).PAK-like kinases were shown to become activated in response to chemoattractants and coagulants (31Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.-J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Nature. 1995; 269: 221-223Google Scholar, 32Teo M. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) but the possible participation of these kinases in signaling by tyrosine kinase receptors, particularly the insulin receptor, has not been investigated. PAKs share with other kinases the ability to renature following conventional SDS-PAGE (32Teo M. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activation of these kinases can be conveniently monitored by in gel assays, where substrates are trapped into polyacrylamide gels during polymerization. We took advantage of this assay to examine whether insulin activates PAKs or related kinases. In addition we investigated the effect of the hormone on p38 MAPK and the relationship between this kinase and PAK. These studies were performed in cultured muscle cells, which in vivo are a major target for the metabolic and growth effects of insulin (2Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocrinol. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSWe first examined the presence of insulin-responsive renaturable kinases in lysates of L6 myotubes using in gel kinase assays with histone VI-S or myelin basic protein as substrates. Insulin treatment of L6 myotubes induced phosphorylation of histone VI-S by a renaturable kinase of 65 kDa (Fig. 1A). We will refer to this histone kinase hereafter as PK65, for rotein kinase of 65 kDa. PK65 was activated rapidly (5 min) upon stimulation of the cells with 100 nM insulin. The activation of PK65 persisted after 15 min, but declined following a 30-min incubation of myotubes with the hormone. As shown in Fig. 1A, the PK65 of myotubes comigrated with a renaturable kinase identified previously in fMLP-stimulated neutrophils (39Grinstein S. Furuya W. Butler J.R. Tseng J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20223-20231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Brumell J.H. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1574-C1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).PK65 was the major kinase observed in histone VI-S-containing gels. A second kinase of about 40 kDa was occasionally detected, but, when present, its activity was not altered by insulin (results not shown). In contrast, when myelin basic protein was used as the substrate, an insulin-induced broad band of 42-44 kDa was detected (Fig. 1B). Earlier immunoprecipitation experiments showed that this band includes the MAPKs Erk 1 and 2 (results not shown). No other major renaturable kinases could be detected in myelin basic protein gels, but modest kinase activity could be detected in the 65-kDa and 80-kDa regions (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that histone is preferred as a substrate by PK65, compared to myelin basic protein.The possible dependence of the insulin activation of PK65 on tyrosine kinase activity and on signaling molecules acting downstream of the insulin receptor and IRS-1, such as PI 3-kinase, PKC, and p70S6K, was investigated. Treatment of myotubes with erbstatin (10 µg/ml) abolished activation of PK65 by insulin, implying that stimulation of PK65 requires tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 2). We have observed previously that erbstatin treatment of myotubes (under the conditions used here) inhibited the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. To evaluate the role of PI 3-kinase, myotubes were treated with WM. This agent (100 nM) also abolished the insulin stimulation of PK65 (Fig. 2). We have shown that 100 nM WM abolishes the insulin stimulation of PI 3-kinase in myotubes (4Tsakiridis T. McDowell H.E. Walker T. Downes C.P. Hundal H.S. Vranic M. Klip A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At this concentration WM does not affect the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 or the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Erk 1 and 2. 2T. Tsakiridis and A. Klip, unpublished observations. In contrast to erbstatin and WM, pretreatment of the myotubes with the PKC inhibitor BIM (1 µM) did not prevent the stimulation of PK65 by insulin. Similarly, we observed no effect of rapamycin (30 ng/ml), an inhibitor of the activation of p70S6K, on the insulin stimulation of PK65 (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Activation of PK65 by insulin: sensitivity to inhibitors. Serum-depleted myotubes were either left untreated or were preincubated with either 10 µg/ml erbstatin (Erb), 100 nM wortmannin (WM), 1 µM bisindolylmaleimide (BIM) or 30 ng/ml rapamycin (Rap) for 30 min, followed by incubation with 100 nM insulin for 5 min. Immediately following these treatments, the cells were washed and lysed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Whole-cell lysates were subjected to in gel kinase assays with histone VI-S as the substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since Fig. 1A showed that PK65 of myotubes co-migrates with a 65-kDa fMLP-stimulated renaturable kinase from neutrophils and recent studies demonstrated that this chemoattractant activates a 65-kDa PAK isoform (PAK65) in neutrophils (31Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.-J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Nature. 1995; 269: 221-223Google Scholar), we investigated whether the insulin-activated PK65 of myotubes is a PAK65-like enzyme. The reactivity of PK65 with anti-PAK65 antibodies was examined by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments using control and insulin-stimulated myotubes. A commercially available antibody against the carboxyl-terminal 19 amino acids of PAK65 (αPAKC19) recognized only a 65-kDa band in immunoblots of myotube lysates (Fig. 3A). This result suggests that PAK65 or homologous proteins are present in myotubes. Next, αPAKC19 as well as a second antibody against the Rac-binding domain of PAK65 (αPAKRBD) were used to isolate PK65 from lysates of control and insulin-treated myotubes. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to in gel assays with histone VI-S as substrate. As was the case for cell lysates, the immunoprecipitates showed renaturable kinase activity stimulated by insulin, which comigrated with the PK65 detected in myotube lysates (Fig. 3B). To examine the specificity of the immunoprecipitations, αPAKC19 was preincubated with its antigen, C19 peptide, before incubation with the myotube lysates. This preincubation completely abolished the precipitation of PK65 by αPAKC19, suggesting that the precipitation of PK65 by αPAKC19 was specific (Fig. 3C).Fig. 3Isolation of PK65 with anti-PAK65 antibodies and GST-Cdc42Hs. Serum-depleted myotubes were incubated for 5 min with (I) or without (B) 100 nM insulin before they were lysed. Lysates were used for immunoblotting (A) or subjected to precipitation by either anti-PAKC19 (αPAKC19), anti-PAKRBD (αPAKRBD) antibodies, or GST-Cdc42Hs-coupled to agarose beads as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, lysates of control and insulin-stimulated cells were subjected to immunoblotting with the polyclonal αPAKC19. B, immunoprecipitates obtained with the αPAKC19 or the αPAKRBD polyclonal antibodies, or whole-cell lysates were subjected to in gel kinase assays using histone VI-S as substrate. C, αPAKC19 antibody was preincubated with (+) or without (−) its antigen, a 19-amino acid peptide fragment from the PAK65 carboxyl-terminal (PAKC19pep), before incubation with cell lysates. The pellets of these immunoprecipitations were subject to in gel kinase assays with histone VI-S as substrate. D, lysates of untreated cells were subjected to precipitation with GST-Cdc42Hs-coupled to agarose beads preincubated with either GDP or GTPγS, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The pellets of the precipitations were then subjected to in gel kinase assays using histone VI-S as substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To demonstrate further the similarity of PK65 with PAK-like kinases, we examined whether PK65 could bind to GST-Cdc42Hs. GST-Cdc42Hs coupled to agarose beads was preincubated with either GDP or GTPγS before incubation with cell lysates. The isolated proteins associated with the GST-Cdc42Hs-agarose beads were subjected to in gel kinase assays. A significantly higher amount of PK65 activity associated with GST-Cdc42Hs in the presence of GTPγS than in the presence GDP (Fig. 3D). Cdc42Hs did not only bind but also activated PK65 in the presence of GTPγS. The results in Fig. 3D suggested that PK65 is probably a PAK-like kinase.Transfection of dominant negative PAK was found to inhibit Rac and Cdc42 or interleukin-1 activation of p38 MAPK in COS-7 cells (33Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation is an essential step in the activation of MAPKs (16Skolnik E.Y. Batzer A. Li N. Lee C.H. Lowenstein E. Mohammadi M. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Science. 1993; 260: 1953-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), and it is frequently used as an index of the stimulation of these enzymes. For this reason, we next examined whether insulin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in myotubes and whether this phosphorylation is sensitive to WM, as was the activation of PK65. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitations were performed from lysates of control and insulin-stimulated myotubes which had been pretreated with or without WM. The precipitates were probed with anti-p38 MAPK antibodies by immunoblotting. Some p38 MAPK was immunoprecipitated from untreated myotubes (Fig. 4). Insulin significantly increased the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAPK within 5 min. However, unlike the activation of PK65, the tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in response to insulin was not blocked by pretreatment with WM, suggesting that PK65 and p38 MAPK are activated in myotubes by independent pathways.Fig. 4Insulin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Lysates of untreated basal, insulin-stimulated, and WM-treated and insulin-stimulated myotubes were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-PY) antibody coupled to agarose beads, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-p38 MAPK antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONTwo different PAK isoforms, α-PAK and β-PAK of 68 and 65 kDa, respectively, have been identified in rat brain (27Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 30Manser E. Chong C. Zhao Z.-S. Leung T. Micheal G. Hall C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25070-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), while a third PAK isoform, mPAK3, was isolated from a mouse fibroblast cDNA library (29Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Additionally, in human leukocytes two PAK isoforms of 65 and 68 kDa were shown to be activated by chemotactic peptides (31Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.-J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Nature. 1995; 269: 221-223Google Scholar), and a third 62-kDa PAK isoform (γ-PAK) was cloned from rat platelets and was found to be activated by thrombin (32Teo M. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The results of Figs. 1, 2, 3 provided strong evidence that PK65, a renaturable kinase activated by insulin in myotubes, is either PAK65 itself or a closely related member of the family of p21-activated kinases. The relationship between these kinases is suggested by: (a) the cross-reactivity of PK65 with two different antibodies raised against distinct domains of PAK65, (b) the fact that both PAK65 and PK65 can renature after SDS-PAGE, and (c) the association of PK65 with the GTP-bound form Cdc42Hs, as had been described for PAK65.The results of Fig. 2 suggest that PK65 lies downstream of tyrosine kinases and PI 3-kinase, since both erbstatin and WM treatment of myotubes abolished its activation by insulin. The sensitivity of PK65 to WM (Fig. 2) is consistent with previous reports that Rac1 and Cdc42 associate with PI 3-kinase when in their active, GTP-bound form (42Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The 65-kDa renaturable kinase of fMLP-stimulated neutrophils, subsequently identified as PAK65, was shown to be sensitive to PI 3-kinase inhibition by either WM or the Lilly Co. inhibitor LY294002 (43Ding J. Badwey J.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 44Ding J. Vlahos C.J. Liu R. Brown R.F. Badwey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11684-11691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that activation of PI 3-kinase may be a widespread, perhaps essential step in the activation of PAK-like kinases.Neither BIM nor rapamycin affected insulin stimulation of PK65 (Fig. 2), under conditions expected to block PKC and activation of p70S6K. At the concentration used here (1 µM) BIM inhibits all isoforms of PKC (45Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the dose of rapamycin used here was shown previously to block phosphorylation of p70S6K (26Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar) and to inhibit the expression of GLUT1 glucose transporters in myoblasts (35Taha C. Mitsumoto Y. Liu Z. Skolnik E.Y. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24678-24681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, apparent that in muscle cells PK65 is activated by insulin through a signaling cascade that does not require activation of either PKC or p70S6K.Based on recent reports that PAK65 can participate in regulating the activity of p38 MAPK (33Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 34Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), we examined whether insulin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of this stress-activated kinase. The results of Fig. 4 show that insulin phosphorylates p38 MAPK. However, unlike PK65, the stimulation of p38 MAPK was not affected by WM. Thus, p38 MAPK appears to be activated in these cells by a branch of the insulin signaling pathway that does not involve PI 3-kinase.Since PAK isoforms function downstream of Rac and Cdc42, it is possible that these enzymes mediate some of the cytoskeletal functions of these GTP-binding proteins. We (37Tsakiridis T. Vranic M. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 41Tsakiridis T. Vranic M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29934-29942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others (36Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Ueda H. Kitamura Y. Sakaue H. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Calas B. Grigorescu F. Nishiyama M. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) have reported that insulin induces a marked reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Furthermore, it was recently suggested that Rac functions downstream of PI 3-kinase in the insulin signaling cascade leading to actin reorganization and membrane ruffling (46Kotani K. Hara K. Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, likely that in myotubes insulin activation of PI 3-kinase modulates cytoskeletal architecture by activation of Rac and/or Cdc42, which in turn could activate PAK65 homologous kinases such as the PK65 described here.In conclusion, insulin activates a renaturable 65-kDa kinase (PK65) in myotubes that functions downstream of PI 3-kinase. PK65 appears to be closely related, if not identical, to PAK65, a member of the p21-activated kinases. Insulin also induces tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in myotubes, but this does not appear to require the activity of PK65.

https://openalex.org/W2055675775,"Transcription of genes encoding nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunits (α, β, γ or ϵ, and δ) is highest in nuclei localized to the synaptic region of the muscle, which contributes to maintain a high density of AChRs at the postjunctional membrane. ARIA (AChR inducing activity) is believed to be the trophic factor utilized by motor neurons to stimulate AChR synthesis in the subsynaptic area. To elucidate the signaling mechanism initiated by ARIA, we established stable C2C12 cell lines carrying the nuclear lacZ gene under the control of the mouse ϵ subunit promoter or chicken α subunit promoter. ARIA stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of erbB proteins in these C2C12 cells within 15 s with a peak at 5 min. Immediately following tyrosine phosphorylation of erbB proteins, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase was activated which occurred within 30 s and peaked at 8 min after ARIA stimulation. Concomitantly, expression of AChR genes was induced by ARIA. ARIA-induced AChR subunit transgene expression was observed only in differentiated myotubes and not in myoblasts, suggesting that downstream signaling component(s) are regulated in a manner dependent on the myogenic program. Inhibition of the MAP kinase activity by using a specific MAP kinase kinase inhibitor or by overexpressing dominant negative mutants of Raf or MAP kinase kinase attenuated or abolished the ARIA-induced activation of AChR α and ϵ subunit gene expression.

This ligand-gated ion channel is a 250-kDa pentameric complex of four different subunits in a stoichiometry of α(2), β, γ or ϵ, and δ (1Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 2Duclert A. Changeux J.P. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 339-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The AChRs are highly enriched at the crests of the postjunctional folds at a concentration of 104 receptors/µm2, which is at least 1,000-fold higher than in the extrasynaptic membrane (3Froehner S.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 347-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 4Hall Z.W. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1993; 72 (suppl.): 99-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). During early development, however, AChRs appear throughout the membrane in myotubes. Innervation of myotubes leads to an increase in AChR synthesis, clustering of AChRs at the synapse, and subsequently to loss of extrasynaptic AChRs (4Hall Z.W. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1993; 72 (suppl.): 99-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The adult-type AChR contains an ϵ subunit in place of γ and displays different electrophysiological properties.A description of the molecular mechanisms underlying synapse formation at the neuromuscular junction is far from complete. Synthesis of AChRs is stimulated by ARIA, a factor that was identified initially in chick brain on the basis of its ability to promote AChR synthesis in cultured skeletal muscle cells (5Jessell T.M. Siegel R.E. Fischbach G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5397-5401Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This factor is a 42-kDa protein that has sequence homology with the Neu differentiation factor (NDF), heregulin, and glial growth factors (GGF), all of which are recently discovered ligands for erbB receptor tyrosine kinases (6Falls D.L.

In adult skeletal muscle, ARIA is localized in synaptic basal lamina (10Jo S.A. Zhu X. Marchionni M.A. Burden S.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 11Chu G.C.

Nature. 1995; 373: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The sequence homology between ARIA and heregulins immediately suggested a novel pathway for the regulation of muscle AChR synthesis by motor neurons, i.e. through tyrosine phosphorylation (for review, see Ref. 13Mei L. Si J. Life Sci. 1995; 57: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In fact, ARIA was found to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of 185-kDa proteins in the muscle (14Corfas G. Falls D.L. Fischbach G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Currently three erbB proteins (erbB2/HER2 (15Bargmann C.I. Hung M.C. Weinberg R.A.

EMBO J. 1995; 23: 5842-5848Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Among them, erbB3 (20Zhu X. Lai C. Thomas S. Burden S.J. EMBO J. 1995; 23: 5842-5848Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21Altiok N. Bessereau J.-L. Changeux J.-P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4258-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and erbB4 (20Zhu X. Lai C. Thomas S. Burden S.J. EMBO J. 1995; 23: 5842-5848Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar) may be localized at the neuromuscular junction. The mouse C2 muscle cells express erbB2 and erbB3, and little, if any, erbB4 (10Jo S.A. Zhu X. Marchionni M.A. Burden S.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This suggests that one or a combination of these erbB receptor tyrosine kinases may represent the ARIA receptor.The signal transduction pathway initiated by ARIA after activation of the erbB receptor tyrosine kinases has not been elucidated. We established C2C12 cell lines, which stably possessed the nlacZ gene under control of the promoter of the AChR α or ϵ subunit to study the signal transduction mechanism of the ARIA-induced activation of AChR gene expression. In this report, we provide evidence that ARIA-mediated induction of AChR gene expression requires the activation of MAP kinase.DISCUSSIONTo study mechanisms by which ARIA activates AChR gene expression, we have generated stable C2C12 cells which possess the ϵ3500-nlacZ or α-nlacZ transgene. We believe that the C2C12 cells carrying these transgenes are an excellent in vitro model to study the molecular mechanism of AChR gene induction for several reasons. First, the C2C12 muscle cells have been used successfully as an expression system to study transcription of muscle genes and have the unusual capability to activate muscle-specific genes upon fusion (24Blau H.M. Chiu C.P. Webster C. Cell. 1983; 32: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Second, recent studies demonstrated that the C2C12 muscle cells have the essential elements required for the ARIA-induced activation of AChR gene expression (10Jo S.A. Zhu X. Marchionni M.A. Burden S.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of the ϵ3500-nlacZ and α-nlacZ transgene is spatially restricted in muscle nuclei beneath the motor end plate in transgenic mice (27Sanes J.R. Johnson Y.R. Kotzbauer P.T. Mudd J. Hanley T. Martinou J.C. Merlie J.P. Development. 1991; 113: 1181-1191PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these promoters contain the elements necessary to respond to natural cues released from motoneurons. In vitro, ARIA treatment of muscle fibers isolated from transgenic mice carrying ϵ3500-nlacZ transgene induces the AChR ϵ subunit gene expression (11Chu G.C. Moscoso L.M. Sliwkowski M.X. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 329-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We show here that in the C2C12 myotubes stably carrying these transgenes, ARIA was able to induce the AChR α and ϵ gene expression (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Interestingly, we found that ARIA treatment of the C2C12 myotubes resulted in activation of MAP kinase (Fig. 5) which followed in time the tyrosine phosphorylation of erbB proteins (Fig. 4). Moreover, the ARIA-induced expression of AChR α and ϵ subunit genes was dependent on activation of MAP kinase. Inhibition of MEK or Raf in C2C12 myotubes blocked activation of AChR gene expression by ARIA. These results suggest a machinery for the ARIA-induced activation of AChR gene expression which begins with stimulation of the erbB receptor tyrosine kinases and requires activation of the Raf/MEK/MAP kinase pathway.ARIA induces tyrosine phosphorylation of 185-kDa erbB proteins in chicken (14Corfas G. Falls D.L. Fischbach G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Altiok N. Bessereau J.-L. Changeux J.-P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4258-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 4, 10). Within seconds of ARIA stimulation, erbB proteins became tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 4). Treatment of chicken myotubes with erbstatin, a specific inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinase, inhibits ARIA-elicited increase in α subunit mRNA (21Altiok N. Bessereau J.-L. Changeux J.-P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4258-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, vanadate, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, potentiates ARIA-induced AChR gene activation in chicken or C2 myotubes (Ref. 21Altiok N. Bessereau J.-L. Changeux J.-P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4258-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar and Fig. 3). The close correlation of ARIA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the erbB proteins with activation of AChR gene expression suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation is a key step in the ARIA signaling pathway. NDF/heregulin (or ARIA) was initially identified by its ability to activate erbB2; however, it does not interact directly with the erbB2 protein (41Peles E. Ben-Levy R. Tzahar E. Liu N. Wen D. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Its receptor appears to be erbB3 (42Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Carraway K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R. Platko J.V. Guy P.M.

Culouscou J.M. Carlton G.W. Rothwell V.M. Buckley S. Nature. 1993; 366: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 45Tzahar E. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran D. Yi L. Peles E. Lavi S. Chang D. Liu N. Yayon A. Wen D. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25226-25233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since erbB3 has little, if any, tyrosine kinase activity (46Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), signaling through erbB3 has been postulated to require ligand-stimulated dimerization of erbB3 with another erbB protein or EGF receptor. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells and mammary carcinoma-derived MCF-7 cells, erbB2 forms heterodimers with erbB3 upon heregulin stimulation (47Wallasch C. Weib F.U. Niederfellner G. Jallal B. Issing W. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The erbB2 and EGF receptor can associate into an active heterodimeric tyrosine kinase (48Qian X. LeVea C.M. Freeman J.K. Dougall W.C. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1500-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The C2 cells express erbB2 and erbB3 but not erbB4 (10Jo S.A. Zhu X. Marchionni M.A. Burden S.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 20Zhu X. Lai C. Thomas S. Burden S.J. EMBO J. 1995; 23: 5842-5848Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ARIA-triggered signaling in C2 cells is initiated by erbB3. Wright et al. (49Wright J.D. Reuter C.W. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12085-12093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have shown that EGF can stimulate a kinase-dead EGF receptor to activate MAP kinase via association with erbB2. In C2C12 cells, presumably, ARIA binds to erbB3 which has little kinase activity and stimulates MAP kinase by interacting with erbB2 or erbB2-related tyrosine kinase.The activation of receptor tyrosine kinases by ligands initiates signal transduction cascades essential for cell proliferation and differentiation. The 21-kDa Ras proteins function as signaling mediators for activated receptor tyrosine kinases (50Marshall M.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Binding of adaptor proteins such as Grb2 and/or Shc to tyrosine-phosphorylated intracellular domains recruits guanine nucleotide exchanger proteins to the receptor complex, which promotes exchange of GTP for GDP and thus activates Ras proteins. There are several consensus binding sites for Grb2 and Shc in erbB2, erbB3, and erbB4 (43Carraway K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R. Platko J.V. Guy P.M. Nuijens A. Diamonti A.J. Vandlen R.L. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14303-14306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, erbB2 and erbB3 have been shown to bind to Grb2 (51D'souza B. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7202-7206Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 52Segatto O. Pelicci G. Giuli S. Digiesi G. Di Fiore P.P. McGlade J. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2105-2112PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of constitutively active erbB2 in NIH3T3 cells activates Ras by forming complex with Shc/Grb2/Sos (53Xie Y. Pendergast A.M. Hung M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30717-30724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). NDF has been recently found to stimulate growth and proliferation of mammary epithelial cells, which was accompanied by activation of MAP kinase (36Marte B.M. Graus-Porta D. Jeschke M. Fabbro D. Hynes N.E. Taverna D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 167-175PubMed Google Scholar). We found that ARIA activated MAP kinase via the Raf/MEK pathway in terminally differentiated C2C12 myotubes, and such an activation is required for ARIA-induced AChR gene expression. This suggests an important role of MAP kinase even in highly differentiated cells. In addition to Raf, Ras also stimulates many signaling proteins including PI 3-kinase, protein kinase C ζ, and MEK kinase (50Marshall M.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Stimulation of cells with EGF results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of erbB3 and the recruitment of PI 3-kinase to this receptor (38Soltoff S.P. Carraway K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Moreover, NDF activates the p70/p85 S6 kinase pathway in mammary epithelial cells (36Marte B.M. Graus-Porta D. Jeschke M. Fabbro D. Hynes N.E. Taverna D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 167-175PubMed Google Scholar). However, the inability of wortmannin and rapamycin, well characterized inhibitors of PI 3-kinase and S6 kinase, respectively, to affect the ARIA-induced activation of AChR gene expression in C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 8) suggests that activation of these enzymes is probably not involved in this event.Activated MAP kinase is believed to translocate into nuclei and activate gene expression by phosphorylating respective transcriptional factors (30Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that ARIA-induced activation of AChR α and ϵ gene expression in the C2C12 cells appeared to be dependent on the state of cell differentiation. Treatment with ARIA had little, if any, effect on the reporter gene expression in ϵ1 myoblasts (Fig. 1) and in α1 myoblasts (data not shown). Only after differentiation into myotubes did the C2C12 cells respond to ARIA with increased expression of the reporter gene. However, ARIA was able to elicit tyrosine phosphorylation of the erbB proteins and activation of MAP kinase in C2C12 myoblasts. Moreover, ARIA-activated MAP kinase appeared to be able to translocate into nuclei in C2C12 myotubes. 3J. Si and L. Mei, unpublished data. These results suggest that downstream signaling component(s) are regulated in a manner dependent on the myogenic program.Following formation of neuromuscular junctions, in addition to the ARIA pathway, motor neurons control the AChR gene transcription also by eliciting AChR-evoked muscle depolarization, which represses AChR gene expression in extrasynaptic nuclei (54Martinou J.C. Merlie J.P. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1291-1299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; for review, see Refs. 2Duclert A. Changeux J.P. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 339-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar and 4Hall Z.W. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1993; 72 (suppl.): 99-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The electric activity-dependent repression of AChR gene transcription in extrasynaptic nuclei probably involves activation of protein kinase C, a serine/threonine kinase (55Huang C.-F. Tong J. Schmidt J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was reported recently that treatment of chick myotubes with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate, a stimulator of protein kinase C, blocks heregulin/NDF (or ARIA)-activated AChR α subunit expression, presumably via inhibiting the heregulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the erbB2 and erbB3 proteins (21Altiok N. Bessereau J.-L. Changeux J.-P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4258-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These data suggest a coordination among different regulatory mechanisms of AChR gene expression by the ARIA pathway, the myogenic factors, and the electric activity-dependent regulation.In summary, we have shown that ARIA activates MAP kinase in C2C12 myotubes which is required for ARIA-induced activation of AChR gene expression. Activation of MAP kinase occurs after tyrosine phosphorylation of ARIA receptors. Inhibition of MAP kinase activation blocks ARIA-dependent stimulation of AChR gene expression. We propose a pathway for ARIA-induced activation of AChR gene expression which begins with stimulation of the erbB protein tyrosine kinases and requires activation of the Raf/MEK/MAP kinase pathway. The C2C12 cells stably possessing AChR transgenes should prove to be a good model to further elucidate regulatory mechanisms of AChR gene expression.

This ligand-gated ion channel is a 250-kDa pentameric complex of four different subunits in a stoichiometry of α(2), β, γ or ϵ, and δ (1Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 2Duclert A. Changeux J.P. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 339-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The AChRs are highly enriched at the crests of the postjunctional folds at a concentration of 104 receptors/µm2, which is at least 1,000-fold higher than in the extrasynaptic membrane (3Froehner S.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 347-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 4Hall Z.W. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1993; 72 (suppl.): 99-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). During early development, however, AChRs appear throughout the membrane in myotubes. Innervation of myotubes leads to an increase in AChR synthesis, clustering of AChRs at the synapse, and subsequently to loss of extrasynaptic AChRs (4Hall Z.W. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1993; 72 (suppl.): 99-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The adult-type AChR contains an ϵ subunit in place of γ and displays different electrophysiological properties.A description of the molecular mechanisms underlying synapse formation at the neuromuscular junction is far from complete. Synthesis of AChRs is stimulated by ARIA, a factor that was identified initially in chick brain on the basis of its ability to promote AChR synthesis in cultured skeletal muscle cells (5Jessell T.M. Siegel R.E. Fischbach G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5397-5401Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This factor is a 42-kDa protein that has sequence homology with the Neu differentiation factor (NDF), heregulin, and glial growth factors (GGF), all of which are recently discovered ligands for erbB receptor tyrosine kinases (6Falls D.L.

In adult skeletal muscle, ARIA is localized in synaptic basal lamina (10Jo S.A. Zhu X. Marchionni M.A. Burden S.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 11Chu G.C.

The sequence homology between ARIA and heregulins immediately suggested a novel pathway for the regulation of muscle AChR synthesis by motor neurons, i.e. through tyrosine phosphorylation (for review, see Ref. 13Mei L. Si J. Life Sci. 1995; 57: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In fact, ARIA was found to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of 185-kDa proteins in the muscle (14Corfas G. Falls D.L.

This suggests that one or a combination of these erbB receptor tyrosine kinases may represent the ARIA receptor.The signal transduction pathway initiated by ARIA after activation of the erbB receptor tyrosine kinases has not been elucidated. We established C2C12 cell lines, which stably possessed the nlacZ gene under control of the promoter of the AChR α or ϵ subunit to study the signal transduction mechanism of the ARIA-induced activation of AChR gene expression. In this report, we provide evidence that ARIA-mediated induction of AChR gene expression requires the activation of MAP kinase."

Overexpression using the vaccinia virus/T7 phage system resulted in secretion of approximately 30 mg of decorin/109 cells per 24 h which enabled purification and separation of multiple glycoforms under native conditions. Cells were cultured in the presence of [35S]methionine or a mixture of [3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate, and recombinant glycoprotein purified by metal affinity chromatography which resolved the secreted decorin into two classes, a proteoglycan form and a core protein form. About 25% of the recombinant protein was secreted into the culture medium as core protein devoid of glycosaminoglycan chains. The decorin core protein was resolved into two forms (~49 and ~53 kDa) that differed in the extent of N-linked oligosaccharide substitution (2 and 3 N-linked oligosaccharides, respectively). Deglycosylation of the recombinant proteoglycans and core proteins resulted in a single band migrating with an apparent molecular mass ~ 43 kDa when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Far-UV circular dichroism spectra of native decorin proteoglycan showed a minima at 218 nm, consistent with a secondary structure that is predominantly β-sheet. Circular dichroism spectra of bovine decorin extracted from articular cartilage and recombinant decorin similarly treated revealed a minima of 205 nm indicating a loss of secondary structure.

https://openalex.org/W2046836400,"Plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) isoforms NHE1 and NHE3 exhibit very different sensitivities to amiloride and its 5-amino-substituted analogues, benzoyl guanidinium derivatives (e.g. (3-methylsulfonyl-4-piperidinobenzoyl)guanidine methanesulfonate (HOE694)), and cimetidine. To define structural domains that confer differential sensitivity to these antagonists, unique restriction endonuclease sites were engineered into cDNAs for each isoform near the regions that encode the putative membrane-spanning domains. These new sites did not modify their pharmacological properties and allowed several chimeric Na+/H+ exchangers to be constructed by exchanging homologous segments. The modified parental (E1' and E3') and chimeric molecules were stably expressed in exchanger-deficient Chinese hamster ovary AP-1 cells and assayed for their sensitivities to amiloride, ethylisopropylamiloride, HOE694, and cimetidine. Most chimeras showed drug sensitivities corresponding to the dominant parental segment. However, interchanging a 66-amino acid segment containing the putative ninth transmembrane (M9) domain and its adjacent loops caused reciprocal alterations in the sensitivities of E1' and E3' to all antagonists. In addition, substituting the first five putative membrane-spanning domains of E3' with the corresponding region of E1' modestly reduced the transporter's sensitivity to cimetidine but not the other compounds. These data indicate that the protein segment between M8 and M10 may be a major site of interaction with these antagonists, although other regions modestly influence sensitivity to certain drugs."

This inhibition by tetrahydrobiopterin is mediated by the GTP cyclohydrolase I feedback regulatory protein GFRP, previously named p35 (Harada, T., Kagamiyama, H., and Hatakeyama, K. (1993) Science 260, 1507-1510), and L-phenylalanine specifically reverses the tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent inhibition. As a first step in the investigation of the physiological role of this unique mechanism of regulation, a convenient procedure has been developed to co-purify to homogeneity both GTP cyclohydrolase I and GFRP from rat liver. GTP cyclohydrolase I and GFRP exist in a complex which can be bound to a GTP-affinity column from which GTP cyclohydrolase I and GFRP are separately and selectively eluted. GFRP is dissociated from the GTP agarose-bound complex with 0.2 M NaCl, a concentration of salt which also effectively blocks the tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent inhibitory activity of GFRP. GTP cyclohydrolase I is then eluted from the GTP-agarose column with GTP. Both GFRP and GTP cyclohydrolase I were then purified separately to near homogeneity by sequential high performance anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. GFRP was found to have a native molecular mass of 20 kDa and consist of a homodimer of 9.5-kDa subunits. Based on peptide sequences obtained from purified GFRP, oligonucleotides were synthesized and used to clone a cDNA from a rat liver cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction-based methods. The cDNA contained an open reading frame that encoded a novel protein of 84 amino acids (calculated molecular mass 9665 daltons). This protein when expressed in Escherichia coli as a thioredoxin fusion protein had tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent GTP cyclohydrolase I inhibitory activity. Northern blot analysis indicated the presence of an 0.8-kilobase GFRP mRNA in most rat tissues, the amounts generally correlating with levels of GTP cyclohydrolase I and tetrahydrobiopterin. Thus, mRNA levels were relatively high in liver and kidney and somewhat lower in testis, heart, brain, and lung.

Potent enzyme inhibitors have long been recognized as powerful tools for assessing the physiological roles of enzymes and have sometimes led to therapeutic drugs able to modulate their activities in vivo (1Sandler M. Smith H.J. Design of Enzyme Inhibitors as Drugs. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). However, to be valuable tools, such inhibitors should also be as selective as possible and not interfere with all of the members of a particular enzyme family. This problem is of particular significance for the inhibitors designed based on enzyme mechanism considerations. This situation applies to the zinc metalloprotease family, for which a general strategy has been to synthesize short peptide sequences containing a particular functional group (thiol, carboxyalkyl, hydroxamate) able to interact with the zinc atom of the active site, while the remaining peptide sequence fits within the enzyme cavity. This traditional approach has led to remarkable results in terms of potency (2Rich D.H. Hansch C. Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry. Pergamon Press, New York1990: 391Google Scholar), but taking into account the rapid expansion of the zinc metalloprotease family (3Stöcker W. Grams F. Bauman U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Rüth F.X. McKay D.R. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Google Scholar), we felt that it would be important to devise a more systematic approach for discovering highly potent and selective inhibitors of these enzymes. For this purpose, we elected to synthesize, by combinatorial synthesis methods, libraries of phosphinic peptides and then screened them with the proteases of interest to find potent and selective inhibitors. Such peptides have been chosen because they were proven to be highly potent inhibitors of several zinc metalloproteases, as expected for good transition state analogues of these enzymes (4Petrillo E.W.

In this previous study, we demonstrated that the systematic substitution by 20 amino acids of the Yaa′ and Zaa′ positions in phosphinic peptides of the general formula Z-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Xaa′-Yaa′-Zaa′, with Xaa′ representing Gly or Ala, led to the identification of an extremely potent inhibitor of 24-15 (Z-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Ala-Arg-Met; Ki = 15 pM), a molecule that is 3 orders of magnitude less potent toward 24-16 (8Jiracek J.

Unfortunately, this approach did not allow the identification of specific inhibitors of 24-16. In fact, in these series of inhibitors, any combination of dipeptides in the Yaa′ and Zaa′ positions of the phosphinic peptides preferred by 24-16 was also well recognized by 24-15. This result led us to increase the molecular diversity of our phosphinic peptide libraries. We demonstrate that potent and specific inhibitors of 24-16 can be obtained through the use of this novel systematic strategy, in which the phosphinic peptide mixtures are generated not only by randomization of the peptide sequence, but also by taking into account the size of the peptide, the position of the phosphinic bond in the sequence, and the state (free or blocked) of their N- or C-terminal extremities. thimet oligopeptidase (EC) neurolysin (EC) and the formula of the group that has replaced this peptide bond is in parentheses benzyloxycarbonyl N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl 7-methoxycoumarin-3-carboxylyl N6-(2, 4-dinitrophenyl)-L-lysine t-butyl t-butyloxycarbonyl triphenylmethyl 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl adamantyl (4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)-phenoxy resin) 2-aminohexanoic acid N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. All of the Fmoc amino acid derivatives, 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, 2-chlorotrityl resin, rink amide resin (4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)-phenoxy resin), and the Mcc-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-DLys(Dnp) were purchased from Novabiochem. The rat brain endopeptidases 24-15 and 24-16 were purified as described previously (17Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Neurochem. Life. Sci. Adv. 1991; 10: 115-124Google Scholar, 10Checler F. Vincent J.P. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11274-11281Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, all assays were performed at 25°C in 5 mM Tricine/NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, in the absence (24-16) or presence (24-15) of 0.1 mM dithiothreitol. Under these conditions, 0.1-1 nM samples of the enzymes retain the same activity for 24 h. Endopeptidase activities were assayed with Mcc-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-D-Lys(Dnp) substrate as described previously (14Dauch P. Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 421-426Google Scholar). Continuous assays were performed by recording the hydrolysis of the quenched fluorescence substrate with a fluorimeter, setting excitation and emission wavelengths at 347 and 405 nm, respectively. In a typical experiment, a cuvette containing 0.9 ml of buffer and 9 µM substrate was brought to thermal equilibrium in a jacketed holder in a compartment of a Perkin Elmer LS 50 luminescence spectrometer cell. The temperature was maintained by water circulating from Haake F3 bath. Injection of 3-30 µl of enzyme (final concentration, 0.1-1 nM) initiated the reaction. In most cases, the steady-state velocities observed with different inhibitor concentrations can be determined from the progress curves before there is significant substrate depletion. Under these conditions, the inhibition constants Ki can be directly determined from Dixon plots. For slow binding inhibitors, progress curves can be fitted to the equation, P=Vst+(V0−Vs)[1−exp(−kappt)]/kapp(Eq. 1) described by Morrison and Walsh to determine V0, Vs, and kapp, where P is the product concentration, V0 is the reaction velocity at t = 0, Vs is the final steady-state velocity, and kapp is the observed first-order rate constant for the approach to steady state (18Morrison J.K. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301Google Scholar). However, as pointed by Morrison and Walsh, relevant values for Vs require that the portion of the progress curve used to determine Vs corresponds to a time long enough to ensure that the equilibrium between the enzyme and the inhibitor has been reached. Some inhibitors in this study display kon values in the range of 103M−1 s−1. In these cases, even at 100 nM inhibitor concentration, the establishment of enzyme-inhibitor complex equilibrium takes about 3 h. Thus, for these inhibitors, to avoid the problem of substrate depletion, the only way to estimate their Ki values is to preincubate them with the enzyme and, only after the equilibrium has been reached, to initiate the reaction by substrate addition. Measurements were made by equilibrating increasing concentrations of inhibitor in 2 ml of solution containing 0.1-1 nM of enzyme overnight or longer, and then initiating the reaction by the addition of 10 µl of substrate. The EI complex concentration can be easily determined by following the resultant enzyme activity. The EI complex dependence on inhibitor concentration makes it possible to determine the Ki value, using the equation, EI=12{(It+Et+Ki+Ki)−[(It+Et+Ki)2−4EtIt]12}(Eq. 2) which takes into account depletion of both enzyme and inhibitor (19Greco W.R. Hakala M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12104-12109Google Scholar, 20Morrison J.K. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 102-105Google Scholar). In this equation, Et and It are known; thus, Ki can be determined by fitting the data with the above equation. Ki and kon values in the range of, respectively, 10 nM and 103M−1 s−1 suggest koff values in the range of 10−5 s−1, a very slow dissociation of the EI complex. In this case, the effect of the substrate addition on the equilibrium position of the EI complex can be neglected. The slow dissociation of such EI complexes has been confirmed by following the recovery of the activity of the EI complexes, which have been purified to remove free inhibitor excess and then diluted with buffer. These solutions were kept at 25°C and assayed periodically for return enzyme activity by combining a 2-ml sample with 5 µl of substrate solution. The return of activity was followed over a 1-day period, and the koff value was estimated by fitting the data to a single exponential. For the determination of the kon values, several progress curves at different inhibitor concentrations were recorded and fitted to Equation 1 by nonlinear least squares analysis. These procedures provide values for the three experimental parameters Vo, Vs, and kapp. kon values were determined by plotting kapp values obtained at different inhibitor concentrations against the inhibitor concentration using the following equation. Kapp=koff+kon(I)/(1+S/Km)(Eq. 3) This equation assumes that the EI complex formation involved a single step (18Morrison J.K. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301Google Scholar). Solid-phase synthesis was performed manually or in a model 357 Advanced ChemTech multiple peptide synthesizer. The side chain protecting groups used were Asp(tBu), Glu(tBu), Ser(tBu), Thr(tBu), Tyr(tBu), Lys(Boc), Trp(Boc), His(Trt), Asn(Trt), Gln(Trt), and Arg(Pmc). The phosphinic pseudodipeptide Z-DL-Phe(PO2CH2)Gly-OEt was prepared as described previously (6Yiotakis A. Lecoq A. Nocolaou A. Labadie J. Dive V. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 323-327Google Scholar). The protection of the hydroxyphosphinyl group by the adamantyl group and the introduction of the Fmoc group will be described elsewhere. 2A. Yiotakis, S. Vassiliou, J. Jiracek & V. Dive, submitted for publication. The protected phosphinic pseudodipeptide Fmoc-DL-Phe(PO(OAd)CH2)Gly-OH was incorporated as a block during the solid phase synthesis. The C-terminal carboxylate peptides were synthesized as described previously, using the 2-chlorotrityl resin (8Jiracek J. Yiotakis A. Vincent B. Lecoq A. Nicolaou A. Checler F. Dive V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21701-21706Google Scholar). Peptides with a C-terminal amide group were synthesized on a rink amide resin. The conditions used for the synthesis of the peptides were those previously described (8Jiracek J. Yiotakis A. Vincent B. Lecoq A. Nicolaou A. Checler F. Dive V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21701-21706Google Scholar). Cleavage of the peptides from the resin, together with the cleavage of the protecting groups, was performed by the action of trifluoroacetic acid containing 2.5% H20, 2.5% thioanisol, 2.5% phenol, 1.25% ethanedithiol, and 1.25% trisopropylsilane. N-terminal acetylation of peptides was performed with acetic anhydride in the presence of diisopropylethylamine. The protocol used to synthesize the various mixtures of phosphinic peptides of the formula Yaa-DL-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Yaa′, where Yaa and Yaa′ represent 20 different natural amino acids (Cys replaced by Nle), was similar to that described previously (8Jiracek J. Yiotakis A. Vincent B. Lecoq A. Nicolaou A. Checler F. Dive V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21701-21706Google Scholar). For the tripeptide mixture of the formula Yaa-DL-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly, the protected phosphinic dipeptide (Fmoc-DL-PheΨ(PO(OAd)CH2)Gly-OH) was coupled to the nonmodified 2-chlorotrityl or rink amide resin. This resin sample was then split into 20 identical samples to which a known amino acid (Yaa) was coupled. All 20 resin samples were then mixed to give a homogeneous mixture of 40 phosphinic tripeptides. In the case of the tripeptide mixture of the formula DL-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Yaa′, the protected phosphinic dipeptide (Fmoc-DL-PheΨ(PO(OAd)CH2)Gly-OH) was coupled to a homogenous mixture of 20 different amino acids (Yaa′), linked to the 2-chlorotrityl or rink amide resin, to give a mixture of 40 phosphinic tripeptides. The L (R configuration) or D (S configuration) stereochemistry of the pseudophenylalanine residue was assigned as described previously (21Yiotakis A. Lecoq L. Vassiliou A. Raynal I. Cuniasse P. Dive V. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 2713-2720Google Scholar). The novel approach developed in this study was devised in an attempt to analyze the effects on the inhibitory potency and selectivity of the size of the phosphinic peptide, the position of the phosphinic bond in the peptide sequence, and the state of the N- and C-terminal extremities of the peptides. Thus, for a given peptide size, the development of different peptide mixtures could be envisaged (see Fig. 1). Due to the binding of the phosphoryl group with the catalytic zinc atom, the interaction of these peptide mixtures will differ according to the number and the nature of the subsites of the enzyme cavity involved in their binding. After this screening step, a further optimization of the potency and the selectivity of these inhibitors could be achieved by the identification of the amino acids improving these two parameters. In the present study, for chemical reasons, the nature of the phosphinic block XaaΨ(PO2CH2)Xaa′ has been kept unique. However, even with this restriction, the development of only tripeptide and tetrapeptide mixtures, as proposed by this strategy, could generate almost 5000 different phosphinic peptides, a molecular diversity expected to be sufficient for disclosing the existence of subtle differences between the active sites of related enzymes. In the present study, using the PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly block, we show that specific inhibitors of 24-16 have been obtained by developing only a subset of all the possible combinations of the proposed approach. Different tripeptide mixtures of the general formula DL-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Yaa′ and Yaa-DL-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly, each containing in the Yaa′ or Yaa positions an equimolar amount of 20 different amino acids, were synthesized as described under “Materials and Methods.” In these mixtures, the N- and C-terminal extremities of the peptides are either free or fully protected. The cases where only one terminus is blocked were also examined. The determination of the relative inhibitory potency of each of the final eight peptide mixtures allowed determination of the preference of both peptidases for phosphinic peptides encompassing the S1 to S2′ subsites (DL-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Yaa′ tripeptides) or the S2 to S1′ subsites (Yaa-DL-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly tripeptides) of these peptidases, independently of the amino acid composition of these peptides. In addition, the preference for a free or protected N- and C terminus was determined in this way. Due to the presence of both the L and D diastereoisomers of the pseudophenylalanine, each mixture contains 40 different peptides. The data in Table I show that when the P2′ position is substituted, only one mixture (1Sandler M. Smith H.J. Design of Enzyme Inhibitors as Drugs. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar), with free N and C termini, displays both inhibitory potency and selectivity for 24-16. The protection of one of the two extremities affects both the affinity and the selectivity, with a more pronounced effect in the case of the N terminus modification. Interestingly, the effect of the protecting groups depends on the actual state of the N- or C-terminal extremity. For example, the acetylation of the N-terminal group reduces the potency of these mixtures for 24-16 by 2 orders of magnitude when the C terminus is free (mixtures 1 and 2), while the same modification has only a weak effect when the C terminus is already blocked (mixtures 3 and 4).Table IInhibitory potency and selectivity of phosphorus-containing tripeptide mixtures of the general formula Yaa-LD-ΨPhe(PO2CH2)Gly and LD-ΨPhe(PO2CH2)Gly-Yaa′ for endopeptidases 24-16 and 24-15InhibitorsIC50 (24-16)IC50 (24-15)SelectivityP2————-P1—————————P1′–P2′µMµMLD-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Yaa′ (1Sandler M.

In these series of tripeptides, the protection of the extremities produces less important changes in the affinity than in the series where the P2′ position is substituted. In addition, the effects of the C- and N-terminal protection apparently depend on subtle rules. For example, the C-terminal protection of mixtures having a free N terminus does not change the affinity of the inhibitors for 24-16 (mixtures 5 and 7). On the other hand, when the N terminus is protected, the same modification of the C terminus gives inhibitors with highly reduced affinity for 24-16 (mixtures 6 and 8). The development of tetrapeptide mixtures was then considered to improve both the inhibitory potency and selectivity of the inhibitors. According to our proposed strategy three different tetrapeptide-type mixtures would have to be developed: 1) Zaa-Yaa-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly, 2) Yaa-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Yaa′, and 3) PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Yaa′-Zaa′. The third type of mixture was not retained at this stage, because we hypothesized that it would give similar results to those obtained with the Z-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Yaa′-Zaa′ mixtures developed previously (8Jiracek J. Yiotakis A. Vincent B. Lecoq A. Nicolaou A. Checler F. Dive V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21701-21706Google Scholar). On the other hand, according to the results reported in Table I, it appears that the presence of a residue in the Yaa′ position is important both for inhibitory potency and selectivity of the peptides toward 24-16. Thus, the second tetrapeptide mixture was first developed. The results in Table I also led us to investigate phosphinic peptides with both free N- and C-terminal extremities. Twenty different peptide mixtures, having the general formula Yaa-DL-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Yaa′, each containing a single amino acid in the Yaa position, while a mixture of 20 different amino acids is present in the Yaa′ position, were synthesized, and their activities were determined both on 24-15 and 24-16. It should be emphasized that the concentration used to test these mixtures was 1 µM and 10 µM for 24-16 and 24-15, respectively, pointing out the better recognition of these mixtures by 24-16. Furthermore, the data in Fig. 2 indicate that the 24-16 S2 subsite has a clear preference for the inhibitor with a proline residue in the P2 position. The preferred amino acids for 24-15 in this position are histidine and arginine. Based on these results, the synthesis of 20 different phosphinic peptides of general formula Pro-DL-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Yaa′ was performed, with Yaa′ representing 20 different amino acids. The influence of the P2′ position on the potency of these inhibitors toward these two endopeptidases is reported in Fig. 3. The concentration of each peptide was 100 nM for 24-16 and 40 µM for 24-15, respectively. Here again, the inhibitor containing a proline in the P2′ position appears the most potent toward 24-16, while those with an arginine or a lysine in this position are preferred by 24-15. The Ki values determined on both peptidases for the Pro-DL-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Pro compound indicate furthermore that this molecule is a potent, but also a specific, inhibitor of the 24-16 (see Table II).Table II.Inhibition constants and selectivity of phosphorus-containing peptides for endopeptidases 24-16 and 24-15Inhibitors P3—P2—–P1———–P1′–P2′–P3′Ki(24-16)Ki(24-15)SelectivitynMnMPro-LD-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Pro (1Sandler M.

Open table in a new tab Six analogues of the Pro-DL-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Pro inhibitor were synthesized and tested to elucidate the effects of the N- and C-terminal protection and the role of additional residues in the P3 and P3′ positions. The data in Table II reveal that both endopeptidases clearly prefer the N-terminal free form of this peptide (compounds 1 and 2), while the protection of the C-terminal carboxylate produces only a small decrease in the affinity for 24-16 and 24-15 (compounds 1-3). With respect to 24-16, the presence of a glycine in the P3 position of the inhibitor decreases the affinity (compound 5). Interestingly, this change is less pronounced than that observed by protecting the N terminus of the proline in the parent inhibitor (compounds 1 and 2). The addition of a norleucine in the P3′ position gives a potent inhibitor of 24-16 (compound 6) but also results in a dramatic increase in the inhibitor affinity for 24-15 (compounds 1-6). Like compound 6, the hexapeptide is a potent mixed inhibitor of the two peptidases. The Pro-L-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Pro, obtained by the resolution of the Pro-DL-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Pro diastereoismer mixture, has a Ki value of 4 nM toward 24-16 and is 3 orders of magnitude less potent on 24-15. The development of a systematic approach based on combinatorial chemistry of phosphinic peptides led us to identify a potent and selective inhibitor of 24-16. The ability of 24-16 to interact specifically with Yaa-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Yaa′ peptides is intriguing, since the importance of the presence of a C-terminal tripeptide from the scissile bond of natural substrates seemed to indicate that a residue in the P3′ position was a strong requirement for 24-16 recognition (10Checler F. Vincent J.P. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11274-11281Google Scholar). In agreement with this, the addition of norleucine in the P3′ position of the inhibitor produces a more potent inhibitor of 24-16 (Table II, compounds 1-6). But as is also shown in this table, the residue in the P3′ position plays a much more crucial role in inhibitor binding for 24-15 than for 24-16. Based on this important result, analysis of the role played by the Yaa and Yaa′ positions in the rather selective Yaa-PheΨ(PO2CH2)Gly-Yaa′ mixture rapidly results in the identification of the preference of the 24-16 S2 and S2′ subsites for proline, as compared with 24-15, leading to the the first potent inhibitor able to discriminate between 24-16 and 24-15. This study also provides evidence for the essential role played by the free amino acid group in the P2 position of the inhibitors in their binding to 24-16. For example, the acetylation of the proline in compound 1 promotes a decrease in affinity of almost 3 orders of magnitude. It should be emphasized that in most of the literature reports, peptide substrates or inhibitors are screened with blocked extremities, because charged extremities are believed to play a repulsive role in the binding of these molecules to the active site of endopeptidases (22Eichler J. Houghten R.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11035-11041Google Scholar, 23Campbell D.A. Bermak J.C. Burkoth T.S. Patel D.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5381-5382Google Scholar). Another important reason to use a systematic approach is related to the possibility of gaining deeper insight into the specificity of these peptidases. The analysis of the effects caused by systematic substitution of a particular position, both in the present and previous study, indicates that among 20 amino acids tested, only a few residues, one or two at most, were greatly preferred over the others. Thus, this restricted number justifies the use of a systematic approach to achieve a proper inhibitor potency and selectivity for a particular target. The specificity of the 24-16 S2 subsite, as revealed by this study, could also explain, a posteriori, why the dipeptides Pro-Ile and Pro-Phe are specific blockers of 24-16 (24Dauch P. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 267-269Google Scholar). In fact, based on our results, one may hypothesize that these peptides interact with the S2 and S1 subsites of 24-16, the specificity of this interaction being ensured by the binding of the free proline to the S2 subsite. This mode of binding will place the C-terminal carboxylate group in the right position to interact with the zinc atom of the active site. This proposal is thus different from the earlier one that suggested that these dipeptides would interact, like the Pro-Tyr moiety of the neurotensin, with the S1 and S1′ subsites of 24-16 (24Dauch P. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 267-269Google Scholar). The specificity of the 24-16 S2 and S2′ subsites for proline is also in good agreement with the report that 24-16 is able to hydrolyze the synthetic substrate Mcc-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-D-Lys(Dnp)OH (14Dauch P. Barelli H. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 421-426Google Scholar). In fact, the cleavage by 24-16 of the peptide bond situated between leucine and glycine implies that the binding of this peptide to the 24-16 active site positions the two prolines in the S2 and S2′ subsites of this enzyme, respectively. It should be recalled that this peptide was designed by analogy with another synthetic substrate called the Pz-peptide (4-phenylazobenzyloxy-carbonyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-D-Arg), developed to assay bacterial collagenase activities (25Wünsh E. Heidrich H.G. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1963; 349: 171-178Google Scholar, 13Tilsjar U. Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 112-115Google Scholar). This peptide has also been used for many years to study a mammalian zinc peptidase, named Pz-peptidase (26Morales T.I. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4855-4860Google Scholar, 27Sakyo K. Kobayashi J.I. Ito A. Mori Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 1913-1923Google Scholar). Several observations suggest that this peptidase plays a role in the late stages of collagen catabolism (26Morales T.I. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4855-4860Google Scholar, 27Sakyo K. Kobayashi J.I. Ito A. Mori Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 1913-1923Google Scholar). Indeed, a high level of this peptidase was found in rheumatoid synovial cells (28Ito A. Hagihara M. Nagatsu T. Iwata H. Miura T. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1987; 170: 291-296Google Scholar). Barrett has proposed the consideration of Pz-peptidase and 24-15 as the same enzyme (29Barrett A.J. Tisljar U. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 1047-1050Google Scholar). The present study, which unveiled an unexpected specificity for the 24-16 S2 and S2′ subsites for proline, may suggest a closer relationship between the Pz-peptidase and 24-16. 3Preliminary work in our laboratory has shown that 24-16 is able to cleave efficiently the free tetrapeptide Pro-Phe-Gly-Pro between phenylalanine and glycine. In this connection, it is important to mention that some authors noted inhibition of Pz-peptidase activity by reducing agents (30Harris E.D. Krane S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 258: 566-576Google Scholar, 31Aswanikumar S. Radhakrisnan A.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 384: 194-202Google Scholar), in disagreement with the known activation of 24-15 by such agents (32Tisljar U. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 531-533Google Scholar). It may be important to reconsider this point. The potent and selective inhibitors now available would clearly be of great value in reassessing the role of 24-16 and 24-15 in this process. These new tools would be also helpful in pursuing our work on the respective contribution of these two peptidases in the catabolism of neurotensin in the central nervous system (7Vincent B. Dive V. Yiotakis A. Smadja G. Maldonado R. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 1053-1063Google Scholar) and particularly to examine the influence of these inhibitors on neurotensin-induced hypothermic and analgesic effects after their central administration. Recently, rat brain 24-16 was sequenced (16Dauch P. Vincent J.P. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27266-27271Google Scholar) and was found to share 90% homology with a zinc peptidase of rabbit liver. According to Kawabata et al., this peptidase may be involved in the processing of vitamin K-dependent proproteins (33Kawabata S. Nakagawa K. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12498-12503Google Scholar, 34Kawabata S. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10331-10336Google Scholar). The rat brain peptidase also presents 90% homology with a zinc peptidase able to bind, under particular conditions, angiotensin II and which was later shown to also display peptidase activity (35Sugiura N. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18067-18072Google Scholar). Serizawa et al. (36Serizawa A. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2092-2098Google Scholar) recently published a study on a 24-16-like peptidase, which is supposed to play an important role at the level of the inner membrane of mitochondria. Without any doubt, the potent and specific inhibitor of 24-16 developed in this study will permit investigation of all these putative functional roles for these 24-16-like peptidases."

Recently, a homologous receptor, the PTH-2 receptor, was obtained from rat and human brain cDNA libraries. This receptor displayed the remarkable property of responding potently to PTH, but not to PTHrP. To begin to define residues involved in the ligand specificity of the PTH-2 receptor, we studied the interaction of several PTH/PTHrP hybrid ligands and other related peptide analogs with the human PTH-2 receptor. The results showed that two sites in PTH and PTHrP fully account for the different potencies that the two ligands exhibited with PTH-2 receptors; residue 5 (His in PTHrP and Ile in PTH) determined signaling capability, while residue 23 (Phe in PTHrP and Trp in PTH) determined binding affinity. By changing these two residues of PTHrP to the corresponding residues of PTH, we were able to convert PTHrP into a ligand that avidly bound to the PTH-2 receptor and fully and potently stimulated cAMP formation. Changing residue 23 alone yielded [Trp23]hPTHrP-(1-36), which was an antagonist for the PTH-2 receptor, but a full agonist for the PTH/PTHrP receptor. Residues 5 and 23 in PTH and PTHrP thus play key roles in signaling and binding interactions, respectively, with the PTH-2 receptor. Receptor-selective agonists and antagonists derived from these studies could help to identify the biological role of the PTH-2 receptor and to map specific sites of ligand-receptor interaction.

Addition of Fe(II) or Fe(II) plus dopamine to the apoenzyme did not significantly modify its secondary structure. However, an increased thermal stability and resistance to proteolysis, as well as a decreased cooperativity in the thermal denaturation transition, was observed for the ligand-bound forms. Thus, as compared with the apoenzyme, the ligand-bound subunits of hTH1 showed a more compact tertiary structure but weaker intersubunit contacts within the protein tetramer. Phosphorylation of the apoenzyme by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase did not change its overall conformation but allowed on iron binding a conformational change characterized by an increase (about 10%) in α-helix and protein stability.

D., Davis, M. G., Houser, W. A., Eubank, J. J., Ritchie, M. E., and Dorn, G. W., II (1995) Circ. Res. 77, 466-474). Herein we report the localization of the PMA response element to a 14-nucleotide C-rich sequence, flanked by an octanucleotide inverted repeat, located −1.938 to −1.925 kb 5′ of the transcription start site of this gene. We further identify the PMA-responsive enhancer factor that binds to this C-rich sequence as Sp1. Heterologous thromboxane receptor gene promoter/thymidilate kinase reporter constructs transfected into K562 cells exhibited PMA responsiveness when the C-rich element was included with additional 3′ sequence from −1.924 to −1.84 kb. However, mutations of the C-rich element that disrupted a GC box located on the inverse strand eliminated PMA responsiveness and, in gel mobility shift assays, eliminated binding of Sp1. PMA treatment of K562 cells significantly increased, by 5-fold, Sp1 binding to the C-rich element and increased both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated Sp1 protein levels by 2-fold. Furthermore, PMA treatment transiently increased Sp1 mRNA levels prior to increasing thromboxane receptor mRNA, suggesting that up-regulation of Sp1 contributes to up-regulation of thromboxane receptors. Finally, we have detected an unidentified K562 nuclear protein that binds specifically to the sense strand of the C-rich sequence overlapping the Sp1 binding site and that, by stabilizing a double stem-loop conformation of this DNA segment, may also play a role in Sp1 regulation of this gene.

We assessed signaling function of αs-WT versus αs-R231H transiently transfected in HEK293 cells. Hormone receptor-dependent stimulation of cAMP accumulation in cells expressing αs-R231H is reduced by ∼75% in comparison to cAMP accumulation in cells expressing αs-WT. A second mutation, αs-R201C, inhibits the GTPase turnoff reaction of αs, thus producing receptor-independent stimulation of cAMP accumulation.

Resistance to the various ddN drugs is directly correlated with mutations in the viral reverse transcriptase (3Richman D.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 149-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,4De Clercq E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the K65R mutation in RT results in viral cross-resistance to 3TC, ddC, and ddI (5Gu Z. Gao Q. Fang H. Salomon H. Parniak M.A. Goldberg E. Cameron J. Wainberg M.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Our recent studies with recombinant RT have shown that the K65R mutation results in a measurable change in the in vitro affinity of the mutant RT for 3TCTP, ddCTP, and ddATP (6Gu Z. Fletcher R.S. Arts E.J. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28118-28122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This altered affinity leads to a significant decrease in chain termination efficiency by each of 3TCTP, ddCTP, and ddATP when present in DNA polymerization reactions catalyzed by K65R RT (7Gu Z. Arts E.J. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2760-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the K65R RT also has a decreased affinity for normal dNTP substrates. Since the intracellular levels of dNTP substrates are “fixed,” averaging about 3 µM (8Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar), the K65R mutation might be expected to result in an attenuation of viral replication. In fact, the K65R mutant HIV-1 replicates with virtually identical efficacy as the wild type (wt) virus (5Gu Z. Gao Q. Fang H. Salomon H. Parniak M.A. Goldberg E. Cameron J. Wainberg M.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that DNA synthesis by recombinant K65R RT is significantly more processive than that catalyzed by the wt enzyme. Our data indicate that this increased processivity is due to a decreased rate of dissociation of template/primer. The increased processivity of the K65R mutant RT may be a compensatory response to the decreased affinity for certain dNTP substrates, enabling normal viral replication kinetics. We conclude that viral cross-resistance to 3TCTP, ddCTP, and ddITP due to the K65R mutation in RT results from the increased processivity of K65R RT coupled with decreased chain termination frequency noted with ddN antivirals. Recombinant wild type and K65R mutant p51 and p66 forms of HIV-1 RT were expressed in Escherichia coli transformed with the plasmids described by Gu et al. (6Gu Z. Fletcher R.S. Arts E.J. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28118-28122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme produced from these plasmids is identical in primary sequence to HIV-IIIB, except for an additional methionine residue at the N terminus that is contributed by the ATG start codon of the expression plasmid. Heterodimeric p51/p66 RT was purified from bacterial lysates using our recently described single step purification protocol (9Fletcher R.S. Holleschak G. Nagy E. Arion D. Borkow G. Gu Z. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. Prot. Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The K65R and wt RT preparations used in the present studies exhibited identical specific activities when assayed using poly(rA)-oligo(dT)12-18 as template/primer (T/P). The heteropolymeric RNA-dependent DNA polymerase T/P was prepared as described (6Gu Z. Fletcher R.S. Arts E.J. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. J. Biol.

[3H]dNTPs, [γ-32P]ATP, [α-35S]dATP, and the DNA sequencing kit Sequenase 2.0 were from Amersham. The homopolymeric T/P poly(rC)-oligo(dG)12-18, poly(dC)-oligo(dG)12-18, poly(rA)-oligo(dT)12-18, and poly(rI)-oligo(dC)12-18, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and high purity unlabeled dNTPs were obtained from Pharmacia. All other reagents were of the highest quality available and were used without further purification. HIV-1 RT DNA polymerase activity was determined in a fixed time assay. Briefly, reaction mixtures (20-100 µl of total volume) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8, 37°C), 60 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, variable amounts of purified recombinant p51/p66 heterodimeric wt or K65R RT, and template/primer. After preincubation at 37°C for 5-10 min, polymerization was initiated by the addition of aliquots of appropriate combinations of dNTP substrates, including a tracer [32P]dNTP, for continuous polymerization experiments, or dNTP plus heparin (final concentration of heparin was 2 mg/ml), for single processive cycle experiments. Reaction assays were incubated at 37°C, then quenched with 500 µl of cold 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate in 10% trichloroacetic acid. After 15 min on ice, the precipitated nucleic acid was filtered on Whatman 934-AH glass fiber filters, washed sequentially with 10% trichloroacetic acid and 95% ethanol, then analyzed by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Assay conditions were similar to those described above, except that the heparin trap was replaced with poly(rA)-oligo(dT)12-18 (50 µg/ml final concentration) in order to facilitate PAGE resolution of products. The 18-nt DNA oligonucleotide primer complementary to the viral PBS was 5′-end labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase as described previously (7Gu Z. Arts E.J. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2760-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The labeled primer was purified by resolution on PAGE followed by excision and elution of the 18-nt product. The labeled primer (80 nM) was annealed to the pHIV-PBS RNA transcript (65 nM). RT (6 nM of p51/p66 heterodimer) was then preincubated with the T/P for 5 min at 37°C before initiation of the reaction by the addition of 50 µM each of the dNTPs ± trap. After various times of incubation at 37°C, aliquots of the reaction mixtures were removed and quenched by mixing with an equivalent volume of sequencing gel loading buffer comprising 98% deionized formamide, 10 mM EDTA, and 1 mg/ml each of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. The samples were heated at 100°C for 5 min, then analyzed by PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gels. Resolved products were visualized by autoradiography (Kodak X-Omat film). Polymerization products were quantitated by densitometry or by excision of polymerization product bands from the gel followed by analysis by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Similar results were obtained with both methods. In some experiments, sequencing reactions were carried out on the pHIV-PBS plasmid used to prepare the RNA template for use as a size marker reference for the various RT polymerization products obtained under continuous and single processive cycle polymerization conditions. We used a template/primer “challenge” assay similar to that described by Dube and Loeb (11Dube D.K. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3605-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out at 20°C in order to slow the reaction sufficiently to enable facile measurement. Reaction assays (50 µl) consisted of 50 mM Tris (pH 8.1, 20°C) containing 60 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 20 µg/ml poly(rI)-oligo(dC)12-18, and wt or K65R RT (0.5-2 nM p51/p66 heterodimer). The concentration of poly(rI)-oligo(dC)12-18 used was about 5 × Km both for wt and for K65R RT. 2G. Borkow, D. Arion, and M. A. Parniak, unpublished observations. Samples were preincubated for 5-10 min to allow formation of the RT-poly(rI)-oligo(dC)12-18 binary complex, then reactions were initiated by the addition of [3H]dCTP (50 µM final concentration). After a 4-min reaction, either buffer or the T/P poly(dC)-oligo(dG)12-18 was added. The final concentration of the poly(dC)-oligo(dG)12-18 challenge was 50 µg/ml, approximately 100 × Km.2 At various times before and after the addition of the poly(dC)-oligo(dG)12-18 challenge, aliquots were withdrawn, quenched with cold 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate in 10% trichloroacetic acid, and processed as described above for the assay of RT DNA polymerase activity. HIV-1 RT catalyzes both RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerization on a variety of homopolymeric and heteropolymeric T/P. The processivity of HIV-1 RT DNA synthesis varied significantly depending on the T/P used (Table I). For example, with wt RT and poly(rA)-oligo(dT)12-18 and poly(rI)-oligo(dC)12-18, dNMP incorporation in the presence of heparin was about 50% that noted in the absence of the polymerization trap, whereas this value was only 10-15% with either poly(rC)-oligo(dG)12-18 or a heteropolymeric RNA T/P.TABLE I.Activity of wt and K65R RT with a variety of template/primers under continuous and single processive cycle conditionsTemplate/primerTotal pmol dNMP incorporated/15 minaValues are the means ± S.D. of at least three determinations.−Heparin+HeparinwtK65RRatio K65R/wtbRatio of total dNMP incorporated by K65R RT compared to that by wt RT.wtK65RRatio K65R/wtcThese assays used a mixture of all four dNTPs (5 µM each) with [α-32P]dCTP as tracer.

Open table in a new tab Our preparations of recombinant wt and K65R RT catalyzed similar amounts of dNMP incorporation under continuous polymerization conditions in the absence of heparin with all of the T/P used (Table I). In contrast, under single processive cycle conditions in the presence of heparin, dNMP incorporation catalyzed by the K65R RT was approximately 20-40% greater than that by the wt enzyme with all T/P except poly(rC)-oligo(dG)12-18, as shown by the K65R/wt ratios presented in Table I. Control experiments showed that addition of the heparin trap prior to initiation of DNA synthesis resulted in less than 2% incorporation of dNMP compared to that under normal assay conditions (data not shown). With an oligodeoxynucleotide primer, reverse transcription on the RNA template derived from pHIV-PBS produces several smaller polymerization products in addition to the expected full-length product (7Gu Z. Arts E.J. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2760-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Arts E.J. Li X. Gu Z. Kleiman L. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14672-14680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Continuous polymerization conditions allow rebinding of RT to a partially extended primer, enabling subsequent elongation of the extended primer. Under these conditions, both wt and K65R RT gave similar polymerization product profiles (Fig. 1A). The rates of full-length product formation by the two enzymes were identical (Fig. 2A). In contrast, under single processive cycle reaction conditions, which prevent rebinding to and re-extension of primer, the synthesis of full-length product by K65R RT was 2-fold greater than that of wt RT (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Variation in formation of full-length polymerization product with time by wt (▾) and K65R (∘) RT under (A) continuous and (B) single processive cycle conditions.

One possibility was an alteration in T/P dissociation from RT. A greater tendency for dissociation of the T/P from wt RT either before or after limited primer extension might result in an apparent decreased processivity of DNA synthesis. We tested this with a “template challenge” assay (11Dube D.K. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3605-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), in which we examined the inhibition of RT-catalyzed polymerization on one homopolymeric T/P following the addition of another non-complementary T/P. As shown in Fig. 3, incorporation of [3H]dCMP into poly(rI)-oligo(dC)12-18 catalyzed by wt RT and by K65R RT did not stop immediately upon addition of excess poly(dC)-oligo(dG)12-18, but rather decreased in a time dependent manner. This decrease in activity followed first-order kinetics (Fig. 3, inset), yielding rate constants of 1.2 min−1 for wt RT and 0.8 min−1 for K65R RT. The competence of the poly(dC)-oligo(dG)12-18 challenge to inhibit polymerization on poly(rI)-oligo(dC)12-18 was tested in control experiments in which both this T/P and poly(rI)-oligo(dC)12-18 were added simultaneously at the beginning of the experiment. Under these conditions, no [3H]dCMP was incorporated into acid-precipitable material during the subsequent incubation period (data not shown). The K65R mutation in the RT gene of HIV-1 confers cross-resistance to ddI, ddC, and 3TC (5Gu Z. Gao Q. Fang H. Salomon H. Parniak M.A. Goldberg E. Cameron J. Wainberg M.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that recombinant K65R RT shows decreased sensitivity to certain ddNTP inhibitors in vitro (6Gu Z. Fletcher R.S. Arts E.J. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28118-28122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This resistance is due in part to decreased chain termination in the presence of ddI, ddC, and 3TC (7Gu Z. Arts E.J. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2760-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The K65R RT also shows a decreased affinity for deoxynucleotide substrates (6Gu Z. Fletcher R.S. Arts E.J. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28118-28122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a mean Km for the four dNTPs of of 3.3 µM compared to 1.4 µM for the wt enzyme (6Gu Z. Fletcher R.S. Arts E.J. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28118-28122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular levels of dNTPs are obviously dependent on cell type, but average 3 µM (8Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). The K65R mutation might therefore be expected to attenuate viral replication. In fact, virus with the K65R mutation in RT replicates with identical efficacy as wild type (wt) virus (5Gu Z. Gao Q. Fang H. Salomon H. Parniak M.A. Goldberg E. Cameron J. Wainberg M.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We have now shown that K65R RT has an increased DNA polymerase processivity in vitro compared to wt enzyme. This increased processivity may be a compensatory mechanism, allowing the drug-resistant K65R mutant virus to overcome the inherent disadvantage of decreased affinity for dNTP substrate, thereby maintaining normal replication capability. The processivity of a DNA polymerase refers to the number of nucleotides added to the nascent DNA chain before the enzyme dissociates from the T/P. Although HIV-1 RT DNA polymerase activity is essentially processive, pausing occurs during the transcription process and results in a variety of smaller polymerization products in addition to the expected full-length product (12Majumdar C. Abbotts J. Broder S. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15657-15665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Huber H.E. McCoy J.M. Seehra J.S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10312-10323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall processivity of polymerization is an obvious function of dNTP concentration (16DeStefano J.J. Buiser R.G. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Under our in vitro single processive cycle reaction conditions, K65R RT consistently synthesized more full-length product compared to wt RT, at all dNTP levels used (data not shown). A major factor in transcriptional pausing is dissociation of RT from the RT·T/P complex (17Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our template/primer challenge experiments, the rate constant for the loss of DNA polymerase activity upon addition of competitor T/P is a direct measure of the rate of dissociation of the T/P complementary to the dNTP used in the experiment. Although the apparent Km for the T/P poly(rI)-oligo(dC)12-18 is essentially identical for wt and K65R mutant RT,2 our data imply that T/P dissociation from K65R RT is about 50% less than that from wt enzyme. This is in good agreement with the difference in polymerization processivity between K65R and wt RT with poly(rI)-oligo(dC)12-18 as T/P (Table I). The increased DNA polymerase processivity shown by the K65R mutant may thus be due to a decreased rate of T/P dissociation. It is interesting to note that another ddC/3TC-resistant mutant RT, M184V, shows decreased processivity compared to wt enzyme (18Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), in contrast to the increased processivity of our ddC/3TC/ddI cross-resistant K65R mutant. The M184V mutation is located in the “palm” subdomain of RT, and may interact with the ribose of the terminal primer nucleotide of the T/P (19Tantillo C. Ding J. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Pauwels R. Andries K. Janssen P.A.J. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In contrast, the K65R mutation occurs in the β3-β4 loop, a highly flexible segment of the “fingers” subdomain of RT that may be involved in dNTP/ddNTP binding (6Gu Z. Fletcher R.S. Arts E.J. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28118-28122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Cheng N. Merrill B.M. Painter G.R. Frick L.W. Furman P.A.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7207-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although others have presented compelling evidence that this segment may be primarily involved in T/P interaction (23Boyer P.J. Tantillo C. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Ding J. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4882-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The enhanced processivity of K65R RT appears to support the latter conjecture. However, the observation that RT polymerase processivity increases after the third or fourth dNMP residue incorporated (12Majumdar C. Abbotts J. Broder S. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15657-15665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Huber H.E. McCoy J.M. Seehra J.S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 20302-20307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is also consistent with a direct correlation between dNTP binding and processivity. Thus, the precise functional role of this region of RT remains equivocal. Further studies are necessary to clarify the function of this RT fingers substructure. Finally, recent studies have indicated that the D67N/K70R/T215Y/K219Q multiple mutations in RT that are associated with high level resistance to 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine confer increased processivity to the mutant RT (25Caliendo A.M. Savara A. An D. DeVare K. Kaplan J.C. D'Aquila R.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2146-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is presently unclear how these data relate to our findings for the K65R enzyme, since the mutations for 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine-resistance occur in two distinct regions of RT. The combination of these mutations might be expected to result in very different functional effects than a single change in any one subdomain of RT. Nonetheless, two of these mutations, D67N/K70R, occur in the same segment as K65R. It would be interesting to determine whether these mutations are the major determinants for the increased processivity of the 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine-resistant mutant RT. We thank Dr. Neerja Kaushik for critical review of the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W2044179656,"Both mammalian cells and Xenopus eggs possess activities for the joining of nonhomologous DNA ends, and such activities may play a major role in double-strand break repair. In order to dissect the biochemical processing of breaks with oxidatively modified ends, vectors containing various site-specific double-strand breaks with 3′-phosphoglycolate termini were constructed and treated with Xenopus egg extracts. These vectors were rejoined by the extracts at rates 30-100 times slower than comparable 3′-hydroxyl vectors. Vectors with blunt or cohesive 3′-phosphoglycolate ends yielded single repair products corresponding to simple phosphoglycolate removal followed by ligation, while a vector with mismatched ends was also rejoined but yielded a mixture of products. Addition of the kinase inhibitors wortmannin and dimethylaminopurine not only blocked rejoining, but also suppressed phosphoglycolate removal, implying an early, essential, kinase-dependent restriction point in the pathway. The results suggest that double-strand breaks with oxidatively modified ends are repaired in Xenopus eggs by a highly conservative and stringently regulated end-joining pathway, in which all biochemical processing of the breaks is contingent on both end alignment and a specific phosphorylation event. Several lines of indirect evidence suggest DNA-dependent protein kinase as a likely candidate for effecting this phosphorylation.

Vectors with blunt or cohesive 3′-phosphoglycolate ends yielded single repair products corresponding to simple phosphoglycolate removal followed by ligation, while a vector with mismatched ends was also rejoined but yielded a mixture of products. Addition of the kinase inhibitors wortmannin and dimethylaminopurine not only blocked rejoining, but also suppressed phosphoglycolate removal, implying an early, essential, kinase-dependent restriction point in the pathway. The results suggest that double-strand breaks with oxidatively modified ends are repaired in Xenopus eggs by a highly conservative and stringently regulated end-joining pathway, in which all biochemical processing of the breaks is contingent on both end alignment and a specific phosphorylation event. Several lines of indirect evidence suggest DNA-dependent protein kinase as a likely candidate for effecting this phosphorylation. Although most if not all organisims are able to rejoin DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination with an intact copy of the damaged sequence (1Resnick M.A. Martin P. Mol. Gen.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1055-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), also possess “end-joining” activities which are capable of rejoining broken DNA ends by mechanisms which do not involve homologous recombination and do not require a duplicate copy of the sequence. In the case of free radical-mediated double-strand breaks, such end-joining is complicated by the presence of fragmented sugars and damaged or missing bases at the termini. All of these damaged DNA moieties must be removed and replaced with normal nucleotides, and the specific manner in which they are processed will likely have important consequences for the fidelity of repair. Here we describe an in vitro system for examining such processing, and present evidence that a wortmannin-sensitive kinase plays a key role in regulating this end-joining pathway. The preparation of 3′-phosphoglycolate-terminated plasmids will be described in detail elsewhere (12Bennett R.A.O. Gu X.-Y. Povirk L.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5′-32P-end-labeled 3′-phosphoglycolate-terminated single-strand fragments 8-11 bases in length were generated by bleomycin treatment of short partial DNA duplexes (13Sander M. Huang S.M.

Plasmid molecules which failed to incorporate the 3′-phosphoglycolate oligomers were eliminated by treatment with T7 DNA polymerase, which acts as a 3′→ 5′ exonuclease only for 3′-hydroxyl-terminated DNA. The remaining 3′-phosphoglycolate-terminated full-length double-stranded DNA was isolated on an agarose gel. base pair(s) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase DNA-dependent protein kinase. Eggs were collected from gonadotropin-induced Xenopus laevis females (NASCO). Following activation with calcium ionophore A23187, extracts were prepared by ultracentrifugation (17Schaal H. Pfeiffer P. Klein M. Gehrmann P. Scheid A. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 124: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and frozen in small aliquots in liquid N2. Kinase inhibitors and okadaic acid were from Sigma. The 3′-phosphoglycolate repair substrates (20 ng) were added to a 20-µl reaction containing 15 µl of egg extract and incubated, usually for 4 h at 13°C. The reaction was terminated by treatment with proteinase K (300 µg/ml, 55°C, 3 h). Samples were extracted with phenol and then with chloroform and ethanol-precipitated. The samples were then treated with either DpnI or with XhoI plus BstXI and electrophoresed on denaturing 22% polyacrylamide gels. Wet gels were subjected to quantitative phosphorimage analysis. In some cases, an aliquot of uncut DNA was transfected into WM1100 (recA) cells by electroporation, and the sequences of the repair joints were determined (18Wang P. Bennett R.A.O. Povirk L.F. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7527-7531PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of either blunt- or cohesive-end 3′-phosphoglycolate substrates (see Fig. 1) in Xenopus egg extracts resulted in a 5- to 20-fold increase in the number of transfectants obtained upon electroporation into Escherichia coli (data not shown), suggesting that the plasmids were recircularized during incubation in the extract. Sequence analysis revealed that nearly all (34/38) of the clones derived from extract-treated blunt-ended molecules retained all bases from both DNA ends, to give a repair joint with a (CG)4 sequence, suggesting a mechanism involving simple phosphoglycolate removal followed by blunt-end ligation (Fig. 1). Nearly all clones (37/39) derived from the cohesive-end substrate had a 2-base-shorter (CG)3 repair joint, consistent with a mechanism involving annealing of the cohesive ends, phosphoglycolate removal, and ligation. Analysis of radiolabeled plasmid by agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed that a small fraction of the blunt-ended 3′-phosphoglycolate substrate, generally 1-10% depending on the substrate and the batch of extract, was converted from linear to nicked circular and supercoiled forms (not shown). In order to examine more directly the processing of a 3′-phosphoglycolate-terminated DNA strand, a substrate was prepared in which one strand was labeled to high specific activity near the 3′-phosphoglycolate terminus (see Fig. 1). By cleaving the repair substrates and products with XhoI and BstXI following incubation in the extracts, it was possible to follow 3′-phosphoglycolate removal and subsequent ligation separately. XhoI releases the unprocessed 3′-phosphoglycolate end as part of a 10- or 12-base fragment; phosphoglycolate removal can then be detected as a slight decrease in the mobility of this fragment on a sequencing gel, and fill-in of the recessed end as conversion of the 10-base fragment to 11- and 12-base fragments. Recircularization of the plasmid produces a 39-base XhoI/BstXI fragment for blunt-end ligation (Fig. 1D) or a 37-base fragment for cohesive-end ligation (Fig. 1E). These experiments (Fig. 2) showed unequivocally that a fraction of the initially 3′-phosphoglycolate-terminated DNA strands in each of the vectors was ligated to the opposite end of the break, but with much lower efficiency than a strand with a 3′-hydroxyl terminus. The cohesive- and blunt-ended 3′-phosphoglycolate vectors each yielded predominantly a single 37- or 39-base recircularization product, as predicted from sequencing studies. The cohesive-end vector also yielded trace amounts of an 18-base fragment, presumably resulting from intermolecular “head-to-head” joins (Fig. 1F). For both substrates, phosphoglycolate termini were surprisingly persistent, with ≥85% remaining unaltered after 4 h of incubation in the extracts (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). (Phosphoglycolates on single-strand break ends were quantitatively removed within 4 h; data not shown.) Vectors from which the 3′-phosphoglycolates had been removed by treatment with human abasic endonuclease (gift of B. Demple and D. M. Wilson) (19Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11450-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) were much more efficiently rejoined (70% recircularized within 30 min; data not shown), indicating that the low efficiency of end-joining was due solely to the presence of blocked 3′ ends.Fig. 3Quantitative analysis of the effect of kinase inhibitors on phosphoglycolate removal and end-joining. Data in A through D are derived from phosphorimage analysis of the experiments in Fig. 2 using blunt- (A), cohesive- (B), or mixed-end (C) 3′-phosphoglycolate vectors, or a blunt 3′-hydroxyl vector (D). E is a replicate experiment with the mixed-end vector. F, G, and H represent additional experiments with the blunt 3′-hydroxyl vector, with incubation for 10, 30, and 90 min, respectively, at 13°C. I and J represent similar experiments (90-min incubations) with vectors having 3′-hydroxyl ends and either 2-base (CG) (I) or 4-base (CGCG) (J) cohesive 5′ overhangs. These were generated by cleavage of pSV56 with BsaHI or MluI, respectively, followed by 5′-end-labeling; analysis was as in Fig. 2. The dimethylaminopurine concentration was 2.5 mM in all cases. The wortmannin concentration was 2 µM or 10 µM (*). In all cases, the fraction rejoined represents the sum of all end-joined products divided by the total radiolabel in each lane. Since removal of 3′-phosphoglycolates must necessarily precede rejoining, the percent phosphoglycolate removal is calculated as the sum of all free 3′-hydroxyl ends plus the sum of all end-joined products, divided by the total radiolabel in the lane. DMAP = dimethylaminopurine; ND = not done.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For a vector having mixed incompatible 3′-phosphoglycolate ends, one blunt and one with a 2-base 5′ overhang (Fig. 1C), significant amounts of both the 37- and the 39-base recircularization products, as well as of the 18-base intermolecular cohesive-end-joining product, were formed (Fig. 2C). Formation of the 39-base product implies that the recessed 3′ end had been filled in prior to ligation, while formation of the 37-base product implies that the 5′ overhang either had been removed or had displaced two bases of the 3′ terminus on the blunt end of the break. Most strikingly, however, the intermediate processing of the recessed 3′-phosphoglycolate terminus was much different for the mixed-end than for the cohesive-end vector (Figs. 2, B and C, and 3, B, C, and E). While the fraction of total ligated repair products was similar, the extent of 3′-phosphoglycolate removal was significantly greater for the mixed-end vector. Moreover, the mixed-end vector allowed both the accumulation of unligated 3′-hydroxyl intermediates, and partial fill-in of the 5′ overhang, while the cohesive-end vector did not. These marked differences in processing of the same recessed 3′-phosphoglycolate end suggest that alignment of the opposite ends of the break must have preceded biochemical modification of the termini. Kinetic studies (Fig. 4A) showed that the joining of terminally blocked substrates was 30-100 times slower than joining of a substrate with normal 3′-hydroxyl termini. Nevertheless, extended incubation resulted in ligation of a significant fraction (up to 25%) of the terminally blocked DNA strands, implying that end-joining was not restricted to some minor contaminant in the preparation. To assess the possible role of protein phosphorylation in regulation of end-joining, reactions were performed in the presence of kinase and phosphatase inhibitors. Wortmannin inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK), and certain PIK-related protein serine-threonine kinases (20Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kumura K. Hanai H. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y.

Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 37-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, wortmannin (2 µM) as well as the broad-specificity kinase inhibitor dimethylaminopurine (2.5 mM) not only dramatically reduced end-joining of terminally blocked substrates, but also strongly inhibited phosphoglycolate removal. This was most apparent with the blunt and mixed-end vectors, where free 3′-hydroxyl termini (12-mer and 10-mer bands in Fig. 2, A and C) accumulated in control (lanes 1, 7, and 8) but not in inhibitor-containing samples (lanes 2 and 5). While the extent of both end-joining and phosphoglycolate removal differed for different substrates and different batches of extract, the suppression by the kinase inhibitors was quite reproducible (Fig. 3). Dimethylaminopurine and wortmannin also suppressed the joining of both blunt- and cohesive-end breaks bearing 3′-hydroxyl termini (Fig. 3, D and F-J), and this suppression was expressed within 10 min of inhibitor addition. Half-maximal suppression of rejoining required 0.1-0.3 µM wortmannin (Fig. 4, B and C), comparable to values reported for inhibition of wortmannin-sensitive protein kinases (20Yano H. Nakanishi S.

H7 had no effect on end-joining of any of the substrates. Thus, the results suggest that the end-joining pathway requires a specific phosphorylation event, catalyzed by a PIK-related or other wortmannin-sensitive kinase, as a prerequisite to all biochemical processing of double-strand break ends, blocked or unblocked. Effects of the broad-specificity phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid were complex and less definitive. It had no effect on joining of a 3′-hydroxyl-terminated vector, but it did partially inhibit joining of phosphoglycolate-terminated vectors. It has long been postulated that double-strand break repair in higher eukaryotes may be carried out at least in part by simple end-joining rather than by homologous recombination (24Resnick M.A. Moore P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 3145-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Jeggo P.A. Mutat. Res. 1990; 239: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recently, support for this hypothesis has come from the discovery that in mammalian cells DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK, a PIK-related kinase) and its essential cofactor, the DNA end-binding heterodimer Ku, are required both for efficient repair of radiation- and bleomycin-induced double-strand breaks and for ostensibly similar end-joining events which occur during V(D)J recombination (26Taccioli G.E.

Although the extent of overlap between this putative mammalian end-joining repair system and the end-joining activity detected in Xenopus egg extracts is unknown, the present results show that the Xenopus system, like its mammalian counterpart, involves a wortmannin-sensitive kinase, and is capable of processing DNA breaks with oxidatively modified ends. The apparent presence of DNA-PK activity in Xenopus egg extracts (33Walker A.I. Hunt T. Jackson R.J. Anderson C.W. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), its known association with DNA ends, and its sensitivity to dimethylaminopurine (34Labhart P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2934-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), are consistent with its being a participant in end-joining. Half-maximal inhibition of protein phosphorylation by isolated human DNA-PK requires 0.1-0.25 µM wortmannin (21Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Less-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), similar to concentrations required to inhibit end-joining in vitro (Fig. 4, B and C). These data are clearly more compatible with involvement of a wortmannin-sensitive protein kinase than of PIK itself, which is inhibited at ∼100-fold lower concentrations of wortmannin (20Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kumura K. Hanai H. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, several PIK-related kinases have been linked to DNA damage/repair responses (35Keith C.T. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 50-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), and it is certainly possible that the wortmannin sensitivity of end-joining in Xenopus egg extracts may reflect involvement of a kinase(s) other than DNA-PK. Analysis of end-joining events in both Xenopus egg extracts and mammalian cells has suggested a model wherein DNA ends are first aligned (often on the basis of partial complementarities in 5′ or 3′ overhangs), then trimmed and patched as necessary to produce a ligatable substrate (4Roth D.B. Wilson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4295-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 9Pfeiffer P. Thode S. Hancke J. Vielmetter W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 888-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The present results further suggest that at least in the Xenopus system, not only patching and ligation, but also removal of 3′-terminal blocking groups, are all stringently regulated by phosphorylation. Since terminal processing seems to be also dependent on prior completion of the end alignment step (Fig. 2), we speculate that perhaps the wortmannin-sensitive phosphorylation event is contingent on end alignment, and that one of its functions may be to delay biochemical processing of the DNA ends until they have been optimally aligned. Since free radical-mediated double-strand breaks will often have staggered ends with missing bases and damaged termini, the capacity to use partial complementarities for such alignment, along with the capacity to remove and replace fragmented as well as mismatched nucleotides (apparently without disturbing end alignment), makes the Xenopus system seem ideally suited for repair of these complex lesions. Whether end-joining of double-strand breaks in mammalian chromosomal DNA is carried out by a similar mammalian homologue of this system, remains to be determined; however, the finding that the Xenopus pathway can be arrested in vitro, by kinase inhibitors and by modified DNA ends, should greatly improve prospects for isolation of an intact, active end-joining complex, and for definitive identification of its constituents."

Purification of hTFIID by chromatography and/or sequential immunoprecipitation with antibodies against TBP and hTAFII30 identified two TFIID populations, TFIIDα and TFIIDβ, which lack or contain hTAFII30, respectively (21Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Analysis of the TAFII composition of the TFIIDα and TFIIDβ complexes led us to propose the existence of core hTAFIIs (exemplified by hTAFII250, hTAFII135, hTAFII100, and hTAFII28), present in all TFIID complexes, and specific hTAFIIs (exemplified by hTAFII30, hTAFII20, and hTAFII18), present in only a subset of TFIID complexes (21Jacq X.

More recently, yeast homologues of the metazoan TAFIIs have been identified, and analysis of their sequence shows that the TAFIIs have been highly conserved during evolution (30Reese J.C. Aponne L. Walker S.S. Griffen L.A. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 31Poon D. Bai Y. Cambell A.M. Björklund S. Kim Y.L. Zhou S. Kornberg R.D. Weil P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8224-8228Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Comparison of Drosophila and human TAFIIs indicates that, in general, the carboxyl-terminal regions are much better conserved than the amino-terminal regions (22Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Dubrovskaya V. Lavigne A.-C. Davidson I. Acker J. Staub A. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, several human TAFIIs (hTAFII30, hTAFII18, and hTAFII55) have no known Drosophila counterparts. The isolation of cDNAs encoding the TAFIIs has facilitated the study of TAF-TAF and TAF-TBP interactions and the reconstitution of TFIID complexes using recombinant proteins. Comparison of TAF-TAF and TAF-TBP interactions observed with recombinant hTAFIIs or dTAFIIs indicates considerable similarities, but also some notable differences. For example, hTAFII28 interacts with TBP both in vitro and in transfected COS cells (22Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whereas no analogous interaction was observed with its Drosophila homologue, dTAFII30β (24Yokomori K. Chen J.L. Admon A. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2587-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similarly, hTAFII100 interacts with TBP and can be stably incorporated into a partial TFIID complex with hTAFII250 and TBP (29Dubrovskaya V. Lavigne A.-C. Davidson I. Acker J. Staub A. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), whereas contradictory results concerning its Drosophila homologue, dTAFII80, have been reported. Dynlacht et al. (32Dynlacht B.D. Weinzierl R.O.J. Admon A. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 363: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) observed that dTAFII80 did not interact with dTBP and could only be incorporated into dTFIID following assembly of a dTAFII250-dTAFII110-dTAFII60-dTBP complex, while Kokubo et al. (33Kokubo T. Gong D.W. Yamashita S. Takada R. Roeder R.G. Horikoshi M. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7859-7863Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) detected direct interactions between dTAFII80 and TBP. These results highlight potential differences in the organization of dTFIID and hTFIID that may either be due to the different experimental protocols used or reflect real differences between dTFIID and hTFIID related to the presence of at least three additional TAFIIs in hTFIID. Based on the observation that transactivation was supported by TFIID, but not TBP (11Zhou Q. Lieberman P.M. Boyer T.G. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 13Brou C. Chaudhary S. Davidson I. Lutz Y. Wu J. Egly J.M. Tora L. Chambon P.

Peterson M.G. Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1179-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), it was proposed that some TAFIIs may act as coactivators. This was first confirmed by Hoey et al. (23Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), who showed that direct interaction between the transactivator Sp1 and dTAFII110 was required for transactivation in vitro. Subsequently, several studies confirmed our initial proposal (13Brou C. Chaudhary S. Davidson I. Lutz Y. Wu J. Egly J.M. Tora L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Brou C. Ali S. Wu J. Scheer E. Lang C. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that, depending on the nature of their activation domain, transactivators interact selectively and directly with different TAFIIs to activate transcription in vitro (21Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 28Klemm R.D. Goodrich J.A. Zhou S. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

However, TAFIIs such as dTAFII150 and its putative human counterpart, CIF, may also play a role in promoter recognition (39Verrijzer P. Yokomori K. Chen J.L. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 264: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 40Verrijzer P. Chen J.L. Yokomori K. Tjian R.

In addition, the ability of some TAFIIs to adopt a histone-like fold structure suggests that they also play a role in modeling DNA architecture around the promoter (42Xie X. Kokubo T. Cohen S.L.

We have characterized the roles played by hTAFII30 and hTAFII28 in the activation of transcription by members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (21Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P.

We have shown that ligand-independent transactivation in vitro by the estrogen receptor involves direct interactions between the AF-2a domain, which is present in α-helices H1 and H2 of the estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain (21Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 52Wurtz J.M. Bouguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) and which is also active in yeast, and hTAFII30 (53Pierrat B. Heery D. Chambon P. Losson R. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 143: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have also shown that coexpression of hTAFII28 potentiates ligand-dependent transactivation by the RXR, the estrogen receptor, and the vitamin D3 receptor in transfected COS cells (44May M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.-C. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3093-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The coactivator activity of hTAFII28 does not require direct hTAFII28-receptor ligand-binding domain interactions, but requires hTAFII28-TBP interaction. These results show that hTAFII28 probably acts as a bridging factor between the transcriptional intermediary factors associated with the ligand-binding domains and the basal transcription factors via its interaction with TBP. These results highlight the important role that hTAFIIs may play in transcriptional regulation in mammalian cells. In this study, we describe the properties of hTAFII55. We show that hTAFII55 is present in TFIIDα, but is mainly associated with TFIIDβ. hTAFII55 interacts with hTAFII250, hTAFII100, hTAFII28, hTAFII20, and hTAFII18, but not with hTAFII30 or TBP. Although it does not interact with TBP, hTAFII55 can be incorporated into stable ternary complexes comprising TBP and hTAFII250, hTAFII100, or hTAFII28 to form partial TFIID complexes. Furthermore, tagging hTAFII55 with hTAFII18 generates a fusion protein that can interact with TBP. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared and purified on heparin-Ultrogel as described. TFIID was immunopurified using the anti-TBP mAb 2C1 and eluted with a peptide containing the 2C1 epitope. TFIID was concentrated, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described previously. The hTAFII55 subunit was excised and digested with trypsin. Four tryptic peptides were obtained: AVQSGHVNLK, LTIELHPDGR, LLSTDAEAVSTR, and WEIIAEDETK. Based on these sequences, degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized (5′-GC(C/T)GT(C/G)CA(A/G)(T/A)(G/C)(C/T)GG(A/C/G/T)CA(C/T)GT(C/G)AA(C/T)(C/T)T(C/G)AA-3′, 5′-AC(A/C/T)AT(C/T)GA(A/G)CT(C/G/T)CA(C/T)CC(A/C/T)GA(C/T)AT-3′, 5′-AC(A/C/T)GA(C/T)GC(C/T)GA(A/G)GC(C/T)GT(C/G)(T/A)(C/G)(C/T)(A/C)(A/C/T)(C/A)G-3′, and 5′-GA(A/G)GA(A/G)AT(C/T)AT(C/T)GC(C/T)GA(A/G)GA(C/T)GA(A/G)AC(A/C/T)(C/A)G-3′) and used to screen a HeLa cell random-primed cDNA library as described. Seven clones hybridizing to two or more probes were isolated and sequenced on both strands using an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer. The resulting data were analyzed using the Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis programs. The complete open reading frame of hTAFII55 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a cDNA clone using primers with BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. The resulting fragment was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pXJ41. GST-hTAFII55 was constructed by PCR amplification with primers containing BamHI sites and cloning into the BamHI site of pGEX2T. B10-tagged hTAFII55 was constructed by PCR amplification with primers containing SpeI sites and cloning into the NheI site of pAT6. The hTAFII55-hTAFII18 fusion construct was constructed by ligating three fragments, a PCR fragment containing the entire hTAFII55 coding sequence with BamHI and XhoI restriction sites, a XhoI-PstI restriction fragment containing the hTAFII18 coding sequence, and BamHI-PstI-digested pXJ41. The sequences of all constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. The rationale for the construction of hTAFII28-(1-179)-M1 stems from computer predictions using the Chou and Fasman algorithm in the Genetics Computer Group software package and using the PHD program (EMBL), which indicated that amino acids 161-179 (FVGEVVEEALDVCEKWGEM) of hTAFII28 had the potential to form an amphipathic α-helix with a highly hydrophobic face (underlined) and a hydrophilic face where 6 out of the 7 amino acids (with the exception of K175) are acidic (shown in boldface). In hTAFII28-(1-179)-M1, Glu-164, Glu-167, and Glu-168 were mutated to Pro, Pro, and Arg, respectively, both changing the charge and disrupting the putative α-helix (44May M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.-C. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3093-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The other hTAFII and TBP expression vectors are as described previously (22Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Dubrovskaya V. Lavigne A.-C. Davidson I. Acker J. Staub A. Tora L.

Monoclonal antibodies against hTAFII55 were prepared essentially as described previously (22Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-hTAFII55 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Mice were injected intraperitoneally three times at 2-week intervals with 200 µg of GST-hTAFII55. Following fusion of spleen cells, the hybridoma culture supernatants were screened by immunofluorescence on COS cells transfected with pXJ41-hTAFII55. Monoclonal antibodies against TBP (3G3), hTAFII18 (16TA), hTAFII20 (22TA), hTAFII28 (15TA), hTAFII30 (4G2 and 2F4), and the B10 tag were prepared as described previously (21Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 22Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I.

EMBO J. 1992; 6: 2229-2240Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). GST-hTAFII55 was overexpressed and purified from E. coli by standard procedures on glutathione-Sepharose. Native recombinant hTAFII55 was prepared by immobilizing GST-hTAFII55 on glutathione-Sepharose and adding thrombin (1/400 of the GST-hTAFII55 mass). Digestion was performed by resuspending the glutathione-Sepharose-immobilized GST-hTAFII55 in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1.0 mM dithiothreitol) containing 0.1 M KCl and 2.5 mM CaCl2 for 2 h at room temperature. The column was then allowed to elute, and the effluent was collected. The recombinant protein was >80% pure as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. COS cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique, and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (22Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Dubrovskaya V. Lavigne A.-C. Davidson I. Acker J. Staub A. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 44May M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.-C. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3093-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 48 h following transfection, the cells were harvested by three cycles of freeze-thawing in buffer A containing 0.5 M KCl. Expression of the transfected proteins was verified on Western blots. For immunoprecipitations, the cell extracts were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 1-2 µg of the indicated monoclonal antibodies, after which time 50 µl of protein G-Sepharose was added, and incubation was continued for another 2 h. The protein G-Sepharose was then washed four times for 10 min at room temperature with buffer A containing 1.0 M KCl and once with buffer A containing 0.1 M KCl. The resin was resuspended in loading buffer containing SDS, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The bound proteins were detected on Western blots with the indicated antibodies using an ECL kit (Amersham Corp.). HeLa cell nuclear extracts were fractionated on a heparin-Ultrogel column, and total TFIID was immunoprecipitated from the 0.6 M KCl fraction using the anti-TBP mAb 3G3. TFIID was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the 55-kDa subunit was excised and digested with trypsin. The sequences of four tryptic peptides were obtained, and degenerate oligonucleotides based on these sequences were used to screen a HeLa cell cDNA library. Several overlapping clones hybridizing to more than one of the oligonucleotides were isolated and sequenced. The hTAFII55 cDNA sequence deduced from these clones comprises an open reading frame encoding a protein of 349 amino acids preceded by a long 5′-untranslated region (at least 723 nucleotides) (Fig. 1A). Each of the four tryptic peptide sequences was found in the open reading frame (underlined in Fig. 1A). On Northern blots, a single mRNA species of ∼2.4 kilobase pairs was detected in several human embryonic tissues (Fig. 1B) and in a variety of human cell lines (data not shown). Thus, the deduced nucleotide sequence in Fig. 1A corresponds to the almost complete cDNA. Interestingly, the sequence of hTAFII55 shows no homology to any of the known Drosophila TAFIIs. This observation, together with those of previous studies, confirms that hTFIID comprises three hTAFIIs (hTAFII18, hTAFII30, and hTAFII55), with no known Drosophila homologues. The hTAFII55 open reading frame was fused to the GST protein and expressed in E. coli. The purified fusion protein was injected into mice to generate mAb 19TA. mAb 19TA specifically recognizes hTAFII55 in total TFIID immunopurified with mAb 3G3 (Fig. 2A, lane 1). When mAb 19TA was used to reimmunoprecipitate total hTFIID, both hTAFII55 and TBP were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1-3 with lanes 4-6). This confirms that the isolated cDNA encodes a bona fide hTAFII. However, a significant fraction of hTAFII55 and TBP remained in the supernatant, indicating that not all of the hTAFII55 present in TFIID reacted with mAb 19TA (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 5). As mAb 19TA efficiently precipitated recombinant hTAFII55 (see below and data not shown), this suggests that the corresponding epitope is partially hidden in the TFIID complex. We have previously shown that hTFIID can be separated by immunoprecipitation with an antibody directed against hTAFII30 into two populations, hTFIIDα and hTFIIDβ, either lacking or containing hTAFII30, respectively (Fig. 2B) (21Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 22Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Total TFIID was reimmunoprecipitated with the hTAFII30 antibody (mAb 2F4), and the presence of hTAFII55 in the TFIIDα and TFIIDβ fractions was determined by Western blotting with mAb 19TA. Both hTAFII55 and hTAFII30 were detected in the total TFIID fraction (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 4). Reimmunoprecipitation with the mAb against hTAFII30 generated the TFIIDα fraction, which was almost completely devoid of hTAFII30, and the TFIIDβ fraction, which contained hTAFII30 (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, hTAFII55 was detected in both the TFIIDα and TFIIDβ fractions, although it is preferentially associated with TFIIDβ (Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6). To systematically characterize the interactions of hTAFII55 with the other TFIID subunits, native hTAFII55 or derivatives of hTAFII55 tagged with the B10 epitope of the estrogen receptor (22Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 54Ali S. Lutz Y. Bellocq J.-P. Chenard-Neu M.-P. Rouyer N. Metzger D. Hybridoma. 1993; 12: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were coexpressed in COS cells with native or B10-tagged derivatives of other TFIID subunits. Using this technique, we have previously characterized TAF-TAF and TAF-TBP interactions (22Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Dubrovskaya V. Lavigne A.-C. Davidson I. Acker J. Staub A. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that these interactions occur intracellularly as efficient coimmunoprecipitation was only observed when the target proteins were coexpressed, but not when extracts from independently transfected cells were mixed together (Ref. 22Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar; for hTAFII55, data not shown). It is also likely that the overexpressed proteins interact directly rather than indirectly via interactions with endogenous COS TAFIIs, which are much less abundant than the overexpressed proteins and are already stably associated in endogenous COS cell TFIID (see also below). Furthermore, we have previously noted TAF-TAF interactions in transfected COS cells that were not observed in vitro, e.g. hTAFII28-hTAFII20 (22Mengus G. May M. Jacq X. Staub A. Tora L. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Following transfection, the cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with mAbs directed against TBP, the hTAFIIs, or the B10 tag, and"

https://openalex.org/W2057295985,"We have carried out structure-function studies on the cytoplasmic membrane protein, SecE, a component of the Escherichia coli secretion machinery. SecE, along with SecY, form a complex in the cytoplasmic membrane essential for protein translocation. By directed mutagenesis, we altered highly conserved residues of the second cytoplasmic domain (CD2) and of the COOH-terminal periplasmic region (PD2) of SecE. These mutants, as well as previously constructed mutations in the third membrane-spanning segment of SecE (MSS3), were tested for their ability to complement a secE null mutation, for their effects on protein export in vivo, and for their ability to form a stable complex with SecY. Most single mutations at the conserved positions in CD2 caused secretion defects, but had little effect on growth at 37°C. Double mutations in CD2, or the introduction or removal of proline residues, affected growth and protein translocation more severely. Co-immunoprecipitations of SecE and SecY revealed that all mutant proteins, except those altered in PD2, destabilized the SecE-SecY complex. These results suggest that several regions contribute to the formation of a stable SecE-SecY complex but the elimination of a single contact point does not necessarily affect the functionality of the complex.

INTRODUCTIONA number of features of protein secretion are conserved among prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Extracytoplasmic proteins are usually synthesized with structurally and functionally similar NH2-terminal signal sequences (1Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar, 2Inouye H. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1977; 74: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition, the core translocation machineries in these different organisms share a specific pair of membrane-imbedded proteins that appears to be central to the facilitation of passage of proteins through the membrane (4Hartmann E. Sommer T. Prehn S. Gorlich D. Jentsch S. Rapoport T. Nature. 1994; 367: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The SecE and SecY proteins of Escherichia coli and other bacteria are homologues or analogues of similar proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in mammals (4Hartmann E. Sommer T. Prehn S. Gorlich D. Jentsch S. Rapoport T. Nature. 1994; 367: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 5Murphy C.K. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2557-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SecE and SecY, as well as their mammalian counterparts Sec61α and Sec61γ have been isolated as a complex (6Hartmann E. Gorlich D. Kostka S. Otto A. Kraft R. Knespel S. Burger E. Rapoport T.A. Prehn S. Eur. J. Bioch. 1993; 214: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and genetic evidence for the interaction of the yeast homologues, Sec61p and Sss1p, has also been obtained (7Esnault Y. Feldheim D. Blondel M.-O. Schekman R. Képès F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27478-27485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the complexes from mammals and from E. coli are essential for the translocation of polypeptides into reconstituted proteoliposomes (6Hartmann E. Gorlich D. Kostka S. Otto A. Kraft R.

These proteins may constitute a hydrophilic pore in the lipid bilayer that allows translocation to take place (10Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 677-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A third membrane protein, SecG, found associated with the SecE-SecY complex in E. coli (11Hanada M. Nishiyama K. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23625-23631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), may be a functional homologue of Sec61β and Sbh1p, third membrane components of the mammalian and yeast machinery, respectively (6Hartmann E.

Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 8145: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In addition to these shared features, bacteria express cellular components that are homologous to subunits of the eukaryotic signal recognition particle (13Miller J.D. Bernstein H.D. Walter P. Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These molecules have been proposed to contribute to the targeting of some exported proteins to the translocation machinery (14Wolin S.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 787-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Genetic studies suggest that the SecE and SecY proteins are essential for E. coli viability, while SecG, as well as the two membrane components, SecD and SecF, are only essential under certain growth conditions (15Schatz P.J. Bieker K.L. Ottemann K.M. Silhavy T.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Nishiyama K. Hanada M. Tokuda H.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In this paper we have focused on the two essential proteins, SecE and SecY. Certain mutations in secE and secY result in very severe defects in protein export (15Schatz P.J. Bieker K.L. Ottemann K.M. Silhavy T.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19Ito K. Wittekind M. Nomura M. Shiba K. Yura T. Miura A. Nashimoto H. Cell. 1983; 32: 789-797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Another class of mutations in these genes, the prlA mutations in secY and the prlG mutations in secE, alter the secretion machinery so that proteins with defective, or missing, signal sequences can be exported (20Emr S.D. Hanley-Way S. Silhavy T.J. Cell. 1981; 23: 79-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 21Stader J. Gansheroff L.J. Silhavy T.J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Considerable evidence indicates that SecE, SecY, and SecG form a complex in the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane. The three membrane components can be co-purified or co-immunoprecipitated with an antibody to each of the proteins from solubilized membrane preparations (9Brundage L. Fimmel C.J. Mizushima S. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4166-4170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hanada M. Nishiyama K. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23625-23631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, while SecY is ordinarily unstable when overproduced, co-overexpression of SecE stabilizes the protein (22Matsuyama S. Akimaru J. Mizushima S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The synthetic lethality of combinations of certain prlA and prlG alleles has also suggested an interaction between SecE and SecY (23Flower A.M. Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Studies on the topology of these two proteins indicate that SecY has 10 membrane-spanning segments, while SecE has three (see Fig. 1) (15Schatz P.J. Bieker K.L. Ottemann K.M. Silhavy T.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 24Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).SecE is an attractive subject for genetic structure-function studies because of its small size. We have shown that much of SecE is not essential for its function. Deletion of the first two membrane spanning segments, or of much of the carboxyl-terminal periplasmic domain, does not eliminate the ability of the constructs to complement a secE null mutation (15Schatz P.J. Bieker K.L. Ottemann K.M. Silhavy T.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Nishiyama K. Mizushima S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7170-7176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From our genetic studies, we have concluded that the features of SecE that are essential for its function are 1) a distal portion of the second cytoplasmic domain (CD2), which includes a sequence motif highly conserved among prokaryotes (Fig. 1) and 2) the membrane spanning segment (MSS3) following CD2 (5Murphy C.K. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2557-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The specific sequence of MSS3 appears not to be essential for SecE function, since an unrelated membrane spanning segment can substitute for MSS3 without eliminating the activity of the protein (5Murphy C.K. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2557-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, there is an aspartic acid residue in the second periplasmic domain that is conserved in all bacterial homologues of secE (5Murphy C.K. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2557-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In order to further define the essential residues of SecE, we have mutagenized a number of the conserved residues of this protein and analyzed the effects of these mutations on several aspects of SecE function.

https://openalex.org/W2051035135,"Treatment of the yeast vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (H+-ATPase) with 300 mM KI in the presence of 5 mM MgATP results in a 90% inhibition of ATPase activity accompanied by removal of at least five of the peripheral subunits of the enzyme from the membrane. Functional reassembly of the enzyme, as indicated by reattachment of the peripheral subunits and a partial (30-70%) recovery of ATPase activity, could be achieved by dialysis of the stripped wild-type membranes to remove the KI and MgATP, but proved to be strongly pH-dependent, with optimal reassembly and recovery of activity occurring after dialysis at pH 5.5. Vacuolar membranes isolated from vma2Δ mutants, which lack one of the peripheral subunits of the enzyme, do not contain any of the peripheral subunits but are shown to contain assembled membrane (Vo) complexes. The vma2Δ mutant vacuoles are demonstrated to be competent for attachment of KI-stripped peripheral subunits and reactivation of ATPase activity. The results indicate that previously assembled Vo complexes are capable of inducing assembly of the peripheral subunits, both with each other and with the membrane subunits, and of activating the ATPase activity that resides in the peripheral subunits in a pH-dependent manner."

https://openalex.org/W2052887240,"The quail slow myosin heavy chain 3 (slow MyHC 3) gene is expressed in the developing heart and in slow muscles of the developing limb. It is first expressed in the pulsatile cardiac tube in the embryo, and as the heart chamberizes its expression becomes restricted to the atria. To identify regulatory elements responsible for atrial-specific expression, the 5′ upstream region of slow MyHC 3 gene was investigated. An atrial regulatory domain (ARD1) between −840 and −680 acts as an atrial cell-specific enhancer in primary cardiocyte cultures. ARD1 also specifies atrial-specific expression in vivo when the ARD1/heterologous promoter was introduced into developing chick embryos by a replication-competent retroviral vector. ARD1 is the first atrial cell-specific enhancer to be identified. Fine deletion and mutation analysis within ARD1 defined a 40-base pair vitamin D3 receptor-like element that controls atrial cell-specific expression of the slow MyHC 3 gene by inhibiting its expression in ventricular cardiocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2101288526,"We have examined the formation of the primosome subassembly of the bacteriophage T4-coded DNA replication (elongation) complex from its helicase, primase, and DNA components. Previously, we had shown that the T4 helicase (gp41) exists in solution in a stable monomer ⇆ dimer equilibrium at physiological protein (and salt) concentrations and forms a hexamer upon activation by ATP (or GTP) binding (Dong, F., Gogol, E. P., and von Hippel, P. H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 7462-7473). Here we report that the T4 primase (gp61) is a monomer in solution under the same conditions, and that the ATP-activated helicase binds to a single gp61 primase molecule on appropriate DNA templates to reconstitute a stable primosome. We show that: (i) the gp41 helicase alone does not form a stable complex with DNA templates, although this helicase by itself can carry out moderately processive ATP-driven translocation along single-stranded DNA (Young, M. C., Schultz, D. E., Ring, D., and von Hippel, P. H. (1994) J. Mol. Biol. 235, 1447-1458); (ii) the primase alone does form a stable complex with DNA; (iii) the helicase can bind to the primase-DNA complex in the presence of ATP or GTP to form a stable ternary complex; (iv) this complex consists of six helicase subunits and one primase subunit; and (v) the reconstituted primosome is stable for at least 10 to 20 min after NTP cleavage and dissociation of the hydrolysis products. These results strongly suggest that the functional T4 DNA replication primosome consists of an integrated 6:1 helicase-primase complex bound to DNA, and that the ATP-activated helicase hexamer remains intact throughout the processive DNA replication process.

These results strongly suggest that the functional T4 DNA replication primosome consists of an integrated 6:1 helicase-primase complex bound to DNA, and that the ATP-activated helicase hexamer remains intact throughout the processive DNA replication process. The elongation phase of DNA replication in many organisms is characterized by similar patterns of molecular organization and mechanism (see Kornberg and Baker (11Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar)). The replication complex typically contains three functional subassemblies that operate at the replication fork. These are: (i) the central DNA polymerase that catalyzes template-directed 5′→ 3′ leading and lagging strand synthesis of the nascent DNA and often carries a 3′→ 5′ exonuclease (editing) activity as well; (ii) a set of polymerase accessory proteins that stabilize the polymerase on the DNA template by forming a “holoenzyme” complex to permit processive synthesis, especially of the leading strand within the DNA replication fork; and (iii) a primosome complex (composed of helicase and primase) that unwinds the double-stranded template DNA ahead of the replication fork and lays down small RNA primers for the multiple initiation events required for the discontinuous synthesis of lagging strand DNA. These subassemblies combine to form an integrated DNA replication complex that is capable of carrying out coordinated leading and lagging strand synthesis and drive the overall movement of the DNA replication fork. The bacteriophage T4 utilizes seven discrete T4-coded proteins to carry out the elongation phase of DNA replication (Alberts, 2Alberts B.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1987; 317: 395-420Google Scholar; Cha and Alberts, 5Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. Cancer Cells. 1988; 6: 1-10Google Scholar; Nossal, 18Nossal N.G. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 43-53Google Scholar).

In concert, these components form a polymerase holoenzyme that can carry out processive DNA replication on primed single-stranded DNA templates under physiological conditions. Efficient DNA replication on double-stranded DNA templates also requires the participation of a primosome subassembly, consisting of the helicase (gp41) and primase (gp61) components. The primosome catalyzes the ATP- (or GTP-) driven unwinding of the double-stranded DNA template and synthesizes the pentameric RNA primers required for coordinate lagging-strand DNA replication. In this paper we focus on the assembly and properties of the functional primosome. gene product (number) double-stranded DNA dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) molar extinction coefficients at λ (nm) purine nucleoside triphosphate, i.e. ATP or GTP adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) ATPγS or GTPγS single-stranded DNA tetramethylethylenediamine. Many studies have shown that while the helicase and primase alone can each carry out its specialized tasks to some extent, the full physiological properties and activities of these enzymes are only displayed when they function within an integrated primosome complex. Thus, the full primosome is required to permit the helicase to unwind double-stranded DNA at the high rates (up to 500 base pairs per s) characteristic of DNA replication in vivo and to permit efficient synthesis by the primase of the physiologically relevant pentaribonucleotide RNA primers (Cha and Alberts, 4Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7001-7010Google Scholar; Hinton and Nossal, 9Hinton D.M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10873-10878Google Scholar; Liu and Alberts, 14Liu C.C.

In addition, both proteins are needed to coordinate leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis at the moving DNA replication fork (Nossal and Hinton, 19Nossal N.G. Hinton D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10879-10885Google Scholar; Cha and Alberts, 6Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1791-1798Google Scholar). As an initial step in approaching the molecular properties of the T4 primosome, we examined the association states and the structures of the helicase itself (Dong et al., 7Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar) and showed that the subunits of the T4 DNA replication helicase assemble into a toroidal (ring-shaped) hexamer from its monomer and dimer solution constituents upon activation by binding of the nucleoside triphosphate substrate (ATP or GTP) of the helicase. This study also showed that the NTP-activated gp41 helicase exists as a hexagonal trimer of dimers and suggested that the hexamer may be characterized by pseudo-C3 or pseudo-D3 symmetry. Here, we build on that study to present a physical biochemical description of the formation of the T4 primosome complex on DNA templates. We show that the ATP-activated gp41 helicase hexamer binds to a single subunit of gp61 primase on a DNA template to form the primosome subassembly of the T4 DNA replication complex. Our results also show that the primosome formed by the helicase hexamer and the primase is very stable and suggest that the primosome remains associated during the entire cycle of ATP hydrolysis, DNA template unwinding, and presumably lagging-strand primer formation. The chemicals used for buffers, for gel electrophoresis (including acrylamide, bisacrylamide, TEMED, and ammonium persulfate), and for the silver staining of protein gels, were all Gel Electrophoresis or Analytical Reagent grade. Purine nucleoside triphosphates and their nonhydrolyzable analogs (ATP, GTP, ATPγS, and GTPγS) were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. The homobifunctional protein-protein cross-linking reagent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), DSP, was purchased from Sigma. The T4-coded DNA replication helicase (gp41) was overexpressed using Escherichia coli strain OR1265/pDH518 (Hinton et al., 10Hinton D.M. Silver L.L. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12851-12857Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (Dong et al., 7Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar). The primase (gp61) was prepared as described (Hinton and Nossal, 8Hinton D.M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12858-12865Google Scholar). The E. coli strains used to overexpress both proteins were generously provided by Drs. Deborah Hinton and Nancy Nossal (NIH). Both purified proteins migrated as single bands in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis when stained with Coomassie Blue G-250. Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm, using molar extinction coefficients (εM, 280) of 7.6 × 104M−1 cm−1 (gp41) and of 6.9 × 104M−1 cm−1 (gp61) that were calculated as described (Young et al., 26Young M.C. Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Google Scholar; Pace et al., 20Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Google Scholar). Single-stranded M13mp18 DNA was prepared as described previously (Lechner and Richardson, 13Lechner R.L. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11185-11196Google Scholar) and was used as the initial DNA template on which to reconstitute primosome complexes. At room temperature this material contains multiple DNA hairpins, each of which has the essential geometry of a small DNA replication fork. Reconstituted primosomes were usually prepared in the same buffer that we had used previously to form ATP-activated helicase hexamers (Dong et al., 7Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar). This buffer (TAMK) contained 33 mM Tris-OAc, 50 mM KOAc, 6 mM Mg(OAc)2 (pH 7.8) and was made 1 mM (sometimes 2 mM) in ATP or GTP (or their nonhydrolyzable analogs, ATPγS or GTPγS) before the single-stranded M13 DNA template was added (usually to a final concentration of 5 or 10 nM in DNA molecules). The primase was then added, followed by the helicase. The final concentration of the primase was usually set at 0.5 or 1 µM, and that of the helicase ranged from 0.5 to 6 µM (in protein monomers). Due to carryover from the protein storage buffer, the experimental samples also generally contained 10 to 20% glycerol; control experiments (data not shown) indicated that glycerol concentrations in this range have little or no effect on the behavior of the reconstituted primosomes in the experiments described in this study. Samples were generally incubated at room temperature for 1 to 2 min after addition of all components (the helicase was added last) prior to being used for further characterization. Native agarose gels were prepared using 0.5% agarose dissolved (with heating in a microwave oven) in a gel-running buffer containing 33 mM Tris-OAc, 50 mM KOAc, 0.1 mM Mg(OAc)2 (pH 7.8). A minigel 10 cm in length and 6.5 cm wide was usually poured with a comb to form 12 sample wells. After the samples had been prepared and incubated at room temperature for 1 to 2 min, they were loaded onto the gel and were electrophoresed at ~2 V/cm (~40 V for the minigel apparatus) at room temperature. One or two separate lanes were usually loaded with an indicator dye to monitor the progress of the electrophoresis. Gels were run until the bromphenol blue indicator dye had migrated for about 3 cm from the gel origin and were then stained with either ethidium bromide or with SYBR-Green I (Molecular Probes Inc.) to visualize the free DNA and the protein-DNA complex bands. Discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gels for quantitative determination of the protein constituents of protein-DNA complexes were prepared using the method of Laemmli (Laemmli, 12Laemmli U.K. Nature (Lond.). 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). A 12.5% (110:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) separating gel with a 6% (110:1 acryl:bisacrylamide) stacking gel system was usually used. This system provided good separation between denatured helicase and primase subunits. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with silver and were analyzed by soft laser scanning densitometry. Reconstituted primosomes were subjected to native gel electrophoresis to remove unbound protein, after which the protein-DNA complexes were excised from the native agarose gels and were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to determine the amounts of helicase and primase present. A Zeineh SL-504-XL soft laser scanning densitometer was used for this quantitation, and data acquisition and analysis were performed using the Videophoresis II computer program (BioMed Instruments Inc.). Due to the shallow linear-response (dynamic) range of the silver-stained gels and the densitometry scanning technique, various amounts of each of the two proteins were also loaded onto gels to which sample proteins of known concentration had been added for calibration. The amount of each protein was then determined by measuring peak areas in densitometer scanning. The bifunctional chemical cross-linker DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), was used to analyze the association state(s) of the gp61 primase by cross-linking protein complexes, as described previously for the gp41 helicase (Dong et al., 7Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments were carried out in the same buffer used for the preparation of the primosome samples, either in the presence or in the absence of 1 mM purine nucleoside triphosphate cofactor. Samples were prepared by incubating the gp61 primase (1 µM) in the buffer for 1 to 2 min at room temperature, after which cross-linking was initiated by adding small amounts (2% of the total reaction volume) of freshly prepared DSP stock solutions in dimethylformamide (final DSP concentrations in cross-linking reactions were 0.1% or 0.01%, w/v, depending on experiments). Cross-linking reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 20 min 2We had shown previously (Dong et al., 7Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar) that at these protein and cross-linker concentrations (0.1%) the reaction goes to completion within this time. and were then quenched by adding a one-tenth volume of 1.4 M ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.0). After further incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the samples were made 1% in SDS and 10% in glycerol (by volume), incubated at 37°C for 30 min, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the phosphate-SDS gel system (Weber and Osborn, 25Weber K. Osborn M. Neurath H. Hill R.L. The Proteins. Academic Press, New York1975: 179Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the protein bands were observed by silver staining. A native gel band-shift assay was used to measure the interactions between the components of the primosome. Previous functional and enzymatic studies had shown that the gp41 helicase can interact with single-stranded or forked DNA templates (Young et al., 26Young M.C. Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Google Scholar; Dong et al., 7Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar). However, our native gel band-shift experiments, using single-stranded M13 DNA as a putative binding and translocation (and perhaps helicase) substrate, show that the gp41 helicase by itself does not form complexes with these single-stranded M13 DNA templates that are stable enough to be visualized by this technique (see Fig. 1A, lanes 2-5). Similar observations had been made previously with φX174 single-stranded DNA (Richardson and Nossal, 22Richardson R.W. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (a): 4725-4731Google Scholar, 23Richardson R.W. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (b): 4732-4739Google Scholar). The observation that the binding of gp41 with its DNA cofactors cannot be observed in standard gel-shift experiments is not necessarily at odds with earlier demonstrations that these DNA cofactors, in similar buffers and at comparable concentrations, can stimulate the ATPase activity of the helicase and perhaps serve as relatively inefficient helicase substrates. An important difference between these experiments is that while the samples for the band-shift experiments were prepared in the presence of ATP or GTP (or their analogs), they were typically run without nucleotide cofactors in the native agarose gel electrophoresis experiment itself. Thus, the interactions between gp41 and single-stranded or forked DNA that we have observed by ATPase stimulation (Young et al., 26Young M.C. Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Google Scholar), by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (with ATP present in the gels and the running buffer, Young et al. (26Young M.C. Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Google Scholar)), and by direct cryoelectron microscopic imaging (Dong et al., 7Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar), were all dependent on the continuous presence of purine nucleoside triphosphates and were shown to be relatively weak or transient in the absence of these cofactors. On the other hand, we now find that gp61 primase can be shown by standard gel-shift experiments to bind and remain stably associated with ss M13 DNA under all buffer conditions tested (Fig. 1A, lanes 6-9). No nucleotide cofactors are required for this association (lane 6). However, the complexes formed by the primase and ss M13 DNA have a very strong tendency to aggregate, especially when the primase is present at high concentrations such as those used in Fig. 1A. At lower primase concentrations (representing also a lower primase:DNA ratio), aggregation is less severe (Fig. 1B, lane 1). This aggregation of primase on ss M13 DNA is completely alleviated by the presence of proper amounts of the gp41 helicase, as shown in the experiments presented in Fig. 2A, which were performed at the same primase and ss M13 DNA concentrations (and under the same experimental conditions) as those in Fig. 1A. Figs. 1B and 2A also demonstrate that gp41 binds stably to a primase-DNA complex in the presence of PuTP as indicated by the further retardation of the complex in the native agarose gels. (A similar increase in protein association on adding gp41 to primase-DNA complexes was observed previously in similar experiments using single-stranded φX174 DNA as cofactor (Richardson and Nossal, 22Richardson R.W. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (a): 4725-4731Google Scholar).) This conclusion is confirmed by protein content analysis of these complexes using SDS-gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2B). Many lines of evidence have suggested that the T4 helicase and primase proteins function together as a primosome complex within the DNA replication system. Our findings that the gp61 primase tends to aggregate when interacting with ssDNA by itself, but not when the gp41 helicase is also present, and also that the gp41 helicase alone interacts only weakly with the DNA template, but much more stably with a primase-DNA template complex, support the functional importance of the primosome assembly. The agarose gel shown in Fig. 1B also suggests that the size of the helicase-primase complex approaches a limit when the ratio of helicase to primase subunits exceeds approximately 6:1. To determine directly the protein subunit stoichiometry of these reconstituted complexes, increasing amounts of gp41 were titrated into fixed concentrations of ss M13 DNA and gp61 until gp41 was clearly present in excess. The resultant DNA-bound complexes were then freed of excess components by native agarose gel electrophoresis, and the ratio of bound helicase to primase subunits was determined by densitometry of the component gp41 and gp61 bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2). The results presented in Fig. 2, A and B, clearly show that in the presence of excess gp41, the amount of gp41 bound within the complex is limited by the amount of gp61 available. In support of this interpretation, we show (in Fig. 2A, lanes 4-6) that reducing the amount of gp61 by 50% or 75% results in the loss of a corresponding amount of gp41 from the complexes. This shows that gp41 interacts stoichiometrically with gp61 and that the primase is not just acting as a “loading” factor to facilitate the interaction of DNA with gp41. Two-fold higher concentrations of proteins (relative to those used in Fig. 1B) were used in this experiment to permit more accurate measurement of protein concentrations in SDS-polyacrylamide gels by silver staining. The ratio of gp41 to gp61 subunits in the complexes was determined by laser densitometric scanning of the silver-stained SDS gels, using known amounts of each protein loaded onto the same gel for calibration, and was found to reach a limit ratio of 5:1 to 7:1 when excess of gp41 was present (see Table I). This subunit stoichiometry ratio is in accord with the titration experiment shown in Fig. 1B. A completely accurate stoichiometry ratio cannot be determined using this technique because of the very narrow dynamic quantitation range available with protein silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. However, since gp41 itself forms a hexamer upon activation by the binding of its PuTP substrate (Dong et al., 7Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar), these data strongly support a 6:1 stoichiometry of gp41:gp61 subunits within the primosome. This ratio is also in good accord with previous reports on the stimulation of gp41 ATPase and helicase activities by added gp61 (Hinton and Nossal, 9Hinton D.M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10873-10878Google Scholar; Richardson and Nossal, 23Richardson R.W. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (b): 4732-4739Google Scholar).Table IQuantitation of helicase and primase proteins in the reconstituted primosome complexes (see text)[gp61] in the starting reaction[gp41] in the starting reactiongp41/gp61 ratio in the starting reactiongp41/gp61 ratio in the protein-DNA complexµM1111 ± 0.51222 ± 0.51666 ± 10.56126 ± 10.256246 ± 2 Open table in a new tab To check for the possibility of additional subunit interactions within the primosome, we also used protein-protein cross-linking to see whether primase alone forms dimers or higher associated forms in solution. We used the protein-protein chemical cross-linking procedure that we had previously employed to demonstrate the various association forms of the gp41 helicase (Dong et al., 7Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments were performed with gp61 in both the presence and absence of purine nucleoside triphosphates. Our results (see Fig. 3) suggest that, unlike the helicase (lane S), the primase alone exists as a monomer under all solution conditions tested and does not associate to higher forms. This result, together with the fact that gp41 hexamers also do not associate further in solution (Dong et al., 7Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar), strongly suggests that the functional primosome subassembly contains six helicase subunits together with one monomer of primase. ADP is produced by the ATPase activity of gp41; thus, it is important to ask whether ADP has any effect on the stability of the primosome. The experiments shown in Fig. 4 test the effects of this nucleotide on the stability of the primosome and show that ADP does seem to affect the formation or the stability of the primosome. When primosome assembly experiments were performed in the presence of ADP and analyzed by native agarose gel electrophoresis (using the same conditions as the previous native gels, i.e. no nucleotide cofactors in the running buffer), some complexes larger than the primase-DNA complexes seen in Fig. 1A (lanes 5-9) were detected. However, these complexes were much smaller than those formed in primosome assembly experiments carried out in the presence of ATP or GTPγS. Based on these findings alone, we cannot know whether these intermediate-sized complexes correspond to “regular” (6:1) primosomes that have partially dissociated during gel electrophoresis or to complexes that were incompletely assembled prior to loading onto the gels. As we will show below, primosomes assembled by ATP binding are stable for long periods of time, even after the nucleoside triphosphate substrates have been completely removed. Such results strongly argue that the intermediate-sized complexes we observe here must reflect incomplete reconstitution of primosomes in the presence of ADP and demonstrate again that proper primosome assembly requires the presence of PuTP or PuTPγS. Previously (Dong et al., 7Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar), we had shown that the gp41 helicase alone undergoes reversible hexamer formation that is dependent on the binding of its PuTP substrate. Therefore, it was important to determine whether the helicase within the primosome remains hexameric during the entire translocation/helicase/replication cycle or whether it dissociates and reassociates during each cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis. We have approached this question by determining whether helicase hexamers within the reconstituted primosome complexes bound to ss M13 DNA remain hexameric after ATP removal. (We note that the persistence of such complexes in native gel-shift experiments, as in Figs. 1A and 2A, do not speak to this point since complexes that appear stable within gels may be held together artificially by gel “caging” effects.) Fig. 5 shows that primosomes formed as 6:1 helicase-primase complexes on ss M13 DNA and incubated for 10 min (Fig. 5) or 20 min (data not shown) at room temperature after ATP removal remain intact. We have shown above that primosomes formed by the interaction of helicase and primase are stable for prolonged periods, even after ATP depletion. We ask here whether these stable primosomes contain bound ATP or its hydrolysis products. To this end experiments were performed using radioactively labeled ATP carrying 32P at either the γ- or the α-phosphate positions. We reasoned that if the primosomes remaining after removal of free ATP and hydrolysis products by gel filtration still bound intact or hydrolyzed ATP (i.e., both ADP and Pi), the primosome complexes should be labeled in both experiments; on the other hand, if the primosome binds only ADP or Pi, only the primosome reconstituted in the presence of α- or γ-[32P]ATP (but not both) will carry the radioactive label. Of course, the former outcome would not distinguish between intact bound ATP and its hydrolyzed products; however, previous studies (Young et al., 26Young M.C. Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Google Scholar) have shown that the ATP hydrolysis rate by the helicase is very fast, and it is therefore unlikely that ATP bound to gp41 would remain unhydrolyzed after the long incubation periods used here. The results of such experiments are shown in Fig. 6. Lanes 1 and 2 contained the primosome complexes reconstituted in the presence of γ- and α-32P-labeled ATP, respectively. If all six helicase subunits in the primosome contain a bound ADP or Pi (or both), the complexes will carry 32P labels with equal amounts of radioactivity, as shown in control lanes 5 and 6 (which were loaded with the equivalent amounts of free radioactivity). The amounts of radioactivity in lanes 5 and 6 were chosen so that if all six subunits of the helicase bind 32P, the radioactivity in the primosome complexes (loaded in lanes 1 and 2) would be equal to that seen in these lanes. We find, however, that no detectable radioactivity is found at the position at which the primosome complexes run on the native agarose gel. (The position is defined in the control experiment using SYBR-green I nucleic acid stains in Fig. 6B, lane 2). Therefore, the primosome complex remains intact as a 6:1 helicase:primase complex even after all nucleoside triphosphate and its hydrolyzed products have been released. Taking these results together, it is clear that the PuTP substrate of the helicase is required to form the primosome. However, once formed, the primosome is very stable by itself. Thus, even though the ATP-activated hexamerization of the helicase is reversible (Dong et al., 7Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar), the helicase hexamer is stabilized against dissociation by the primase within the primosome. Hence, the primosome remains stable over a much longer period than the milliseconds required to complete the ATPase and helicase cycles, which strongly suggests that once the primosome is formed the gp41 helicase component remains hexameric during the full functional cycle and does not alternate between different oligomeric forms. In this study we have shown that the gp61 primase binds stably by itself to appropriate DNA templates, while the gp41 helicase hexamer in the absence of the primase interacts with DNA cofactors relatively weakly and transiently. These observations support an assembly pathway like that outlined in Fig. 7. However, the order of addition of the components shown here may not be invariant, since we know that gp41 helicase alone can interact functionally with the DNA substrate as shown in previous studies (Young et al., 26Young M.C. Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Google Scholar; Dong et al., 7Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar) and that primase and helicase in the absence of DNA can also form a weakly associated complex. 3F. Dong, C. R. Hart, P. Pietroni, and P. H. von Hippel, manuscript in preparation. The definition of an unambiguous assembly pathway for primosome formation is not crucial to understanding the functional and mechanistic properties of this complex. The structure that the primosome adopts, and the interactions that stabilize it during its function, are more important concerns. Results from this study, together with our previous findings (Dong et al., 7Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar), clearly demonstrate that the subunits of the T4 DNA replication helicase form a hexamer when activated by the binding of PuTP substrate, and that this hexamer is capable of binding to a primase monomer and DNA to reconstitute a primosome. What we have learned here provides an observational basis that permit us to establish some qualitative “boundary conditions” for the formation and stability of complete and partial primosome complexes. These observations are summarized in Fig. 8. The quantitative magnitudes of the interactions that underlie this scheme will be presented elsewhere.3 It is clear from this study that once properly assembled in the presence of purine nucleoside triphosphates, the primosome remains stable for 20 min or more under the conditions tested even if the supply of unhydrolyzed PuTP is depleted. Physiological conditions, under which ample PuTP is available, certainly favor stable primosome formation, and we have shown that the stable primosome complex, containing 1 primase and 6 helicase subunits, is likely to remain assembled through the entire replication cycle on the T4 genome. Determination of subunit stoichiometry and composition of the primosome is the first step to establishing the structure of the complex. The 6 to 1 stoichiometry established here, in combination with our previous demonstration that the helicase itself is a ring-shaped hexamer (Dong et al., 7Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar), seems to suggest that the helicase hexamer is likely to remain in this general conformation within the complex. However, this result does not define the position of the primase within the primosome. We know that the primase must interact with the DNA and, at least transiently, with all six helicase subunits. This raises the question of the location of gp61 inside the primosome complex. Considering that the helicase hexamer itself is a ring-shaped structure with pseudo-C3 or D3 symmetry, the primase is most likely to reside in a position close to the C3 rotational axis of the helicase hexamer. However, a primase subunit that shuttles from one helicase monomer (or dimer) binding site to another during primosome function is also possible. Such behavior has been seen for the subunits within the bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase (Abrahams et al., 1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Google Scholar). In addition, we note that the bacteriophage T7 primosome complex is also hexameric, but that each subunit carries both a helicase and a primase domain (Mendelman et al., 16Mendelman L.V. Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27208-27213Google Scholar; Patel and Hingorani, 21Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 186S-189SGoogle Scholar). At present, there is no structural evidence to discriminate between a centrally located primase within the primosome and a primase that shuttles from one helicase subunit to another as the primosome functions. Formation of separate DNA polymerase holoenzyme and primosome subassemblies seems to be general in the DNA replication systems of many different organisms (Kornberg and Baker, 11Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). In addition, many (most?) DNA helicases that are involved in genomic DNA replication seem to exist and function as hexamers (see Table II in Dong et al. (7Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Google Scholar)) upon activation either by their PuTP substrates or by the DNA template. Furthermore, those hexameric helicases that have been investigated in detail all seem to adopt a toroidal (ring-shaped) subunit arrangement. In spite of these large scale structural similarities, no atomic level structure has been established for any helicase or primosome. Nevertheless, it is likely that DNA replication primosomes from different organisms will be found to share a certain degree of structural similarity, and it is reasonable to speculate that the hexameric structure of these helicases (and the resulting common structural features that may characterize primosomes) will turn out to have general mechanistic significance. Recent studies (Spacciapoli and Nossal, 24Spacciapoli P. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 447-455Google Scholar; Barry and Alberts, 3Barry J. Alberts B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 33069-33081Google Scholar) suggest that the T4-coded gp59 protein (the gp41 helicase assembly factor) is important under some conditions for the loading of the gp41 helicase onto DNA to form a functional complex with other replication proteins. Our finding here that the primosome can be formed on ss M13 DNA in the absence of the gp59 protein support the notion that this protein may only be required to assemble the helicase onto single-stranded DNA-binding protein (gp32)-coated DNA templates, in agreement with previous results (Barry and Alberts, 3Barry J. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33049-33062Google Scholar; Morrical et al., 17Morrical S.W. Hempstead K. Morrical M.D. J. Biol.

Whether this assembly factor is required to load the activated helicase hexamer onto a primase that is already present on a gp32-coated DNA template is not yet known. We are grateful to Drs. Nancy Nossal and Bruce Alberts and their laboratory colleagues for providing various cells and plasmids and for helpful discussions during the course of this work."

How it is regulated is uncertain; however, it is inhibited by matrix Mg2+ and matrix protons. Previously determined values for the IC50 suggested that the channel would be closed under physiological conditions. In a previous study (Liu, G., Hinch, B., Davatol-Hag, H., Lu, Y., Powers, M., and Beavis, A. D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19717–19723), it was demonstrated that the channel is highly temperature-dependent, and that a large component of this sensitivity resulted from an effect on the pIC50 for protons. We have now investigated the effect of temperature on the inhibition by Mg2+ and have found that it too is temperature-dependent. When the temperature is raised from 20 °C to 45 °C, the IC50 increases from 22 to 350 μm at pH 7.4 and from 80 to 1.5 mm at pH 8.4, respectively. The Arrhenius plot for the IC50 is linear with a slope = –80 kJ/mol. The IC50 is also strongly pH-dependent, and at 37 °C increases from 90 μm at pH 7.4 to 1230 μm at pH 8.4. In view of the extremely rapid fluxes that IMAC is capable of conducting at 37 °C, we conclude that inhibition by matrix Mg2+ and protons is necessary to limit its activity under physiological conditions. We conclude that the primary role of Mg2+ is to ensure IMAC is poised to allow regulation by small changes in pH in the physiological range. This control is mediated by a direct effect of H+ on the activity, in addition to an indirect effect mediated by a change in the Mg2+ IC50. The question that remains is not whether IMAC can be active at physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and H+, but what other factors might increase its sensitivity to changes in mitochondrial volume.

The question that remains is not whether IMAC can be active at physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and H+, but what other factors might increase its sensitivity to changes in mitochondrial volume. The mitochondrial inner membrane anion channel (IMAC) 1The abbreviations used are: IMACinner membrane anion channelMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidTAPSN-tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid. is a non-selective anion channel that carries a wide variety of anions ranging from small, singly charged ions, such as Cl– and HCO –3, to multicharged anions, such as citrate, ferrocyanide, and even ATP (reviewed in Ref. 1Beavis A.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In view of the variety of anions transported and the fact that, under physiological conditions, mitochondria generate a membrane potential that is about 180 mV negative on the inside, we have hypothesized that IMAC, in conjunction with the K+/H+ antiporter, is involved in mitochondrial volume homeostasis (1Beavis A.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The combined action of these transporters coupled to the proton pumps of the respiratory chain provides a mechanism for respiratory energy to drive salt efflux. In recent years, other roles have been proposed for IMAC. Vanden Hoek et al. (2Vanden Hoek T.L. Becker L.B. Shao Z. Li C. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18092-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) have proposed that IMAC may also be involved in the efflux of the superoxide anion from mitochondria during ischemic preconditioning, and O'Rourke and coworkers (3O'Rourke B.

Although, in energized mitochondria, the anion flux through IMAC is expected to be in the outward direction, IMAC is most easily assayed in de-energized mitochondria by monitoring the rate of passive mitochondrial swelling that occurs after the addition of the potassium ionophore valinomycin to mitochondria suspended in potassium salts of the test anion (1Beavis A.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). By using this assay, it has been shown that potential physiological regulators of IMAC include matrix Mg2+ and matrix protons (5Beavis A.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15085-15093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Beavis A.D. Powers M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17148-17155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of nonphysiological inhibitors have also been identified. These include amphiphilic amines such as propranolol, the irreversible inhibitor N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and tributyltin, which is probably the most potent inhibitor of IMAC identified to date (see Ref. 1Beavis A.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar for review of properties). More recently, we demonstrated that IMAC is extremely sensitive to temperature, in a manner that suggests the open probability is temperature-dependent (7Liu G. Hinch B. Davatol-Hag H. Lu Y. Powers M. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19717-19723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For example, using malonate as the substrate anion, the flux increased about 1000-fold when the temperature was raised from 5 to 40 °C. A large part of this stimulation seems to result from a decrease in the pIC50 of one of the inhibitory protonation sites. The most significant aspect of these findings is that they suggest the activity of IMAC might be significantly higher at physiological pH values and temperatures than what has been predicted from previous studies that were carried out at 25 °C. The actual activity under physiological conditions cannot be predicted, however, because the effects of temperature were determined in Mg2+-depleted mitochondria, and the effect of temperature on the inhibition by matrix Mg2+ is unknown. On the basis of published values for the IC50 for Mg2+ determined at 25 °C (6Beavis A.D. Powers M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17148-17155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Jung and Brierley (8Jung D.W. Brierley G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1194-C1201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have pointed out that activation of IMAC is unlikely at physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and, for similar reasons, O'Rourke (3O'Rourke B. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) has stated that the physiological role of IMAC is unclear. Thus, the goal of the present work was to determine the effect of temperature on the inhibition of IMAC by Mg2+ and thus shed light on its physiological significance. The data presented show that the IC50 for Mg2+ is strongly dependent upon temperature increasing from about 30 μm at 25 °C to about 100 μm at 37 °C; moreover, at 37 °C it increases further to 1.2 mm when the pH is raised to 8.4. From these results, we estimate that, in the presence of 0.5 mm Mg2+ at 37 °C and pH 7.4, IMAC may be about 7% active. In view of the very high intrinsic activity of this channel, this represents a very significant flux of 400 nmol/min·mg. Assay of Anion Transport—Anion transport was assayed by following the swelling that accompanies net salt transport, using the light-scattering technique as described in detail elsewhere (9Beavis A.D.

In brief, reciprocal absorbance, as a function of mitochondrial volume, is monitored and normalized for mitochondrial protein concentration in the assay to yield a parameter referred to as β; its rate of change can be converted to a rate of ion transport in nmol/min per mg mitochondrial protein. In a previous study of the effect of temperature on IMAC (7Liu G. Hinch B. Davatol-Hag H. Lu Y. Powers M. Beavis A.D. J. Biol.

In brief, the mitochondrial stock suspension (50 mg/ml) was diluted 1:5 into a medium containing potassium salts of MOPS (25 mm) and EDTA (5 mm), adjusted to pH 7.4 at 25 °C, and maintained at 0 °C. A23187 (10 nmol/mg), nigericin (0.5 nmol/mg), and rotenone (0.5 μg/mg) were added, and at least 10 min was allowed to elapse before transfer of aliquots to the assay medium. Assay Media for Anion Transport—The potassium chloride medium for assay of IMAC contained the potassium salts of Cl (55 mm), EGTA (0.1 mm), and MOPS (5 mm for assays at pH 7.4) or TAPS (5 mm for assays at pH 8.4). After the addition of the pretreated mitochondria, the final assay medium also contained EDTA (50 μm) and sucrose (0.5 mm). All media were 110 milliosmolar. For experiments in which the temperature was to be varied, the pH of the medium was adjusted at 25 °C to a value, calculated on the basis of –0.0095 for ΔpK/°C for MOPS and –0.021 for ΔpK/°C for TAPS, that would yield the desired pH at the assay temperature. Thus, separate assay media were prepared for each temperature to be studied. The value of ΔpK/°C was determined experimentally in the assay media described above. The temperature of the medium in the assay tube was measured during the experiment to ensure that a steady value had been achieved. The free concentration of Mg2+ was calculated for each temperature and pH value using the program WinMaxC (courtesy of C. Patton, Stanford University). The same program was used to calculate the total Mg2+ to be added to obtain a specific free concentration. Drugs, Reagents, and Mitochondria—Most drugs were obtained from Sigma. Valinomycin, nigericin, and rotenone were dissolved in ethanol, and A23187 (20 mm stock) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Rat liver mitochondria were prepared from 30 to 35-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (9Beavis A.D. Brannan R. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13424-13433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the first slow-spin pellet was discarded and not resuspended, and the rats were not starved. Analysis of Data—All figures were prepared and nonlinear regression was accomplished by using the program GraphPad Prism version 3.03 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Effect of Temperature on Inhibition of IMAC by Mg2+—In a previous paper (6Beavis A.D. Powers M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17148-17155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that when the mitochondrial IMAC is assayed at 25 °C, it is inhibited by matrix Mg2+, and that the IC50 rises from 38 μm at pH 7.4 to 250 μm at pH 8.4. The values obtained were not affected by the method used to remove endogenous Mg2+ nor by the time of addition of Mg2+ to the assay medium. In the present study, because the rate of swelling is very rapid at high temperature, the mitochondria were pretreated with A23187 and EDTA to ensure complete depletion of endogenous Mg2+, and Mg2+ and valinomycin were added to the assay at zero time, i.e. before the mitochondria. The data contained in Fig. 1 show typical traces obtained at three temperatures: 25 °C for comparison with previous data, 37 °C to determine the flux at physiological temperatures, and 15 °C to illustrate behavior at low temperatures. In each case, there is a short acceleration phase before maximum swelling rates are observed. Mg2+ inhibited the fluxes at all three temperatures and the IC50 values obtained from the dose response curves shown in Fig. 2 are 114 μm, 37 μm, and 17 μm at 37 °C, 25 °C, and 15 °C, respectively. Note, however, that the Hill coefficients tend to increase with the temperature. Consistent with our previous studies (7Liu G. Hinch B. Davatol-Hag H. Lu Y. Powers M. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19717-19723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the control rates are strongly temperature-dependent, with values equal to 4.0, 1.2, and 0.23 μmol Cl–/min·mg at 37 °C, 25 °C, and 15 °C, respectively.Fig. 2Effect of temperature on dose-response curves for inhibition of IMAC by magnesium. Dose-response curves for inhibition of Cl– fluxes determined from the traces contained in Fig. 1 are shown. Rates were determined from the traces by applying linear regression to the data points collected between β values of 0.5 and 0.6 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” IC50 values and Hill coefficients (n) were determined by using nonlinear regression and the equation J = J0/(1 + ([Mg2+]/IC50)n) and assuming complete inhibition at infinite [Mg2+]. A, temperature of 37 °C, IC50 = 114 μm, n = 1.49. B, temperature of 25 °C, IC50 = 37 μm, n = 1.18. C, temperature of 15 °C, IC50 = 117 μm, n = 0.79.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Relationship Between Mg2+IC50 and Temperature—To examine more closely the relationship between the Mg2+ IC50 and temperature and how this might be affected by pH, we carried out dose-response studies at a series of temperatures ranging from 5 to 45 °C and at two pH values, pH 7.4 and 8.1. For each temperature, the pH of the assay medium was adjusted separately to ensure that the assay pH did not vary with temperature. The data contained in Fig. 3 show Arrhenius plots of the control rates of Cl– transport in the absence of Mg2+ at the two pH values. Non-linear relationships are observed, consistent with the data obtained previously using malonate as the substrate for IMAC (7Liu G. Hinch B. Davatol-Hag H. Lu Y. Powers M. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19717-19723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Note that there is a 275-fold increase in rate when the temperature is raised from 10 to 45 °C at pH 7.4, and at 10 °C, there is a 15-fold increase in rate when the pH is raised from 7.4 to 8.1. The curves are drawn using Equation 1 (equation 9 of Ref. 7Liu G. Hinch B. Davatol-Hag H. Lu Y. Powers M. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19717-19723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which was derived on the basis of a model in which the open probability of the channel is temperature-dependent.lnJ=A+lnT-ΔHfluxRT+ΔSfluxR-ln(1+exp(ΔHopenR(1T-1T50)))(Eq. 1) where ΔHflux and ΔSflux are the activation enthalpy and entropy of the transport process, and T50 is the temperature at which 50% of the channels are open, which is given by T50 = ΔHopen/ΔSopen where ΔHopen and ΔSopen are the enthalpy and entropy of channel opening, respectively. Like the transport rate, the Mg2+ IC50 is strongly dependent upon the temperature increasing exponentially as the temperature is raised (Fig. 4A). In contrast to the Arrhenius plots for the transport rates, the Arrhenius plots of the IC50 values are essentially linear. Using values interpolated from the curves fitted to the data, the ratio of IC50 values range from about 4.6 at 45 °C to 5.3 at 20 °C. The narrow temperature range and scatter in the data do not allow one to determine to what extent the effect of pH results from a change in the slope or intercept. However, whatever the cause of the shift, there is about a 5-fold increase in Mg2+ IC50 as the pH is raised from 7.4 to 8.1 over the temperature range examined. Influence of Temperature on the Relationship between Mg2+IC50 and pH—To examine further the effect of temperature on the relationship between the IC50 for Mg2+ and pH, the IC50 was determined at a series of pH values ranging from 7.35 to pH 8.35 at 25 °C and 37 °C. The results of two independent experiments contained in Fig. 5 reveal that the IC50 increases 10-fold and 16-fold at 25 °C and 37 °C, respectively. The curves drawn were fitted to the data using a model, previously shown to describe the relationship between the Mg2+ IC50 and pH at 25 °C (6Beavis A.D. Powers M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17148-17155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in whichIC50=KMg(1+(KH/[H+])n)(Eq. 2) Because the intercept on the ordinate is so close to the origin, the data do not allow one to determine whether the effect of temperature is mediated by means of an effect on KMg or the pK for the protonation site. The slopes, however, which are determined by the product KMg·KH and n differ by a factor of 7. Using the constants provided in the legend, values of IC50 can be calculated. Thus, at 37 °C, the IC50 rises from 90 μm at pH 7.4 (compare 114 μm in Fig. 1) to 250 μm at pH 7.8. This latter value is considerably closer to published estimates of the physiological free matrix Mg2+ concentration (8Jung D.W. Brierley G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1194-C1201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Estimate of IMAC Activity at Physiological Mg2+Concentration—It is now well accepted that the physiological concentration of free Mg2+ in the mitochondrial matrix is close to 0.5 mm (8Jung D.W. Brierley G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1194-C1201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also likely that dramatic changes in the free concentration do not occur under most physiological conditions. Thus, the temperature dependence of IMAC in the presence of this fixed concentration of Mg2+ is of interest. Because at pH 7.4 rates are extremely low at low temperatures, especially with Mg2+ present, we carried out this experiment at both pH 7.4 and pH 8.4. The data presented in Fig 6A show that at pH 8.4, both in the presence and absence of Mg2+, the Arrhenius plot is nonlinear. The curves were fitted to the data using Equation 1, in which the nonlinearity is attributed to a change in the open probability of the channel. Interestingly, comparison of these data with those in Fig. 3 reveals that the curve in the presence of 0.5 mm Mg2+ at pH 8.4 is very similar to that obtained in the absence of Mg2+ at pH 7.4. Thus, it is evident that like H+, Mg2+ changes the temperature dependence of the channel. This effect is most conveniently expressed as a change in T50, brought about by the preferential binding of H+ and Mg2+ to the closed state of the channel. The curves fitted indicate that the T50 increases from about 10 °C in the control curve to about 29 °C in the presence of 0.5 mm Mg2+. The latter curve was fitted using the ΔHflux obtained from the control curve. The narrow temperature range and scatter in the data do not permit one to determine whether this change results from a change in ΔHopen or ΔSopen. Because of the fact that it is difficult to measure accurately the very low rates observed when both pH and temperature are low, only rates measured between 45 and 30 °C are shown for pH 7.4. To allow comparison of the T50 with the other values, the curve was fitted by assuming that ΔHopen and ΔHflux were the same as at pH 8.4, thus yielding a value of T50 = 49 °C. To better illustrate the effect of Mg2+ and temperature on the activity of IMAC, we have plotted the data as percent inhibition of the rate at 45 °C in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 6B). The control curve (pH 8.4, no Mg2+; Fig. 6B, black circles) shows the “inhibitory” effect of lowering temperature. Between 45 and 25 °C, IMAC is inhibited by about 75%, with a Q10 = 2. In Fig. 6B, the white circles and white squares show the inhibition of the flux by temperature plus 0.5 mm Mg2+. At pH 8.4, the flux increases dramatically between 35 °C and 45 °C, whereas at pH 7.4, the channel is almost completely inhibited at 40 °C and below. The white triangles show the percent inhibition, relative to the individual control rates at each temperature, produced by 0.5 mm Mg2+ at pH 8.4. Note that, at 37 °C, there is 34% inhibition. These data suggest that Mg2+ predisposes the channel to be very sensitive to changes in mitochondrial matrix pH at physiological temperatures. In this paper, we have examined the temperature dependence of the IC50 for matrix Mg2+ for inhibition of the mitochondrial inner membrane anion channel. In view of the combined effects of pH and temperature on the Mg2+ IC50 and their direct effects on the activity of IMAC, the data presented provide strong evidence that IMAC may have considerable activity under physiological conditions. The data presented demonstrate that Mg2+ is an efficacious inhibitor over a temperature range that is associated with a 350-fold change in anion flux. We have observed, however, that the Hill coefficient for the inhibition tends to increase with temperature. It is quite likely that this reflects the involvement of more than one inhibitory Mg2+-binding site at high temperatures. A similar but more pronounced phenomenon was observed for inhibition by protons (7Liu G. Hinch B. Davatol-Hag H. Lu Y. Powers M. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19717-19723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which was explained by the presence of a second inhibitory site with a lower temperature dependence. The Hill coefficient of less than unity seen at 15 °C may reflect the presence of a small uninhibitable component, which only becomes significant at the very low fluxes observed at the low temperatures. For consistency, however, all IC50 values were determined on the basis of the assumption that the flux could be completely inhibited. The values for Mg2+ IC50 increase quite dramatically as the temperature is raised. At 45 °C, values of 1.5 and 0.35 mm were obtained at pH 8.4 and 7.4, respectively. It is also evident that the IC50 remains pH-dependent over the whole temperature range. We have previously reported (6Beavis A.D. Powers M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17148-17155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the IC50 may be expressed as a function of the binding constants for a magnesium-binding site (KMg) and a proton binding site (KH) (see Equation 2). Consequently, the slope of the Arrhenius plot for the IC50, which is linear and equal to –77 to -81 kJ/mol, is dependent upon the enthalpies of binding for both Mg2+ and H+ (ΔHMg and ΔHH). From these data, the interpolated values for the Mg2+ IC50 at 37 °C are 114 and 550 μm at pH 7.4 and 8.1, respectively. The dependence of the Mg2+ IC50 on pH (Fig. 5) is consistent with the model previously proposed (6Beavis A.D. Powers M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17148-17155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the Hill coefficient seems to increase slightly with temperature, so that the increase in IC50 with pH is greater at 37 °C than it is at 25 °C. Because both the curves extrapolate to values of IC50 very close to the origin, it is not possible to determine whether KMg is affected by temperature. Both curves shown were fitted by setting KMg = 8 μm and allowing pKH and the Hill coefficients (n) to vary. Using this approach, the effect of raising the temperature from 25 to 37 °C is explained by a decrease in the value of pKH from 6.9 to 6.5, and an increase in n from 0.89 to 1.17. Curves can be fit equally well, however, if it is assumed that pKH = 6.7 at both temperatures, and KMg and n are allowed to vary. In this case, the increase in IC50 can be explained by an increase in KMg from 6.3 to 13 μm, together with the above-mentioned increase in n. Both models allow the Mg2+ IC50 to be calculated. For example, at 37 °C, interpolated values of the IC50 are 90, 250, and 1230 μm free Mg2+ at the pH values of 7.4, 7.8, and 8.4, respectively. These data indicate that at 37 °C, as the pH rises from 7.4 to 8.4, the IC50 for Mg2+ passes from values that are about 15% of the free Mg2+ to values that are at least 2-fold higher than the free Mg2+. Thus, as the pH changes over this range, the activity of IMAC not only increases because of the diminished inhibition by protons, but also because of a decrease in the IC50 for Mg2+. Needless to say, the flux through a pathway is not simply dependent on the percent inhibition, but also the intrinsic activity of the process. Because IMAC has a very high Jmax, even when Mg2+ and H+ concentrations are significantly above their IC50 values, IMAC still has considerable activity. From the data presented here and the pH dependence described previously (7Liu G. Hinch B. Davatol-Hag H. Lu Y. Powers M. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19717-19723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we estimate that at 37 °C, the Jmax ([H+] = 0, [Mg2+] = 0) is 6 –7 μmol Cl–/min·mg. To place this value in perspective, it should be noted that the maximum rates of respiration on succinate are of the order of 200 nmol O/min·mg. Moreover, because the net H+/O stoichiometry of proton pumping is 6–7 (11Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6165-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this respiration rate corresponds to a proton flux of about 1400 nmol H+/min·mg, which is less than 25% of the capacity of IMAC. Thus, to avoid uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, in vivo IMAC must be tightly controlled and could have sufficient activity even at just a few percent of its maximum activity to play an important role in volume homeostasis. For the respiratory chain to drive net salt efflux, activity of both IMAC and the K+/H+ antiporter is required (1Beavis A.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In a preliminary study, we have found that at 37 °C and pH 8.4 the K+/H+ antiporter has a Jmax ([Mg2+] = 0) of 1.3 μmol/min·mg and a Mg2+ IC50 of 220 μm. 2A. D. Beavis and M. Powers, unpublished data. Thus, under physiological conditions, the K+/H+ antiporter could also have significant activity. Note that the relatively high activity of IMAC would ensure that respiration-driven (H+ pump) anion efflux would elevate matrix pH and further activate both the K+/H+ antiporter and IMAC, which are both regulated by matrix protons (1Beavis A.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14Beavis A.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2538-2545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Note also that the very high Jmax for IMAC relative to the rate of mitochondrial respiration is also consistent with the suggestion by Aon et al. (4Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Marbán E. O'Rourke B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44735-44744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) that IMAC is responsible for depolarization of mitochondria in myocytes observed in their studies. To illustrate better the potential roles of H+ and Mg2+ in the regulation of IMAC, we have plotted the Cl– flux calculated on the basis of the Mg2+ dependence presented here and the pH dependence reported previously (1Beavis A.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Fig. 7A shows the predicted flux as a function-free Mg2+ at different pH values, taking into account the direct effects of pH on the flux as well as its effect on the Mg2+ IC50. Given that estimates of physiological free Mg2+ are 0.5–0.6 mm, only as the pH becomes alkaline do small changes in Mg2+ significantly affect the rate. Fig. 7B shows the predicted flux as a function of pH at various free Mg2+ concentrations. Note that the effect of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ is to move the pH dependence to a point that the flux will be very sensitive to pH changes in the 7.2–7.8 range. It should also be noted that the range of fluxes shown have been limited to the maximum that could be sustained by the proton pumps of the respiratory chain. The flux at pH 7.4 and 0.5 mm Mg2+ is 400 nmol/min·mg, which is only 6.5% of the Jmax ([H+] = 0, [Mg2+] = 0), but still high enough so that in vivo, some other factor probably limits the flux further. Even though changes in Mg2+ may not be sufficient to regulate IMAC, the major function of Mg2+ may be to ensure that the channel is poised to be responsive to other factors that fine tune its activity and that it does not have excessive activity under physiological conditions. The large number of inhibitors that have so far been identified (1Beavis A.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12Powers M.F. Smith L.L. Beavis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10614-10620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Beavis A.D. Davatol-Hag H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) suggests that there is a very delicate balance between the open and closed states of IMAC. Many unidentified factors could be involved in regulating the open probability of IMAC. In addition to pH, these factors could include changes in matrix volume. As also suggested by others (8Jung D.W. Brierley G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1194-C1201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), volume per se could exert effects via cytoskeletal proteins that might be involved in control of mitochondrial shape and membrane folding. In view of the complex convoluted nature of the mitochondrial inner membrane and its cristae, this could provide a much more sensitive sensor of mitochondrial volume changes. Aon et al. (4Aon M.A. Cortassa S. Marbán E. O'Rourke B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44735-44744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) have recently proposed that superoxide may also activate IMAC. Thus, the question that remains is not whether IMAC can be active at physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and H+, but what other factors might increase its sensitivity to changes in mitochondrial volume.

The reduction in cyclic GMP causes closure of plasma membrane channels that are gated by this ligand and the onset of the photoresponse (reviewed in Stryer (43Stryer L. Annu. Rev.

Recovery of the photoresponse requires inactivation of each activated component of the phototransduction cascade. One of the central reactions responsible for the turnoff of the photoresponse is rhodopsin phosphorylation, catalyzed by the enzyme rhodopsin kinase. This phosphorylation reduces the rate of transducin activation by rhodopsin and enhances binding of arrestin to rhodopsin, which completely inhibits further transducin activation. It has been noted by several laboratories that illumination of ROS can lead to phosphorylation of not only photoexcited but also non-bleached rhodopsin (Bownds et al., 11Bownds M.D. Dawes J.

Up to 1400 phosphates were incorporated into non-bleached rhodopsin for each rhodopsin bleached by a flash of dim light (Binder et al., 8Binder B.M. Biernbaum M.S. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15333-15340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have called this phenomenon high gain rhodopsin phosphorylation. This gain diminishes at higher light levels when more than one rhodopsin per photoreceptor disc is bleached, and the amount of phosphorylated, non-bleached rhodopsin does not exceed ∼1% of the total rhodopsin pool. The gain also substantially diminishes when ROS are fragmented into smaller pieces prior to illumination (Binder et al., 8Binder B.M. Biernbaum M.S. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15333-15340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the integrity of the ROS structure seems so important for maintaining a high gain of non-bleached rhodopsin phosphorylation, we thought that it is possible that the efficiency of phosphorylation in electropermeabilized ROS might be much lower than in intact photoreceptors. We have now tested this idea by comparing the extent of non-bleached rhodopsin phosphorylation in electropermeabilized ROS and in intact photoreceptors, both on isolated retinas and in the living frog. Frog photoreceptors were used in this study because a large amount of rhodopsin can be harvested from a single animal and also because the highest gain of the non-bleached rhodopsin phosphorylation has been reported for frog (Binder et al., 8Binder B.M. Biernbaum M.S. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15333-15340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of the non-bleached rhodopsin phosphorylation in electropermeabilized ROS and isolated retinas were similar and reached ∼1% of the total rhodopsin pool. The highest level of the non-bleached rhodopsin phosphorylation, up to ∼3% of the total rhodopsin pool, was observed in rod photoreceptors of living animals exposed to relatively dim levels of background light (∼20 lx) for a time period of 30 min.DISCUSSIONPhosphorylation of unbleached rhodopsin in rod photoreceptors remains one of the least understood reactions in phototransduction. Even though the first indication for this reaction was obtained in one of the original papers describing the phenomenon of light-dependent rhodopsin phosphorylation (Bownds et al., 11Bownds M.D. Dawes J. Miller J. Stahlman M. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 237: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), its role in phototransduction remains unclear. We developed a chromatofocusing technique to further study this issue. The data presented indicate that the phosphorylation of non-bleached rhodopsin in intact photoreceptors is virtually the same as in electropermeabilized ROS. In isolated retinas this reaction reaches its maximum when ∼3% of the rhodopsin pool is bleached and declines with bleaching levels above this (Fig. 2A). This reduction at higher intensities of the test flash might be interpreted in the following way: if the bleached rhodopsin serves as a preferred substrate for the kinase (or kinases) responsible for the high gain phosphorylation, then the appearance of large amounts of photoexcited rhodopsin at higher light levels would efficiently compete with the non-bleached rhodopsin for interactions with the kinase (Dean and Akhtar, 17Dean K.R. Akhtar M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 881-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This explanation is consistent with the observation that phosphorylation of bleached rhodopsin at higher light levels is substantially increased (Fig. 2B).The most important observation in this study is that phosphorylation of non-bleached rhodopsin occurs in rod photoreceptors in living animals. Interestingly, the levels of both bleached and non-bleached rhodopsin phosphorylation in living animals reached a maximum at relatively moderate light intensities (∼20 lx) and then surprisingly diminished at higher light intensities. Two potential sources of this decrease in phosphorylation might be a shielding of ROS from light by the migration of pigment epithelium and by constriction of the iris.What Is the Functional Role of Non-bleached Rhodopsin Phosphorylation?The most commonly discussed idea concerning the role of non-bleached rhodopsin phosphorylation is that it plays a role in photoreceptor adaptation to high levels of background illumination (see Bownds and Arshavsky (9Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Behav. Brain Sci. 1995; 18: 415-424Crossref Google Scholar), for a review). If a substantial portion of non-bleached rhodopsin was to become phosphorylated during background illumination, its excitation should result in photoresponses with lowered amplitude and shorter duration characteristic of light adapted photoreceptors. The amplitude reduction would result from the reduced ability of phosphorylated rhodopsin to activate transducin, while the shorter duration of the response would result from faster binding of arrestin to pre-phosphorylated rhodopsin. The data reported here do not support this hypothesis. We have found that under optimal conditions of illumination not more 3% of the total unbleached rhodopsin pool in the rod photoreceptor becomes phosphorylated. Therefore, the probability that a photon would excite a phosphorylated rhodopsin is very low. However, our data obtained with rod photoreceptors do not exclude the possibility that the mechanism described above might be present in cones. Cones are known to adapt to higher levels of background light than rods, so they might use a different array of adaptation mechanisms from rods.One alternative hypothesis is that phosphorylation of a fraction of rhodopsin in the photoreceptor disc membrane causes changes in the membrane physical properties that modify the interaction of certain membrane-associated proteins. A hint for such a mechanism was obtained by Dizhoor et al. (18Dizhoor A.M. Arshavsky V.Y. Rubin V.O. Philippov P.P. Biol. Membr. 1985; 2: 272-276Google Scholar) who studied cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activation by transducin bound to a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP. In agreement with other reports (Fung and Nash, 21Fung B.K.-K. Nash C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10503-10509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Tyminski and O'Brien, 44Tyminski P.N. O'Brien D.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3986-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar; Malinski and Wensel, 32Malinski J.A. Wensel T.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9502-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) they found that membranes are required for an effective phosphodiesterase activation. They also found that photoreceptor membranes (either dark adapted or bleached) containing phosphorylated rhodopsin support phosphodiesterase activation less efficiently than membranes containing non-phosphorylated rhodopsin.How Can Non-bleached Rhodopsin Become Phosphorylated?The mechanism of unbleached rhodopsin phosphorylation remains to be determined. Recent studies have shown that upon binding to bleached rhodopsin, rhodopsin kinase becomes able to phosphorylate a rhodopsin C-terminal peptide corresponding to the major phosphorylation site (Fowles et al., 20Fowles C. Sharma R.P. Akhtar M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar; Palczewski et al., 38Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Kaplan M.W. Polans A.S. Crabb J.W. J. Biol Chem. 1991; 266: 12949-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps rhodopsin kinase also phosphorylates neighboring unbleached rhodopsin molecules. An alternative possibility is that another kinase acts on rhodopsin. Newton and Williams (35Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17725-17728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 1993)36Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18181-18186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar showed that rhodopsin is the major substrate for protein kinase C in ROS and suggested that this kinase may phosphorylate both bleached and non-bleached rhodopsin in ROS. A good way to distinguish between these two kinases is to study the effects of calcium on high gain rhodopsin phosphorylation. Calcium is shown to stimulate the activity of protein kinase C in ROS (Greene et al., 22Greene N.M. Williams D.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6710-6717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and suppress rhodopsin phosphorylation through the inhibitory action of recoverin on rhodopsin kinase (Klenchin et al., 25Klenchin V.A.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18060-18066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Our recent observations 2P. C. Calvert and M. D. Bownds, unpublished data. indicate that the high gain reaction is severalfold more active at 10 nM than at micromolar calcium levels which favors the role of rhodopsin kinase. This is in agreement with Chen et al. (14Chen C.-K. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18060-18066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) who have shown that purified rhodopsin kinase reconstituted with urea-treated bovine ROS membranes is able to catalyze high gain rhodopsin phosphorylation and that this reaction is sensitive to recoverin. Nevertheless, we do not exclude the possibility that both kinases are working at the same time.Another possible mechanism leading to the accumulation of non-bleached phosphorylated rhodopsin in photoreceptors is an inhibition of the dephosphorylation reaction without blocking rhodopsin regeneration by 11-cis-retinal. This possibility is discussed by Biernbaum et al. (7Biernbaum M.S. Binder B.M. Bownds M.D. Vis. Neurosci. 1991; 7: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that a dim background illumination prevents rhodopsin dephosphorylation in intact frog rods, but not in electropermeabilized ROS. In our study this option could only be realized in experiments with living animals since the endogenous content of 11-cis-retinal in isolated frog retinas is insufficient for regeneration of more than ∼1% of the rhodopsin pool (Baumann, 5Baumann C. Vision Res. 1970; 10: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar; Perlman et al., 40Perlman J.I. Nodes B.R. Pepperberg D.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 80: 885-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar; Cocozza and Ostroy, 15Cocozza J.D. Ostroy S.E. Vis. Res. 1987; 27: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our results are in general agreement with this hypothesis: the level of non-bleached rhodopsin phosphorylation under conditions permissive for regeneration of rhodopsin (living animals) is about 2-fold higher than under conditions where the opportunity for rhodopsin regeneration is limited (isolated retinas).A goal of future experiments is to elucidate the molecular mechanism that is responsible for phosphorylation of non-bleached rhodopsin and to determine whether this reaction plays a physiological role in vertebrate photoreceptors.

The reduction in cyclic GMP causes closure of plasma membrane channels that are gated by this ligand and the onset of the photoresponse (reviewed in Stryer (43Stryer L. Annu. Rev.

Recovery of the photoresponse requires inactivation of each activated component of the phototransduction cascade. One of the central reactions responsible for the turnoff of the photoresponse is rhodopsin phosphorylation, catalyzed by the enzyme rhodopsin kinase. This phosphorylation reduces the rate of transducin activation by rhodopsin and enhances binding of arrestin to rhodopsin, which completely inhibits further transducin activation. It has been noted by several laboratories that illumination of ROS can lead to phosphorylation of not only photoexcited but also non-bleached rhodopsin (Bownds et al., 11Bownds M.D. Dawes J.

In a NIH-3T3-derived cell line, N3T3, v-Abl blocks the serum-induced entry into S phase. In these G1-arrested cells v-Abl does not interfere with the activation of cyclin D1 or cyclin E-dependent kinases. As a result, v-Abl does not block the hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein RB. However, activation of cyclin A-dependent kinase is inhibited due to a v-Abl-induced block in the accumulation of cyclin A mRNA and protein. Ectopic expression of cyclin A enabled the v-Abl-arrested cells to enter S phase, whereas cyclins E and D1, or E2Fs 1 and 4 could not overcome the v-Abl arrest.

A number of cyclins have been identified and can be divided into at least three groups, the G1-cyclins, the S-cyclins and the G2/M-cyclins. Activation of the G1-cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) 1The abbreviations used are: Cdkcyclin-dependent kinaseCycAcyclin ACycEcyclin ECycDcyclin DRBprotein product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility genepRBhypophosphorylated RBppRBhyperphosphorylated RBT-AgSV40 large T-antigenPBSphosphate-buffered salineCSbovine calf serumRIPAradioimmune precipitation bufferFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate. drives the commitment to enter S phase. The function of cyclins can be deduced by (a) the timing of their expression, (b) the effect of anti-cyclin antibodies on the cell cycle, and (c) the effect of ectopic expression of cyclins. Cyclin D1 (CycD1), cyclin E (CycE), and cyclin A (CycA) are characterized as G1 cyclins. Consistent with this, antibodies to CycD1, -E, or -A can block entry into S phase (4Girard F. Strausfeld U.

Science. 1993; 259: 1908-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar).In mammalian cells, the identification of G1-cyclins has also been aided by the study of agents that cause G1 arrest. For example, transforming growth factor-β can block cells in G1 by inhibiting both the cyclin D (CycD)- and CycE-dependent kinases through the activation of inhibitors such as p15INK4B and p27Kip1 (10Polyak K. Kato J.Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar, 11Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J.

DNA-damaging agents, e.g. γ-irradiation, also block cells in G1 by inducing p21Cip1, an inhibitor of CycD-, CycE-, and CycA-associated kinases (13Dulic V. Kaufmann W.K. Wilson S.J. Tlsty T.D. Lees E.

Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7890) Google Scholar). A major target of phosphorylation by the cyclin-dependent kinases at the G1/S transition is the retinoblastoma protein, RB (15Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar). The initiation of RB phosphorylation during G1 is most likely catalyzed by the CycD-dependent kinases, Cdk4 and Cdk6 (15Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar, 16Wang J.Y. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The maintenance of RB phosphorylation from G1 to M phase may involve additional cyclin-dependent kinases. For example, the major RB-kinase in M phase cells is cyclin B/Cdc2 (17Lin B.T. Gruenwald S. Morla A.O. Lee W.H. Wang J.Y. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of RB is generally inhibited in G1-arrested cells, including those blocked by transforming growth factor-β or DNA damage (15Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar, 16Wang J.Y. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, RB phosphorylation is likely to be a key event in the progression through G1. However, it is unclear if RB phosphorylation is sufficient to drive entry into S phase.It has been shown previously that the oncogenic v-Abl tyrosine kinase can either transform or growth arrest NIH-3T3 cells (18Renshaw M.W. Kipreos E.T. Albrecht M.R. Wang J.Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3941-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on their response to v-Abl, two genetically stable subclones of NIH-3T3 cells (P3T3 and N3T3) were isolated. In the P3T3 cells v-Abl acts as an oncogene causing anchorage and growth factor-independent growth. In contrast, the N3T3 cells are growth-arrested by v-Abl. Using a temperature-sensitive allele of v-abl, we have shown that v-Abl blocks N3T3 cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. N3T3 cells stably expressing temperature-sensitive v-Abl (D4 cells) grow normally at 39°C, the restrictive temperature for kinase activity, but become G1-arrested at 32°C, the permissive temperature (18Renshaw M.W. Kipreos E.T. Albrecht M.R. Wang J.Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3941-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). When v-Abl is activated in S phase cells, no effect on the cell cycle progression is observed until the subsequent G1, showing that v-Abl acts only to block G1 but not other phases of the cell cycle. The N3T3 cells are also growth-inhibited by the Bcr-Abl oncogene, the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and the immunosuppressant rapamycin 2Y. Chen, E. S. Knudsen, and J. Y. J.

Determining the basis of the G1 block in N3T3 cells may define a cell cycle checkpoint, which must be overcome for v-Abl to have oncogenic potential.

The function of cyclins can be deduced by (a) the timing of their expression, (b) the effect of anti-cyclin antibodies on the cell cycle, and (c) the effect of ectopic expression of cyclins. Cyclin D1 (CycD1), cyclin E (CycE), and cyclin A (CycA) are characterized as G1 cyclins. Consistent with this, antibodies to CycD1, -E, or -A can block entry into S phase (4Girard F. Strausfeld U.

Science. 1993; 259: 1908-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar).In mammalian cells, the identification of G1-cyclins has also been aided by the study of agents that cause G1 arrest. For example, transforming growth factor-β can block cells in G1 by inhibiting both the cyclin D (CycD)- and CycE-dependent kinases through the activation of inhibitors such as p15INK4B and p27Kip1 (10Polyak K.

DNA-damaging agents, e.g. γ-irradiation, also block cells in G1 by inducing p21Cip1, an inhibitor of CycD-, CycE-, and CycA-associated kinases (13Dulic V. Kaufmann W.K. Wilson S.J. Tlsty T.D. Lees E.

A major target of phosphorylation by the cyclin-dependent kinases at the G1/S transition is the retinoblastoma protein, RB (15Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar). The initiation of RB phosphorylation during G1 is most likely catalyzed by the CycD-dependent kinases, Cdk4 and Cdk6 (15Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar, 16Wang J.Y. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The maintenance of RB phosphorylation from G1 to M phase may involve additional cyclin-dependent kinases. For example, the major RB-kinase in M phase cells is cyclin B/Cdc2 (17Lin B.T. Gruenwald S. Morla A.O. Lee W.H. Wang J.Y. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of RB is generally inhibited in G1-arrested cells, including those blocked by transforming growth factor-β or DNA damage (15Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar, 16Wang J.Y. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, RB phosphorylation is likely to be a key event in the progression through G1. However, it is unclear if RB phosphorylation is sufficient to drive entry into S phase.It has been shown previously that the oncogenic v-Abl tyrosine kinase can either transform or growth arrest NIH-3T3 cells (18Renshaw M.W. Kipreos E.T. Albrecht M.R. Wang J.Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3941-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on their response to v-Abl, two genetically stable subclones of NIH-3T3 cells (P3T3 and N3T3) were isolated. In the P3T3 cells v-Abl acts as an oncogene causing anchorage and growth factor-independent growth. In contrast, the N3T3 cells are growth-arrested by v-Abl. Using a temperature-sensitive allele of v-abl, we have shown that v-Abl blocks N3T3 cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. N3T3 cells stably expressing temperature-sensitive v-Abl (D4 cells) grow normally at 39°C, the restrictive temperature for kinase activity, but become G1-arrested at 32°C, the permissive temperature (18Renshaw M.W. Kipreos E.T. Albrecht M.R. Wang J.Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3941-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). When v-Abl is activated in S phase cells, no effect on the cell cycle progression is observed until the subsequent G1, showing that v-Abl acts only to block G1 but not other phases of the cell cycle. The N3T3 cells are also growth-inhibited by the Bcr-Abl oncogene, the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and the immunosuppressant rapamycin 2Y. Chen, E. S. Knudsen, and J. Y. J.

Determining the basis of the G1 block in N3T3 cells may define a cell cycle checkpoint, which must be overcome for v-Abl to have oncogenic potential."

Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Homologs have been found in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In rat, where CaM kinase II has been most intensively studied, diversity is generated both by multiple genes coding for separate α, β, γ, and δ isozymes, and by alternative splicing of these genes (2Bennett M.K. Kennedy M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1794-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 3Benson D.L. Isakson P.J. Gall C.M. Jones E.G. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14443-14449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major variability between isozymes and between alternatively spliced forms of a single isozyme occurs between the calmodulin (CaM) binding site and the association domain, where 11-41-amino acid “inserts” are found. The function of the variable region in the rat kinase is largely unknown, although early experiments have suggested that the affinity of α and β for CaM differ (6Miller S.G. Kennedy M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9039-9046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a recent report demonstrates a nuclear localization signal in the δB isoform (7Srinivasan M. Edman C.F. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).In Drosophila, where CaM kinase II is encoded by a single gene (8Cho K.O. Wall J.B. Pugh P.C. Ito M. Mueller S.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1991; 7: 439-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), up to 18 isoforms are generated by alternative splicing to form a variable region between the CaM binding and association domains (9Griffith L.C. Greenspan R.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1534-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Table I shows the organization of sequences found in the variable regions of the seven Drosophila CaM kinase II isoforms used in this study. The variable domain is made up of sequences from two independent exons termed insert 1 and insert 2. In addition to these amino acid cassettes, a glutamic acid and/or an alanine can be added to the ends of the domain by use of alternative splice acceptor sites. There is no sequence homology between the Drosophila and rat variable regions.TABLE IVariable regions of Drosophila CaM kinase II The structures of the variable regions of the isoforms of Drosophila CaM kinase II are shown. Splicing occurs in a region between the CaM binding domain and the association domain (9Griffith L.C. Greenspan R.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1534-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Variable size amino acid insertions occur at this site by alternative splicing of two independent exons (insert 1 and insert 2; for sequences see Ref. 9Griffith L.C. Greenspan R.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1534-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Additional variation is induced by the existence of multiple acceptor sites at the 5′ end of the insert 1 exon (leading to addition of a glutamic acid, E, at the beginning of the variable region) and multiple splice acceptor sites for the 3′ end of the insert exons (leading to addition of an alanine, A, to the end of the variable region).R1Insert 2R2Insert 2 + AR3No insertR3AAR4E + insert 1R5E + insert 1 + insert 2 + AR6Insert 1 + insert 2 Open table in a new tab An examination of the catalytic, assembly, and autophosphorylation properties of Drosophila isoforms R1-R6 demonstrated that these proteins are indeed CaM kinase II homologs (10GuptaRoy B. Griffith L.C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1282-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The only catalytic properties that showed any significant difference between isoforms were the Km for peptide substrate and the Kact for CaM, suggesting that the variable domain may influence the interaction between CaM and the catalytic domain. To investigate the function of CaM kinase II variable domains in activation by CaM, we have studied the interaction of this set of isoforms with a set of mutant CaMs with altered calcium binding and conformational properties. The use of the Drosophila isoforms allows unambiguous correlation of functional differences with the variable domain, since the proteins are otherwise identical. While the mammalian CaM kinase II isozymes show high homology outside this domain, they are not identical.The production of the active Ca2+/CaM complex has been studied extensively. Calcium binding to the four “EF” hands of CaM produces a conformational change required for activating target enzymes (for review, see Ref. 11Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. Elsevier, New York1988: 35Google Scholar). The crystal structure of calmodulin has shown that there are two calcium binding sites in both the amino and carboxyl termini of CaM, which form two globular domains separated by a central linker region (12Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J. Nature. 1985; 315: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 13Taylor D. Sack J.S. Maune J.F. Beckingham K. Quicho R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21375-21380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the detectable conformational changes of CaM are completed upon occupation of two of the four calcium binding sites. Several studies indicate that the carboxyl-terminal sites (3 and 4) bind calcium with higher affinity than the amino-terminal sites (1 and 2) and therefore binding in the carboxyl domain is the primary contributor to calcium-induced structural changes (14Yazawa M. Ikura M. Hikichi Ying L. Yagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10951-10954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yoshida M. Minowa O. Yagi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutants of Drosophila CaM have been generated, which incapacitate each calcium binding site individually (16Maune J.F. Klee C.B. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In each of these mutants, a conserved glutamic acid residue, which plays a critical role in calcium binding, at position 12 of one of the calcium binding loops has been mutated to either glutamine (Q) or lysine (K). Thus the B1Q mutant carries the glutamine mutation in binding site 1, while B1K has lysine at site 1, and so on. Calcium binding properties and conformational changes of these mutants and their ability to activate four target enzymes (skeletal myosin light chain kinase (skMLCK), smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (smMLCK), type I adenylyl cyclase, and Ca2+-ATPase) have been examined (16Maune J.F. Klee C.B. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Maune J.F. Beckingham K. Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have shown that, in both series of mutants, calcium binding at the mutated site is effectively eliminated over the calcium concentration range at which CaM functions and some component of the calcium-induced conformational change is also eliminated.We have used these CaM mutants to study the activation properties of seven isoforms of Drosophila CaM kinase II. In this report we show that, although the isoforms of CaM kinase II have similar biochemical properties (10GuptaRoy B. Griffith L.C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1282-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), they exhibit differential activation by mutant CaMs. The data support a role for the COOH-terminal variable regions of CaM kinase II in the mechanism of activation of this enzyme and demonstrate that stimulation of CaM kinase II catalytic activity by calmodulin is a multistep process, with separable binding and activation steps.DISCUSSIONThe data presented in this study provide information on the activation of CaM kinase II by calmodulin which can be interpreted at two levels. First, taken as a whole, the data are informative about the requirements of CaM kinase II for structural and functional properties of CaM, and about the mechanism of activation of CaM kinase II. This information comes from studying the rank orders of activation and binding and drawing conclusions based on the general properties of the population of isoforms. Second, the data provide evidence for distinct mechanisms of activation for the alternatively spliced isoforms of Drosophila CaM kinase II. These conclusions are based on examining absolute, rather than relative levels of activation, and from analyses of cases where specific isoforms behave differently than the population as a whole.Role of Calmodulin's Calcium Binding Sites in Activation of CaM Kinase IIStudies of the BK and BQ series of Drosophila CaM mutants have established that all of these mutants have greatly decreased calcium binding at the mutated site and some defect in calcium-induced conformational changes. In a previous study (20Gao Z.H. Krebs J. VanBerkum M.F.A. Tang W.J. Maune J.F. Means A.R. Stull J.T. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20096-20140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), three target enzymes of CaM, skMLCK, smMLCK, and type I adenylyl cyclase showed similar patterns of activation by the BK and BQ series CaM mutants. With the exception of poor activation of skMLCK by B1Q, mutations at site 4 were found to affect activation most severely followed by mutations at site 2 and site 3, and finally site 1. In earlier studies of UV circular dichroism (17Maune J.F. Beckingham K. Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), gel electrophoresis, and calcium binding (16Maune J.F. Klee C.B. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a similar ranking of the sites emerged.For the CaM kinase II isoforms, if one ranks the Kact values for each isoform for all the mutant CaMs and the binding effectiveness of each mutant for each isoform (Table IV), one finds that the same order is followed as for the other effector enzymes with two notable exceptions. First, the B1Q mutant is almost as detrimental for activation as mutations in binding site 4 (as was seen with skMLCK). B1Q also performs poorly in the binding assay. This is in contrast to B1K, which is both a good activator and able to compete effectively in the binding assay.Activation of CaM Kinase II Is a Multistep ProcessAlthough for most of the mutant CaMs, there is good correspondence between their ability to bind CaM kinase II and to activate the enzyme, the site 2 mutants are interesting in that they do not show this correlation. B2K does not bind well to any of the isoforms, yet it can activate some isoforms very well. Conversely, although B2Q binds CaM kinase II better than B2K, it is unable to activate the same isoforms to a similar extent. This is clearly seen in a comparison of the rank order of activation by B2K and B2Q with the rank order of CaM binding (Table IV). Dissociation of binding and activation is also seen with the R4 isoform, which binds to B1K, B2Q, and B3K better than any of the other isoforms, yet does not show enhanced activation by these CaMs (TABLE II., TABLE III). This lack of correlation between binding and increased enzyme activity implies that activation of CaM kinase II consists of at least two steps: binding of CaM to the target and subsequent stimulation of enzyme activity by the CaM/target complex. In this context, complexes formed between the CaM kinase II isoforms studied here and mutants B2K and B2Q could be very informative with regard to the mechanism of activation of this enzyme.Role of the Variable Domain in ActivationThe general properties of Drosophila CaM kinase II can be inferred from the rank orders of Kact and CaM binding for the mutant CaMs. While consensus emerges from such an analysis, there are indications that there are also isoform-specific effects for each of the mutant CaMs as measured by Kact. There are also some cases where a particular isoform diverges from the general rank order for activation.Analysis of the Effects of Isoform Variability on Activation by Binding Site 1 MutantsActivation of the seven isoforms of Drosophila CaM kinase II tested in this study was adversely affected by all of the mutant CaMs in the K and Q series. The CaM with the most normal activation kinetics, B1K, still showed an increase of 1.5-14-fold in Kact, depending on the isoform assayed. Structural modeling studies have indicated that at site 1, the mutation to lysine may be neomorphic and elicit some of the conformational changes normally induced by calcium (16Maune J.F. Klee C.B. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This meshes well with the activation data from four CaM target enzymes studied earlier, where it was shown to have a Kact only 1.5-2-fold greater than WT CaM (20Gao Z.H. Krebs J. VanBerkum M.F.A. Tang W.J. Maune J.F. Means A.R. Stull J.T. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20096-20140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the characteristics of B1K make it the mutant whose activation properties are most comparable to WT CaM.All the isoforms of CaM kinase II studied here showed nearly maximal stimulation by this mutant CaM at micromolar concentrations. The Kact values, however, differed from those seen with WT CaM and showed wider variation than did the other CaM effector enzymes tested previously. Since Kact and Vmax for WT CaM was virtually identical for all the isoforms (with the exception of R3A, which in other studies with WT bovine CaM had a significantly higher Kact value than other isoforms; Ref. 10GuptaRoy B. Griffith L.C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1282-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), it seems likely that the variations in activation by B1K are representative of some level of variable region-specific differences among the isoforms.The B1Q mutation has much more drastic effects on activation and binding than does the B1K mutation. Kact values range from 42- to 162-fold WT. Interestingly, although B1Q is one of the worst activators of Drosophila CaM kinase II, it is the least able to discriminate between isoforms. The difference between Kact values for the best and worst isoform is less than 4-fold. For all of the other mutants, the difference between best and worst is on the order of 10-20-fold. Since the B1K mutant may be neomorphic (17Maune J.F. Beckingham K. Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the role of binding site 1 is probably best understood by examining the data for the B1Q mutant. This suggests that calcium binding at site 1 and/or the conformational changes dependent on site 1 do not interact significantly with the variable domain of CaM kinase II. The defect in activation for CaM kinase II may be a direct result of the decreased ability of the B1Q mutant to bind, and may be independent of variable domain influence.Analysis of the Effects of Isoform Variability on Activation by Binding Site 2 MutantsFor binding site 2, enzyme activity data shows clear effects of isoform variability. B2K Kact values range from 1- to 10-fold WT, while for B2Q they range from 3- to 54-fold WT. For B2K and B2Q, three classes of activation patterns emerge. The first of these is R5 and R6 (which have both insert 1 and insert 2), which are relatively unaffected by both the mutations; the second class is R1, R2, R3, and R4 (having either insert 1 or insert 2 or no insert), which are more severely affected by B2Q and relatively unaffected by B2K; and the third is R3A (no insert, additional alanine), which is poorly activated by both the mutants. Thus mutations in binding site 2 not only separate binding and activation (see above), they can also discriminate between isoform variable regions.Analysis of the Effects of Isoform Variability on Activation by Binding Site 3 MutantsBinding site 3 mutants are fairly uniformly detrimental to CaM kinase II activation. The only notable differences among isoforms is that R5 and R6 (which both contain insert 1 and insert 2) are relatively less affected than the other isoforms (which have single or no inserts).Analysis of the Effects of Isoform Variability on Activation by Binding Site 4 MutantsThe binding site 4 mutants are overall the worst activators of CaM kinase II, with Kact values ranging from 13- to 145-fold WT for B4Q and from 30- to 295-fold WT for B4K. The most dramatic discrimination between isoforms is the difference seen in activation of R1 and R2, both of which contain insert 2, with R2 having an extra alanine. R1 and R2 are activated equivalently by B4Q, but activation by B4K is quite different, with the calculated Kact of R1 being 6-fold higher than the Kact of R2. A difference of this magnitude implies that the addition of an alanine residue to the end of the variable domain has significant structural consequences, and that the variable domain is an active participant in stimulation of enzyme activity by the CaM/target complex.Importance of Isoform-specific InteractionsThe interaction of CaM kinase II with CaM is unusual. Most Ca2+/CaM effectors interact with CaM with subnanomolar-nanomolar affinities. CaM kinase II in its unphosphorylated state shows dissociation constants in the 25-100 nM range (1Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 21Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). This contrasts with data for peptides based on the rat CaM kinase II CaM binding domain, which have a KD of 0.1-0.3 nM (1Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). For the native rat cytoskeletal CaM kinase II, the binding constant for 125I-CaM was found to be >10-fold less than Kact (22LeVine III, H. Sahyoun N.E. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, autophosphorylation can modulate the affinity of CaM kinase II for CaM, increasing affinity by 3 orders of magnitude (21Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). There is evidence that regions of skMLCK that are outside the CaM binding region interact with the first domain of CaM (23Zot H.G. Aden R. Samy S. Puett D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14796-14801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations that affect smMLCK activation but not binding have also been characterized (24Su Z. Fan D. George S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16761-16765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Determinants other than the core CaM binding sequence are therefore very important to the binding of Ca2+/CaM by CaM kinase II. Using site-directed CaM mutants, we have shown here that isoforms of CaM kinase II that are structurally different show differences in their mechanisms of activation.As indicated by the above analyses, the correlation between the structure of the isoform and its activation is not uniform for different binding site mutants or for different mutations at the same binding site. If one examines these relative sensitivities, however, several generalizations can still be made. First, R1, R3, and R3A are usually the most sensitive to CaM mutations. Second, R4, R5, and R6 are usually most insensitive. R2 is quite variable, sometimes among the most sensitive, sometimes among the least. The differential sensitivity of the isoforms to mutations in the high or low affinity calcium binding sites could be indicative of selectivity in the pattern of isoforms activated at different subsaturating intracellular calcium concentrations. This diversity in activation of the Drosophila isoforms by mutant CaMs indicates that sequence variability in this region may regulate activation of CaM kinase II. Examination of the distribution of the kinase isoforms by mRNA in situ hybridization to adult tissue has revealed no remarkable differences (9Griffith L.C. Greenspan R.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1534-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The functional in vivo consequences of the regulatory diversity we have demonstrated remain to be determined.

Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Homologs have been found in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In rat, where CaM kinase II has been most intensively studied, diversity is generated both by multiple genes coding for separate α, β, γ, and δ isozymes, and by alternative splicing of these genes (2Bennett M.K. Kennedy M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1794-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 3Benson D.L. Isakson P.J. Gall C.M. Jones E.G. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14443-14449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major variability between isozymes and between alternatively spliced forms of a single isozyme occurs between the calmodulin (CaM) binding site and the association domain, where 11-41-amino acid “inserts” are found. The function of the variable region in the rat kinase is largely unknown, although early experiments have suggested that the affinity of α and β for CaM differ (6Miller S.G. Kennedy M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9039-9046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a recent report demonstrates a nuclear localization signal in the δB isoform (7Srinivasan M. Edman C.F. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).In Drosophila, where CaM kinase II is encoded by a single gene (8Cho K.O. Wall J.B. Pugh P.C. Ito M. Mueller S.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1991; 7: 439-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), up to 18 isoforms are generated by alternative splicing to form a variable region between the CaM binding and association domains (9Griffith L.C. Greenspan R.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1534-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Table I shows the organization of sequences found in the variable regions of the seven Drosophila CaM kinase II isoforms used in this study. The variable domain is made up of sequences from two independent exons termed insert 1 and insert 2. In addition to these amino acid cassettes, a glutamic acid and/or an alanine can be added to the ends of the domain by use of alternative splice acceptor sites. There is no sequence homology between the Drosophila and rat variable regions.TABLE IVariable regions of Drosophila CaM kinase II The structures of the variable regions of the isoforms of Drosophila CaM kinase II are shown. Splicing occurs in a region between the CaM binding domain and the association domain (9Griffith L.C. Greenspan R.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1534-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Variable size amino acid insertions occur at this site by alternative splicing of two independent exons (insert 1 and insert 2; for sequences see Ref. 9Griffith L.C. Greenspan R.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1534-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Additional variation is induced by the existence of multiple acceptor sites at the 5′ end of the insert 1 exon (leading to addition of a glutamic acid, E, at the beginning of the variable region) and multiple splice acceptor sites for the 3′ end of the insert exons (leading to addition of an alanine, A, to the end of the variable region).R1Insert 2R2Insert 2 + AR3No insertR3AAR4E + insert 1R5E + insert 1 + insert 2 + AR6Insert 1 + insert 2 Open table in a new tab An examination of the catalytic, assembly, and autophosphorylation properties of Drosophila isoforms R1-R6 demonstrated that these proteins are indeed CaM kinase II homologs (10GuptaRoy B. Griffith L.C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1282-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The only catalytic properties that showed any significant difference between isoforms were the Km for peptide substrate and the Kact for CaM, suggesting that the variable domain may influence the interaction between CaM and the catalytic domain. To investigate the function of CaM kinase II variable domains in activation by CaM, we have studied the interaction of this set of isoforms with a set of mutant CaMs with altered calcium binding and conformational properties. The use of the Drosophila isoforms allows unambiguous correlation of functional differences with the variable domain, since the proteins are otherwise identical. While the mammalian CaM kinase II isozymes show high homology outside this domain, they are not identical.The production of the active Ca2+/CaM complex has been studied extensively. Calcium binding to the four “EF” hands of CaM produces a conformational change required for activating target enzymes (for review, see Ref. 11Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. Elsevier, New York1988: 35Google Scholar). The crystal structure of calmodulin has shown that there are two calcium binding sites in both the amino and carboxyl termini of CaM, which form two globular domains separated by a central linker region (12Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J. Nature. 1985; 315: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 13Taylor D. Sack J.S. Maune J.F. Beckingham K. Quicho R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21375-21380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the detectable conformational changes of CaM are completed upon occupation of two of the four calcium binding sites. Several studies indicate that the carboxyl-terminal sites (3 and 4) bind calcium with higher affinity than the amino-terminal sites (1 and 2) and therefore binding in the carboxyl domain is the primary contributor to calcium-induced st"

Previous studies employing purified enzymes and adozelesin-modified template DNAs suggested that adozelesin-DNA adducts inhibit DNA replication at the level of nascent DNA chain elongation. In this study, neutral/neutral two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis was employed to analyze simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication intermediates recovered from adozelesin-treated SV40 virus-infected cells. SV40 replication intermediates rapidly disappeared from infected cells when they were treated with adozelesin, but not when the cells were also treated with aphidicolin to block maturation of replicating SV40 DNA. We conclude that the disappearance of SV40 replication intermediates induced by adozelesin treatment was a consequence of maturation of these intermediates in the absence of new initiation events. Adozelesin inhibition of nascent chain elongation is first observed at concentrations above those needed to block initiation. Adozelesin treatment inhibits SV40 DNA replication at concentrations that produce adducts on just a small fraction of the intracellular population of SV40 DNA molecules.

INTRODUCTIONAdozelesin (U-73,975) is a synthetic analog of the antitumor antibiotic CC-1065 (1Warpehoski M.A. Gebhard I. Kelly R.C. Krueger W.C. Li L.H. McGovren J.P. Prairie M.D. Wicnienski N. Wierenga W. J. Med. Chem. 1988; 31: 590-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The cytotoxic activity of adozelesin is orders of magnitude more potent than many common antineoplastic agents such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, or cytosine arabinoside (2Bhuyan B.K. Smith K.S. Adams E.G. Petzold G.L. McGovren J.P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5687-5692PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bhuyan B.K. Smith K.S. Adams E.G. Wallace T.L. Von Hoff D.D. Li L.H. Cancer Chemother.

It is highly effective against a broad spectrum of murine tumors and human tumor xenografts without the lethal hepatotoxicity caused by CC-1065 (7Li L.H. Kelly R.C. Warpehoski M.A. McGovren J.P. Gebhard I. DeKoning T.F. Invest. New Drugs. 1991; 9: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Adozelesin was chosen for clinical development based upon this in vivo potency and efficacy, and is currently undergoing phase II clinical evaluation (8Fleming G.F. Ratain M.J. O'Brien S.M. Schilsky R.L. Hoffman P.C. Richards J.M. Vogelzang N.J. Kasunic D.A. Earhart R.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994; 86: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).A primary intracellular target of adozelesin is DNA (3Bhuyan B.K. Smith K.S. Adams E.G. Wallace T.L. Von Hoff D.D. Li L.H. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1992; 30: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Weiland K.L. Dooley T.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7559-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Like CC-1065, adozelesin elicits its potent cytotoxic and antitumor effects by alkylating DNA (10Zsido T.J. Beerman T.A. Meegan R.L. Woynarowski J.M. Baker R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, adozelesin is composed of three heterocyclic subunits linked serially by amide bonds. Similar to the parent compound, CC-1065, this structure conforms to the curved shape of DNA by mimicking the twist of the helix and allowing the drug to bind within the minor groove in a sequence-specific manner (11Sun D.

The indole and benzofuran substituents of adozelesin (Fig. 1, subunits B and C, respectively) form non-covalent interactions with DNA that may contribute to the sequence preference of the drug (11Sun D.

These non-covalent interactions cause bending and stiffening of the DNA helix (11Sun D. Hurley L.H. Anti-Cancer Drug Design. 1992; 7: 15-36PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sun D. Hurley L.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2822-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 13Sun D. Hurley L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 1773-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After binding to the minor groove, the cyclopropyl ring of the left-hand cyclopropylpyrroloindole substituent (Fig. 1) forms a covalent bond with N-3 of adenine at the 3′ end of the binding site (23Hurley L.H. Reynolds V.L. Swenson D.H. Petzold G.L. Scahill T.A. Science. 1984; 226: 843-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 24Reynolds V.L. Molineux I.J. Kaplan D.J. Swenson D.H. Hurley L.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Two consensus sequences have been identified for this alkylation event: 5′-(A/T)(A/T)A* and 5′-(A/T)(G/C)(A/T)A*, where A* is the alkylated 3′ adenine (9Weiland K.L. Dooley T.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7559-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Lee C.S. Pfeifer G.P. Gibson N.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6024-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Inhibition of DNA synthesis as a result of damage to the DNA template is a common cellular effect of alkylating antitumor agents (25Colvin M. Chabner B.A. Chabner B.A. Collins J.M. Cancer Chemotherapy: Principles and Practice. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1990: 276Google Scholar), including adozelesin (3Bhuyan B.K. Smith K.S. Adams E.G. Wallace T.L. Von Hoff D.D. Li L.H. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1992; 30: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 5Cote S. Momparler R.L. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 1993; 4: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this inhibitory effect is that DNA adducts formed by adozelesin and other alkylating agents directly inhibit replication fork progression at the site of adduct formation. This model is supported by cell-free studies, which show that the presence of adozelesin-DNA adducts blocks the progression of DNA polymerase (3Bhuyan B.K. Smith K.S. Adams E.G. Wallace T.L. Von Hoff D.D. Li L.H. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1992; 30: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Weiland K.L. Dooley T.P.

Chem. 1992; 35: 1773-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and inhibits helicase-mediated unwinding of the DNA duplex (12Sun D. Hurley L.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2822-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 13Sun D. Hurley L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 1773-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).However, the precise mechanism by which adozelesin inhibits intracellular DNA replication is unknown. In this study, the intracellular effects of adozelesin on DNA replication were examined using simian virus 40 (SV40) 1The abbreviations used are: SV40simian virus 40BSC-1African green monkey kidney cellsRIsreplication intermediatesoriorigin of replicationFIform I DNAFIIform II DNAFIIIform III DNA[3H]TdR[methyl-3H]thymidine.-infected African green monkey kidney cells (BSC-1) as a well defined DNA replication model. Except for the virally encoded large tumor antigen, SV40 DNA replication is completely dependent upon the enzymatic machinery of the host cell (26Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1972; 10: 591-598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the examination of DNA damage and drug effects on DNA replication is facilitated by the small (5 kilobase pairs) circular structure of SV40 and the high copy number to which it replicates in infected cells.The effects of adozelesin on SV40 DNA replication were analyzed by neutral/neutral two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (27Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), which cleanly separates replicating from non-replicating DNA on the basis of the unique nonlinear structure of DNA replication intermediates (RIs). This technique was used to assay the number and replication status of SV40 RIs isolated from control and adozelesin-treated cells infected with SV40 virus. In addition to examining effects on replication, the number of adozelesin-DNA adducts that form on SV40 DNA at different concentrations of adozelesin was quantitated. The results demonstrated that low concentrations of adozelesin primarily block SV40 DNA replication at the level of initiation of nascent DNA chains in the absence of significant amounts of adduct formation on SV40 DNA.DISCUSSIONThe nature of the extraordinary cytotoxicity of adozelesin and related alkylating minor groove binding drugs is not known. Like many antitumor agents, these compounds inhibit DNA replication, and one possibility is that their cytotoxicity is related to the inhibitory effect they have on this fundamental cellular process. As part of our continuing effort to better understand the cytotoxic effects of this and related compounds, the objective of this study was to determine the mechanism by which adozelesin inhibits SV40 DNA replication.Cell-free DNA replication studies have shown that adozelesin-DNA adducts block the progression of bacterial polymerases along template DNA and inhibit the unwinding of duplex DNA by purified helicases (3Bhuyan B.K. Smith K.S. Adams E.G. Wallace T.L. Von Hoff D.D. Li L.H. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1992; 30: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Weiland K.L. Dooley T.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7559-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11Sun D. Hurley L.H. Anti-Cancer Drug Design. 1992; 7: 15-36PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sun D. Hurley L.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2822-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 13Sun D. Hurley L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 1773-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We recently showed that CC-1065, which is another member of the cyclopropylpyrroloindole class of compounds, forms DNA adducts at specific sites in the SV40 genome in SV40-infected cells (28McHugh M.M. Woynarowski J.M. Mitchell M.A. Gawron L.S. Weiland K.L. Beerman T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9158-9168Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). With this in mind, our initial two-dimensional gel analysis was designed to detect SV40 DNA replication forks accumulated at specific sites due to the ability of adducts to arrest DNA polymerization or unwinding of template DNA.Contrary to our expectation that adozelesin treatment would cause SV40 RIs to accumulate, we observed a dose- and time-dependent reduction in SV40 RIs in adozelesin-treated cells (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). This contrasts with the large numbers of SV40 RIs observed by two-dimensional gel analysis when the maturation of SV40 RIs has been blocked by treatment with elongation inhibitors such as aphidicolin (31Gilbert D.M. Neilson A. Miyazawa H. DePamphilis M.L. Burhans W.C. J Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 9597-9606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In fact, large numbers of SV40 RIs were observed in adozelesin-treated cells when these cells were also treated with aphidicolin to block maturation of previously formed replication intermediates (Fig. 6). These results definitively establish that the reduction in SV40 RIs observed in association with adozelesin treatment alone is caused by the maturation of SV40 RIs in the absence of new initiation events. Furthermore, when tritiated thymidine incorporation into residual RIs was measured in cells treated with partially inhibitory doses of adozelesin, it became apparent that adozelesin's inhibitory effect on initiation of SV40 DNA replication is not accompanied by significant inhibitory effect on nascent DNA chain elongation (Fig. 9).The nature of the inhibitory effects on initiation of SV40 DNA replication induced by adozelesin is not clear. The drug has no detectable reactivity with protein (9Weiland K.L. Dooley T.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7559-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and DNA adduct formation by the cyclopropyl moiety of adozelesin and other members of this family of drugs is essential for the biological activity of these compounds (1Warpehoski M.A. Gebhard I. Kelly R.C. Krueger W.C. Li L.H. McGovren J.P. Prairie M.D. Wicnienski N. Wierenga W. J. Med. Chem. 1988; 31: 590-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, adozelesin's inhibitory effects on initiation are likely related to formation of adozelesin-DNA adducts rather than interactions between adozelesin and DNA replication proteins or noncovalent interactions between adozelesin and DNA.Since it is likely that adozelesin-DNA adducts form at specific sequences (similar to its parent compound CC-1065), an alternative possibility is that the expression of genes coding for proteins specifically involved in initiation of SV40 DNA replication is blocked by adducts that selectively form within such genes or nearby regulatory sequences.These genes most likely would be cellular genes rather than the viral gene, which encodes the single viral protein involved in SV40 DNA replication, large T antigen. This is because the number of adducts formed on SV40 DNA is not sufficient to account for the complete inhibition of large T antigen gene expression required to abolish SV40 DNA replication. Furthermore, adozelesin also inhibits cellular DNA replication in mammalian cells in the absence of viral proteins. 2W. C. Burhans and T. A. Beerman, unpublished observations. In either case, the fact that significant inhibition of RIs occurs within 1 h suggests that the cellular or viral proteins coded for by these genes would have rapid turnover rates.Alternatively, adozelesin's inhibitory effects on initiation of SV40 DNA replication may result from the induction of a cellular DNA damage response that occurs independently of where adozelesin-DNA adducts are formed. For instance, it was recently demonstrated that inhibition of DNA replication in budding yeast by the DNA damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate is part of a checkpoint response mediated by the RAD53 and MEC1 genes (36Paulovich A.G. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1995; 82: 841-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). We recently determined that adozelesin also inhibits DNA replication in this organism in a RAD53- and MEC1-dependent manner. 3M. Weinberger and W. C. Burhans, unpublished observations. Thus, adozelesin's inhibitory effect on DNA replication in budding yeast clearly is related to the S phase checkpoint regulatory response mediated by these two genes.Whether or not adozelesin's inhibitory effect on initiation of SV40 DNA replication corresponds to a similar response in mammals is not known. However, considerable circumstantial evidence is consistent with this possibility. For instance, SV40 DNA replication also is inhibited in SV40 infected cells or cells containing replicating SV40 episomes when DNA damage is induced in these cells by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation (37Murnane J.P. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similarly, DNA damage induced by compounds that methylate DNA inhibits the replication of episomes containing Epstein-Barr virus sequences (38Zhukovskaya N. Branch P. Aquilina G. Karran P. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2189-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Similar to the replication arrest induced by adozelesin, DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation (39Cleaver J.E. Rose R. Mitchell D.L. Radiat. Res. 1990; 124: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Cleaver J.E. Radiat. Res. 1992; 131: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 41Lamb J.R. Petit-Frere C. Broughton B.C. Lehmann A.R. Green M.H. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1989; 56: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and DNA methylation (38Zhukovskaya N. Branch P. Aquilina G. Karran P. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2189-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) inhibit SV40 or Epstein-Barr virus episome DNA replication in association with levels of viral or episomal DNA damage, which are too small to account for replication arrest induced by the formation of adducts on individual molecules of replicating viral or episomal DNA.Presumably, the inhibition of episomal or viral DNA replication induced by ultraviolet or ionizing radiation is related the transient decrease in cellular DNA replication, which is also induced by DNA damage (38Zhukovskaya N. Branch P. Aquilina G. Karran P. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2189-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In fact, a large number of studies suggest one component of the cellular response to DNA damage induced by these agents corresponds to an inhibitory effect on initiation of new replicons (37Murnane J.P. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This component is detected at low levels of DNA damage and is also accompanied by an inhibitory effect on elongation when DNA damage is increased. Similarly, the predominant initiation inhibitory effect on SV40 DNA replication induced by adozelesin at low concentrations is also accompanied by a pronounced inhibitory effect on elongation of nascent DNA chains at higher doses of drug (Fig. 9). Adozelesin also induces a transient arrest of cellular DNA replication in mammals (2Bhuyan B.K. Smith K.S. Adams E.G. Petzold G.L. McGovren J.P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5687-5692PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bhuyan B.K. Smith K.S. Adams E.G. Wallace T.L. Von Hoff D.D. Li L.H. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1992; 30: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), although it is not known whether adozelesin's inhibitory effect on cellular DNA replication occurs at the level of initiation or elongation.The discovery of a unique mode of action for adozelesin by two-dimensional gel techniques demonstrates the tremendous utility of these powerful techniques for studying at the molecular level, the effects on DNA replication of compounds that target DNA. Most previous attempts to distinguish between initiation- and elongation-specific effects on DNA replication relied on the indirect analysis of nascent DNA intrinsically labeled with radioactive DNA precursor molecules, such as tritiated thymidine. The interpretation of this type of experiment is problematic due to the uncertainties inherent in the analysis of intrinsically labeled DNA. These uncertainties are related to factors such as differences in the rate of fork movement, effects of the size of intracellular precursor pools on radiolabel incorporation, radiolabel incorporation due to DNA repair, and potential inhibitory effects on DNA replication related to the radioisotopic labeling of DNA. In contrast, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis techniques for analyzing DNA replication directly identify replicating DNA independently of an intrinsic label. This feature of two-dimensional techniques is responsible for their enormous effectiveness as tools for studying various aspects of DNA replication in recent years, and made possible detection of adozelesin's initiation-specific effect on SV40 DNA replication.The application of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis technology to study the effects of other inhibitors of SV40 and cellular DNA replication may identify additional initiation-specific effects similar to the inhibitory effect induced by adozelesin. The ability to selectively inhibit initiation of SV40 DNA replication could prove useful in efforts to dissect the cellular processes involved in initiation of cellular DNA replication, including those steps involved in cellular responses to DNA damage. We are exploring these possibilities, as well as the potential relationship between the initiation-specific inhibitory effect of adozelesin on SV40 DNA replication and the profound cytotoxic effects that may underlie the efficacy of this drug as an antitumor agent. INTRODUCTIONAdozelesin (U-73,975) is a synthetic analog of the antitumor antibiotic CC-1065 (1Warpehoski M.A. Gebhard I. Kelly R.C. Krueger W.C. Li L.H. McGovren J.P. Prairie M.D. Wicnienski N. Wierenga W. J. Med. Chem. 1988; 31: 590-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The cytotoxic activity of adozelesin is orders of magnitude more potent than many common antineoplastic agents such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, or cytosine arabinoside (2Bhuyan B.K. Smith K.S. Adams E.G. Petzold G.L. McGovren J.P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5687-5692PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bhuyan B.K. Smith K.S. Adams E.G. Wallace T.L. Von Hoff D.D. Li L.H. Cancer Chemother.

It is highly effective against a broad spectrum of murine tumors and human tumor xenografts without the lethal hepatotoxicity caused by CC-1065 (7Li L.H. Kelly R.C. Warpehoski M.A. McGovren J.P. Gebhard I. DeKoning T.F. Invest. New Drugs. 1991; 9: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Adozelesin was chosen for clinical development based upon this in vivo potency and efficacy, and is currently undergoing phase II clinical evaluation (8Fleming G.F. Ratain M.J. O'Brien S.M. Schilsky R.L. Hoffman P.C. Richards J.M. Vogelzang N.J. Kasunic D.A. Earhart R.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994; 86: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).A primary intracellular target of adozelesin is DNA (3Bhuyan B.K. Smith K.S. Adams E.G. Wallace T.L. Von Hoff D.D. Li L.H. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1992; 30: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Weiland K.L. Dooley T.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7559-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Like CC-1065, adozelesin elicits its potent cytotoxic and antitumor effects by alkylating DNA (10Zsido T.J. Beerman T.A. Meegan R.L. Woynarowski J.M. Baker R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, adozelesin is composed of three heterocyclic subunits linked serially by amide bonds. Similar to the parent compound, CC-1065, this structure conforms to the curved shape of DNA by mimicking the twist of the helix and allowing the drug to bind within the minor groove in a sequence-specific manner (11Sun D.

The indole and benzofuran substituents of adozelesin (Fig. 1, subunits B and C, respectively) form non-covalent interactions with DNA that may contribute to the sequence preference of the drug (11Sun D.

These non-covalent interactions cause bending and stiffening of the DNA helix (11Sun D. Hurley L.H. Anti-Cancer Drug Design. 1992; 7: 15-36PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sun D. Hurley L.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2822-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 13Sun D. Hurley L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 1773-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After binding to the minor groove, the cyclopropyl ring of the left-hand cyclopropylpyrroloindole substituent (Fig. 1) forms a covalent bond with N-3 of adenine at the 3′ end of the binding site (23Hurley L.H. Reynolds V.L. Swenson D.H. Petzold G.L. Scahill T.A. Science. 1984; 226: 843-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 24Reynolds V.L. Molineux I.J. Kaplan D.J. Swenson D.H. Hurley L.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Two consensus sequences have been identified for this alkylation event: 5′-(A/T)(A/T)A* and 5′-(A/T)(G/C)(A/T)A*, where A* is the alkylated 3′ adenine (9Weiland K.L. Dooley T.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7559-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Lee C.S. Pfeifer G.P. Gibson N.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6024-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Inhibition of DNA synthesis as a result of damage to the DNA template is a common cellular effect of alkylating antitumor agents (25Colvin M. Chabner B.A. Chabner B.A. Collins J.M. Cancer Chemotherapy: Principles and Practice. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1990: 276Google Scholar), including adozelesin (3Bhuyan B.K. Smith K.S. Adams E.G. Wallace T.L. Von Hoff D.D. Li L.H. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1992; 30: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 5Cote S. Momparler R.L. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 1993; 4: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this inhibitory effect is that DNA adducts formed by adozelesin and other alkylating agents directly inhibit replication fork progression at the site of adduct formation. This model is supported by cell-free studies, which show that the presence of adozelesin-DNA adducts blocks the progression of DNA polymerase (3Bhuyan B.K. Smith K.S. Adams E.G. Wallace T.L.

https://openalex.org/W1999811028,"In cholera toxin-treated gastric chief cells, incubation with a cholinergic agonist (carbamylcholine), a regulatory peptide (cholecystokinin), or a calcium ionophore (A23187) causes a dose- and time-dependent potentiation of cAMP levels. Because this augmented response is calcium/calmodulin-dependent, we hypothesized that it was mediated by calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B). To test this hypothesis, we examined the actions of calcineurin inhibitors on secretagogue-induced potentiation of cAMP levels in guinea pig chief cells. Preincubation of cells with 0.1 µM FK-506 completely prevented carbachol-induced augmentation of cAMP levels and pepsinogen secretion from cholera toxin-treated cells. Cyclosporin-A, another calcineurin inhibitor, also prevented the augmented cAMP response. FK-506 and cyclosporin inhibited augmentation of cAMP levels following treatment with cholecystokinin(26-33) and A23187, but not the smaller increase in cAMP following treatment with a phorbol ester that activates protein kinase C. Hence, the actions of calcineurin inhibitors were limited to secretagogues that increase cellular calcium. Rapamycin, an agent that competes with FK-506 for the immunophilin, FK binding protein 12, does not inhibit calcineurin. In the present study, preincubation with rapamycin did not prevent carbachol-induced augmentation of cAMP levels in cholera toxin-treated chief cells. However, a molar excess of rapamycin reversed the inhibitory actions of FK-506. These experiments provide further evidence that the actions of FK-506 on cholera toxin-treated gastric chief cells are caused by its inhibitory actions on calcineurin. FK-506 also inhibited potentiation of cAMP levels when carbachol was added to cells that were preincubated with forskolin, an agent that directly activates adenylyl cyclase. We conclude that, in gastric chief cells, calcineurin mediates cross-talk between the calcium/calmodulin and adenylyl cyclase signaling pathways.

We conclude that, in gastric chief cells, calcineurin mediates cross-talk between the calcium/calmodulin and adenylyl cyclase signaling pathways. Several years ago, we discovered a novel interaction between the calcium- and adenylyl cyclase-mediated signal transduction pathways in gastric chief cells (1Raufman J-P. Cosowsky L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5957-5962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, preincubation with cholera toxin followed by a second incubation with agents that increase intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]iintracellular calcium concentrationcarbacholcarbamylcholineCCKcholecystokinin(26-33)FKBP12FK-506 binding protein 12ACTHadrenocorticotropinPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateIBMX3-isobutyl 1-methylxanthine. results in potentiation of pepsinogen secretion. Similar potentiation of enzyme secretion has been demonstrated in other exocrine tissues (e.g. pancreatic acini (2Gardner J.D. Rottman A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 585: 250-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 3Pan G-Z. Collen M.J. Gardner J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 720: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar)). However, in contrast to observations in other tissues (2Gardner J.D. Rottman A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 585: 250-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 3Pan G-Z. Collen M.J. Gardner J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 720: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), in cholera toxin-treated chief cells, potentiation of enzyme secretion by agents that increase [Ca2+]i is mediated by an augmentation in cellular levels of cAMP (1Raufman J-P. Cosowsky L. J. Biol.

We observed that in cholera toxin-treated chief cells, incubation with a cholinergic agonist (carbamylcholine (carbachol)), a regulatory peptide (cholecystokinin(26-33) (CCK)), or a calcium ionophore (A23187) caused an approximate 2-fold dose- and time-dependent augmentation of cAMP levels. These agents did not alter cAMP levels in control cells that had not been treated with cholera toxin. The calcium-dependence of this effect was demonstrated by showing that potentiation of cAMP levels could be abolished by incubating cells in a calcium-free medium or in the presence of inhibitors of calmodulin (1Raufman J-P. Cosowsky L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5957-5962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Raufman J-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we reported that phorbol esters that activate protein kinase C also potentiate cAMP levels in cholera toxin-treated chief cells (4Raufman J-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, when compared to agents that increase [Ca2+]i, phorbol esters are about 50% as efficacious in increasing levels of cAMP (4Raufman J-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Moreover, the additive response in cAMP levels that is observed when maximal concentrations of a phorbol ester and a calcium ionophore are combined indicates that these agents act by different mechanisms. Hence, we concluded that at least two different signaling pathways interact with adenylyl cyclase to augment cellular levels of cAMP (4Raufman J-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Calcineurin (also referred to as protein phosphatase-2B), a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase, appears to play a role in signal transduction in a variety of tissues (for reviews, see Refs. 5Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar and 6Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). As with other phosphatases which had once been thought to play only a constitutive role in preparing substrates for the actions of kinases, it is now believed that calcineurin is an active component of signaling cascades (7Tan Y.H. Science. 1993; 262: 376-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 8Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). Examination of the actions of calcineurin has been facilitated by the discovery of relatively specific inhibitors. These include cyclosporin-A, a cyclic undecapeptide produced by the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum, and FK-506, a macrolide antibiotic obtained from the bacterium Streptomyces tsukubanensis. The inhibitory actions of these agents on calcineurin are dependent on binding to endogenous immunophilins, cyclophilin, and FK-binding protein 12 (FKBP12), respectively, within cells (9Kunz J. Hall M.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 334-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 10MacKintosh C. MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem.

Using these inhibitors and other methods, investigators have reported that calcineurin regulates neutrophil chemokinesis (13Hendey B. Klee C.B. Maxfield F.R.

Commun. 1995; 215: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We have observed that FK-506 inhibits calcium- and carbachol-induced pepsinogen secretion from permeabilized and intact chief cells, respectively (18Malhotra R. Raffaniello R. Raufman J-P. Gastroenterology. 1993; 104: A139Google Scholar). Regarding our observations in gastric chief cells, Baukal et al. (19Baukal A.J. Hunyady L. Catt D.J. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24546-24549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that calcineurin mediates a potentiating interaction involving adenylyl cyclase in bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells. In glomerulosa cells, angiotensin II potentiates the increase in cAMP caused by adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). Preincubation of glomerulosa cells with cyclosporin A or FK-506 inhibits angiotensin-induced potentiation of the increase in cAMP caused by ACTH (19Baukal A.J. Hunyady L. Catt D.J. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24546-24549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the above findings and the observation in chief cells that augmentation of cholera toxin-induced increases in cAMP is calcium/calmodulin-dependent, we hypothesized that this potentiated response was mediated by calcineurin. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by examining the actions of calcineurin inhibitors on secretagogue-induced potentiation of cAMP levels in cholera toxin-treated gastric chief cells. Male Hartley guinea pigs (150-175 g) were obtained from Camm Research Lab Animals, Wayne, NJ; collagenase (type 1), bovine albumin (fraction V), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), carbamylcholine (carbachol), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and EGTA from Sigma; cholera toxin, rapamycin, and A23187 from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA); basal medium (Eagle's) amino acids (100 times concentrated) and essential vitamin solution (100 times concentrated) from Grand Island Biological, Grand Island, NY; Percoll from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; 125I-albumin from ICN; cholecystokinin(26-33) (CCK) from Peninsula Labs. (Belmont, CA); and, cAMP 2′-O-succinyl-[125]iodotyrosine methyl ester and cAMP antiserum (preconjugated to a second antibody) from Du Pont NEN (Boston, MA). Cyclosporin A and FK-506 were kindly provided by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (NJ) and Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Corp. (Osaka, Japan), respectively. Dispersed chief cells from guinea pig stomach were prepared as described previously (20Raufman J-P. Sutliff V.E. Kasbekar D.K. Jensen R.T. Gardner J.D. Am. J.

Physiol. 1984; 247: G95-G104PubMed Google Scholar, 21Raufman J-P. Berger S. Cosowsky L. Straus E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Physiol. 1986; 251: G96-G102PubMed Google Scholar), chief cells constituted at least 85% of the total cell population and trypan blue exclusion was greater than 95%. The cells were washed and resuspended in standard incubation solution containing 24.5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 98 mM NaCl, 6 mM KCl, 2.5 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM MgCl2, 11.5 mM glucose, 5 mM sodium fumarate, 5 mM sodium pyruvate, 5 mM sodium glutamate, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 2 mM glutamine, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1% (v/v) amino acid mixture, and 1% (v/v) essential vitamin mixture. IBMX (100 µM) was added to the incubation solution when changes in cellular cAMP were determined. The standard incubation solution was equilibrated with 100% O2, and all incubations were performed with 100% O2 as the gas phase. Pepsinogen secretion was determined as described previously (21Raufman J-P. Berger S. Cosowsky L. Straus E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using 125I-albumin substrate and expressed as the percentage of total cellular pepsinogen that was released into the medium during the incubation. Cellular cAMP was determined by radioimmunoassay using the procedure described previously (22Sutliff V.E. Raufman J-P. Jensen R.T. Gardner J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: G96-G102PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of chief cells in the incubate was adjusted to maintain cAMP on the linear portion of the standard curve. Statistical evaluation was performed using Student's t test on paired values, or ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test when comparing multiple values to a single control. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. As illustrated by the open symbols in Fig. 1A, over the course of a 2-h incubation in the presence of IBMX, an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, chief cell cAMP levels remained relatively constant at approximately 2-5 pmol/106 cells. In cells incubated with 0.1 µM cholera toxin, there was a steady increase in cAMP to approximately 40 pmol/106 cells by 90 min, after which a plateau was attained with little, if any, further increase in cAMP. In control cells, the addition of 100 µM carbachol at 90 min did not alter cellular cAMP, whereas, in cholera toxin-treated cells, a further increase in cAMP was observed within 15 min of adding the cholinergic agonist and by 32 min was more than 2-fold greater than values observed with cholera toxin alone. In the absence of cholera toxin, addition of the calcineurin inhibitor FK-506 did not alter levels of cAMP. Although in this and some other experiments, the addition of FK-506 appeared to decrease cholera toxin-induced levels of cAMP (compare solid circles to diamonds in Fig. 1A) these changes were not significant (p > 0.05, Student's t test). Nevertheless, as shown by the solid triangles (partially obscured by the solid circles) in Fig. 1A, preincubation of cells with FK-506 plus cholera toxin completely prevented carbachol-induced potentiation of cAMP levels. Fig. 1B shows the dose-response curve for carbachol-induced potentiation of the cAMP response in cholera toxin-treated chief cells. The actions of the cholinergic agonist were detectable with 1 and maximal with 100 µM carbachol. This is the same range of concentrations that causes an increase in intracellular calcium and stimulates pepsinogen secretion (1Raufman J-P. Cosowsky L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5957-5962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Raufman J-P. Sutliff V.E. Kasbekar D.K. Jensen R.T. Gardner J.D. Am. J.

Preincubation of chief cells with 0.1 µM FK-506 plus cholera toxin completely prevented carbachol-induced potentiation of the cAMP response (Fig. 1B). To determine whether protein synthesis was necessary to mediate potentiation of cAMP levels in cholera toxin-treated cells, we examined the actions of cyclohexamide, a inhibitor of protein synthesis. As shown in Table I, in cholera toxin-treated cells, the addition of 100 µg/ml cyclohexamide did not alter the actions of carbachol or the inhibitory effects of FK-506. Hence, protein synthesis is not required for carbachol-induced potentiation of cAMP levels in cholera toxin-treated cells.Table I.Lack of effect of cyclohexamide on carbachol-induced augmentation of cAMP levels in cholera toxin-treated chief cells Dispersed chief cells were first incubated for 90 min at 37°C with 0.1 µM cholera toxin alone or cholera toxin plus 0.1 µM FK-506, in the absence or presence of 100 µg/ml cyclohexamide. Cells were incubated for an additional 30 min at 37°C with or without 100 µM carbachol. Cellular cAMP was measured following the second incubation. In each experiment each value was determined in duplicate and results given are means ± S.E. from three separate experiments.AdditionscAMP (pmol/106 cells)NoneCarbachol (100 µM)Cholera toxin, 0.1 µM29.4 ± 3.371.8 ± 10.2aIndicates results that are significantly greater than those obtained in the absence of carbachol (p < 0.05, Student's t test).Cholera toxin + 100 µg/ml cyclohexamide31.5 ± 3.883.2 ± 9.0aIndicates results that are significantly greater than those obtained in the absence of carbachol (p < 0.05, Student's t test).Cholera toxin + 0.1 µM FK-50624.0 ± 3.423.8 ± 3.8Cholera toxin + FK-506 + 100 µg/ml cyclohexamide25.1 ± 1.226.8 ± 2.0a Indicates results that are significantly greater than those obtained in the absence of carbachol (p < 0.05, Student's t test). Open table in a new tab To determine whether the addition of a calcineurin inhibitor would also prevent carbachol-induced potentiation of pepsinogen secretion from cholera toxin-treated chief cells, we examined the effects of FK-506 on cells that were preincubated for 90 min with or without cholera toxin and then incubated for an additional 30 min with or without carbachol (Fig. 2). In cells that had been incubated without cholera toxin for 90 min, pepsinogen secretion during the second 30-min incubation was increased approximately 4-fold by the addition of 100 µM carbachol (from 2.0 ± 1.4% with no additions to 7.9 ± 0.4% with carbachol, mean ± S.E. from three experiments). Secretion during the second incubation from cells that were preincubated for 90 min with 0.1 µM cholera toxin and then incubated with no additions for an additional 30 min was the same as that from cells preincubated without cholera toxin. However, potentiation of pepsinogen secretion was observed when cholera toxin-treated cells were incubated for an additional 30 min with carbachol. That is, during the 30-min incubation following the addition of carbachol to cholera toxin-treated cells, pepsinogen secretion was more than twice the sum of secretion observed with carbachol and cholera toxin acting alone (see horizontal line in Fig. 2). Although pepsinogen secretion seemed diminished when FK-506 was added to control or cholera toxin-treated cells (Fig. 2), these changes were not significant (p > 0.05, Student's paired t test). In contrast, FK-506 significantly decreased secretion caused by carbachol alone or by carbachol plus cholera toxin. Secretion from cholera toxin-treated cells that were incubated with carbachol plus FK-506 was not significantly different from the calculated additive value for the effects of carbachol and cholera toxin acting alone (horizontal line in Fig. 2). These results indicate that calcineurin plays a role in mediating carbachol-induced pepsinogen secretion and potentiation of secretion in cells that are treated with carbachol plus cholera toxin. Hence, in cholera toxin-treated chief cells, addition of a calcineurin inhibitor prevents potentiation of both the cAMP and secretory response when cells are incubated for an additional period with carbachol. Because previous studies (4Raufman J-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) indicated that other agonists could augment the cAMP response in cholera toxin-treated chief cells, we examined the effect of FK-506 on the actions of these agents. As illustrated in Fig. 3, in addition to carbachol, a regulatory peptide (CCK), a calcium ionophore (A23187), and a phorbol ester (PMA) increased cAMP in cholera toxin-treated cells. These agonists did not alter cAMP in cells that were not pretreated with cholera toxin (data not shown). With the exception of the modest response caused by PMA, augmentation in cAMP levels observed with these agonists in cholera toxin-treated cells was prevented by incubation with FK-506. These results indicate that a variety of agents that increase chief cell calcium concentration can augment cAMP levels in cholera toxin-treated chief cells. Likewise, these actions can be prevented by adding a calcineurin inhibitor. In contrast, PMA, an agent that does not increase cell calcium concentration, causes only a minimal increase in cAMP levels that is not altered by preincubation with FK-506 (Fig. 3). To verify that the actions of FK-506 on chief cell cAMP were caused by inhibition of calcineurin, we examined the actions of cyclosporin-A, another inhibitor of this phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 4A, in cells that had not been preincubated with cholera toxin, carbachol, and CCK did not alter basal cAMP levels. Likewise, neither FK-506 nor cyclosporin-A altered basal cAMP levels. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 4B, cholera toxin incubation for 90 min increased cAMP levels to approximately 35 pmol/106 cells. The addition of carbachol and CCK at 90 min increased cAMP levels to 70 and 60 pmol/106 cells, respectively, after an additional 30-min incubation. This augmentation of cAMP levels was prevented by incubation with either FK-506 or cyclosporin-A supporting the hypothesis that these actions are mediated by calcineurin. Next, we compared the dose-response curves for the abilities of FK-506, cyclosporin A, and okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase-1 and −2A inhibitor, to inhibit carbachol-induced augmentation of cAMP in cholera toxin-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 5, the order of potency for these inhibitors was FK-506 > cyclosporin > okadaic acid. Whereas FK-506 and cyclosporin are efficacious in the nanomolar range, okadaic acid concentrations less than 0.3 µM have no effect on the augmented response. It has been reported previously that at micromolar concentrations, the actions of okadaic acid become less specific and the agent can inhibit calcineurin (10MacKintosh C. MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 444-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To validate further the use of FK-506 and cyclosporin A as specific calcineurin inhibitors, we examined the actions of rapamycin. Like FK-506, rapamycin, an antibiotic produced by the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus, binds to FKBP12 (9Kunz J. Hall M.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 334-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 10MacKintosh C. MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 444-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 11Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Nature Medicine. 1995; 1: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, unlike the FK-506·FKBP12 complex, the rapamycin·FKBP12 complex does not inhibit calcineurin. Because FK-506 and rapamycin compete for FKBP12, a molar excess of rapamycin should diminish the ability of FK-506 to inhibit calcineurin (9Kunz J. Hall M.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 334-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 10MacKintosh C. MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem.

As shown in Fig. 6, rapamycin alone did not alter cAMP levels in cholera toxin-treated cells. Whereas, incubation with FK-506 prevented carbachol-induced potentiation of cAMP levels, rapamycin had no effect. Moreover, rapamycin reversed the inhibitory effects of FK-506. In contrast, rapamycin did not alter the inhibitory effects of cyclosporin A on carbachol-induced potentiation of cAMP levels. This result is expected because unlike FK-506 or rapamycin which compete for FKBP12, cyclosporin A binds to a different immunophilin, cyclophilin (9Kunz J. Hall M.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 334-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 10MacKintosh C. MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem.

These data provide evidence that the actions of FK-506 demonstrated in these studies are specific and mediated by inhibition of calcineurin by the FK-506·FKBP12 complex. To localize the site of calcineurin action in augmenting the cAMP response, we examined the actions of forskolin, a plant alkaloid that acts directly on adenylyl cylase to stimulate an increase in cAMP. Table II shows the effects of forskolin, with or without carbachol, on cAMP levels in dispersed chief cells. Forskolin alone caused an approximate 8-fold increase in cellular cAMP. The addition of carbachol almost doubled the cAMP response. As observed with cholera toxin-treated cells, in forskolin-treated cells, the addition of FK-506 blocked carbachol-induced potentiation of cAMP levels.Table II.Augmentation of cAMP levels by carbachol in forskolin-treated chief cells Dispersed chief cells were first incubated for 15 min at 37°C alone, with 0.1 µM FK-506, 1 µM forskolin, or forskolin plus FK-506. Cells were then incubated for an additional 30 min at 37°C with or without 100 µM carbachol. Cellular cAMP was measured following the second incubation. In each experiment each value was determined in duplicate and results given are means ± S.E. from three separate experiments.AdditionscAMP (pmol/106 cells)NoneCarbachol (100 µM)None9.7 ± 0.815.7 ± 2.0 NSaNS, value with carbachol not significantly different than control (p < 0.05, Student's t test).FK-506, 0.1 µM8.6 ± 1.08.9 ± 1.3Forskolin, 1 µM51.8 ± 5.178.9 ± 9.8bIndicates that result is significantly greater than that obtained in the absence of carbachol (p < 0.05, Student's t test).Forskolin + FK-50640.4 ± 7.038.0 ± 7.1a NS, value with carbachol not significantly different than control (p < 0.05, Student's t test).b Indicates that result is significantly greater than that obtained in the absence of carbachol (p < 0.05, Student's t test). Open table in a new tab Calcineurin (protein phosphatase-2B) plays a role in signal transduction in a variety of secretory cells (5Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 6Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 7Tan Y.H.

In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that, in gastric chief cells, inhibition of calcineurin decreases calcium-mediated pepsinogen secretion and dephosphorylation of cytoskeletal phosphoproteins (18Malhotra R. Raffaniello R. Raufman J-P. Gastroenterology. 1993; 104: A139Google Scholar, 23Malhotra R. Raffaniello R. Raufman J-P. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: A824Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that, in gastric chief cells, calcineurin mediates an interaction between the calcium and adenylyl cyclase signaling systems that results in augmentation of cAMP levels and potentiation of pepsinogen secretion. Specifically, in chief cells preincubated with cholera toxin, inhibition of calcineurin activity prevents augmentation of cAMP levels and secretion caused by agents that increase cellular calcium concentration. Evidence that this calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase plays an important role in mediating these potentiating interactions includes the following observations: (a) augmentation of cAMP levels in cholera toxin-treated cells is caused by agents like carbachol, CCK, and A23187 that increase [Ca2+]i (Refs. 1Raufman J-P. Cosowsky L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5957-5962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Raufman J-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, and the present paper); (b) the cAMP response requires the presence of extracellular calcium (1Raufman J-P. Cosowsky L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5957-5962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (c) inhibitors of calmodulin, like trifluoperazine or calmidazolium, block the augmented response (1Raufman J-P. Cosowsky L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5957-5962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Raufman J-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar); and, (d) preincubation of cells with inhibitors of calcineurin, like FK-506 and cyclosporin A, prevents augmentation of the cAMP and secretory responses (present paper). The specificity of FK-506 and cyclosporin A for calcineurin is demonstrated by the observation that rapamycin, a competitor for FKBP12, blocks the inhibitory actions of FK-506 but not those of cyclosporin A. Although high concentrations of okadaic acid inhibited augmentation of cAMP levels, it is likely that this is caused by the previously reported promiscuity of this agent at micromolar concentrations (10MacKintosh C. MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 444-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Moreover, in in vivo systems it is not possible to control completely the stoichiometry of these interactions. That is, although one can add a known quantity of the inhibitor to the cell suspension, one does not know how much calcineurin is present. Hence, if chief cells contain relatively small amounts of calcineurin, nonspecific actions of high concentrations of okadaic acid are more likely (10MacKintosh C. MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 444-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Dissection of the locus of action of calcineurin in mediating augmentation of chief cell cAMP levels is possible from the observations reported here. This action is not likely to be caused by a change in receptor number or affinity for the various agonists used in this study. This is evident because carbachol and CCK interact with different classes of receptors (24Raufman J-P. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 699-710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and A23187 is a divalent cation ionophore. Likewise, an action on cholera toxin receptors is unlikely because the augmented response occurs 90 min after the cells were first exposed to the toxin and cAMP levels have reached a plateau. An action of calcineurin on cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases is unlikely because these studies were performed in the presence of IBMX, an inhibitor of these enzymes. We have shown previously that adding IBMX facilitates experiments by increasing the amount of cAMP in these cells, but that its presence is not required for observing augmentation of cAMP levels (1Raufman J-P. Cosowsky L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5957-5962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that cyclohexamide does not alter the actions of carbachol or FK-506 provides evidence that the augmented response is not caused by the actions of calcineurin on gene expression. Hence, based on these exclusions, the most likely target for calcineurin in mediating augmentation of cAMP levels is adenylyl cyclase. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that carbachol-induced potentiation of cAMP in cells treated with forskolin, an agent that acts directly on adenylyl cyclase, is also blocked by preincubation with FK-506. Calcineurin may act directly on an isoform of adenylyl cyclase or it could activate a signaling cascade in which another phosphatase or kinase is activated to act on the cyclase. The adenylyl cyclases are a fast growing family with as many as 10 isoforms (25Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 18: 536-542Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 26Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Karpen J.W.

Commun. 1995; 214: 1000-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These isoforms differ with respect to regulation by guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, calcium/calmodulin and protein kinase C (24Raufman J-P. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 699-710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 18: 536-542Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 26Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Based on analysis of these differences when adenylyl cyclase isoforms are expressed in HEK 293 cells (25Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 18: 536-542Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (117) Google Scholar), investigators have separated the isoforms into three groups. Group I, consisting of isoforms I, III, and VIII, is stimulated by increases in calcium/calmodulin (28Tang W.-J. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8595-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Choi E.J. Xia Z. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6492-6498Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 30Cali J.J. Zwaagstra J.C. Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Krupinski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12190-12195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, matters are complicated further by the observation that adenylyl cyclase isoform III may be stimulated by calcium/calmodulin in vitro, but inhibited by these agents in vivo (31Wayman G.A. Impey S. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21480-21486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This latter observation raises the possibility of a dynamic interaction wherein calcineurin activates an isoform of adenylyl cyclase that was previously inactivated by calmodulin-kinase II-mediated phosphorylation. Interaction with a different isoform of adenylyl cyclase may explain the different pattern of action observed in the present studies with PMA, an activator of protein kinase C. The modest PMA-induced augmentation in the cAMP response, that is not inhibited by FK-506, may be caused by actions of protein kinase C on an isoform (e.g. II or VII) that is not calcium/calmodulin sensitive (25Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 18: 536-542Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To test hypotheses regarding the actions of calcineurin and protein kinase C in gastric chief cells it will be necessary to determine which adenylyl cyclase isoforms are expressed in these cells and to examine directly the actions of calcium/calmodulin and calcineurin on phosphorylation of these isoforms and on other potential substrates. In conclusion, in gastric chief cells, calcineurin regulates a form of cross-talk between the calcium/calmodulin and adenylyl cyclase signaling systems that results in augmentation of cAMP production and pepsinogen secretion. As has been hypothesized for the brain (32Lu Y-F. Hayashi Y. Moriwaki A. Tomizawa K. Matsui H. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 205: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and other organs (19Baukal A.J. Hunyady L. Catt D.J. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24546-24549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), such potentiating interactions may serve an important purpose by providing “fine-tuning” and/or amplification of secretory responses. Redundancy in signaling pathways may also provide an evolutionary advantage should one pathway fail or be blocked. Finally, in the pathophysiological state of infection with Vibrio cholera, the potentiating interactions shown here may worsen the clinical manifestations of gastrointestinal hypersecretion. Cholinergic antagonists, inhibitors of other agents that stimulate the calcium/calmodulin signaling pathway, and possibly inhibitors of calcineurin may ameliorate this disease."

Ann. Intern. Med. 1993; 118: 211-218Google Scholar). Like HIV-1, HIV-2 can cause AIDS, but typically the asymptomatic period following HIV-2 infection is much longer than that following HIV-1 infection. Genetically, HIV-2 is quite different from HIV-1 and only shares ~40% nucleic acid sequence similarity (1Markovitz D.M. Ann. Intern. Med. 1993; 118: 211-218Google Scholar, 2Guyader M. Emerman M. Sonigo P. Clavel F. Montagnier L. Alizon M. Nature. 1987; 326: 662-669Google Scholar). Different transcriptional enhancer elements which respond to T cell stimulation in the enhancers of these two viruses may explain, in part, the clinical differences observed between persons infected with HIV-1 and HIV-2. Unlike HIV-1, in which the two κB sites play the dominant role in regulating inducible enhancer function in activated T cells (3Markovitz D.M. Hannibal M. Perez V.L. Gauntt C. Folks T.M. Nabel G.J.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3551-3558Google Scholar), HIV-2 enhancer activation in T cells is regulated by at least four distinct cis-acting elements: two purine-rich sites (PuB1 and PuB2), which bind the ets proto-oncogene family member Elf-1; the peri-ets, or pets site, which binds a protein described below; and a single κB site, which binds the well described components of NF-κB (3Markovitz D.M.

Clark N. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5035-5040Google Scholar). A fifth element, the peri-κB site, mediates HIV-2 enhancer induction in monocytic cells but not in T cells (12Clark N. Hannibal M.C. Markovitz D.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4854-4862Google Scholar). While these five sites are not present in HIV-1, they are conserved in a wide range of HIV-2 isolates. Mutation of any of these elements markedly diminishes the response of the enhancer to cellular activation but does not affect the response to tat or to other viral transactivating proteins. Therefore, these elements specifically mediate enhancer stimulation in activated T cells or monocytes and serve as the final common mediators in signal transduction pathways. human immunodeficiency virus human T cell leukemia virus polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis electrophoretic mobility shift assay dithiothreitol high performance liquid chromatography murine leukemia virus T cell receptor β-chain. The pets site is a TG-rich element (TTGGTCAGGG) found between the two Elf-1 binding sites in the HIV-2 enhancer (Fig. 1). We have demonstrated the functional importance of this site in the activation of the HIV-2 enhancer in both T cells and monocytes (8Markovitz D.M. Smith M. Hilfinger J. Hannibal M.C. Petryniak B. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5479-5484Google Scholar, 9Hilfinger J. Clark N. Robinson K. Smith M. Markovitz D.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4448-4453Google Scholar). The pets element mediates activation whether the enhancer is stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate alone, phytohemagglutinin alone, phorbol myristate acetate plus phytohemagglutinin, soluble antibodies to the T cell receptor, immobilized antibodies to the T cell receptor, or by antigen (3Markovitz D.M.

Clark N. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5035-5040Google Scholar). We and others have also demonstrated that a similar TG-rich pets-like site, again adjacent to an Elf-1 binding site, plays a significant role in mediating activation of the human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) enhancer in stimulated T cells (13Clark N. Smith M. Hilfinger J. Markovitz D.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5522-5528Google Scholar, 14Tanimura A. Teshima H. Fujisawa J-L. Yoshida M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5375-5382Google Scholar). TG-rich sites adjacent to the ets-binding sites are also found in murine retroviruses, and alteration of these pets-like sites can change the type of malignancy seen in mice following infection (15Speck N.A. Renjifo B. Golemis E. Fredrickson T.N. Hartley J.W. Hopkins N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 233-242Google Scholar). Therefore pets-like elements adjacent to ets-binding sites appear to play an important role in the enhancers of retroviruses and serve as a final common mediator for signal transduction pathways in monocytes and especially T cells. In this report, we describe the biochemical purification of the pets factor and show that it is a 43-kDa protein. This conclusion is based on glycerol gradient sedimentation, Southwestern blotting, DNase footprinting using highly purified extracts obtained through chromatographic separation, and on a newly developed competitive UV cross-linking assay. To characterize the native molecular mass of the pets factor, we purified the protein from bovine spleen nuclear extracts using DNA affinity chromatography and separated the purified protein using glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation. Bovine spleen was selected because a high level of pets binding activity was found in this abundantly available, inexpensive tissue. In addition, preliminary data, confirmed in the experiments described below, showed the bovine and human pets factors to be the same size and hence, presumably, the same protein. SDS-PAGE and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis of the glycerol gradient fractions revealed that the pets factor co-sedimented with ovalbumin, a 43-kDa internal control standard. We also performed UV cross-linking in solution using both crude bovine spleen nuclear extracts and highly purified pets factor to show that the predominant protein binding specifically to the pets site in vitro is a 43-kDa protein. Southwestern blotting experiments show that in cultured human T cells, as well as bovine spleen nuclear extracts, the predominant protein binding specifically to the pets site is 43 kDa in molecular mass. Having extensively characterized the molecular mass of the pets factor, we purified it to homogeneity from bovine spleen and showed that the purified pets factor, which is capable of protecting the HIV-2 pets site in a DNase I footprinting assay, is a 43-kDa protein. Furthermore, the 43-kDa purified protein, after band extraction and elution from SDS-PAGE, is capable of site specific binding to the pets element upon renaturation. Taken together, these results, from many different types of experimental assays, indicate that a specific cellular protein of 43 kDa is the major protein which binds to the pets site of the HIV-2 enhancer. This protein is therefore likely to be the pets factor, which mediates transcriptional activation and signal transduction pathways. Fresh bovine spleens (~1 kg each) were obtained from a slaughter house and approximately one-half of one spleen was used per purification run. The following steps were performed at 4°C: the spleens were finely diced and homogenized in a blender for 30 s on highest speed in 4 liters of buffer H (250 mM sucrose, 50 mM HEPES, pH 6.5, 25 mM KCl, 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The nuclei and connective tissue were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min. The nuclear proteins were then extracted by hard shaking in 1.6 liters of buffer E (250 mM sucrose, 400 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by incubation for 30 min. The nuclear extract was then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by the gradual addition of ammonium sulfate to 50% saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min and stored in aliquots at −70°C. The following steps were performed at 4°C: for each column run, the ammonium sulfate precipitate from half of a spleen was resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and dialyzed overnight against 100 times its volume of buffer A. The dialysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 60 min, and successively filtered through 2.7- and 1.6-µm glass fiber filters (Whatman) to clarify the protein solution before loading onto a column packed with 250 ml of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow resin (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Following loading, the column was washed with 2 liters of buffer A or until the absorbance at 280 nm returned to baseline. Proteins bound to the column were eluted with 10 bed volumes of a 100 mM KCl stepwise gradient. The binding activity, as measured by EMSA, typically eluted at 400-500 mM KCl. Positive fractions were then pooled and dialyzed against buffer A before loading onto a 40-ml heparin-agarose (Bio-Rad) column. The procedures for subsequent washing and elution were the same as for the Q-Sepharose chromatography. The binding activity elutes at around 300 mM KCl. DNA affinity chromatography was performed using a DNA-Sepharose column and the method of Kadonaga and Tjian (16Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Google Scholar), with the pets oligonucleotide used in EMSAs. The positive fractions eluted from the heparin column were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and loaded onto a 2-ml DNA affinity column at gravity flow. During the first pass over the DNA affinity column, 12 µg of calf thymus DNA was added as a nonspecific competitor per mg of protein applied to the column. The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer A and bound proteins were eluted with 10 ml of buffer A containing 1 M KCl. The eluate was diluted to 100 mM KCl in buffer A and reapplied to a newly prepared 1-ml DNA affinity column. To precipitate the eluted proteins, trichloroacetic acid was added to 10% final concentration in the presence of 200 µg/ml sodium deoxycholate. After incubation on ice for 60 min, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min and washed once with acetone before it was resolubilized in 100 µl of 3 M guanidine HCl (or 6 M urea for SDS-PAGE), 0.05 M Tris, pH 8.5, 25 mM DTT. 5 µl were analyzed on SDS-PAGE, and the remainder was injected onto a C4 reverse phase column (Vydac). Proteins were eluted using a 0 to 100% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and the 220-nm absorbance peaks were collected and analyzed by silver staining after SDS-PAGE. Density gradient centrifugation was performed according to the method of Martin and Ames (17Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Google Scholar), with the following modifications. After 2 successive rounds of DNA affinity chromatography, 100 µl of the eluate was mixed with 50 µg each of lysozyme, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and alcohol dehydrogenase and layered onto a 7-ml 10-25% glycerol gradient in buffer A without DTT. After 21 h of centrifugation at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman SW-41 rotor, a Beckman fractionator was used to collect 40 aliquots. Each fraction was assayed for binding activity (EMSA) and silver staining after SDS-PAGE. The specific binding activity was measured by counting the 32P cpm in the EMSA shifted bands using a β-scanner (Betagen). SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Sample buffer contained 50 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mM DTT, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol. Prestained molecular mass standards were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Silver staining was performed as described by Wray et al. (19Wray W. Boulikas Y. Wray V. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Google Scholar). Jurkat nuclear extract was prepared by a modification of the method of Dignam et al. (20Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). Purified pets factor was prepared as described above. A radiolabeled probe corresponding to nucleotides −107 to −189 (Fig. 1) was prepared, and DNase I protection assays were performed as described previously (3Markovitz D.M. Hannibal M. Perez V.L. Gauntt C. Folks T.M. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9098-9102Google Scholar, 8Markovitz D.M. Smith M. Hilfinger J. Hannibal M.C. Petryniak B. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5479-5484Google Scholar, 21Dyan W.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Google Scholar, 22Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Google Scholar). Purified proteins were concentrated in Centricons (Amicon) before use in DNase I footprinting. Oligonucleotides corresponding to both strands of the HIV-2 sequence from −162 to −131 but with the PuB2 site mutated (Fig. 1) were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems 300B synthesizer. The sequence of the pets site oligonucleotide used in EMSA was: 5′-GATCCAGCTATACTTGGTCAGGGCGAATTCTAACTA. The sequence of the mutated pets oligonucleotide was: 5′-GATCCAGCTATACTGTCGGGCGAATTCTAACTA. Equimolar amounts of the two strands were combined, boiled for 1 min in 0.5 M NaCl, and allowed to cool gradually. The double-stranded oligonucleotide was then radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and unincorporated nucleotide was then removed using a Sephadex G-50 column. The binding reactions were performed as described previously (8Markovitz D.M. Smith M. Hilfinger J. Hannibal M.C. Petryniak B. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5479-5484Google Scholar). 200 µg of Jurkat or bovine extract was separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidine difluoride membrane with a semi-dry electroblotter (Fisher Scientific) in 16 mM Tris, 120 mM glycine, and 20% methanol. The blot was blocked in buffer A containing 5% dry milk (Carnation) at room temperature for 60 min with gentle shaking before incubation in buffer A containing 6 M urea and 50 mM DTT for 60 min at room temperature. The blot was then incubated overnight at 4°C in buffer A and was then reblocked as above for 30 min, rinsed, and hybridized to an 8x-pets concatemeric probe (see below) at 1 × 106 cpm/ml in buffer A with a range of concentrations of calf thymus DNA (Fig. 6) for 60 min at room temperature. To remove excess probe, the blot was washed for 30 min at room temperature with 3 changes of 100 ml of buffer A before autoradiography. Purified proteins (see above) were precipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE and the region corresponding to the 43-kDa prestained molecular mass marker was excised. The 43-kDa protein was extracted from the gel slice and renatured by the method of Hager and Burgess (23Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 76-86Google Scholar), except that the protein was renatured by dialysis against buffer A on a 0.025-µm filter (Millipore). UV cross-linking was performed in solution with crude spleen extracts or purified pets factor using a bromouridine-substituted probe as described elsewhere (24Travis A. Hagman J. Hwang L. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3392-3400Google Scholar) with modifications. UV cross-linking was performed on ice for 40 min. DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) and T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) were also cross-linked to the same probe in other reactions and then used in the assay to estimate the effect of the cross-linked probe on migration through SDS-PAGE of a protein of known size. Specific and nonspecific oligonucleotide competitors were added to each reaction as indicated in Fig. 3. When purified proteins were used, poly(dI-dC) was excluded from the binding reactions. All enzymes used for cloning were purchased from New England Biolabs. The pets site oligonucleotide used for EMSA is flanked by BamHI and BglII ends. A BglII restriction site was inserted into Puc 18 immediately 3′ to the BamHI cutting site. The 1x-pets oligonucleotide was inserted into this plasmid at the BamHI-BglII sites so that restriction with BamHI and BglII yielded a fragment 36 base pairs long. This 1x clone was cut with XmnI and BamHI or XmnI and BglII and fragments were gel purified before being ligated to make a 2x-pets clone. This procedure was repeated to obtain clones as large as a 32x-pets construct. All clones were verified by DNA sequencing. To generate a 32P-labeled probe for Southwestern hybridization, polymerase chain reaction primers flanking the multimeric insert were synthesized and used to amplify from a linearized 8x-pets construct using standard polymerase chain reaction procedures but with the inclusion of 5 µl of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham, 6000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed after polymerase chain reaction, using Ultrafree-MC filter units (Millipore). Bovine spleen nuclear extracts were found to have a high level of specific binding activity for the HIV-2 pets site, 2G. K. Fu and D. M. Markovitz, unpublished observations. and was chosen as a starting material for purification because of the large quantity that was readily available. To estimate the native molecular mass of the pets factor, purified pets factor (see below) was applied to a glycerol gradient and protein complexes were separated on the basis of their sedimentation coefficients using ultracentrifugation. Individual fractions were collected and assayed for sequence-specific DNA binding activity using EMSA. In our glycerol gradient sedimentation experiments, we have included four internal standards in each tube: alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and lysozyme (17 kDa). The location of these standards in the glycerol gradient fractions was determined by SDS-PAGE of 10 µl of each fraction followed by silver staining. The fraction that contained the peak DNA binding activity was also the fraction with the peak ovalbumin concentration (Fig. 2, lane 14). As determination of molecular mass by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation may be misleading due to aggregation of the protein of interest with itself or co-purified proteins, we used crude spleen extracts in UV cross-linking studies to find out the molecular mass of the pets factor under conditions where all nuclear proteins are present. Proteins which are capable of close contact with the bromouridine pets probe were cross-linked to the 32P-labeled probe with UV irradiation. The protein-DNA complexes were then separated by SDS-PAGE to estimate the molecular mass of the protein-DNA complex. Since many nuclear proteins in the crude extract will exhibit nonspecific affinity for the labeled DNA, we improved the specificity of this often used technique by including poly(dI-dC) at 1 µg/reaction and oligonucleotide competitors as indicated in Fig. 3. As expected, crude Jurkat nuclear extracts contain numerous proteins that cross-link to the pets probe (lane 3). Inclusion of 500 M excess of an unlabeled pets oligonucleotide competed out two bands: one indicated by the arrow in Fig. 3, and the other at 70 kDa (lane 4). However, inclusion of a 500 M excess of an oligonucleotide with an unrelated mutant HIV-2 κB (lane 6) or wild-type HIV-2 κB (lane 7) oligonucleotide did not compete away the two bands. The mutant pets oligonucleotide, in which only three nucleotides have been changed from the wild-type sequence, only weakly competed with the pets probe for binding (lane 5). In lane 8, purified bovine pets factor (after one round of DNA affinity chromatography) was used in the cross-linking reaction and a more highly purified fraction (after two rounds of DNA affinity chromatography) of bovine pets factor was used in lane 9. The cross-linking bands created by the purified pets factor appear to be identical in mobility to the two bands that competed out specifically in the experiments using crude extracts. As the effect of the cross-linked pets probe on protein migration in an SDS-PAGE was not known, we exploited the affinity for DNA of two commercially available enzymes to estimate this effect. DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment, New England Biolabs) and T4 DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) were cross-linked to the pets site probe (lanes 1 and 2). From these two DNA-binding proteins, the effect of a cross-linked pets probe on protein mobility in SDS-PAGE was estimated to be an addition of about 10 kDa to the proteins apparent molecular mass, assuming that the dynamics of DNA-protein cross-linking did not vary considerably. From these estimates, the dominant band from the purified protein represents a protein of about 43 kDa. A lighter band at 70 kDa capable of specific binding was observed in the experiments using crude spleen nuclear extracts. This band was also seen in lanes using highly purified pets factor (Fig. 3, lanes 8 and 9). As Southwestern blotting experiments using purified pets factor (Fig. 6C) did not show any additional bands other than the 43-kDa protein, this suggests that either some other protein may be cross-linked to the pets probe through its affinity for the 43-kDa protein or that two or more proteins that do not bind to the pets site by themselves dimerize to bind to the pets site. The improvements we made to the commonly used UV cross-linking assay gives this technique the additional ability to test the sequence specificity of proteins binding to DNA, as well as a means to estimate the effect of a particular DNA probe in mobility of protein-DNA complexes through SDS-PAGE. The pets factor was purified from bovine spleen using a five-step purification scheme (Fig. 4). Initial studies done with EMSA using nuclear extracts from mice and bovine heart, lung, thymus, and brain tissues indicated that a high pets-site specific binding activity was detected in spleen extracts (not shown). We therefore obtained spleens from freshly slaughtered cows and processed them as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column was chosen as the first chromatography step because of its high binding capacity and high flow rates. For each chromatography procedure used, a KCl salt gradient was used to elute the bound proteins from the column. Two µl from each fraction was used in EMSA to test for the presence of the pets factor. Two rounds of DNA-affinity chromatography purified the pets factor more than 3000-fold over crude extract with an overall yield of 4.7% (Table I). Using approximately 6000 times less protein than that used with crude Jurkat nuclear extracts, the purified pets extracts bound to the HIV-2 pets site in DNase I footprinting assays (Fig. 5, lane A). Of note, the pets footprint using either crude or purified extract extended somewhat more 5′ than in our previous experiments (Fig. 1 and Ref. 8Markovitz D.M. Smith M. Hilfinger J. Hannibal M.C. Petryniak B. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5479-5484Google Scholar). The 3′ extension of the footprint obtained with the crude Jurkat extract (lane J) corresponds to the PuB2 site, which our previous work has shown binds Elf-1 (7Leiden J.M. Wang C-Y. Petryniak B.

Silver staining of the highly purified extract shows only one dark staining band at 43 kDa (Fig. 7A, lanes 3-6), although other much lighter staining bands were also detected.Table I.The amount of protein remaining after each purification step is tabulatedPurification stepTotal proteinaDetermined using protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard.Total activitybDetermined by cpm counting of shifted complex on EMSA gel.Specific activityPurificationYieldmgcpmcpm/mgfold%Nuclear extractcRepresents the fraction that is loaded onto the Q-Sepharose column.212452 × 1060.21 × 1061100Q-Sepharose anion-exchange136142 × 1061.04 × 1064.9157Heparin-agarose affinity16.830.8 × 1061.8 × 1068.4534DNA-affinitydRepresents two successive rounds over a DNA affinity column.0.003eEstimated from Coomassie staining intensity relative to bovine serum albumin standards.215 × 106716.6 × 10633644.7a Determined using protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard.b Determined by cpm counting of shifted complex on EMSA gel.c Represents the fraction that is loaded onto the Q-Sepharose column.d Represents two successive rounds over a DNA affinity column.e Estimated from Coomassie staining intensity relative to bovine serum albumin standards.

https://openalex.org/W2090416622,"We have purified a novel factor (PAP-III) that is a component of a multisubunit poly(A) polymerase from pea seedlings. This factor consists of one or more polypeptides with molecular masses of about 105 kDa and of a population of associated RNAs that can serve as substrates for polyadenylation. When these RNAs are separated from the 105-kDa polypeptides, polyadenylation becomes dependent upon exogenously added RNA. This RNA-dependent activity does not require the presence of a polyadenylation signal in the substrate, indicating that the activity under study is a nonspecific polyadenylation activity. One or more of the 105-kDa polypeptides could be cross-linked to the products of polyadenylation labeled with [α-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP and to exogenously added labeled RNAs. Cross-linking of the 105-kDa polypeptides to the products of polyadenylation was not affected by the presence of exogenously added competitors, whereas cross-linking to exogenous RNAs was diminished by excesses of RNA homopolymers. Exogenous RNAs could be polyadenylated by the combination of PAP-I + PAP-III, and this activity was diminished if the binding of the exogenous RNAs to PAP-III was prevented. We conclude from these studies that PAP-III is an RNA binding protein, that polyadenylation by the poly(A) polymerase occurs while the substrate RNAs are associated with this protein, and that the pea poly(A) polymerase can only polyadenylate those RNAs that are associated with PAP-III."
https://openalex.org/W1977848475,"Apoproteins of several flavoproteins were reconstituted with 2′-F-2′-deoxyarabinoflavins and studied by 19F NMR and absorption spectroscopy. Extensive protein-fluorine interactions were observed by large chemical shift changes on binding to the apoprotein of Old Yellow Enzyme (apoOYE) and apoflavodoxin, whereas binding to apoglucose oxidase and apo D-amino acid oxidase (apoDAAO) resulted in minimal interactions. Modification at the flavin 2′-position in OYE resulted in a substantial decrease in the binding affinity of the flavin, possibly from the disruption of two important hydrogen bonds to Pro-35 and Arg-243. 19F NMR studies of complexes of OYE with testosterone, cyclohexenone, and β-estradiol suggest that phenols and α,β-unsaturated ketones orient differently at the active site on binding. The two separate one-electron potentials for the EFlox/EFlsq and EFlsq/EFlred couples were different for the reconstituted OYE. With native enzyme, there is 15-20% thermodynamic stabilization of the anionic flavin semiquinone, while no detectable amount of semiquinone was observed with modified OYE. This change in potential was further substantiated by blue shifts for the maxima of the modified protein-phenol charge transfer complexes. In accordance with the crystal structure of the OYE-p-OH-benzaldehyde complex (Fox, K.M. & Karplus, P.A. (1994) Structure 2, 1089-1105), 19F NMR studies with the modified OYE-2,4-F2-phenol suggest strong interaction between the para-fluorine of the phenol and Tyr-375. Apoproteins of several flavoproteins were reconstituted with 2′-F-2′-deoxyarabinoflavins and studied by 19F NMR and absorption spectroscopy. Extensive protein-fluorine interactions were observed by large chemical shift changes on binding to the apoprotein of Old Yellow Enzyme (apoOYE) and apoflavodoxin, whereas binding to apoglucose oxidase and apo D-amino acid oxidase (apoDAAO) resulted in minimal interactions.

INTRODUCTIONIn order to understand the various mechanisms of flavin reactions, knowledge of the protein environment at the active centers of different flavoenzymes is necessary. Several physical and chemical methods are available for this purpose. Of these, replacement of the native flavin with appropriately modified flavins and high resolution NMR techniques constitute very effective and widely exploited tools. The former method in general provides information about the solvent accessibility of the modified position, hydrophobicity, and steric constraints of the binding site (1Ghisla S. Massey V. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In the latter technique, comparison of the chemical shifts of the protein-bound flavin with the free flavin as well as the oxidized and reduced flavoproteins provides direct information about alterations in the magnetic environment of the substituent fluorine and hence can provide information about the protein environment surrounding the flavin (2Beinert W.

Old Yellow Enzyme is the oldest of the flavoprotein family and, as isolated from brewer's bottom yeast, is a mixture of homodimers and a heterodimer arising from two separate yeast genes, with each monomeric unit containing one FMN (5Schopfer L.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the fact that the physiological role of this enzyme is yet to be determined, the structure and reactivity of this protein has been the subject of extensive studies in our laboratory. Recent x-ray crystallographic studies suggest an important role for the 2′-hydroxyl group of the FMN in binding to the apoprotein and also in forming the binding site for various ligands (7Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1993. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1994: 381Crossref Google Scholar, 8Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This hydroxyl group is involved in two important hydrogen bonds with Pro-35 and with Arg-243, one of the positively charged residues around the flavin N1 (Fig. 1). It was thought that the disruption of these hydrogen bonds would affect the configuration of the net charge at the binding site and so it was of obvious interest to study how this would affect the flavin binding to apoprotein, binding of various ligands, and catalytic activity. A new flavin, 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxyarabinoriboflavin was designed, where the 2′-hydroxyl group of the ribityl side chain was replaced with a hydrogen and a fluorine was incorporated in place of the hydrogen at the same 2′-carbon (9Murthy Y.V.S.N. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28586-28594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 10Miller S.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13066-13073Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This flavin should be an ideal probe for ligand-binding studies and also provide information on the chemical environment of the flavin binding site in terms of 19F chemical shifts. It was also thought that this flavin could be a good 19F NMR probe for flavoproteins in general. The high sensitivity of 19F, which is next only to 1H, the wide range of chemical shifts, and the ease with which one can incorporate fluorine into biological molecules make 19F NMR a very effective physical tool to study proteins (11Sykes B.D. Hull W.E. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 49: 270-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Greig J.P. Berliner L.J. Rueben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. Plenum, New York1978: 139Google Scholar, 13Sykes B.D. Weiner J.H. Cohen J.S. Magnetic Resonance in Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1980: 171Google Scholar). Another important feature is that the number of peaks for each fluorine correspond to the number of binding environments present in the protein. Since the fluorine is in the ribityl side chain of this flavin, the net electron environment (fluorine is highly electronegative) of the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin is unperturbed by its presence, unlike in the case of 8-F-flavins, where the benzene ring of the flavin experiences more positive character due to the presence of the electronegative fluorine (4Macheroux P. Kojiro C.L. Schopfer L.M. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2670-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Another advantage of fluorine being on the hydrophilic ribityl side chain is that it interacts more with the protein; and changes in the fluorine chemical shifts are expected to be very sensitive to capture even minute changes in the protein conformation. In the case of 8-F-flavin, fluorine being on the hydrophobic benzene ring of the flavin, the differences in chemical shifts are not that pronounced for most of the proteins studied (4Macheroux P. Kojiro C.L. Schopfer L.M. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2670-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).

DNA is a flexible and dynamic molecule which can adopt a variety of conformations (1Sinden R.R. DNA Structure and Function. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar). Under certain conditions, some DNA sequences can change from the most prevalent right-handed B-DNA conformation and adopt unusual DNA conformations, such as left-handed Z-DNA (2Wang A.H.-J.

The results showed that d(CG)4-7 sequences are in a dynamic equilibrium between B- and Z-DNA forms, while longer alternating d(CG) sequences are predominantly in the Z-form. DNA supercoiling was essential for Z-DNA formation and higher DNA supercoiling favored Z-DNA formation in shorter d(CG) repeat sequences. Surprisingly, salt concentrations as high as 4 M NaCl did not promote Z-DNA formation in these shorter alternating d(CG) sequences to a measurable extent. Naturally occurring alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences adopting Z-DNA conformation have been found previously in many organisms including prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms, and plants and mammalian cells (2Wang A.H.-J.

Other functions for Z-DNA, such as a structural role in nucleosome formation (21Garner M.M. Felsenfeld G. J. Mol.

However, due to the dynamic nature of genetic processes and the transient nature of left-handed Z-DNA conformation, the exact roles of Z-DNA in vivo are still controversial. To gain deeper insight into the functional role of Z-DNA conformation in vivo, we explored the characteristics of a diversity of organisms and identified H. halobium as an interesting organism for the analysis of left-handed DNA conformation. H. halobium occupies an unusual evolutionary and physiological position, as a member of a group of obligately halophilic archaea (archaebacteria) requiring at least 3 M NaCl for growth. H. halobium contains high (>4 M) salt concentration (26Christian J.H.B. Waltho J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 65: 506-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), high (σ = 0.7) negative DNA supercoiling (10Kim J.- Yang C.-F. DasSarma S. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1969; 99: 248-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), all of which are known to favor Z-DNA conformation. We reasoned that Z-DNA is likely to be highly prevalent in the H. halobium genome, and isolation and characterization of these sequences may provide valuable information about the function of Z-DNA sequences generally. In order to isolate Z-DNA-forming regions of the H. halobium genome, we developed an improved method for affinity chromatography using a Z-DNA-specific monoclonal antibody column (29Thomae R. Beck S. Pohl F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5550-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Hoheisel J.D. Pohl F.M. J. Mol.

Using a plasmid series containing d(CG)n sequences, the procedure was shown to be highly selective and was used to isolate recombinant plasmids with Z-DNA-forming sequences from an H. halobium genomic library. We found that although salt has no measurable effect on Z-DNA formation in short alternating d(CG) sequences (10Kim J.- Yang C.-F. DasSarma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9340-9346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a large number of Z-DNA-forming sequences do exist in the H. halobium genome.

Standard methods of molecular biology including preparation of plasmids by the alkaline-SDS procedure, agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, CaCl2-mediated transformation of E. coli, labeling of DNA, etc. were carried out as described (33Sambrook J. Fristch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) on double-stranded plasmid template using the Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit. Southern and dot-blot hybridizations were carried out under stringent conditions as described (33Sambrook J. Fristch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3546-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and isolated by affinity chromatography using protein A-agarose. Protein A affinity chromatography was prepared by packing 0.4 ml of protein A-agarose in a chromatography column. The column was equilibrated with 10 bed volumes of binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.75) and 0.1 M NaCl) before application of DNA. For control experiments, 10-µg mixtures of pUC12 and pJKCGn (n = 2, 4, and 5) (constructions described in Ref. 10Kim J.- Yang C.-F. DasSarma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9340-9346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were incubated with 0.1 µg of Z22 antibodies in 100 µl of binding buffer at 37°C for 1 h. The mixture was passed through a protein A-agarose column prepared as above at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of binding buffer to remove nonspecifically bound DNA. The bound DNA was consecutively eluted with 2 column volumes of binding buffer with increasing ethidium bromide concentration (0.01, 0.5, 5, and 50 µg/ml). Each fraction of column volume was extracted twice with phenol and once with chloroform. The DNA was precipitated with 0.1 µg of yeast tRNA carrier, 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2), and 2 volumes of ethanol. DNA was collected by centrifugation, dried, and then transformed into E. coli DH5α. Transformants were plated on LB plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 40 µg/ml X-gal and incubated at 37°C overnight. For selection of Z-DNA-containing plasmids, an H. halobium genomic library, constructed by inserting partial Sau3AI fragments into the BamHI site of pUC12, was amplified (35DasSarma S. Damerval Y. Jones J.G. Tandeau de Marsac N. Mol. Microbiol. 1987; 1: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The affinity chromatography procedure was carried out as above using 10 µg of library DNA instead of the mixture of pUC12 and pJKCGn plasmids. The column fraction corresponding to the one which showed the most enriched pJKCGn plasmid in the control experiment, was collected, and the DNA was ethanol-precipitated as described above. The DNA was transformed into E. coli DH5α for plasmid amplification. The selected plasmid population was subjected to three additional rounds of affinity selection and amplification using the same procedure. Z-DNA conformation in pJKCGn and affinity-selected plasmids were first examined by the ZIBS 1The abbreviations used are: ZIBSZ-DNA-immuno-bandshiftX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactosidebpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s). (Z-DNA-immuno-bandshift) assay using Z22 monoclonal antibody cross-linking as described (10Kim J.- Yang C.-F. DasSarma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9340-9346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Fine mapping of Z-DNA conformation on pJKZ22 was carried out either by S1 nuclease and chemical modification assay (8Johnston B.H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 127-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Kim J.- Yang C.-F. DasSarma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9340-9346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or by a Z-DNA antibody footprinting assay (10Kim J.- Yang C.-F. DasSarma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9340-9346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For antibody footprinting assay, plasmid DNA was cross-linked with Z22 antibody and the DNA-antibody complex was incubated in 10 µl of reaction buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 5 units of PvuII. After 3 h of incubation at 37°C, 10 µl of the above buffer containing 0.5 units of exonuclease III was added to the reaction mixture and further incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was passed through a Sephadex G-10 spin column (33Sambrook J. Fristch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and dried under vacuum. The DNA was dissolved in 16 µl of water and denatured by the addition of 4 µl of 2 N NaOH. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, the DNA was precipitated by addition of 20 µl of 0.9 M sodium acetate and 120 µl of ethanol. The DNA was collected by centrifugation and then dissolved in 5 µl of water and then phosphorylated by addition of 5 µl of 2 × kination buffer containing 2.5 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP and 2 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase. The reaction mixture was subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Z-DNA-immuno-bandshift 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside base pair(s) kilobase pair(s). For S1 nuclease assays, 1 µg of plasmid DNAs were incubated with 0.1 unit of S1 nuclease at 37°C for 10 min in 20 µl of 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM zinc acetate. The reaction mixtures were extracted twice with phenol and once with chloroform, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol as above. The site of cleavage was mapped by primer extension using 32P-labeled forward or reverse sequencing primers and Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gels (10Kim J.- Yang C.-F. DasSarma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9340-9346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For OsO4 modification assays, plasmid DNAs were incubated in a 50-µl solution containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 M NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM OsO4, and 2 mM bipyrimidine at 37°C for 10 min. The reaction mixtures were passed through a Sephadex G-50 spin column, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol. OsO4-sensitive sites were mapped by primer extension analysis as described above. In order to isolate naturally occurring DNA sequences adopting Z-DNA conformation, a highly selective affinity chromatography method was developed. The method involved incubation of plasmid DNA with Z22 monoclonal antibody specific for Z-DNA, followed by chromatography through a protein A-agarose column. The Z-DNA-containing plasmids that were complexed to antibody were retained on the column via protein A-antibody bridges, whereas other plasmids lacking Z-DNA were eluted. Bound plasmids were eluted by increasing concentrations of ethidium bromide, which unwinds the DNA by intercalation and converts Z-DNA segments into B-DNA conformation. This led to loss of antibody binding and elution of Z-positive plasmids from the column. To determine the efficiency of the affinity chromatography to select Z-positive plasmids, control experiments using mixtures of pUC12 and pJKCGn (n = 2, 4, and 5, where n refers to the number of CG dinucleotide repeats) were carried out. Plasmid DNA mixtures were incubated with Z22 antibodies and passed through the protein A-agarose column. The column was washed with excess binding buffer to remove nonspecifically bound DNA. The bound DNA in the column was eluted using increasing concentrations of ethidium bromide. Fractions were collected, and the DNA was purified by extraction with phenol and chloroform and by ethanol precipitation. The purified DNA was used to transform E. coli DH5α, and transformants were plated on LB plates containing ampicillin and X-gal. The quantity of plasmid DNA in each fraction was determined by counting the total number of transformants. Transformants containing pUC12 produced blue colonies on plates with X-gal, whereas transformants containing pJKCG2, pJKCG4, and pJKCG5 plasmids produced white colonies, due to frameshifts in the LacZα coding region caused by the d(CG)n inserts. Therefore, enrichment by affinity purification could be easily determined by counting the number of blue and white colonies. Fig. 1 shows the plasmid elution profile using the buffer containing ethidium bromide. Not shown is that more than 90% of plasmids applied to the column were either not bound or washed off the column by buffer lacking ethidium bromide. Plasmids were quantitatively released with 0.5 µg/ml and 5 µg/ml ethidium bromide with the highest enrichment of Z-positive plasmids observed at the higher concentration. Better enrichment was observed for pJKCG5 than for pJKCG4, as would be expected from our earlier finding that the insert in 90% of the former and 20% of the latter are in the Z-form (10Kim J.- Yang C.-F. DasSarma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9340-9346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Using 10:1 mixtures of pUC12:pJKCG4 or pJKCG5, about 10-fold enrichment of pJKCG4 and 1,000-fold enrichment of pJKCG5 were observed in the peak fractions. A maximum of 4,000-fold enrichment was demonstrated using a 100:1 mixture of pUC12 and pJKCG5 (data not shown). After determining the high selectivity of our affinity chromatography procedure in control experiments using mixtures of pUC12 and pJKCGn plasmids, we used plasmid DNA amplified from an H. halobium genomic library to isolate natural sequences capable of adopting Z-DNA conformation. The genomic library had previously been constructed by inserting partial Sau3AI fragments into the BamHI site of pUC12 (35DasSarma S. Damerval Y. Jones J.G. Tandeau de Marsac N. Mol. Microbiol. 1987; 1: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The genomic plasmid library was incubated with Z22 antibody, and the mixture was passed over a protein A-agarose column. After washing the column with an excess amount of binding buffer, Z-DNA-antibody complex bound to protein A-agarose was eluted with buffer containing ethidium bromide. The fractions corresponding to the most enriched fractions were collected and transformed into E. coli DH5α for amplification. Plasmid DNA was isolated from a culture of the total mixture of transformed cells. The plasmid population enriched for Z-positive plasmids was subjected to a second, third, and fourth cycle of Z-DNA selection by affinity chromatography to obtain plasmid mixtures increasingly enriched for Z-DNA. Plasmids isolated from each cycle of Z-DNA selection procedure were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis to determine if specific plasmids were selected from the genomic library (Fig. 2). Library DNA before selection for Z-positive plasmids was highly complex and appeared as a smear upon electrophoresis (lane 2), whereas distinct bands appeared after successive passages through the affinity column (lanes 3-6). This confirmed that the procedure is selective for Z-DNA-containing plasmids with greater purity in successive cycles of chromatography. After four cycles of Z-DNA enrichment and amplification, plasmids were prepared in large scale and electrophoresed on a preparative agarose gel. After staining the gel with ethidium bromide, 20 distinct bands were observed. Each was purified by electroelution and transformed into E. coli DH5α for DNA amplification. Plasmid DNAs obtained from gel purified Z-positive bands were designated as pJKZn, where n refers to the identity of individual plasmids. Some bands yielded multiple Z-positive plasmids. The presence and approximate location of Z-DNA conformation in the isolated pJKZn plasmids was analyzed by ZIBS assay (10Kim J.- Yang C.-F. DasSarma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9340-9346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For the ZIBS assay, plasmid DNAs were incubated with and cross-linked to Z22 antibody, digested with HinfI, and labeled with [α-32P]dATP by Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. The bands containing the Z-DNA segment were shifted-up due to antibody cross-linking and the band intensity decrease was used as the criterion for Z-DNA formation. Each isolated plasmid was subjected to the ZIBS assay and the results for several, pJKZ73, 81, 162, 173, 182, 183, 191, 192, and 201, are shown in Fig. 3. The intensity of one HinfI restriction fragment in each plasmid decreased upon antibody cross-linking (even-numbered lanes) compared to the same fragment intensity without antibody cross-linking (odd-numbered lanes). The occurrence of antibody binding reflected by a clearly shifted band was detected in 20 distinct recombinant plasmids, although some differences in the extent of bandshift probably reflecting the strength of antibody binding was observed.

Open table in a new tab Further analysis of Z-DNA conformation in recombinant plasmids isolated by affinity chromatography was carried out by digestion with BssHII. Since BssHII recognizes the sequence G′CGCGC, the occurrence of short (dG-dC) repeats, the most likely Z-DNA-forming sequence, could be tested. The results of restriction digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis (data not shown, Ref. 36Kim, J.-M., 1995, Left-handed Z-DNA in Halobacterium halobium. Ph.D. thesis, University of Massachusetts, Amherst.Google Scholar) indicate that all isolated plasmids were cleaved by BssHII. Since there is no BssHII recognition sequence in the pUC12 vector portion, cleavage by BssHII indicates that all inserts contain at least one (dG-dC)3 repeat sequence (Table I). Several plasmids, such as pJKZ32, pJKZ51, and pJKZ63, contained many BssHII cleavage sites. These results indicate that the Z-positive plasmids may contain multiple Z-DNA-forming (dG-dC) repeat sequences. Since d(CG) repeats have high potential to form Z-DNA, it was of interest to analyze whether BssHII recognition sites indeed correlate to Z22 antibody binding and Z-DNA formation. For all plasmids tested, antibody-binding HinfI restriction fragments were cleaved by BssHII (data not shown, Ref. 36Kim, J.-M., 1995, Left-handed Z-DNA in Halobacterium halobium. Ph.D. thesis, University of Massachusetts, Amherst.Google Scholar). These results suggested that the Z-DNA-forming sequences isolated may contain alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences with at least one (dG-dC)3 repeat. In order to obtain more information about DNA sequences adopting Z-DNA conformation, limited DNA sequence analysis of several pJKZn plasmids was carried"
https://openalex.org/W2032353111,"Preferential binding to single- or double-stranded nucleic acids is important for the activity of many proteins that process RNA and DNA. We have investigated the mechanism of strandedness discrimination with peptides derived from the putative DNA-binding domain of the RecA protein, a bacterial recombinase that modulates its affinity for single-stranded DNA by means of ATP binding and hydrolysis. Contributions of electrostatic and non-electrostatic interactions to binding of these peptides with polynucleotides were evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy as a function of salt concentration and peptide charge. Binding of these peptides to single- and double-stranded nucleic acids was dominated by non-electrostatic interactions. Small electrostatic contributions selectively enhanced peptide complexation with single-stranded nucleic acids. Similar results were observed in control experiments carried out with tripeptides containing charged and aromatic amino acid residues. It was possible to modify the strandedness preference of peptide-polynucleotide complexes by changing electrostatic contributions to the binding free energy.

Preferential binding to single- or double-stranded polynucleotides is characteristic of numerous proteins involved in DNA replication, transcription, DNA repair, and homologous recombination (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2d Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar).

These proteins generally bind to nucleic acids cooperatively or as multimeric complexes. It is important to understand how these proteins recognize single- and double-stranded polynucleotides and how they change strandedness preference.

Hence, a peptide corresponding to the L2 loop may reproduce some of the DNA binding behavior of the L2 sequence in the protein and is an attractive model polynucleotide-binding domain to study strandedness specificity. We have investigated two peptides with the essential features of the L2 loop (Fig. 1b). In peptide wtw, the wild-type sequence was modified (F203W) in order to follow binding by fluorescence spectroscopy. Peptide 659w has a further modification (E207Q), which increases the net charge. KWK and AcKWK were included as control peptides with the same net charge as the L2 peptides, but with different amino acid sequences. We measured the binding of these peptides to the single-stranded polynucleotides poly(U), poly(A), and poly(dA) and to double-stranded DNA and poly(A)·poly(U) at low salt concentrations. Electrostatic and non-electrostatic contributions to the stability of the resulting complexes were evaluated from the effect of peptide charge on binding and from the stability of the peptide-polynucleotide complexes in the presence of high salt concentrations. Peptides wtw, 659w, KWK, and AcKWK (Fig. 1b) were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems Model 430A apparatus by standard t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry and purified by reversed-phase HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyDNPdinitrophenol. on an Aquapore C8 column with a 0-70% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide purity was evaluated by HPLC, and molecular weights were confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy. Peptide stock concentrations were determined from Trp absorption at 280 nm in water at 25°C after confirming that absorption of the peptides in water was the same as in 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride (17Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). Trp and polynucleotides were purchased from Sigma. Polynucleotides were exhaustively dialyzed against reaction buffer, and their concentrations were determined in 0.1 M Tris acetate, pH 7.4, at 25°C from published extinction coefficients (18Rajeswari M.R. Montenay-Garestier T. Hélène C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6825-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Mascotti D.P. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8932-8946Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Solutions were prepared with filtered deionized water (Milli-Q, Millipore Corp.). Titrations were carried out in low salt buffer (10 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4) or high salt buffer (1 M KCH3CO2, 10 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4, for DNA, poly(A)·poly(U), and poly(U); 0.2 M KCH3CO2, 10 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4, for poly(A) and poly(dA)).

Fluorescence spectra were measured with an SLM 500 spectrofluorometer (AMINCO). Samples were excited at 292 nm, and fluorescence was recorded as the integrated emission at 335-500 nm. Bandwidths for excitation and emission were 2 nm. UV absorbance and fluorescence of the peptide solutions varied linearly with peptide concentration, indicating the absence of association between peptide molecules in the concentration ranges used. During titration, aliquots of polynucleotide stock solution were added to peptide solutions. The samples were agitated and allowed to equilibrate in a thermostated sample holder at 25°C. In some experiments, titrations were carried out in low salt buffer, and the electrostatic contributions to the resulting complex were subsequently investigated by titrating with 2 M KCH3CO2 (or NaCH3CO2), 10 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4. In other experiments, non-electrostatic binding was measured by titrating the peptide with polynucleotide in high salt buffer. Data are reported as fluorescence quenching, Qobs = (F0− F)/F0, where F0 is the initial fluorescence in the absence of polynucleotide and F is the fluorescence during titration. Fluorescence intensity was corrected for dilution, and inner filter effects were corrected by the relation (20Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Crossref Google Scholar) Fcorr = Fobs antilog(Aex/2), where Fcorr and Fobs are the corrected and observed fluorescence, respectively, and Aex is the absorbance at the excitation wavelength (292 nm), which was calculated from the concentrations of polynucleotide and peptide with the following extinction coefficients: ϵ292 = 104 M−1 cm−1 (poly(A) and poly(dA)), ϵ292 = 160 M−1 cm−1 (poly(U)), ϵ292 = 850 M−1 cm−1 (DNA), ϵ292 = 183 M−1 cm−1 (poly(A)·poly(U)), and ϵ292 = 3200 M−1 cm−1 (peptides). Measurements during titration showed that the absorbance of polynucleotides in the reaction mixture obeyed Beer's law at 292 nm over the entire concentration range of the experiments. Experiments were carried in a 0.4 × 1.0-cm quartz cuvette with the 0.4-cm path oriented in the direction of the excitation beam in order to minimize absorbance corrections. Dividing the calculated absorbance by 2 did not significantly alter the shape of the fluorescence titration curves, and the relative magnitudes of the binding constants in Table I were unchanged, indicating that our qualitative conclusions are independent of uncertainties in inner filter correction.TABLE I.Binding constants for the reaction of peptides with single- and double-stranded polynucleotides in solution at 25°C, pH 7.4 Complexes are grouped by polynucleotide.Complexlog(Kobs)a10 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4.log(Kobsnel)b10 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 1 M KCH3CO2 (DNA, poly(A)·poly(U), and poly(U)) or 10 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 0.2 M KCH3CO2 (poly(A) and poly(dA)).log(Kobsel)clog(Kobs) − log(Kobsnel).Poly(A)·poly(U)wtw3.20 ± 0.083.22 ± 0.05−0.02 ± 0.13659w3.13 ± 0.073.12 ± 0.070.05 ± 0.14KWK3.09 ± 0.043.03 ± 0.040.05 ± 0.08DNAwtw3.86 ± 0.043.85 ± 0.050.01 ± 0.09659w4.06 ± 0.083.87 ± 0.060.19 ± 0.14Poly(A)wtw2.80 ± 0.082.72 ± 0.060.07 ± 0.14659w3.20 ± 0.092.70 ± 0.070.49 ± 0.16KWK3.12 ± 0.062.60 ± 0.050.51 ± 0.11Poly(dA)wtw2.70 ± 0.042.68 ± 0.050.02 ± 0.09659w2.63 ± 0.042.36 ± 0.050.27 ± 0.09Poly(U)wtw2.74 ± 0.102.58 ± 0.080.16 ± 0.18659w3.14 ± 0.072.59 ± 0.050.55 ± 0.12KWK3.13 ± 0.052.52 ± 0.050.61 ± 0.10a 10 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4.b 10 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 1 M KCH3CO2 (DNA, poly(A)·poly(U), and poly(U)) or 10 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 0.2 M KCH3CO2 (poly(A) and poly(dA)).c log(Kobs) − log(Kobsnel). Open table in a new tab The formalism of McGee and von Hippel (21Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H.

Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar) for noncooperative binding of ligand on an infinite lattice was used to determine apparent binding constants. Fluorescence quenching curves were calculated as a function of binding constant (Kobs; M−1), site size (n), and Qmax. Kobs is an apparent binding constant for the overall equilibrium, [peptide] + [polynucleotide] ⇆ [peptide-polynucleotide], which may include electrostatic and non-electrostatic interactions. Qmax is the quenching of peptide complexed to polynucleotide. We have fit the fluorescence quenching data assuming n = 3 or 15, the number of amino acid residues in the peptide. If data are available for sufficient peptide binding (>80% of maximum quenching), then both Qmax and Kobs can be determined from the best fit of the fluorescence data. Alternatively, Qmax can be determined independently of Kobs and n by analyzing titrations of several concentrations of peptide with the binding density function method (23Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 258-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Good agreement for Qmax was observed by these two methods where comparison was possible. In some cases (such as titration in high salt buffer), we were unable to add sufficient polynucleotides to unambiguously calculate Qmax from the titration curve or to perform binding density function analysis. We assumed in these experiments that Qmax was the same in low and high salt buffers. We found Qmax = 1 within experimental error for all reactions studied, except titration of peptide KWK with poly(U) at pH 5.8, where Qmax = 0.85 ± 0.05, in agreement with previously published results (19Mascotti D.P. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8932-8946Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Representative fits are shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4. We calculated the contributions of electrostatic interactions to binding (Kelobs) by Kelobs = Kobs/Knelobs, where Kobs is the binding constant in 10 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4, at 25°C, and Knelobs is the non-electrostatic contribution to binding estimated by the titration of peptides in high salt buffer.Fig. 3Fluorescence quenching of 24 µM peptide with poly(A)·poly(U) (a) and 18 µM peptide with DNA (c) and fluorescence quenching of complexes formed in a and c upon addition of KCH3CO2 (b and d, respectively).

Both electrostatic and non-electrostatic interactions contributed to the binding of peptide 659w to single-stranded poly(A) and poly(U) at 25°C, pH 7.4; this can be seen by the partial decrease in quenching of the peptide-polynucleotide solution with increasing KCH3CO2 (Fig. 2, squares). Complexes between peptide wtw and single-stranded nucleic acids were less sensitive to salt (Fig. 2, circles), indicating that they were stabilized to a lesser extent by electrostatic interactions. Non-electrostatic interactions stabilized the complexation of both wtw and 659w with double-stranded poly(A)·poly(U) and DNA in these reaction conditions without significant contributions from electrostatic binding (Fig. 3). The non-electrostatic nature of this binding is apparent from the incapacity of KCH3CO2 to disrupt the peptide complexes with poly(A)·poly(U) or DNA (Fig. 3) and from the similar titration curves observed in low and high salt buffers (data not shown). Furthermore, the fluorescence curves observed upon titration of 659w or wtw with double-stranded nucleic acids in low salt solutions were insensitive to the different charges of the peptides, as would be expected for non-electrostatic binding. To quantitate electrostatic and non-electrostatic contributions to binding, we determined the relative contributions of Kelobs and Knelobs from titration curves measured at various salt concentrations (Table I). Electrostatic binding did not significantly contribute to the stability of any peptide complex with double-stranded poly(A)·poly(U) or DNA. Furthermore, binding of peptide wtw to single-stranded polynucleotides was also driven by non-electrostatic interactions. Electrostatic interactions contributed selectively to the stability of complexes between peptide 659 and single-stranded polynucleotides; the calculated electrostatic binding constants were 2 orders of magnitude less than the non-electrostatic binding constants. It has been previously reported that short peptides of polylysine containing Trp residues bind to polynucleotides primarily by electrostatic interactions (18Rajeswari M.R. Montenay-Garestier T. Hélène C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6825-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Mascotti D.P. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8932-8946Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Mascotti D.P. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10568-10579Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Brun F.

A. 1990; 87: 3142-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To investigate whether these differences with our observations were a consequence of particular peptide sequences or different reaction conditions, we compared the binding of KWK to poly(U) under our conditions at pH 7.4 with the same reaction at pH 5.8, which has been previously well studied (19Mascotti D.P. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8932-8946Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Binding constants (Table II) were determined from the fluorescence quenching of 6-16 µM KWK with poly(U) in 20 mM KCH3CO2, pH 5.8. Fluorescence quenching of the resulting complexes diminished upon addition of KCH3CO2, and the linear part of the plot of log(Kobs) versus log[K+] had a slope of −1.50 ± 0.22. The extrapolated binding constant at 1 M monovalent cation, log(Kobs) = 0.9 ± 0.4, is taken as a measure of the non-electrostatic contribution to binding (24Record T.M. Lohman T.M. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). These results agree with previous reports (19Mascotti D.P. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8932-8946Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that electrostatic interactions stabilize KWK-poly(U) complexes at low salt concentrations and pH 6. However, peptide KWK bound to poly(U) at this pH in the presence of 1 M KCH3CO2 (Table II). Furthermore, KWK bound to poly(U) in 10 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4, by non-electrostatic interactions at low salt concentrations judging from log(Kobs) extrapolated to [K+] = 1 M (Fig. 4 and Table II).TABLE II.Titration of peptide KWK with poly(U) at 25°CpH 5.8pH 7.4, low saltc10 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4.Low salta20 mM KCH3CO2, pH 5.8.High saltb1 M KCH3CO2, pH 5.8.log(Kobs)3.43 ± 0.042.65 ± .053.13 ± 0.05δlog(Kobs)/δlog([K+])−1.50 ± 0.22−0.60 ± 0.05log(Kobs), [K+] = 1 M0.90 ± 0.381.90 ± 0.08a 20 mM KCH3CO2, pH 5.8.b 1 M KCH3CO2, pH 5.8.c 10 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.4. Open table in a new tab At pH 5.8, the α-amino group of peptide KWK is protonated (pK = 7.5) (26Brun F. Toulmé J.J. Hélène C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Deprotonation or screening of the charge at the amine by 1 M salt might partially explain our observed non-electrostatic interactions. To investigate this possibility, we compared the binding of peptides KWK and AcKWK to poly(U) at pH 5.8 (Table III). Acetylation of the α-amine decreased the apparent binding constant in low salt solutions as expected from loss of +1 net positive charge. However, increasing salt concentrations only slightly diminished fluorescence quenching of the resulting complex. Hence, in contrast to peptide KWK, non-electrostatic interactions contributed to the stability of the AcKWK-poly(U) complex at low salt concentrations. The binding constants of AcKWK in low salt (Table III) and KWK in high salt (Table II) were identical, suggesting that AcKWK may be a good model for binding of KWK to poly(U) at high salt concentrations, pH 5.8. Finally, interactions between Trp and poly(U) probably account for non-electrostatic binding; the equilibrium constant for binding of tryptophan to poly(U) under these conditions closely resembled that for the tripeptide AcKWK (Table III). Taken together, these results suggest that the charge on the α-amine of peptide KWK influences the mechanism by which this molecule binds to poly(U). If this moiety was protonated, (pH 5.8), interactions with the polynucleotide in low salt solution were almost entirely electrostatic; if the charge of this moiety was neutralized by acetylation or pH or if it was screened by high salt concentrations, non-electrostatic interactions became important.TABLE III.Binding constants for the reaction of peptides with single-stranded poly(U) and double-stranded DNA at 25°C in 20 mM NaCH3CO2, pH 5.8Poly(U)DNAKWK3.43 ± 0.04aComplex destabilized by NaCH3CO2.3.59 ± 0.01bComplex stable in the presence of increasing NaCH3CO2 concentrations.AcKWK2.75 ± 0.04bComplex stable in the presence of increasing NaCH3CO2 concentrations.3.47 ± 0.02bComplex stable in the presence of increasing NaCH3CO2 concentrations.Trp2.59 ± 0.06bComplex stable in the presence of increasing NaCH3CO2 concentrations.NDcND, not determined.a Complex destabilized by NaCH3CO2.b Complex stable in the presence of increasing NaCH3CO2 concentrations.c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The influence of electrostatic contributions on the binding of KWK to single- and double-stranded polynucleotides (Fig. 4 and TABLE I., TABLE III.) resembled that observed for peptide 659w (Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Table I). In all cases, electrostatic interactions significantly stabilized complexes of both peptides with single-stranded polynucleotides and had little or no detectable contribution to the stability of complexes with double-stranded nucleic acids. The nucleic acid-binding domains of proteins that preferentially recognize single-stranded nucleic acids are believed to be characterized by positively charged amino acid residues that interact electrostatically with the polynucleotide phosphate backbone and aromatic amino acids that can stabilize the complex through non-electrostatic interactions (2Chase J.W. Williams K.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 103-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 3Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev.

We have evaluated electrostatic and non-electrostatic contributions to the complexation of peptides with single- and double-stranded polynucleotides. The peptides studied were derived from the L2 DNA-binding domain of the RecA protein, a bacterial recombinase that cycles, in an ATP-dependent reaction, between conformations with high and low affinity for single-stranded DNA. These were compared with model tripeptides (KWK and AcKWK) that have the same charge as the L2 peptides (Fig. 1). Two types of experiments showed that complexes of all peptides with double-stranded polynucleotides were stabilized by non-electrostatic interactions (Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and TABLE I., TABLE III.). First, fluorescence quenching of peptides by poly(A)·poly(U) and DNA was insensitive to salt concentration. Second, altering the charge of the peptide did not affect binding to double-stranded nucleic acids; peptide charge was modified by either an amino acid substitution in the case of the L2 peptides or acetylation of the α-amino group of peptide KWK. Complexes of peptides with single-stranded polynucleotides were stabilized mainly by non-electrostatic interactions. Recent filter binding studies have also shown that peptides based on the amino acid sequence of the L2 loop of the RecA protein bound to single-stranded DNA at high salt concentrations and neutral pH (28Gardner R.V. Voloshin O.N. Camerini-Otero R.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) presumably by non-electrostatic interactions. However, we observed that the stability of single-stranded complexes was also partially sensitive to the charge of the peptide and to salt concentration (Table I). Hence, in our experiments, non-electrostatic interactions stabilized peptide complexes with both single- and double-stranded polynucleotides; electrostatic interactions, on the other hand, contributed selectively to the stability of single-stranded complexes. Early fluorescence studies (26Brun F. Toulmé J.J. Hélène C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 29Toulmé J.-J. Charlier M. Hélène C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3185-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) reported that peptide KWK bound to single- and double-stranded polynucleotides at low salt concentrations primarily by electrostatic interactions. The observed preference of KWK for single-stranded polynucleotides (26Brun F. Toulmé J.J. Hélène C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 29Toulmé J.-J. Charlier M. Hélène C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3185-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) likely reflects the larger electrostatic contributions to the stability of these complexes, compared with double-stranded polynucleotides, and is consistent with our results. However, in those experiments, inner filter effects were evaluated from fluorescence quenching of the reactants in solutions with high salt concentrations where complexes were assumed to entirely dissociate. Correcting for inner filter effects by this procedure could subtract potential non-electrostatic interactions from titrations at low salt concentrations, which may in part explain the reported absence of non-electrostatic binding. Oligolysine peptides (K)n-ϵ-N-DNP-K (n = 3-8) (24Record T.M. Lohman T.M. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 30Latt S.A. Sober H.A. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 3293-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and KWKn (n = 1-8) (25Mascotti D.P. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10568-10579Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) have been shown to bind to polynucleotides by an entirely electrostatic process. We also observed that non-electrostatic contributions did not significantly stabilize complexes between single-stranded poly(U) and KWK at pH 5.8 in low salt solution (Table II) as previously reported (19Mascotti D.P. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8932-8946Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Mascotti D.P. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10568-10579Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, deprotonation or acetylation of the α-amine of KWK or high salt concentrations increased the non-electrostatic contribution to this reaction (Fig. 4 and Tables I, II, III). These observations suggest that in low salt solutions at pH 5.8, KWK binds to polynucleotides through the positively charged αamino group. Interactions between the α-amino group and the polynucleotide may explain why peptides with a total charge of z < +4 bind to single-stranded polynucleotides with different thermodynamics than more highly charged oligolysine molecules (25Mascotti D.P. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10568-10579Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results show that peptides with an uncharged α-amine extremity and a small net positive charge bind to polynucleotides in low salt solutions qualitatively differently than highly charged oligolysine molecules. Their large non-electrostatic interactions compared with those of polylysine oligopeptides suggest different peptide-nucleic acid contacts in the two cases. One important consequence of these results is that electrostatic contributions to the binding free energy can modulate the strandedness preference of peptide-nucleic acid complexes. For example, reducing the net positive charge of the peptide by an amino acid substitution (659w → wtw) had no effect on peptide binding to double-stranded poly(A)·poly(U) at pH 7.4, but decreased binding to the component single-stranded polynucleotides poly(A) and poly(U) (Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Table I). Likewise, neutralization of the positive charge of the α-amino group (KWK → AcKWK) had little effect on binding to double-stranded DNA at pH 5.8, but decreased binding to single-stranded poly(U) (Table III). Similarly, at pH 7.4, electrostatic interactions stabilized complexes of peptide KWK with poly(A) or poly(U) more than with double-stranded poly(A)·poly(U) (Fig. 4 and Table I). These results show that, at least for certain peptide-polynucleotide complexes, increasing electrostatic binding can selectively enhance the affinity of the peptide for single-stranded nucleic acids. It should be noted that this observation cannot be explained by the relative charge density of single-stranded nucleic acids, which is lower than that of duplex molecules (27Mascotti D.P. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3142-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We speculate that non-electrostatic interactions might constrain the peptide molecule and that weak electrostatic contacts might be favored by the greater conformational flexibility of single-stranded polynucleotides. If these results can be extrapolated to protein-nucleic acid complexes, then protein conformational changes that modify the net charge of the binding domain could regulate strandedness preference of the protein. We note, for example, that negatively as well as positively charged amino acids are present in homologous DNA-binding domains of recombinases from phage to man (Fig. 1a) (8Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Matsuda Y. Ushio N. Ikeo K. Ogawa T. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T.

Science. 1993; 259: 1892-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); negative charges in the DNA-binding domain might allow these proteins to modulate their affinity for single-stranded DNA by means of allosteric conformational changes that modify the relative electrostatic and non-electrostatic contributions to polynucleotide binding. Alteration of the relative affinity of the L2 loop of the RecA protein for single- and double-stranded DNA could have important consequences for the mechanism of action of the RecA-DNA nucleoprotein filament during homologous recombination. We are grateful to J. F. Tocanne, M. Defais, and P. H. von Hippel for helpful discussions and encouragement."
