https://openalex.org/W2148898943,"Primitive Origins for Microglia Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system and are associated with neurodegeneration and brain inflammatory diseases. Although the developmental origins of other tissue macrophage populations are well established, the origins of microglia remain controversial. Ginhoux et al. (p. 841 , published online 21 October) used in vivo lineage tracing studies to show that microglia arise early in mouse development and derive from primitive macrophages in the yolk sac. This is in contrast to other cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, which arise later in development from a distinct progenitor population."
https://openalex.org/W2015347941,"CD4(+) T-helper cells that selectively produce interleukin (IL)-17 (T(H)17), are critical for host defence and autoimmunity. Although crucial for T(H)17 cells in vivo, IL-23 has been thought to be incapable of driving initial differentiation. Rather, IL-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 have been proposed to be the factors responsible for initiating specification. Here we show that T(H)17 differentiation can occur in the absence of TGF-β signalling. Neither IL-6 nor IL-23 alone efficiently generated T(H)17 cells; however, these cytokines in combination with IL-1β effectively induced IL-17 production in naive precursors, independently of TGF-β. Epigenetic modification of the Il17a, Il17f and Rorc promoters proceeded without TGF-β1, allowing the generation of cells that co-expressed RORγt (encoded by Rorc) and T-bet. T-bet(+)RORγt(+) T(H)17 cells are generated in vivo during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, and adoptively transferred T(H)17 cells generated with IL-23 without TGF-β1 were pathogenic in this disease model. These data indicate an alternative mode for T(H)17 differentiation. Consistent with genetic data linking IL23R with autoimmunity, our findings re-emphasize the importance of IL-23 and therefore may have therapeutic implications."

https://openalex.org/W2087807155,"Watering the Moon About a year ago, a spent upper stage of an Atlas rocket was deliberately crashed into a crater at the south pole of the Moon, ejecting a plume of debris, dust, and vapor. The goal of this event, the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) experiment, was to search for water and other volatiles in the soil of one of the coldest places on the Moon: the permanently shadowed region within the Cabeus crater. Using ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectroscopy data from accompanying craft, Colaprete et al. (p. 463 ; see the news story by Kerr ; see the cover) found evidence for the presence of water and other volatiles within the ejecta cloud. Schultz et al. (p. 468 ) monitored the different stages of the impact and the resulting plume. Gladstone et al. (p. 472 ), using an ultraviolet spectrograph onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), detected H 2 , CO, Ca, Hg, and Mg in the impact plume, and Hayne et al. (p. 477 ) measured the thermal signature of the impact and discovered that it had heated a 30 to 200 square-meter region from ∼40 kelvin to at least 950 kelvin. Paige et al. (p. 479) mapped cryogenic zones predictive of volatile entrapment, and Mitrofanov et al. (p. 483 ) used LRO instruments to confirm that surface temperatures in the south polar region persist even in sunlight. In all, about 155 kilograms of water vapor was emitted during the impact; meanwhile, the LRO continues to orbit the Moon, sending back a stream of data to help us understand the evolution of its complex surface structures."

https://openalex.org/W1971013077,"Aneuploidy, referring here to genome contents characterized by abnormal numbers of chromosomes, has been associated with developmental defects, cancer and adaptive evolution in experimental organisms. However, it remains unresolved how aneuploidy impacts gene expression and whether aneuploidy could directly bring about phenotypic variation and improved fitness over that of euploid counterparts. Here we show, using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics and phenotypic profiling, that levels of protein expression in aneuploid yeast strains largely scale with chromosome copy numbers, following the same trend as that observed for the transcriptome, and that aneuploidy confers diverse phenotypes. We designed a novel scheme to generate, through random meiotic segregation, 38 stable and fully isogenic aneuploid yeast strains with distinct karyotypes and genome contents between 1N and 3N without involving any genetic selection. Through quantitative growth assays under various conditions or in the presence of a panel of chemotherapeutic or antifungal drugs, we found that some aneuploid strains grew significantly better than euploid control strains under conditions suboptimal for the latter. These results provide strong evidence that aneuploidy directly affects gene expression at both the transcriptome and proteome levels and can generate significant phenotypic variation that could bring about fitness gains under diverse conditions. Our findings suggest that the fitness ranking between euploid and aneuploid cells is dependent on context and karyotype, providing the basis for the notion that aneuploidy can directly underlie phenotypic evolution and cellular adaptation."

https://openalex.org/W2049088975,"The endoribonuclease Dicer is a key factor in the production of microRNAs. The deregulation of microRNA expression and potentially Dicer itself have been implicated in cancer. Elsa Flores and colleagues now show that TAp63, a member of the p53 family of tumour suppressors, suppresses tumorigenesis and metastasis by directly controlling the expression of Dicer and Dicer-regulated microRNAs. The aberrant expression of microRNAs and of the enzymes that control their processing has been reported in tumours, but the mechanisms involved are not clear. It is now shown that TAp63, a member of the p53 family of tumour suppressors, suppresses tumorigeneis and metastasis by directly controlling the expression of Dicer (a microRNA-processing enzyme) and Dicer-regulated microRNAs. Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) and the enzymes that control their processing have been reported in multiple biological processes including primary and metastatic tumours1,2,3,4,5,6, but the mechanisms governing this are not clearly understood. Here we show that TAp63, a p53 family member, suppresses tumorigenesis and metastasis, and coordinately regulates Dicer and miR-130b to suppress metastasis. Metastatic mouse and human tumours deficient in TAp63 express Dicer at very low levels, and we found that modulation of expression of Dicer and miR-130b markedly affected the metastatic potential of cells lacking TAp63. TAp63 binds to and transactivates the Dicer promoter, demonstrating direct transcriptional regulation of Dicer by TAp63. These data provide a novel understanding of the roles of TAp63 in tumour and metastasis suppression through the coordinate transcriptional regulation of Dicer and miR-130b and may have implications for the many processes regulated by miRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W2047948719,"Systemic amyloidosis is a serious disease caused by accumulation of amyloid fibrils in the viscera and connective tissues. Serum amyloid P (SAP) is a normal plasma protein that concentrates within the amyloid deposits. Working in a mouse model of the disease, Mark Pepys and colleagues find that a combination of a drug that depletes circulating SAP and an antibody that targets residual SAP within the deposits results in clearance of amyloid deposits. A humanized version of the anti-SAP antibody has been developed with a view to clinical evaluation of this dual approach. Systemic amyloidosis is a serious disease caused by accumulation of amyloid fibrils in the viscera and connective tissues. Serum amyloid P component (SAP) is a normal plasma protein that concentrates within the amyloid deposits. These authors find that a combination of a drug that depletes circulating SAP and an antibody that targets residual SAP within the deposits results in clearance of amyloid deposits in a mouse model of the disease. Accumulation of amyloid fibrils in the viscera and connective tissues causes systemic amyloidosis, which is responsible for about one in a thousand deaths in developed countries1. Localized amyloid can also have serious consequences; for example, cerebral amyloid angiopathy is an important cause of haemorrhagic stroke. The clinical presentations of amyloidosis are extremely diverse and the diagnosis is rarely made before significant organ damage is present1. There is therefore a major unmet need for therapy that safely promotes the clearance of established amyloid deposits. Over 20 different amyloid fibril proteins are responsible for different forms of clinically significant amyloidosis and treatments that substantially reduce the abundance of the respective amyloid fibril precursor proteins can arrest amyloid accumulation1. Unfortunately, control of fibril-protein production is not possible in some forms of amyloidosis and in others it is often slow and hazardous1. There is no therapy that directly targets amyloid deposits for enhanced clearance. However, all amyloid deposits contain the normal, non-fibrillar plasma glycoprotein, serum amyloid P component (SAP)2,3. Here we show that administration of anti-human-SAP antibodies to mice with amyloid deposits containing human SAP triggers a potent, complement-dependent, macrophage-derived giant cell reaction that swiftly removes massive visceral amyloid deposits without adverse effects. Anti-SAP-antibody treatment is clinically feasible because circulating human SAP can be depleted in patients by the bis-d-proline compound CPHPC4, thereby enabling injected anti-SAP antibodies to reach residual SAP in the amyloid deposits. The unprecedented capacity of this novel combined therapy to eliminate amyloid deposits should be applicable to all forms of systemic and local amyloidosis."
https://openalex.org/W2012932442,"Various biological processes are driven by the day/night cycle to occur at a certain time of day. One way the circadian system exerts these effects is through post-transcriptional regulation. Sanchez et al. show that PRMT5, a protein that transfers methyl groups onto subunits of the spliceosome — the complex that cuts non-protein-coding stretches from pre-RNA — is regulated by the light/dark cycle. This affects alternative splicing of some genes, making them subject to circadian control. This work shows one way by which the environment alters gene expression. Various biological processes are entrained by the day–night cycle to occur at a specific time of day. One way the circadian system exerts these effects is through post-transcriptional regulation. These authors show that a protein that transfers methyl groups onto several spliceosome subunits, PRMT5, is regulated by the light–dark cycle. Methylation of these subunits affects alternative splicing of some genes, thus making them subject to circadian control. Circadian rhythms allow organisms to time biological processes to the most appropriate phases of the day–night cycle1. Post-transcriptional regulation is emerging as an important component of circadian networks2,3,4,5,6, but the molecular mechanisms linking the circadian clock to the control of RNA processing are largely unknown. Here we show that PROTEIN ARGININE METHYL TRANSFERASE 5 (PRMT5), which transfers methyl groups to arginine residues present in histones7 and Sm spliceosomal proteins8,9, links the circadian clock to the control of alternative splicing in plants. Mutations in PRMT5 impair several circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis thaliana and this phenotype is caused, at least in part, by a strong alteration in alternative splicing of the core-clock gene PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 9 (PRR9). Furthermore, genome-wide studies show that PRMT5 contributes to the regulation of many pre-messenger-RNA splicing events, probably by modulating 5′-splice-site recognition. PRMT5 expression shows daily and circadian oscillations, and this contributes to the mediation of the circadian regulation of expression and alternative splicing of a subset of genes. Circadian rhythms in locomotor activity are also disrupted in dart5-1, a mutant affected in the Drosophila melanogaster PRMT5 homologue, and this is associated with alterations in splicing of the core-clock gene period and several clock-associated genes. Our results demonstrate a key role for PRMT5 in the regulation of alternative splicing and indicate that the interplay between the circadian clock and the regulation of alternative splicing by PRMT5 constitutes a common mechanism that helps organisms to synchronize physiological processes with daily changes in environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2016634228,"Transmembrane signals initiated by a broad range of extracellular stimuli converge on nodes that regulate phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent inositol lipid hydrolysis for signal propagation. We describe how heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) activate PLC-βs and in turn are deactivated by these downstream effectors. The 2.7-angstrom structure of PLC-β3 bound to activated Gα(q) reveals a conserved module found within PLC-βs and other effectors optimized for rapid engagement of activated G proteins. The active site of PLC-β3 in the complex is occluded by an intramolecular plug that is likely removed upon G protein-dependent anchoring and orientation of the lipase at membrane surfaces. A second domain of PLC-β3 subsequently accelerates guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis by Gα(q), causing the complex to dissociate and terminate signal propagation. Mutations within this domain dramatically delay signal termination in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, this work suggests a dynamic catch-and-release mechanism used to sharpen spatiotemporal signals mediated by diverse sensory inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2126906211,"Volatiles Versus Vegetation Plants act as both global sources and sinks of highly reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Models typically treat the uptake and degradation of these compounds as if they are mostly unreactive, like other more commonly studied biogenic gases such as ozone. A study by Karl et al. (p. 816 , published online 21 October) suggests that VOCs may be more reactive than expected. By monitoring six field sites representing a range of deciduous ecosystems, several oxidized VOCs were found to have high deposition fluxes. Fumigation experiments in the laboratory confirmed that leaves are capable of oxidizing these compounds, and do so through an enzymatic detoxification or stress-response mechanism. Budgets for VOC flux in the atmosphere suggests that, on a global scale, plants may take up significant levels of VOCs in polluted regions, especially in the tropics."
https://openalex.org/W2111125193,"G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) oligomerization has been observed in a wide variety of experimental contexts, but the functional significance of this phenomenon at different stages of the life cycle of class A GPCRs remains to be elucidated. Rhodopsin (Rh), a prototypical class A GPCR of visual transduction, is also capable of forming dimers and higher order oligomers. The recent demonstration that Rh monomer is sufficient to activate its cognate G protein, transducin, prompted us to test whether the same monomeric state is sufficient for rhodopsin phosphorylation and arrestin-1 binding. Here we show that monomeric active rhodopsin is phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) as efficiently as rhodopsin in the native disc membrane. Monomeric phosphorylated light-activated Rh (P-Rh*) in nanodiscs binds arrestin-1 essentially as well as P-Rh* in native disc membranes. We also measured the affinity of arrestin-1 for P-Rh* in nanodiscs using a fluorescence-based assay and found that arrestin-1 interacts with monomeric P-Rh* with low nanomolar affinity and 1:1 stoichiometry, as previously determined in native disc membranes. Thus, similar to transducin activation, rhodopsin phosphorylation by GRK1 and high affinity arrestin-1 binding only requires a rhodopsin monomer."

https://openalex.org/W2033218458,"Two forms of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) ensure the selective silencing of female sex chromosomes during mouse embryogenesis. Imprinted XCI begins with the detection of Xist RNA expression on the paternal X chromosome (Xp) at about the four-cell stage of embryonic development. In the embryonic tissues of the inner cell mass, a random form of XCI occurs in blastocysts that inactivates either Xp or the maternal X chromosome (Xm). Both forms of XCI require the non-coding Xist RNA that coats the inactive X chromosome from which it is expressed. Xist has crucial functions in the silencing of X-linked genes, including Rnf12 (refs 3, 4) encoding the ubiquitin ligase RLIM (RING finger LIM-domain-interacting protein). Here we show, by targeting a conditional knockout of Rnf12 to oocytes where RLIM accumulates to high levels, that the maternal transmission of the mutant X chromosome (Δm) leads to lethality in female embryos as a result of defective imprinted XCI. We provide evidence that in Δm female embryos the initial formation of Xist clouds and Xp silencing are inhibited. In contrast, embryonic stem cells lacking RLIM are able to form Xist clouds and silence at least some X-linked genes during random XCI. These results assign crucial functions to the maternal deposit of Rnf12/RLIM for the initiation of imprinted XCI."
https://openalex.org/W1992212074,"The existence of a local renin angiotensin system (RAS) of the kidney has been established. Angiotensinogen (AGT), renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin receptors, and high concentrations of luminal angiotensin II have been found in the proximal tubule. Although functional data have documented the relevance of a local RAS, the dualism between biosynthesis and endocytotic uptake of its components and their cellular processing has been incompletely understood. To resolve this, we have selectively analyzed their distribution, endocytosis, transcytosis, and biosynthesis in the proximal tubule. The presence of immunoreactive AGT, restricted to the early proximal tubule, was due to its retrieval from the ultrafiltrate and storage in endosomal and lysosomal compartments. Cellular uptake was demonstrated by autoradiography of radiolabeled AGT and depended on intact endocytosis. AGT was identified as a ligand of the multiple ligand-binding repeats of megalin. AGT biosynthesis was restricted to the proximal straight tubule, revealing substantial AGT mRNA expression. Transgenic AGT overexpression under the control of an endogenous promoter was also restricted to the late proximal tubule. Proximal handling of renin largely followed the patterns of AGT, whereas its local biosynthesis was not significant.

The role of ACE2, an ACE homologue that is highly expressed in the proximal tubule, has received recent interest because ACE2 may counterbalance classical RAS effects in part by metabolizing Ang II to the heptapeptide, Ang-(1–7), which activates the receptor Mas, thus antagonizing the effects of local Ang II (26.Burns K.D. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2007; 16: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27.Warner F.J. Lew R.A. Smith A.I. Lambert D.W. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. J. Biol.

Despite abundant evidence for the expression and function of RAS components in the proximal nephron, we are still left with an incomplete picture of their precise localization with regard to the dualism between local biosynthesis and endocytotic uptake/intracellular processing. In the present study we therefore focused on renin-substrate handling and revisited the presence of other RAS components in proximal tubule. To understand the role of endocytosis herein, we have studied the principal scavenger receptor megalin, which is central to the uptake of a wide spectrum of ligands from proximal tubular fluid by means of its large extracellular ligand-binding domains (28.Christensen E.I. Verroust P.J. Nielsen R. Pflügers Arch. 2009; 458: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 29.Saito A. Sato H. Iino N. Takeda T. J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2010; 2010: 1-7Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We could demonstrate (i) that substantial amounts of AGT, as shown earlier for renin, reach the primary ultrafiltrate and that AGT is endocytosed via megalin; (ii) that renin distribution follows the pattern of AGT; (iii) that uptake of these components is restricted to the early proximal tubule, whereas the late proximal tubule only shows AGT mRNA transcription but no cellular storage; (iv) that ACE expression is also concentrated in late proximal tubule, whereas ACE2 is encountered along the entire proximal nephron; and (v) that ACE and ACE2 display regulatory differences with respect to their apical representation. These data allowed us to reconsider the contributions of individual RAS components along the proximal nephron. Experiments were performed on male Hannover Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, transgenic rats overexpressing human AGT (TGR[hAGT]/line 1623) (30.Ganten D. Wagner J. Zeh K. Bader M. Michel J.B. Paul M. Zimmermann F. Ruf P. Hilgenfeldt U. Ganten U. Kaling M. Bachmann S. Mullins J.J. Murakami K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 7806-7810Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and megalin conditional knock-out mice (megalin lox/lox; apoE Cre) (31.Leheste J.R. Melsen F. Wellner M. Jansen P. Schlichting U. Renner-Müller I. Andreassen T.T. Wolf E. Bachmann S. Nykjaer A. Willnow T.E. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) termed Cre(+) and control mice (megalin lox/lox) termed Cre(−). The rats weighed 250–300 g, and the mice weighed 20–30 g. Remnant megalin expression in Cre(+) was verified by sampling of urinary vitamin D-binding protein levels (31.Leheste J.R. Melsen F. Wellner M. Jansen P. Schlichting U. Renner-Müller I. Andreassen T.T. Wolf E. Bachmann S. Nykjaer A. Willnow T.E. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The mice (n = 24) were divided into one group for perfusion-fixation and immunohistochemical evaluation and another for biochemical analysis. The animals were allowed free access to standard chow and tap water. The experiments were conducted in accordance to the German Law for the protection of animals. Opossum kidney (OK) cells were provided by J. Biber (Zurich, Switzerland). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 in high glucose (450 mg/dl) DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For transport studies, OK cells were seeded on membranes (0.4-μm pore size; PET, Falcon). Before seeding the cells, each filter was pretreated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The formation of polarized monolayers was assessed by measuring transepithelial resistance. Monolayers were considered optimal for transport analyses when the trans-epithelial resistance exceeded 180 Ω·cm2. Purified AGT from rat plasma (32.Hilgenfeldt U. Hackenthal E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 708: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was iodinated with Na125I; the 125I-labeled AGT was then separated from the free iodine by high performance liquid chromatography (33.Iwao H. Nakamura N. Ikemoto F. Yamamoto K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1983; 31: 776-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). SD rats (n = 4) were ether-anesthetized and received a 125I-AGT bolus of 3 μCi/10 g of body weight, dissolved in 0.9% NaCl, or vehicle via the jugular vein. 20 and 60 min after bolus injection, the rats were perfusion-fixed, and the kidneys were removed, frozen, and sectioned in a cryostat. The sections were mounted on glass slides, kept at −20 °C for 3 weeks to decrease radioactivity, dipped in photoemulsion (Ilford), developed after 1 week of exposure, counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin, and coverslipped. The mice and rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (0.06 mg/g of body weight). The kidneys were then perfused retrogradely via the abdominal aorta with 3% paraformaldehyde as described (34.Theilig F. Bostanjoglo M. Pavenstädt H. Grupp C. Holland G. Slosarek I. Gressner A.M. Russwurm M. Koesling D. Bachmann S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2209-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For cryostat sectioning, the tissues were protected from freezing artifacts by subsequent overnight immersion in PBS adjusted to 800 mosmol/kg H2O sucrose, shock frozen, and stored at −80 °C. For the paraffin technique, the tissues were postfixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, and standard paraffin-embedded. For isolation of cortical brush-border membrane (BBM), the kidneys were surgically removed and shock frozen, and the cortices were homogenized in isolation buffer containing 300 mm d-mannitol, 5 mm EGTA, 16 mm HEPES, 10 mm Tris base, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science) as described (35.Biber J. Stieger B. Haase W. Murer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 36.Bachmann S. Schlichting U. Geist B. Mutig K. Petsch T. Bacic D. Wagner C.A. Kaissling B. Biber J. Murer H. Willnow T.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 892-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Purity of the preparation was checked by controlling for the activity of BBM marker enzymes γ-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase in BBM fractions versus total homogenate using the appropriate kits (Roche Applied Science). Total protein concentration was measured using BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) and controlled by Coomassie staining. After Laemmli's sample buffer was added, the proteins were solubilized at 96 °C for 3 min. SDS gel electrophoresis was performed on 8–10% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoretic transfer of the proteins to nitrocellulose membranes, equity in protein loading and blotting was verified by membrane staining using 0.1% Ponceau red. The membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies and then exposed to HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO). Immunoreactive bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) before exposure to x-ray films (Hyperfilm; Amersham Biosciences). For densitometric evaluation of the resulting bands, the films were scanned and analyzed using BIO-PROFIL Bio-1D image software (Vilber Lourmat). All of the parameters were normalized to β-actin abundance. The following previously characterized or commercially acquired antibodies were used: rabbit anti-rAGT recognizing both hAGT and rAGT (32.Hilgenfeldt U. Hackenthal E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 708: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), goat anti-renin (R & D Systems), guinea pig anti-megalin (37.Theilig F. Kriz W. Jerichow T. Schrade P. Hähnel B. Willnow T. Le Hir M. Bachmann S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18: 1824-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-ACE (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-ACE2 (R & D Systems), monoclonal mouse anti-c-Myc (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), rat anti-LAMP-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-Rab11 (BD Transduction), mouse anti-clathrin (Progen), and mouse anti-EEA1 (BD Transduction). Immunohistochemical staining was performed on cryostat or paraffin sections of kidneys or on paraformaldehyde-fixed OK cell monolayers. Sections or cells were blocked with 5% skim milk/PBS, incubated with the appropriate antibody and suitable HRP-, cy-2-, or cy-3-coupled secondary antibodies (DAKO, Dianova). For double labeling, the different primary antibodies were administered consecutively. Tissues from at least six rats or mice were evaluated after perfusion fixation. To demonstrate colocalization of different markers by double staining, at least eight cryosections from each tissue were evaluated. Specificity was controlled by parallel incubation of consecutive sections, each incubated only with one single probe. The sections were analyzed using a Leica DMRB microscope or a multilaser confocal scanning microscope (TCS SP-2; Leica Microsystems). For nonradioactive in situ hybridization, digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were generated by in vitro transcription of a 1200-nucleotide rat AGT cDNA fragment from the coding region. In situ hybridization was performed on 5-μm-thick paraffin sections according to an established protocol (34.Theilig F. Bostanjoglo M. Pavenstädt H. Grupp C. Holland G. Slosarek I. Gressner A.M. Russwurm M. Koesling D. Bachmann S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2209-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Bachmann S. Peters J. Engler E. Ganten D. Mullins J. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 24-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To more sensitively detect AGT mRNA, radiolabeled in situ hybridization was performed using a 290-nucleotide rat AGT cDNA fragment (PvuII/BamHI) that was subcloned in a pGEM4 vector, linearized with EcoRI, and transcribed in the presence of α-35S-labeled UTP (DuPont) (30.Ganten D. Wagner J. Zeh K. Bader M. Michel J.B. Paul M. Zimmermann F. Ruf P. Hilgenfeldt U. Ganten U. Kaling M. Bachmann S. Mullins J.J. Murakami K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 7806-7810Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed on 5-μm-thick cryostat sections, and signal was generated by exposure to photoemulsion (Ilford) covering the sections. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin. For control, sense probes were applied in parallel with antisense probes throughout. To quantify steady state AGT mRNA in rat proximal tubules, an established protocol was used (39.Willmann J.K. Bleich M. Rizzo M. Schmidt-Hieber M. Ullrich K.J. Greger R. Pflugers Arch. 1997; 434: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, normal male Hannover SD rats (Janvier, France; 175–215 g of body weight) were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation; after flank incision the left renal artery was exposed, and the left kidney perfused immediately with 1 mg/ml collagenase type II (PAN Biotech) and 1 mg/ml protease XIV (Roche Applied Science) in 0.8 ml of isolation buffer (140 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.4 mmol/liter KH2PO4, 1.6 mmol/liter K2HPO4, 1 mmol/liter MgSO4, 10 mmol/liter sodium acetate, 1 mmol/liter α-ketoglutarate, 1.3 mmol/liter calcium gluconate, 5 mmol/liter glycine, containing 48 mg/liter trypsin inhibitor and 25 mg/liter DNase I, pH 7.4, at 37 °C). The kidney was removed quickly, decapsulated, cut into slices (0.2–0.4 mm), and transferred in fresh isolation buffer to a thermo shaker (Eppendorf; 850 rpm, 10 min, 37 °C). The resulting tubule suspensions were then transferred to ice-cold isolation buffer containing 1 mg/ml albumin. After sedimentation, the tubules were washed again. Sorting of tubules was performed at 4 °C using a dissection microscope (Leica MZ16) within a time frame of 90 min. The tubules were sorted according to their morphology (supplemental Fig. S1); PT S1 segments were identified by their attachment to glomeruli and tight convolutions, PT S1/S2 segments were identified by their greater length and wider convolutions, and PT S3 segments were identified by their straight course, opaque appearance, slight, corkscrew-like windings, and their transitions to the descending thin limbs. Kidneys from eight rats were prepared. From each rat, three batches were used, each containing 30–50 tubules. In parallel, liver samples from three SD rats were analyzed. Total RNA was isolated from the isolated tubule preparations using an RNeasy-total-RNA-kit (Qiagen). Contaminating DNA was removed after treatment with DNA-free DNase (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of 5 μg of RNA from each preparation using a cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Gene expression of AGT was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR using the TaqMan® system based on real time detection of accumulated fluorescence in a 7500 fast RT-PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Fluorescence for each cycle was analyzed quantitatively, and gene expression was normalized relative to the expression of the housekeeping gene GAPDH mRNA. Specific TaqMan® gene expression assays for AGT and GAPDH were generated by Applied Biosystems (catalogue numbers Rn 00593114-m1 and 43523338E). Expression of AGT was presented as the percentage of GAPDH. Sample analysis was performed in triplicate in a blinded fashion. Receptor-associated protein (RAP) and AGT were used as GST fusion proteins. To generate rat AGT expression constructs, nucleotide sequences corresponding to amino acids 25–477 were cloned into pGEX-4T-1. The production of GST, RAP-GST, and AGT-GST was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Bioscience). The megalin domains, ligand-binding repeats (LBRs) 1–4 and the C terminus including the transmembrane domain, were cloned into pCEP-Pu containing N-terminal His6 and Myc tags. The constructs were transfected into HEK cells. The resulting proteins were used for pulldown assays. Fusion proteins RAP-GST, AGT-GST, and GST alone were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated either with BBM fractions from mouse kidney cortices or with lysates from HEK cells containing megalin receptor LBRs 1–4 or C terminus, dissolved in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 5 mm CaCl2 supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After extensive washing with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, the eluates were loaded on SDS-PAGE, and silver staining or Western blot analysis using anti-megalin or anti-Myc antibody was performed. OK cells were cultured at 37 °C on inserts of a PET transfilter system (0.4-μm pore size; Falcon) placed in 6-well plates. The cells were confluent and revealed polar organization and formation of tight junctions, thus allowing us to trace the passage of molecules across the cell layer. The tightness of the cell layers was assessed by measuring transepithelial resistance and paracellular transport (see below). Human AGT and Ang II were purchased (Sigma-Aldrich). 24 h prior to the experiment, the cells were incubated with FCS-free medium. To study transcytosis, the cells were incubated either with Ang II or AGT alone (each 10 μg/ml) or combined with 200 μg/ml RAP-GST or 10 μm colchicine (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively. The cells were also incubated simultaneously with Ang II and 10 μm valsartan. Samples with medium alone served as controls. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least five times. After 1 h, fluids from the lower chamber were collected and analyzed for AGT by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by Western blot; graded quantities of AGT (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 μg/ml) serving as a standard were processed alike. Ang II was analyzed by enzyme immunoassay (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals Inc.; no cross-reactivity with Ang-(1–7)). FITC-dextran (5 kDa) was used at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml in FCS-free cell culture medium and added to the apical compartment of filters. After 1 h, aliquots from the upper and lower compartments were collected, and the concentration of FITC-dextran was determined by photofluorometry (excitation, 492 nm; emission, 520 nm; Shimadzu RF5000). The results were compared with those obtained in filters without cells. Quantitative data are presented as the means ± S.E. For statistical comparison, the Mann-Whitney U test was employed. p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. In situ hybridization in normal SD rats using 35S-radiolabeled AGT cRNA revealed proximal tubular signal with restriction to the proximal straight tubules (PST; S2 and S3 segments; Fig. 1A). To corroborate these results, nonradioactive in situ hybridization was performed in transgenic TGR(hAGT1623) rats carrying the entire genomic human AGT gene including its 5′-flanking sequences (30.Ganten D. Wagner J. Zeh K. Bader M. Michel J.B. Paul M. Zimmermann F. Ruf P. Hilgenfeldt U. Ganten U. Kaling M. Bachmann S. Mullins J.J. Murakami K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 7806-7810Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar); although physiologically irrelevant because of the inability of endogenous rat renin to cleave the human AGT, the construct targets its overexpression to the regular sites of synthesis including liver and brain with the result of ∼10-fold higher plasma human AGT concentrations compared with endogenous AGT (30.Ganten D.

The goal of this event, the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) experiment, was to search for water and other volatiles in the soil of one of the coldest places on the Moon: the permanently shadowed region within the Cabeus crater. Using ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectroscopy data from accompanying craft, Colaprete et al. (p. 463 ; see the news story by Kerr ; see the cover) found evidence for the presence of water and other volatiles within the ejecta cloud. Schultz et al. (p. 468 ) monitored the different stages of the impact and the resulting plume. Gladstone et al. (p. 472 ), using an ultraviolet spectrograph onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), detected H 2 , CO, Ca, Hg, and Mg in the impact plume, and Hayne et al. (p. 477 ) measured the thermal signature of the impact and discovered that it had heated a 30 to 200 square-meter region from ∼40 kelvin to at least 950 kelvin. Paige et al. (p. 479) mapped cryogenic zones predictive of volatile entrapment, and Mitrofanov et al. (p. 483 ) used LRO instruments to confirm that surface temperatures in the south polar region persist even in sunlight. In all, about 155 kilograms of water vapor was emitted during the impact; meanwhile, the LRO continues to orbit the Moon, sending back a stream of data to help us understand the evolution of its complex surface structures."
https://openalex.org/W1965309755,"Electrophoresis is a motion of charged dispersed particles relative to a fluid in a uniform electric field. The effect is widely used to separate macromolecules, to assemble colloidal structures, to transport particles in nano- and micro-fluidic devices and displays. Typically, the fluid is isotropic (for example, water) and the electrophoretic velocity is linearly proportional to the electric field. In linear electrophoresis, only a direct current (DC) field can drive the particles. An alternate current (AC) field is more desirable because it allows one to overcome problems such as electrolysis and absence of steady flows. Here we show that when the electrophoresis is performed in a nematic fluid, the effect becomes strongly non-linear with a velocity component that is quadratic in the applied voltage and has a direction that generally differs from the direction of linear velocity. The new phenomenon is caused by distortions of the LC orientation around the particle that break the fore-aft (or left-right) symmetry. The effect allows one to transport both charged and neutral particles, even when the particles themselves are perfectly symmetric (spherical), thus enabling new approaches in display technologies, colloidal assembly, separation, microfluidic and micromotor applications."

Lehnert et al. now report that UDFy-38135539 is at a redshift of z = 8.6. The galaxy was first identified as a candidate z ≈ 8.6 object in deep Wide Field Camera 3 observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, and the discovery in ground-based observations that it is emitting Lyman-α photons provides confirmation. This single source is unlikely to provide enough photons to ionize the volume necessary for the emission line to escape, requiring a significant contribution from other, probably fainter galaxies nearby. Until now, the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxies known in the Universe were at redshifts of z = 8.2 and z = 6.96. It is now reported that the galaxy UDFy-38135539 is at a redshift of z = 8.5549 ± 0.0002. The finding has implications for our understanding of the timing, location and nature of the sources responsible for reionization of the Universe after the Big Bang. Galaxies had their most significant impact on the Universe when they assembled their first generations of stars. Energetic photons emitted by young, massive stars in primeval galaxies ionized the intergalactic medium surrounding their host galaxies, cleared sightlines along which the light of the young galaxies could escape, and fundamentally altered the physical state of the intergalactic gas in the Universe continuously until the present day1,2. Observations of the cosmic microwave background3, and of galaxies and quasars at the highest redshifts4, suggest that the Universe was reionized through a complex process that was completed about a billion years after the Big Bang, by redshift z ≈ 6. Detecting ionizing Lyman-α photons from increasingly distant galaxies places important constraints on the timing, location and nature of the sources responsible for reionization. Here we report the detection of Lyα photons emitted less than 600 million years after the Big Bang. UDFy-38135539 (ref. 5) is at a redshift of z = 8.5549 ± 0.0002, which is greater than those of the previously known most distant objects, at z = 8.2 (refs 6 and 7) and z = 6.96 (ref. 8). We find that this single source is unlikely to provide enough photons to ionize the volume necessary for the emission line to escape, requiring a significant contribution from other, probably fainter galaxies nearby9."

Although diminution in d-serine level has been implicated in NMDA receptor hypofunction, which is thought to occur in schizophrenia, the source of the precursor l-serine and its role in d-serine metabolism in adult brain have yet to be determined. We investigated whether l-serine synthesized in brain via the phosphorylated pathway is essential for d-serine synthesis by generating mice with a conditional deletion of d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh; EC 1.1.1.95). This enzyme catalyzes the first step in l-serine synthesis via the phosphorylated pathway. HPLC analysis of serine enantiomers demonstrated that both l- and d-serine levels were markedly decreased in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of conditional knock-out mice, whereas the serine deficiency did not alter protein expression levels of serine racemase and NMDA receptor subunits in these regions. The present study provides definitive proof that l-serine-synthesized endogenously via the phosphorylated pathway is a key rate-limiting factor for maintaining steady-state levels of d-serine in adult brain. Furthermore, NMDA-evoked transcription of Arc, an immediate early gene, was diminished in the hippocampus of conditional knock-out mice. Thus, this study demonstrates that in mature neuronal circuits l-serine availability determines the rate of d-serine synthesis in the forebrain and controls NMDA receptor function at least in the hippocampus.

Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain, acting on ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Ionotropic glutamate receptors can be divided into three classes based on their preference for the ligands N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), 3The abbreviations used are: NMDAN-methyl-d-aspartateGFAPglial fibrillary acidic proteinPhgdhd-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenaseSrrSerine racemaseNSEneuron-specific enolase. α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid, and kainate. Among these receptors, NMDA receptors have been implicated in synapse refinement, synaptic plasticity, and learning/memory as well as brain pathologies including excitotoxicity and psychiatric diseases (for review, see Refs. 1.Cull-Candy S.

FEBS J. 2008; 275: 3514-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In the telencephalon, where d-serine is abundant (12.Hashimoto A. Nishikawa T. Oka T. Takahashi K. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), its distribution pattern resembles that of NR2A/B subunits (13.Schell M.J. Brady Jr., R.O. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1604-1615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, immunoreactivity for free glycine is very low in telencephalon and is detected primarily in the hindbrain and hypothalamus, where NR2A/B expression is weaker than in other regions (13.Schell M.J. Brady Jr., R.O. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1604-1615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these contrasting localization patterns, the potency of d-serine for NMDA receptors is comparable with, or greater than, that of glycine (5.Kleckner N.W. Dingledine R. Science. 1988; 241: 835-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 14.Matsui T. Sekiguchi M. Hashimoto A. Tomita U. Nishikawa T. Wada K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). These findings provided a basis for the idea that d-serine is the primary NMDA receptor co-agonist, at least in the telencephalon of mature brain. Degradation of endogenous d-serine by exogenously applied d-amino acid oxidase attenuates NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal transmission in cerebellar, hippocampal, and hypothalamic slices (15.Mothet J.P. Parent A.T. Wolosker H. Brady Jr., R.O. Linden D.J. Ferris C.D. Rogawski M.A. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 4926-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 16.Panatier A.

Furthermore, when d-serine is injected into the brain of live animals, it positively modulates NMDA receptor function (17.Wood P.L. Emmett M.R. Rao T.S. Mick S. Cler J. Iyengar S. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 979-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and ameliorates stereotypical behavioral alterations and ataxia caused by administration of the NMDA antagonist phencyclidine (18.Contreras P.C. Neuropharmacology. 1990; 29: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 19.Tanii Y. Nishikawa T. Hashimoto A. Takahashi K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 269: 1040-1048PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that d-serine may mitigate nervous system symptoms related to NMDA receptor hypofunction, including schizophrenia. Several clinical trials indeed demonstrated significant improvement in negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia patients when combined with antipsychotics (20.Tsai G. Yang P. Chung L.C.

Serine racemase (Srr), which catalyzes the racemization between l- and d-serine, was first purified from mammalian brain by Wolosker et al. (23.Wolosker H. Sheth K.N. Takahashi M. Mothet J.P.

Maximum enzyme activity requires pyridoxal 5′-phosphate as well as divalent cations complexed with ATP, GTP, or ADP (24.Cook S.P. Galve-Roperh I. Martínez del Pozo A. Rodríguez-Crespo I. J. Biol.

The enzyme also has α,β-eliminase activity, which forms pyruvate from l-serine and water (26.Neidle A. Dunlop D.S. Neurochem.

Synthesis of d-serine from l-serine is restricted to the brain of adult rats and mice; other sources of d-serine via blood circulation seem not to play a major role in establishing steady-state levels of this amino acid (29.Dunlop D.S. Neidle A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Genetic deletion of Srr in mice results in a marked decrease in brain d-serine content (30.Inoue R. Hashimoto K. Harai T. Mori H. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31.Basu A.C. Tsai G.E. Ma C.L. Ehmsen J.T. Mustafa A.K. Han L. Jiang Z.I. Benneyworth M.A. Froimowitz M.P. Lange N.

Genet. 2009; 18: 3227-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), providing in vivo evidence that d-serine is synthesized from l-serine by Srr in adult brain. However, the origin of the l-serine precursor in mature brain remains unknown. l-Serine can be derived from the diet, glycine, protein degradation, and/or de novo biosynthesis from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate via the phosphorylated pathway (33.Snell K. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 325-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 34.Hirabayashi Y. Furuya S. Prog. Lipid Res. 2008; 47: 188-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the first step of l-serine biosynthesis, d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh; EC 1.1.1.95) catalyzes the formation of 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate from 3-phosphoglycerate. In the rodent nervous system Phgdh is expressed specifically in a glial cell lineage throughout ontogeny and is enriched mainly in embryonic neuroepithelium and radial glia and thereafter in astrocytes (35.Furuya S. Tabata T. Mitoma J. Yamada K. Yamasaki M. Makino A. Yamamoto T. Watanabe M. Kano M. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 11528-11533Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 36.Yamasaki M. Yamada K. Furuya S. Mitoma J. Hirabayashi Y. Watanabe M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7691-7704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons, in contrast, lack Phgdh mRNA and protein after their final differentiation in the proliferating germinal zone (36.Yamasaki M. Yamada K. Furuya S. Mitoma J. Hirabayashi Y. Watanabe M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7691-7704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, neurons seem to have a diminished capacity for l-serine synthesis. In mature brain, l-serine appears to be supplied to neurons from external sources, such as astrocytes and/or the circulation. PHGDH-deficient patients have lower free serine levels in plasma as well as in cerebrospinal fluid, which is most likely a consequence of their reduced capacity for l-serine synthesis. These patients exhibit severe neurological symptoms including congenital microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, and intractable seizures (37.de Koning T.J. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2006; 29: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cerebrospinal fluid d-serine concentrations in two patients with PHGDH deficiency (ages 2–3 months and 6–7 years) were markedly decreased before serine supplementation. Concentrations of l- and d-serine increased to a normal healthy range after daily oral administration of a high dose of l-serine (38.Fuchs S.A. Dorland L. de Sain-van der Velden M.G. Hendriks M. Klomp L.W. Berger R. de Koning T.J. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting that PHGDH deficiency decreases the overall capacity for l-serine synthesis, which affects cerebrospinal fluid d-serine levels in infants and children. However, whether and to what extent brain-synthesized l-serine contributes to maintaining d-serine levels in mature brain tissues remains unknown. To ascertain whether l-serine synthesized in the brain impacts d-serine levels in mature brain, we conditionally inactivated Phgdh in the nervous system using human glial fibrillary acidic protein (hGFAP)-Cre transgenic mice (39.Zhuo L. Theis M. Alvarez-Maya I. Brenner M. Willecke K. Messing A. Genesis. 2001; 31: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we bypassed the embryonic lethal phenotype observed after systemic deletion of Phgdh (40.Yoshida K. Furuya S. Osuka S. Mitoma J. Shinoda Y. Watanabe M. Azuma N. Tanaka H. Hashikawa T. Itohara S. Hirabayashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3573-3577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We found that intrabrain l-serine availability determines the d-serine level in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The compensatory supply of l-serine from the circulation to the brain is insufficient to maintain normal levels of l- or d-serine in mature brain. A targeting vector for mouse Phgdh was constructed (40.Yoshida K. Furuya S. Osuka S. Mitoma J. Shinoda Y. Watanabe M. Azuma N. Tanaka H. Hashikawa T. Itohara S. Hirabayashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3573-3577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 1A. To produce the conditional Phgdh allele, Cre-mediated deletion of the targeted allele (Phdgh+/neo) was carried out by crossing Phdgh+/neo heterozygous F1 mice with EIIa Cre deleter mice. The F2 offspring showed a variable degree of mosaicism for partially Cre-recombined Phgdh alleles in various tissues, as described (41.Holzenberger M. Lenzner C. Leneuve P. Zaoui R. Hamard G. Vaulont S. Bouc Y.L. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2000; 28: E92Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). F3 mice carrying a conditional Phgdh allele (Phgdh Phgdh+/flox) were obtained by crossing F2 female mosaic mice with wild-type C57BL/6J males. The heterozygous mice were thereafter backcrossed to the C57BL/6J strain for more than 10 generations. Mice with homozygous conditional Phgdh alleles (PhgdhPhgdhflox/flox), hereafter called Floxed, were obtained by intercrossing heterozygous mice (Phgdh+/flox). The presence of a conditional allele (Phgdhflox) was identified by PCR using tail DNA with a primer pair directed against the third intron (forward primer, 5′-CATGAGGAA CTGAACTGAAGGATTGA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAAGGAGGCTCACACATCCCAGAAC-3′), which generated a 310-bp amplicon (Fig. 1B). Mice conditionally lacking Phgdh in astrocytes (hGFAP+/Cre::Phgdhfflox/flox), hereafter called CKO, were obtained by interbreeding female Floxed mice with male Floxed mice carrying the hGFAP-Cre transgene, which were generated by crossing Floxed mice with hGFAP-Cre transgenic mice (39.Zhuo L. Theis M. Alvarez-Maya I. Brenner M. Willecke K. Messing A. Genesis. 2001; 31: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). To detect the Cre transgene used in this study, PCR was carried out with the primers 5′-AATTTGCCTGCATTACCGGTCGATGCAACG-3′ and 5′-CCATTTCCGGTTATTCAACTTGCACCATGC-3′, which generated a 190-bp amplicon of part of the Cre-coding region (Fig. 1B). Mice were maintained in a 12-h light/dark cycle with unlimited access to water and laboratory chow containing 20% casein. The animal experiment protocols for this study were approved by the Animal Ethics Committees of RIKEN Brain Science Institute and Kyushu University. The content of glycine and other amino acids in serum, the cerebral cortex, and hippocampus, pancreas, kidney, liver, and muscle of Floxed and CKO mice (males, 10 weeks old) was determined as described (42.Furuya S. Yoshida K. Kawakami Y. Yang J.H. Sayano T. Azuma N. Tanaka H. Kuhara S. Hirabayashi Y. Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2008; 8: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 43.Kawakami Y. Yoshida K.

Briefly, tissues were weighed and then homogenized individually in 5 volumes of water and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Proteins in the supernatant were removed by adding 5% perchloric acid as described (40.Yoshida K. Furuya S. Osuka S. Mitoma J. Shinoda Y. Watanabe M. Azuma N. Tanaka H. Hashikawa T. Itohara S. Hirabayashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3573-3577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the amino acid composition of the supernatants was determined with an amino acid analyzer (L-8500; Hitachi). Enantiomers of serine were determined using a two-dimensional HPLC system as described (44.Morikawa A. Hamase K. Zaitsu K. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 312: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, amino acids in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and serum of 10-week-old mice were deproteinized as described above and were derivatized with a fluorescent labeling reagent, 4-fluoro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole. The reaction mixture was subjected to a combined HPLC system with a micro-octadecylsilane column and an enantioselective column. The micro-octadecylsilane column isolated the fraction of 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole-Ser, and the enantiomers were separated and determined with the enantioselective column. Fluorescence of the derivatized amino acids was detected at 530 nm with excitation at 470 nm. Some Phgdhflox/flox and hGFAP+/Cre::Phgdhflox/flox mice (females, 8 months old) were administered l-serine (150 mm in saline; 5 mmol/kg; 105–131 μmol/mouse) intraperitoneally. As a control, saline alone was injected intraperitoneally. Mice were decapitated 3 h after the injection because radiolabeled l-serine is degraded promptly within the body but can be detected in adult mouse brain 2–4 h after intraperitoneal administration (29.Dunlop D.S. Neidle A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The cerebral cortex and hippocampus were dissected from adult brain of Floxed and CKO mice (male, 7–11 weeks old) and were then homogenized in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque). Homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min to obtain total protein extracts, and concentrations were determined using a Protein Assay Bicinchoninate kit (Nacalai Tesque). Protein samples were fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). Blotted proteins were probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-Phgdh (rabbit, 0.3 μg/ml) (36.Yamasaki M. Yamada K. Furuya S. Mitoma J. Hirabayashi Y. Watanabe M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7691-7704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), anti-serine racemase (clone 29, mouse monoclonal, BD Biosciences, 1:1000), anti-NMDA receptor subunit NR1 (also known as GluRζ1; rabbit, termed GluRζ1C2 antibody, 1:1000) (45.Abe M. Fukaya M. Yagi T. Mishina M. Watanabe M. Sakimura K. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7292-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), anti-NR2B (also known as GluRϵ2; rabbit, termed GluRϵ2N antibody, 1:1000) (46.Watanabe M. Fukaya M. Sakimura K. Manabe T. Mishina M. Inoue Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 478-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), anti-neuron-specific enolase (NSE) (rabbit, Polysciences, Inc., 1:45000), anti-SNAP 25 (clone BR05, mouse monoclonal, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, 1:500), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap) (rabbit, DAKO, 1:500), and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) (mouse monoclonal, Chemicon, 1:50000). Bound antibodies were visualized with a chemiluminescence detection system (SuperSignal® West Pico, Pierce) after incubating with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling Technology). Floxed and CKO mice (males, 7–8 weeks old) were anesthetized with diethyl ether and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Brains were removed and postfixed overnight in the same fixative followed by washing in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)). For hematoxylin and eosin staining, brains were embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned at 5 μm using a microtome. Wild-type (male, 12 weeks old), Floxed (female, 12–18 weeks old), and CKO (female, 12–18 weeks old) mice were injected intraperitoneally with a subconvulsant dose of NMDA (Sigma, 75 mg/kg body weight in 0.9% saline) (47.Menniti F.S. Pagnozzi M.J. Butler P. Chenard B.L. Jaw-Tsai S.S. Frost White W. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or saline. Floxed and CKO mice used in this experiment were littermates. Mice were anesthetized 3 h after injection and euthanized by decapitation followed by rapid excision of brain from the skull. Each individual hippocampus was quickly isolated from brain on ice, immersed into RNAlater reagent (Ambion) according to the manufacture's instructions, and then stored at −80 °C until used. Total RNA of the hippocampus was prepared using RiboPure kit (Ambion). The quality of total RNA samples was assessed by electrophoresis on a 1% denaturing agarose gels, and samples with A260/A280 of >1.8 were used for subsequent experiments. After removing contaminating DNA in RNA samples with TURBO DNA-free™ (Ambion), 1 μg of DNase-treated RNA was used to generate cDNA by reverse transcription using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with a Model 7500 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) in 20-μl reactions containing SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio) and the reference dye ROX according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Primer sequences used were: Arc forward, 5′-GCCAGTCTTGGGCAGCATAG-3′; Arc reverse, 5′-ATGGCTGAGTCACGGAGCTG-3′. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Data analysis was carried out using the cycle threshold values of target gene expression normalized by Gapdh as the internal control. Our DNA microarray analysis demonstrated that Gapdh was not differentially expressed in the adult hippocampus of Floxed and CKO brains. 4A. Wada and S. Furuya, unpublished observations. Differences between two groups were examined with the Student's t test. Differences among more than two groups were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's post-hoc test. p values ≤0.05 were considered significantly different. All statistics were performed using KaleidaGraph 4.0 (Synergy Software). We generated a conditional allele for mouse Phgdh by introducing two loxP sites flanking exons 4 and 5 (Fig. 1A) (40.Yoshida K. Furuya S. Osuka S. Mitoma J. Shinoda Y. Watanabe M. Azuma N. Tanaka H. Hashikawa T. Itohara S. Hirabayashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3573-3577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Removing these exons by crossing mice having the conditional allele with EIIa-Cre deleter mice produces a frameshift mutation; Phgdh protein expression in Phgdh null embryonic tissues becomes virtually undetectable by Western blotting (40.Yoshida K. Furuya S. Osuka S. Mitoma J. Shinoda Y. Watanabe M. Azuma N. Tanaka H. Hashikawa T. Itohara S. Hirabayashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3573-3577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mice with the homozygous conditional Phgdh alleles, Floxed Phgdh mice (Phgdhflox/flox), developed normally (data not shown). To inactivate serine biosynthesis via the brain phosphorylated pathway, the Phgdh allele was disrupted by crossing female Floxed mice with male mice expressing Cre under the control of the human GFAP promoter (referred to as hGFAP-Cre mice). In hGFAP-Cre mice, it was observed that Cre was first detected in the telencephalon at embryonic day 13.5, and thereafter its expression increased gradually and occurred mainly in astrocytes but also in certain neurons, oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum, and ependymal cells in the lateral ventricle of the mature brain (39.Zhuo L. Theis M. Alvarez-Maya I. Brenner M. Willecke K. Messing A. Genesis. 2001; 31: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). We obtained mice in subsequent generations with the hGFAP+/Cre::Phgdhflox/flox genotype, referred to as CKO (Fig. 1B). Unlike Phgdh null mice (40.Yoshida K. Furuya S. Osuka S. Mitoma J. Shinoda Y. Watanabe M. Azuma N. Tanaka H. Hashikawa T. Itohara S. Hirabayashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3573-3577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), CKO mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio when female Floxed mice were crossed with male CKO mice (data not shown). Littermates with the Floxed genotype were used as normal controls. The efficacy of Cre-mediated deletion of Phgdh was assessed by Western blotting. CKO brain exhibited 20 and 5% levels of Phgdh protein expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, respectively, compared with Floxed mice (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the efficacy of Cre-mediated recombination by the hGFAP-Cre transgene differs among brain regions. We did not observe significant changes in the Phgdh protein content of the kidney, liver, muscle, and pancreas of CKO mice relative to controls (data not shown). We then compared brain morphology between the two genotypes. At postnatal day 0, gross appearance of CKO brain was similar to that of Floxed mice (Fig. 2A). Histological examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained coronal sections demonstrated no overt alterations in overall brain morphology between the two genotypes (Fig. 2B); moreover, there was no significant difference in brain weight (Fig. 2C). At postnatal day 42, however, CKO mice had mild microcephaly with remarkable atrophy of the forebrain (Fig. 2D). Although structural organization of both the cortex and hippocampus was maintained, these regions in CKO appeared smaller than in Floxed controls (Fig. 2E). Consistent with this finding, mean brain weight was subtly yet significantly decreased in CKO mice compared with age-matched Floxed controls (Fig. 2F). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the CKO cortex largely lacked immunoreactivity against Phgdh, but some Gfap-positive and -negative cells were Phgdh positive, whereas Phgdh immunoreactivity was present throughout the gray and white matter and colocalized well with Gfap, an astrocyte-specific marker, in the cerebral cortex of Floxed brain (supplemental Fig. 1), as seen in wild-type mice (36.Yamasaki M. Yamada K. Furuya S. Mitoma J. Hirabayashi Y. Watanabe M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7691-7704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the vast majority of astrocytes showed Cre-mediated recombination, which leads to inactivation of Phgdh expression. The residual expression may be a compensatory response of Cre-negative cells to brain serine deficiency. Detailed analysis of alterations in brain morphology and associated behavior phenotypes will be published elsewhere. We quantified serine enantiomers and other amino acids in serum, the cerebral cortex, and the hippocampus of CKO and Floxed mice. Serum l-serine concentrations did not differ significantly between the two genotypes (Fig. 3A; Student's t test, p = 0.147), whereas the serum d-serine concentration tended to be less in CKO mice (Fig. 3B; Student's t test, p = 0.071). Glycine concentration subtly increased in CKO serum (Fig. 3C; Student's t test, p = 0.071) c"

However, there is currently not much information on their size, shape, stability, surface density, composition, and heterogeneity. We present here a method that allows for the first time the direct imaging of nanoscopic long-lived platforms with raft-like properties diffusing in the live cell plasma membrane. Our method senses these platforms by their property to assemble a characteristic set of fluorescent marker proteins or lipids on a time scale of seconds. A special photobleaching protocol was used to reduce the surface density of labeled mobile platforms down to the level of well isolated diffraction-limited spots without altering the single spot brightness. The statistical distribution of probe molecules per platform was determined by single molecule brightness analysis. For demonstration, we used the consensus raft marker glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored monomeric GFP and the fluorescent lipid analog BODIPY-GM1, which preferentially partitions into liquid-ordered phases. For both markers, we found cholesterol-dependent homo-association in the plasma membrane of living CHO and Jurkat T cells in the resting state, thereby demonstrating the existence of small, mobile, long-lived platforms containing these probes. We further applied the technology to address structural changes in the plasma membrane during fever-type heat shock: at elevated temperatures, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored monomeric GFP homo-association disappeared, accompanied by an increase in the expression of the small heat shock protein Hsp27.

We present here a method that allows for the first time the direct imaging of nanoscopic long-lived platforms with raft-like properties diffusing in the live cell plasma membrane. Our method senses these platforms by their property to assemble a characteristic set of fluorescent marker proteins or lipids on a time scale of seconds. A special photobleaching protocol was used to reduce the surface density of labeled mobile platforms down to the level of well isolated diffraction-limited spots without altering the single spot brightness. The statistical distribution of probe molecules per platform was determined by single molecule brightness analysis. For demonstration, we used the consensus raft marker glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored monomeric GFP and the fluorescent lipid analog BODIPY-GM1, which preferentially partitions into liquid-ordered phases. For both markers, we found cholesterol-dependent homo-association in the plasma membrane of living CHO and Jurkat T cells in the resting state, thereby demonstrating the existence of small, mobile, long-lived platforms containing these probes. We further applied the technology to address structural changes in the plasma membrane during fever-type heat shock: at elevated temperatures, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored monomeric GFP homo-association disappeared, accompanied by an increase in the expression of the small heat shock protein Hsp27."

In addition to iron, it is regulated by inflammation and hypoxia, although mechanisms of hypoxic regulation remain unclear. In hepatocytes, hepcidin is induced by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) through a receptor complex requiring hemojuvelin (HJV) as a co-receptor. Type II transmembrane serine proteinase (TMPRSS6) antagonizes hepcidin induction by BMPs by cleaving HJV from the cell membrane. Inactivating mutations in TMPRSS6 lead to elevated hepcidin levels and consequent iron deficiency anemia. Here we demonstrate that TMPRSS6 is up-regulated in hepatic cell lines by hypoxia and by other activators of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). We show that TMPRSS6 expression is regulated by both HIF-1α and HIF-2α. This HIF-dependent up-regulation of TMPRSS6 increases membrane HJV shedding and decreases hepcidin promoter responsiveness to BMP signaling in hepatocytes. Our results reveal a potential role for TMPRSS6 in hepcidin regulation by hypoxia and provide a new molecular link between oxygen sensing and iron homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2019080454,"Endotoxin is a potent inducer of systemic inflammatory responses in human and rodents. Here, we show that in vivo endotoxin triggers a rapid and transient decline in ATP concentration in human peripheral blood leukocytes and murine peripheral blood leukocytes and liver, which is associated with a brief increase in expression of the autophagy indicator LC3-II. In both of these tissues, the ATP concentration reaches a nadir, and autophagy is induced between 2 and 4 h post-endotoxin infusion, and homeostasis is restored within 12 h. Mouse liver SIRT1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) protein expression levels decline precipitously within 10 min and remain below detection levels for up to 12 h post-endotoxin administration. In marked contrast, the expression of HIF-1α is induced within 90 min and remains elevated for up to 12 h. The ATP recovery is delayed, and the increases in both HIF-1α expression and autophagy are prolonged in endotoxin-challenged SIRT1 liver knock-out mice. Resveratrol prevents the decline in ATP concentration and SIRT1 expression, as well as the increase in HIF-1α expression and autophagy in liver of endotoxin-challenged wild type mice but not in SIRT1 liver knock-out mice. These results provide novel insight into the state of both cellular bioenergetics and metabolic networks during the acute phase of systemic inflammation and suggest a role for SIRT1 in acute metabolic decline, as well as the restoration of metabolic homeostasis during an inflammatory challenge."
https://openalex.org/W1985278711,"The mammalian corticotropin releasing factor (CRF)/urocortin (Ucn) peptide hormones include four structurally similar peptides, CRF, Ucn1, Ucn2, and Ucn3, that regulate stress responses, metabolism, and cardiovascular function by activating either of two related class B G protein-coupled receptors, CRFR1 and CRFR2. CRF and Ucn1 activate both receptors, whereas Ucn2 and Ucn3 are CRFR2-selective. The molecular basis for selectivity is unclear. Here, we show that the purified N-terminal extracellular domains (ECDs) of human CRFR1 and the CRFR2α isoform are sufficient to discriminate the peptides, and we present three crystal structures of the CRFR2α ECD bound to each of the Ucn peptides. The CRFR2α ECD forms the same fold observed for the CRFR1 and mouse CRFR2β ECDs but contains a unique N-terminal α-helix formed by its pseudo signal peptide. The CRFR2α ECD peptide-binding site architecture is similar to that of CRFR1, and binding of the α-helical Ucn peptides closely resembles CRF binding to CRFR1. Comparing the electrostatic surface potentials of the ECDs suggests a charge compatibility mechanism for ligand discrimination involving a single amino acid difference in the receptors (CRFR1 Glu104/CRFR2α Pro-100) at a site proximate to peptide residue 35 (Arg in CRF/Ucn1, Ala in Ucn2/3). CRFR1 Glu-104 acts as a selectivity filter preventing Ucn2/3 binding because the nonpolar Ala-35 is incompatible with the negatively charged Glu-104. The structures explain the mechanisms of ligand recognition and discrimination and provide a molecular template for the rational design of therapeutic agents selectively targeting these receptors."

The goal of this event, the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) experiment, was to search for water and other volatiles in the soil of one of the coldest places on the Moon: the permanently shadowed region within the Cabeus crater. Using ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectroscopy data from accompanying craft, Colaprete et al. (p. 463 ; see the news story by Kerr ; see the cover) found evidence for the presence of water and other volatiles within the ejecta cloud. Schultz et al. (p. 468 ) monitored the different stages of the impact and the resulting plume. Gladstone et al. (p. 472 ), using an ultraviolet spectrograph onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), detected H 2 , CO, Ca, Hg, and Mg in the impact plume, and Hayne et al. (p. 477 ) measured the thermal signature of the impact and discovered that it had heated a 30 to 200 square-meter region from ∼40 kelvin to at least 950 kelvin. Paige et al. (p. 479) mapped cryogenic zones predictive of volatile entrapment, and Mitrofanov et al. (p. 483 ) used LRO instruments to confirm that surface temperatures in the south polar region persist even in sunlight. In all, about 155 kilograms of water vapor was emitted during the impact; meanwhile, the LRO continues to orbit the Moon, sending back a stream of data to help us understand the evolution of its complex surface structures."

MyD88 is a key adaptor molecule in both Toll-like receptor (TLR) and IL-1 receptor superfamily signaling pathways. This is illustrated by the fact that human individuals carrying rare, naturally occurring MYD88 point mutations suffer from reoccurring life-threatening infections. Here we analyzed the functional properties of six reported non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms of MYD88 in an in vitro cellular system. Two variants found in the MyD88 death domain, S34Y and R98C, showed severely reduced NF-κB activation due to reduced homo-oligomerization and IRAK4 interaction. Structural modeling highlights Ser-34 and Arg-98 as residues important for the assembly of the Myddosome, a death domain (DD) post-receptor complex involving the DD of MyD88, IRAK4, and IRAK2 or IRAK1. Using S34Y and R98C as functional probes, our data show that MyD88 homo-oligomerization and IRAK4 interaction is modulated by the MyD88 TIR and IRAK4 kinase domain, demonstrating the functional importance of non-DD regions not observed in a recent Myddosome crystal structure. The differential interference of S34Y and R98C with some (IL-1 receptor, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR7) but not all (TLR9) MyD88-dependent signaling pathways also suggests that receptor specificities exist at the level of the Myddosome.

https://openalex.org/W1999698442,"M33 X-7 is among the most massive X-Ray binary stellar systems known, hosting a rapidly spinning 15.65 Msun black hole orbiting an underluminous 70 Msun Main Sequence companion in a slightly eccentric 3.45 day orbit. Although post-main-sequence mass transfer explains the masses and tight orbit, it leaves unexplained the observed X-Ray luminosity, star's underluminosity, black hole's spin, and eccentricity. A common envelope phase, or rotational mixing, could explain the orbit, but the former would lead to a merger and the latter to an overluminous companion. A merger would also ensue if mass transfer to the black hole were invoked for its spin-up. Here we report that, if M33 X-7 started as a primary of 85-99 Msun and a secondary of 28-32 Msun, in a 2.8-3.1 day orbit, its observed properties can be consistently explained. In this model, the Main Sequence primary transferred part of its envelope to the secondary and lost the rest in a wind; it ended its life as a ~16 Msun He star with a Fe-Ni core which collapsed to a black hole (with or without an accompanying supernova). The release of binding energy and, possibly, collapse asymmetries ""kicked"" the nascent black hole into an eccentric orbit. Wind accretion explains the X-Ray luminosity, while the black hole spin can be natal."

We previously reported that TGF-β down-regulated Par-3 expression in rat proximal tubular epithelial cells, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated by a luciferase reporter assay that miR-491-5p down-regulated the luciferase activity through a binding site in the 3' UTR of Par-3. Overexpression of miR-491-5p dramatically decreased the expression of endogenous Par-3, disrupted tight junction, and resulted in decreased transepithelial resistance. Moreover, miR-491-5p expression was induced by TGF-β1 through the MEK/p38 MAPK pathway. Importantly, miR-491-5p levels were increased significantly in a rat model of obstructive nephropathy, in parallel with decreased Par-3 levels. Taken together, we conclude that up-regulation of miR-491-5p contributes to TGF-β-regulated Par-3 expression. Our study uncovered a novel mechanism by which TGF-β disrupts cell junction."
https://openalex.org/W1988285559,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress causes macrophage cell death within advanced atherosclerotic lesions, thereby contributing to necrotic core formation and increasing the risk of atherothrombotic disease. However’ unlike in advanced lesions’ the appearance of dead/apoptotic macrophages in early lesions is less prominent. Given that activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is detected in early lesion-resident macrophages and can enhance cell survival against ER stress’ we investigated whether UPR activation occurs after monocyte to macrophage differentiation and confers a cytoprotective advantage to the macrophage. Human peripheral blood monocytes were treated with monocyte colony-stimulating factor to induce macrophage differentiation’ as assessed by changes in ultrastructure and scavenger receptor expression. UPR markers, including GRP78, GRP94, and spliced XBP-1, were induced after macrophage differentiation and occurred after a significant increase in de novo protein synthesis. UPR activation after differentiation reduced macrophage cell death by ER stress-inducing agents. Further, GRP78 overexpression in macrophages was sufficient to reduce ER stress-induced cell death. Consistent with these in vitro findings, UPR activation was observed in viable lesion-resident macrophages from human carotid arteries and from the aortas of apoE_/_ mice. However, no evidence of apoptosis was observed in early lesion-resident macrophages from the aortas of apoE_/_ mice.

DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is thought to be involved in NF-κB activation. Here we show that DNA-PK is required for VCAM-1 expression in response to TNF. The phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of I-κBα as well as the serine 536 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB were insufficient for VCAM-1 expression in response to TNF. The requirement for p50 NF-κB in TNF-induced VCAM-1 expression may be associated with its interaction with and phosphorylation by DNA-PK, which appears to be dominant over the requirement for p65 NF-κB activation. p50 NF-κB binding to its consensus sequence increased its susceptibility to phosphorylation by DNA-PK. Additionally, DNA-PK activity appeared to increase the association between p50/p50 and p50/p65 NF-κB dimers upon binding to DNA and after binding of p50 NF-κB to the VCAM-1 promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2168640586,"In higher plants, [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin (Fd) proteins are the unique electron acceptors from photosystem I (PSI). Fds are soluble, and distribute electrons to many enzymes, including Fd:NADP(H) reductase (FNR), for the photoreduction of NADP(+). In addition to well studied [2Fe-2S] Fd proteins, higher plants also possess genes for significantly different, as yet uncharacterized Fd proteins, with extended C termini (FdCs). Whether these FdC proteins function as photosynthetic electron transfer proteins is not known. We examined whether these proteins play a role as alternative electron acceptors at PSI, using quantitative RT-PCR to follow how their expression changes in response to acceptor limitation at PSI, in mutant Arabidopsis plants lacking 90-95% of photosynthetic [2Fe-2S] Fd. Expression of the gene encoding one FdC protein, FdC1, was identified as being strongly up-regulated. We confirmed that this protein was chloroplast localized and increased in abundance on PSI acceptor limitation. We purified the recombinant FdC1 protein, which exhibited a UV-visible spectrum consistent with a [2Fe-2S] cluster, confirmed by EPR analysis. Measurements of electron transfer show that FdC1 is capable of accepting electrons from PSI, but cannot support photoreduction of NADP(+). Whereas FdC1 was capable of electron transfer with FNR, redox potentiometry showed that it had a more positive redox potential than photosynthetic Fds by around 220 mV. These results indicate that FdC1 electron donation to FNR is prevented because it is thermodynamically unfavorable. Based on our data, we speculate that FdC1 has a specific function in conditions of acceptor limitation at PSI, and channels electrons away from NADP(+) photoreduction."

Mutations of the human K(+) channel hKv7.4 lead to post-lingual progressive hearing loss (DFNA2), which affects world-wide population with diverse racial backgrounds. Here, we have generated the spectrum of point mutations in the hKv7.4 that have been identified as diseased mutants. We report that expression of five point mutations in the pore region, namely L274H, W276S, L281S, G285C, and G296S, as well as the C-terminal mutant G321S in the heterologous expression system, yielded non-functional channels because of endoplasmic reticulum retention of the mutant channels. We mimicked the dominant diseased conditions by co-expressing the wild-type and mutant channels. As compared with expression of wild-type channel alone, the blend of wild-type and mutant channel subunits resulted in reduced currents. Moreover, the combinatorial ratios of wild type:mutant and the ensuing current magnitude could not be explained by the predictions of a tetrameric channel and a dominant negative effect of the mutant subunits. The results can be explained by the dependence of cell surface expression of the mutant on the wild-type subunit. Surprisingly, a transmembrane mutation F182L, which has been identified in a pre-lingual progressive hearing loss patient in Taiwan, yielded cell surface expression and functional features that were similar to that of the wild type, suggesting that this mutation may represent redundant polymorphism. Collectively, these findings provide traces of the cellular mechanisms for DFNA2."

However, the use of this technique has been hindered by the scarcity of family genes with the required level of sequence identity in the genome database. We describe here a strategy for collecting metagenomic homologous genes for DNA shuffling from environmental samples by truncated metagenomic gene-specific PCR (TMGS-PCR). Using identified metagenomic gene-specific primers, twenty-three 921-bp truncated lipase gene fragments, which shared 64-99% identity with each other and formed a distinct subfamily of lipases, were retrieved from 60 metagenomic samples. These lipase genes were shuffled, and selected active clones were characterized. The chimeric clones show extensive functional and genetic diversity, as demonstrated by functional characterization and sequence analysis. Our results indicate that homologous sequences of genes captured by TMGS-PCR can be used as suitable genetic material for DNA family shuffling with broad applications in enzyme engineering."

For every replication origin, CUTs of both strands were counted that fully or partially overlapped with the coordinates of the origin. Replication origins were classified into three groups: untranscribed (0 overlapping CUTs), moderately transcribed (1–10 overlapping CUTs), and extensively transcribed (11–43 overlapping CUTs). Tiling array data of the Δrrp6 strain were analyzed as follows. First, the baseline transcription rate of noncoding regions was determined using the signal intensity of probe sets located in intergenic regions, i.e. outside ORFs. To detect replication origins with significantly higher transcription rate, one-sided t tests were used; t tests quantified the difference of means of baseline transcription rate and intensity of probe sets within the coordinates of a given replication origin. Replication origins with insufficient tiling array signal (<10 probe sets) were excluded from the analysis. p values for the remaining 326 origins were corrected for multiple testing (False Discovery Rate, p = 0.05). Based on the above, replication origins were classified into three groups: untranscribed (p > 0.05), moderately transcribed (p < 0.05), and extensively transcribed (p < 10−5). Normalized genome-wide in vivo nucleosome occupancy data for optimal growth conditions (Yeast Peptone Dextrose) were retrieved from Ref. 14Kaplan N. Moore I.K. Fondufe-Mittendorf Y. Gossett A.J.

Nucleosome depletion of replication origins was quantified using one-sided t tests by comparing average genome-wide nucleosome density with origin-specific densities. Resulting p values were corrected for multiple testing (False Discovery Rate, p = 0.05) and classified into nucleosome-depleted origins (p < = 0.05) and origins with genome-wide average nucleosome density (p > 0.05). All Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were congenic with W303. To create GAL-VPS13-ARS loci, the ARSs were inserted into the coding region of the GAL-VPS13 (15Kristjuhan A. Svejstrup J.Q. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4243-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) 3 kb downstream from the beginning of VPS13 coding sequence. The inserted chromosomal positions of amplified ARSs were as follows: ARS605 (Chr6:135943–136180); ARS607 (Chr6:199329–199515); ARS609 (Chr6:256257–256446); ARS409 (Chr4:212368–212673) (Saccharomyces Genome Database). For detection of replication proteins, a C-terminal triple E4 tag was fused to ORC2, MCM4, or CDC45 loci in GAL-VPS13-ARS strains. For efficient α-factor arrest, the BAR1 gene was also deleted in some of those strains. For reference, E4-tagged ORC2 strain with no ARS insertion in GAL-VPS13 gene was also made.

For cell cycle arrest experiments, α-factor mating pheromone (Zymo Research) was used with a final concentration of 5 μm, and cell cycle status during the experiment was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. ChIP assays were performed as described previously (16Kristjuhan A. Walker J. Suka N. Grunstein M. Roberts D. Cairns B.R. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 925-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Whole cell extract from 107 cells was used for ChIP assays with antibodies directed against RNAPII (4H8; Upstate Biotechnology) or anti-E4 tag (1E2; Icosagen). Co-precipitated DNA was analyzed by quantitative PCR using an ABI Prism 7900HT real-time PCR system under standard conditions (40 cycles; 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min). 5× Hot FIREPol EvaGreen qPCR mix (Solis BioDyne) was used. PCRs were done with primer pairs covering coding region of VPS13 gene (3 kb), ARS605, ARS607, ARS609, ARS409, and the chromosome IX telomere region for normalization. RNAPII was normalized to the amount of RNAPII on the constitutively expressed FBA1 gene. The sequences of primers are available on request. For flow cytometry analysis, 0.5 ml of yeast culture was fixed in 10 ml of 70% ethanol overnight at 4 °C and stained with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) in the presence of RNase H (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark and washed afterward in PBS. Cells were subsequently analyzed using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer. Preparation of chromosomal DNA and neutral two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis were carried out as described previously (17Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). 5 μg of nuclear DNA was cleaved with 40 units of NheI (Fermentas) for 4 h at 37 °C. Restriction fragments were separated on the first dimension in 0.4% Tris-Borate-EDTA agarose gels at 0.9 V/cm and 22 °C for 18 h, and second dimension gels were run in 1% TBE-agarose with 300 ng/ml ethidium bromide at 3 V/cm and 4 °C for 14 h. Gels were blotted to nylon membranes by alkaline transfer and hybridized by incubation for 10 h at 65 °C in 7% SDS, 250 mm NaHPO4 (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% BSA followed by three washes of 15 min at 65 °C with 5% SDS, 40 mm NaHPO4 (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA. Hybridization probe was prepared by PCR and covers nucleotides 2573–3259 of VPS13 ORF. Blots were exposed to Storage Phosphor Screens for 3 days, and signals were detected with a Typhoon Trio PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). To find out whether replication origins are transcribed in yeast, we analyzed the expression data of CUTs and regular transcripts from Neil et al. (7Neil H. Malabat C. d'Aubenton-Carafa Y. Xu Z. Steinmetz L.M. Jacquier A. Nature. 2009; 457: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) in the context of replication origin positioning defined as “confirmed ARS” dataset in S. cerevisiae OriDB (12Nieduszynski C.A. Hiraga S. Ak P. Benham C.J. Donaldson A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D40-D46Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Altogether, 336 replication origins were used. First, we analyzed the tiling array data of total transcriptome and compared the transcription of replication origins to the average level of noncoding DNA transcription genome-wide. This analysis revealed that transcription of more than 10% of replication origins was statistically significant (Fig. 1A). However, this approach probably underestimated the fraction of transcribed replication origins because widespread transcription of noncoding DNA in yeast cells can significantly increase the average level of background signal that was calculated for this analysis. To find out more precisely whether noncoding transcription covers the loci of replication origins, we also analyzed the genome-wide locations of CUTs, defined by the SAGE analysis (7Neil H. Malabat C. d'Aubenton-Carafa Y. Xu Z. Steinmetz L.M. Jacquier A. Nature. 2009; 457: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In this case, more than one-third of origins showed at least one CUT-enriched SAGE tag in the dataset, indicating that a significant number of replication origins were transcribed as CUTs (Fig. 1B). Importantly, this analysis revealed 98 additional transcribed origins that were not identified by the tiling array analysis of total transcriptome (Fig. 1C). We also analyzed the nucleosome occupancy data from (14Kaplan N. Moore I.K. Fondufe-Mittendorf Y. Gossett A.J. Tillo D. Field Y. LeProust E.M. Hughes T.R. Lieb J.D. Widom J. Segal E. Nature. 2009; 458: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) to explore whether transcriptional activity in ARS loci could be related to nucleosome density in these regions. Regardless of their transcriptional activity, ∼80% of replication origins were located in regions where the occupancy of nucleosomes was lower than in the genome in average (Fig. 1D). This finding was in accordance with recent genome-wide study of nucleosome occupancy at loci of replication origins showing that ARS consensus sites contain nucleosome-depleted regions that are flanked by positioned nucleosomes (18Berbenetz N.M. Nislow C. Brown G.W. PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001092Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results indicate that transcription of replication origins is common in yeast genome and the origins are transcribed predominantly as CUTs. Although most of the origins in the yeast genome are located in noncoding regions with no or low detectable transcriptional activity, the loci of several efficient and active replication origins, like ARS214, ARS305, ARS432.5, and ARS519, are highly transcribed as CUTs (supplemental Table 1). Because active transcription is antagonistic to replication origin functioning (1Mori S. Shirahige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4447-4452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 2Snyder M. Sapolsky R.J. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell.

Science. 2001; 294: 2357-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), a mechanism to rescue transcriptionally inactivated origins must exist, particularly because some active origins are highly transcribed. To study the influence of transcription on replication complex formation, we inserted different ARS elements (ARS605, ARS607, ARS609, and ARS409) into a galactose-inducible GAL-VPS13 gene 3 kb downstream from the transcription start site (Fig. 2A) and used ChIP to monitor the binding of pre-RC proteins to GAL-VPS13-ARS loci. As insertion of ARS sequences might directly or indirectly terminate the RNAPII-dependent transcription, we first verified that RNAPII can transcribe through the ARS sequences inserted into the GAL-VPS13 locus. We induced GAL-VPS13-ARS transcription by galactose and determined the distribution of RNAPII in the loci. RNAPII was able to transcribe through the ARS sequences as it was detected in the locus both before (at 2.6 kb) and after (at 3.5 kb) the ARS insertion point (Fig. 2B). Although we did observe ∼30% weaker signal of RNAPII at 3.5 kb compared with the 2.6-kb probe, the level of the signal reduction was identical in GAL-VPS13 and GAL-VPS13-ARS strains (Fig. 2B), reflecting the spontaneous abortive transcription in the locus (15Kristjuhan A. Svejstrup J.Q. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4243-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To monitor pre-RC formation in GAL-VPS13-ARS and natural ARS loci, the binding of Orc2 and Mcm4 proteins to the origin regions was determined. We observed ∼6–12-fold enrichment of Orc2 binding to different GAL-VPS13-ARS loci when transcription was repressed, whereas no Orc2 signal was detected in GAL-VPS13 locus without ARS insertion (Fig. 2C). In accordance with previous findings (1Mori S. Shirahige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4447-4452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we also found that in conditions of active transcription, the recruitment of ORC complexes to GAL-VPS13-ARS loci was significantly reduced compared with nontranscribed conditions (Fig. 2C). For reference, the binding of Orc2 protein was also determined in corresponding ARS sequences in their natural chromosomal positions. The overall levels of Orc2 signals in natural ARS sites were very similar to those found in transcriptionally repressed GAL-VPS-ARS loci. However, no significant changes of Orc2 binding were monitored in different growth media in natural ARS loci, indicating that the removal of the ORC from GAL-VPS13-ARS was a result of transcriptional activity in the locus (Fig. 2C). Next we performed analogous experiments with MCM helicase component Mcm4. Similarly to Orc2, Mcm4 also bound GAL-VPS13-ARS loci when transcription was repressed, and it was removed upon transcriptional induction of the locus in two selected strains (Fig. 2D), indicating that the origins were efficiently licensed in transcriptionally inactive GAL-VPS13-ARS loci. Corresponding binding of Mcm4 on natural chromosomal positions was not lost when transcription in GAL-VPS13-ARS was activated (Fig. 2D). To understand further the temporal dynamics of transcription-related removal of ORC and MCM, the GAL-VPS13-ARS607 locus was induced with galactose for 120 min and then repressed with glucose for 30 min. Almost all of the ORC and MCM complexes were removed from GAL-VPS13-ARS607 within 120 min of transcription, and surprisingly, both complexes were quickly reloaded to the locus after repression of the gene (Fig. 3, A and B). Almost half of the pre-repressed amounts of ORC and MCM were achieved within the first 10 min, and 75% of both complexes were rebound after 30 min (Fig. 3, A and B). Reference signals were also obtained from the natural chromosomal locus of ARS607, and no significant changes in different media were monitored during the time course of the experiment (Fig. 3, A and B). As expected, the amount of the RNAPII in GAL-VPS13-ARS607 locus was in reverse correlation with the amounts of pre-RC components (Fig. 3C). The striking speed of foremost MCM reloading after transcriptional repression led us to question whether the MCM complex can be reloaded instantly after transcription stops, or is a transition through the S phase necessary for MCM reloading and relicensing of origins in GAL-VPS13-ARS loci. To clarify this issue we arrested cells with α-factor and monitored the removal and reloading of Mcm4 in conditions where cells were continuously arrested in G1 (Fig. 4A). In all strains used, MCM was removed from GAL-VPS13-ARS loci in response to transcription induction (Fig. 4B). When transcription was subsequently repressed, but cells were restrained in G1 arrest, MCM was reloaded to GAL-VPS13-ARS loci (Fig. 4B). After 60 min of repression, the level of MCM in GAL-VPS13-ARS loci was fully recovered in G1-arrested cells, indicating that transition through S phase is unnecessary for MCM reloading. For reference, the binding of MCM on natural chromosomal positions was also obtained and no MCM removal or reloading was detected during the course of the experiment (Fig. 4C). Having established that transcriptionally removed MCM complexes can be reloaded in G1, we wanted to find out whether relicensed origins were functional and able to initiate replication in the following S phase. To monitor origin firing in the S phase, we detected the recruitment of the Cdc45 protein to the origin. Cdc45 has been shown to associate with origins at the time of replication initiation, and its binding to the origins has been utilized as a reliable marker of origin firing (19Pryde F. Jain D.

Biol. 2004; 24: 4769-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We arrested cells with α-factor and removed pre-RC proteins by transcription. Then we allowed relicensing of origins in repressing medium for 60 min and after that released cells to S phase. Cdc45 binds to GAL-VPS13-ARS609 locus ∼60 min after release from G1 arrest (Fig. 5A; sample Raf-Gal-Glc), indicating that replication was initiated from relicensed origin in S phase of the same cell cycle (Fig. 5B). The timing and efficiency of Cdc45 recruitment to relicensed origin were similar to the GAL-VPS13-ARS609 locus that has been continuously kept in transcriptionally repressing conditions (Fig. 5A; sample Glc). However, when cells were released from the G1 block without prior repression of GAL-VPS13-ARS609 transcription, no recruitment of Cdc45 to the locus was observed (Fig. 5A; sample Raf-Gal). For reference, Cdc45 recruitment to the natural chromosomal locus of ARS609 was also determined. Cdc45 associates with native ARS609 locus also ∼60 min after release into the S phase (Fig. 5A; sample ARS609; Glc), indicating similar firing time of native and GAL-VPS13-ARS609 loci. To confirm further that Cdc45 recruitment to relicensed origin reflects its firing, we also analyzed the patterns of DNA replication intermediates in GAL-VPS13-ARS609 loci that have grown in transcriptionally active or repressed conditions or have been relicensed in G1. The presence of a bubble arc in two-dimensional DNA electrophoresis analysis confirmed firing of relicensed origin in GAL-VPS13-ARS609 locus (Fig. 5C). As expected, origin firing was also detected in cells that were grown continuously in transcriptionally repressing conditions (Fig. 5D), but not in cells where transcription of GAL-VPS13-ARS609 was active before and during release form G1 arrest (Fig. 5E). Our results reveal that at least one-third of replication origins in yeast genome are transcriptionally active, despite their intergenic location. We also confirm that RNAPII-dependent transcription inhibits pre-RC formation and thus abolishes replication origin firing. Nevertheless, our results show that transcription-coupled inactivation of replication origins is reversible in G1, and pre-RC components can be quickly reloaded to origins when transcription stops. Relicensing of transcriptionally inactivated origins fully restores their functionality and leads to their firing in S phase. Several recent studies suggest that active transcription abolishes replication origin firing by inhibiting pre-RC formation (1Mori S. Shirahige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4447-4452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 4Donato J.J. Chung S.C. Tye B.K. PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e141Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although the majority of replication origins in budding yeast are located in intergenic regions of the genome, recent data show that transcription of noncoding regions is widespread in yeast (6David L. Huber W. Granovskaia M. Toedling J. Palm C.J. Bofkin L. Jones T. Davis R.W. Steinmetz L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 5320-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 7Neil H.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3262-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To estimate the fraction of annotated replication origins that are regularly transcribed, we reanalyzed the genome-wide data of yeast transcripts (7Neil H. Malabat C. d'Aubenton-Carafa Y. Xu Z. Steinmetz L.M. Jacquier A. Nature. 2009; 457: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) in the loci of replication origins (12Nieduszynski C.A. Hiraga S. Ak P. Benham C.J. Donaldson A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D40-D46Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our analysis shows that at least one-third of the replication origin sequences are transcribed on regular basis, mostly as CUTs (Fig. 1). In addition, several replication origins are located in otherwise transcriptionally active regions that have significant transcriptional overlap due to normal gene expression (Fig. 1). However, the replication origin placement in yeast genome seems to favor transcriptionally more silent regions, as the number of heavily transcribed origins is significantly smaller than the ones transcribed occasionally (Fig. 1). Although direct transcription through the origins disrupts their function, the replication machinery might benefit from transcription-coupled remodeling and modifications of the chromatin that might help pre-RC components to access DNA and facilitate the initiation of replication. The fact that many replication origins are transcribed raises question about the fate of transcribed origins. As there is an excess of potential origins on chromosomes, cells can afford the inactivation of some of them under normal circumstances. Indeed, not all origins fire in a single S phase, and even the most efficient origins do not fire in every S phase (24Hyrien O. Marheineke K. Goldar A. Bioessays. 2003; 25: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, the activity of those dormant origins becomes critical in stress conditions, when the movement of replication forks initiated from major origins stalls or slows down (25Blow J.J. Ge X.Q. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). An efficient alternative to the transcription-coupled loss of functional origins would be reestablishing of pre-RCs on origins after transcription. To investigate this possibility, we inserted different replication origins into the coding region of an inducible gene and determined the dynamics of pre-RC components in this locus. Our results show that both ORC and MCM complexes were quickly reloaded to origins as soon as transcription was shut down (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4), indicating the possible rescue of replication origins by this mechanism. Importantly, in G1-arrested cells pre-RCs can reform on origins without transition through S phase. After release from G1 arrest, DNA replication initiation protein Cdc45 was recruited to relicensed origin (Fig. 5A), and DNA replication was initiated in S phase (Fig. 5, C–E). Based on these results, we propose that pre-RC assembly in yeast is widely perturbed by sporadic transcription; however, when the transcription bubble has passed the loci of replication origins, pre-RCs can quickly reassemble, ensuring that sufficient amounts of functional replication initiation loci will be available to carry out S phase.

https://openalex.org/W1997700668,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an established model organism for studying neurobiology. UNC-63 is a C. elegans nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) α-subunit. It is an essential component of the levamisole-sensitive muscle nAChR (L-nAChR) and therefore plays an important role in cholinergic transmission at the nematode neuromuscular junction. Here, we show that worms with the unc-63(x26) allele, with its αC151Y mutation disrupting the Cys-loop, have deficient muscle function reflected by impaired swimming (thrashing). Single-channel recordings from cultured muscle cells from the mutant strain showed a 100-fold reduced frequency of opening events and shorter channel openings of L-nAChRs compared with those of wild-type worms. Anti-UNC-63 antibody staining in both cultured adult muscle and embryonic cells showed that L-nAChRs were expressed at similar levels in the mutant and wild-type cells, suggesting that the functional changes in the receptor, rather than changes in expression, are the predominant effect of the mutation. The kinetic changes mimic those reported in patients with fast-channel congenital myasthenic syndromes. We show that pyridostigmine bromide and 3,4-diaminopyridine, which are drugs used to treat fast-channel congenital myasthenic syndromes, partially rescued the motility defect seen in unc-63(x26).

Single-channel recordings from cultured muscle cells from the mutant strain showed a 100-fold reduced frequency of opening events and shorter channel openings of L-nAChRs compared with those of wild-type worms. Anti-UNC-63 antibody staining in both cultured adult muscle and embryonic cells showed that L-nAChRs were expressed at similar levels in the mutant and wild-type cells, suggesting that the functional changes in the receptor, rather than changes in expression, are the predominant effect of the mutation. The kinetic changes mimic those reported in patients with fast-channel congenital myasthenic syndromes. We show that pyridostigmine bromide and 3,4-diaminopyridine, which are drugs used to treat fast-channel congenital myasthenic syndromes, partially rescued the motility defect seen in unc-63(x26). The C. elegans unc-63(x26) mutant may therefore offer a useful model to assist in the development of therapies for syndromes produced by altered function of human nAChRs.

Each subunit has an N-terminal extracellular domain containing residues that form the ligand-binding site and four transmembrane segments, the second of which forms the greater part of the lining of the ion channel. Close to the interface of the N-terminal extracellular domain with the transmembrane region, there is a characteristic Cys-loop motif, a pair of disulfide-bonded cysteines separated by 13 residues, which gives the name to the Cys-loop receptor family. In vertebrate nAChRs, the Cys-loop has been shown to be essential for nAChR assembly (4Green W.N. Wanamaker C.P. J. Biol.

The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans possesses a large nAChR gene family, consisting of at least 29 subunits (6Jones A.K. Sattelle D.B.

Sequence comparisons suggest that several of the C. elegans nAChR subunits such as UNC-38, UNC-63, UNC-29, and LEV-1 more closely resemble human nAChR subunits than other C. elegans subunits (7Jones A.K. Davis P. Hodgkin J. Sattelle D.B. Invert. Neurosci. 2007; 7: 129-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The neuromuscular junction of C. elegans has at least two major pharmacologically distinct classes of nAChRs: levamisole-sensitive (L-nAChRs) and levamisole-insensitive but highly nicotine-sensitive (8Richmond J.E. Jorgensen E.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The α-subunit ACR-16 contributes to the nicotine-sensitive nAChR (9Francis M.M. Evans S.P. Jensen M.

One mutant strain, unc-63(x26), has a disrupted Cys-loop motif due to a cysteine-to-tyrosine (UNC-63 C151Y) substitution (13Culetto E. Baylis H.A. Richmond J.E. Jones A.K. Fleming J.T.

Here, we show the functional impact of this mutation, reporting for the first time the behavioral and physiological consequences of this mutation at the Cys-loop of the C. elegans L-nAChR. Our results show that disruption of the Cys-loop significantly impairs nAChR channel function, thus demonstrating its conserved role throughout the animal kingdom.Mutations of the human muscle nAChR that produce either loss or gain of function can lead to congenital myasthenic syndromes (16Muller J.S. Mihaylova V. Abicht A. Lochmuller H. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2007; 9: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). With much of the machinery required for neuromuscular transmission in mammals conserved in C. elegans, the nematode has emerged as a useful model organism for studying neuromuscular diseases and drug testing (17Francis M.M. Mellem J.E. Maricq A.V. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 90-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Sattelle D.B. Buckingham S.D. Invert.

The unc-63(x26) worm containing the mutant L-nAChR has uncoordinated locomotion due presumably to deficient cholinergic signaling at the neuromuscular junction. Here, we show that this phenotype is partially rescued by drugs used to treat humans for fast-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (FCCMS) by enhancing neuromuscular transmission. The fact that both molecular and phenotypic changes produced by a mutation at a key site of a muscle C. elegans nAChR parallel those observed in humans allows us to propose that the unc-63(x26) strain may permit screening for drugs aimed at alleviating the symptoms of diseases arising from mutations of muscle nAChRs.DISCUSSIONThe unc-63(x26) strain is homozygous for a mutation in the nAChR α-subunit unc-63, an essential constituent of L-nAChRs, which play a major role in cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (8Richmond J.E. Jorgensen E.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 13Culetto E. Baylis H.A. Richmond J.E. Jones A.K. Fleming J.T. Squire M.D. Lewis J.A. Sattelle D.B. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The C151Y mutation disrupts the Cys-loop, a defining feature of nAChRs and Cys-loop receptors (28Lester H.A. Dibas M.I. Dahan D.S. Leite J.F. Dougherty D.A. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) that has been shown to be essential for the correct assembly of nAChR subunits in mammalian cell lines (4Green W.N. Wanamaker C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20945-20953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and necessary for the functional coupling between ligand binding and channel opening in mammalian nAChRs (2Bartos M. Corradi J. Bouzat C. Mol. Neurobiol. 2009; 40: 236-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Bouzat C. Gumilar F. Spitzmaul G. Wang H.L. Rayes D. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Sine S.M.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18207-18212Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The C151Y mutation causes a loss of function as evidenced by a significant decrease in channel open duration and frequency of opening. Increasing agonist concentration does not increase the frequency of openings, which would be expected if saturation had not been achieved due to lower affinity. Moreover, the effects of the mutation on channel properties when activated by levamisole are quantitatively similar to those described for ACh: low frequency of opening and channel openings of briefer duration. These results indicate that changes are not dependent on the type of agonist, as would be expected given that the Cys-loop is located at the extracellular-transmembrane interface and not close to the binding site.We have demonstrated that unc-63(x26) C151Y forms functional receptors (presumably with UNC-38, UNC-29, LEV-1, and LEV-8 (11Boulin T. Gielen M. Richmond J.E. Williams D.C. Paoletti P. Bessereau J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18590-18595Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar)) because L-nAChR channel activity was detected, whereas no channel activity was detected in the null mutant (unc-63(x37)) (Fig. 1). In addition, the use of antibodies raised against UNC-63 revealed a punctate staining pattern in the nerve cord of unc-63(x26) worms (Fig. 4E), which is characteristic of nAChRs assembled and clustered at neuromuscular junctions (31Eimer S. Gottschalk A. Hengartner M. Horvitz H.R. Richmond J. Schafer W.R. Bessereau J.L. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4313-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), similar to that of wild-type strains but distinct from the null mutant. Moreover, immunocytochemistry assays in cultured cells revealed that the UNC-63 C151Y mutation caused no detectable changes in the level of surface expression of L-nAChRs (Fig. 3). We were unable to estimate the opening rate of L-nAChRs because opening events could not be unambiguously attributed to a single channel, as there may be more than one channel present in the recording (21Rayes D. Flamini M. Hernando G. Bouzat C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Bouzat C. Barrantes F. Sine S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the decrease in the frequency of channel openings observed without a corresponding reduction in surface expression levels suggests that the fewer openings in the unc-63(x26) muscle are due to a lower opening rate.Mutations in human muscle nAChRs have been associated with congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) (33Engel A.G. Sine S.M. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2005; 5: 308-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), a group of genetically determined heterogeneous disorders all characterized by muscle weakness (34Vincent A. Beeson D. Lang B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6717-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The syndromes are grouped into nAChR deficiency and kinetic abnormality, which can cause loss (FCCMS) or gain (slow-channel CMS) of function (16Muller J.S. Mihaylova V. Abicht A. Lochmuller H. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2007; 9: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Engel A.G. Sine S.M. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2005; 5: 308-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).FCCMS patients have, in common, greatly reduced nAChR activation in response to nerve impulses. Such a reduction can occur either by nAChRs closing abnormally rapidly, which is observed at the single-channel level as briefer channel openings, or by channels showing impaired opening, which is observed as reduced frequency of openings and prolonged duration of closed periods. It has been shown that most fast-channel mutations inhibit receptor activation by both mechanisms (33Engel A.G. Sine S.M. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2005; 5: 308-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As the C. elegans unc-63(x26) strain mimics the molecular features reported for human FCCMS (reduced open probability and rapid channel closing), this strain may be a candidate in vivo invertebrate model for this type of CMS.Mutations in the Cys-loop of human AChRs have been found to be associated with CMS. In one case, the mutation was in the position equivalent to C151Y, albeit in the ϵ-subunit (ϵC128S) (35Milone M. Ohno K. Fukudome T. Shen X.M. Brengman J. Griggs R.C. Engel A.G. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 841: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The ϵC128S mutation is recessive and becomes pathogenic in a patient carrying a mutation in the other allele. Ligand binding studies have shown that the C128S mutant ϵ-subunit is not incorporated into cell-surface nAChRs, thus behaving as a null mutation (35Milone M. Ohno K. Fukudome T. Shen X.M. Brengman J. Griggs R.C. Engel A.G. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 841: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Lack of strict functional equivalence between Cys-loops of different nAChR subunits has been reported (36Shen X.M. Ohno K. Tsujino A. Brengman J.M. Gingold M. Sine S.M. Engel A.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); for example, ϵC128S is a null mutation, whereas UNC-63 C151Y is not. Moreover, another mutation within the Cys-loop of the human α-subunit, V132L, has been shown to produce FCCMS. This mutation leads to a 7-fold reduction in the duration of the dominant component of the open time histogram and prolongs closings, similar to our observations with the UNC-63 C151Y mutant (36Shen X.M. Ohno K. Tsujino A. Brengman J.M. Gingold M. Sine S.M. Engel A.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).The acetylcholine esterase inhibitor PB is used to treat patients with FCCMS, commonly in conjunction with the potassium channel blocker 3,4-DAP. C. elegans possesses homologs of both human acetylcholine esterase (37Rand J.B. WormBook The C. elegans Research Community. WormBook, 2007Google Scholar) and potassium channels (38Salkoff L. Wei A.D. Baban B. Butler A. Fawcett G. Ferreira G. Santi C.M. WormBook The C. elegans Research Community. WormBook, 2005Google Scholar), and we have shown that the uncoordinated phenotype of unc-63(x26) mutant worms was partially rescued with PB, 3,4-DAP, or both PB and 3,4-DAP (Fig. 5). All concentrations of 3,4-DAP used resulted in partial rescue, whereas with PB, partial rescue was observed at 0.9 and 15.6 mm. These concentrations of PB also increased the thrashing rate of unc-63(x26) worms in a teaching study exploring the classroom use of a C. elegans human disease model (39Kaas B. Vaidya A.R. Leatherman A. Schleidt S. Kohn R.E. Invert Neurosci. 2010; 10: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The statistical power analysis of the thrashing rates of unc-63(x26) worms in PB was calculated to be ∼30% (Decision Support Systems). Thus, our assay may have missed subtle yet real effects of PB at concentrations between 0.9 and 15.6 mm.The availability of a fully sequenced genome (40Elegans C. Science. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3570) Google Scholar) in which 60% of the genes have vertebrate counterparts (41Harris T.W. Chen N. Cunningham F. Tello-Ruiz M. Antoshechkin I.

Sattelle D.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and is increasingly being used in disease-oriented drug screens (42Ségalat L. ACS Chem. Biol. 2007; 2: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 43Artal-Sanz M. de Jong L. Tavernarakis N. Biotechnol. J. 2006; 1: 1405-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The finding that drugs used to treat FCCMS also reduce the muscle deficiency of unc-63(x26) worms highlights the potential of using this mutant strain in whole-organism high-throughput in vivo screens for new therapeutic treatments for human CMS.In conclusion, we have shown that a mutation at the Cys-loop of the C. elegans muscle AChR impairs channel function, giving rise to phenotypic changes that resemble, to a certain degree, those found in human diseases. We therefore propose that the C. elegans unc-63(x26) allele may offer a useful model for developing therapies for CMS.

With much of the machinery required for neuromuscular transmission in mammals conserved in C. elegans, the nematode has emerged as a useful model organism for studying neuromuscular diseases and drug testing (17Francis M.M.

The unc-63(x26) worm containing the mutant L-nAChR has uncoordinated locomotion due presumably to deficient cholinergic signaling at the neuromuscular junction. Here, we show that this phenotype is partially rescued by drugs used to treat humans for fast-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (FCCMS) by enhancing neuromuscular transmission. The fact that both molecular and phenotypic changes produced by a mutation at a key site of a muscle C. elegans nAChR parallel those observed in humans allows us to propose that the unc-63(x26) strain may permit screening for drugs aimed at alleviating the symptoms of diseases arising from mutations of muscle nAChRs."
https://openalex.org/W2037298030,"Ferrochelatase catalyzes the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin IX to form heme. The severe metal ion substrate inhibition observed during in vitro studies of the purified enzyme is almost completely eliminated by mutation of an active site histidine residue (His-287, murine ferrochelatase numbering) to leucine and reduced over 2 orders of magnitude by mutation of a nearby conserved phenylalanine residue (Phe-283) to leucine. Elimination of substrate inhibition had no effect on the apparent V(max) for Ni(2+), but the apparent K(m) was increased 100-fold, indicating that the integrity of the inhibitory binding site is important for the enzyme to turn over substrates rapidly at low micromolar metal ion concentrations. The inhibitory site was observed to have a pK(a) value of 8.0, and this value was reduced to 7.5 by the F283L mutation and to 7.4 in a naturally occurring positional variant observed in most bacterial ferrochelatases, murine ferrochelatase H287C. A H287N variant was also found to be substrate-inhibited, but unlike the H287C variant, pH dependence of substrate inhibition was largely eliminated. The data indicate that the inhibitory metal ion-binding site is composed of multiple residues but primarily defined by His-287 and Phe-283 and is crucial for optimal activity at low metal ion concentrations. It is proposed that this binding site may be important for ferrous iron acquisition and desolvation in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1983523378,"We have shown previously that perfluorocarbon-exposed sonicated dextrose albumin (PESDA) microbubbles bind to injured vascular tissue and can be detected with ultrasound imaging techniques. Prior studies have shown that scavenger receptors (SRs) are regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses and are involved in the progression of vascular disease such as atherosclerosis. In this study, we sought to determine the molecular mechanism of PESDA binding to balloon-injured vasculature. RT-PCR analysis of angioplastied aortas demonstrated a significantly (p ≤ 0.01) increased expression of SRs. Binding to SRs was confirmed using SR-expressing CHO cells, and this binding was blocked by competitive inhibition with the SR-binding ligands oxidized LDL and malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde-modified LDL. Confocal imaging confirmed the co-localization of PESDA microbubbles to CD36, SRB-1, and Toll-like receptor 4, but not to monocytes/macrophages. This study demonstrates that PESDA binds to SRs and that this binding is in major part dependent upon the oxidized nature of PESDA microbubble shell proteins. The extent of SR mRNA expression was increased with injury and associated with microbubble retention as defined by scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. These findings clarify the mechanisms of how albumin-based microbubbles bind to injured and inflamed vasculature and further support the potential of this imaging technique to detect early vascular innate inflammatory pathophysiologic processes."

In Dictyostelium discoideum, adenylate cyclase R (ACR), is essential for spore encapsulation. In addition to its cyclase (AC) domain, ACR harbors seven transmembrane helices, a histidine kinase domain, and two receiver domains. We investigated the role of these domains in the regulation of AC activity. Expression of an ACR-YFP fusion protein in acr− cells rescued their sporulation defective phenotype and revealed that ACR is associated with the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum. Loss of the transmembrane helices (ΔTM) caused a 60% reduction of AC activity, but ΔTM-ACR still rescued the acr− phenotype. The isolated AC domain was properly expressed but inactive. Mutation of three essential ATP-binding residues in the histidine kinase domain did not affect the AC activity or phenotypic rescue. Mutation of the essential phosphoryl-accepting aspartate in receivers 1, 2, or both had only modest effects on AC activity and did not affect phenotypic rescue, indicating that AC activity is not critically regulated by phosphorelay. Remarkably, the dimerizing histidine phosphoacceptor subdomain, which in ACR lacks the canonical histidine for autophosphorylation, was essential for AC activity. Transformation of wild-type cells with an ACR allele (ΔCRA) that is truncated after this domain inhibited AC activity of endogenous ACR and replicated the acr− phenotype. Combined with the observation that the isolated AC domain was inactive, the dominant-negative effect of ΔCRA strongly suggests that the defunct phosphoacceptor domain acquired a novel role in enforcing dimerization of the AC domain.

The ATP derivative cAMP is the most deeply conserved signaling intermediate in all domains of life. In eukaryotes, cAMP is produced by the conserved class III cyclase domain, whereas prokaryotes use five more unrelated catalysts. The class III domain can be subdivided into four subtypes, a–d, with type IIId, which is found in fungi and Euglenozoa, being derived from type IIIc, which is common to both bacteria and Archaea (1.Linder J.U.

In metazoa, it is present as two asymmetrical copies alternating with two sets of six transmembrane (TM) 2The abbreviations used are: TMtransmembraneACadenylate cyclaseRreceiver/response regulatorYFPyellow fluorescent proteinfforwardrreverse. helices in the G-protein-regulated adenylate cyclases and as a single copy in the guanylyl cyclases. Type IIIb domains are very abundant in prokaryotes, where they are typically combined with many other functional domains but are also found in alveolates, Amoebozoa, and mammals. Some of the alveolate enzymes harbor an additional set of six TM helices, whereas others and the mammalian enzyme are soluble proteins (3.Baker D.A. Kelly J.M.

Social amoebas use cAMP not only as a second messenger for external stimuli but also as a secreted primary signal. In this role, cAMP coordinates the aggregation of starving amoeba and the construction of fruiting bodies, and it also triggers the expression of aggregation genes and prespore genes. As second messenger, cAMP mediates the effect of a range of stimuli that control initiation of multicellular development, maturation of stalk and spore cells, and germination of the spores (7.Aubry L.

Cell Motil. 2002; 23: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Comparative analysis of cAMP signaling throughout the social amoebas showed that the roles of cAMP in spore formation and germination are evolutionary derived from a deeply conserved role in the encystation of solitary amoebas (2.Ritchie A.V. van Es S.

Encystation is of considerable medical relevance because cysts are resistant to biocides and immune clearance and preclude effective treatment of diseases by protozoan pathogens (10.Turner N.A.

The mechanisms of encystation are little understood, and an understanding of the role of cAMP in this process will have important therapeutic consequences. The type IIIb enzyme ACR/ACB (5.Kim H.J.

Adenylate cyclase A mainly produces cAMP for secretion and coordination of cell movement (13.Pitt G.S. Milona N. Borleis J. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N.

ACR is a large multidomain protein in which the cyclase catalytic domain is preceded by two receiver domains, a histine kinase region, consisting of a HisKA (histidine kinase phosphoacceptor domain) and HATPase (histidine kinase-, DNA gyrase B-, and phytochrome-like ATPases) C domain and seven TM helices (6.Söderbom F. Anjard C. Iranfar N. Fuller D. Loomis W.F. Development. 1999; 126: 5463-5471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ACR activity is present during growth, decreases during aggregation, and increases again after aggregation to reach maximum levels during fruiting body formation (17.Meima M.E. Schaap P. Dev. Biol. 1999; 212: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Until now, it was not known whether and how the histidine kinase and receiver domains of ACR regulate its cyclase activity. More information is available on the type IIIb cyclase CyaC from the cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis. Like ACR, CyaC also contains a histidine kinase and receiver domain proximal to the carboxyl-terminal AC domain but additionally contains two, more distal GAF (found in cGMP-phosphodiesterases, adenylyl cyclases and formate hydrogen lyase transcriptional activator) domains and a second N-terminal receiver domain. Here, cyclase activity is activated by phosphorylation of the proximal receiver domain by the intrinsic histidine kinase activity (18.Kasahara M. Ohmori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15167-15172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In another cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp., cyclase activity is up-regulated by phosphorylation of the N-terminal receiver domain in response to far-red light via the phytochrome-like sensor histidine kinase AphC (19.Okamoto S. Kasahara M. Kamiya A. Nakahira Y. Ohmori M. Photochem. Photobiol. 2004; 80: 429-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In theory, ACR could also be regulated by any of the 15-sensor histidine kinases that are present in Dictyostelium (20.Anjard C. Loomis W.F. Kuspa A. Dictyostelium Genomics. 1st Ed. Horizon Bioscience, Norfolk, United Kingdom2005: 59-82Google Scholar). In this work, we investigated the cellular localization of ACR and the role of its multiple functional domains in the control of AC activity. Our data show a novel role for the HisKA domain in dimerization of the cyclase domain and unusual localization of the enzyme at the cell nucleus. D. discoideum NC4A2 (21.Shelden E. Knecht D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and acr− cells (see below) were cultured in HL5 medium that was supplemented with 5 μg/ml blasticidin for null mutants and with 10 to 100 μg/ml G418 for cells harboring expression constructs. D. discoideum NC4 was grown in association with Klebsiella aerogenes on standard medium agar. Multicellular development was induced by incubating cells, freed from bacteria or growth medium, at 22 °C on phosphate buffered agar (1.5% agar in 10 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5) at 1.5 × 106 cells/cm2. To generate an AcrA knock-out construct with recyclable selection marker, nucleotides 350–1382 (KO1) and nucleotides 1638–2685 (KO2) of the AcrA-coding region were amplified by PCR from AX2 genomic DNA with primer pairs KO1f/KO1r and KO2f/KO2r, that harbor a KpnI/SalI and BamHI/NotI restriction site, respectively (supplemental Table S1). The KO1 and KO2 fragments were inserted by T/A cloning into vector pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen), released by KpnI/SalI or BamHI/NotI digestion, and cloned into KpnI/SalI and BamHI/NotI sites that flank the floxed A15::Bsr selection cassette of vector pLPBLP (22.Faix J. Kreppel L. Shaulsky G. Schleicher M. Kimmel A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e143Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) generating pACR-KO (supplemental Fig. S1A). NC4A2 cells were transformed with pACR-KO KpnI/NotI insert by electroporation, selected for growth at 5 μg/ml blasticidin, and cloned out on Klebsiella aerogenes lawns. Clonal isolates were tested for gene disruption by two PCR reactions using primer pairs KO1f/KOt1 and BsrF/KOt2 (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. S1A) and examination of genomic digests by Southern blot. The complete 6372-nucleotide ACR cDNA was cloned by a stepwise approach in which the sequence was divided into four segments, which were amplified and assembled sequentially. The first segment AB (containing the single intron position of ACR) was amplified with primers A and B (supplemental Table S1) by reverse transcription PCR of mRNA isolated from 12 h-starved AX2 cells. Segments CD, EF, and GH were all amplified from AX2 genomic DNA by PCR using primer sets C/D, E/F, and G/H for the three segments, respectively (supplemental Table S1). The primers contained restriction sites that were either already present in the ACR sequence or were introduced by neutral mutations. The four segments were individually cloned into pCR4-TOPO, sequenced to validate correct amplification, and released by their respective pairs of restriction enzymes. The segments were then inserted into pGEM-7Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI) step by step at their corresponding restriction sites, as outlined in supplemental Fig. S1B. Next, the full-length ACR cDNA was excised with BamHI and XhoI and inserted into the BamHI/XhoI-digested expression vector pB17S-EYFP. This places ACR under control of the constitutively active A15 promoter and fuses the gene at the C terminus to an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) tag (23.Meima M.E. Biondi R.M. Schaap P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3870-3877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The truncated forms were created by replacing one or several of the four ACR segments (supplemental Fig. S1B) in pGEM-7Zf(+) with a newly amplified truncated version of the relevant region, using a combination of primers ΔT, ΔTK, ΔTKC, ΔTKCR1, and ΔTKCR1R2 (supplemental Table S1) that incorporate a 5′-BamHI site, with reverse primers D or F (supplemental Table S1) for N-terminal truncations, and primer ΔC, with a XhoI site, combined with forward primer G for the C-terminal truncations. The complete truncated ACR cDNA was released from pGEM-7Zf(+) by BamHI/XhoI digestion and inserted into pB17S-EYFP as described above. For the ΔTΔC and ΔTKCR1ΔC double truncations, the ΔT-D and ΔTKCR1-F amplicons were combined with the ΔC construct. The full-length and truncated ACR constructs were transformed into acr− cells by electroporation. Transformants were selected at 10 μg/ml G418, which was gradually increased to 100 μg/ml. Putative dominant-negative fragments were amplified from ACR cDNA using forward primer A and reverse primers ΔCRA and ΔKCRA (supplemental Table S1). After subcloning in pCR4-TOPO, the fragments were inserted into pB17S-EYFP using their BamHI/XhoI restriction sites as described above. Both constructs and empty pB17S-EYFP vector were transformed into wild-type NC4A2 cells, with G418 selection increased to 300 μg/ml. Single or multiple amino acid mutations were introduced by amplifying the entire pCR4-TOPO vector containing the relevant segment of ACR with a mutagenic forward (f) and reverse (r) primer pair. The mutations H613Q, S617A, and S617E of the HRRLS motif in segment AB were performed with primer pairs H613Qf/H613Qr, S617Af/S617Ar and S617Ef/S617Er (supplemental Table S1), respectively. The mutation of three residues in the HATPase-C domain, N769D, D854A, and G856A, were achieved by two PCR reactions with primer pairs N769Df/N769Dr and D854AG856Af/D854AG856Ar on segment CD. Mutations D1010A in the R1 domain and D1089A in the R2 domains were obtained by amplification of segments CD and EF, respectively, with primer pairs D1010Af/D1010Ar and D1089Af/D1089Ar. All mutated segments were validated by DNA sequencing, excised from pCR4-TOPO by their terminal restriction sites, and recombined with the complementary intact ACR segments in pGEM-7ZF(+) to reconstitute the full-length ACR cDNA, as described above. A double D1010A/D1089A mutant was obtained by combining the mutated CD and EF segments with wild-type AB and GH segments (supplemental Fig. S1B). The mutant ACR cDNAs were then inserted into pB17S-EYFP and transformed into acr− cells. Cells transformed with intact or mutant ACR-YFP constructs were harvested during exponential growth, washed once with PB (10 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5) and resuspended in lysis buffer (2 mm MgCl2 and 250 mm sucrose in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) to 108 cells/ml. Cells were lysed by passage through 3-μm pore size nuclepore filters. Aliquots of 10 μl cell lysate were added to 10 μl of 2× assay mix (1 mm ATP, 16 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 20 mm dithiothreitol in lysis buffer). After 5 min of incubation on ice, reactions were started by transferring the samples to a 22 °C water bath. Reactions were terminated after 0, 3, 10, 20, and 30 min by adding 10 μl of 0.4 m EDTA (pH 8.0), followed by boiling for 1 min. cAMP was assayed directly in the boiled lysate by isotope dilution assay (17.Meima M.E. Schaap P. Dev. Biol. 1999; 212: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). AC activities were standardized on the amount of YFP tag in the lysates, determined by quantitative Western blot analysis. Cells were harvested and lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, or filter-lysed cells were mixed with sample buffer. Proteins were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with rabbit polyclonal αGFP antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) For qualitative analysis, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma), and detection was performed with the SuperSignal chemoluminescence kit (Pierce). For quantitative analysis, the secondary antibody was IR dye 800-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen), and signal intensities were analyzed using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Cells were washed with phosphate buffer, left to adhere to coverslips, and fixed with 15% picric acid/paraformaldehyde. Cells were post-fixed with 70% ethanol, washed with PBS (24.Müller-Taubenberger A. Lupas A.N. Li H. Ecke M. Simmeth E. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and were incubated overnight at 8 °C with a polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Abcam), diluted 1:100 in PBSB (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS), and 1:100 diluted monoclonal mouse anti-calnexin antibody (24.Müller-Taubenberger A. Lupas A.N. Li H. Ecke M. Simmeth E. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) to detect ACR-YFP and calnexin, respectively. After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated for 2 h at 22 °C with 1:100 diluted FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Diagnostics Scotland, Edinburgh, Scotland) and 1:500 diluted Alexa Fluor® 594 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) to detect the α-GFP and α-calnexin antibodies, respectively, and simultaneously counterstained with 0.1 μg/ml of the DNA stain DAPI (Invitrogen). Coverslips were washed three times in PBS and mounted to slide glasses with Hydromount (National Diagnostics). To gain initial insight in the functionality of the putative regulatory domains of ACR, we compared their sequences with those of structurally resolved homologous domains. Histidine kinases consist of an HisKA-dimerizing domain that also carries the histidine for autophosphorylation and an ATP binding HATPase-C (HisC) domain. The HisKA domain contains two α-helices, which form an intramolecular dimer with a second HisKA domain, creating a four-helix bundle. Dimerization enables trans-phosphorylation by the HisC domain of two His residues that point outward from two of the four helices. The phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred to the Asp of a receiver (R) domain. The HisKA domain in conjunction with the HisC domain can also act as an R domain-directed phosphatase (25.Hsing W. Russo F.D. Bernd K.K. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Dutta R. Yoshida T. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38645-38653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The ACR HisKA domain contains two adjacent α-helices but lacks the conserved His and other residues that are essential for both autokinase and phosphatase activity (Fig. 1A). Between helix I and the seventh TM domain, ACR harbors another predicted α-helix that contains an HRRLS motif. Apart from a putative His phosphoryl-acceptor, this motif also contains a consensus protein kinase A phosphorylation site (RRxS) (27.Shabb J.B. Chemical reviews. 2001; 101: 2381-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The HisC domain is characterized by five conserved sequence motifs (N, G1, F, G2, and G3) that line the ATP-binding pocket (28.West A.H. Stock A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Alignment of the HisC domain of ACR with structurally resolved HisC domains shows that the residues that define the five motifs are conserved (Fig. 1B). Mutagenesis of the bacterial enzyme CheA showed that residue Asn409 that marks the N motif, residues Asp449 and Gly451 in the G1 motif, and Gly502 in the G2 motif are essential for its kinase activity (29.Hirschman A. Boukhvalova M. VanBruggen R. Wolfe A.J. Stewart R.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13876-13887Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30.Stewart R.C. VanBruggen R. Ellefson D.D. Wolfe A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12269-12279Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For EnvZ, which, unlike CheA, can also act as a receiver-directed phosphatase, mutation of Asn347 (equivalent to Asn409) and Asn343 in the N motif, and Phe390 in the F motif (green highlights) leads to loss of kinase, but not phosphatase activity, whereas mutation of Thr402 in the G2 box (pink highlight) has the opposite effect (25.Hsing W. Russo F.D. Bernd K.K. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Dutta R. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1424-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, most residues required for phosphatase activity reside in the HisKA domain (Fig. 1A). All essential residues for kinase activity are present in ACR, suggesting that its HisC domain could be functional. The ACR HisC domain is however anomalous in harboring a 51-amino acid insertion of low complexity sequence in the first β-sheet. R domains catalyze transfer of a phosphoryl group from a HisKA domain to one of their own Asp residues. They regulate the activities of associated effectors and catalyze autodephosphorylation. Phosphorylation requires association with a Mg2+ ion that is positioned in the conserved active site and commonly causes movement of a conserved Thr or Ser and Tyr or Phe switch residue pair toward the active site.

Alignment of the ACR R domains with two well characterized R domains shows that both the secondary structure elements and the active site residues (bold/underlined) are conserved in ACR_R1 (Fig. 1C). ACR_R2 lacks two of four active site residues and additionally harbors a 112-amino acid insertion. Neither R1 nor R2 contain a complete Thr/Ser-Tyr/Phe switch residue pair (maroon highlight). The phosphoryl-accepting Asp (red text) is conserved in both R1 and R2, but their other anomalies may well interfere with domain functionality. Due to its large size, the 6.4-kb required amplification and cloning ACR cDNA in four segments into pGEM-7Zf(+) followed by subcloning into the extrachromosomal expression vector pB17S-EYFP. In this vector, ACR expression is driven by the constitutive A15 promoter, and the gene is fused at the C terminus to an enhanced YFP tag. The empty vector (YFP) and the ACR-YFP construct were expressed in an acr− mutant. As shown previously (6.Söderbom F. Anjard C. Iranfar N. Fuller D. Loomis W.F. Development. 1999; 126: 5463-5471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), acr− cells develop normally up to the fruiting body stage but are then defective in spore encapsulation, whereas they also form stalks that are thinner than those of wild-type cells. Both aspects of the acr− phenotype were restored by transformation with the ACR-YFP construct but not with the empty vector (Fig. 2A). Inspection of the cells by confocal microscopy showed that YFP-tagged ACR was associated with the nuclear envelope and a vesicular network throughout the cell (Fig. 2B). Incubation of fixed acr−/ACR-YFP cells with antibodies raised against GFP/YFP and the endoplasmic reticulum marker calnexin (24.Müller-Taubenberger A. Lupas A.N. Li H. Ecke M. Simmeth E. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) showed colocalization of ACR-YFP and calnexin around the nuclei and the vesicular network (Fig. 3). This strongly suggests that ACR localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. Western blots of fractionated acr−/ACR-YFP cell lysates, probed with YFP antibodies, confirmed that ACR-YFP is expressed at the expected size of 270 kDa in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 2C). The ΔT ACR-YFP mutant, which lacks the transmembrane domains (Fig. 4) was present predominantly in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 2C) and showed a similar localization as YFP alone over the entire cytoplasm of the cell (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 3Visualization of ACR-YFP and calnexin by immunofluorescence. Axenically grown acr−/ACR-YFP cells were harvested in exponential phase and triple stained with (i) a polyclonal rabbit-anti-GFP antibody, followed by FITC conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG; (ii) a monoclonal mouse-anti-calnexin antibody (24.Müller-Taubenberger A. Lupas A.N. Li H. Ecke M. Simmeth E. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) followed by Alexa Fluor® 594 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG; and (iii) DAPI to detect ACR-YFP, calnexin, and DNA, respectively. Cells were photographed through the UV, TRITC, and FITC filter sets of a Leica DMLB2 fluorescence microscope. The merged image was prepared with the Qcapture Pro camera software.

Truncated segments of the ACR cDNA lacking transmembrane (T, vertical bars), HisKA (K), HisC (C), receiver (R1 and R2) domains or the C-terminal low complexity region (L) were prepared by PCR amplification and recombined with unaltered segments in pGEM7ZF+ to reconstitute the entire (but truncated) cDNAs, which were then transferred to vector pB17S-EYFP and transformed into acr− cells. B, AC activity of truncated proteins. Lysates of transformed cell lines were incubated with AC assay mix for 30 min and assayed for cAMP production. Data are standardized on the amount of YFP fusion protein in the lysates as determined by quantitative Western blotting (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results represent means and S.D. of four experiments performed on cells from at least two separate transformations. C, complementation of acr− phenotype. All transformants were developed into fruiting bodies, which were examined as described for Fig. 2A for complementation of the spore encapsulation (Sp) and thin stalk (St) phenotype. D, expression levels of truncated proteins. Lysates of 3 × 105 cells that had been transformed with intact and truncated ACR-YFP fusion constructs were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The YFP-fusion proteins were visualized by qualitative Western blotting using an α-GFP antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ACR activity can be measured in cell lysates with Mg2+-ATP as a substrate and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and DTT present to inhibit the phosphodiesterases RegA and PdsA, respectively. The other D. discoideum adenylate cyclases adenylate cyclase G and adenylate cyclase A are only expressed to low levels in vegetative cells and require Mn2+ and/or Mg2+ plus GTPγS, respectively, to be assayed in cell lysates (17.Meima M.E. Schaap P. Dev. Biol. 1999; 212: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Consequently, acr−/YFP lysates show very little cAMP accumulation, whereas acr−/ACR-YFP lysates produce cAMP at a steady rate of 1.3 pmol/min mg"
