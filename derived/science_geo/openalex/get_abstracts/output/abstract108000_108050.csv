https://openalex.org/W2013617213,"Synaptic vesicles are proposed to dock at the presynaptic plasma membrane through the interaction of two integral membrane proteins of synaptic vesicles, VAMP and synaptotagmin, and two plasma membrane proteins, syntaxin and SNAP-25. We have characterized the binding properties of these proteins and observed SNAP-25 potentiation of VAMP 2 binding to syntaxins 1a and 4 but not syntaxins 2 or 3. n-sec1, a neuron-specific syntaxin-binding protein, bound syntaxin with nanomolar affinity, forming a complex that is distinct from the previously identified 7S and 20S syntaxin-containing complexes. This suggests that syntaxin exists in at least three states: bound to n-sec1, in a 7S particle, and in a 20S particle. Recombinant n-sec1 inhibited VAMP or SNAP-25 binding to syntaxin. We propose that the specific associations of VAMP, SNAP-25, and syntaxin mediate vesicle docking and that a syntaxin/n-sec1 complex precedes and/or regulates formation of these complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2019297438,"In vitro studies have suggested that the NMDA receptor consists of an essential subunit, NR1, and various modulatory NR2 subunits. To test this hypothesis directly in vivo, we generated mice carrying a disrupted NR1 allele. NMDA-inducible increases in intracellular calcium and membrane currents were abolished in neurons from homozygous null mutants (NR1-/-). Thus, NR1 has a unique role, which cannot be substituted by any other subunit, in determining the activity of the endogenous NMDA receptor. A concomitant reduction in levels of NR2B but not NR2A occurred in NR1-/- mice, demonstrating that there is an interdependence of subunit expression. NR1-/- mice died 8-15 hr after birth, indicating a vital neonatal function for the NMDA receptor. Although the NMDA receptor has been implicated in several aspects of neurodevelopment, overall neuroanatomy of NR1-/- mice appeared normal. Pathological evidence suggested that respiratory failure was the ultimate cause of death."

https://openalex.org/W2004836530,"We have used a replication-incompetent retrovirus to analyze the lineage of olfactory receptor neurons in young rats. At 5-40 days after infection, clusters of infected cells comprised two major types: one consisted of 1-2 horizontal basal cells, and a second consisted of variable numbers of globose basal cells and immature and mature sensory neurons. Olfactory nerve lesion (which enhances neuronal turnover) increased the frequency of the globose-sensory neuron clusters as well as the number of cells in such clusters. No clusters contained both horizontal and globose basal cells, and none contained sustentacular cells. These data suggest, at least in young rats, that horizontal basal cells are not precursors of olfactory neurons, that there is a lineage path from globose cells to mature neurons, and that sustentacular cells may arise from a separate lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2002418745,"We show that uptake and release of the styryl dye FM1-43 may be used to monitor synaptic vesicle exocytosis and recycling at Drosophila larval neuromuscular junctions. At Drosophila nerve terminals, FM1-43 specifically labels subsynaptic domains enriched in synaptotagmin, in a manner that requires Ca2+, membrane depolarization, and shibire (shi) function. Endocytosis rates, very low in unstimulated synapses, are induced severalfold by the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Using shi(ts)1 mutant synapses to separate synaptic vesicle fusion and recycling temporally, we show that recycling events subsequent to the shi block do not require extracellular Ca2+. We suggest that two distinct intermediate stages in vesicle recycling may be trapped and analyzed at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions."

https://openalex.org/W1968859894,"Through a systematic genetic screen, we have identified 55 mutations that affect the development of the PNS of Drosophila embryos. These mutations specify 13 novel and 5 previously characterized genes and define new phenotypes for 2 other known genes. Five classes of mutant phenotypes were identified in the screen: gain of neurons, loss of neurons, abnormal position of chordotonal neurons, aberrant neuronal trajectories, and abnormal morphology of neurons. Phenotypic analyses of mutations identified in this study revealed three novel aspects of PNS development. First, we have identified a novel gene that may be required to define glial versus neuronal cell identity. Second, our data indicate that neuronal migration plays an important role in pattern formation in the embryonic PNS. Third, we have identified mutations that cause a lack of sensory organs, but unlike mutations in proneural genes, do not affect the formation of sensory organ precursors. These genes may be required for key aspects of neuronal differentiation. Our studies suggest that approximately 70 essential genes are required for proper PNS development in Drosophila embryos."
