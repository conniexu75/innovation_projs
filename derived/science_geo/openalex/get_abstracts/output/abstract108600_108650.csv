https://openalex.org/W2063950143,"Quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction (QC-PCR) methods were used to quantify virion-associated human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) RNA in plasma from 66 patients with Centers for Disease Control stage I to IVC1 infection. HIV-1 RNA, ranging from 100 to nearly 22,000,000 copies per milliliter of plasma (corresponding to 50 to 11,000,000 virions per milliliter), was readily quantified in all subjects, was significantly associated with disease stage and CD4+ T cell counts, and decreased by as much as 235-fold with resolution of primary infection or institution of antiretroviral therapy. Plasma virus levels determined by QC-PCR correlated with, but exceeded by an average of 60,000-fold, virus titers measured by endpoint dilution culture. Quantitation of HIV-1 in plasma by QC-PCR may be useful in assessing the efficacy of antiretroviral agents, especially in early stage disease when conventional viral markers are often negative."
https://openalex.org/W1489775551,"We have replaced the C-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (residues 266-272) with the homologous region of the alpha 1B-adrenergic receptor. In a fashion analogous to the reciprocal mutations of the alpha 1B receptor previously described (Cotecchia, S., Exum, S., Caron, M. G., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 2896-2900), this conservative substitution leads to agonist-independent activation of adenylyl cyclase. In addition, the constitutively active mutant receptor exhibits: (i) an increased affinity for agonists (even in the absence of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein)) but not antagonists, with the extent of affinity increase being correlated with the intrinsic activity of the ligand; (ii) an increased potency of agonists for stimulation of adenylyl cyclase; and (iii) an increased intrinsic activity of partial agonists. We document that our experimental findings with the mutant receptor cannot be adequately rationalized within the theoretical framework of the Ternary Complex Model (De Lean, A., Stadel, J. M., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 7108-7117) which postulates that receptor activation requires the agonist-promoted formation of an active, ternary complex of agonist, receptor, and G protein. We show, through extensive computer simulations, that an extended version of this model that includes an explicit isomerization of the receptor (R) to an active state (R*) closely models all our findings for both the mutant and the wild-type receptors. Study of such constitutively active mutant G protein-coupled receptors should help elucidate the molecular nature of the processes involved in receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W2051831012,"The eukaryotic transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) participates in many parts of the genetic program mediating T lymphocyte activation and growth. Nuclear expression of NF-κB occurs after its induced dissociation from its cytoplasmic inhibitor IκBα. Phorbol ester and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induction of nuclear NF-κB is associated with both the degradation of performed IκBα and the activation of IκBα gene expression. Transfection studies indicate that the IκBα gene is specifically induced by the 65-kilodalton transactivating subunit of NF-κB. Association of the newly synthesized IκBα with p65 restores intracellular inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding activity and prolongs the survival of this labile inhibitor. Together, these results show that NF-κB controls the expression of IκBα by means of an inducible autoregulatory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1967463041,"Calcium ions (Ca2+) act as an intracellular second messenger and can enter neurons through various ion channels. Influx of Ca2+ through distinct types of Ca2+ channels may differentially activate biochemical processes. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and L-type Ca2+ channels, two major sites of Ca2+ entry into hippocampal neurons, were found to transmit signals to the nucleus and regulated gene transcription through two distinct Ca2+ signaling pathways. Activation of the multifunctional Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) was evoked by stimulation of either NMDA receptors or L-type Ca2+ channels; however, activation of CaM kinase appeared to be critical only for propagating the L-type Ca2+ channel signal to the nucleus. Also, the NMDA receptor and L-type Ca2+ channel pathways activated transcription by means of different cis-acting regulatory elements in the c-fos promoter. These results indicate that Ca2+, depending on its mode of entry into neurons, can activate two distinct signaling pathways. Differential signal processing may provide a mechanism by which Ca2+ controls diverse cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W2074683128,"The N-methy -D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of the glutamate receptor is essential for neuronal differentiation and establishment or elimination of synapses in a developing brain. The activity of the NMDA receptor has now been shown to also regulate the migration of granule cells in slice preparations of the developing mouse cerebellum. First, blockade of NMDA receptors by specific antagonists resulted in the curtailment of cell migration. Second, enhancement of NMDA receptor activity by the removal of magnesium or by the application of glycine increased the rate of cell movement. Third, increase of endogenous extracellular glutamate by inhibition of its uptake accelerated the rate of cell migration. These results suggest that NMDA receptors may play an early role in the regulation of calcium-dependent cell migration before neurons reach their targets and form synaptic contacts."

https://openalex.org/W1998448534,"Mammalian circadian rhythms are regulated by a pacemaker within the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The molecular mechanisms controlling the synchronization of the circadian pacemaker are unknown; however, immediate early gene (IEG) expression in the SCN is tightly correlated with entrainment of SCN-regulated rhythms. Antibodies were isolated that recognize the activated, phosphorylated form of the transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB). Within minutes after exposure of hamsters to light, CREB in the SCN became phosphorylated on the transcriptional regulatory site, Ser133. CREB phosphorylation was dependent on circadian time: CREB became phosphorylated only at times during the circadian cycle when light induced IEG expression and caused phase shifts of circadian rhythms. These results implicate CREB in neuronal signaling in the hypothalamus and suggest that circadian clock gating of light-regulated molecular responses in the SCN occurs upstream of phosphorylation of CREB."

https://openalex.org/W2013293473,"To identify genes involved in vascular disease, we investigated patients with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), an inherited vascular disorder that causes hemodynamically significant narrowing of large elastic arteries. Pulsed-field gel and Southern analyses showed that a translocation near the elastin gene cosegregated with SVAS in one family. DNA sequence analyses demonstrated that the translocation disrupted the elastin gene and localized the breakpoint to exon 28. Taken together with our previous study linking SVAS to the elastin gene in two additional families and existing knowledge of vascular biology, these data suggest that mutations in the elastin gene can cause SVAS."
https://openalex.org/W1599437019,"The myeloid integrin CD11b is expressed selectively on the surface of mature monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, and natural killer cells. Tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression of CD11b is controlled at the level of mRNA transcription, and recent characterization of the human CD11b promoter indicates that the first 92 bp of 5'-flanking DNA are sufficient to direct tissue-specific expression of a reporter gene. Here we show that the sequence AAAAGGAGAAG at base pair -20 of the CD11b promoter binds the proto-oncogene PU.1 in vitro and that mutation of this site significantly reduces the ability of the CD11b promoter to direct expression of a reporter gene in myeloid cells but not in nonmyeloid cells. PU.1 may thus represent a major determinant of the myeloid expression of CD11b."
https://openalex.org/W80727568,"A multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CR1R12) was obtained which constitutively expresses P-glycoprotein, up to 32% by weight of plasma membrane protein. CR1R12 plasma membranes had high, drug-activated ATPase activity referable to P-glycoprotein. The specific ATPase activity in the presence of verapamil was calculated to be approximately 9 mumol/min/mg (identical to 21 s-1) at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4. KM ATP was 1.4 mM, and ADP and 5'-adenylyl imidodiphosphate were competitive inhibitors with Ki values 0.35 and 0.44 mM, respectively. 2'-dATP was a good substrate, GTP and ITP were real but poor substrates, and ADP and AMP were not hydrolyzed. Optimal pH for ATP hydrolysis was 7.3. MgATP was the preferred substrate, and CaATP was hydrolyzed very weakly. 7-Chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl) covalently labeled the P-glycoprotein, and incorporation of 1.1 mol of NBD-Cl/mol of P-glycoprotein gave 100% inactivation. ATP protected against NBD-Cl inactivation. N-Ethylmaleimide was a potent inhibitor in the absence of ATP, and in its presence significant protection from inhibition could be achieved. Vanadate and fluoroaluminate were also strong inhibitors. The plasma membranes from CR1R12 cells should provide material for purification and reconstitution of P-glycoprotein and for screening of potential multidrug-reversal reagents by enzymic assay."
https://openalex.org/W1647833960,"P-glycoproteins are heavily glycosylated plasma membrane proteins, which confer multidrug resistance by pumping a range of different drugs from the cell. To investigate the significance of the conserved N-glycosylation sites present in the putative first extracellular loop of P-glycoproteins, we mutated one, two, or all three of these sites present in the human MDR1 P-glycoprotein. We also deleted a stretch of 20 amino acids, containing two of the three N-glycosylation sites. The effects of these mutations were studied by transfection into drug-sensitive cells. In vincristine-resistant transfected clones selected for similar steady state levels of membrane-bound P-glycoprotein, the absence of N-glycosylation did not alter the level or pattern of (cross-)resistance. However, the absence of N-glycosylation sites drastically reduced the efficiency with which drug-resistant clones could be generated. These findings suggest that N-glycosylation contributes to proper routing or stability of P-glycoprotein but not to drug transport per se. The deletion mutants demonstrated a clearly decreased and altered drug resistance pattern, even with a high level of P-glycoprotein in the plasma membrane. This, and possibly the observed lack of glycosylation of the remaining intact glycosylation sequence, suggests a constrained P-glycoprotein structure. Our findings support the current model for P-glycoprotein structure."

https://openalex.org/W1681307511,"Phosphorylation of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) by protein kinase C occurs on apparently the same sites in vitro and in intact cells (in situ) and is implicated in modulation of Pgp function. The region of the molecule which contains the in vitro phosphorylation sites and two specific sites within this region are now determined by peptide sequencing. Membrane vesicles from multidrug-resistant human KB-V1 cells were incubated with purified protein kinase C and [gamma-32P]ATP, and Pgp (containing 1 mol of phosphate/mol of protein) was purified to apparent homogeneity. Phosphorylation occurred exclusively on serine residues. Phosphopeptides were generated by digestion with Lys-C endoproteinase or trypsin, partially purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and further purified with strategies developed for individual phosphopeptides. Sequence analysis by Edman degradation and comparison with the deduced amino acid sequence of human (mdr 1) Pgp identified serines 661 and 671, and one or more of serines 667, 675, and 683, as sites of phosphorylation. These sites are clustered in the linker region located between the two homologous halves of Pgp. Our results identify a previously undefined, phosphorylatable domain of Pgp, smaller in size but analogous in location to the R-domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. These data provide a basis for a better understanding of the role of phosphorylation in the mechanism of action and regulation of this important multidrug pump protein."
https://openalex.org/W1561829393,"We have studied the transmembrane topology of human P-glycoprotein (MDR1) using protein chimeras in Xenopus oocytes and full-length native protein in a cell-free translation system. We find both in vivo and in vitro, that the peptide region between putative transmembrane helices (TM) 8 and 9 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen not in the cytosol as predicted. The topology of the carboxyl-terminal half of MDR1 therefore appears distinct from the homologous amino-terminal half in which the corresponding region between TM2 and TM3 is cytosolic. Thus, topogenic sequences encoded in the homologous amino and carboxyl domains of MDR1 direct fundamentally different events in biogenesis of the two halves of MDR1. We conclude that the transmembrane topology of MDR1, an important member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, is not as predicted and should be revised."
https://openalex.org/W1504778553,"When microtubules, ordinarily quite rigid structures, are treated in vitro with the anti-tumor drug taxol, they rapidly develop a wavy appearance and become strikingly flexible. A quantitative measure of their flexibility, the reciprocal statistical length, lambda, increases by an order of magnitude when taxol is bound. Subsequent addition of either of the microtubule-associated proteins MAP-2 or tau causes the flexibility to disappear. It can be restored again by removing the microtubule-associated protein. These results show that taxol changes microtubular structure substantially, probably by weakening the interactions between protofilaments, and that microtubule-associated proteins reverse these effects, possibly by bridging protofilaments. This structural change and the accompanying flexibility may contribute importantly to taxol's cytotoxic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1033010459,"The beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) specifically phosphorylates the activated form of multiple receptors such as the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2 AR) and rhodopsin. beta ARK also phosphorylates synthetic peptides, albeit with an approximately 10(4)-10(7)-fold lower Vmax/Km ratio as compared to receptors, with a clear preference for peptides containing acidic residues on the aminoterminal side of a serine or threonine. To further characterize the mechanism of substrate phosphorylation by beta ARK, we designed a series of analogue peptides containing a single amino acid change (serine, glutamic acid, or phosphoserine) situated 2 or 4 residues amino-terminal to the target serine. While beta ARK weakly phosphorylated peptides lacking an acidic residue, peptides containing either a single phosphoserine or glutamic acid were substantially better substrates with a 3.5- to 8-fold increase in Vmax. Additional studies demonstrated that the interaction of beta ARK with an activated receptor (beta 2AR* or Rho*) also significantly enhanced peptide phosphorylation. Both Rho* and a truncated rhodopsin lacking its carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites activated peptide phosphorylation to a similar extent with EC50 values for activation of 0.65 and 1.34 microM, respectively. In contrast, the agonist-occupied beta 2AR activated peptide phosphorylation by beta ARK with a substantially higher affinity (EC50 of 0.012 microM) compared to Rho*. The Vmax/Km ratio for beta ARK phosphorylation of a poor peptide substrate such as RRRASAAASAA was increased up to approximately 200-fold by the activated receptor while the phosphorylation of a good peptide substrate (RRREEEEESAAA) was increased only up to approximately 8-fold. Our results suggest that acidic residues (glutamic acid or phosphoserine) localized on the amino-terminal side of target serines are important but not essential determinants in directing peptide phosphorylation. The substrate specificity of beta ARK appears to rely more strongly on the overall topological structure of the activated receptor which promotes the specific binding and activation of beta ARK."
https://openalex.org/W2073040276,"Molecular complementation of mutant phenotypes by transgenic technology is a potentially important tool for gene identification. A technology was developed that allows the transfer of a physically intact yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) into the germ line of the mouse. A purified 150-kilobase YAC encompassing the murine gene Col1a1 was efficiently introduced into embryonic stem (ES) cells via lipofection. Chimeric founder mice were derived from two transfected ES cell clones. These chimeras transmitted the full length transgene through the germ line, generating two transgenic mouse strains. Transgene expression was visualized as nascent transcripts in interphase nuclei and quantitated by ribonuclease protection analysis. Both assays indicated that the transgene was expressed at levels comparable to the endogenous collagen gene."
https://openalex.org/W1556824391,"Basal transcription of the human multidrug resistance (mdr1) promoter was studied by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter fusion gene analysis in two parental and doxorubicin-resistant human tumor cell lines. Deletion of mdr1 DNA sequences to -89 relative to the start of transcription (at +1) had little effect on expression. Deletion of nucleotide sequences from -89 to -70, however, resulted in a 5-10-fold reduction in mdrCAT expression. DNase I footprint analysis demonstrated that the region from -85 to -70 was protected from nuclease digestion using nuclear extracts from these cell lines. The sequence between -82 and -73 is perfectly homologous with the 10-base pair Y-box consensus sequence found in the promoters of all major histocompatibility complex class-II (MHC II) genes. The Y-box sequence in MHC II genes is required for accurate and efficient transcription and contains the sequence CCAAT in the reverse orientation (Dorn, A., Durand, B., Marfing, C., Le Meur, M., Benoist, C., and Mathis, D. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 6249-6253). Mutations in the reverse CCAAT sequence of the Y-box consensus substantially reduced expression of an mdrCAT vector and eliminated nucleoprotein binding in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. These results suggest that proteins which bind to the putative Y-box consensus sequence are critical for basal transcriptional regulation of the human mdr1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1552901871,"The natriuretic peptide receptor type A (NPR-A) is a receptor-guanylyl cyclase whose cytoplasmic enzymatic activity is stimulated by atrial natriuretic peptide binding to the extracellular domain. NPR-A expressed in COS cells is heterogeneously glycosylated, and the more highly glycosylated protein is also phosphorylated. Upon hormone binding, dephosphorylation occurs from both serine and threonine residues, probably within the kinase homology domain of NPR-A, and may be involved with receptor desensitization. Using site-specific mutations in the kinase homology domain of NPR-A, we have identified several residues that are important for regulating the guanylyl cyclase activity of NPR-A. Some of these amino acids are probably essential for maintaining the proper tertiary structure of the intracellular domain, and others may form loops that allow for binding of ATP, which is required for proper enzymatic activity. The site-specific mutants which have greatly reduced enzymatic activity are not phosphorylated and are incompletely glycosylated. These results suggest a correlation between phosphorylation and complete glycosylation of NPR-A and that both are required for hormone-induced enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1528514916,"In this study, we have confirmed the ability of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin to modulate drug resistance, as previously observed in CH LZ cells (Thierry et al., Cancer Commun. 1, 311-316, 1989), in two human multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell lines, the breast cancer MCF-7/ADR cell line, and the ovarian carcinoma SKVLB cell line. This effect was specific to MDR cells, as liposomally encapsulated doxorubicin did not enhance cell sensitivity to the drug in the parental cell lines. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that empty liposomes in the presence of free doxorubicin (Dox) reversed resistance to the drug at a level that may be higher than that observed when liposome-encapsulated Dox is used. This effect seems to be due to the high affinity of Dox for cardiolipin, one of the liposome components, which leads to the association of the drug and the cardiolipin-containing liposomes in the culture medium before entry into the cells. Neither pretreatment of empty liposomes before drug treatment nor combined incubation of vincristine and empty liposomes alter MDR in CH LZ cells, suggesting that the drug must be encapsulated or complexed to the liposomes to overcome MDR. Because MDR in CH LZ cells does not seem to be related to GSH level, MDR modulation by liposome-encapsulated Dox apparently may not be effected by altering the GSH function. These results suggest that the enhancement of sensitivity of MDR cells using Dox encapsulated in liposomes or complexed with liposomes may be explained by an increase in cell drug incorporation and by an intracellular drug redistribution. Fluorescence confocal microscopy study indicated that Dox is transported and distributed mainly in intracytoplasmic vesicles in SKVLB and MCF-7/ADR cells, whereas in parental cells the drug is located mainly in the nucleus. In addition, presentation of Dox in liposomes modifies the drug distribution pattern in MDR cells by partially shifting the drug to nuclear compartments. Thus, liposome-associated Dox may bypass the vesicular drug transport in MDR cells, resulting in the enhancement of the drug biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1537520581,"Mammalian prosomatostatin (PSS) is cleaved at a dibasic Arg-Lys site to produce somatostatin-14 (SS-14) and at monobasic Arg and Lys sites to yield SS-28 and PSS(1-10) (antrin), respectively. Furin, PC1, and PC2 are three recently discovered mammalian endoproteases localized either to the constitutive (furin) or regulated (PC1, PC2) secretory pathways. In this study we have compared the heterologous processing of PSS in transiently transfected endocrine (AtT-20 pituitary) and nonendocrine (COS-7 monkey kidney, PC12 pheochromocytoma) tumor cells. We have correlated the efficiency of processing of PSS to SS-14, SS-28, and PSS(1-10) with (i) secretion through the constitutive or regulated pathways; (ii) endogenous expression of mRNA for furin, PC1, and PC2; and (iii) exogenous expression of PC1 and PC2 in cells that do not contain these enzymes in order to delineate the putative role of these enzymes in mediating PSS cleavage at dibasic and monobasic sites and to localize the proteolytic events to specific compartments of the secretory pathways. COS-7 and PC12 cells expressed only furin, secreted constitutively, and processed PSS preferentially at monobasic sites to SS-28 (40-43%) and antrin (27-29%). Processing, however, was inefficient as suggested by large amounts of unprocessed PSS. In contrast, AtT-20 cells showed regulated secretion, expressed all three endoproteases (with high levels of PC1), and processed PSS efficiently to mainly SS-14. PC1, but not PC2, exogenously coexpressed with PSS in COS-7 cells produced significant conversion to SS-14 but not SS-28. This study shows that PSS is capable of monobasic cleavage in the constitutive secretory pathway. Such processing could be mediated by a furin-like enzyme but is relatively inefficient. PC1 can effect dibasic cleavage of PSS whereas PC2 is without influence on PSS processing at least within the constitutive secretory pathway. Although monobasic and dibasic processing of PSS in COS-7 cells correlates with furin-like and PC1 activity, respectively, the relative inefficiency of such processing suggests that compartmentalization of proteolytic events in secretory vesicles or other more specific endoproteases may be required."
https://openalex.org/W2077877485,"Exposure of midgastrulation mouse embryos to retinoic acid induced anteriorized expression of the Hoxa-1 (Hox-1.6) and Hoxb-1 (Hox-2.9) genes. Separate, extra domains of Hoxb-1 expression were detected as stripes and patches up to the midbrain boundary within rhombomeres r3, r2, and r1. Morphological alterations were studied in embryos of the transgenic line L17, which allowed staining of cranial ganglia, motor neurons, and axons by means of the beta-galactosidase reaction. Axons of motor neurons in r3 normally project laterally, before they turn sharply rostrally to exit with the trigeminal nerve from r2. Altered projection patterns were observed for single neurons, groups of neurons, or the complete set of r3 motor neurons in different embryos exposed to retinoic acid. Here r3 axons turned in the opposite direction and exited as facial nerves from r4. These changes of neuroectodermal fates indicate a linkage between axonal pathfinding and intrinsic neuronal specification by Hox codes."
https://openalex.org/W1504406865,"We examined the effect of interleukin-6 (IL-6) on the expression of transglutaminase in human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells. Treatment of cells with IL-6 increased their transglutaminase activity in a time- and dose-dependent way. Dexamethasone strengthened the stimulation by IL-6. Half-maximum stimulation of transglutaminase activity in the cells occurred at a dose of 40 pM IL-6 regardless of the presence of dexamethasone. Based on its immunoreactivity, the transglutaminase induced was identified as tissue-type transglutaminase. Immunoblot analysis showed that the increase in transglutaminase activity was related to an increase in the amount of transglutaminase protein. Northern blot analysis with a cDNA probe specific for human tissue-type transglutaminase showed that exposure of HepG2 cells to IL-6 increased the mRNA level of the enzyme, and the increase was detectable 3 h after IL-6 was added. Induction of the mRNA was maximum between 10 and 14 h. The increase in the mRNA level was not blocked by the presence of cycloheximide, suggesting that the increase was independent of protein synthesis. Injections into mice of substances that induce inflammation such as turpentine and lipopolysaccharides increased the liver transglutaminase activity. These results indicated that transglutaminase may be involved in some biological processes in hepatocytes regulated by IL-6 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1552667297,"By gel filtration of a crude extract of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332 and OKB 105, the multienzyme system that forms the lipoheptapeptide surfactin was separated into three enzyme fractions, E1, E2, and E3. E1, which appeared near the exclusion limit of the column, activates all amino acid components of surfactin as aminoacyladenylates and thioesters according to the thioester mechanism. In addition, a leucine-activating enzyme (E2) and an acyltransferase (E3) were detected that show molecular masses of approximately 160 and 40 kDa, respectively. The surfactin synthetase multienzyme system was reconstituted by complementation of all three enzyme fractions, yielding high rates of lipopeptide formation. E1 is composed of two multifunctional polypeptides (E1A and E1B) with molecular masses of 460 and 435 kDa, respectively, that can be separated by high-resolution anion-exchange chromatography on Pharmacia Mono Q. E1A binds L-Glu and L-Leu in a molar ratio of 1:2, whereas E1B incorporates L-Val, L-Asp, and L-Leu in a molar ratio of 1:1:1. The hydroxy fatty acid moiety is contributed by the acyltransferase accepting the hydroxy fatty acid coenzyme A thioester as substrate. The transfer of the hydroxy fatty acid to E1A and the formation of the hydroxyacyl-L-glutamate intermediate are the initiation steps in the biosynthesis of surfactin. The amino acid-activating enzyme components E1A, E1B, and E2 have been highly purified and partially characterized."

https://openalex.org/W1598400049,"The synapsins are neuronal phosphoproteins that bind to small synaptic vesicles and to actin filaments and are believed to play a regulatory role in neurotransmitter release. Here we show that synapsin I is covalently modified with remarkable affinity and selectivity by the enzyme transglutaminase. Transglutaminase catalyzes the formation of covalent bonds between protein glutamine residues and primary amines and has been found recently to be potently activated by tetanus toxin, a dichain clostridial protein that selectively blocks neurotransmitter secretion. We also report the presence of two species of immunoreactive transglutaminases in nerve endings, one cytosolic and one located on synaptic vesicles; they are potently activated by tetanus toxin and, when activated, covalently modify synaptic vesicle-bound synapsin I. These results suggest a role for transglutaminase in the control of neurotransmitter secretion and provide evidence for synapsin I being a molecular target of tetanus toxin."

A small 5'-exon of the mRNA untranslated region is separated by a 6-kb intron from the second exon. The coding region of the receptor is interrupted by a small intron, containing an in-frame stop codon, shortly after the proposed fifth transmembrane domain. In the 5'-flanking region a potential cAMP-response element and an AP-2 site, in addition to a TATA-like sequence and a typical CAAT, box are present.

https://openalex.org/W1503726497,"P-glycoprotein, the product of the multidrug resistance (mdr) gene family, is a major determinant in the development of resistance to a large number of cancer chemotherapeutic agents and is also expressed normally in a variety of mammalian tissues. In rodents during pregnancy, there is a dramatic overproduction of the mdr1b form of P-glycoprotein at the lumenal surface of the secretory epithelium of the gravid uterus. An expression vector, mdr1b-CAT, was constructed by fusion of this promoter region to a reporter gene, the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. R5020, a progesterone agonist, increased approximately 3-fold the expression of mdr1b-CAT when transfected into T47D cells, a cell line that constitutively expresses the progesterone receptor. A far greater response to R5020 was observed when the cells were co-transfected with an expression vector for the A form of the progesterone receptor, but not the B form. A series of 5'-deleted clones of the mdr1b-CAT construct indicated that the region of responsiveness was located in the first untranslated exon of the gene. Furthermore, sequences from the first exon were able to confer responsiveness to the non-responsive thymidine kinase-CAT vector. This study demonstrates that progesterone specifically regulates the activity of the mdr1b promoter and that this response is directed solely by the A form of the progesterone receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1493593542,"When purified rat liver ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), a trimer of 36 kDa subunits, was denatured in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and then diluted 50-100-fold, no activity was recovered, and the OTC subunits aggregated. In contrast, when the chaperonin groEL was included in the dilution buffer, OTC did not aggregate but instead comigrated in a sucrose density gradient with the groEL oligomer, indicating that a complex had been formed. Upon addition of the cochaperonin groES and ATP to the isolated OTC-groEL complex, OTC monomers were folded, released, and assembled into active trimer. Neither groES nor ATP alone was sufficient to release active OTC from groEL. The extent of recovery of activity was proportional to the concentration of the complex, reaching approximately 80-90% at monomer concentrations above 0.6 microM. At low complex concentrations, kinetic studies revealed an initial lag in the reconstitution reaction, suggesting that assembly is the rate-limiting step under these conditions. We could trap folded, released, inactive OTC monomers at early times that assembled into active trimers with longer incubation. A nonhydrolyzable ATP analog could release bound OTC from groEL in the presence of groES, but the OTC monomers were not competent for assembly. These data show that recovery of OTC activity in vitro can be efficiently directed by the bacterial chaperonins in the presence of ATP and suggest that the mechanism of reconstitution involves ATP and groES-dependent folding and release of OTC monomers from groEL, followed by spontaneous assembly of trimers."

Murine Leydig tumor (MA-10) cells predominantly overexpress GC/ANF-R in high density (Pandey, K. N., Pavlou, S. N., and Inagami, T. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 13406-13413; Pandey, K. N., and Singh, S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 12342-12348). Information regarding the post-binding events of GC/ANF-R is obscure. This study presents the kinetics of internalization, recycling, and redistribution of GC/ANF-R in model MA-10 cells. Both the 125I-ANF binding assays and photoaffinity labeling procedures were utilized to label the total, intracellular, and cell surface GC/ANF-R. After the binding of 125I-ANF to GC/ANF-R, this complex was internalized and both the intact and degraded ligands were released into culture media. The distribution of 125I-ANF on the cell surface, in the intracellular compartments, and into culture media provided a dynamic relationship between the rates of 125I-ANF uptake, its degradation, and extrusion. The extent of receptor recycling was measured using tryptic proteolysis of photoaffinity-labeled GC/ANF-R to distinguish cell surface receptors from those that were internalized. A population of GC/ANF-R rapidly recycled (t1/2 = 5 min) from intracellular compartment to plasma membrane. Recycling of GC/ANF-R was impaired by chloroquine, dinitrophenol, and low temperature (22 degrees C). Furthermore, these studies suggest that dissociation of ANF from the receptor is not required for recycling of internalized GC/ANF-R."
https://openalex.org/W1579202592,"Ribonucleoparticle-independent transport of precursor proteins into mammalian microsomes is stimulated by 70-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsc70) and an additional cytosolic protein. Here we addressed the question of whether other molecular chaperones can replace Hsc70 in facilitating protein transport into the endoplasmic reticulum. Specifically, we asked if members of the same family of stress proteins, i.e. the microsomal protein immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein or the bacterial protein DnaK, can substitute for Hsc70. Furthermore, we investigated whether molecular chaperones with a proven role in protein folding and belonging to the other two major families of stress proteins, i.e. Hsp60 or Hsp90, can substitute for Hsc70. We show that none of these stress proteins was able to substitute for Hsc70 in facilitating protein transport into mammalian microsomes. GroEL (the bacterial member of the Hsp60 family) and Hsp90, however, competed with Hsc70 for binding of the non-native precursor protein. Therefore, we conclude that there are both substrate and functional specificity in the action of molecular chaperones."
https://openalex.org/W1537255763,"To understand how the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the thyrocyte remains flexible to physiologic changes in the load of exportable proteins, we have examined hormonally-induced increments in thyroglobulin (Tg) flux and pool size in the ER, the relationship between kinetics of Tg folding and ER export, and steady-state levels of molecular chaperones. Tg production was increased > or = 5-fold by chronic exposure to thyrotropin (TSH), and > or = 25-fold by exposure to a mixture of TSH, insulin, transferrin, and hydrocortisone (4H). In TSH-grown cells Tg assembly was accelerated, specifically involving early folding intermediates that lead to a compact monomer. Accelerated dissociation of nascent Tg from the binding protein, BiP, was observed in parallel. TSH exposure was accompanied by modest increases in ER chaperones as well as accelerated Tg export from the thyrocyte ER. However, in 4H-grown thyrocytes, although there were further increases in ER chaperones, monomer maturation was slowed and the association between nascent Tg and BiP was prolonged. Nevertheless, export from the ER remained accelerated, indicating that exit from the ER must include other regulated steps that occur after the folding of exportable proteins. Thus, protein folding may not necessarily be the rate-limiting step in the export of newly synthesized proteins from the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1534549571,"The protein product of the neu (proto)oncogene p185neu is an analog of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Immunoblot analyses of cell surface fractions (microvilli) from the ascites 13762 rat mammary adenocarcinoma indicate that these cells contain p185neu but not epidermal growth factor receptor. Phalloidin shift velocity sedimentation analysis indicated that essentially all of the microvillar p185 co-migrated with microvillar microfilament cores when extractions were performed under microfilament-stabilizing conditions. Fractionation studies of these microvilli indicated that the association of p185 with the microfilament core is mediated by its stable interaction with a previously described transmembrane complex (TMC), composed minimally of at least four glycoproteins, a 58-kDa cytoplasmic membrane protein, and actin (Carraway, C. A. C., Jung, G., and Carraway, K. L. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 430-434). A fraction of the p185 co-purifies with a large (> 2 x 10(6) kDa) complex of the TMC glycoproteins on gel filtration of microvilli, microfilament cores, or microvillar membranes in buffer containing 1 M KCl at pH 9.5, which are conditions required for the dissociation of actin from the complex. We propose that p185-containing TMC serves as a signal transduction particle at the surface of the 13762 cells and may be a prototype for similar microfilament-associated signal-transducing complexes in other cells."
https://openalex.org/W1547452419,"Multidrug resistance in mammalian cells is often associated with the overproduction of a membrane glycoprotein, P-glycoprotein, that is encoded by mdr genes. Multidrug resistance cell lines selected with either vinblastine, colchicine, or taxol from the drug-sensitive murine macrophage-like cell line J774.2 overexpress the mdr1a and/or mdr1b genes, and overproduce P-glycoprotein. To elucidate the mechanisms of mdr1b gene expression, the mdr1b 5'-flanking sequences have been isolated from a normal mouse liver genomic library and analyzed by gel shift and DNase I footprinting assays. These analyses have demonstrated three nuclear protein binding sites, from -82 to -59 (site 1), from -123 to -101 (site 2), and from -272 to -249 (site 3), which interact with proteins present in nuclear extracts from both sensitive and resistant cells. Although site 1 contains a partially conserved AP-2 consensus sequence, our results indicate that the nuclear protein binding to site 1 is not AP-2 protein. The sequence of site 2 is conserved in the murine mdr1a, human mdr1, and hamster pgp1 promoters. Such conservation suggests that this sequence may have an important role in mdr gene expression. The use of a transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression vector containing the basal promoter for herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tkCAT) and either site 1 or site 2 or both revealed that the sequences of sites 1 and 2 enhanced tkCAT activity. DNase I footprinting analyses demonstrated that site 3 is recognized by human AP-1 protein, indicating that the nuclear protein binding to this site is an AP-1-like protein. These observations suggest that mdr1b gene expression is mediated by preexisting transcription factors present in sensitive and resistant cells."

https://openalex.org/W1596268728,"Incubation of HeLa cells with the IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors: ribavirin (100 microM, 4 h), tiazofurin (100 microM, 4 h), selenazofurin (100 microM, 4 h), or mycophenolic acid (10 microM, 4 h) resulted in approximately 70% reduction in cellular GTP pools and shifting of nucleophosmin/B23 from nucleoli to nucleoplasm as detected by immunofluorescence (B23-translocation). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot assay showed there is no loss or degradation of nucleophosmin/B23 protein during drug treatment. This translocation effect could be prevented by co-incubation with guanosine (100 microM) or reversed by addition of guanosine (100 microM) to the culture medium after B23-translocation had been induced by these inhibitors. Under these conditions of guanosine supplementation, cellular GTP pool concentrations were maintained at the control level. These results indicate that localization of nucleophosmin/B23 into the nucleolus is dependent on the cellular GTP level."

https://openalex.org/W1484348626,"The native phytochrome photoreceptor was purified to homogeneity from etiolated seedlings of oat (Avena sativa L.) and used for renaturation experiments. Light scattering measurements showed that the GroEL molecular chaperone interacts with non-native phytochrome to suppress aggregation of the refolding polypeptide, following its dilution from a chaotrope. The binary complex formed between non-native phytochrome and GroEL was stable and could be isolated by size exclusion chromatography. Discharge of the photoreceptor from GroEL was obtained with 2 mM MgATP, although 6 mM adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) was also effective. Phytochrome released from GroEL with MgATP was found primarily in the form of 124-kDa monomers, as judged by size exclusion chromatography and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, although dimers and other oligomeric forms were also observed. The reconstituted dimers, and other oligomeric forms, preferentially cross-reacted with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes native-like epitopes. In vitro folding reactions, using chemically denatured phytochrome, revealed that successful reconstitution of the photoreceptor required the presence of the GroEL chaperonin and MgATP under the conditions tested. Reconstitution in the presence of GroEL yielded phytochrome that could exhibit photoreversibility between the red-light absorbing and far-red absorbing forms."
https://openalex.org/W1518448964,"In addition to the antigen-specific T cell receptor, a number of other T cell surface molecules contribute to T cell adhesion and activation. CD2 is a 50-kDa glycoprotein found on the surface of human T lymphocytes which plays a role in T cell adhesion and stimulation. The intracellular mechanisms by which CD2 functions are, however, not fully defined. Here we show that the T cell surface molecule CD2 physically interacts with tubulin. This interaction appears to involve the membrane-proximal part of the cytoplasmic domain of the CD2 molecule, suggesting that CD2 binds to the tubulin fraction previously shown to be present in membranes. Stimulation of T cells with activating pairs of anti-CD2 antibodies, capable of initiating lymphokine production and T cell proliferation, disrupts the CD2-tubulin complexes, suggesting that the dynamic interaction of CD2 with tubulin may play a role in T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1527522904,"Increasing evidence indicates that heterotrimeric G proteins, and in particular Go, regulate ionic channel activities. In order to investigate the role of Go proteins in the modulation of the Ca2+ influx, C6 glioma cells were stably transfected with alpha o1 cDNA. Expression of the Go1 alpha protein was checked by Bordetella pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation and Western blots using one- and two-dimensional gel analyses. Three clones were selected based on their degree of Go1 alpha expression. In alpha o1-transfected cells, cAMP accumulations, in response to isoproterenol or forskolin, were lower than in control cells. This inhibitory effect was a function of the amount of expressed Go1 alpha. In contrast, Go1 alpha expression was not followed by a significant inhibition of isoproterenol- or forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities in particulate fractions. In C6 parental cells, 50-60% of the isoproterenol-induced cAMP accumulation was dependent on external Ca2+ concentration. This Ca(2+)-dependent cAMP accumulation was related to an induced transient Ca2+ influx. In transfected cells, expression of Go1 alpha inhibited the Ca2+ influx and the Ca(2+)-dependent component of isoproterenol-induced cAMP accumulation. In conclusion, beta-adrenergic agonists stimulate an entry of Ca2+ which exerts a positive feedback on cAMP production, and Go1 alpha blocks this positive feedback by inhibiting the Ca2+ influx."
https://openalex.org/W1532549214,"Although ribonucleases fold into correct tertiary conformation in vitro guided solely by information contained in the primary amino acid sequence (Sela, M., White, F. H., and Anfinsen, C. B. (1957) Science 124, 691-693), it is not clear whether folding of these proteins proceeds unassisted in a complex intracellular environment. We describe here the specific and high affinity binding of groEL, the prokaryotic homolog of the heat shock protein 60 family of molecular chaperones, to recombinant eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, two members of the human ribonuclease gene family. We have determined that groEL binds to a unique peptide sequence near the amino terminus of nascent eosinophil cationic protein that includes the first of eight cysteine residues. This binding site functions independently and can confer groEL binding activity on an unrelated carrier protein. GroEL dissociates from the binding site upon addition of ATP and Mg2+; no other cations or cofactors are necessary. These findings suggest the possibility that interaction with a groEL-like molecular chaperone may be a requirement for correct folding and/or translocation of eukaryotic ribonucleases in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1623552297,"Chaperonin isolated from Thermus thermophilus is stable up to 80 degrees C. Taking advantage of this heat stability, we have studied the effects of chaperonin on heat denaturation of several relatively heat labile enzymes. When the enzymes are incubated at their denaturating temperatures, the presence of T. thermophilus chaperonin in the solution has little effect on the rate of apparent inactivation of the enzyme. However, this inactivation is not irreversible since most activity is recovered when the solution is shifted to the second incubation at a moderate temperature with concomitant addition of MgATP. When the chaperonin is omitted from the solution, no recovery is observed. Recovery of the activity is also dependent on MgATP in the second incubation and 50% of recovery is attained at 5 microM MgATP. When the chaperonin is added after starting the incubation at a denaturing temperature, recovery of the activity becomes poorer as the delay of chaperonin addition increases. The critical temperature of the incubation at which irreversible denaturation occurs to the enzymes is elevated 8-15 degrees C by inclusion of T. thermophilus chaperonin in the solution. The heat stability of captured proteins by the chaperonin, assessed as retention of the ability to resume productive folding under optimal conditions, is measured more accurately using chemically produced folding intermediate-chaperonin complexes. The ability is lost at about 78 degrees C being irrespective of variable heat stability of individual enzymes. These results indicate that during heat denaturation proteins assume a common structure which is recognizable by the chaperonin. Once a protein with this structure is captured by T. thermophilus chaperonin, it retains the ability to resume productive folding even after exposure to the otherwise denaturing high temperature. Its heat stability seems to be limited solely by heat stability of chaperonin."
https://openalex.org/W1582749741,"Pretreatment with pertussis toxin produced a impairment of the response to the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine in perfused isolated rat livers. The sustained phases of phenylephrine-induced increases in respiration, glucose mobilization, gluconeogenesis, vascular resistance, and efflux of H+ and Ca2+ were inhibited to variable degrees in livers from pertussis toxin-treated animals. The susceptibility of such a diversity of receptor-mediated effects suggests that a common, most likely early step(s) of the alpha 1-receptor-coupled signaling pathway may be regulated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi protein(s) that appears to be involved in the control of the rate of these processes. The most significant effect of pertussis toxin has been to almost entirely prevent the phenylephrine-induced sustained release of Ca2+. Pertussis toxin also inhibited the vasopressin-mediated influx of Ca2+. These findings indicate that G proteins associated with receptor-operated calcium channels are a site of interaction of pertussis toxin. The following observations support the conclusion that pertussis toxin per se does not perturb the hepatic metabolism. Its effects are specifically linked to functional responses mediated by alpha 1-type adrenergic receptors: 1) polypeptide receptor-mediated metabolic effects, as those induced by vasopressin, were not affected by pertussis toxin; 2) non-receptor-mediated effects, such as fatty acid-induced stimulation of respiration and gluconeogenesis, were not impaired by pertussis toxin; and 3) neither the hepatic responses to alpha 2-(clonidine) nor to beta-(isoproterenol) adrenergic receptor agonists were altered in livers from pertussis toxin-treated rats. The differential effects of pertussis toxin in the metabolic actions of phenylephrine and vasopressin, in spite of apparently similar effects in perturbing their actions on Ca2+ fluxes, suggest that pertussis toxin-sensitive alpha 1-receptor-associated G protein(s) other than those controlling Ca2+ channels, were also specifically affected in the alpha 1-agonist-signaling pathway. The finding that increasing concentrations of phenylephrine were capable of overcoming these pertussis toxin actions indicates that alpha 1-adrenoreceptors' ligand affinity is controlled by Gi proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1510945532,"The biologically relevant receptor for atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) has been shown to be membrane-bound guanylate cyclase. While guanylate cyclase is known to be activated by ANF and ATP, the molecular mechanism of the enzyme activation remains unclear. We now show that melittin, the main peptide toxin of bee venom, activates membrane-bound guanylate cyclase and potentiates ANF- and ATP-stimulated guanylate cyclase activity in rat lung membranes. Melittin stimulated basal guanylate cyclase activity by increasing the Vmax without significantly affecting the Km of the substrate, GTP. However, melittin enhances ANF- and ATP-stimulated enzyme activity by altering both the Vmax and the EC50 of ANF and ATP. Although melittin activates guanylate cyclase in crude membranes, it has little effect on the activity of the purified enzyme. The effect of melittin on guanylate cyclase activation in rat lung membranes is attenuated by the Ca2+ chelator, EGTA. These results suggest that the effects of melittin on guanylate cyclase activation may require the participation of accessory proteins or nonprotein factors. Therefore, melittin would be a valuable tool for exploring the molecular mechanisms of ANF-mediated guanylate cyclase activation."
