https://openalex.org/W1486525201,"The reaction of perhydroxyl radical (HO2) with linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic acids has been studied in aqueous ethanolic solutions by the stopped flow technique. The corresponding rate constants are 1.2 x 10(3), 1.7 x 10(3), and 3.0 x 10(3) M-1 S-1, respectively. While kinetic results suggest that the HO2 radical reacts with the double allylic H atom of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, thermodynamic approximations indicate that the reaction is exothermic by approximately 10 kcal/mol. The relevance of this reaction to membrane damage observed in biological systems that have been exposed to HO2/O2- radicals is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1507967068,"The plasma membrane of cultured chromaffin cells from bovine adrenal medulla was rendered leaky by incubation in low concentrations of digitonin. Digitonin (20 microM) induced Ca2+-dependent release of 10-20% of the catecholamine in the presence of 10 microM Ca2+ without addition of secretagogue. Half-maximal catecholamine release occurred at approximately 1 microM Ca2+ x Mg2+ could not substitute for Ca2+. Cells incubated with digitonin rapidly lost their ability to exclude trypan blue. Digitonin caused release of the cytosolic markers lactic dehydrogenase and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase, but, in contrast to release of catecholamine, the release of the cytosolic proteins was inhibited by Ca2+. Soluble dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, a protein marker of granule contents, was released proportionally with catecholamine in a Ca2+ dependent manner. Catecholamine release was optimal in solutions containing MgATP. Hence, digitonin-treated cells, although they lose soluble cytosolic proteins and presumably low molecular weight cytosolic constituents, maintain the Ca2+-dependent reactions of exocytosis in the presence of MgATP. Digitonin-treated chromaffin cells may be a powerful system in which to study the biochemical mechanisms underlying exocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W1479900350,"Insulin receptor was purified 2400-fold with an overall yield of 40% from human placental membranes by affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose and insulin-Sepharose. The receptor was eluted from insulin-Sepharose using mild conditions, eliminating urea, so that it was stable and retained full insulin-binding activity. Chromatofocusing and gel filtration analysis indicated that the receptor preparation was apparently pure. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed three high molecular weight protein bands with Mr = 320,000, 300,000, and 270,000 under nonreducing conditions and two major protein bands with Mr = 135,000 and 90,000 under reducing conditions. The purified receptor showed a curvilinear Scatchard plot with maximum insulin binding of 28.5 micrograms per mg of protein. In comparison, the receptor eluted from insulin-Sepharose with previously used conditions in the presence of urea resulted in maximum insulin binding of only 6 micrograms per mg of protein. This indicates that a 4-to 5-fold increase in specific activity can be obtained by using the new elution conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1603652944,"Canalicular plasma membranes were isolated from rat liver homogenates using nitrogen cavitation and calcium precipitation methods. Compared with homogenates, the membranes were enriched 55- to 56-fold in gamma-glutamyltransferase, aminopeptidase M, and alkaline phosphatase activities and showed very low enrichment in markers of other membranes. By electron microscopy, the membrane preparation contained neither junctional complexes nor contaminating organelles and consisted exclusively of vesicles. The presence of vesicles was also evident from the osmotic sensitivity of D-[6-3H]glucose uptake into the membrane preparation. Antisera obtained from rabbits immunized with highly purified rat kidney gamma-glutamyltransferase inhibited the transferase activity of intact or Triton X-100-solubilized membranes by 45-55%. Treatment of vesicles with anti-gamma-glutamyltransferase antisera and anti-rabbit IgG antisera increased the apparent density of the membranes during sucrose density gradient centrifugation. gamma-Glutamyltransferase and aminopeptidase M activities were selectively removed from the vesicles by limited proteolysis with papain without changing the intravesicular space or alkaline phosphatase activity of the membranes. Specific binding of anti-gamma-glutamyltransferase antibody to the outer surface of isolated hepatocytes was observed as measured by the antisera and 125I-labeled protein A; binding followed saturation kinetics with respect to antibody concentration. These data indicate that the isolated canalicular membrane vesicles are exclusively oriented right-side-out and that gamma-glutamyltransferase and aminopeptidase M are located on the luminal side of rat liver canalicular plasma membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1660877423,"The malolactic enzyme of Lactobacillus plantarum was purified from 5.5 units/mg to a specific activity of 265 units/mg of protein. The enzyme has an isoelectric point of pH 4.4. The molecular weight is Mr = 140,000 as determined by gradient gel electrophoresis. The enzyme consists of two probably identical subunits (Mr = 70,000) that were observed after treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate. Malolactic enzyme catalyzes the NAD- and manganese-dependent reaction L-malate leads to CO2 + L-lactate. Therefore, this enzyme can be distinguished from the well known malic enzymes (L-malate: NAD+ oxidoreductase, oxalacetate-decarboxylating EC 1.1.1.38 or 1.1.1.39). Malolactic enzyme is found in most lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacteriaceae); it has not been detected in other bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W32715354,"An uncharacterized lectin from Vicia villosa seeds has been reported to bind specifically to mouse cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Kimura, A., Wigzell, H., Holmquist, G., Ersson, B., and Carlsson, P., (1979) J. Exp. Med. 149, 473-484). We have found that V. villosa seeds contain at least three lectins which we have purified by affinity chromatography on a column of immobilized porcine blood group substances eluted with varying concentrations of N-acetylgalactosamine and by anion exchange chromatography. The three lectins are composed of two different subunits with Mr = 35,900 (subunit B) and 33,600 (subunit A), estimated from their mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis suggests that the purified lectins are tetramers. They have been designated B4, A4, and A2B2 to indicate their apparent subunit compositions. The purified B4 and A4 lectins contain 6.7-9.8% carbohydrate by weight; in addition, both are rich in the acidic and hydroxylic amino acids and lack cysteine and methionine. The A4 lectin agglutinates A erythrocytes specifically and binds to A1 erythrocytes (273,000 sites/cell) with an association constant of 1.8 X 10(7) M-1. Although a blood group A agglutinating activity was recognized in the original preparation of V. villosa lectins, lectins with this activity were obtained in relatively small amounts from seed extracts. The predominant lectin in V. villosa seeds, B4, does not agglutinate A, B, or O erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1500505511,"A hypothetical model of the ligand interaction with the estrogen receptor binding site has been developed to describe the structural features necessary to initiate or to inhibit prolactin synthesis in vitro. The biological potency of the binding ligands is directly related to their relative binding affinity (RBA) for the estrogen receptor. The relative potencies of antiestrogens to inhibit estradiol-stimulated prolactin synthesis was trans-monohydroxytamoxifen identical to cis-monohydroxytamoxifen identical to tamoxifen, consistent with their RBAs for uterine estrogen receptor. Similarly the relative potency of estrogens to stimulate prolactin synthesis was diethylstilbestrol identical to estradiol greater than ICI 77,949 greater than ICI 47,699 identical to zuclomiphene, consistent with their RBAs. The compound LY126412 (trioxifene without the aminoethoxy side chain) did not interact with the estrogen receptor at the concentrations tested (10(-8)--10(-6) M) or exhibit estrogenic or antiestrogenic properties using the prolactin synthesis assay. Overall, the ligand-receptor model stresses the structural requirement for high affinity binding and the critical positioning of the alkylamino-ethoxy side chain in space (in relation to the ligand-binding site on the estrogen receptor) to prevent prolactin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1514370510,"The rate of exchange of G-actin with subunits of F-actin and the rate of hydrolysis of ATP in solutions of F-actin at steady state have been measured simultaneously. Subunit exchange kinetics were analyzed by both a treadmill model and an exchange-diffusion model. The best fit to a treadmill model of the data obtained in 0.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 mM ATP at 30 degrees C gave a treadmill efficiency (net monomers incorporated per ATP hydrolyzed) of 0.26, in good agreement with the previously reported s-value of 0.25 (Wegner, A. (1976) J. Mol. Biol. 108, 139-150) for similar ionic conditions. However, in this and other conditions with excess free divalent cations (Ca2+ or Mg2+), the observed exchange kinetics were in better agreement with an exchange-diffusion model than with a treadmilling model over the entire time course of the experiment. In the absence of excess divalent cations (50 mM KCl), exchange was too slow to be analyzed adequately by either model. Using the measured filament length distribution and the observed fit of the exchange-diffusion model to the data in 0.5 mM MgCl2, an on-rate constant of 2.8 x 10(6) M-1 S-1 and an off-rate constant of 5.8 s-1 were calculated. These values, while in good agreement with previously measured pre-steady state polymerization rate constants under different ionic conditions (Pollard, T. D., and Mooseker, M. S. (1981) J. Cell Biol. 88, 654-659), are about 30-fold higher than the rate constants predicted from the rate of ATP hydrolysis at steady state. To rationalize these discrepancies, a model is proposed in which a segment of F-actin subunits at one or both ends of the filament contains bound ATP at steady state."
https://openalex.org/W1552702611,"Genomic DNA containing a third yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase structural gene has been isolated on a bacterial plasmid designated pgap11. The complete nucleotide sequence of this structural gene was determined. The gene contains no intervening sequences, codon usage is highly biased, and the nucleotide sequence of the coding portion of this gene is 90% homologous to the other two glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes (Holland, J. P., and Holland, M. J. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 2596-2605). Based on the extent of nucleotide sequence divergence among the three glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes, it is likely that they arose as a consequence of two duplication events and the gene contained on the hybrid plasmid designated pgap11 is a product of the first duplication event. All three structural genes share extensive nucleotide sequence homology in the 5'-noncoding regions adjacent to the three respective translational initiation codons. The gene contained on pgap11 is not homologous to the others downstream from the respective translational termination codon, however. The 5' termini of messenger RNAs synthesized from the three glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and two yeast enolase genes have been mapped to sites ranging from 36 to 82 nucleotides upstream from the respective translational initiation codons. In each case the 5' terminus of the mRNA maps to a region of strong nucleotide sequence homology which is shared by all five structural genes. These latter data confirm that all five structural genes are expressed during vegetative cell growth and further support the hypothesis that a portion of the 5'-noncoding flanking region of the yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and enolase genes evolved from a common precursor sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1495659155,"The structure of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor was investigated by comparing polypeptides identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate (NaDodSO4)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with the size of the intact receptor in cell membranes as determined by target size analysis. Muscarinic receptors from human, dog, and rat brain, rat and dog cardiac muscle, and guinea pig ileum longitudinal smooth muscle labeled with [3H] propylbenzilylcholine mustard, a covalent affinity reagent, appeared as single polypeptides with molecular weights of 80,000 on NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gels. NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gels of ileum smooth muscle muscarinic receptor also consistently displayed smaller peptides of 64, 52, 42, 36, 23, and 18 kDa. In order to determine whether the 80-kDa protein represented all or only a portion of the muscarinic receptor, target size analysis was undertaken. Radiation-induced receptor inactivation was measured by loss of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate specific binding and by loss of [3H]propylbenzilylcholine mustard-labeled receptor protein on NaDodSO4 gels. Target size analysis of rat and human brain, canine heart, and guinea pig ileum smooth muscle muscarinic receptors all indicated that the intact membrane-bound receptor has an average molecular mass of 80,000 daltons. These data demonstrate that the protein isolated on NaDodSO4 gels represents the intact receptor molecule. The question of whether structurally distinct receptors exist in different tissues and species was answered, in part, by limited proteolysis studies of the 80-kDa protein isolated from the above tissues. Trypsin and papain produce peptides of 64, 52, 42, 36, 23, and 18 kDa from all receptors studied, indicating a lack of major structural diversity and the absence of multiple structural forms of the muscarinic receptor. Limited proteolysis of the membrane-bound receptor produces a major peptide of 42,000 daltons and minor peptides of 36, 23, and 18 kDa, all of which contain the ligand binding site and protrude from the membrane into the extracellular space."
https://openalex.org/W1491079881,"Four hybridoma cell lines were derived from the spleen cells of mice immunized with the neutral glycolipids of human meconium. The antibodies secreted by these lines were specific for the Lewis a antigen of the human Lewis blood group system as determined by solid phase immunoassay using synthetic carbohydrate antigens and by plate binding assay and thin layer chromatography-autoradiography using natural glycolipid antigens. Coating protein A-bearing Staphylococcus aureus with one of the antibodies yielded a stable reagent that produced rapid agglutination of Lewis a positive human erythrocytes. The fine structural specificity of these antibodies was assessed by competition radioimmunoassay using synthetic structural analogs of Lewis a conjugated to bovine serum albumin. One antibody was specific for the Lewis a trisaccharide (Gal beta 1 leads to 3(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 4) beta GlcNAc), while a second recognized the entire Lea (1 leads to 3) beta Gal tetrasaccharide. The third and fourth were directed at topography largely provided by only the alpha Fuc and beta GlcNAc units. These monoclonal antibodies not only represent potentially useful reagents for detecting the Lewis a antigen but also provide a system for studying precise relationships between anticarbohydrate antibody structure and binding specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1505250726,"To examine genetic factors involved in mammalian lipid transport, we present a detailed analysis of the plasma lipoproteins of the mouse and a survey of these lipoproteins among different inbred strains for genetic variations. Plasma lipoproteins were separated by differential ultracentrifugation into three density fractions: with densities less than 1.006 g/ml, between 1.006 and 1.063 g/ml, and between 1.063 and 1.21 g/ml. On agarose gels, the d less than 1.006 g/ml fraction migrated as a single major band with pre-beta mobility and appeared to correspond to human very low density lipoproteins based on its lipid and protein composition. The intermediate density class was heterogeneous, containing particles with beta and alpha mobilities on agarose gels. The 1.063-1.21 g/ml density fraction exhibited a single alpha-migrating band on agarose gels, characteristic of high density lipoprotein in other mammalian plasma. Marked genetic variation was seen for lipoprotein mobilities among different inbred strains. In Swiss random bred mice, most of the apoprotein was in high density lipoprotein (104 mg/dl of plasma). Lower protein concentrations of 8.5 and 6.2 mg/dl were found in the d = 1.006-1.063 g/ml class and in the very low density lipoprotein, respectively. Proteins thought to be homologous to human apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, B, and E were identified on the basis of their distributions among the lipoprotein fractions, their molecular weights and isoelectric points and, for A-I, B, and E, by their cross-reactivities with antibodies prepared against purified rat apolipoproteins. Considerable structural and quantitative variations also exist among these apolipoproteins isolated from different inbred mouse strains. Our results provide a basis for the use of the mouse as a model system for the study of the genetic control of lipid transport."

https://openalex.org/W1556072419,"a2HS-Glycoprotein, a normal human plasma protein, was recently shown to consist of two polypeptide chains. In the present study, we have separated these two chains from one another and have elucidated the complete primary structure of the B-chain. Employing automated Edman degradation, the polypeptide moiety of this chain was shown to consist of 27 amino acid residues with an unequal distribution of the neutral and charged amino acid residues. The first 20 residues are uncharged, whereas the carboxyl-terminal heptapeptide contains all charged residues. Utilizing 500MHz ‘H-NMR spectroscopy, the carbohydrate unit proved to be a trisaccharide consisting of sialic acid, galactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine 0-glycosidically linked to serine (residue 6). The structure of the Bchain was found to be as follows."

https://openalex.org/W1593383095,"Rabbit myocardial lysophospholipase was purified 27,000-fold to near homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-Sephacel, gel filtration, chromatofocusing, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. Chromatofocusing demonstrated two activity peaks, each with a molecular mass of 23,000 daltons by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both activity peaks had similar kinetic parameters (Vmax = 7 mumols/mg/min, Km = 9-11 microM) and similar pH profiles (7.5 optimum). Each activity peak was competitively inhibited by L-palmitoylcarnitine with similar inhibitory constants (KI = 10-11 microM). In addition, palmitic acid competitively inhibited myocardial lysophospholipase (KI = 37 microM). A rapid loss of lysophospholipase activity resulted from heating at 37 degrees C in the absence of substrate (t1/2 = 3 min). This thermal denaturation was attenuated similarly by either lysophosphatidylcholine (15 microM) or L-palmitoylcarnitine (15 microM). Thus, L-palmitoylcarnitine complexes with purified myocardial lysophospholipase and competitively inhibits a major pathway of lysophosphatidylcholine catabolism, thereby potentially contributing to accumulation of lysophosphatides in ischemic myocardium and ventricular dysrhythmia."
https://openalex.org/W1504831660,"The effects of divalent cations and protein-modifying reagents on the binding of agonist and antagonist ligands to D-2 dopaminergic receptors were studied. The divalent cations Mg2+, Ca2+, and Mn2+ markedly increase the binding of the agonist [3H]N-n-propylnorapomorphine ([3H]NPA) to the high affinity state of the pituitary D-2 receptor. The increase in [3H]NPA binding is due to both an increase in binding capacity (Bmax) and a decrease in the dissociation constant (KD). Monovalent cations have no effect on agonist binding either in the presence or absence of divalent cations. Neither divalent nor monovalent cations exert any effects on the binding of the antagonist, [3H]spiroperidol to pituitary D-2 receptors. Modification of sulfhydryl groups by N-ethylmaleimide and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate inactivates both [3H]NPA and [3H]spiroperidol binding; however, [3H]NPA binding exhibits a 50-fold greater sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide. Inactivation of both [3H]NPA and [3]spiroperidol binding by N-ethylmaleimide and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate results in a diminished binding capacity for both radioligands. The inactivation of [3H] spiroperidol-binding by N-ethylmaleimide and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate can be protected against by occupying the receptor site with either antagonists or agonists, however, such treatments do not protect against inactivation of [3H]NPA binding. The effects of selectively decreasing the receptor subunit concentration on the proportions of high and low affinity agonist-binding states was additionally examined. A phenoxybenzamine-induced decrease of up to 63% of the receptor-binding sites has no effect on the proportions of agonist-binding states as detected with agonist/[3H]spiroperidol-competition curves. These results can all be incorporated into a two-step, three-component ternary complex model in which the second binding reaction appears to be under equilibrium restraint."

https://openalex.org/W1538991359,"Two myosin heavy chain cDNA clones (251 and 110), constructed from chick embryonic skeletal muscle mRNA, were subjected to extensive DNA sequence analysis. A complete description of the DNA sequence of clone 251 was obtained. This 1.5-kilobase pair cDNA sequence specified the COOH-terminal 439 amino acids of the myosin heavy chain, and included the entire 3' nontranslated region. The translated and 3' nontranslated sequences were purine- (64%) and AT-(71%) rich, respectively. The derived amino acid sequence of clone 251 correlated well with sequences obtained by direct amino acid sequencing of adult rabbit back muscle myosin heavy chain protein (87% homology), as well as with cloned myosin heavy chain sequences from other species. Comparison of clone 251 with a partial DNA sequence of clone 110 revealed significant structural differences both in the translated, and 3' nontranslated regions. This data indicates that these two clones represent two distinct myosin heavy chain genes. The protein sequence specified by clone 251 corresponds to the light meromyosin portion of the myosin heavy chain rod. These sequences, like other myosin heavy chain rod sequences, are alpha-helical and exhibit 7- and 28-residue periodicities in the linear distribution of nonpolar, and basic and acidic amino acids, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1561091464,"We examined the dynamics of oxygen quenching and depolarization of tyrosine fluorescence in small peptides and proteins lacking tryptophan. The oxygen-quenching constants and the apparent correlation times for fluorescence depolarization were found to be sensitive to the conformational state of the proteins. For small peptides and random coil proteins, the oxygen bimolecular quenching constants indicated complete accessibility of the tyrosine residues to collisions with oxygen. For folded proteins, the quenching constants were about 2-fold smaller, indicating only limited shielding of the tyrosine residues from oxygen by the protein matrix. We also used the steady state anisotropies, measured under conditions of oxygen quenching, to estimate the motional freedom of the tyrosine residues. For random coil proteins, such as a tyrosine copolymer and histones at low pH, the data clearly indicated that depolarization occurs due to subnanosecond segmental motions of the tyrosine residues which are independent of overall protein rotation. For some folded proteins, including bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, the data are consistent with, but do not unambiguously demonstrate, motional freedom of the residues. In these cases, energy transfer among tyrosine residues may also contribute to the observed depolarization. Overall, these results indicate that the rate and extent of tyrosine rotation in proteins depend upon the conformation of the protein and the specific protein under observation."
https://openalex.org/W1509799647,"The acyl-CoA reductase component of the fatty acid reductase complex responsible for synthesis of long chain aldehydes for the bioluminescent reaction in bacteria has been purified to homogeneity. The enzyme copurified as part of the complex through the initial steps and was then resolved and further purified to give a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of molecular weight 58,000. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was 2 x 10(5), indicating it was an oligomeric enzyme containing identical subunits. The acyl-CoA reductase had a high specificity for NADPH with a Km value of 5 microM at optimal concentrations of tetradecanoyl-CoA (5-10 microM). The purified enzyme was discovered to have a high, intrinsic acyltransferase activity forming thioesters with a number of different thiol compounds (mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, 2-mercaptoethyl ether). The rates of the acyltransferase and acyl-CoA reductase reactions were similar to the rate of turnover of the fatty acid reductase complex suggesting that fatty acid reduction and not activation controls the rate of conversion of fatty acids to aldehydes."

https://openalex.org/W1530528120,"In a subline of T47D human breast cancer cells, progesterone receptors (PR) are synthesized at very high levels, but their synthesis is not estrogen-dependent. Despite the unusual control of synthesis, the physicochemical properties of PR are normal. These are, therefore, ideal cells to study PR regulation by progesterone, free of estrogen effects. In this paper, we show that nuclear translocation of PR is stoichiometric, and that an unusual and very rapid nuclear turnover, or processing step, characterizes receptor-DNA interactions. In intact T47D cells, PR are translocated to the nucleus only by progestins; 70-90% of cytoplasmic receptors are depleted at 37 degrees C within 5 min of progestin addition. After PR are translocated by 0.1 muM progesterone, they can be quantitatively recovered from nuclei only in the first 5 min; thereafter, a rapid nuclear processing step results in loss of 50-80% of the newly translocated sites. Rapid processing may be inherent to PR; it also occurs in PR of MCF-7 cells. The extent of receptor translocation and of nuclear receptor processing is dependent on the progesterone concentration and on the treatment time, and can be masked by endogenous hormones. Proteolytic enzyme inhibitors (leupeptin, antipain) do not prevent nuclear PR loss. G-C specific DNA intercalators that prevent nuclear estrogen receptor processing (actinomycin D, chromomycin A3) also fail to prevent PR loss, but some A-T specific DNA-binding dyes (chloroquine, primaquine, quinacrine) protect 50-75% of nuclear PR. We conclude that translocated nuclear PR can be quantitatively measured only at early time points because the nuclear receptors are rapidly processed. Furthermore, the processing step may involve an interaction of receptors with DNA since it can be partially blocked by DNA-binding agents."
https://openalex.org/W1605447271,"Iron, as ferric nitrilotriacetate or ferric ammonium citrate, was administered to rat hepatoma cells (H4AZC2) that were grown in serum-containing media or in hormone-supplemented defined media on collagen matrices. High levels of iron either retarded growth or were cytotoxic, so conditions were established for maximum iron loading where cells survived at near normal growth rates. In all cases, cells exposed to iron produced more ferritin than those grown in its absence, and elevated ferritin levels were paralleled by higher intracellular iron contents. Cells grown in serum-free media, however, took up iron more rapidly than corresponding cells in serum-supplemented media, and intracellular iron and ferritin also reached much higher levels. During exponential growth stages, for example, ferritin levels in iron-stimulated cells were 35-fold greater than those in control cells. These results indicate that transferrin is not required as an iron donor as the inorganic iron was taken up effectively and utilized to stimulate ferritin synthesis. Twenty-four hours after iron administration, endocytotic mechanisms were evident by the appearance of coated vesicles and pits and visible cytoskeletal structures. Subsequently, clusters of iron micelles appeared in the cell. Ferritin isolated from iron-overloaded cells were rich in L-type subunits, but newly synthesized ferritins in iron-stimulated or control cells had almost equivalent amounts of heavy and light subunit constituents."

The ratio of the two enzyme activities remained constant during purification and was unchanged by a variety of treatments of the purified enzyme. These results suggest that allantoinase and allantoicase are located in the same protein. It was found that the two hepatic enzyme activities are also associated with the same protein in other frogs (Xenopus laevis and Rana nigromacultata), tadpoles (R. catesbeiana), and newts (Triturus pyrrhogaster). In contrast, allantoinase and allantoicase were found to be different proteins in marine fish and invertebrate liver."

https://openalex.org/W1595173956,A small angle x-ray scattering study of a rhodopsin-lipid complex in hexane demonstrates the presence of two distinct particle populations with corresponding radii of gyration of approximately 22 and 160 A. A model based on the existence of inverted lipid micelles surrounding the protein polar moieties while the protein hydrophobic domains act as cross-links between the inverted micelles is presented. It accounts for the results herewith reported and explains most of the properties hitherto characterized for the rhodopsin-lipid complex in hexane.
https://openalex.org/W245379805,"This study compares the stabilizing effects of glycerol and sodium molybdate on the progesterone receptor in vitro. Trophoblastic tissue from day 12 embryos was homogenized in TD buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM dithiothreitol at pH 7.8, 4 degrees C) with 30% glycerol (v/v) (TDG-30%) and/or 10 mM sodium molybdate (TDG-30% + Mo and TD + Mo, respectively). Receptor was partially purified from cytosol by ammonium sulfate precipitation and incubated overnight (4 degrees C) with [3H]P +/- unlabeled progesterone in appropriate buffer to measure binding properties of the receptor under various buffer conditions. The effects of glycerol and sodium molybdate on sedimentation behavior of receptor in 5-20% sucrose gradients was studied in other experiments. Binding parameters were indeterminate when the receptor was incubated in the basic TD buffer only. However, in the presence of molybdate and/or glycerol high affinity binding was maintained at 0 and 15 degrees C (Kd congruent to 2 nM). In TD + Mo media high affinity binding was lost (Kd = 14 and 35 nM at 0 and 15 degrees C, respectively). The receptor always sedimented as 4-5 S forms unless molybdate was present whereupon they were replaced by 7-8 S moieties. Under conditions of high salt (0.3 M KCl) high affinity was preserved by glycerol, as in low salt conditions, and a new 6-7 S moiety occurred; in addition to this form, the 7-8 S aggregate was retained in the presence of molybdate. Thermodynamic studies showed that the addition of molybdate to glycerol media did not alter the energy of activation for progesterone-receptor interaction measured at 0 and 15 degrees C; however, at 30 degrees C molybdate was necessary to prevent denaturation of receptor. Glycerol and molybdate must be present from the time of tissue extirpation for maximum stabilization. Denaturation begins immediately and is only partially reversible. It is concluded that glycerol interacts with the surface of the receptor molecule in such a way as to favor the folded native state which preserves high affinity interactions whereas molybdate interacts directly with receptor to maintain 7-8 S aggregates which increases the availability of binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1530556840,"The association of the eighth (C8) and ninth (C9) components of human complement within membrane-bound C5b-9 was investigated using the photosensitive cross-linking reagent N-succinimidyl-6-(4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino)hexanoate. Reaction of this reagent with either the purified alpha-gamma or beta subunit of C8 resulted in the introduction of 6-8 mol/mol of photosensitive 6-(4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino)hexanoate (ANH) as an intrinsic ligand on each protein. The resulting ANH-(alpha-gamma) or ANH-(beta) was capable of recombining with equimolar amounts of beta or alpha-gamma, respectively, to yield ANH-C8. Parallel modifications of purified C9 resulted in incorporation of 3-4 mol/mol of ANH-ligand. Both ANH-C8 and ANH-C9 retained their ability to incorporate into C5b-9. Two approaches were used to determine the proximity of C8 subunits to C9 within C5b-9. In one, the complex was assembled on erythrocytes by incubating EAC1-7 cells separately with each form of ANH-C8 and subsequently saturating with 125I-C9. After lysis, membranes were irradiated, solubilized, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Cross-linking was assessed by a shift in electrophoretic mobility of 125I-C9 to a higher molecular weight. Results using either form of ANH-C8 in C5b-9 showed that, although at least 30% was involved in cross-linking, none was cross-linked to C9. Similar results were obtained using a second approach in which cross-linker and radiolabel were transposed between C8 and C9. Here, EAC1-7 cells were incubated first with 125I-C8 containing either 125I-(alpha-gamma) or 125I-(beta) and subsequently with ANH-C9. Although at least 48% of ANH-C9 in C5b-9 was involved in cross-linking in these experiments, no cross-linking to either subunit of C8 was detected. These results suggest that C8 is not in close physical association with C9 within membrane-bound C5b-9."
https://openalex.org/W1587331238,"The association-dissociation of yeast hexokinase has been re-examined and the size of the reacting form of the enzyme has been investigated under a variety of conditions. Both Sephacryl S-200 and high performance liquid chromatography on Bio-Sil have been employed with continuous effluent monitoring under reacting and nonreacting conditions. The reacting enzyme was monomeric under all conditions, suggesting that the dimer is not an important catalytic species in normal assays. The reacting enzyme remained as a monomer under the following conditions: 0.1-15 micrograms/ml loading concentration, from 30 to 100 mM ionic strength, with 2 mM citrate, with 50% D2O, and at 160 atm hydrostatic pressure. The dissociation constant for the nonreacting hexokinase was 22 (+/- 2) micrograms/ml (uncorrected for 5-fold dilution) in 100 mM triethanolamine, pH 6.5, and 25 degrees C. Glucose or MgATP had dissociative effects under all conditions studied, but MgATP was much less effective and only slightly more effective than an equivalent ionic strength. NaCl, between 30 and 80 mM, promoted dissociation, with a concomitant conformational change suggested by nonlinearity of log-log plots. The extent of dissociation with MgCl2 was slightly greater than an equivalent NaCl ionic strength and the shape of the association curves suggested the formation of an elongated dimer in the presence of MgCl2. The conclusion is made that hexokinase is monomeric under most assay conditions and that the dissociation is predominantly the result of the glucose interaction. High performance liquid chromatography has been shown to be a useful method of assessing the association state of enzymes under both reacting and nonreacting conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1575205387,"The acyl-binding sites of avian fatty acid synthase have been further characterized using the fluorescent acetyl-CoA analog, beta-[N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl]alanyl coenzyme A (NBDA-CoA). Binding to nonsulfhydryl sites has been studied by treatment with neutralized hydroxylamine to remove NBDA bound in a thioester linkage. The binding of NBDA to hydroxylamine-insensitive sites can be divided into two types: and tight. The NBDA bound at the loose site can be removed by rapid gel filtration through a centrifuge column or by added CoA and is kinetically competent to be the loading site for acyl groups. The NBDA binds to the tight site apparently irreversibly and inhibits the overall enzyme activity completely at a stoichiometry of approximately 2 per enzyme molecule. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate can modify a large number of enzyme amino groups (greater than or equal to 20) and totally inhibits the enoyl reductase activity. This inhibition appears to be correlated with the binding of approximately four molecules of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate per enzyme molecule. Although the beta-ketoacyl reductase activity is unimpaired, the binding of NADPH at the sites involved in this activity is weakened. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency from NADPH, bound to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate modified enzyme, to enzyme-bound NBDA, or from NADPH, bound to unmodified enzyme, to NBDA bound only at the tight hydroxylamine-insensitive sites is not significantly different from the overall efficiency previously reported. This suggests that all of the acyl-binding sites are located approximately the same distance from the enoyl reductase and beta-ketoacyl reductase catalytic sites."
https://openalex.org/W1510259867,"The noncovalently associated 125I-insulin-receptor complex was isolated from human erythrocyte membranes after allowing 125I-insulin to interact with the membranes followed by extraction of the 125I-insulin-receptor complex with Triton X-102 or, alternatively, by complete solubilization of the membranes with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), removal of SDS, and then treatment of the solubilized sample with 125I-insulin. Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography of the 125I-insulin-receptor complex obtained by both of the above procedures yielded a highly radioactive 140,000-Da complex which was dissociated into small peptides when subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In contrast, when the 125I-insulin-treated membrane sample was extracted with Triton X-102, purified by DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange chromatography, covalently cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate, and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a highly radioactive component with Mr = 53,000 was obtained. On the other hand, when the Triton X-102-solubilized membrane receptor sample was fractionated by DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange chromatography, complexed with 125I-insulin, covalently crosslinked, and then applied to a Sepharose CL-6B column, a 95,000-Da complex with high specific radioactivity was obtained. Upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the 95,000-Da complex was dissociated into a 53,000-Da component which appeared identical with that obtained from the receptor complex described above which was obtained by direct interaction of the membranes with 125I-insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1515328340,"Incubation of crude estrogen receptor preparations from mammary tumor cytosol with RNase A increases the sedimentation coefficient of the receptor from 9.7 S to 10.4 S. The effect is not obtained with other low molecular weight basic proteins (lysozyme, cytochrome c, or histone H2B). Nonenzymically active RNase A derivatives such as performic acid oxidized RNase A, fully reductively methylated RNase A, carboxymethyl-His-119-RNase A, and RNase S-protein were ineffective. RNase T1, an acidic endoribonuclease, was also without effect. However, enzymically active RNase S', prepared from a mixture of RNase S-protein and S-peptide, shifted the sedimentation to 10.4 S. The increased sedimentation is not accompanied by a change in the Stokes radius of the receptor (74 A) or buoyant density in metrizamide (1.24 g/ml). The effect of RNase A on the sedimentation of the receptor can be reversed by subsequent incubation with human placental RNase inhibitor or with rabbit anti-RNase A antibodies. Direct interaction was shown by chromatography of the receptor on RNase A Sepharose. Thus, the shift in sedimentation results from binding of RNase A to the receptor and, although this requires that the enzyme active site be available, enzymic activity is not responsible for the effect. The interaction of RNase A with the receptor occurs at low ionic strength; it does not occur at elevated ionic strength or after activation of the receptor by precipitation with ammonium sulfate."

https://openalex.org/W1530431628,"High density lipoproteins (HDL) have been implicated in the transformation of native triglyceride-rich lipoproteins into their corresponding remnant particles during the action of peripheral lipoprotein lipase. The subsequent metabolism of these remnant particles by the liver results in the inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis. In the present study, remnant particles of chylomicrons or very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) have been generated in the perfused heart system both in the absence and presence of HDL. These have been characterized chemically, and the effects of both native lipoproteins and their respective remnants on fatty acid synthetic rates of hepatocytes have been assessed. Thirty to sixty-six per cent of the triglyceride moieties of native lymph chylomicrons or VLDL were hydrolyzed during a 45-min heart perfusion whether or not HDL was present in the perfusion media. Chylomicron remnants produced in the absence of HDL (25-300 micrograms/ml) caused only 10-20% inhibition of hepatic fatty acid synthesis, whereas remnants produced in the presence of HDL caused up to 78% inhibition at equivalent protein concentrations. The nonsuppressive remnants (produced in the absence of HDL) were converted to suppressive remnants upon incubation with HDL. Similar results were obtained with VLDL remnants produced in the absence and presence of HDL. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis apoprotein profiles of the nonsuppressive and suppressive remnants indicated a marked loss of the C apoproteins during the conversion of native chylomicrons or the nonsuppressive remnants to the suppressive remnants. Thus, HDL seems to be required for the removal of apoprotein C during the transformation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to the suppressive remnants. There was, however, no enrichment of apo-E on the suppressive remnant particles. We, thus, could not verify the suggested role of HDL in enriching the suppressive remnants with apoproteins E."
