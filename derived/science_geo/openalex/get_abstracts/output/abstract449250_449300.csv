https://openalex.org/W2144693286,"The diversity and abundance of wild insect pollinators have declined in many agricultural landscapes. Whether such declines reduce crop yields, or are mitigated by managed pollinators such as honey bees, is unclear. We found universally positive associations of fruit set with flower visitation by wild insects in 41 crop systems worldwide. In contrast, fruit set increased significantly with flower visitation by honey bees in only 14% of the systems surveyed. Overall, wild insects pollinated crops more effectively; an increase in wild insect visitation enhanced fruit set by twice as much as an equivalent increase in honey bee visitation. Visitation by wild insects and honey bees promoted fruit set independently, so pollination by managed honey bees supplemented, rather than substituted for, pollination by wild insects. Our results suggest that new practices for integrated management of both honey bees and diverse wild insect assemblages will enhance global crop yields."

We found degradation of interaction network structure and function and extirpation of 50% of bee species. Network changes can be attributed to shifts in forb and bee phenologies resulting in temporal mismatches, nonrandom species extinctions, and loss of spatial co-occurrences between extant species in modified landscapes. Quantity and quality of pollination services have declined through time. The historic network showed flexibility in response to disturbance; however, our data suggest that networks will be less resilient to future changes."

Thus, the mechanisms influencing precipitation in this region have been the subject of research for decades. Previous studies suggest Asian dust enhances cloud ice and precipitation, whereas few studies consider biological aerosols as an important global source of ice nuclei (IN). Here, we show that dust and biological aerosols transported from as far as the Sahara were present in glaciated high-altitude clouds coincident with elevated IN concentrations and ice-induced precipitation. This study presents the first direct cloud and precipitation measurements showing that Saharan and Asian dust and biological aerosols probably serve as IN and play an important role in orographic precipitation processes over the western United States."
https://openalex.org/W2072878021,"Double Whammy Psychopathologies that cannot be explained by simple genetic or environmental circumstances may sometimes result from complex interplay between multiple inputs. Giovanoli et al. (p. 1095 ) analyzed the interactions between prenatal and postnatal stressors in mice to see what synergies give rise to psychopathologies in the adult mice. The results suggest that susceptibilities arise when mice are exposed to prenatal infection and also exposed to stressors around puberty. Stressors delivered later in adolescence did not seem to produce the same susceptibility. Although the mechanisms that impose the delay between stressors and psychopathology remain obscure, the timing and sequence of the triggers hint at possible cellular causes."

https://openalex.org/W2034966611,"Type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β) are important for protection against many viral infections, whereas type II interferon (IFN-γ) is essential for host defense against some bacterial and parasitic pathogens. Study of IFN responses in human leprosy revealed an inverse correlation between IFN-β and IFN-γ gene expression programs. IFN-γ and its downstream vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial genes were preferentially expressed in self-healing tuberculoid lesions and mediated antimicrobial activity against the pathogen Mycobacterium leprae in vitro. In contrast, IFN-β and its downstream genes, including interleukin-10 (IL-10), were induced in monocytes by M. leprae in vitro and preferentially expressed in disseminated and progressive lepromatous lesions. The IFN-γ-induced macrophage vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial peptide response was inhibited by IFN-β and by IL-10, suggesting that the differential production of IFNs contributes to protection versus pathogenesis in some human bacterial infections."

However, temperature can influence atmospheric CO 2 as well as be influenced by it. Studies of polar ice cores have concluded that temperature increases during periods of rapid warming have preceded increases in CO 2 by hundreds of years. Parrenin et al. (p. 1060 ; see the Perspective by Brook ) present a revised age scale for the atmospheric component of Antarctic ice cores, based on the isotopic composition of the N 2 that they contain, and suggest that temperature and CO 2 changed synchronously over four intervals of rapid warming during the last deglaciation."

https://openalex.org/W2061546617,"A Role for IFN-ɛ Type I interferons (IFNs) are critical cytokines involved in host defense against pathogens, particularly viruses. IFN-ɛ is an IFN-like gene encoded within the type I IFN locus in mice and humans whose function has not been characterized. Fung et al. (p. 1088 ) created mice with a genetic deletion in Ifn -ɛ and found that, like other type I IFNs, IFN-ɛ signals through the IFN-α receptors 1 and 2. However, unlike these other cytokines, which are primarily expressed by immune cells and are induced upon immune cell triggering, IFN-ɛ was expressed exclusively by epithelial cells of the female reproductive tract in both mice and humans and its expression was hormonally regulated. IFN-ɛ–deficient mice were more susceptible to infection with herpes simplex virus 2 and Chlamydia muridarum , two common sexually transmitted pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W2039881906,"Keratins 8 and 18 (K8/18) are simple epithelial cell-specific intermediate filament proteins. Keratins are essential for tissue integrity and are involved in intracellular signaling pathways that regulate cell response to injuries, cell growth, and death. K8/18 expression is maintained during tumorigenesis; hence, they are used as a diagnostic marker in tumor pathology. In recent years, studies have provided evidence that keratins should be considered not only as markers but also as regulators of cancer cell signaling. The loss of K8/18 expression during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with metastasis and chemoresistance. In the present study, we investigated whether K8/18 expression plays an active role in EMT. We show that K8/18 stable knockdown using shRNA increased collective migration and invasiveness of epithelial cancer cells without modulating EMT markers. K8/18-depleted cells showed PI3K/Akt/NF-κB hyperactivation and increased MMP2 and MMP9 expression. K8/18 deletion also increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Increased Fas receptor membrane targeting suggests that apoptosis is enhanced via the extrinsic pathway. Interestingly, we identified the tight junction protein claudin1 as a regulator of these processes. This is the first indication that modulation of K8/18 expression can influence the phenotype of epithelial cancer cells at a transcriptional level and supports the hypothesis that keratins play an active role in cancer progression.

Metastasis, the foremost cause of mortality in cancer patients, is a coordinated biological process involving multiple intracellular signaling pathways. In the early steps of metastasis, carcinoma cells undergo a “dedifferentiation” process, also called “epithelial-mesenchymal transition” (EMT), 3The abbreviations used are: EMTepithelial-mesenchymal transitionMMPmetalloproteinaseIFintermediate filamentK8keratin 8K18keratin 18PIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphatePIP3phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphatePTENphosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10PARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseIGF-1insulin-like growth factor-1NF-κBnuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cellsIκBαNF-κB inhibitor αTJtight junctionCLDN1claudin1XIAPX-linked inhibitor of apoptosis proteinsFLIPshort variant of FLICE-like inhibitory proteinFLICEFas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1b-converting enzymeFasRFas receptorNCnegative control. which is characterized by loss of cell polarity, alteration of cell junctions, and reorganization of cytoskeletal components. Activation of several transcription factors also promotes the degradation of extracellular matrix through expression of metalloproteinases (MMPs) and increases resistance to apoptosis. All together these changes enhance invasiveness and chemoresistance, making the EMT process a hallmark of tumor progression (1Kalluri R. Weinberg R.A. The basics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.J. Clin. Investig. 2009; 119: 1420-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (7274) Google Scholar). Among all these phenotypic changes, the reduction or loss of keratin proteins is often considered as a histological and biochemical feature for tumor cells that are going through an EMT (2Thiery J.P. Sleeman J.P. Complex networks orchestrate epithelial-mesenchymal transitions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). Keratins are epithelial cell-specific intermediate filament (IF) proteins that are expressed in a tissue- and differentiation state-specific manner. Keratins 8 and 18 (K8/18) are typically co-expressed as the primary keratin pair in simple epithelial cells, and their expression is maintained during malignant transformation until the tumor becomes invasive. Their specific re-expression in tissue metastasis explains their use as a diagnostic marker in determining tumor origin (3Moll R. Divo M. Langbein L. The human keratins: biology and pathology.Histochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 129: 705-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). As part of the cytoskeleton, keratins are important for the mechanical stability and integrity of epithelial cells and tissues. Keratin filaments form a complex network that extends from the periphery of the nucleus to the plasma membrane where they associate with desmosomes and hemidesmosomes. IF proteins are not only structural but are now also considered as regulatory proteins (for a review, see Ref. 4Eriksson J.E. Dechat T. Grin B. Helfand B. Mendez M. Pallari H.M. Goldman R.D. Introducing intermediate filaments: from discovery to disease.J. Clin. Investig. 2009; 119: 1763-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). For instance, they regulate organelle positioning and protein targeting (5Toivola D.M. Tao G.Z. Habtezion A. Liao J. Omary M.B.

Moreover, a number of keratins are involved in intracellular signaling pathways that regulate response to injuries (6Ku N.O. Omary M.B.

Thus, a concept emerges from these different studies that IFs should not be considered only as marker proteins in tumor cells but also as regulators of cancer cell signaling. For instance, our previous work highlighted a link between the oncogenic Akt isoforms and IF protein expression (20Fortier A.M. Van Themsche C. Asselin E. Cadrin M. Akt isoforms regulate intermediate filament protein levels in epithelial carcinoma cells.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the PI3K/Akt pathway has been shown to play a major role in tumorigenesis, chemoresistance, and EMT (21Testa J.R.

Class I PI3Ks are heterodimeric proteins composed of a regulatory subunit (p85) and a catalytic subunit (p110). Activated PI3K phosphorylates phosphoinositides at position 3 of the inositol ring to generate the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which promotes Akt activation (25Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Characterization of a 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase which phosphorylates and activates protein kinase Bα.Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process is antagonized by the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue PTEN that hydrolyzes the PIP3 to generate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (26Zhang S. Yu D. PI(3)king apart PTEN's role in cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2010; 16: 4325-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In epithelial polarized cells, PIP3 is specifically localized at the basolateral plasma membrane (27Gassama-Diagne A. Yu W. ter Beest M. Martin-Belmonte F. Kierbel A. Engel J. Mostov K. Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate regulates the formation of the basolateral plasma membrane in epithelial cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), whereas PTEN localizes to the apical plasma membrane where it enhances PIP2 levels (28Martin-Belmonte F. Gassama A. Datta A.

Considering that the leading edge of migrating cells has a composition similar to that of the basolateral surface of epithelia, PI3K/PTEN have been proposed to maintain the phosphoinositide gradient that establishes front-to-back polarity in invasive cancer cells (29Funamoto S.

In the present study, we investigated the role of K8/18 loss in EMT. Because we have previously shown that Akt isoforms induce reorganization of the IF network (20Fortier A.M. Van Themsche C. Asselin E. Cadrin M. Akt isoforms regulate intermediate filament protein levels in epithelial carcinoma cells.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we analyzed the role of the K8/18 network in PI3K/Akt signaling in the context of cell motility, invasion, and cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Human endometrial carcinoma KLE, human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2, and human cervical carcinoma HeLa cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in DMEM (without HEPES for KLE) supplemented with 10% FBS (KLE and HepG2) or 2% bovine growth serum (HeLa) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Sigma). K8/18 stable knockdown was achieved using SureSilencing predesigned short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences against keratin 8, keratin 18, or scrambled negative control (NC) (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI), and G418 was applied for isolating resistant clones (Invivogen, San Diego, CA). Transient gene silencing was performed using 100 nm scrambled NC small interfering RNA (siRNA), claudin1 siRNA (oligo1 ID, 138564; oligo2 ID, 29051; Ambion, Invitrogen), or NF-κBp65 siRNA (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) delivered in cells using TransIT-TKO reagent following the supplier's instructions (Mirus Bio LLC, Madison, WI). Transient transfection of claudin1 full-length cDNA was carried out using the pCMV-SPORT6 vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Modulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was done with 200 ng/ml recombinant IGF-1 (Sigma), 5–50 μm LY294002, or 0.2–1 μm wortmannin (Cell Signaling Technology). Cisplatin was purchased from Sigma. Cell proliferation was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described (31Van Themsche C. Mathieu I. Parent S.

Fluorescence intensities of every pixel within three individual lines drawn across the cell membrane were divided by their average cytoplasmic fluorescence intensities using ImageJ software. To evaluate cell motility, cells were grown to near confluence, and a wound was created with the blunt end of a tip. Images were captured at fixed time points between 0 and 48 h postwounding, and the pictures were analyzed using ImageJ software. The results were plotted as a percentage of wound closure compared with the area of the initial wound. Each experiment was performed in duplicates and repeated three times. Invasive properties of cells were measured using 2 mg/ml Matrigel-coated Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences). Invasive cells that had adhered to the porous insert were fixed in methanol, and nuclear staining was performed with Hoechst dye. Total fluorescence of each insert was quantified by densitometric analysis. Each experiment was performed in duplicates and repeated three times. PI3K activity was assessed using a commercially available phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ELISA kit (K-1000s, Echelon Biosciences, Salt Lake City, UT). The cell lysates were precleared, immunoprecipitated with PI3Kp85 antibody, and incubated with dioctanoyl-PIP2 substrate and reaction buffer. The amount of PIP3 formed from PIP2 by PI3K activity was detected using a competitive ELISA. Absorbance of the samples was measured at 450 nm, and PIP3 was quantified by comparison with a PIP3 standard curve carried out in parallel with the experimental samples and plotted on a log scale. Total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and PCRs were performed as described previously (31Van Themsche C. Mathieu I. Parent S. Asselin E.

Each real time PCR was performed in duplicates from at least three independent experiments. Human CLDN1 was amplified using sense primer 5′-ccctatgaccccagtcaatg-3′ and antisense primer 5′-acctcccagaaggcagaga-3′. For MMPs, expression was determined using sense primer 5′-atgccgcctttaactggag-3′ and antisense primer 5′-aagaagtagctgtgaccgcc-3′ for MMP2 and sense primer 5′-gcactgcaggatgtcatagg-3′ and antisense primer 5′-acgacgtcttccagtaccga-3′ for MMP9. 18 S rRNA was used as a reference gene based on its stable expression in all cell clones. The ChIP assay was done using an EZ-ChIP kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One-tenth of sonicated (10 × 12-s pulse) and precleared chromatin from 2.5 × 107 HepG2 shK8/18 or HeLa cells was used for each ChIP. Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C overnight with 1 μg of NF-κBp65 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), RNA polymerase II antibody (Millipore), or normal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The supernatant from the above reaction lacking the primary antibody was saved as total input of chromatin and processed in the same way as the eluted immunoprecipitates, starting with the cross-linking reversal step. Inputs and immunoprecipitates were amplified using CLDN1 promoter-specific primers under conditions listed in Table 1. COX2 and GAPDH promoter-specific primers served as positive and negative controls, respectively (Table 1). PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels in Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Cells were transfected with NF-κB-Luc reporter plasmid (pGL4.32) and TK-hRLuc (pGL4.74) in a 10:1 ratio. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with NC or claudin1 siRNA for 24 h followed by the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay (Promega). Each experiment was repeated three times. The induction of apoptosis was determined by counting the apoptotic cells (irregular Hoechst nuclear staining with multiple bright specks of chromatin fragmentation and condensation) stained with Hoechst 33258 dye (Sigma) and by flow cytometer analysis of annexin V/propidium iodide staining as described previously (36Chaudhry P. Singh M. Parent S. Asselin E. Prostate apoptosis response 4 (Par-4), a novel substrate of caspase-3 during apoptosis activation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 826-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated three times. Statistical analyses were carried out with GraphPad (La Jolla, CA) Prism software, version 3.03. Differences between experimental groups were determined using Student's t test. Statistical significance was accepted when the p value was <0.05. The conversion of epithelial cell into mesenchymal cell involves a change in the composition of IF proteins such that epithelial cells lose the expression of keratins and take on the expression of vimentin, a mesenchymal cell-specific IF protein (2Thiery J.P. Sleeman J.P. Complex networks orchestrate epithelial-mesenchymal transitions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of the keratin cytoskeleton in EMT, we used an RNA interference approach targeted against K8/18 to mimic keratin loss during the EMT process. We used two epithelial carcinoma cell lines whose various differentiation states constitute an interesting experimental model: the HepG2 cell line obtained from well differentiated carcinoma (K8/18+; vimentin−) and the KLE cell line from a poorly differentiated carcinoma (K8/18+; vimentin+). To generate an effective monoclonal population of cells deficient in K8/18, we used shRNA constructs. We monitored the knockdown efficiency by analyzing K8 and K18 protein levels. We observed a decrease of 80% in KLE cells and of more than 90% in HepG2 cells when compared with negative control cells (shNC) expressing scrambled shRNA (Fig. 1A). Moreover, specificity of the knockdown was validated by analyzing the expression levels of other keratin proteins normally expressed in the KLE cell line. Keratin 7 and keratin 19 were not affected by K8/18 knockdown (Fig. 1A). As keratin loss is associated with EMT, first we determined whether K8/18 depletion induced expression of EMT markers. Western blot analysis showed that E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin levels were not modified in K8/18 knockdown cells (Fig. 1B). Moreover, there were no detectable levels of Snail and Slug transcription factors in both cell lines (data not shown). Immunofluorescence staining with anti-phalloidin and anti-β-tubulin antibodies also demonstrated that K8/18 knockdown did not affect cell morphology or cytoskeletal organization of actin and microtubule networks (Fig. 1C). However, using in vitro wound healing and Transwell invasion assays, we observed that K8/18 knockdown directly affected the motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. Indeed, K8/18-deficient cells closed the wound 2–3 times faster than the control cells (Fig. 1D). Moreover, K8/18 depletion significantly increased cell invasion through Matrigel of KLE (2.1 ± 0.12-fold, p < 0.0002) and HepG2 cells (1.95 ± 0.28-fold, p < 0.0247) (Fig. 1E). The increase in cell invasion was not due to an enhanced proliferation because results from 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays revealed that stable knockdown of K8/18 had either no effect on or rather decreased cell viability (Fig. 1F). The PI3K/Akt pathway plays a pivotal role in cancer cell motility and invasion. We proceeded to an analysis of the expression levels of proteins involved in this pathway. KLE cells constitutively express the three Akt isoforms in their activated/phosphorylated form, making this cell line a very useful tool for the present study (33Gagnon V. Van Themsche C. Turner S. Leblanc V. Asselin E. Akt and XIAP regulate the sensitivity of human uterine cancer cells to cisplatin, doxorubicin and Taxol.Apoptosis. 2008; 13: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The antibody against phospho-Akt recognizes two distinct bands on the blot; the upper band corresponds to phosphorylated Akt1 and Akt3, and the lower band corresponds to phosphorylated Akt2. This interpretation comes from a previous study in which we characterized the antibody against Akt phosphorylated on serine 473 (catalog number 9271, Cell Signaling Technology) (33Gagnon V. Van Themsche C. Turner S. Leblanc V. Asselin E. A"

Here, we show that GPR84 was activated by MCFAs with the hydroxyl group at the 2- or 3-position more effectively than nonhydroxylated MCFAs. We also identified a surrogate agonist, 6-n-octylaminouracil (6-OAU), for GPR84. These potential ligands and the surrogate agonist, 6-OAU, stimulated [(35)S]GTP binding and accumulated phosphoinositides in a GPR84-dependent manner. The surrogate agonist, 6-OAU, internalized GPR84-EGFP from the cell surface. Both the potential ligands and 6-OAU elicited chemotaxis of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and macrophages and amplified LPS-stimulated production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 from PMNs and TNFα from macrophages. Furthermore, the intravenous injection of 6-OAU raised the blood CXCL1 level in rats, and the inoculation of 6-OAU into the rat air pouch accumulated PMNs and macrophages in the site. Our results indicate a proinflammatory role of GPR84, suggesting that the receptor may be a novel target to treat chronic low grade inflammation associated-disease."

However, in mosses, a basal land plant, the primary biomass is composed of the haploid gametophyte. Sakakibara et al. (p. 1067 ; see the Perspective by Friedman ) analyzed loss-of-function mutants of KNOX2 (class 2 KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX) genes in the moss Physcomitrella patens. Mutant plants exhibit apospory, where fertilization apparently occurs, but the normal sporophyte phase is bypassed and instead a diploid structure resembling a haploid gametophyte is produced. The results suggest that KNOX2 regulates the alternation of generations by suppressing the haploid body plan in the diploid phase."
https://openalex.org/W2071955997,"The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is a G protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in brain tissue that has been implicated in several disease states. CB1 allosteric compounds, such as ORG27569, offer enormous potential as drugs over orthosteric ligands, but their mechanistic, structural, and downstream effects upon receptor binding have not been established. Previously, we showed that ORG27569 enhances agonist binding affinity to CB1 but inhibits G protein-dependent agonist signaling efficacy in HEK293 cells and rat brain expressing the CB1 receptor (Ahn, K. H., Mahmoud, M. M., and Kendall, D. A. (2012) J. Biol. Chem. 287, 12070-12082). Here, we identify the mediators of CB1 receptor internalization and ORG27569-induced G protein-independent signaling. Using siRNA technology, we elucidate an ORG27569-induced signaling mechanism for CB1 wherein β-arrestin 1 mediates short term signaling to ERK1/2 with a peak at 5 min and other upstream kinase components including MEK1/2 and c-Src. Consistent with these findings, we demonstrate co-localization of CB1-GFP with red fluorescent protein-β-arrestin 1 upon ORG27569 treatment using confocal microscopy. In contrast, we show the critical role of β-arrestin 2 in CB1 receptor internalization upon treatment with CP55940 (agonist) or treatment with ORG27569. These results demonstrate for the first time the involvement of β-arrestin in CB1-biased signaling by a CB1 allosteric modulator and also define the differential role of the two β-arrestin isoforms in CB1 signaling and internalization."

https://openalex.org/W1986057818,"MSCs possess potent immunosuppressive capacity. We have reported that mouse MSCs inhibit T cell proliferation and function via nitric oxide. This immune regulatory capacity of MSCs is induced by the inflammatory cytokines IFNγ together with either TNFα or IL-1β. This effect of inflammatory cytokines on MSCs is extraordinary; logarithmic increases in the expression of iNOS and chemokines are often observed. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this robust effect of cytokines, we examined the expression of microRNAs in MSCs before and after cytokine treatment. We found that miR-155 is most significantly up-regulated. Furthermore, our results showed that miR-155 inhibits the immunosuppressive capacity of MSCs by reducing iNOS expression. We further demonstrated that miR-155 targets TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2) to regulate iNOS expression. Additionally, knockdown of TAB2 reduced iNOS expression. In summary, our study demonstrated that miR-155 inhibits the immunosuppressive capacity of MSCs by reducing iNOS expression by targeting TAB2. Our data revealed a novel role of miR-155 in regulating the immune modulatory activities of MSCs."

https://openalex.org/W2084428196,"The evolutionarily conserved Mediator complex is central to the regulation of gene transcription in eukaryotes because it serves as a physical and functional interface between upstream regulators and the Pol II transcriptional machinery. Nonetheless, its role appears to be context-dependent, and the detailed mechanism by which it governs the expression of most genes remains unknown. Here we investigate Mediator involvement in HSP (heat shock protein) gene regulation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that in response to thermal upshift, subunits representative of each of the four Mediator modules (Head, Middle, Tail, and Kinase) are rapidly, robustly, and selectively recruited to the promoter regions of HSP genes. Their residence is transient, returning to near-background levels within 90 min. Hsf1 (heat shock factor 1) plays a central role in recruiting Mediator, as indicated by the fact that truncation of either its N- or C-terminal activation domain significantly reduces Mediator occupancy, whereas removal of both activation domains abolishes it. Likewise, ablation of either of two Mediator Tail subunits, Med15 or Med16, reduces Mediator recruitment to HSP promoters, whereas deletion of both abolishes it. Accompanying the loss of Mediator, recruitment of RNA polymerase II is substantially diminished. Interestingly, Mediator antagonizes Hsf1 occupancy of non-induced promoters yet facilitates enhanced Hsf1 association with activated ones. Collectively, our observations indicate that Hsf1, via its dual activation domains, recruits holo-Mediator to HSP promoters in response to acute heat stress through cooperative physical and/or functional interactions with the Tail module."

Within white adipose tissue, CTRP11 is primarily expressed by stromal vascular cells. As a secreted multimeric protein, CTRP11 forms disulfide-linked oligomers. Although the conserved N-terminal Cys-28 and Cys-32 are dispensable for the assembly of higher-order oligomeric structures, they are unexpectedly involved in modulating protein secretion.

Here we report on the identification of histone H3K56, located at the pivotal, nucleosome DNA entry/exit point, as a novel methylation site that is evolutionary conserved. We identify trimethylation of H3K56 (H3K56me3) as a modification that is present during all cell cycle phases, with the exception of S-phase, where it is underrepresented on chromatin. H3K56me3 is a novel heterochromatin mark, since it is enriched at pericentromeres but not telomeres and is thereby similar, but not identical, to the localization of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3. Possibly due to H3 sequence similarities, Suv39h enzymes, responsible for trimethylation of H3K9, also affect methylation of H3K56. Similarly, we demonstrate that trimethylation of H3K56 is removed by members of the JMJD2 family of demethylases that also target H3K9me3. Furthermore, we identify and characterize mouse mJmjd2E and its human homolog hKDM4L as novel, functionally active enzymes that catalyze the removal of two methyl groups from trimethylated H3K9 and K56. H3K56me3 is also found in C. elegans, where it co-localizes with H3K9me3 in most, but not all, tissues.

For the initial hydrogen abstraction step, the inherent flexibility of the phosphopantetheine molecule weakens the position dependence for both the native substrate (threonine for SyrB2) and alternative substrates. Over a 5 Å window of substrate positions, the tethered hydrogen abstraction step proceeds with nearly identical activation energies and donor-acceptor distances in the transition state. The propensity of a particular substrate toward halogenation or hydroxylation is found to depend strongly on the substrate placement following hydrogen abstraction, with deeper substrate delivery into the active (for native substrates) site favoring halogenation and shallower substrate delivery favoring hydroxylation."

Rev-erbα is structurally unusual in that it lacks the C-terminal tail (helix 12) of the ligand binding domain, which is required for co-activator recognition, hence functions as a transcriptional repressor (9Lazar M.A. Jones K.E.

Rev-erbα may bind to its response element either as a monomer or as a homodimer. As a monomer, it binds to the consensus nuclear receptor half-site motif flanked by a 6-bp AT-rich sequence (A/T)6 PuGGTCA; as a homodimer, it binds to a direct repeat of the core motif separated by 2 bp (DR2) (10Harding H.P.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis latently infects one-third of the human race with incidences of active cases, which are rising alarmingly in immunocompromised individuals, especially people infected with HIV. Now with an increase in the cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and with the emergence of extremely drug resistant and total drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, tuberculosis has become a major global public health threat. The last decade has seen a hunt for new cellular targets to control and eliminate tuberculosis infection. Nuclear receptors have emerged as decisive cellular targets with the potential of regulating host immune responses to pathogens. Nuclear receptors including PPARγ, testicular receptor 4 (TR4), and LXRs have been shown to effect M. tuberculosis survival or clearance via modulating macrophage function (16Mahajan S. Dkhar H.K. Chandra V. Dave S. Nanduri R. Janmeja A.K. Agrewala J.N. Gupta P. Mycobacterium tuberculosis modulates macrophage lipid-sensing nuclear receptors PPARγ and TR4 for survival.J.

Among cytokines, IL10 is a master regulator of macrophage plasticity and function; it antagonizes the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, blocks the release of proinflammatory cytokines, and inhibits phagolysosome maturation and key events in apoptosis (19O'Leary S.

TNF-α and IL-10 modulate the induction of apoptosis by virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis in murine macrophages.J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6122-6131PubMed Google Scholar). IL10 ameliorates immunopathology and prevents host injury, but also has been reported to impede clearance of several pathogens such as Mycobacterium spp., Plasmodium spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Leishmania major (22Couper K.N. Blount D.G. Riley E.M. IL-10: the master regulator of immunity to infection.J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 5771-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). Despite the pleiotropic effects of IL10, its regulation at the level of signal transduction, epigenetics, and transcription factor binding has been addressed in a limited fashion, mostly in regard to IL10 gene activation (23Saraiva M. O'Garra A. The regulation of IL-10 production by immune cells.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular events and associated transcription factors that constitute basal repression of IL10 is a requirement for design of newer strategies for infectious disease intervention. In this study, we demonstrate that Rev-erbα binds in vitro and in vivo to the human IL10 putative Rev-erbα DR2 response element, which is preceded by an A/T-rich sequence. Rev-erbα forms a repressive complex by associating with NCoR-HDAC3 upon heme binding and keeps IL10 in a basal repressed state. This repression of human IL10 provides microbicidal phenotype characterized by increased phagolysosome maturation and creation of a macrophage niche that reduces survival of the intracellular parasite M. tuberculosis. Further, the proficiency of Rev-erbα to regulate human IL10 selectively and precisely makes it a valuable target for pharmacological exploitation in infection and tumor regression. Thus, this study will allow us to understand a hitherto unknown mechanism for direct gene regulation of human IL10 by Rev-erbα and utilize the ligand binding domain of Rev-erbα to design small molecules with microbicidal properties. THP-1 (National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), India) cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) with 10% FBS (Gibco), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). MG132 (carbobenzoxy-Leu-Leu-leucinal, Sigma). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers by Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation. Recombinant human GM-CSF and M-CSF and cytokines (eBioscience) were used for differentiation of monocytes into macrophages. pCMV-XL5-Rev-erbα construct was supplied by OriGene. Full-length Rev-erbα was PCR-amplified using a forward primer with a ClaI restriction site and a reverse primer with a KpnI restriction site and then cloned into pCMV2-FLAG vector. pAdeno-X cloning of Rev-erbα was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Adenoviral particles were produced, titrated, and stored at −70 °C. pSC301 GFP vector capable of expressing in Mycobacterium sp. and in Escherichia coli was kindly provided by Dr. Yossef Av-Gay. GFP-H37Rv and H37Ra were made by electroporation and selection as described previously (24Cowley S.C. Av-Gay Y. Monitoring promoter activity and protein localization in Mycobacterium spp. using green fluorescent protein.Gene. 2001; 264: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). THP-1 cells obtained from the NCCS and maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin were plated at a density of 1 × 106/well in 6-well plates and stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (30 ng/ml) for 6 h. After 6 h, the medium was replaced by fresh complete RPMI 1640 with PMA plus either IFNγ (20 ng/ml) and LPS (100 ng/ml) or IL4 (20 ng/ml) for another 18 h (supplemental Fig. 1). Cells treated with only PMA were taken as controls. Peripheral blood was drawn from healthy volunteers. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. The isolated mononuclear cells were then resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FCS and plated at 5 × 106 cells/well for 2 h (37 °C/5% CO2) to allow monocyte adherence. After 2 h, nonadherent lymphocytes were removed by PBS washes, and fresh complete medium was then added to the wells. After 24 h, adherent cells were washed with PBS, detached from the wells by scrapping with rubber scrapper, and counted after trypan blue dye staining. The cells (>85% monocytes as determined by flow cytometric analysis after staining with anti-CD14 mAbs) were plated either in 96-well plates at the density of 2 × 105 cells/well or in 12-well plates at the concentration of 1 × 106 cells/well and were cultured for in complete RPMI 1640 along with either GM-CSF (50 ng/ml) for M1-type cells or M-CSF (50 ng/ml) for M2-type cells for 5–6 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2 to promote their full differentiation into monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). After 5–6 days, these MDMs (>95% CD14) were stimulated by IFNγ (50 ng/ml) and LPS (10 ng/ml) or IL4 (50 ng/ml) for another 24 h (supplemental Fig. 2) (25Bouhlel M.A. Derudas B. Rigamonti E.

Overexpression of Rev-erbα was performed by infecting primary human monocyte-derived macrophages with adenoviral particles (500–1000 plaque-forming units/cell) in Opti-MEM for 2–4 h followed by the addition of fresh medium and additional incubation of 24 h. Oligonucleotides were annealed and then end-labeled using T4-polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. pCMV-XL5-Rev-erbα was transcribed in vitro by T7-polymerase and subsequently translated using the TnT-coupled transcription and translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A DNA protein binding assay was performed (27Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Auwerx J. Fibrates increase human apolipoprotein A-II expression through activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor.J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). For all competition experiments, cold oligonucleotides were added after labeled probe. ChIP was performed according to standard protocol (28Wang J. Yin L. Lazar M.A. The orphan nuclear receptor Rev-erbα regulates circadian expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33842-33848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). ChIP and re-ChIP-purified DNA fragments along with input DNA were PCR-amplified using primers specific to putative Rev-erbα response elements on the IL10 promoter (+1 to −350). The following primers were used for the detection of ChIP products: ChFwd IL10, 5′-AAT CAA CTT TTT TTA ATT GAG AAG CT-3′ and ChRev IL10, 5′-GCC TTC TTT TGC AAG TCT GTC T-3′; ChRevDR2(+), forward, 5′-GGT GGA CTA CAA ATC CCG ACA GTC TT-3′ and ChRevDR2(+) reverse, 5′-TGG GAC AGA GGG CTC TGC GC-3′; β-actin forward, 5′-ACT GTT ACC CTC AAA AGC AG-3′ and β-actin reverse, 5′-GTG GGT CAC TAG GGA GAG ACC-3′. M. tuberculosis H37Ra and H37Rv cultures were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco Laboratories) supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 80 (Sigma) and 10% Middlebrook oleic acid albumin dextrose catalase (BD Biosciences) to log phase. Cultures of log phase were used for infection. In brief, cultures were centrifuged for 5 min and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10%FBS. For single bacterial cell preparation, culture was syringe-passed carefully for 20–30 times for 3–5 min and then used for infection. To ascertain the multiplicity of infection, 1 × 106 PMA-treated THP-1 macrophages were infected with different dilutions of bacteria for 4 h and then washed three times with medium to remove any unphagocytosed bacteria. Cells were again incubated for 24 h in complete RPMI medium, and then acid-fast staining or confocal imaging was performed to count the cell-associated mycobacteria (29Riendeau C.J. Kornfeld H. THP-1 cell apoptosis in response to Mycobacterial infection.Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). On the basis of this screening, multiplicity of infection of 1:5 was used for H37Ra and H37Rv infection. At this multiplicity of infection, most macrophages confirmed the presence of 5–10 bacilli per cell. Infected M1-MDMs with knockdown of Rev-erbα or ectopically overexpressed Rev-erbα were lysed with 0.06% SDS after 24 h of incubation, and bacterial suspensions were used with the LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability and counting kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The percentage of live and dead bacteria was determined by flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) after staining with SYTO9 and propidium iodide. For CFU determination, after macrophage solubilization, the bacterial suspensions were serially diluted, 50 μl of each sample was plated, and CFU were counted. Final calculations included the dilution factor and the volume of diluted sample for plating. Anti-IL10 neutralizing antibody (purified Rat anti-human IL10, BD Biosciences) or isotype control was used 30 min prior to infection with H37Ra or H37Rv. Analysis of cell surface marker expression was performed by surface staining of cells at a density of 105 for 30 min at 4 °C by using the appropriate isotype controls with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD86, anti-CD80, anti-CD40, and anti-CD-206 and FITC-conjugated anti-CD-68 (eBioscience/BD Biosciences). Samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Cell culture supernatants were harvested after 36 h of siRNA transfection or 24 h of viral transduction and analyzed for IL10 using a commercial kit (BD Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was isolated by the TRIzol method from macrophages and monocytes, and 1 μg was reverse-transcribed (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's protocol and subsequently amplified by PCR using specific primers. GAPDH mRNA was used as a loading control. The relative abundance of gene was calculated using the formula 2−ΔCT, where ΔCT is calculated as the difference between target gene and GAPDH CT values. For immunoblotting, 40 μg of total protein extract was resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. β-Actin, tubulin, and lamin-B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used as loading controls for the whole cell extract, cytoplasmic fraction, and nuclear fraction. THP-1 cells were treated with PMA (30 ng/ml) and grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. THP-1, PMA-treated THP-1 cells, and transfected PMA-treated THP-1 cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunostaining. Rev-erbα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was stained using mouse-anti-Rev-erbα or mouse anti-FLAG tag followed by Texas Red conjugated with goat-anti-mouse antibody. Tubulin was stained with Tubulin Tracker, and DAPI (Sigma) was used as a nuclear stain. For immunostaining of Rev-erbα in M1-MDM and M2-MDM, goat-anti-mouse FITC was used as secondary antibody. For co-localization of mycobacteria with lysosomes, GFP-H37Ra and GFP-H37Rv were used to infect macrophages. Cells were then incubated for another 24 h followed by the addition of 100 nm LysoTracker for 30 min at 37 °C and fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. The coverslips were washed thoroughly with PBS and mounted on slides with antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes). The stained cells were observed with an LSM 510 Meta Carl Zeiss confocal microscope and Nikon A1R confocal microscope. The co-localization of LysoTracker and GFP-H37Ra and H37Rv was quantified by selecting a region of interest and determining the overlap coefficient (30Manders E.M.M. Verbeek F.J. Aten J.A. Measurement of co-localization of objects in dual-colour confocal images.J. Microscopy. 1993; 169: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). For total reactive oxygen species measurement, the cells were incubated with 10 μm DHR123 probe for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were harvested and subjected to flow cytometry to determine the levels of reactive oxygen species. The project was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, Chandigarh, India (GMCH/TA-1 [19]/2011/Agenda Number 2) and Ethics and Biosafety Committee of the Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), Sector 39A, Chandigarh, India (01/2011/IMT/IEC-Blood; 12/2010IMT/IBSC). The study was conducted strictly in accordance with the Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research on Human Subjects by the Central Ethics Committee on Human Research, Indian Council of Medical Research-2000 and those as contained in the Declaration of Helsinki. Each subject was provided with written information about the study, and written consent on the consent form was obtained from each healthy volunteer prior to his/her induction in the study. Information to healthy volunteers and consent forms were in languages (English, Hindi, and Punjabi) familiar to the volunteers. Rev-erbα has been shown to express in various cell types. It can modulate adipocyte and myocyte differentiation, which led us to question of whether Rev-erbα affects monocyte differentiation to macrophages. THP-1 (THP-1 cells treated with PMA) macrophages are a very well recognized and widely used model for a differentiated tissue macrophage that closely resembles native monocyte-derived macrophage differentiation (supplemental Fig. 1). This model system was utilized to first investigate the localization of Rev-erbα in both monocytes and macrophages. Interestingly, subcellular localization patterns were found to be distinct. In monocytes, Rev-erbα was exclusively cytoplasmic, whereas in macrophages, it was predominantly nuclear; this discrete subcellular localization of Rev-erbα in monocytes and macrophages was confirmed by confocal microscopy and immunoblotting (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 3A). Ectopic expression of Rev-erbα in monocytes and differentiated macrophages led to a similar localization pattern (Fig. 1B). Noise-to-signal ratio was ascertained for anti-Rev-erbα antibody by staining the cells with Rev-erbα knockdown background. Using FACS analysis, we determined surface expression of macrophage differentiation marker CD68, co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, and CD40 in THP-1 monocytes and THP-1 derived macrophages in Rev-erbα knockdown backgrounds and compared them with a THP-1 macrophage control (Fig. 1C). Upon silencing Rev-erbα in THP-1-derived macrophages, no change in expression of differentiation marker or co-stimulatory molecule was observed, suggesting that Rev-erbα had no effect on PMA-induced THP-1 monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation or activation (Fig. 1C). There was a striking difference in the abundance of Rev-erbα in M1- and M2-polarized THP-1 macrophages, with less Rev-erbα (mRNA and protein) present in the alternative M2 macrophages (Fig. 1D, upper and middle panel). Further, to determine whether proteasomal activity is involved in this difference at the level of both transcription and protein stability, PMA-induced THP-1 cells and M1- and M2-polarized THP-1 macrophages were treated with MG132, a specific inhibitor of 26 S proteasome. Noticeably, MG132 promoted Rev-erbα accumulation in M2-polarized THP-1 macrophages as evident by ubiquitination of Rev-erbα in M2- but not M1-polarized THP-1 macrophages (Fig. 1D, lower panel and supplemental Fig. 3B). To corroborate the findings in the primary cells, human MDMs were utilized, and an endogenous Rev-erbα staining was performed as mentioned above (Fig. 1E and supplemental Fig. 3C). A similar observation of nuclear localization of Rev-erbα was also found in MDMs. Also, real-time PCR analysis of Rev-erbα mRNA expression was performed on human MDMs programmed into M1 and M2 macrophages (supplemental Fig. 3D).Thus, cytoplasmic localization of Rev-erbα, a nuclear receptor, explains its inability to modulate monocyte-macrophage differentiation, but its nuclear localization after differentiation suggests that it may regulate some of the genes and modulate macrophage function. Our previous study has illustrated the role of nuclear receptors in modulating macrophage effector functions in mycobacterial clearance and survival (16Mahajan S. Dkhar H.K. Chandra V. Dave S. Nanduri R. Janmeja A.K. Agrewala J.N. Gupta P. Mycobacterium tuberculosis modulates macrophage lipid-sensing nuclear receptors PPARγ and TR4 for survival.J. Immunol. 2012; 188: 5593-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Given that Rev-erbα finds enhanced expression in bactericidal M1 macrophages, we investigated its antimycobacterial role. We employed an RNAi approach to knock down Rev-erbα in M1 macrophages followed by infection with avirulent M. tuberculosi"

People who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing (Deaf/HH) and older adults are particularly vulnerable during health emergencies and require communications that are accessible and understandable. Although health literacy studies indicate that the readability of health communication materials often exceeds people’s literacy levels, we could find no research about the readability of emergency preparedness materials (EPM) intended for Deaf/HH and older adult populations. The objective of this study was to explore issues related to EPM for Deaf/HH and older adult populations, to assess the availability and readability of materials for these populations, and to recommend improvements. In two California counties, we interviewed staff at 14 community-based organizations (CBOs) serving Deaf/HH clients and 20 CBOs serving older adults selected from a stratified, random sample of 227 CBOs. We collected 40 EPM from 10 CBOs and 2 public health departments and 40 EPM from 14 local and national websites with EPM for the public. We used computerized assessments to test the U.S. grade reading levels of the 16 eligible CBO and health department EPM, and the 18 eligible website materials. Results showed that less than half of CBOs had EPM for their clients. All EPM intended for clients of Deaf/HH-serving CBOs tested above the recommended 4th grade reading level, and 91% of the materials intended for clients of older adult-serving CBOs scored above the recommended 6th grade level. EPM for these populations should be widely available through CBOs and public health departments, adhere to health literacy principles, and be accessible in alternative formats including American Sign Language. Developers should engage the intended users of EPM as co-designers and testers. This study adds to the limited literature about EPM for these populations."
https://openalex.org/W2084283959,"Chitoporin (VhChiP) is a sugar-specific channel responsible for the transport of chitooligosaccharides through the outer membrane of the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi. Single channel reconstitution into black lipid membrane allowed single chitosugar binding events in the channel to be resolved. VhChiP has an exceptionally high substrate affinity, with a binding constant of K = 5.0 × 10(6) M(-1) for its best substrate (chitohexaose). The on-rates of chitosugars depend on applied voltages, as well as the side of the sugar addition, clearly indicating the inherent asymmetry of the VhChiP lumen. The binding affinity of VhChiP for chitohexaose is 1-5 orders of magnitude larger than that of other known sugar-specific porins for their preferred substrates. Thus, VhChiP is the most potent sugar-specific channel reported to date, with its high efficiency presumably reflecting the need for the bacterium to take up chitin-containing nutrients promptly under turbulent aquatic conditions to exploit them efficiently as its sole source of energy."
https://openalex.org/W2080452727,"Background In areas of widespread sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance, intermittent treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) fails to prevent placental malaria (PM) and may exacerbate drug resistant infections. Because PM predicts increased susceptibility to parasitemia during infancy, we hypothesized that IPTp would also increase susceptibility to malaria infection and disease in the offspring. Methods In a birth cohort from NE Tanzania, we evaluated the association between maternal IPTp use and risk of parasitemia and severe malaria in the offspring. Using Cox Proportional Hazards Models as well as Generalized Estimating Equations, we evaluated the effects of IPTp on the entire cohort and on subgroups stratified by PM status at delivery. Results and Conclusions Offspring of PM+ women who received IPTp had a dose-dependent decrease in time to first parasitemia (AHR = 2.13, p = 0.04 [95%CI: 1.04, 4.38]). Among all offspring, IPTp was associated with earlier first severe malaria episode (AHR = 2.32, p = 0.02 [95%CI: 1.12, 4.78]) as well as increased overall odds of severe malaria (AOR = 2.31, p = 0.03 [95%CI: 1.09, 4.88]). Cost-benefit analyses of IPTp regimens should consider the long term effects on offspring in addition to pregnancy outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2011258780,"Research using electronic health records (EHRs) relies heavily on coded clinical data. Due to variation in coding practices, it can be difficult to aggregate the codes for a condition in order to define cases. This paper describes a methodology to develop 'indicator markers' found in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA); these are a broader range of codes which may allow a probabilistic case definition to use in cases where no diagnostic code is yet recorded.We examined EHRs of 5,843 patients in the General Practice Research Database, aged ≥ 30 y, with a first coded diagnosis of RA between 2005 and 2008. Lists of indicator markers for RA were developed initially by panels of clinicians drawing up code-lists and then modified based on scrutiny of available data. The prevalence of indicator markers, and their temporal relationship to RA codes, was examined in patients from 3 y before to 14 d after recorded RA diagnosis.Indicator markers were common throughout EHRs of RA patients, with 83.5% having 2 or more markers. 34% of patients received a disease-specific prescription before RA was coded; 42% had a referral to rheumatology, and 63% had a test for rheumatoid factor. 65% had at least one joint symptom or sign recorded and in 44% this was at least 6-months before recorded RA diagnosis.Indicator markers of RA may be valuable for case definition in cases which do not yet have a diagnostic code. The clinical diagnosis of RA is likely to occur some months before it is coded, shown by markers frequently occurring ≥ 6 months before recorded diagnosis. It is difficult to differentiate delay in diagnosis from delay in recording. Information concealed in free text may be required for the accurate identification of patients and to assess the quality of care in general practice."
https://openalex.org/W2048566951,"The chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its chemokine CXCL12 are involved in normal tissue patterning but also in tumor cell growth and survival as well as in the recruitment of immune and inflammatory cells, as successfully demonstrated using agents that block either CXCL12 or CXCR4. In order to achieve selectivity in drug action on the CXCR4/CXCL12 pair, in particular in the airways, drugs should be delivered as selectively as possible in the treated tissue and should not diffuse in the systemic circulation, where it may reach undesired organs. To this end, we used a previously unexploited Knoevenagel reaction to create a short lived drug, or soft drug, based on the CXCL12-neutralizing small molecule, chalcone 4, which blocks binding of CXCL12 to CXCR4. We show that the compound, carbonitrile-chalcone 4, blocks the recruitment of eosinophils to the airways in ovalbumin-sensitized and challenged mice in vivo when administered directly to the airways by the intranasal route, but not when administered systemically by the intraperitoneal route. We show that the lack of effect at a distant site is due to the rapid degradation of the molecule to inactive fragments. This approach allows selective action of the CXCL12 neutraligands although the target protein is widely distributed in the organism."
https://openalex.org/W2052065737,"The Strait of Gibraltar replenishes the Mediterranean with Atlantic waters through an intense eastward current known as the Atlantic Jet (AJ). The AJ fertilizes the southwestern Mediterranean and is considered to be the ultimate factor responsible for the comparatively high fish production of this region. Here, we perform an analysis of the available historical catches and catch per unit effort (CPUE), together with a long series of surface currents, kinetic energy and chlorophyll concentration. We show that the high kinetic energy of the AJ increases primary production but also negatively impacts the recruitment of anchovy. We contend that anchovy recruitment in the region is inhibited by the advection and dispersion of larvae and post-larvae during periods of strong advection by the AJ. The inhibitory impact of kinetic energy on anchovy landings is not a transient but rather a persistent state of the system. An exceptional combination of events creates an outbreak of this species in the Alboran Sea. These events depend on the Mediterranean-Atlantic exchange of water masses and, therefore, are highly sensitive to climate changes that are projected, though not always negatively, for fish landings."
https://openalex.org/W2002839242,"Background Patients with chronic kidney disease have an increased cardiovascular risk that is not fully explained by traditional risk factors but appears to be related to increased arterial stiffness. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is associated with increased cardiovascular risk although the mechanisms for this are unknown. We examined whether CMV seropositivity was associated with increased arterial stiffness in patients with chronic kidney disease. Methodology and Principal Findings In 215 non-diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease, CMV seropositivity was determined using an anti-CMV IgG ELISA. Pulse wave velocity was measured and aortic distensibility assessed in the ascending, proximal descending and distal descending thoracic aorta. Patients seropositive for CMV had a higher pulse wave velocity and lower aortic distensibility at all 3 levels. These differences (except for ascending aortic distensibility) persisted in a subcohort matched for age, gender and renal function, and when the whole cohort was divided into quartiles of age. In multivariable analyses, CMV seropositivity was an independent determinant of pulse wave velocity and proximal and distal descending aortic distensibility. Conclusions In patients with chronic kidney disease, CMV seropositivity is associated with increased arterial stiffness and decreased distensibility of the proximal descending and distal aorta. These findings suggest that further research is required to examine CMV as a possible cause of arterial disease and increased cardiovascular risk in patients with CKD and may be relevant more widely for CMV seropositive patients with normal renal function."
https://openalex.org/W2024631223,"The ability to recognize kin and thus behaviourally discriminate between conspecifics based on genetic relatedness is of importance both in acquiring inclusive fitness benefits and to enable optimal inbreeding. In primates, mechanisms allowing recognition of paternal relatives are of particular interest, given that in these mating systems patrilineal information is unlikely to be available via social familiarity. Humans use visual phenotype matching based on facial features to identify their own and other's close relatives, and recent studies suggest similar abilities may be present in other species. However it is unclear to what extent familial resemblances remain detectable against the background levels of relatedness typically found within demes in the wild – a necessary condition if facial cues are to function in kin recognition under natural conditions. Here, we experimentally investigate whether parent-offspring relationships are discernible in rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) faces drawn from a large free-ranging population more representative of the latter scenario, and in which genetic relatedness has been well quantified from pedigrees determined via molecular markers. We used the human visual system as a means of integrating multiple types of facial cue simultaneously, and demonstrate that paternal, as well as maternal, resemblance to both sons and daughters can be detected even by human observers. Experts performed better than participants who lacked previous experience working with nonhuman primates. However the finding that even naïve individuals succeeded at the task underlines the strength of the phenotypic cues present in faces."

We characterized the Ufm1 cascade of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans in terms of function and analyzed interactions of the involved proteins in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we investigated the phenotypes of the deletion mutants uba5(ok3364) (activating enzyme of Ufm1) and ufc1(tm4888) (conjugating enzyme of Ufm1). The viable deletion mutants showed a decrease in reproduction, development, life span, and a reduced survival under heavy metal stress. However, an increased survival rate under pathogenic, oxidative, heat, and endoplasmic reticulum stress was observed. We propose that the Ufm1 cascade negatively regulates the IRE1-mediated unfolded protein response."
https://openalex.org/W2138249625,"The potent inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is implicated in the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory conditions, including periodontitis. The inducible enzyme microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), catalyzing the terminal step of PGE2 biosynthesis, is an attractive target for selective PGE2 inhibition. To identify mPGES-1 inhibitors, we investigated the effect of aminothiazoles on inflammation-induced PGE2 synthesis in vitro, using human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with the cytokine IL-1β and a cell-free mPGES-1 activity assay, as well as on inflammation-induced bone resorption in vivo, using ligature-induced experimental periodontitis in Sprague-Dawley rats. Aminothiazoles 4-([4-(2-naphthyl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]amino)phenol (TH-848) and 4-(3-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)-N-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1,3-thiazol-2-amine (TH-644) reduced IL-1β-induced PGE2 production in fibroblasts (IC50 1.1 and 1.5 μM, respectively) as well as recombinant mPGES-1 activity, without affecting activity or expression of the upstream enzyme cyclooxygenase-2. In ligature-induced experimental periodontitis, alveolar bone loss, assessed by X-ray imaging, was reduced by 46% by local treatment with TH-848, compared to vehicle, without any systemic effects on PGE2, 6-keto PGF1α, LTB4 or cytokine levels. In summary, these results demonstrate that the aminothiazoles represent novel mPGES-1 inhibitors for inhibition of PGE2 production and reduction of bone resorption in experimental periodontitis, and may be used as potential anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, including periodontitis.—Kats, A., Båge, T., Georgsson, P., Jönsson, J., Quezada, H.

https://openalex.org/W2038325264,"Interactions that facilitate transmembrane domain (TMD) dimerization have been identified mainly using synthetic TMDs. Here, we investigated how inherent properties within natural TMDs modulate their interaction strength by exploiting the sequence variation in the nine neuraminidase subtypes (N1-N9) and the prior knowledge that a N1 TMD oligomerizes. Initially, consensus TMDs were created from the influenza A virus database, and their interaction strengths were measured in a biological membrane system. The TMD interactions increased with respect to decreasing hydrophobicity across the subtypes (N1-N9) and within the human N1 subtype where the N1 TMDs from the pandemic H1N1 strain of swine origin were found to be significantly less hydrophobic. The hydrophobicity correlation was attributed to the conserved amphipathicity within the TMDs as the interactions were abolished by mutating residues on the polar faces that are unfavorably positioned in the membrane. Similarly, local changes enhanced the interactions only when a larger polar residue existed on the appropriate face in an unfavorable membrane position. Together, the analysis of this unique natural TMD data set demonstrates how polar-mediated TMD interactions from bitopic proteins depend on which polar residues are involved and their positioning with respect to the helix and the membrane bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1966014760,"Positron emission tomography with [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) plays a well-established role in assisting early detection of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Here, we examined the impact of intensity normalization to different reference areas on accuracy of FDG-PET to discriminate between patients with mild FTLD and healthy elderly subjects. FDG-PET was conducted at two centers using different acquisition protocols: 41 FTLD patients and 42 controls were studied at center 1, 11 FTLD patients and 13 controls were studied at center 2. All PET images were intensity normalized to the cerebellum, primary sensorimotor cortex (SMC), cerebral global mean (CGM), and a reference cluster with most preserved FDG uptake in the aforementioned patients group of center 1. Metabolic deficits in the patient group at center 1 appeared 1.5, 3.6, and 4.6 times greater in spatial extent, when tracer uptake was normalized to the reference cluster rather than to the cerebellum, SMC, and CGM, respectively. Logistic regression analyses based on normalized values from FTLD-typical regions showed that at center 1, cerebellar, SMC, CGM, and cluster normalizations differentiated patients from controls with accuracies of 86%, 76%, 75% and 90%, respectively. A similar order of effects was found at center 2. Cluster normalization leads to a significant increase of statistical power in detecting early FTLD-associated metabolic deficits. The established FTLD-specific cluster can be used to improve detection of FTLD on a single case basis at independent centers – a decisive step towards early diagnosis and prediction of FTLD syndromes enabling specific therapies in the future."

Flavin-containing compounds are essential cofactors that are required for metabolic processes in all living organisms, and riboflavin is a direct precursor of the cofactors FMN and FAD. Unlike many pathogenic bacteria, Treponema pallidum cannot synthesize riboflavin; we recently described a flavin-uptake mechanism composed of an ABC-type transporter. However, there is a paucity of information about flavin utilization in bacterial periplasms. Using a discovery-driven approach, we have identified the TP0796 lipoprotein as a previously uncharacterized Mg2+-dependent FAD pyrophosphatase within the ApbE superfamily. TP0796 probably plays a central role in flavin turnover by hydrolyzing exogenously acquired FAD, yielding AMP and FMN.

https://openalex.org/W2164696627,"Previous work has shown that disruption of the gene for group X secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-X) markedly diminishes airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling in a mouse asthma model. With the large number of additional sPLA2s in the mammalian genome, the involvement of other sPLA2s in the asthma model is possible - in particular, the group V sPLA2 (sPLA2-V) that like sPLA2-X is highly active at hydrolyzing membranes of mammalian cells.The allergen-driven asthma phenotype was significantly reduced in sPLA2-V-deficient mice but to a lesser extent than observed previously in sPLA2-X-deficient mice. The most striking difference observed between the sPLA2-V and sPLA2-X knockouts was the significant impairment of the primary immune response to the allergen ovalbumin (OVA) in the sPLA2-V(-/-) mice. The impairment in eicosanoid generation and dendritic cell activation in sPLA2-V(-/-) mice diminishes Th2 cytokine responses in the airways.This paper illustrates the diverse roles of sPLA2s in the immunopathogenesis of the asthma phenotype and directs attention to developing specific inhibitors of sPLA2-V as a potential new therapy to treat asthma and other allergic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2019397229,"Kleine Levin Syndrome (KLS) is a rare disorder of periodic hypersomnia and behavioural disturbances in young individuals. It has previously been shown to be associated with disturbances of working memory (WM), which, in turn, was associated with higher activation of the thalamus with increasing WM load, demonstrated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this study we aimed to further elucidate how these findings are related to the metabolism of the thalamus.fMRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy were applied while performing a WM task. Standard metabolites were examined: n-acetylaspartate (NAA), myo-inositol, choline, creatine and glutamate-glutamine. Fourteen KLS-patients and 15 healthy controls participated in the study. The patients with active disease were examined in asymptomatic periods.There was a statistically significant negative correlation between thalamic fMRI-activation and thalamic NAA, i.e., high fMRI-activation corresponded to low NAA-levels. This correlation was not seen in healthy controls. Thalamic levels of NAA in patients and controls showed no significant differences between the groups. None of the other metabolites showed any co-variation with fMRI-activation.This study shows negative correlation between NAA-levels and fMRI-activity in the left thalamus of KLS-patients while performing a WM task. This correlation could not be found in healthy control subjects, primarily interpreted as an effect of increased effort in the patient group upon performing the task. It might indicate a disturbance in the neuronal networks responsible for WM in KLS patients, resulting in higher effort at lower WM load, compared with healthy subjects. The general relationship between NAA and BOLD-signal is also discussed in the article."
https://openalex.org/W2143843311,"The Syk protein-tyrosine kinase can have multiple effects on cancer cells, acting in some as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting motility and in others as a tumor promoter by enhancing survival. Phosphoproteomic analyses identified PKA as a Syk-specific substrate. Syk catalyzes the phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc) both in vitro and in cells on Tyr-330. Tyr-330 lies within the adenosine-binding motif in the C-terminal tail of PKAc within a cluster of acidic amino acids (DDYEEEE), which is a characteristic of Syk substrates. The phosphorylation of PKAc on Tyr-330 by Syk strongly inhibits its catalytic activity. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that this additional negative charge prevents the C-terminal tail from interacting with the substrate and the nucleotide-binding site to stabilize the closed conformation of PKAc, thus preventing catalysis from occurring. Phosphoproteomic analyses and Western blotting studies indicate that Tyr-330 can be phosphorylated in a Syk-dependent manner in MCF7 breast cancer cells and DT40 B cells. The phosphorylation of a downstream substrate of PKAc, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), is inhibited in cells expressing Syk but can be rescued by a selective inhibitor of Syk. Modulation of CREB activity alters the expression of the CREB-regulated gene BCL2 and modulates cellular responses to genotoxic agents. Thus, PKA is a novel substrate of Syk, and its phosphorylation on Tyr-330 inhibits its participation in downstream signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2005777533,"Cyanobacteria have evolved to survive stressful environmental changes by regulating growth, however, the underlying mechanism for this is obscure. The ability of chromosomal type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems to modulate growth or cell death has been documented in a variety of prokaryotes. A chromosomal mazEaFa locus of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 has been predicted as a putative mazEF TA system. Here we demonstrate that mazEaFa form a bicistronic operon that is co-transcribed under normal growth conditions. Overproduction of MazFa induced Anabaena growth arrest which could be neutralized by co-expression of MazEa. MazFa also inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli cells, and this effect could be overcome by simultaneous or subsequent expression of MazEa via formation of the MazEa-MazFa complex in vivo, further confirming the nature of the mazEaFa locus as a type II TA system. Interestingly, like most TA systems, deletion of mazEaFa had no effect on the growth of Anabaena during the tested stresses. Our data suggest that mazEaFa, or together with other chromosomal type II TA systems, may promote cells to cope with particular stresses by inducing reversible growth arrest of Anabaena."
https://openalex.org/W2016887743,"Interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) encodes a highly conserved helix-turn-helix DNA binding protein and is a member of the interferon regulatory family of DNA transcription factors. Mutations in IRF6 lead to isolated and syndromic forms of cleft lip and palate, most notably Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) and Popliteal Ptyerigium Syndrome (PPS). Mice lacking both copies of Irf6 have severe limb, skin, palatal and esophageal abnormalities, due to significantly altered and delayed epithelial development. However, a recent report showed that MCS9.7, an enhancer near Irf6, is active in the tongue, suggesting that Irf6 may also be expressed in the tongue. Indeed, we detected Irf6 staining in the mesoderm-derived muscle during development of the tongue. Dual labeling experiments demonstrated that Irf6 was expressed only in the Myf5+ cell lineage, which originates from the segmental paraxial mesoderm and gives rise to the muscles of the tongue. Fate mapping of the segmental paraxial mesoderm cells revealed a cell-autonomous Irf6 function with reduced and poorly organized Myf5+ cell lineage in the tongue. Molecular analyses showed that the Irf6-/- embryos had aberrant cytoskeletal formation of the segmental paraxial mesoderm in the tongue. Fate mapping of the cranial neural crest cells revealed non-cell-autonomous Irf6 function with the loss of the inter-molar eminence. Loss of Irf6 function altered Bmp2, Bmp4, Shh, and Fgf10 signaling suggesting that these genes are involved in Irf6 signaling. Based on these data, Irf6 plays important cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous roles in muscular differentiation and cytoskeletal formation in the tongue."
https://openalex.org/W2008457692,"Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that elderly patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) can benefit from chemotherapy, yet compliance in real-world practice is low. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy, compliance and reasons for refusal of postoperative chemotherapy for elderly patients with CRC and to provide corresponding strategies.The clinico-pathological and biochemical data of the chemotherapy group and chemo-refusing group were compared among 386 elderly patients (>70 years old) with CRC who underwent surgery. 226 patients received chemotherapy and 160 patients refused. Follow-up of the subjective reasons for refusal was investigated using the elderly caner patients' chemo-refusal reason questionnaire (ECPCRRQ) prepared by the authors and a group of psychologists. The questionnaire is administrated by telephone. A predictive model for 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and 5-year overall survival (OS) was constructed by using Kaplan-Meier analysis, logistic and Cox regression.Among stage III patients, receiving chemotherapy was associated with a significantly higher OS (68%) compared to those who refused ( OS 50%) (HR: 2.05, 95%CI: 1.12-3.77, P = 0.02). The Chemo-refusal group had more female and elderly patients, significantly higher rate of severe complications, and lower body mass index (BMI). Follow-up phone questionnaire analysis showed the doctors' uncertainty of chemotherapy benefit, economic difficulties, uncomfortable feeling, superstition of Traditional Chinese Medicine, concealing information and lack of social support were the main factors for elderly CRC patients to decline chemotherapy.The receipt of post-operative chemotherapy in elderly patients with resected stage III CRC was associated with a more favorable survival. The low compliance rate (160/386) of postoperative chemotherapy was influenced by various subjective and objective factors."

In this study, microarray data from our previous study was combined with HIV-1 latency and LTNP data obtained from NCBI GEO database. Principal variance component analysis and hierarchical clustering verified the removal of batch effect across platform. The analysis revealed a total of 456 differential expressed genes with >2-fold change and B-statistic >0. Bayesian inference was used to reconstitute the transcriptional network of HIV-1 latency or LTNP, respectively. Gene regulation was reprogrammed under different disease condition. By network interference, KPNA2 and ATP5G3 were identified as the hubs in latency network which mediate nuclear export and RNA processing. These data offer comparative insights into HIV-1 latency, which will facilitate the understanding of the genetic basis of HIV-1 latency in vivo and serve as a clue for future treatment dealing with key targets in HIV-1 latency."
https://openalex.org/W2146196755,"Iron (Fe) deficiency is endemic worldwide. Little data are available regarding acute effects of dietary protein on intestinal Fe absorption. The current study evaluated the short-term effects of increasing dietary protein on Fe absorption and expression of genes involved in Fe homeostasis. Sprague Dawley rats (24, female) were randomly assigned to custom-formulated isocaloric diets containing 40, 20 (control), or 5% protein (as percentage of total kilocalories) for 7 d. Whole-body Fe balance studies demonstrated that Fe retention was greater in the 40% group than in the 5% group (30.8 vs. 7.3%; P<0.01). In a separate study utilizing stable iron isotopes, the 40% group absorbed 30% of ingested Fe, while the 20% group absorbed 18% (P=0.005). Whole-genome profiling revealed that increasing dietary protein from 5 to 40% increased duodenal transcript expression of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) 3.2-fold, duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb) 1.8-fold, and transferrin receptor (TfR) 1.8-fold. Consistent with these findings, DMT1 transcript expression was 4-fold higher in RNA prepared from duodenal mucosa in the 40% group compared to the 20% group (P<0.001). These data suggest that increasing dietary protein increases intestinal Fe absorption in part by up-regulating DMT1, Dcytb, and TfR."
https://openalex.org/W2052819945,"Social networks can be organized into communities of closely connected nodes, a property known as modularity. Because diseases, information, and behaviors spread faster within communities than between communities, understanding modularity has broad implications for public policy, epidemiology and the social sciences. Explanations for community formation in social networks often incorporate the attributes of individual people, such as gender, ethnicity or shared activities. High modularity is also a property of large-scale social networks, where each node represents a population of individuals at a location, such as call flow between mobile phone towers. However, whether or not place-based attributes, including land cover and economic activity, can predict community membership for network nodes in large-scale networks remains unknown. We describe the pattern of modularity in a mobile phone communication network in the Dominican Republic, and use a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to determine whether geographic context can explain community membership. Our results demonstrate that place-based attributes, including sugar cane production, urbanization, distance to the nearest airport, and wealth, correctly predicted community membership for over 70% of mobile phone towers. We observed a strongly positive correlation (r = 0.97) between the modularity score and the predictive ability of the LDA, suggesting that place-based attributes can accurately represent the processes driving modularity. In the absence of social network data, the methods we present can be used to predict community membership over large scales using solely place-based attributes."
https://openalex.org/W2080001653,"Survivin is an essential component of the chromosomal passenger complex and a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis family. It is expressed at high levels in a large variety of malignancies, where it has been implicated in drug resistance. It was also shown previously that survivin is up-regulated during telomerase-mediated immortalization, which occurs at a relatively early stage during carcinogenesis. This study shows that up-regulation of survivin during immortalization of human myofibroblasts is an indirect consequence of the repression of p16(INK4a). Survivin and p16(INK4a) were functionally linked by assays that showed that either the up-regulation of survivin or repression of p16(INK4a) rendered telomerase-transduced MRC-5 myofibroblasts resistant to oxidative stress. Conversely, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of survivin activated caspases and enhanced the sensitivity of immortal MRC-5 cells to oxidative stress. The E2F1 transcription factor, which is negatively regulated by the pRB/p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor pathway, was implicated in the up-regulation of survivin. Using the ChIP assay, it was shown that E2F1 directly interacted with the survivin gene (BIRC5) promoter in cells that spontaneously silenced p16(INK4a) during telomerase-mediated immortalization. E2F1 binding to the BIRC5 was also enhanced in telomerase-transduced cells subjected to shRNA-mediated repression of p16(INK4a). Together, these data show that repression of p16(INK4a) contributes to the up-regulation of survivin and thereby provides a survival advantage to cells exposed to oxidative stress during immortalization. The up-regulation of survivin during immortalization likely contributes to the vulnerability of immortal cells to transformation by oncogenes that alter intracellular redox state."
https://openalex.org/W2125106550,"Human and mouse marapsins (Prss27) are serine proteases preferentially expressed by stratified squamous epithelia. However, mouse marapsin contains a transmembrane anchor absent from the human enzyme. To gain insights into physical forms, activities, inhibition, and roles in epithelial differentiation, we traced tail loss in human marapsin to a nonsense mutation in an ancestral ape, compared substrate preferences of mouse and human marapsins with those of the epithelial peptidase prostasin, designed a selective substrate and inhibitor, and generated Prss27-null mice. Phylogenetic analysis predicts that most marapsins are transmembrane proteins. However, nonsense mutations caused membrane anchor loss in three clades: human/bonobo/chimpanzee, guinea pig/degu/tuco-tuco/mole rat, and cattle/yak. Most marapsin-related proteases, including prostasins, are type I transmembrane proteins, but the closest relatives (prosemins) are not. Soluble mouse and human marapsins are tryptic with subsite preferences distinct from those of prostasin, lack general proteinase activity, and unlike prostasins resist antiproteases, including leupeptin, aprotinin, serpins, and α2-macroglobulin, suggesting the presence of non-canonical active sites. Prss27-null mice develop normally in barrier conditions and are fertile without overt epithelial defects, indicating that marapsin does not play critical, non-redundant roles in development, reproduction, or epithelial differentiation. In conclusion, marapsins are conserved, inhibitor-resistant, tryptic peptidases. Although marapsins are type I transmembrane proteins in their typical form, they mutated independently into anchorless forms in several mammalian clades, including one involving humans. Similar pathways appear to have been traversed by prosemins and tryptases, suggesting that mutational tail loss is an important means of evolving new functions of tryptic serine proteases from transmembrane ancestors."

Awarded during a special ceremony by the president, these medals represent the highest honors bestowed by the United States government on scientists and engineers. In his address during the White House awards ceremony in the fall of 2011, President Obama noted that nine of the 12 honorees were born outside of the U.S. (1). The winners came to the U.S., he said, because “America is the best place in the world to do the work they do.” At a time when immigration counts as an issue of pressing political currency, the importance of foreign-born scientists to the U.S. biomedical research enterprise bears repeating: the proportion of foreign-born researchers among recipients of high honors bestowed on American scientists typically exceeds the percentage of foreign-born people living in the U.S., which—including undocumented aliens—hovers around 13% of the general population (2). In fact, at least one in three scientists honored with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for work done in the U.S. during the past century was born outside of the country (3). The United States is a nation of immigrants, and most Americans are proud of their ancestral roots. Nevertheless, a significant portion of the populace subscribes to the view that new immigrants are a burden on the country’s economy. To raise public awareness of the invaluable contribution of immigrants to science in America, the Vilcek Foundation initiated an annual program of prizes to recognize accomplished foreign-born biomedical scientists who are widely regarded as leaders in their fields (Table 1). Currently, each of these prizes includes a cash award of $100,000 (3–5). To recognize a younger generation of distinguished immigrant scientists, the Vilcek Foundation established annual Prizes for Creative Promise in 2009; to be eligible, applicants must be 38 years of age or younger (4–5). In 2013, three winners of the Prize for Creative Promise in Biomedical Science were selected, and each winner was awarded a cash prize of $35,000 (Table 2). Similarly, the Vilcek Foundation (5) confers annual prizes on prominent, foreign-born artists for outstanding achievement in various artistic endeavors. This year, the Vilcek Prize in Biomedical Science is shared by immunologists Richard Flavell and Ruslan Medzhitov, both Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators in the Department of Immunobiology at Yale University."
