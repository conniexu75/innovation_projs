https://openalex.org/W2060453905,"True polar wander, the shifting of the entire mantle relative to the earth's spin axis, has been reanalyzed. Over the last 200 million years, true polar wander has been fast (approximately 5 centimeters per year) most of the time, except for a remarkable standstill from 170 to 110 million years ago. This standstill correlates with a decrease in the reversal frequency of the geomagnetic field and episodes of continental breakup. Conversely, true polar wander is high when reversal frequency increases. It is proposed that intermittent convection modulates the thickness of a thermal boundary layer at the base of the mantle and consequently the core-to-mantle heat flux. Emission of hot thermals from the boundary layer leads to increases in mantle convection and true polar wander. In conjunction, cold thermals released from a boundary layer at the top of the liquid core eventually lead to reversals. Changes in the locations of subduction zones may also affect true polar wander. Exceptional volcanism and mass extinctions at the Cretaceous-Tertiary and Permo-Triassic boundaries may be related to thermals released after two unusually long periods with no magnetic reversals. These environmental catastrophes may therefore be a consequence of thermal and chemical couplings in the earth's multilayer heat engine rather than have an extraterrestrial cause."
https://openalex.org/W2166191734,"Transgenic plants are generated in nature by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a pathogen that produces disease through the transfer of some of its own DNA into susceptible plants. The genes are carried on a plasmid. Much has been learned about how the plasmid is transferred, how the plasmid-borne genes are organized, regulated, and expressed, and how the bacteria's pathogenic effects are produced. The A. tumefaciens plasmid has been manipulated for use as a general vector for the transfer of specific segments of foreign DNA of interest (from plants and other sources) into plants; the activities of various genes and their regulation by enhancer and silencer sequences have been assessed. Future uses of the vector (or others like it that have different host ranges) by the agriculture industry are expected to aid in moving into vulnerable plants specific genes that will protect them from such killers as nonselective herbicides, insects, and viruses."

The discovery itself and its early confirmation are summarized, including the work until the beginning of 1987. The observation of a superconductive glass state in percolative samples is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2004758239,Sulfur released from any given natural or anthropogenic source carries an isotopic signature that can be used to trace its flow through the environment. Measurements of the concentration and isotopic composition of sulfur in weekly bulk precipitation samples collected over a 4-year period at a remote location in northern Ontario were recorded. The long-term isotopic data and the measurement on the production and release of dimethyl sulfide from boreal wetlands show that biogenic sources can account for up to 30 percent of the acidifying sulfur burden in the atmosphere in remote areas of Canada. The data suggest that significant biological reemission of anthropogenic sulfur is occurring. The role of this process in the continuing acidification of the environment for years to come must be a matter of concern.

This control of flowering is one of the methods of adaptation of species by which an unfavorable season is anticipated. It implies a time-measuring system that distinguishes between light and darkness through mediation of a pigment. Ways of finding the pigment and explanations of some of the features of seasonal response are described. The pigment, now called phytochrome, is a blue or a bluish-green protein that exists in two forms interconvertible by light. Phytochrome is present to the extent of about 1 part in 10 million in many plant tissues. 18 references, 4 figures."
https://openalex.org/W2079718133,"A differentially connected array of 24 proton magnetometers has operated along the San Andreas fault since 1976. Seismomagnetic offsets of 1.2 and 0.3 nanotesla were observed at epicentral distances of 3 and 9 kilometers, respectively, after the 8 July 1986 magnitude 5.9 North Palm Springs earthquake. These seismomagnetic observation are the first obtained of this elusive but long-anticipated effect. The data are consistent with a seismomagnetic model of the earthquake for which right-lateral rupture of 20 centimeters is assumed on a 16-kilometer segment of the Banning fault between the depths of 3 and 10 kilometers in a region with average magnetization of 1 ampere per meter. Alternative explanations in terms of electrokinetic effects and earthquake-generated electrostatic charge redistribution seem unlikely because the changes are permanent and complete within a 20-minute period."

https://openalex.org/W2092456636,"A frog of the leptodactylid genus Eleutherodactylus is reported from Eocene amber found in the Dominican Republic. It is the first described amphibian fossil in amber, and the oldest complete lissamphibian fossil from Mesoamerica (Central America and Mexico). Dating of the amber matrix indicates that by the end of the Eocene a diverse fauna was present in the Antilles, much earlier than has generally been proposed. The presence of this and other amber fossils from this same age suggests that Tertiary patterns of landmass movements were significant in determining the present distribution of species."
https://openalex.org/W2010627430,"Interfering light waves produce an optical interference pattern in any medium that interacts with light. This modulation of some physical parameter of the system acts as a classical holographic grating for optical radiation. When such a grating is produced through interaction of pulsed light waves with an optical transition, a transient grating is formed whose decay is a measure of the relaxation time of the excited state. Transient gratings can be formed in real space or in frequency space depending on the time ordering of the interfering light waves. The two gratings are related by a space-time transformation and contain complementary information on the optical dynamics of a system. The status of a grating can be probed by a delayed third pulse, which diffracts off this grating in a direction determined by the wave vector difference of the interfering light beams. This generalized concept of a transient grating can be used to interpret many picosecond-pulse optical experiments on condensed-phase systems. Examples of some low-temperature experiments will be presented. In principle, many of these experiments could also be performed by using stochastic broad-band excitation. In these nonlinear photon-interference experiments the time resolution is determined by the correlation time of the light source rather than its pulse width."

The occurrence of other typable strains in the broad phage groups I, II, and III corresponded closely to the frequency distribution of staphylococci reported in 1945 by Wilson and Atkinson."

https://openalex.org/W2052271608,"The 1960s meant a historical turn of Western Europe, becoming an immigration area. Net immigration has been concentrated to some of the prosperous Western European countries and has been mainly determined by the demand of their particular national labor regimes. The size of alien employment has been very differently affected by the 1973 crisis, but a multiethnical society will remain a novel feature of most Western European countries. Political abdication from full employment and technological change makes a ghetto of un(der)employment a likely prospect of a large part of the second generation of recent immigrants into Western Europe."
https://openalex.org/W1964188247,"The lower continental crust is one of the least known variables in the crust-mantle evolutionary equation. In order to study the nature and compositional heterogeneity of the lower crust, more than 20 inclusions of lower crustal granulites in volcanic rocks from the McMurdo Sound region of Antarctica were analyzed for strontium and oxygen isotopes. These inclusions were erupted from volcanic centers covering an area of 12,000 square kilometers. Along with results from analyses of major and trace elements, the isotopic data reveal a profound discontinuity in the composition and probably the age of the lower crust that coincides with the boundary between the Transantarctic Mountains and the Ross Embayment. Although this topographic boundary between East and West Antarctica is largely a Cenozoic development, which apparently reflects a simple subvertical faulting relationship due to crustal rifting, the isotopic differences in the lower crust across the boundary suggest that the current faulting and rifting may coincide with an older crustal suture, the age of which is uncertain."

These gases are separated by means of an auxiliary column. The ratio of C and H atoms of each substance is deduced from the areas of carbon dioxide and hydrogen peaks.
https://openalex.org/W2083342946,"Since the spring of 1960 a strong positive correlation between Jupiter's decametric emission and solar decametric continuum emission observed at Boulder has been evident. The time delay of 1 to 2 days, with solar emission preceding Jupiter's emission, suggests that fast solar corpuscles, at velocities of the order of 0.1 c, are directly involved in the planet's atmosphere or magnetic field."
