https://openalex.org/W1970125334,"Reaction path methods provide a powerful tool for bridging the gap between electronic structure and chemical dynamics. Classical mechanical reaction paths may usually be understood in terms of the force field in the vicinity of a minimum energy path (MEP). When there is a significant component of hydrogenic motion along the MEP and a barrier much higher than the average energy of reactants, quantal tunneling paths must be considered, and these tend to be located on the corner-cutting side of the MEP. As the curvature of the MEP in mass-scaled coordinates is increased, the quantal reaction paths may deviate considerably from the classical ones, and the force field must be mapped out over a wider region, called the reaction swath. The required force fields may be represented by global or semiglobal analytic functions, or the dynamics may be computed ""directly"" from the electronic structure results without the intermediacy of potential energy functions. Applications to atom and diatom reactions in the gas phase and at gas-solid interfaces and to reactions of polyatomic molecules in the gas phase, in clusters, and in aqueous solution are discussed as examples."

In contrast to lateral undulation and limbed locomotion, concertina locomotion by Coluber is more energetically expensive. The findings do not support the widely held notion that the energetic cost of terrestrial locomotion by limbless animals is less than that of limbed animals."
https://openalex.org/W2030272622,"Recent media coverage has given the impression that scientists can't agree among themselves whether the buildup of greenhouse gases is going to scorch the globe or merely leave it imperceptibly warmed. But a soon-to-be-published report, the most broadly based assessment of the greenhouse threat conducted to data, presents a very different impression: There's virtual unanimity among greenhouse experts that a warming is on the way and that the consequences will be serious. The report, produced by a working group of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), will be the basis for discussions at a major international meeting in October that is intended to provide governments with options for responding to greenhouse warming. Some researchers argue that there has been no clear sign of global warming in the past century, even though carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have been accumulating in the atmosphere at an accelerating rate. Their conclusion: computer climate models are probably greatly exaggerating the warming predicted for the next century."

https://openalex.org/W2021898690,"A unique chlorotic leaf pattern on citrus trees in Florida that is attributed to fluorine is reported. The chlorosis was first noted in Polk County in April 1950 and was associated with a triple superphosphate manufacturing plant that recently opened. The polluting condition was corrected, but as new triple superphosphate plants opened, chlorosis increased. Florida pebble rock phosphate contains 2-4% fluorine which is released during the production in triple superphosphate. Chlorotic leaves from affected groves ranged in fluorine content from 370 ppM to as low as 478 ppM. Chlorotic citrus leaves were observed up to 6 miles away from the nearest plant, but the leaves were not abnormally high in fluorine content. It appears that fluorine causes leaf chlorosis and is then dissipated by translocation. Normal appearing leaves away from the affected area contained from 12 to 30 ppM fluorine. In 1955 sprays of aqueous acids were applied at concentrations 0.1 n to 4 year old ruby red grapefruit trees located 20 miles from the nearest triple superphosphate plant. Seven sprays of 1 l of solution each were applied during a 2-month period, and an identical chlorotic leaf pattern emerged in the trees sprayed with hydrofluoric and fluosilicic acid. Citrusmore » trees in California that contained up to 211 ppM fluorine did not develop chlorosis and may be the results of differences in climatic conditions, primarily the higher humidity in Florida. 6 references, 1 figure, 1 table.« less"

https://openalex.org/W2076769482,"The cartoon by Kazuko Ashizawa ([4 Oct., p. 43][1]) illustrating the contents and introduction to “Science in Japan: Competition on campus” is a close adaptation (without credit) of the theme and general form of one of the most dynamic woodblock prints of the great Japanese ukiyo-e artist Toshusai Sharaku. The print shows the actors Otani Oniji II and Ichikawa Omezo in the kabuki drama “Nihon-matsu Michinoku-sodachi” (“The Countryman from Nihonmatsu in the North”) performed in August 1794. Sharaku is the ephemeral mystery man of Japanese art history about whom little is known. His work was produced in a 10-month period around 1795, after which he disappeared suddenly ([1][2]). The cartoon is analogous to Leonardo da Vinci's “Mona Lisa” depicted smoking a cigar.
