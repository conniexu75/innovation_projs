https://openalex.org/W2007675851,"The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated in brain tumor angiogenesis, and the promoter region for the VEGF gene contains several SP-1 and AP-1 (c-Fos and c-Jun) binding motifs. Among eight human glioma cell lines, cellular mRNA levels of transcription factors SP-1 and AP-1 (c-Fos and c-Jun) were found to be closely correlated with those of VEGF. VEGF expression appears to be highly susceptible to hypoxia or exogenous cytokines and growth factors. Of various cytokines and growth factors, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin 1 most potently enhanced VEGF mRNA levels of a glioma cell line, U251. Incubation of the glioma cells with bFGF or TNF-α increased both VEGF and SP-1 mRNA at 30 min and c-Fos mRNA at 1-3 h, over 5-fold. Nuclear run-on assays showed an apparent increase of the transcription of the VEGF gene as well as the SP-1 gene by bFGF or TNF-α. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that only SP-1 binding activity was increased 1 h after exposure to bFGF or TNF-α, and also that AP-1, but not SP-1, activity was significantly activated by hypoxia. Mithramycin, an inhibitor of SP-1, at 1-10 nM inhibited activation of the VEGF gene by bFGF or TNF-α but not that by hypoxia. Western blot analysis also demonstrated an increase in cellular amounts of VEGF by TNF-α and a decrease by co-administration with mithramycin. The promoter activity of the VEGF gene, which contains five SP-1 binding sites and one AP-1 binding site but not hypoxia regulatory elements, was enhanced by bFGF or TNF-α but not by hypoxia. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay with VEGF promoter deletion constructs demonstrated that four clusterized SP-1 binding sites in the proximal promoter were essential for the basal transcription and the TNF-α-dependent activation. These data indicated that the expression of the VEGF gene enhanced by bFGF or TNF-α appeared to be mediated in part through the transcription factor SP-1, suggesting a different mechanism from that for hypoxia-induced activation of the VEGF gene.

These studies suggest that many growth factors, such as bFGF, EGF, TGF-α, PDGF, and TGF-β, in addition to VEGF may modulate human glioma-induced angiogenesis. Our recent study indicates that overexpression of a proto-oncogene, c-fos, mediates neovascularization in the rat brain (42Asakuno K. Isono M. Wakabayashi Y. Mori T. Hori S. Kohno K. Kuwano M. Brain Res. 1995; 702: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting a novel involvement of a proto-oncogene or transcription factor in the angiogenic process. One can expect that these various growth factors may change the expression of VEGF, resulting in stimulation of the glioma-dependent neovascularization. In this study, we investigated which growth factor or cytokine was responsible for the enhanced expression of the VEGF gene and also which transcription factor was involved in the enhanced expression of the VEGF gene in response to growth factors and cytokines in human glioma cells. [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]UTP, and [α-32P]dCTP were obtained from Amersham Corp. Human TGF-α and bFGF were purchased from Pepro Tech Inc. VEGF and polyclonal anti-human VEGF antibody were obtained from R&D Systems. PDGF was from Collaborative Biomedical Products; IL-1 was from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD); and TNF-α was from Mochida Parmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Mithramycin was purchased from Sigma. Human VEGF121 cDNA (43Weindel K. Marmé D. Weich H.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) was used. Human GAPDH and c-Fos cDNA were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resource Bank; mouse c-Jun cDNA was a kind gift from Nancy H. Colburn (National Cancer Institute).

The Anaerocult A mini contains components that chemically bind oxygen quickly and completely, creating an oxygen-free milieu and a CO2 atmosphere. The reaction zone of Anaerotest strips were moistened with water and placed onto the lids of Petri dishes. Anaerocult A mini was placed into an incubation bag and moistened with 8.0 ml of water. The dishes were immediately placed in the incubation bag, which was sealed with Anaeroclips and incubated at 37°C. Glioma cells were exponentially grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, followed by DMEM containing 1% FBS for 4 h. Thereafter, 10 ng/ml bFGF, 100 units/ml TNF-α, and mithramycin were added for the indicated periods. Total RNAs were extracted and hybridized as described previously (12Wakabayashi Y. Shono T.

The mRNA levels were quantified by radioactivity using a Fujix BAS2000 bioimage analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). To determine the stability of VEGF mRNA, U251 cells were incubated in DMEM containing 1% FBS for 4 h, incubated with or without 10 ng/ml bFGF or 100 units/ml TNF-α for 1 h.

Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primer sequences of the single strand oligonucleotides for PCR were: −624, 5′-AAGCCCATTCCCTCTTTAGC-3′; and +430, 5′-GGCAAAGTGAGTGACCTGCT-3′. PCR proceeded using genomic DNA (100 ng) isolated from human placenta in 5 μl containing a 1 μM primer pair using a DNA thermal cycler (Astec Co., Fukuoka, Japan). An initial 5 min of denaturation at 95°C was followed by 2 min of primer annealing at 55°C and 2 min of polymerization at 72°C. The PCR product was gel purified and subcloned into pMOSBlue. Several independent clones were sequenced by the Taq cycle sequencing method. The reporter plasmids for expression in our cell lines were obtained as follows. One unit of Klenow fragment was added to the NdeI-BamHI VEGF promoter fragment and incubated at room temperature for 20 min to ensure blunt end molecules. Then the promoter fragment was cloned into the HindIII site of pSV00CAT (Nippongene Co., Tokyo, Japan) via HindIII linkers and designated pVEGF-CAT1. VEGF promoter deletions from −624 to +430 were constructed. The promoter fragment was obtained from a subclone, and from this fragments from −129, −94, or −49 to +430 were isolated. The resulting restriction fragments were made blunt ended using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and cloned into pSV00CAT using HindIII linkers and designated pVEGF-CAT2-4. U251 cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies), and then a mixture of pVEGF-CAT1 (10 μg) and pRSV-neo (0.5 μg) was added. After 8 h, the medium containing DNA and Lipofectin was replaced with fresh medium. After overnight incubation with medium, the cells were incubated in selection medium containing 0.6 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies). Growing colonies were cloned, expanded, and tested for CAT activity. The stably transfected cells were exponentially grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, followed by DMEM containing 1% FBS for 4 h. Thereafter cells were treated with 10 ng/ml bFGF, 100 units/ml TNF-α, or hypoxia for 24 h. A transient CAT assay was performed after transfection by a calcium co-precipitation method (49Yokomizo A.

The transfected cells were incubated for 6 h with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS, followed by further incubation for 4 h in DMEM containing 1% FBS. The cells were then treated with 100 units/ml TNF-α for 12 h. The cell monolayers were washed with sterile isotonic saline and harvested in 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 150 mM NaCl. The cell pellet was resuspend and sonicated in 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and then assayed for protein content by the method of Bradford (52Brandford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217341) Google Scholar). Each CAT assay was performed using identical amounts of protein as described (53Kubo T. Kohno K. Ohga T. Kawanami K. Wada M. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3860-3864PubMed Google Scholar). The CAT activities of the transient transfection assay were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. We first determined the cellular levels of VEGF mRNA in eight human glioma cell lines, which were independently isolated from patients with gliomas (38Abe T. Okamura K. Ono M. Kohno K. Mori T. Hori S. Kuwano M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 45Abe T. Mori T. Kohno K. Seiki M. Hayakawa T. Welgus H.G. Hori S. Kuwano M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1994; 12: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Northern blots demonstrated that various levels of VEGF mRNA were expressed in the eight cell lines (Fig. 1). IN301 and IN500 cells expressed the most among the eight cell lines. There was no apparent expression of VEGF mRNA in IN157 and U343 cells. VEGF mRNA levels in U251 and T98G cells were about 50%, whereas NHG1 and NHG2 cells expressed about 25% of that in IN500 cells. The VEGF gene promoter region contains a single major transcription start and several potential binding sites for the transcription factors SP-1 and AP-1 (c-Fos and c-Jun) (26Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We thus determined whether the expression of SP-1 or AP-1 was correlated with VEGF mRNA levels in several human glioma cell lines. Eight glioma cell lines expressed various mRNA levels of SP-1, c-Fos, and c-Jun, the levels of which appeared to be relatively higher in NHG1, NHG2, IN301, IN500, U251, and T98G cells, which also had relatively higher VEGF mRNA levels (Fig. 1). The mRNA levels of VEGF, SP-1, c-Fos, and c-Jun in each cell line were measured when normalized against the GAPDH mRNA levels in each glioma cell line. Cellular mRNA levels of SP-1, c-Fos, and c-Jun appeared to be correlated with those of VEGF in the eight glioma cell lines. We also examined whether the cellular mRNA levels of other growth factors, TGF-α, bFGF, and TGF-β, were correlated with SP-1 or AP-1 mRNA levels in the eight glioma cell lines. Consistent with our previous study (38Abe T. Okamura K. Ono M. Kohno K. Mori T. Hori S. Kuwano M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), these eight glioma cell lines had various mRNA levels of bFGF, TGF-α, and TGF-β. However, we did not find any significant correlation between the mRNA levels of those growth factors and those of the two transcription factors. 2M. Ryuto and M. Kuwano, unpublished observation. Although the cellular mRNA levels of other transcription factors, AP-2 and NF-1, the binding sites of which are also located on the VEGF promoter region (26Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M.

https://openalex.org/W2069035291,"Recent work has shown that IL-10 induces activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor, the STAT proteins activated by IL-10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In all cells tested, IL-10 activated Stat1 and Stat3 and induced the formation of three distinct DNA binding complexes that contained different combinations of these two transcription factors. IL-10 also activated Stat5 in Ba/F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL-10 receptor. Using a structure-function mutagenesis approach, two tyrosine residues (Tyr427 and Tyr477) in the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor were found to be redundantly required for receptor function and for activation of Stat3 but not for Stat1 or Stat5. Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL-10-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell-free system. In contrast, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation. These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand-activated IL-10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine. This study thus supports the concept that utilization of distinct STAT proteins by different cytokine receptors is dependent on the expression of particular ligand-activatable, tyrosine-containing STAT docking sites in receptor intracellular domains.

Currently, this family consists of four Janus family tyrosine kinases (JAK-1, JAK-2, JAK-3, and TYK-2) and seven latent cytosolic transcription factors (Stat1-Stat6). Recent work has indicated that each cytokine receptor uses a distinct but often overlapping combination of JAKs and STATs to effect development of cytokine-specific cellular responses. Thus, at least some of the specificity of this signal transduction pathway appears to be determined by the recruitment of particular STAT proteins to the activated receptor. Recently, we obtained insights into the mechanism underlying STAT recruitment by cytokine receptors though experiments that focused on defining the structure and function of the IFNγ receptor in signaling the induction of cellular responses (23Farrar M.A. Campbell J.D. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11706-11710Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). That work revealed that IFNγ-IFNγ receptor interaction leads to the rapid phosphorylation of a particular tyrosine contained within the pentameric sequence YDKPH in the intracellular domain of the human and murine IFNγ receptor α chains (residues 440-444 and 420-424 in the human and murine proteins, respectively) (24Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). A peptide containing the phosphorylated YDKPH sequence bound to Stat1 and prevented ligand-induced Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation and expression of DNA binding activity. This sequence thus appears to act as the IFNγ receptor docking site for Stat1 but not for any other STAT family member. Using purified recombinant proteins, we found that Stat1 binds directly to the phosphorylated YDKPH sequence (25Greenlund A.C. Morales M.O. Viviano B.L. Yan H. Krolewski J. Schreiber R.D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 677-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The latter result thus eliminates the possibility that the interaction is mediated through an adapter protein. Taken together, these observations suggest a mechanism whereby STAT protein recruitment by distinct cytokine receptors is dependent on the specificity of the SH2 domain in the STAT protein for a particular phosphotyrosine-containing sequence motif within the intracellular domain of the cytokine receptor. This concept has been strongly supported by subsequent work showing that the specific array of STAT proteins recruited by ligated cytokine receptors can be altered either by adding sequences from other receptors that recruit different STAT proteins (26Stahl N. Farrugglella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) or by exchanging the SH2 domains of one STAT for another (27Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1995; 267: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). To explore the generality of this mechanism, we have studied signaling through the ligated IL-10 receptor. This model was selected because: (a) IL-10 receptors are known to belong to the same cytokine receptor family as the IFN receptors; (b) ligation of the IL-10 receptor results in activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (28Larner A.C. David M. Feldman G.M. Igarashi K.-I. Hackett R.H. Webb D.S.A. Sweitzer S.M. Petricoin III, E.F. Finbloom D.S. Science. 1993; 261: 1730-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 29Lehmann J.D.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5043-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); and (c) IL-10 induces pleiotropic biologic responses that are distinct from those induced by IFNγ (2Moore K.W. O'Garra A. de Waal Malefyt R. Vieira P. Mosmann T.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 165-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that IL-10 activates Stat1, Stat3, and in certain cells, Stat5, leading to the formation of three or (in certain cells) four distinct DNA binding complexes. We show that a pair of tyrosine residues residing at positions 427 and 477 within the intracellular domain of the murine IL-10 receptor are obligatorily required for Stat3 recruitment but not for Stat1 or Stat5 recruitment and for induction of an IL-10-dependent biologic response. Finally, we define the Stat3 binding sites on the IL-10 receptor and demonstrate that phosphopeptides containing these docking sites bind selectively to Stat3 but not Stat1 and inhibit ligand-dependent Stat3 activation in a cell-free system. Collectively, these results demonstrate the specific recruitment of Stat3 by the IL-10 receptor, document the functional relevance of this recruitment, and demonstrate a novel process whereby different STAT proteins are recruited by different docking sites on the same receptor. The latter results thus form the basis for a novel mechanism by which a single cytokine receptor can effect multiple STAT protein recruitment. Primary murine splenocytes and resident peritoneal macrophages were obtained from naive BALB/c mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Macrophages were allowed to adhere to six-well cell culture plates in 4 ml of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2%L-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin.

An 18-base pair oligonucleotide probe based on the IFNγ response region (GRR) within the promoter of the FcγRI gene (sense strand, 5′-ATGTATTTCCCAGAAA; antisense strand, 5′-CTTTTCTGGGAAATA) was synthesized on a Beckman Oligo 1000 DNA synthesizer (Fullerton, CA). A biotinylated derivative of this probe was prepared by adding Biotin-ON Phosphoramidite (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA.) at the 5′ end of the oligonucleotide according to the manufacturer's protocol. Oligonucleotides were annealed by heating 50 µg of the 5′ and 3′ strands at 95°C for 5 min, and double-stranded oligonucleotides were purified on a 4% low-melting agarose gel (Sigma). The sequence of the 20-base pair M67 oligonucleotide probe used in this study is: sense strand, 5′-GTCGACATTTCCCGTAAATC; and antisense strand, 5′-GTAAAGGGCATTTAGCAGCT. Oligonucleotides were labeled with [32P]dATP as described (24Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Five million primary murine splenocytes or murine macrophages were plated in six-well cell culture plates. The macrophages were allowed to adhere to the cell culture plates for 4 h prior to stimulation. When IL-3-dependent derivatives of the Ba/F3 cell line were used, 5 × 106 cells were plated in the absence of IL-3, cultured for 4 h, and then stimulated with either PBS, 400 ng of IL-10, or 4 ng of IFNγ in a total volume of 4 ml. Cells were harvested after various periods of time, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (12Weber-Nordt R.M. Meraz M.A. Schreiber R.D. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3734-3744PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were removed from the plates either by gentle scraping or washing, washed in ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mM NaF, 10 µg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. After 30 min at 4°C, nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4°C, and nuclear proteins were extracted by incubation for 30 min at 4°C with 50 µl of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 µg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). Nuclear membranes were then pelleted for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and protein concentrations of the nuclear extracts were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Quantitation of DNA binding activity in 3 µg of nuclear extracts was performed using the 32P-labeled GRR probe as described (12Weber-Nordt R.M. Meraz M.A. Schreiber R.D. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3734-3744PubMed Google Scholar, 24Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography using Kodak XR5 film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). To determine the identity of transcription factors present in the DNA binding complexes, supershift experiments were performed using STAT-specific antisera and control normal rabbit serum at a dilution of 1:100. One hundred ng of biotinylated forms of the double-stranded GRR probe was incubated for 30 min at 4°C with 100 µl of streptavidin-Sepharose. The Sepharose was washed in PBS and combined with 1 ml of nuclear extracts derived from 5 × 107 BaMR cells that had been treated for 7 min at 37°C with 100 ng/ml murine IL-10. After incubation for 2 h at 4°C, the Sepharose was pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min and washed by repeated centrifugation and resuspension in 800 µl of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM NaF, 750 µM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 µg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). The Sepharose was resuspended in 50 µl of 2 × Laemmli buffer containing 180 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and the suspension was heated to 70°C for 5 min. Samples were divided in half and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA), and membranes were blocked for 18 h at 4°C with 50 mM Tris buffered physiologic saline (TBS), pH 8.0, containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Tween 20 (Sigma). Membranes were washed in TBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and incubated with Stat1- or Stat3-specific antiserum at a 1:3000 final dilution, then washed again and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit-IgG at a dilution of 1:7500 for 20 min. Antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL detection reagent (Amersham Corp.). BaMR, Raw264.7, and PEC were washed once in PBS/10% fetal calf serum, resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer, and then incubated at 4°C for 30 min. The nuclei were pelleted at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The protein concentration of the lysate was normalized to 1.1 mg of total protein in 1 ml of lysis buffer. The lysate was precleared by sequential treatment with either 2 µl of normal hamster sera (Stat1 IP) or 2 µl of normal rabbit sera (Stat3/5 IP), followed by the addition of 40 µl of protein G-Sepharose (Stat1) or protein A-Sepharose (Stat3/5). After a 45-min incubation at 4°C, the Sepharose was pelleted, and 10 µg of ATO-2F5 (anti-Stat1), 10 µg of anti-Stat5 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody, or 2 µl of anti-Stat3 polyclonal sera were added to the lysates and incubated for 45 min at 4°C. Forty five µl of the appropriate Sepharose were added to each tube and incubated for 45 min at 4°C. The Sepharose was pelleted and washed five times; then the proteins contained in the precipitate were analyzed for the presence of Stat1, Stat3, or Stat5 by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (utilizing the corresponding mAb at a concentration of 1 µg/ml). One hundred µl of streptavidin-Sepharose was incubated for 30 min at 4°C with a final concentration of 100 µM phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated biotinylated peptides in a final volume of 500 µl. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min) and washed once with 800 µl of PBS. Fifty million unstimulated BaMR cells were lysed in 1 ml of 20 mM HEPES buffered physiologic saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM NaF, 750 µM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 µg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin for 30 min at 4°C, and protein concentration was determined by BCA. The protein concentration of the lysate was adjusted to 1 mg/ml, and 2 ml of lysate were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with each of the peptide-Sepharose conjugates with constant mixing. The Sepharose was pelleted and washed five times; then the proteins contained in the precipitates were analyzed for the presence of Stat3 by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. One hundred million BaMR cells were resuspended in 2 ml of reaction buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 200 µM ascorbic acid, 4 mM ATP, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 µg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin) and disrupted in a steel Dounce (32David M. Larner A.C. Science. 1992; 257: 813-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The extent of cell disruption was monitored by trypan blue exclusion. Homogenates were diluted to a protein concentration of 40 mg/ml in reaction buffer, and 450 µl (18 mg total protein) were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 µM phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated peptides for 45 min at 4°C. Subsequently, the homogenates were treated for 15 min at 37°C with 500 ng of IL-10. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of lysis buffer. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and lysates were precleared by incubation with 4 µl of normal rabbit serum and 80 µl of protein A-Sepharose. STAT proteins were precipitated using 1 µl of Stat3-specific antiserum and 100 µl of protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the phosphotyrosine-specific RC-20 mAb. To control for protein loading, membranes were stripped according to the ECL protocol and then reprobed with Stat3 antisera. IL-10 treatment of IL-10 receptor-expressing cultured and primary cells (BaMR, RAW264.7, PEC, and splenocytes) resulted in the generation of at least three electrophoretically distinct DNA binding complexes (denoted as bands A, B, and C) that can be detected in nuclear extracts within minutes after ligand addition (Fig. 1). These complexes were visualized using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) that used an oligonucleotide probe (GRR probe) previously shown to be recognized by several different activated STAT complexes. The EMSA complexes induced by IL-10 were more complex than those induced following IFNγ treatment of the same cells. None of the nuclear extracts derived from either unstimulated receptor-bearing cells or IL-10-treated cells that lack the IL-10 receptor (Ba/F3) showed binding to the GRR probe. The appearance of the IL-10-induced DNA containing complexes in cell nuclei was dependent on the time of stimulation and the amount of IL-10 used. IL-10-induced gel shift complexes were first observed in the nucleus after 1-3 min, were maximal after 7-15 min, and disappeared 60 min after IL-10 addition (data not shown). These kinetics were distinct from those of the IFNγ-induced complexes that appeared more rapidly (i.e. were detectable in the nucleus after only 1 min of treatment) and that were still detectable in the nucleus 2-3 h after stimulation. Thus, IL-10 induces the activation of multiple DNA binding complexes with STAT-like DNA binding specificity in both cultured and primary IL-10-responsive cells. Supershift experiments performed on all IL-10-treated cells revealed that ligand induced the activation of both Stat1 and Stat3. Using peritoneal macrophages as an example (Fig. 2A), bands B and C were supershifted by Stat1-specific antiserum (lane 3), and bands A and B were supershifted by Stat3-specific antiserum (lane 5). Moreover, a combination of Stat1 and Stat3 antisera completely supershifted all three IL-10-induced EMSA complexes (data not shown). Stat2 (lane 4), Stat4 (lane 6), and Stat5 (lane 7) antisera did not influence the mobility of the EMSA complexes. These results indicate that the IL-10-induced bands A, B, and C represent a Stat3 homodimer, Stat1/Stat3 heterodimer, and a Stat1 homodimer, respectively, in these cells. Similar results were obtained using RAW264.7 cells and splenocytes (data not shown). The validity of these observations was confirmed by the demonstration that phosphorylated forms of Stat1 and Stat3 could be precipitated with Sepharose-associated biotinylated double-stranded GRR probe from IL-10-treated cells (data not shown). Recently, Horvath et al. (33Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) demonstrated that an oligonucleotide probe (M67) derived from the serum-induc"

Mutations in the human mismatch repair genes hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, and hPMS2 are associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is essential for DNA replication, where it acts as a processivity factor. Here, we identify a point mutation, pol30-104, in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae POL30 gene encoding PCNA that increases the rate of instability of simple repetitive DNA sequences and raises the rate of spontaneous forward mutation. Epistasis analyses with mutations in mismatch repair genes MSH2, MLH1, and PMS1 suggest that the pol30-104 mutation impairs MSH2/MLH1/PMS1-dependent mismatch repair, consistent with the hypothesis that PCNA functions in mismatch repair. MSH2 functions in mismatch repair with either MSH3 or MSH6, and the MSH2-MSH3 and MSH2-MSH6 heterodimers have a role in the recognition of DNA mismatches. Consistent with the genetic data, we find specific interaction of PCNA with the MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer. DNA mismatch repair plays a key role in the maintenance of genetic fidelity.

In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, defects in DNA mismatch repair cause elevated spontaneous mutation rates and increased instability of simple repeat DNA sequences. Mutations in any of the human mismatch repair genes hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, and hPMS2 are associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. Cell lines from these cancers are defective in DNA mismatch repair and display increased levels of spontaneous mutations and frequent alterations of microsatellite repeat sequences (1Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 2Umar A. Kunkel T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Epistasis analyses in yeast have suggested that MSH2 protein functions in conjunction with MSH3 or MSH6 protein in mismatch recognition. Genetic and biochemical studies in both yeast and humans have further indicated that the MSH2-MSH3 and MSH2-MSH6 complexes differ in substrate specificities. In yeast, mutations in MSH3 cause an increase in instability of microsatellite tracts but have little effect on single-base mispairs, whereas mutations in MSH6 have a more prominent effect on the incidence of single-base mispairs than on microsatellite tract instability (3Strand M.

From these and other genetic observations, it has been inferred that MSH2-MSH3 complex is more proficient in the removal of insertion-deletion mismatches of two or more nucleotides (4Johnson R.E. Kovvali G.K. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7285-7288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), whereas MSH2-MSH6 is better at removing single nucleotide mismatches (4Johnson R.E. Kovvali G.K.

Human cell lines defective in the MSH6 component of the MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer hMutSα exhibit a selective loss in the repair of base-base and single-nucleotide insertion-deletion mismatches; the repair of two-, three-, and four-nucleotide insertion-deletion mismatches is reduced 2-4-fold in these cell lines (6Drummond J.T.

Consistent with genetic observations, hMutSα binds a G/T mismatch or a one nucleotide insertion-deletion mismatch with high efficiency (6Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). By contrast, the yeast MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer exhibits little affinity for a G/T mismatch but binds insertion-deletion mismatches with high specificity (8Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S.

PCNA forms a homotrimer that acts as a sliding clamp around the DNA duplex and increases the processivity of DNA polymerases δ and ϵ (Ref. 11Krishna T.S.R. Kong X.-P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar and references therein). Here, we identify a mutation, pol30-104, that causes a dramatic increase in the rate of microsatellite instability and spontaneous mutability. To examine if hypermutability in pol30-104 arises from a defect in mismatch repair, we compared tract instability and mutability of double mutants carrying pol30-104 in combination with mismatch repair mutations with single mutants of mismatch repair genes. From these and other studies, we suggest that hypermutability in pol30-104 derives from a defect in mismatch repair. We have purified the MSH2-MSH3 complex and the MSH2 protein to near homogeneity from yeast (8Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr.

To generate new mutations of yeast PCNA, PCR mutagenesis of the POL30 gene and plasmid shuffle techniques were used. The POL30 gene in plasmid pCH1565 was mutagenized by PCR amplification using pCH1565-specific primers and the Perkin-Elmer Taq polymerase in the presence of 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 μM MnCl2 under standard conditions (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 200 μm of dNTP). Mutagenized POL30 and an appropriate pCH1565 fragment were then introduced into yeast strain CH2134 (pol30Δ::LEU2 pCH1511 [POL30 URA3]) to allow for recombination of mutagenized POL30 into vector pCH1565. Transformants were replica plated onto 5-FOA containing medium to select for loss of wild type PCNA plasmid pCH1511[POL30 URA3] and screened for cold sensitivity (14°C) and sensitivity to the alkylating agent methylmethane sulfonate (MMS). Isogenic mutant strains were generated by transformation of the respective wild type or mismatch repair defective strains with the appropriate plasmid. The pol30-104 mutation was introduced into the yeast strain MS71 (MATα ade5-1 his7-2 trp1-289 ura3-52 CAN1s) or its leu− (leu2-3,-112) isogenic parental strain AMY125 by the gene replacement method. Plasmids pCH1577 (pol30-104:LEU2) or pBJ300 (pol30-104:hisG::URA3::hisG) were digested with SacI and introduced into yeast. Genomic deletion mutations of MSH2 (4Johnson R.E. Kovvali G.K. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7285-7288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), MLH1, and PMS1 (12Strand M. Prolla T.A. Liskay R.M. Petes T.D. Nature. 1993; 365: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) were generated by the gene replacement method. All strains used in this study are isogenic and derived from AMY125. Integration of mutations were confirmed by Southern (DNA) blot analyses. Loss of the URA3 gene by recombination of the HisG sequences was selected for by plating on medium containing 5-FOA. Wild type and isogenic mutant strains were transformed with plasmid pSH91. To monitor alterations in the pSH91 repeat tract, for each strain 19 independent 100-μl cultures, each starting from ∼10 5-FOA-sensitive cells, were grown at 30°C in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium to ∼105-106 cells before being plated onto medium containing 5-FOA. The rates of tract alterations were determined by the method of the median (13Lea D.E. Coulson C.A. J. Genet. 1949; 49: 264-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Alterations in the pSH91 repeat tract were determined by PCR analysis. Using plasmid DNA isolated from 5-FOA-resistant cells, a single-stranded ∼130-nucleotide region encompassing the repeat tract was amplified by assymetric PCR using 35S-dATP (Amersham Corp.) and the primers 5′-CCATTCTAATGTCTGCCCC-3′ and 5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′. To determine the size of the alterations, the products were compared with labeled PCR products of predetermined length on 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gels. For each strain, 19 independent cultures were grown at 30°C in 100 or 500 μl of YPD, each starting from ∼10 canavanine-sensitive cells. Cells were then plated onto arginine-deficient medium containing canavanine. Rates of spontaneous forward mutation at the CAN1s locus were determined from the number of canavanine-resistant colonies by the method of the median (13Lea D.E. Coulson C.A. J. Genet. 1949; 49: 264-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Yeast PCNA was purified to homogeneity from Escherichia coli strain B834 containing the plasmid pBL228 as described (10Ayyagari R. Impellizzeri K.J. Yoder B.L. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4420-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). PCNA (2 mg) and BSA (5 mg) were coupled to 1 ml of Affi-Gel 15 in 0.1 M potassium MOPS, pH 7.5, following the instructions of the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). The coupling efficiency was greater than 95% for both PCNA and BSA, as determined by analyzing a sample before and after the coupling reaction by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. MSH2 and MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer were purified to near homogeneity from a yeast strain carrying either the plasmid for overproducing MSH2 or the plasmids for overproducing both MSH2 and MSH3 (8Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1185-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Purified MSH2 protein (500 ng) and MSH2-MSH3 complex (1 μg) were mixed with 10 μl of the PCNA or BSA containing Affi-Gel beads in 140 μl of buffer A (20 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml BSA, 1 mM dithiothreitol) containing 0.1 M KCl at 4°C for 1 h. The unbound proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the affinity matrix was washed with 0.2 ml of buffer A containing 1 M KCl at 4°C. Proteins were then eluted from the Affi-Gel beads by incubating in 25 μl of 2% SDS at 37°C for 10 min. The supernatant (2 μl) containing unbound proteins and the SDS eluates (0.5 μl) were subjected to immunoblot analysis to determine their content of MSH2 protein and the MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer. Immunoblot analysis of the 1 M KCl washes from all the binding reactions revealed that they did not contain any MSH2 protein or MSH2-MSH3 complex. Mutations of the POL30 gene were obtained using PCR mutagenesis and plasmid shuffle. A total of eight different pol30 mutations were identified by their sensitivity to MMS and by their inability to grow at the restrictive temperature of 14°C. We screened these mutations for their effects on spontaneous mutability at the CAN1s locus and found that one of these, pol30-104, caused a dramatic increase in mutability at the permissive temperature (30°C), whereas the others had little or no effect. UV sensitivity is not affected by pol30-104. The sequence of the entire coding region of the pol30-104 allele was determined. The pol30-104 mutation is a C to T transition at nucleotide 752 of the coding sequence, which results in an alanine to valine change at residue 251 of the PCNA protein. This residue is in a stretch of four amino acids that are conserved in S. cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Drosophila, mouse, and human PCNA. Because the pol30-104 mutation differs from the other cold-sensitive and MMS-sensitive pol30 mutations by increasing spontaneous mutability dramatically, we examined the possibility that pol30-104 may confer a defect in mismatch repair. To examine the effect of the pol30-104 mutation on the stability of simple DNA repeats, we used the centromeric plasmid pSH91 that contains an in-frame 33-bp insertion of poly(GT)16G in the coding sequence of a hybrid gene containing the yeast URA3 gene (12Strand M. Prolla T.A. Liskay R.M. Petes T.D. Nature. 1993; 365: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). The pSH91 repeat tract is in-frame with the URA3 gene, resulting in Ura+ cells. Alterations of the tract that produce an out-of-frame mutation give rise to Ura− cells that become resistant to 5-FOA. Compared with wild type, the pol30-104 mutation caused an 80-fold increase in the rate of tract instability (Table I). Mutations in the yeast mismatch repair genes MSH2, MLH1, and PMS1 result in elevated rates of tract instability (12Strand M. Prolla T.A. Liskay R.M. Petes T.D. Nature. 1993; 365: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). To determine whether the increased tract instability in the pol30-104 mutant could be due to a defect in mismatch repair, we examined tract instability in the pol30-104 msh2Δ, pol30-104 mlh1Δ, and pol30-104 pms1Δ double mutant strains. If tract instability in the pol30-104 mutant had resulted from an increase in slippage events during DNA replication rather than from a defect in mismatch repair, then the rate of tract instability in these double mutant strains would have increased in a multiplicative fashion. In fact, a pms1 mutation, in combination with the pol3-01 mutation, which inactivates the 3′ to 5′ proof reading exonuclease function of DNA polymerase δ, results in mutation rates that are the product of the relative rates observed in the pms1 and pol3-01 single mutants (14Morrison A. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For example, compared with wild type, although forward mutation rates of URA3 are elevated 40- and 130-fold in the pms1 and pol3-01 single mutants, respectively, the mutation rate in the pms1 pol3-01 double mutant increases 19,000-fold (14Morrison A. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). On the other hand, if tract instability in the pol30-104 mutant had resulted from a defect in mismatch repair, then double mutant strains carrying the pol30-104 mutation in combination with the mismatch repair mutations will exhibit the same level of tract instability as the msh2, mlh1, and pms1 mutants. The results in Table I show that tract instability in the pol30-104 msh2Δ, pol30-104 mlh1Δ, and pol30-104 pms1Δ double mutant strains was about the same as in the msh2Δ, mlh1Δ, and pms1Δ strains. These data are consistent with epistasis of mutations in mismatch repair genes with pol30-104. Although the possibility of a role of PCNA in a parallel and independent pathway cannot be excluded, these results suggest an involvement of PCNA in MSH2/MLH1/PMS1-dependent mismatch repair.Table IEffect of the pol30-104 mutation on the stability of poly(GT) tractsStrainGenotypeRate of tract instability (± S.D.)Rate relative to wild typeMS71Wild type6.0 (± 0.7) × 10−61YPCNA1.14pol30-1044.6 (± 0.1) × 10−480YRP85msh2Δ1.4 (± 0.2) × 10−3230YRP23mlh1Δ1.9 (± 0.4) × 10−3320AMY101pms1Δ2.2 (± 0.5) × 10−3370YPCNA1.19pol30-104 msh2Δ2.2 (± 0.2) × 10−3370YPCNA32pol30-104 mlh1Δ1.3 (± 0.2) × 10−3220YPCNA31pol30-104 pms1Δ1.5 (± 0.3) × 10−3250 Open table in a new tab We determined the nature of tract alterations in the pol30-104 mutant by sequencing the tracts that had undergone changes in plasmid pSH91 (Table II). Additions or deletions of two base pairs represent the most common alterations in all the strains tested. In the wild type strain, most of the tract alterations are additions of 2 bp. In the msh2Δ and mlh1Δ mutants, there is about a 2-fold bias in favor of 2-bp deletions over 2-bp additions, whereas in the pol30-104 mutant, 2-bp additions and deletions occur about equally frequently (Table II). Thus, the pattern of tract alterations in pol30-104 resembles more closely the pattern in the mismatch repair mutants than that in the wild type. Because pol30-104 is a missense mutation, it is not surprising that it does not cause the same degree of tract destabilization and bias as do null mutations in mismatch repair genes. To verify that tract destabilization in the pol30-104 mutant arose from inactivation of mismatch repair, we compared the pattern of tract alterations in the pol30-104 msh2Δ and pol30-104 mlh1Δ double mutant strains with that in the msh2Δ and mlh1Δ single mutant strains. When our data for the msh2Δ mutant are combined with those of Strand et al. (3Strand M. Earley M.C. Crouse G.F. Petes T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, the pattern of tract alterations in these mutant strains is almost identical. The incidence of −2 and +2 tracts was also the same in the pol30-104 mlh1Δ and mlh1Δ mutants (Table II).Table II.Types of poly(GT) tract alterations generated in pol30-104 and other mismatch repair defective strainsStrainGenotypeNumber of tracts sequencedNumber of tracts with base pair deletions (−) or additions (+)−4−2+2+4OthersMS71Wild type33022605dOther alterations observed in the wild type strain were −16, −14, −10, +14, and +14.YPCNA1.14pol30-104581243012eOther alterations observed in the pol30-104 strain were −10 and −10.YRP85msh2Δ280217bThe frequencies of the −2- and +2-bp alterations were similar in the msh2Δ and pol30-104 msh2Δ strains (χ2 for 1 degree of freedom = 0.6; p > 0.25).00MS128msh2Δ(77)aThese data are taken from Strand et al.

Open table in a new tab We also examined the effect of the pol30-104 mutation on spontaneous forward mutations of the CAN1 locus (Table III). The pol30-104 mutation caused ∼30-fold increase in the rate of spontaneous mutability, which is similar to that observed in the mlh1Δ strain and the pol30-104 mlh1Δ strains (Table III). The results for can1r are consistent with the epistasis observed for microsatellite instability.Table IIIEffect of the pol30-104 mutation on the rate of spontaneous forward mutation to canavanine resistance (can1r)StrainGenotypeRate of forward mutation to can1r (± S.D.)Rate relative to wild typeMS71Wild type3.8 (± 1.0) × 10−71YPCNA1.14pol30-1041.2 (± 0.2) × 10−532YRP23mlh1Δ9.6 (± 3.3) × 10−625YPCNA32pol30-104 mlh1Δ1.5 (± 0.5) × 10−539 Open table in a new tab To examine whether PCNA interacts physically with mismatch repair proteins, we purified PCNA from E. coli cells expressing the protein and covalently coupled it to Affi-Gel 15 beads for use as affinity matrix. The PCNA beads and control beads containing BSA were mixed with MSH2 protein and MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer that we had purified to near homogeneity from S. cerevisiae (8Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1185-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). After washing with a large volume of 1 M KCl, the beads were incubated with 2% SDS to elute bound proteins followed by immunoblot analysis of the SDS eluates to determine the amount of MSH2 protein or of MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer that was retained on the Affi-Gel beads in each case. Interestingly, while MSH2 protein alone did not show any affinity for the PCNA beads (Fig. 1A), the majority (∼80%) of the input MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer was retained on the PCNA beads (Fig. 1B). This interaction between PCNA and the MSH2-MSH3 complex is highly specific because (i) we observed no binding of MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer to the control BSA Affi-Gel 15 beads (Fig. 1B) and (ii) the association of MSH2-MSH3 with the PCNA beads was stable to washing with 1 M KCl, as indicated by the absence of the heterodimer in the 1 M KCl wash (data not shown). We show here that the pol30-104 mutation in PCNA causes an increase in the rate of instability of (GT)n repeat sequences and in the rate of forward mutations at the CAN1s locus. The effect of pol30-104 on tract alterations, however, is not quite as severe as that of null mutations in mismatch repair genes. This is likely to be due to the fact that pol30-104 is a missense mutation and not a null mutation. Null mutations in POL30 are lethal. The strong mutator phenotype of pol30-104, which is observed at the permissive temperature, distinguishes this mutation from the other cold-sensitive and MMS-sensitive pol30 mutations that we have identified. This suggested to us that hypermutability in pol30-104 may arise from a defect in mismatch repair rather than from a defect in DNA replication. To test the validity of this hypothesis, we carried out epistasis analyses of pol30-104 with null mutations in mismatch repair genes MSH2, MLH1, and PMS1. We found that the rates of tract instability, the pattern of tract alterations, and spontaneous can1r mutability were the same in double mutants of pol30-104 with null mutations in mismatch repair genes and in single mismatch repair mutants. From these genetic observations, we infer that hypermutability in pol30-104 results from a defect in mismatch repair. Our recent biochemical studies have indicated that while the MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer binds insertion/deletion mismatches with high affinity but does not bind a G/T mismatch, MSH2 by itself does not recognize any of these mismatches (8Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1185-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We now show that PCNA interacts with the MSH2-MSH3 complex but not with MSH2 protein, and the interaction between PCNA and MSH2-MSH3 is strong, being stable to challenge with 1 M KCl, further emphasizing the significance of the MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer in mismatch repair. Besides binding the MSH2-MSH3 complex, PCNA may also interact with additional components of the mismatch repair machinery, such as the MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer, PMS1, and MLH1. Our findings have implications regarding which DNA polymerase may function in mismatch repair. The aphidicolin sensitivity of mismatch repair-associated DNA synthesis (15Holmes J.J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 16Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3744-3751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had suggested that any of the three DNA polymerases, α, δ, or ϵ, might act in this process, as they are all aphidicolin-sensitive. The evidence implicating PCNA in mismatch repair would suggest that Polδ may be the polymerase involved in mismatch repair, because PCNA is an essential subunit of this DNA polymerase. Polϵ, however, could also be involved, because PCNA also stimulates this DNA polymerase. One way by which PCNA might function in mismatch repair could be as follows. The mismatch repair proteins including MSH2-MSH3 or the MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer and PMS1 and MLH1 could be targeted to the mismatch via their affinity for the mismatch and for one another, and PCNA, along with the DNA polymerase, could be loaded onto the nick remaining at the 5′ side of the mismatch prior to the removal of RNA primers and joining of nascent DNA fragments. Via DNA looping, perhaps catalyzed by the MSH proteins in a manner analogous to the MutS catalyzed α-shaped loop structures in E. coli (17Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), the mismatch bound proteins may become associated with the PCNA-DNA polymerase complex, and these interactions could be important for the subsequent excision and repair synthesis reactions. The pol30-104 mutation might impair any of these interactions. The involvement of PCNA in mismatch repair suggests the possibility that mutations in human PCNA that inactivate only its mismatch repair function may contribute to sporadic colorectal cancers (18Liu B.

https://openalex.org/W2013671870,"CREB-binding protein (CBP) functions as a coactivator molecule for a number of transcription factors including CREB, c-Fos, c-Jun, c-Myb, and several nuclear receptors. Although binding sites for these factors within CBP have been identified, the regions of CBP responsible for transcriptional activation are unknown. In this report, we show that the N-terminal half of CBP is sufficient for activation of CREB-mediated transcription and that this region contains a strong transcriptional activation domain (TAD). Both deletion of this TAD or sequestering of factors that the TAD binds using a squelching assay were found to greatly decrease the ability of CBP to activate CREB-mediated transcription. In vivo studies by others have shown that p300/CBP associates with TBP; using an in vitro approach, we show the N-terminal TAD binds TBP. We also examined the ability of the C terminus of CBP to activate transcription using GAL-CBP chimeras. With this approach, we identified two C-terminal TADs located adjacent to the c-Fos binding site. In previous studies, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) increased the transcriptional activity of a GAL full-length CBP chimera in F9 cells, and of the C terminus in PC-12 cells. Here, we demonstrate that PKA also increased the ability of the N-terminal TADs of CBP to activate transcription in PC-12 but not F9 or COS-7 cells, suggesting that this PKA-responsiveness is cell type-specific."

Recently a related neutral amino acid transporter was isolated from an adipocyte cell line (11Liao K. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1008-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and from mouse testis (12Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol.

Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), exhibits 57% identity with human ASCT1. Notably, ASCT1 and ASCT2 share approximately 40% sequence identity with the cloned glutamate transporters (13Kanai Y. Smith C.P. Hediger M.A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), indicating the existence of a large amino acid transporter gene family. The fact that ASCT1 and ASCT2 are members of a gene family including glutamate transporters provides some insights into the structure and function of these molecules. System ASC-mediated uptake of glutamate, which occurs at low pH values, appears to reflect an alteration of the selectivity of the ASC transporter (7Vadgama J.V. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3648-3652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Maenz D.D. Chenu C. Breton S. Berteloot A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1510-1516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon was described with both the cloned ASCT1 (15Tamarappoo B.K. Mcdonald K.K. Kilberg M.S. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) transporters. Conversely, the canonical system ASC substrate L-cysteine was recently shown to be transported in a pH-independent fashion by the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3/EAAC1 (16Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 419-423Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The neuronal glutamate transporter is likely to catalyze translocation of a molecule of cysteine or glutamate as a proton-thiolate or proton-carboxylate ion pair, respectively (16Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 419-423Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 17Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The overlapping substrate specificity of EAAT3 and ASCT-1 may reflect conserved elements of structure important for determining substrate selectivity in members of the neutral and acidic amino acid transporter subfamilies. A surprising property found in all cloned glutamate transporters examined to date is a chloride conductance that is activated during transport (18Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 19Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The magnitude and direction of the chloride flux do not influence amino acid transport, and it has therefore been termed a thermodynamically uncoupled flux (18Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In this work it is shown that, like glutamate transporters, ASCT1 mediates an analogous substrate-activated chloride conductance that is thermodynamically uncoupled from amino acid flux. However, a striking difference is observed between glutamate transporters and ASCT1 in terms of transport thermodynamics and cation flux coupling. Unlike glutamate transporters, which mediate a transport cycle that is completed by countertransport of potassium and results in net amino acid flux, ASCT1-mediated transport is shown to involve a symmetrical potassium-independent electroneutral exchange of neutral amino acids and sodium, such that the current activated during transport is carried only by chloride ions. Stage V-VI oocytes were obtained by partial ovariectomy of Xenopus laevis under tricaine (1 g/liter) anesthesia. Oocytes were defolliculated by collagenase treatment (1 mg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim) in calcium-free Ringer's solution. Capped mRNA was transcribed from linearized plasmids containing the coding region of ASCT1 (9Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Fairman W.A. Wu Y.-N. Murdoch G.H. North R.A. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15329-15332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), approximately 50 ng of RNA was injected into oocytes, and expression was assayed 3-5 days later by two-microelectrode voltage clamp recording and radiotracer flux measurements. During two-microelectrode voltage clamp recording (18Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), oocytes were perfused with frog Ringer's solution containing 96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. The chloride equilibrium potential was determined by measuring the reversal potential of endogenous calcium-dependent chloride channels following activation with A23187 (18Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In experiments where [Cl−] was varied or replaced, equimolar anion substitution was employed, and recordings were made with the bath grounded via a 3 M KCl/agar bridge connected to a 3 M KCl reservoir containing a Ag/AgCl electrode. Uptake of radiolabeled amino acid was measured under voltage clamp as described (20Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 μM [3H]L-alanine (2 μCi/ml, Amersham Corp.) was superfused onto oocytes clamped at indicated membrane potentials for 90 s, followed by rapid washout and scintillation counting. Heteroexchange release of [3H]L-alanine was measured after labeling the internal neutral amino acid pool by incubating cells with carrier-free [3H]L-alanine (58 Ci/mmol; 10 μCi/ml) for 1 h followed by transfer into wells containing 500 μl of Ringer's solution for 60 s in the presence of various test amino acids or control Ringer's solution. The specific radioactivity of the internal pool was determined from the quantity of free intracellular ASCT1 substrate as described previously (16Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 419-423Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes expressing ASCT1 were homogenized in ice-cold Ringer's solution (five separate pools of 10 oocytes/200 μl). Responses of voltage-clamped cells expressing ASCT1 to application of diluted homogenates were compared with the responses elicited by standard L-alanine solutions. No responses to application of cytosol were detected in oocytes not injected with ASCT1 RNA. The intracellular pool of ASCT1 substrate was equivalent to 1.2 ± 0.1 nmol alanine/oocyte (n = 5). Experiments were repeated with oocytes isolated from at least three different frogs. Efflux and influx magnitudes are expressed as ASCT1-specific values obtained after subtraction of values in matched control uninjected oocytes, which represented <5% of specific fluxes. Application of L-alanine to voltage-clamped oocytes expressing ASCT1 resulted in activation of an inward membrane current at negative potentials that reversed and became outward at positive potentials (Fig. 1A). The reversal potential of the alanine-activated current (−21.1 ± 2.0 mV; n = 4) was not significantly different from the chloride equilibrium potential in these cells (−23.0 ± 1.3 mV; n = 4). Similar to glutamate transporter currents (18Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 19Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar), changing the concentration of chloride ion in the bath solution had a dramatic effect on the current. Varying [Cl−]o shifted the reversal potential 52-mV/10-fold change in [Cl−]o, close to the prediction of the Nernst equation for a chloride-selective conductance (Fig. 1, B and C). Furthermore, substitution of Cl− by gluconate in the Ringer's solution bathing the cell abolished the outward current at positive potentials up to +80 mV (not shown), suggesting that Cl− ions carried the major part of the current activated by L-alanine superfusion. Although the current activated by alanine was voltage-dependent and reversed near the Cl− equilibrium potential, flux of [3H]L-alanine was dependent neither on the membrane potential nor the direction of the current (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that chloride ion flux is thermodynamically uncoupled from flux of alanine, similar to the phenomenon noted with cloned human glutamate transporters (18Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 19Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The chloride conductance activated during glutamate transport exhibits a chaotropic selectivity sequence SCN− > NO3− > I− > Cl− (18Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 21Eliasof S. Jahr C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This sequence was also displayed by ASCT1 (Fig. 2A). Further supporting the notion that the movement of anions is uncoupled thermodynamically from movement of amino acid, [3H]L-alanine uptake was not affected by the magnitude of the anion flux or the identity of the external anion (Fig. 2B). Superfusion of the canonical system ASC substrates L-serine and L-cysteine (9Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Fairman W.A. Wu Y.-N. Murdoch G.H. North R.A. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15329-15332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) similarly activated this anion current. With external SCN− replacement, the outward current at 0 mV was activated with EC50 values of 38 ± 4, 53 ± 5, and 62 ± 22 μM, respectively, with L-alanine, L-serine, and L-cysteine (n = 3-4). The relative conductance of SCN− ion through the channel activated by 1 mM alanine at 0 mV was approximately 60-fold greater than Cl− ion. While this relative conductance is similar to that of the glutamate transporter EAAT1, the relative conductance of SCN− through the calcium-dependent Cl− channel endogenous to the oocyte is only 4-5. 1J. I. Wadiche, E. M. Klamo, and M. P. Kavanaugh, unpublished observations. This conductance difference and the lack of effect of typical Cl− channel blockers on the conductance suggests that the anion conductance is associated with the transporter rather than an endogenous channel (18Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The measured flux of [3H]L-alanine, which was approximately 300 fmol s−1 in the experiment shown in Fig. 1, should result in a membrane current ≥29 nA if uptake involved stoichiometric translocation of at least one net positive charge during a transport cycle. However, the major current during transport of alanine results from an uncoupled chloride conductance, and at the chloride equilibrium potential no net current flows despite a large alanine flux (Fig. 1). These results suggest that alanine flux is electroneutral. This is also consistent with the voltage independence of [3H]L-alanine flux (Fig. 1D). One possible mechanism that could account for electroneutral flux would be a stoichiometric co- and countertransport of ions resulting in a zero net charge transfer during a transport cycle. For example, sodium is cotransported and potassium is countertransported by the structurally related glutamate transporters (22Kanner B.I. Bendahan A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6327-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 23Amato A. Barbour B. Szatkowski M. Attwell D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 479: 371-380Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Barbour B. Brew H. Attwell D. Nature. 1988; 335: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Countertransport of a number of K+ ions equal to the number of Na+ ions cotransported with an alanine zwitterion would result in zero net charge transfer. However, varying [K+]o under voltage clamp had no effect on the uptake of 300 μM [3H]L-alanine. Uptake was unchanged by increasing [K+]o from 0 to 50 mM (212 ± 30 fmol s−1 versus 219 ± 24 fmol s−1, respectively; −30 mV; n = 4). Furthermore, raising [K+]o in the absence of external alanine did not result in an increase in efflux of [3H]L-alanine from preloaded cells (15.6 ± 2.3 fmol and 14.4 ± 1.7 fmol s−1 in the absence and presence of 50 mM [K+]o, respectively; n = 5). Neither did elevating external K+ result in activation of a detectable anion current when SCN− was present in the bathing solution (data not shown). These results contrast with the properties of the glutamate transporters, in which efflux is stimulated by the presence of K+ outside as a consequence of thermodynamically coupled K+ countertransport (17Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kanner B.I. Bendahan A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6327-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 24Barbour B. Brew H. Attwell D. Nature. 1988; 335: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). ASCT1-mediated currents and uptake of alanine were found to require the presence of Na+o, as reported previously (9Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Fairman W.A. Wu Y.-N. Murdoch G.H. North R.A. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15329-15332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Shafqat S. Tamarappoo B.K. Kilberg M.S. Puranam R.S. McNamara J.O. Guadano-Ferraz A. Fremeau Jr., R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15351-15355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to ASCT2, which exhibited a hyperbolic dependence on [Na+]o (12Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), alanine-induced currents mediated by ASCT1 were also well described by a Hill equation with n = 1 (Fig. 3B). Another possible mechanism that could account for electroneutral uptake of [3H]L-alanine involves electroneutral exchange of extracellular and intracellular amino acid pools. In order to investigate this possibility, unidirectional efflux of intracellular [3H]L-alanine was measured during superfusion with unlabeled alanine and compared with the magnitude of the unidirectional influx. Superfusion of unlabeled alanine onto oocytes preloaded with [3H]L-alanine induced a large release of radioactivity (Fig. 3A). Unidirectional influx, measured by superfusion of [3H]L-alanine, was not significantly different from unidirectional efflux (Fig. 3A), indicating that an amount of amino acid was released equal to the amount of alanine taken up into the cell. Heteroexchange was examined by measuring release of intracellular [3H]L-alanine induced by various extracellular amino acids (Fig. 4). Addition of 300 μM external alanine, serine, threonine, and cysteine resulted in release of large amounts of internal [3H]L-alanine. Addition of equal concentrations of asparagine, proline, valine, and leucine resulted in smaller amounts of [3H]L-alanine release relative to that induced by alanine. The results of this study show that the ASCT1 transporter functions predominantly as a mediator of neutral amino acid exchange rather than of net uptake. In addition, transport is associated with a chloride channel activity that is thermodynamically uncoupled from amino acid transport. These conclusions are supported by several lines of evidence. The flux of [3H]L-alanine was not measurably coupled to the membrane electric field (Fig. 1C) despite the apparent cotransport of Na+ and lack of K+ countertransport, which would be expected to result in electrogenic unidirectional flux. Related to this observation, unidirectional flux measured with [3H]L-alanine occurred at a rate higher than would be predicted from the measured electrical currents if a stoichiometric excess of positive charge were translocated with alanine. The current that did flow during transport was due to a thermodynamically uncoupled Cl− flux (Fig. 1B). As with chloride flux associated with glutamate transport (18Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), the direction of chloride ion flow did not affect ASCT-1-mediated alanine flux (Fig. 1). Finally, measurement of unidirectional radiotracer fluxes in the same group of cells showed that influx and efflux rates were equal, indicating an obligate exchange mechanism similar to a model of system ASC function proposed by Christensen (25Christensen H. Heinz E. NatureNa + -linked Transport of Organic Solutes. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1972: 161-169Google Scholar). ASCT1- and ASCT2-mediated fluxes are sodium-dependent (9Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Utsunomiya-Tate et al. (12Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) found a Hill coefficient of 1 in examining the [Na+] dependence of ASCT2, consistent with interaction of one Na+ ion with the transporter. The same result was obtained with ASCT1 (Fig. 3). Because the reversal potential of the alanine transport current closely followed the Nernst equilibrium reversal potential for Cl− ion (Fig. 1C), an insignificant flux of net charge due to movement of Na+ and amino acid is likely to occur. It is possible therefore that a symmetrical exchange of one Na+ ion and a zwitterionic amino acid occurs during a transport cycle. This stoichiometry differs from glutamate transport, which involves cotransport of multiple Na+ ions with glutamate (17Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 26Stallcup W.B. Bulloch K. Baetge E.E. J. Neurochem. 1979; 32: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Hebert S.C. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16561-16568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In further contrast to glutamate transporters, ASCT1-mediated flux is unaffected by K+. This result is in accord with an alternating access transport model in which K+ is countertransported in a distinct kinetic step to complete a transport cycle (22Kanner B.I. Bendahan A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6327-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); this step would be circumvented in an exchange process. Although it is associated with an uncoupled chloride current, amino acid exchange mediated by ASCT1 is electroneutral in the strict thermodynamic sense. A similar conclusion about the electroneutrality of system ASC was reached in studies of human fibroblasts (8Bussolati O. Laris P.C. Rotoli B.M. Dall-Asta V. Gazzola G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8330-8335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and red blood cells (28Valdeolmillos M. Garcia-Sancho J. Herreros B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), although in contrast to the present results, an increased rate of uptake at hyperpolarized potentials was reported (8Bussolati O. Laris P.C. Rotoli B.M. Dall-Asta V. Gazzola G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8330-8335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An obligatory exchange mode of operation for ASCT1 has several implications for its physiological roles. This transport mode effectively catalyzes diffusional amino acid mixing without expending energy from the sodium electrochemical gradient. ASCT1 does not mediate net amino acid flux, but because it can catalyze heteroexchange it may effectively induce net transport of a particular substrate when a transmembrane concentration gradient for another one of its substrates exists. Intercellular flows of amino acids could be mediated in this manner. For example, abundant expression of ASC in red blood cells (6Young J.D. Jones S.E. Ellory J.C. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1980; 209: 355-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Al-Saleh E.A. Wheeler K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 684: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) might serve as an efficient mechanism to facilitate interorgan amino acid fluxes (30Elwyn D.H. Fed. Proc. 1966; 25: 854-861PubMed Google Scholar, 31Christensen H. Physiol. Rev. 1982; 62: 1193-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The ASCT1 transporter would also in principle be well suited to play a role in vectorial transepithelial flux if it were paired with an appropriately segregated concentrative transporter with overlapping substrate specificity. The present results also have structure-function implications for both the acidic and neutral amino acid transporters. ASCT1 flux, which involves K+-independent one-for-one amino acid exchange, stands in marked contrast to flux mediated by the structurally related glutamate transporters, which countertransport K+ (17Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kanner B.I. Bendahan A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6327-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 23Amato A. Barbour B.

Nature. 1988; 335: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and mediate a much smaller amount of amino acid exchange (15Tamarappoo B.K. Mcdonald K.K. Kilberg M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1279: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently, a conserved amino acid residue (Glu-404) in the glutamate transporter Glt-1 was shown to be involved in binding K+, and conservative mutations in this residue resulted in conversion of glutamate transport from net flux to obligate exchange (32Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (in press)Google Scholar). This residue is found within a highly conserved region of the glutamate transporters involved in binding the non-transported competitive antagonist kainate (33Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17668-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and the residue corresponding to Glu-404 in Glt1 is Gln-386 in ASCT1, suggesting a possible structural basis for the marked difference in transport mechanisms between these transporter subtypes. Further studies on the role of this residue and the region surrounding it will be of interest. The mechanism by which activation of an uncoupled anion conductance occurs during transport (18Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 19Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G.

J. 1996; 70: 733-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) is at present unknown. One hypothetical mechanism involves an “open channel state” arising from the generation of an anion-selective site at some stage during permeation of the amino acid through the transporter (18Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The present results tend to confirm the association of an anion-conducting state with an amino acid-bound state rather than another state such as in the potassium countertransporting limb (22Kanner B.I. Bendahan A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6327-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) of the glutamate transport cycle. The conservation of the anion selectivity sequence in both ASCT1 and the glutamate transporters (SCN− > NO3− > I− > Cl−) (18Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 21Eliasof S. Jahr C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) also suggests that key features of the permeation pathway are likely to be conserved in these molecules despite differences in amino acid selectivity and kinetic mechanism.

Different energy balance states were imposed by supramaximal percutaneous nerve stimulation (electric pulse duration, 0.2 ms; amplitude, 250-300 V), which resulted in recruitment of all motor units in the muscle (7Blei M.B. Conley K.E. Kushmerick M.J. J. Physiol. 1993; 465: 203-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Average PCr, Pi, and ATP levels and intracellular pH (pHi) in muscle fibers during 6 min of twitch contractions were studied over a 2-Hz range of twitch frequencies (0-2.2 Hz). Total cytosolic ATP hydrolysis flux and glyco(geno)lytic ATP synthesis flux (in mmol ATP liter−1 s−1) were calculated at each twitch frequency from the measured time course of PCr and pHi during twitch contractions (8Jeneson J.A.L. Wiseman R.W. Kushmerick M.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). MOP flux at steady state, JpMOP (in mmol ATP liter−1 s−1), was calculated as the difference between these fluxes. The concentrations of PCr, Pi, ADP, and pHi at each steady state were calculated assuming concentrations of ATP and total creatine of 8.2 and 42.7 mM, respectively, and creatine kinase near equilibrium (8Jeneson J.A.L. Wiseman R.W. Kushmerick M.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). The molar free energy of cytosolic ATP hydrolysis was calculated according to ΔGp = ΔGpo′+ RT ln([ADP][Pi]/[ATP], assuming ΔGpo′ is −32.8 kJ/mol at 37°C (9Rosing J. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The kinetics of [ADP] stimulation of MOP in skeletal muscle in situ were analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting using Fig.P software (Elsevier Biosoft). A modified (sigmoidal) Hill function (10Hill A.V. J. Physiol. 1910; 40: IV-VIIIGoogle Scholar) of the form (Eq 1) was used to analyze the apparent order of the kinetic function corresponding to the value of the Hill coefficient, nH (11Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley and Sons, New York, NY1975: 346-385Google Scholar). The parameters Max and Min are the y-asymptotes of the function, and x0.5 is the x value at half-maximal y (the inflection point). For comparison, the kinetics of [ADP] stimulation of MOP reported for isolated mitochondria at constant, high [Pi] (5De Martino C. Floridi A. Marcante M.L. Malorni W. Scorza-Barcellona P. Belloci M.

J. Physiol. 1989; 256: H265-H274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ex situ transgenic mouse liver (15Koretsky A.P. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 667-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were analyzed analogously by curve-fitting analysis of the specific velocity function v′([S]*) (11Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley and Sons, New York, NY1975: 346-385Google Scholar). Data points were obtained by graphical extraction in all cases except (14Katz L.A. Swain J.A. Portman M.A. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: H265-H274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transformed to v′([S]*) format, where specific velocity v′ = v/Vmax and specific substrate concentration [S]* = [S]/[S]0.5 were obtained from the experimental maximal velocity Vmax and [S]0.5 given in each study. Data on the kinetics of [ADP] stimulation of MOP during pacing and inotropic stimulation for in vivo canine heart muscle (14Katz L.A. Swain J.A. Portman M.A. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: H265-H274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from Tables 2 and 4 in Ref. 14Katz L.A. Swain J.A. Portman M.A. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: H265-H274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and transformed to v′([S]*) format using a maximal oxygen consumption of in vivo dog heart of 0.45 ml/min/g (16Huang A.H. Feigl E.O. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and 0.074 mM for [ADP]0.5 corresponding to the [ADP] in cardiac muscle at half this rate (14Katz L.A. Swain J.A. Portman M.A. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: H265-H274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The studied range of energy balance states in forearm muscle included the maximal sustainable steady state of energy balance in all subjects as judged from the physiological responses. Typically a maximum occurred at a twitch frequency of 1.6 Hz; higher twitch frequencies resulted in acidosis (8Jeneson J.A.L. Wiseman R.W. Kushmerick M.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). The calculated rate of contraction coupled ATP hydrolysis in forearm flexor muscle cells at this state was 0.25 ± 0.01 mmol ATP liter−1 s−1 (mean ± S.E., n = 6). The matching ATP synthesis flux was mostly mitochondrial (maximally 0.22 mmol ATP liter−1 s−1, Fig. 1) supplemented by a small glyco(geno)lytic ATP synthesis flux. The measured extent of steady state changes in average PCr content and pHi in muscle fibers over this range of energy balance states corresponded to approximately 4-5-fold increases of the calculated average [ADP] and [Pi] in muscle fibers during contraction (for ADP from 0.018 to 0.084 mM (Fig. 1) and for Pi from 3.5 to 21 mM, respectively). The calculated molar cytosolic free energy of ATP hydrolysis, ΔGp, decreased from approximately −64 to −54 kJ/mol ATP over this range of energy balance states. The calculated MOP flux (JpMOP) increased approximately 28-fold (from 0.008 to 0.22 mmol ATP liter−1 s−1) (Fig. 1). This flux was kinetically limited by [ADP] rather than [Pi] in view of the cytosolic concentration ranges of both substrates and the affinity of the ADP and Pi translocators in the inner mitochondrial membrane (the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) (17Souverijn J.H.M. Huisman L.A. Rosing J. Kemp A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 305: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the phosphate carrier (18Ligeti E. Brandolin G. Dupont Y. Vignais P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4423-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), respectively). Deduction of the apparent order of the kinetic function for ADP stimulation of MOP from these experimental data requires analysis of the scaled rather than the absolute sensitivity of MOP to cytosolic [ADP] (11Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley and Sons, New York, NY1975: 346-385Google Scholar), i.e. the percentage of change in flux, scaled to the maximal flux, in response to a percentage of change in stimulus. This crucial point is illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows that both first and second order functions statistically fit the covariation ([ADP], JpMOP) equally well over the experimentally accessible range but extrapolate to widely different flux asymptotes (Fig. 1, inset). Thus, analysis of the scaled MOP sensitivity to [ADP] required knowledge of the in vivo maximal and minimal MOP fluxes in the muscle cells. These could not be robustly determined experimentally because energy balance steady states outside the sampled physiological range of the ([ADP], JpMOP) covariation did not exist. One possible approach to estimate the flux asymptotes, curve-fitting of an ad hoc kinetic function to the data (3Chance B. Leigh J.S. Clark B.J. Maris J. Kent J. Nioka S. Smith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8384-8388Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), would bias the analysis. We used an alternative approach to estimate the MOP flux asymptotes in the muscle cells that was not biased toward kinetic mechanism; we analyzed the thermodynamic flow-force relation of MOP in the muscle cells (19Rottenberg H. Biophys. J. 1973; 13: 503-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20van Dam, K., Westerhoff, H. V., (1987) Thermodynamics and Control of Biological Free Energy Transduction, pp. 228–241, 323–340, Elsevier, Amsterdam.Google Scholar). Equation 1 was fitted without any constraints to the covariation (ΔGp, JpMOP) (Fig. 2A). The fitted maximal and minimal flux were 0.26 ± 0.06 and −0.03 ± 0.02 mmol ATP liter−1 s−1, respectively (± S.E. from regression; r2 = 0.91) (Fig. 2A, inset). This maximum implied that mitochondria in the muscle were stimulated up to 85% of maximal ATP synthesis flux over the full range of sustainable energy balance states (Fig. 2A). The inflection point of the sigmoidal function, (ΔGp)0.5, was −58 ± 1.6 kJ/mol (± S.E. from regression). The apparent order, nH, of the kinetic function for cytosolic [ADP] stimulation of MOP could now be determined by curve-fitting of Equation 1 to the ([ADP], JpMOP) data using these values for the flux asymptotes Max and Min (Fig. 2B). The fitted estimate for nH was 2.11 ± 0.14 (± S.E. from regression; r2 = 0.93). Clearly, this result was not compatible with the predicted value (nH = 1) in the generally accepted formalism of Chance (1LaNoue K.F. Doumen C. Adv. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 11: 207-232Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 2Chance B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1965; 49: 163-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3Chance B. Leigh J.S. Clark B.J. Maris J. Kent J. Nioka S. Smith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8384-8388Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 4Balaban R.S. Kantor H.L. Katz L.A. Briggs R.W. Science. 1985; 232: 1121-1124Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The fitted estimate for [ADP]0.5 was 44 ± 1 μM, which was approximately equal to half the full range of steady state cytosolic ADP concentrations in the muscle cells (Fig. 1, Fig. 2B). To test the generality of this in vivo result, we also analyzed the in vitro kinetics of [ADP] stimulation of MOP reported for isolated mitochondria (5De Martino C. Floridi A. Marcante M.L. Malorni W. Scorza-Barcellona P. Belloci M. Silvestrini B. Cell Tissue Res. 1979; 196: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 6Jacobus W.E. Moreadith R.W. Vandegaer K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2397-2402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chance B. Williams G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 383-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bygrave F.L. Lehninger A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 57: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B, inset). Likewise, stimulation of MOP by [ADP] reported in these in vitro studies required in each case a Hill coefficient significantly greater than 1 to explain the kinetics. The range of nH values was 2.1-2.9 (2.6 ± 0.2, mean ± S.E., n = 4) and not significantly different from the value we obtained for mitochondria studied in situ in skeletal muscle. This result was surprising because the description of approximately first order control characteristics of extramitochondrial [ADP] (2Chance B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1965; 49: 163-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3Chance B. Leigh J.S. Clark B.J. Maris J. Kent J. Nioka S. Smith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8384-8388Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) had been formulated based on just these studies (12Chance B. Williams G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 383-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To next test if this apparent kinetic order (i.e. between 2 and 3) for transduction of cytosolic [ADP] to intramitochondrial F1-ATPase explains the covariation of cytosolic [ADP] and MOP flux also in other mammalian cell types, we analyzed the reported kinetics of [ADP] stimulation of MOP in intact cardiac muscle (14Katz L.A. Swain J.A. Portman M.A. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: H265-H274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and liver (15Koretsky A.P. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 667-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) cells pooled with skeletal muscle data (Fig. 3). The covariation of [ADP] and the rate of MOP in the pooled data from all three cell types was adequately explained by a transduction function for cytosolic [ADP] with nH = 2.2 ± 0.4 (± S.E. of regression, r2 = 0.73). The main result and novel finding of this study is that the kinetic function for [ADP] stimulation of MOP in skeletal muscle is approximately a second order function of the form JpMOP = f([ADP]nH) where nH≥ 2 and not 1 as has hereto been assumed (1LaNoue K.F. Doumen C. Adv. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 11: 207-232Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 2Chance B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1965; 49: 163-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3Chance B. Leigh J.S. Clark B.J. Maris J. Kent J. Nioka S. Smith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8384-8388Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 4Balaban R.S. Kantor H.L. Katz L.A. Briggs R.W. Science. 1985; 232: 1121-1124Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This implies that the scaled sensitivity of mitochondria to variations in cytosolic [ADP] is at least 1 order of magnitude greater than has been assumed. This result impacts the understanding of the biochemistry of mitochondria and its integration in the physiology of mammalian cells. The crucial piece of information in the analysis of the apparent kinetic order of the transduction function of cytosolic [ADP] to the mitochondrial matrix was knowledge of the maximal and minimal sustainable MOP fluxes in the muscle cells. Dense sampling of the full physiological domain of the ([ADP], JpMOP) relation in itself did not allow for discriminating between first or second order (or higher order, for that matter) of the transduction function (Fig. 1). We obtained estimates of the flux asymptotes from analysis of the thermodynamic flow-force relation of MOP (Fig. 2A). This is a well established and valid description of the relation between the flux through a reaction and the concentration of its substrates and products (19Rottenberg H. Biophys. J. 1973; 13: 503-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20van Dam, K., Westerhoff, H. V., (1987) Thermodynamics and Control of Biological Free Energy Transduction, pp. 228–241, 323–340, Elsevier, Amsterdam.Google Scholar). The flow-force relation predicts that under the condition of constant sum of substrate and product concentrations, the flux (or flow) J through a reaction varies in sigmoidal fashion with the thermodynamic driving force ΔG between maximal forward and reverse rates (19Rottenberg H. Biophys. J. 1973; 13: 503-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20van Dam, K., Westerhoff, H. V., (1987) Thermodynamics and Control of Biological Free Energy Transduction, pp. 228–241, 323–340, Elsevier, Amsterdam.Google Scholar). It was previously shown that this description applies to MOP in muscle (21Jeneson J.A.L. Westerhoff H.V. Brown T.R. van Echteld C.J.A. Berger R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1474-C1484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of utmost importance to the analysis, this approach is by definition unbiased toward the specific kinetic mechanism of a reaction (20van Dam, K., Westerhoff, H. V., (1987) Thermodynamics and Control of Biological Free Energy Transduction, pp. 228–241, 323–340, Elsevier, Amsterdam.Google Scholar). The only prior knowledge about the nature of the flow-force relation of MOP in muscle that was used in the analysis was that this relation is innately sigmoidal (19Rottenberg H. Biophys. J. 1973; 13: 503-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20van Dam, K., Westerhoff, H. V., (1987) Thermodynamics and Control of Biological Free Energy Transduction, pp. 228–241, 323–340, Elsevier, Amsterdam.Google Scholar). The curve fitting of a four parameter sigmoidal function (Equation 1) to the (ΔGp, JpMOP) covariation was performed fully unconstrained. The performance of the curve fitting of this function was enhanced by its symmetrical properties. The fitted estimate of the minimal flux (−0.03 mmol ATP liter−1 s−1) predicted that there would be net ATP hydrolysis by the mitochondrial ATPase over a nonphysiological range of [ADP] in muscle (i.e. 0 < [ADP] < 13 μM) if such conditions were to be achieved experimentally in intact cells. This is not unprecedented. Net ATP hydrolysis has been demonstrated in intact isolated mitochondria (20van Dam, K., Westerhoff, H. V., (1987) Thermodynamics and Control of Biological Free Energy Transduction, pp. 228–241, 323–340, Elsevier, Amsterdam.Google Scholar, 22LaNoue K.F. Jeffries F.M.H. Radda G.K. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7667-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Berkich D.A. Williams G.D. Masiakos P.T. Smith M.B. Boyer P.D. LaNoue K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 123-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and significant ATP hydrolysis flux even at maximal net synthetic flux (22LaNoue K.F. Jeffries F.M.H. Radda G.K. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7667-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Berkich D.A. Williams G.D. Masiakos P.T. Smith M.B. Boyer P.D. LaNoue K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 123-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is entirely consistent with this relation. The flow-force relation predicted net ATP synthesis by MOP over the entire physiological range of [ADP] and [Pi] in muscle corresponding to a ΔGp range of approximately −64 to −54 kJ/mol. Of course, this was fully expected and consistent with mitochondrial function as the primary source of ATP in the eukaryotic cell. On basis of these considerations, we conclude that the estimates of the flux asymptotes from the analysis of the flow-force relation provided a sound basis for analysis of the apparent kinetic order of cytosolic [ADP] transduction in muscle in situ. The result that the apparent kinetic order of cytosolic [ADP] transduction is at least 1 order of magnitude higher than has hereto been assumed is dramatic and impacts both the understanding of the biochemistry of mitochondria and integrative physiology of mitochondrial function in the cell. According to the formalism proposed by Koshland et al. (24Koshland Jr., D.E. Goldbeter A. Stock J.B. Science. 1982; 217: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), a Hill coefficient greater than 1 implies amplified sensitivity of mitochondria to variations in cytosolic [ADP]. Sensitivity amplification of enzymes and entire metabolic pathways may be achieved by any of a number of kinetic mechanisms but not a Michaelis-Menten mechanism (24Koshland Jr., D.E. Goldbeter A. Stock J.B. Science. 1982; 217: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Therefore a fundamentally different molecular transduction mechanism for cytosolic ADP must now be considered. There is considerable in vitro experimental evidence for allosteric instead of Michaelis-Menten kinetics of adenine nucleotide translocation (13Bygrave F.L. Lehninger A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 57: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Duyckaerts C. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Fux J.-P. Sluse F.E. Liebecq C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Brandolin G. Le Saux A. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J.M. Vignais P.V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Sluse-Goffart C.M. Evens A. Duyckaerts C Sluse F.E. Westerhoff H.V. Snoep J.L. Wijker J. Sluse F.E. Khodolenko B.N. BioThermoKinetics of the Living Cell. BioThermoKinetics Press, Amsterdam, the Netherlands1996: 218-224Google Scholar). Allosteroism of the translocator ANT could be the mechanistic basis for ultrasensitivity of mitochondria to cytosolic [ADP] (24Koshland Jr., D.E. Goldbeter A. Stock J.B. Science. 1982; 217: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). First of all, our analysis showed that ultrasensitivity of isolated mitochondria to ADP under physiologically comparable conditions of limiting [ADP] and saturating [Pi] is abolished upon bypassing the enzyme-catalyzed translocation of ADP, ATP, and Pi. We analyzed the published kinetics of [ADP] stimulation of MOP for intact versus digitonin-treated mitochondria (13Bygrave F.L. Lehninger A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 57: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and found Hill coefficients of 2.9 ± 0.61, and 1.2 ± 0.05, respectively (± S.E. from regression). MOP flux in each preparation could be 100 and 33% inhibited by ANT inhibition, respectively (13Bygrave F.L. Lehninger A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 57: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting that in the latter case cytosolic ADP now had direct access to F1-ATPase in a major fraction of the preparation. This suggests that the origin of the ultrasensitivity is at the level of the translocation step in MOP, and not the phosphorylation step. Second, Sluse-Goffart et al. (27Sluse-Goffart C.M. Evens A. Duyckaerts C Sluse F.E. Westerhoff H.V. Snoep J.L. Wijker J. Sluse F.E. Khodolenko B.N. BioThermoKinetics of the Living Cell. BioThermoKinetics Press, Amsterdam, the Netherlands1996: 218-224Google Scholar) found second order rate dependence of the ADP-ADP homoexchange on extramitochondrial [ADP] over a wide range of concentrations. Other evidence from studies of the ANT suggested positive cooperativity of adenine nucleotide exchange across the intramitochondrial membrane (25Duyckaerts C. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Fux J.-P. Sluse F.E. Liebecq C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Brandolin G. Le Saux A. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J.M. Vignais P.V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that would result in allosteroism of the ANT (25Duyckaerts C. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Fux J.-P. Sluse F.E. Liebecq C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Brandolin G. Le Saux A. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J.M. Vignais P.V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) not Michaelis-Menten behavior as was originally proposed (28Pfaff E. Heldt H.W. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 10: 484-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 29Majima E. Ikawa K. Takeda M. Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29548-29554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). There is no such evidence for the Pi carrier (18Ligeti E. Brandolin G. Dupont Y. Vignais P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4423-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The apparent kinetic order of ADP transduction, nH, may well be different (but ≥2) for different cell types (e.g. skeletal versus cardiac muscle cells (Fig. 3)). The mechanistic basis for these possible differences is that specific conditions that affect ANT function such as membrane potential and phospholipid composition (30Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Krämer R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) may well differ between mitochondria in different cell types. Therefore, although the mechanistic value of n (i.e. the number of strongly cooperative binding sites on the enzyme (11Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley and Sons, New York, NY1975: 346-385Google Scholar)) for ANT in mitochondria in different cell types may be the same, the kinetic, apparent n value, nH (i.e. the actual operation of the translocation) could differ. It is nH and not n that is measured in kinetic studies. The new understanding of mitochondrial detection of variations in cytosolic [ADP] proposed in the present study integrates mitochondrial biochemistry into the physiology of mammalian cells. Second or greater instead of first order of the kinetic function for cytosolic [ADP] transduction has broad explanatory power with respect to ATP homeostasis in intact cells (Fig. 3). Energy balance in skeletal and cardiac muscle and liver cells was sufficiently explained by one and the same kinetic function JpMOP = f([ADP]nH) with nH = 2.2 (Fig. 3). Importantly, explicit consideration of proposed [Ca2+] effects on MOP flux (31McCormack J.G. Denton R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 9: 71-76Google Scholar) was not required in any of these cell types to explain the energy balance. This implies that [Ca2+] may not be a necessary signal by which cellular ATP utilization flux is transduced to the mitochondria, contrary to what has been proposed (1LaNoue K.F. Doumen C. Adv. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 11: 207-232Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 31McCormack J.G. Denton R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 9: 71-76Google Scholar). 2Ca2+ can play a role in altering the absolute MOP flux to match ATP utilization flux via “feed forward” (32Bisell C.C. Control Engineering. Chapman and Hall, London1994: 1-16Crossref Google Scholar) modulation of the absolute value of Vmax (or “gain” of MOP (32Bisell C.C. Control Engineering. Chapman and Hall, London1994: 1-16Crossref Google Scholar)) and [ADP]0.5 (or “operating point” of MOP (32Bisell C.C. Control Engineering. Chapman and Hall, London1994: 1-16Crossref Google Scholar)). Such effects are normalized and thus implicit in the reduced transduction function v′([S]*). The magnitude of these effects is, however, not constant but subject to specific conditions such as substrate selection (1LaNoue K.F. Doumen C. Adv. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 11: 207-232Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This conclusion fits the hypothesis that mitochondria detect variations in cellular ATP utilization during work via reciprocal changes in cytosolic [ADP], a biochemical concept originally proposed by Chance (2Chance B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1965; 49: 163-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). What is a fundamentally novel insight is that the apparent kinetic order of the transduction function of this signal is at least 1 order of magnitude higher than was proposed (2Chance B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1965; 49: 163-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Based on current knowledge, it now appears that two amplification mechanisms effectuate ATP homeostasis in the cell: magnitude and sensitivity amplification (24Koshland Jr., D.E. Goldbeter A. Stock J.B. Science. 1982; 217: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The first mechanism has been early recognized (1LaNoue K.F. Doumen C. Adv. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 11: 207-232Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 31McCormack J.G. Denton R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 9: 71-76Google Scholar, 33Dudley G.A. Tullson P.C. Terjung R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9109-9114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and involves increases in absolute MOP flux (e.g. mitochondrial density) to match absolute cellular capacity for ATP utilization flux. The second and newly recognized mechanism is the here described sensitivity amplification by which the relative ATP synthesis flux is matched to ATP utilization flux. This mechanism operates independent of mitochondrial density, but the amplification factor may likewise be cell type-specific because of particular conditions that affect the apparent kinetic order of ANT operation. The new challenge in understanding the integration of mitochondrial biochemistry into mammalian cell physiology will be to test this hypothesis. We gratefully acknowledge Drs.

The post-translational epimerization in all other D-amino acid-containing small peptides characterized previously from vertebrates and molluscan systems is in position 2. The standard amino acids in polypeptides translated from genes are exclusively in the L-configuration. In recent years it has been established that D-amino acids can be post-translationally introduced into such polypeptides (1Kreil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10967-10970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several small peptides have been characterized, which contain a D-amino acid. The first of these was dermorphin, a potent heptapeptide agonist of the μ-opiate receptor from amphibian skin, discovered by Erspamer and co-workers (2Monteccuchi P.C. de Castiglione R. Piani S. Gozzini L. Erspamer V. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1981; 17: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). A number of other peptides from amphibian skin (including the deltorphins and bombinin-H) were also found to have a D-amino acid. The cDNAs encoding these peptides were characterized (3Richter K. Egger R. Kreil G. Science. 1987; 238: 200-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 4Richter K. Egger R. Negri L. Corsi R. Severini C. Kreil G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4836-4839Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The results demonstrated unequivocally the presence of mRNA encoding the peptide precursor, indicating that the D-amino acid was post-translationally formed from the corresponding L-isomer. In addition to these vertebrate systems, small peptides with D-amino acids have also been described in invertebrate systems, primarily molluscs. An FMRFamide analog from the bivalve, Mytilus edulis, which contains a D-leucine, has been characterized (5Fujisawa I. Ikeda T. Nomoto K. Yasuda-Kamatani Y. Minakata H. Kenny P.T.M. Kubota I. Muneoka Y. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 102: 91-95Google Scholar). Likewise, the land snail Achatina fulica has D-amino acid-containing small peptides, achatin-I and fulicin (6Kamatani Y. Minakata H. Kenny P.T.M. Iwashita T. Watanabe K. Funase K. Sun X.P. Yongsiri A. Kim K.H. Novales-Li P. Novales E.T. Kanapi C.G. Takeuchi H. Nomoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The cDNA encoding the precursor of fulicin was found to contain the usual L-Asn codon at the D-Asn position (8Yasuda-Kamatani Y. Nakamura M. Minakata H. Nomoto K. Sakiyama F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2248-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently, the post-translational inversion of an amino acid was demonstrated in vitro for ω-agatoxin-IVB (also termed ω-agatoxin-TK), a calcium channel inhibitor from funnel web spider (9Shikata Y.

The peptide isomerase that preferentially acts on Ser46 of the 48-amino acid peptide has been isolated and characterized. The small peptides which appear to be post-translationally modified to convert an L- to a D-amino acid from a variety of phylogenetic systems are shown in Table I. Although there is no homology between vertebrate and invertebrate peptides (and the three molluscan peptides exhibit no sequence similarity), in every case the D-amino acid is found in the second position. This suggests that for small D-amino acid-containing peptides, the proteolytic event that generates the mature peptide and the post-translational enzymatic system that converts an L- to a D-amino acid work in combination to always generate the D-amino acid at position 2.Table IPrimary structure of small peptides containing D-amino acidsPeptideSequenceSourcePhylumRef.DermorphinYAFGYPS*P. sauvageiVertebrata2Monteccuchi P.C. de Castiglione R.

This octapeptide, contryphan, has a D-tryptophan residue. This is the first report of D-tryptophan being formed through post-translational modification. Furthermore, in contrast to all of the small D-amino acid-containing peptides shown in Table I, contryphan does not have the D-amino acid in position 2. Like most peptides found in Conus venoms, contryphan is cross-linked by a disulfide bond; all other peptides in Table I are not disulfide-crosslinked. The discovery and characterization of contryphan indicates that the modification system for converting L- to D-amino acids evolved in Conus venom ducts differs significantly from the post-translational isomerization of an L- to a D-amino acid described previously for all other small peptides in both vertebrate and previously characterized molluscan systems. Specimens of C. radiatus were obtained from the Philippines. The venom ducts were dissected from the cone snails, and the venom was squeezed out of the ducts as described previously (10Cruz L.J. Corpuz G. Olivera B.M. Veliger. 1976; 18: 302-308Google Scholar). The collected venom was lyophilized and stored in the freezer. Five-hundred milligrams of lyophilized venom was sequentially extracted with 10 ml each of water, 20% acetonitrile, 40% acetonitrile, and 60% acetonitrile. The venom suspension was sonicated in the extracting solvent for three 30-s periods over ice water and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min. The combined supernatants were stored at −20°C for further purification. Crude venom extract was applied onto a Vydac C18 semi-preparative column (10 × 250 mm) and eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid at 5 ml/min. Further purifications of bioactive peaks were done on a Vydac C18 analytical column (4.6 × 250 mm) eluted with the acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid system at 1 ml/min. The effluents were monitored at 220 nm. Peaks were collected in polypropylene tubes and aliquots were assayed for biological activity. Biological activity was assayed by intracranial injection in mice (9-21 days old). Aliquots (20-30 μl) of peptide in normal saline were injected using a 0.3 ml syringe with a 29-gauge needle. Each control mouse was injected with an equal volume of normal saline solution containing dissolved residue of lyophilized column buffer. After injection, the mice were placed in cages for observation. The peptide was reduced and alkylated prior to sequencing. The pH of the peptide solution was raised to 7-8 by adding 0.5 M Tris base before dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 10 mM. The solution was flushed with nitrogen, incubated at 65°C for 20 min, and cooled to room temperature. Three microliters of 4-vinylpyridine were added per 500 ml of solution. The mixture was left in the dark for 25 min at room temperature then diluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied onto a Vydac C18 analytical HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyACNacetonitrileLSIMSliquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry. column. high performance liquid chromatography acetonitrile liquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry. The purified peptide was sequenced by automated Edman degradation (11Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar) on an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer with a 120A analyzer (DNA/Peptide Facility, University of Utah). The 3-phenyl-2-thiohydantoin derivatives were identified by HPLC. The predicted mass of the peptide was compared with the molecular masses obtained by Dr. Anthony Craig of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies using laser desorption mass spectrometry and liquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry (LSIMS). The LSIMS samples were measured at 3000 resolution from a glycerol matrix. The protected peptide resin was synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and couplings using equimolar amounts of amino acid derivatives dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and hydroxybenzotriazole. Some amino acid side chains were protected as follows: Cys (trityl), OH-Pro (t-butyl), and Glu (t-butyl). After synthesis, the terminal Fmoc group was removed by treatment with 1:4 piperidine:N-methylpyrrolidone (v/v). The peptide was cleaved from the resin by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid/H20/ethanedithiol/phenol/thioanisole (80/5/2.5/7.5/5 by volume) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The mixture was filtered under vacuum into t-butyl methyl ether at −10°C. Linear peptide was collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min and washed with t-butylmethyl ether. The pellet was dissolved in 20% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied into a Vydac C18 preparative column (25 × 250 mm). Elution was carried out at 20 ml/min using a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The major peptide-containing fraction was oxidized with 1 mM iodine in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 20% acetonitrile (12Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1732-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), then the reaction was quenched with a few drops of 0.1 M ascorbic acid. The oxidized peptide was purified by HPLC. Crude venom was obtained from specimens of C. radiatus collected from Manila Bay and Marinduque. The crude venom extract prepared as described under “Materials and Methods” was applied to a C18 semi-preparative column, using a gradient of 0.45% CH3CN/min. A complicated HPLC profile, typical of Conus venoms was obtained (see Fig. 1A). When injected intracranially in mice, material from the peaks indicated by the arrows caused mild excitatory symptoms at low doses with tail raising and severe symptoms including “barrel rolling” and seizure observed with increasing dosages (see Table II).Table IIBioactivity of contryphanDoseActivityLow: 0.5-2.5 nmol/gGrooming, licking and biting of paws, occasional tail-raising, occasional hyperactivity.Medium: 4-6 nmol/gStiffening and raising of tail to almost perpendicular to body; barrel-rolling, and subsequent passivity.High: 8-20 nmol/gParalysis of extremities, circular motion, barrel-rolling, seizure, and death. Open table in a new tab The peak designated as R was resolved into several peaks on HPLC in a C18 analytical column eluted with a very slow gradient of acetonitrile. The first major peak, which showed the same activity as the R peak of A was rechromatographed to give a homogeneous peak shown in C. Similar HPLC runs of the R1 peak of A gave the profile in D; rechromatography of this peak gave a homogeneous peptide. The purified peptides were reduced, alkylated, and sequenced as described under “Materials and Methods.” The amino acid sequence obtained for peak R is shown in Table III. Because of the high tryptophan content of this peptide, we designate it as “contryphan.” Peptide R1 had an identical sequence except that it lacks the NH2-terminal Gly residue. Thus, the amino acid sequences of the two peptides are as follows.Table IIISequence analysis of contryphanCyclePeak RAssigned residueYieldpmol1Gly83.62Cys106.03Hyp91.34Trp7.75Glu23.86Pro13.27Trp1.68Cys4.9MH+ observed: 990.3; MH+ calculated: 990.4 Open table in a new tab Liquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry of the native contryphan peptide gave a monoisotopic MH+ of 990.3 (calculated MH+ = 990.4) and a monoisotopic MH+ of 933.3 (calculated MH+ = 933.3) for des-[Gly1]contryphan. These values are consistent with the amino acid sequences assigned with the Cys residues present as disulfides and the COOH termini as amide groups. To independently verify the sequence, synthetic peptides containing standard L-amino acids were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” However, the synthetic peptides did not co-elute with native contryphan. The all-L analog of contryphan showed an unusually broad HPLC peak, and it appeared to be less stable than the native peptide; flushing the synthetic peptide solution with nitrogen seemed to retard its degradation to a purple derivative. Because of the identical mass of the native and synthetic L-amino acid-containing peptide, synthetic peptide homologs containing D-tryptophan at positions 4 and 7 of contryphan were synthesized. Both the fully reduced and the oxidized/folded forms of the synthetic D-Trp4 peptide co-eluted with the corresponding forms of the natural peptide (see Fig. 2). The D-Trp4,7 and D-Trp7 analogs did not co-elute with native contryphan (Fig. 3). The presence of D-tryptophan in position 3 of des-[Gly1]contryphan was also confirmed by chemical synthesis and co-elution of native and synthetic material.Fig. 3Reverse-phase HPLC chromatograms of contryphan and analogs. a, contryphan; b, [D-Trp7]contryphan; c, [L-Trp4,D-Trp7]contryphan; d, [L-Trp4]contryphan. Peptides were applied to a C18 analytical column (Vydac, 218TP54, 4.6 × 250 mm) and eluted using a linear gradient from 13.5 to 40.5% ACN in 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid. Peaks are labeled with the apparent percent ACN at which elution occurred, calculated from the elution time. The elution position of contryphan relative to its analogs is indicated by the dotted line. Mixing experiments (not shown) demonstrate that authentic contryphan is well resolved from the all-L, D-Trp7, or L-Trp4,D-Trp7 homologs, but the three homologs are not well resolved from each other under these elution conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On intracranial injection into mice, synthetic contryphan elicited identical symptomatology to the native material (tail raising and hyperactivity) at low doses. Surprisingly, the all-L analog, [L-Trp4]contryphan shows a similar activity, whereas [D-Trp7]contryphan elicited no detectable activity (>10 nmol/g body weight). Des-[Gly1]contryphan elicited similar symptoms to contryphan but appears to be less potent; even at the highest doses (20 nmol/g), the peptide did not cause any lethality. The data presented above document the purification, characterization, and chemical synthesis of two homologous peptides, contryphan and des-[Gly1]contryphan from the venom of Conus radiatus. The most striking feature of these peptides is the presence of D-tryptophan, the first occurrence of this unusual amino acid in a Conus peptide. Indeed, as far as we are aware, D-tryptophan has not been described previously in any mRNA-encoded polypeptidic structure. Analysis of a cDNA clone from a C. radiatus venom duct library encoding contryphan has shown that D-Trp is coded for by the standard codon for L-Trp. 2M. Watkins, E. C. Jimenéz, and D. R. Hillyard, unpublished results. Previous reports of the occurrence of D-tryptophan are in peptide-like structures, which are almost certainly not translated through the normal ribosomal route, such as in the fungal aselacins, which are cyclic pentapeptolides (13Hochlowski J.E. Hill P. Whittern D.N. Scherr M.H. Rasmussen R.R. Dorin S.A. McAlpine J.B. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1994; 47: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In recent years it has been demonstrated that D-amino acids can be introduced into small peptides through post-translational modification (1Kreil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10967-10970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of D-amino acid-containing small peptides is shown in Table I. Contryphan is distinct from D-amino acid-containing peptides previously characterized in several respects. It appears to be the only small peptide (≤10 amino acids) containing a D-amino acid residue, which is also disulfide-crosslinked. Furthermore, in other small peptides, although a variety of different D-amino acids have been found (including alanine, asparagine, methionine, phenylalanine, and leucine), the D-amino acid is always the penultimate NH2-terminal amino acid (Table I). It has been suggested that the isomerase for the Leu → Asp amino acid conversion may cue into the dibasic signal for proteolytic processing of peptide precursors (1Kreil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10967-10970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), post-translationally converting the second amino acid into the D-configuration regardless of the identity of the amino acid at the designated locus. For contryphan the number 2 position rule could not apply, since the D-amino acid is Trp4. Thus, although C. radiatus is a mollusc like Achatina or Mytilus, the modification system in C. radiatus venom ducts for the isomerization of Trp4 in contryphan must use a different positional cue. It is relevant to note that in two arthropod systems, very much larger polypeptides with D-amino acids have been described, including a lobster neurohormone (14Soyez D. Van Herp F. Rossier J. Le Caer J.-P. Tensen C.P. Lafont R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 28: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), as well as the spider toxin ω-agatoxin IVB (15Kuwada M. Teramoto T. Kumagaye K.Y.

For ω-agatoxin IVB, which comprises 48 amino acids, the conversion of Ser46 to the D-isomer has been found to enhance toxin stability as well as potency as a calcium channel blocker (15Kuwada M. Teramoto T. Kumagaye K.Y. Nakajima K. Watanabe T. Kawai T. Kawakami Y. Niidome T. Sawada K. Nishizawa Y. Katayama K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 587-593PubMed Google Scholar, 17Heck S.D. Siok C.J.

Science. 1994; 266: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this case, an isomerase shown to be homologous to serine proteases has been purified from the spider venom ducts, which carries out the Leu → Asp conversion (9Shikata Y. Watanabe T. Teramoto T.

It will be of interest to compare the contryphan modification system with the spider enzyme and the enzymes carrying out the fixed positional modification found in the small molluscan and frog skin peptides. In contryphan, pairs of proline and tryptophan residues are present, but only the more NH2-terminal amino acid residues are post-translationally modified (proline to hydroxyproline and L-tryptophan to D-tryptophan). The more COOH-terminal residue remains unmodified in each case. These results suggest that such modification enzymes distinguish between closely apposed residues. The discovery of contryphan raises the question of whether other peptides with amino acids that have been post-translationally modified to the D-configuration exist in Conus venoms. We should note that since no homolog with L-tryptophan was found in C. radiatus venom, indicating that it is either absent or present at much lower levels than the D-Trp isomer. Preliminary results suggest that contryphans are distributed more widely in Conus venoms, homologous peptides have been found in venom ducts collected from other Conus species. 3M. Grilley, R. Jacobsen, and B. Olivera, unpublished results. Thus, the ability to post-translationally modify an L- to a D-amino acid may be widespread in Conus, and additional D-amino acid-containing peptides unrelated to contryphan could well be present in Conus venoms. When injected into the mouse central nervous system, contryphan elicits characteristic symptoms such as the stiff-tail syndrome (Table II). At higher doses, more generalized excitatory effects (i.e. barrel rolling and seizures) are induced. The mechanistic basis for the symptomatology observed is presently unknown. Recently, we suggested that at learst some of the excitatory activities present in the venoms of fish-hunting cone snails may act together to cause an excitotoxic shock response in the prey (19Terlau H. Shon K. Grilley M. Stocker M. Stühmer W. Olivera B.M. Nature. 1996; 381: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), which leads to very rapid immobilization of the fish prey. Given the excitatory effects of contryphan in the mammalian central nervous system, a possible function for this peptide in the venom is to contribute to the excitotoxic shock response. We thank Rick Jacobsen and Ki-Joon Shon for their contributions to this work."

In eukaryotic cells, a family of signal-transducing guanine-nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) 1The abbreviations used are: G proteinheterotrimeric guanine nucleotide regulatory proteinESTexpressed sequence tagbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s)PI-PLCβ2phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase β2ROSrod outer segmentsRT-PCRreverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateGPCRG protein-coupled receptor. orchestrates many physiological processes by coupling activated cell surface receptors to intracellular second messenger systems. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which possess a stereotypical seven-transmembrane-spanning domain architecture, bind and mediate the signaling of a variety of molecules, including hormones, neurotransmitters, odorants, and light. To date, several hundred GPCRs have been cloned or characterized (1Watson S. Arkinstall S. The G-Protein Linked Receptor FactsBook. Academic Press, San Diego1994Google Scholar). In contrast, the number of heterotrimeric G proteins, as well as the number of G protein-regulated effectors, is much more limited. heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide regulatory protein expressed sequence tag base pair(s) kilobase(s) phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase β2 rod outer segments reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate G protein-coupled receptor. G proteins are heterotrimeric, composed of α, β, and γ subunits (Gα, Gβ, Gγ). Activation of a GPCR by ligand binding stimulates the exchange of bound GDP for GTP on the Gα subunit and results in the dissociation of the Gα subunit from a tightly complexed Gβγ dimer. The released Gα and Gβγ subunits in turn regulate the activity of effector proteins, the better characterized of which include cGMP phosphodiesterase, adenylyl cyclases, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C β enzymes, and ion channels. In addition, the dimeric Gβγ subunits are involved in GPCR desensitization by recruitment of receptor kinases to the plasma membrane, and in signal transfer from seven transmembrane GPCRs to mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (reviewed in Refs. 2Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar and 3Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). The enormous diversity of the GPCR superfamily combined with the relatively limited set of G proteins and intracellular effectors poses problems for the generation of specific cellular responses to signaling molecules. It is believed that signal-sorting G proteins participate in the generation of highly specific and appropriate intracellular signals in several ways. Signaling of a particular receptor can be routed through specific G protein heterotrimers by somatic or temporal compartmentalization of the receptor and downstream signaling molecules with particular G protein subunits. For example, specificity in visual signal transduction by the light receptor, rhodopsin, is mediated in part by tissue- and cell type-specific expression of rod and cone cell Gα and Gγ subunits (4Peng Y.W. Robishaw J.D. Levine M.A. Yau K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10882-10886Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Somatic compartmentalization of other G protein α and γ subunits has been described (5Amatruda T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 6Watson J.B. Coulter P.M. Margulies J.E. de Lecea L. Danielson P.E. Erlander M.G. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To date, Gβ5, which is readily detected only in the central nervous system, is the only G protein β subunit known to be expressed in a tissue-restricted fashion (7Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, GPCR signaling specificity may be achieved at the level of G protein-receptor coupling. There is a body of evidence to suggest that specific receptors display marked preferences for particular heterotrimeric combinations of G protein α, β, and γ subunits (8Kleuss C. Hescheler J. Ewel C. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1991; 353: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 9Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B.

While it is known that not all Gβγ dimeric combinations occur in vivo, there still remain a large number of combinatorial possibilities for G protein heterotrimer assembly. Thus, mechanisms to generate G protein subunit diversity have implications for signal transduction specificity. Mammalian cDNA clones coding for at least 20 distinct Gα subunit proteins have been described (12Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 13Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). Tandem duplication followed by evolutionary divergence of Gα genes has been proposed as a fundamental genetic mechanism to increase the number and diversity of Gα subunits (14Wilkie T.M. Gilbert D.J. Olsen A.S. Chen X.N. Amatruda T.T. Korenberg J.R. Trask B.J. de Jong P. Reed R.R. Simon M.I. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing has been shown to occur for certain Gα gene transcripts and is an additional mechanism to increase G protein subunit diversity (15Strathmann M. Wilkie T.M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6477-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16Kehlenbach R.H. Matthey J. Huttner W.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition to the known Gα subunits, cDNAs encoding 5 Gβ (7Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and at least 12 Gγ (17Ray K. Kunsch C. Bonner L.M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21765-21771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) subunits have been described. The Gβ gene products are relatively similar, displaying amino acid identities ranging from 53 to 90%. The Gγ proteins, on the other hand, are much less well conserved. In this paper, we report that the Gβ5 gene is expressed as two distinct proteins in a tissue-specific manner. While Gβ5 expression in brain is confined to a single 39,000-dalton (39-kDa) species, an additional Gβ5 protein, with an apparent molecular mass of 44 kDa, is present in the vertebrate retina. We have cloned a retinal-specific Gβ5 cDNA and show that this cDNA is identical to our previously described brain cDNA Gβ5 clone with the exception of an additional 126 base pairs (bp) of sequence, encoding an additional 43 amino acids, at the 5′ end. Sequence analysis of bacteriophage clones comprising part of the murine Gβ5 genomic locus has revealed that the additional coding material derives from an upstream exon located approximately 2,900 bp (2.9 kilobase pairs) away from the initiator methionine of the 39-kDa brain Gβ5 isoform. Fractionation of bovine retinas reveals that the long 44-kDa form of Gβ5 (hereafter referred to as Gβ5L) is localized to the rod outer segment (ROS) membranes of the photoreceptor cell layer. While the function(s) of the retinally expressed Gβ5 proteins is unclear, this unexpected versatility of the Gβ5 gene has implications for G protein subunit diversity and the generation of complex, finely tuned signal transduction circuits. Partial DNA sequence of a human retinal cDNA clone encoding a potentially longer form of Gβ5 was initially identified during a search of The Institute for Genetic Research (TIGR) Human cDNA (HCD) data base using the full-length amino acid sequence of mouse Gβ5 as the query. Using the DNA sequence of the TIGR clone as a guide, we cloned the coding region of the corresponding mouse cDNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR). Amplification of first strand cDNA prepared from mouse retina total RNA (a gift of J. Chen, Caltech) was carried out with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) using the following primers: 5′-ggaattcATGTNGATCAGACCTTTCT-3′ and 5′-gctctagaTTATGCCCAAACTC-3′ (N represents an equimolar ratio of all four bases, and lowercase letters are restriction enzyme recognition sites). The resulting amplification product was directionally cloned into the pcDNAI-amp expression vector (Invitrogen) and the entire sequence of several clones determined on both strands. A 129SV mouse genomic DNA library in the cloning vector λFIXII (Stratagene) was screened using the Gβ5 cDNA as a probe according to standard methods (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Isolated phage clones were rescreened with an oligonucleotide covering the first 18 bases of the Gβ5 coding region to identify clones containing the 5′ end of the gene. Positive clones were subcloned into pBluescript SKII (Stratagene), analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion, sequenced using dye-labeled primers on an Aplied Biosystems model 373 automated sequencer. One clone was identified that contained approximately 8 kb of 5′ untranslated DNA. This 8-kb region was cloned into pBluescript SKII and partially sequenced by primer walking. For Northern analysis, 40 μg of total RNA, prepared from mouse tissues using the guanidine thiocyanate-phenol method (TriZol reagent, Life Technologies, Inc.), was fractionated on formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to Magna NT nylon membranes (MSI) and probed with an oligonucleotide specific for the predicted 5′-untranslated region of the long form of Gβ5 (5′-CTTGGCTGAGATGAGGCTAAAGGACAGAAAAGAATGAACAGGG-3′). As a control, 40 μg of commercially obtained mouse brain total RNA (Clontech) was run on an adjacent lane. The probe was labeled with polynucleotide kinase (Ambion) and [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) to a specific activity of 4 × 108 cpm/μg. Hybridization was carried out for 4 h at 37°C in 5 × SSPE (0.75 M NaCl, 50 mM NaH2PO4·H2O, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), 5 × Denhardt's reagent (0.1% w/v each Ficoll, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and bovine serum albumin), 0.5% SDS, and the blot was washed at a final stringency of 6 × SSC (0.9 M NaCl, 90 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS at 60°C for 1 min. Mouse tissues were homogenized in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.2 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.2 TIU/ml aprotinin. Cellular debris was removed by low speed centrifugation (250 × g). Crude membrane proteins were recovered as the high speed (40,000 × g) pellet fraction of the low speed supernatant. For cholate extraction, the membranes were resuspended in one volume of the original homogenate in homogenization buffer containing 1% sodium cholate and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 60 min. Protein samples (∼10 μg) were separated on 16% Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex), electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with the Gβ5-specific polyclonal antiserum, CT215 (dilution 1:1000). Bound proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Amersham). To isolate ROS, bovine retinas were fractionated as described (19Bigay J. Chabre M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, retinas were shaken on ice for 3 min in isotonic buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5) containing 45% sucrose. The suspension was then centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min. The floating ROS were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min after a 2-fold dilution of the sucrose with isotonic buffer. The crude ROS pellet was then subjected to ultracentrifugation on a stepwise sucrose density gradient, and the purified outer segments were recovered at the interface of the 1.115 and 1.135 density gradient steps. Protein samples (10 μg) were separated on discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and immobilized proteins were visualized as above using antiserum CT215 or the Gβ1-specific antiserum, BN1 (20Gautam N. Northup J. Tamir H. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7973-7977Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Expression vectors encoding PI-PLCβ2, Gαi2, and various G protein β and γ subunits used for transient transfection have been described previously (7Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Expression vectors encoding mouse Gγ4 (22Kalyanaraman S. Kalyanaraman V. Gautam N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and rat Gγ7 subunit (6Watson J.B. Coulter P.M. Margulies J.E. de Lecea L. Danielson P.E. Erlander M.G. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were the generous gifts of N. Gautam (Washington University, St. Louis, MO), and L. de Lecea and J. G. Sutcliffe (Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA), respectively. The expression construct encoding mutant Gγ2 ([Leu71]Gγ2) was provided by A. Katz. Codon 43 in Gβ5L (methionine) was changed to encode alanine by site-directed mutagenesis with Pfu polymerase basically as described (23Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar), and the resulting mutant, [Ala43]Gβ5L, was verified by DNA sequencing. Transient transfection of COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and inositol phosphate assays were performed as described previously (21Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The level of inositol phosphates was determined 25 min after addition of 10 mM LiCl. For Western analysis, 1 × 105 transiently transfected cells were scraped into 60 μl of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM DTT, 0.2 TIU/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and membranes were pelleted at 15,000 × g for 30 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized as described above. We have reported previously that the G protein β subunit, Gβ5, is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system. When immunoblots of crude membrane preparations from whole mouse brain, are probed with antiserum CT215, which recognizes a 16-amino acid peptide corresponding to the amino terminus of Gβ5, a protein of the appropriate molecular mass (39 kDa) can be readily detected. In contrast, Gβ5 immunoreactive material is not detected on Western blots of membrane protein isolated from mouse heart, spleen, kidney liver, or skeletal muscle (7Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2A. J. Watson, A. M. Aragay, V. Z. Slepak, and M. I. Simon, unpublished observations. However, we had noticed that when crude membrane preparations from murine retinas were immunoblotted and probed with antiserum CT215, another immunoreactive protein, with an apparent molecular mass of 44 kDa was present, in addition to the 39-kDa Gβ5 protein (Fig. 1). The presence of a larger protein immunologically related to Gβ5 in retina can be explained in several ways. The larger protein could be transcribed from a gene closely related to Gβ5, it could result from post-translational modification of Gβ5, or, finally, it could be a splice variant of the Gβ5 gene. Interestingly, the 44-kDa immunoreactive species was not observed in retinal protein samples obtained from rd mutant mice (Fig. 1, lane 3). Mouse strains carrying the rd mutation display retinal degeneration and a specific loss of rod photoreceptors (reviewed in Ref. 24Wright A.F. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 85-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This result suggests that the 44-kDa protein, but not the 39-kDa Gβ5 protein, is predominantly if not exclusively localized to rod cells in the retinal photoreceptor cell layer. Concurrent with our identification of a larger protein immunologically related to Gβ5 in retina, we had performed homology searches, using the amino acid sequence of mouse Gβ5 to query the Institute for Genetic Research (TIGR) human cDNA expressed sequence tag (HCD EST) data base (25Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R. Kelley J.M. Gocayne J.D. Fields C. Fraser C.M. Venter J.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 474-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), as part of our on-going efforts to identify additional members of the G protein β subunit family. This search returned 43 significant matches, 5 of which were determined to be partial sequences of the human Gβ5 homologue. The DNA sequence of one of these (EST19480), which had been isolated from a human retinal cDNA library, was found to potentially encode a longer form of Gβ5. The DNA sequence of this partial cDNA clone overlapped bases 31-108 of Gβ5, which encode the first 36 amino acids of the protein. Significantly, EST19480 also had 193 bp of unrelated sequence at its 5′ end, 126 bases of which had the potential to code for an additional in-frame 42 amino acids at the amino terminus of Gβ5. Using the DNA sequence of EST19480 as a guide, we designed oligonucleotide primers to amplify the coding region of the corresponding mouse retinal transcript. Reverse transcription and amplification of total murine retinal RNA resulted in the appearance of the predicted 1,188-bp product, which was cloned and sequenced in its entirety. The sequence of this clone, which we have designated Gβ5Long (Gβ5L), was identical to our previously reported mouse Gβ5 cDNA sequence except for the addition of a 126-base pair extension at its 5′ end. As determined for the EST19480 cDNA, the additional 126 bp of coding material in the Gβ5L cDNA has the potential to direct the synthesis of a 42-amino acid peptide, which is in-frame with the rest of Gβ5 sequence. The complete sequence of the Gβ5L coding region is shown in Fig. 2. The Gβ5L 1,185-bp open reading frame potentially encodes a protein of 395 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 43.6 kDa, in excellent agreement with the size of the retinal protein we had observed following SDS-PAGE. Homology searches of DNA and protein sequence data bases failed to identify any significant match to the retinal-specific coding material. The retinal-specific 126-bp extension has no homology to the 5′-untranslated portion of Gβ5 cDNAs isolated from mouse brain (7Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),2 suggesting that it arises by retinal-specific usage of a 5′ exon. We therefore isolated mouse genomic bacteriophage λ clones covering most of the Gβ5 genomic locus and sequenced the first 3,923 bp upstream from the initiator ATG codon found in brain Gβ5 transcripts. The beginning of the retinal-specific exon is located approximately 2,900 bp upstream of the first exon utilized in brain and is identical in sequence to the Gβ5L RT-PCR product (save for two nucleotide alterations resulting from the upstream PCR primer sequence used for cloning) (Fig. 3). Consensus 5′ and 3′ splice donor and acceptor dinucleotide sequences are present at the beginning and end of the intron separating the first and second retinal exons (Fig. 3). In addition, the genomic sequencing revealed that the 5′-untranslated sequences present in brain Gβ5 cDNAs are physically contiguous with the start of the 39-kDa Gβ5 coding region (not shown). Sequence analysis of nearly 1 kilobase of genomic DNA sequence upstream of the Gβ5L initiator ATG failed to reveal the presence of any known transcriptional control elements. However, the 2.8-kilobase pair intron between the first and second exons of Gβ5L contains consensus sites for a variety of mammalian transcription factors and enhancer-binding proteins (not shown). We conclude that we have cloned the entire coding region of the mouse homologue of the partial human cDNA sequence obtained from the HCD EST data base, and conclude further that this transcript is produced by the addition of a single exon at the 5′ end of the Gβ5 coding sequence. We previously reported that Gβ5 mRNA is expressed in brain as two transcripts of approximately 1.75 and 2.3 kb (7Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When total RNA isolated from mouse retina and mouse brain was probed with an end-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the first 43 bases of the Gβ5L 5′-untranslated sequence, we observed hybridization only to retinal RNA (Fig. 4). The retinal Gβ5L transcript is also present as two bands, with observed mobilities of 2.1 and 2.4 kb. The oligonucleotide probe did not hybridize to total brain RNA. Furthermore, when total brain RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR with primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the Gβ5L coding region, no amplification of the 1,188-bp product was observed, even though this product was readily amplified from retinal RNA (data not shown). This result indicates that Gβ5L is not expressed in brain and, coupled with our earlier results regarding the expression pattern of Gβ5, defines Gβ5L as a retinal-specific gene product. The observation that the 44-kDa Gβ5L protein is specifically lost from the retinas of mice that have undergone retinal degeneration suggests that Gβ5L is located in the photoreceptor cell layer. To characterize the retinal expression pattern of Gβ5L further, we exploited the observation that ROS can easily be separated from the inner segments and soluble retinal proteins by means of centrifugation through sucrose density gradients (19Bigay J. Chabre M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We used the polyclonal antiserum CT215 to follow the distribution of the two Gβ5 proteins in these fractions and to compare it with the distribution of the β subunit of transducin, Gβ1, which is known to be localized to the outer segment membrane. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 5. Upon low speed (5,000 × g) centrifugation of gently homogenized bovine retina through 45% sucrose, the ROS membranes and soluble proteins remain in supernatant, while the inner segments and unbroken cells are found in the pellet. Both the short and long forms of Gβ5, as well as Gβ1, were found in this first supernatant fraction (S1). The ROS membranes can be separated from retinal soluble protein by dilution of the 45% sucrose supernatant and a second, 15,000 × g centrifugation. At this point, the outer segment membranes are found in the pellet fraction and soluble proteins remain in the supernatant. When we further purified bovine ROS in this way, the short form of Gβ5 was predominantly found in the soluble fraction (S2), while both the 44-kDa Gβ5L and much of Gβ1 were found in the pellet fraction (P2). Gβ5L continued to co-purify with the ROS membranes and the membrane-associated Gβ1 subunit after ultracentifugation on a stepwise sucrose density gradient (ROS) and could be only extracted from these membranes with detergents such as cholate, deoxycholate, and Lubrol (data not shown). When retinal membranes were washed more extensively, the 39-kDa Gβ5 protein could not be detected in either the P2 or ROS fractions, even though the distribution of Gβ1 was unchanged (data not shown). It is known that incubation of ROS membranes with GTP promotes the release of the Gβ1γ1 complex from the membrane fraction as a result of guanine nucleotide exchange on the transducin Gα subunit and dissociation of the transducin heterotrimer. We tested whether guanine nucleotides had a similar influence on the membrane association of the 44-kDa Gβ5L protein. However, as shown in Fig. 6, when we incubated ROS membranes with the nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide, GTPγS, the 44-kDa Gβ5 protein continued to remain completely associated with the membrane. As expected, incubation of the ROS membranes with GTPγS effected the release of approximately 60% of Gβ1. Our observation that the retinal 39-kDa Gβ5 protein was essentially soluble and not associated with cell membranes was unexpected. We therefore examined the membrane association of the Gβ5 protein in mouse brain, and compared its distribution to that of the Gβ1 protein (Fig. 7). In contrast to our observations in retina, in brain both of the G protein β subunits were associated with cell membranes. At least 70% of the detectable Gβ5 protein in mouse brain was found in the membrane pellet (P), and the Gβ5 present in this fraction could not be extracted in the absence of detergents (data not shown). A solution of 1% cholate, which solubilized about 50% of the total membrane proteins, was able to solubilize nearly all of Gβ5 (compare supernatant and pellet fractions of the 1% cholate material in Fig. 7). As expected, all of the Gβ1 protein in these samples was membrane-associated, and roughly 50% of this protein could be removed by cholate extraction. The Gβ proteins are members of a much larger multiprotein family termed WD repeat proteins. The β subunits of G proteins are able to form stable dimers with G protein γ subunits, and these Gβγ dimers are capable of regulating the activity of several effector enzymes, including the β2 and β3 isotypes of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C. In contrast, non-Gβ WD repeat proteins do not dimerize with Gγ subunits nor"

We investigated the minimal requirements of rLALF for endotoxin and lipid A binding with linear 10-mer peptides. Only one linear peptide, corresponding to amino acids 36-45 of rLALF, was able to bind lipid A and endotoxin above background levels. Cyclic peptides, however, bind lipid A and endotoxin with high affinity, presumably by mimicking the three dimensional characteristics of the exposed hairpin loop. The cyclic peptide including amino acids 36-47, LALF-14, has a lipid A binding activity comparable to the high affinity endotoxin-binding peptide polymyxin B.

In mice, it blocks tumor necrosis factor-α induction after endotoxin challenge.

Temperature-sensitive mutations in the shibire gene cause paralysis, and morphological examination of synaptic junctions in affected flies demonstrated an apparent failure of fission of vesicles from the presynaptic membrane during endocytosis (5Kosaka T. Ikeda K. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment of nerve terminals with nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs causes tubular invaginations of the plasmalemma, and the walls of these membranous tubules apparently contain rings of dynamin (6Takel K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). It has thus been hypothesized that dynamin plays a crucial role in the fission reaction during endocytosis and that the regulatory properties of the protein are controlled by cycles of GTP binding and hydrolysis. Unlike classical, low molecular weight GTPases and heterotrimeric G proteins, the affinity of dynamin for GTP and GDP is apparently in the μM (rather than the nM) range (7Tuma P.L. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the rate-limiting step in the steady-state hydrolysis of GTP by dynamin is not dissociation of the GDP product. 1J. P. Albanesi and J. F. Eccleston, personal communication. These considerations highlight the importance of knowledge of factors that regulate nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by this protein. To date, it is known that microtubules, a variety of proteins that contain SH3 domains, and phospholipids activate dynamin GTPase activity in vitro (8Herskovits J.S. Shpetner H.S. Burgess C.C.

We have thus examined the effects of these molecules on dynamin GTPase activity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe procedures used to obtain pure dynamin from bovine brain and Sf9 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus encoding human dynamin I (HDYM I) are shown in Fig. 1. Dynamin binds with high affinity to the appendage domain of α-adaptin (19Wang L.H. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this interaction to purify dynamin from bovine brain cytosol by affinity chromatography using immobilized glutathione S-transferase-α-adaptin (GSTαA). Although the majority of the dynamin flowed through this column, a significant amount of the protein remained tightly bound after extensive washing and could be eluted with buffer containing 500 mM KCl. Dynamin was highly purified in the later eluting fractions. We also found that recombinant human dynamin expressed in Sf9 cells can be affinity-purified by adsorption to Ni2+-NTA columns and elution with imidazole, even though the protein was not polyhistidine-tagged. This material was further purified to homogeneity by phosphocellulose cation exchange chromatography. BIAcore binding assays demonstrated that both bovine brain and recombinant human dynamin I have approximately the same affinity for GSTαA (200 nM) as that reported by Wang et al. (19Wang L.H. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The two preparations also gave comparable results in experiments where GTPase activity was measured; the data shown below were all obtained with the recombinant human protein.Dynamin assembles into stacks of ring-like structures at low ionic strength (and in the absence or presence of nucleotide) (22Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), and these structures resemble the dynamin oligomers that decorate the neck of deeply invaginated clathrin-coated pits in GTPγS-treated synaptosomes (6Takel K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In addition, as mentioned, activation of dynamin GTPase by phospholipids and microtubules is positively cooperative with respect to dynamin concentration. We have discovered that human dynamin I exhibits striking positive cooperativity even in the absence of activators (Fig. 2A). Thus, the specific activity of dynamin GTPase was essentially constant at dynamin concentrations of 10-100 nM but rose severalfold as the protein concentration was elevated beyond that point. The heterotrimeric G protein βγ subunit complex inhibited dynamin GTPase activity profoundly with an IC50 of approximately 400 nM when the dynamin concentration was 5 nM. However, inhibition of GTPase activity by βγ was inapparent when the dynamin concentration was 250 nM or when dynamin GTPase activity was activated by microtubules or the SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2 (added as a GST fusion protein) (Fig. 2B). Identical results were obtained in the presence or absence of GSTαA (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that oligomerization of dynamin prevents inhibition of GTPase activity by βγ, and it is thus possible that the Gβγ binding site in dynamin is masked by oligomerization.Fig. 2Positively cooperative activation of dynamin I GTPase and inhibition by Gβγ. Steady-state GTPase activity was measured as described (21Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 757-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

C, assays were performed as in B, except that 2.5 μM GSTαA was present. Control values for each condition are as follows (units are pmol of Pi·pmol of dynamin I−1·min−1): 5 nM dynamin I, 2.6; 250 nM dynamin I, 7.9; 5 nM dynamin I + microtubules, 12.4; 5 nM dynamin I + GST-GRB2, 7.2. These values were not changed significantly by GSTαA. The G protein β1γ2 complex was purified as described (28Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear which specific lipids activate the GTPase in vivo. PH domains from several proteins bind phospholipids and display particularly high affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 (14Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 15Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Although a PH domain derived from dynamin did not bind to vesicles containing different inositol phosphates, including PtdIns(4,5)P2 (15Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), the question of interaction of intact dynamin with PtdIns(4,5)P2 has not been addressed. We prepared vesicles using mixtures of several individual phospholipids (10% w/w) with phosphatidylcholine, which does not activate dynamin GTPase activity (11Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicles containing PtdIns(4,5)P2 stimulated dynamin GTPase activity to a much greater extent than did vesicles containing the other phospholipids tested (Table I). Vesicles prepared from total brain lipids also activated dynamin GTPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A), and this effect was blocked by neomycin, which interacts with PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Fig. 3B). The basal GTPase activity of dynamin was not altered by neomycin, suggesting specificity in its inhibitory action. Furthermore, vesicles containing 10% PtdIns(4,5)P2, 90% phosphatidylcholine were potent activators of dynamin GTPase (EC50∼10 μM PtdIns(4,5)P2), and this effect was blocked by stoichiometric amounts of neomycin (Fig. 3C). These results strongly suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P2 is a specific activator of the GTPase activity of dynamin I.Table I.The effect of phospholipids on dynamin GTPase activityPhospholipidsaPC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine.GTPasepmol Pi· pmol dynamin−1· min−1None2.7PC alone2.7PS4.1PE2.6PtdIns3.0PtdIns(4)P3.0PtdIns(4,5)P214.6a PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine.

E, GDP-Giα1 prevents inhibition of dynamin GTPase activity by Gβγ. The indicated concentrations of myristoylated Giα1 (Arg178→ Cys) were added to reactions containing 5 nM dynamin I, 200 μg/ml bovine brain lipid, and 250 nMβ1γ2. The α subunit had no effect on dynamin I GTPase activity in the absence of β1γ2. Control (lipid-activated) GTPase activity was 7.2 pmol of Pi·pmol of dynamin−1·min−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next tested the capacity of Gβγ to inhibit dynamin I GTPase stimulated by either brain lipid or PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes. The IC50 for βγ was approximately 40 nM in each case (Fig. 3D), representing a 10-fold increase in potency over the effects of Gβγ observed in the absence of activators. These concentrations of Gβγ are comparable to those necessary for other well-characterized effects of this subunit complex (23Iñiguez-Lluhi J. Kleuss J. Gilman A.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 230-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The capacity of Gβγ to inhibit PtdIns(4,5)P2-stimulated GTPase activity suggests that the mechanism of stimulation of this reaction by phospholipids differs from that utilized by microtubules or GRB2. The inhibitory effect of Gβγ was prevented by stoichiometric concentrations of a GDP-bound G protein α subunit (Fig. 3E). These experiments were performed with a GTPase-deficient mutant of Giα1 (Arg178→ Cys) to eliminate the confounding effect of the GTPase activity of the wild type protein.Models describing the role of dynamin self-assembly in budding of clathrin-coated vesicles have been presented (6Takel K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 22Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). With the knowledge that clathrin-coated vesicles have been found to contain G proteins (24Silva W.I. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 56: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 25Cherksey B. Durrie R. Braun P.E. Sapirstein V.S. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we propose the following model. In the first step, it has been assumed that GDP-bound or nucleotide-free dynamin is recruited from the cytosol to clathrin-coated pits. However, in the absence of an unknown regulator of cytosolic dynamin GTPase activity, the protein would presumably be saturated with substrate and hydrolyzing nucleotide slowly but futilely. Association of dynamin with coated vesicles, presumably mediated by adaptins, would facilitate interaction of dynamin with both Gβγ and PtdIns(4,5)P2. Inhibition of GTPase activity by Gβγ could promote accumulation of dynamin in the GTP-bound form, although this remains to be demonstrated. Alternatively, Gβγ may directly prevent oligomerization of dynamin. Sequestration of Gβγ, possibly by a G protein α subunit or some other interacting protein, would permit assembly of dynamin at the neck of the budding coated pit (step 2). With an elevated GTPase activity caused by oligomerization, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and/or other factors, the synchronous hydrolysis of GTP by the assembled dynamin would trigger fission, with resultant formation of a coated vesicle (step 3). This process may well require factors that serve as effectors for GTP-dynamin. Finally, dissociation of oligomeric dynamin could favor its return to the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of dynamin I, controlled by the state of polarization of the synapse, may also play important roles in regulating binding and release of the protein from coated vesicles (26Liu J.P. Powell K.A. Südhof T.C. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21043-21050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report suggested that dynamin is linked to the internalization of a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (27Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Although much remains to be learned about this complex regulatory cycle, we suggest that the subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins are involved directly and not as more remote initiators of regulatory signals.

Furthermore, treatment of nerve terminals with nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs causes tubular invaginations of the plasmalemma, and the walls of these membranous tubules apparently contain rings of dynamin (6Takel K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). It has thus been hypothesized that dynamin plays a crucial role in the fission reaction during endocytosis and that the regulatory properties of the protein are controlled by cycles of GTP binding and hydrolysis. Unlike classical, low molecular weight GTPases and heterotrimeric G proteins, the affinity of dynamin for GTP and GDP is apparently in the μM (rather than the nM) range (7Tuma P.L. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the rate-limiting step in the steady-state hydrolysis of GTP by dynamin is not dissociation of the GDP product. 1J. P. Albanesi and J. F. Eccleston, personal communication. These considerations highlight the importance of knowledge of factors that regulate nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by this protein. To date, it is known that microtubules, a variety of proteins that contain SH3 domains, and phospholipids activate dynamin GTPase activity in vitro (8Herskovits J.S. Shpetner H.S. Burgess C.C.

Interestingly, activation of the dynamin GTPase is apparently the result of positive cooperativity among dynamin molecules in the presence of regulators such as microtubules and phospholipids.

https://openalex.org/W2076376728,"To gain additional insights into the negative gene regulatory action by triiodothyronine (T3), we isolated a 2-kilobase pair 5′-flanking region of the mouse preprothyrotropin-releasing hormone (ppTRH) gene and characterized the DNA elements mediating inhibitory regulation by T3 in the promoter region. In GH4C1 cells, the expression of the 2-kilobase pair mouse ppTRH 5′-flanking region fused to the luciferase reporter gene occurred by transfection and was significantly suppressed by T3. In contrast, T3 suppression was not observed in T3 receptor (T3R)-deficient CV-1 cells, suggesting that T3Rs were required for the negative regulation. Cotransfected mouse T3R α1, β1, and β2 possessed indistinguishable potency for the negative regulation. Deletion analysis localized the element mediating the negative regulation to the region between −83 and +46, and the sequence downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) between +12 and +46 was found to be essential for the inhibitory regulation. In mobility shift assays, only T3R monomers bound to the element containing a T3 response element half-site at −57. No apparent T3R binding was observed to the element downstream of TSS. Neither the T3 response element half-site nor the element downstream of the TSS confer T3 suppression individually in heterologous promoters. These results indicate that the negative regulation of murine ppTRH gene by T3 might be mediated by the cooperation of T3R monomers with unknown factor(s) interacting with the element downstream of the TSS."

These results indicate that β is comprised of the N-terminal (amino acids 1-235), middle (amino acids 235-950), and C-terminal (amino acids 950-1342) domains that need not be covalently connected for the enzyme to assemble and function in vitro.The β′ subunit homolog from archaebacterial genus Sulfolobus is encoded by two separate genes (16Pühler G.

Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serpins are typically 370-390 amino acid residues long, with a reactive site loop 30-40 residues from the carboxyl terminus. This loop, exposed at the surface of the protein, is the site of interaction between serpins and the serine proteinases they inhibit. The serpin reactive site loop binds to the active site of a target proteinase in a manner similar to the binding of a substrate, forming a very stable serpin-proteinase complex. Formation of this complex involves a specific peptide bond in the reactive site loop, the scissile bond (designated P1-P1′). The amino acid sequence of the reactive site loop determines an inhibitor's selectivity. Altering the reactive site loop sequence, particularly at the P1 position, can cause dramatic changes in the proteinase selectivity of a serpin (1Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparisons of serpin sequences have demonstrated that the reactive site loop and adjacent sequence is the least conserved region of the proteins. It has been suggested that after duplications of serpin genes, rapid evolutionary change of the reactive site loop region provides new inhibitor selectivities that may have value during natural selection (2Hill R.E. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1987; 326: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 3Rheaume C. Goodwin R.L. Latimer J.J. Baumann H. Berger F.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 38: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). serine protease inhibitor kilobase(s) polymerase chain reaction base pair(s). At least nine different serpins are present in mammalian plasma. They regulate the activity of serine proteinases involved in diverse physiological functions such as blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, complement activation, and inflammatory responses (1Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serpins have also been found in the hemolymph of invertebrates, including three groups of arthropods: insects, crayfish, and horseshoe crabs (4Kanost M.R. Jiang H. New Directions in Invertebrate Immunology. SOS Publications, Fair Haven, NJ1996Google Scholar). These arthropod serpins have 12-30% amino acid sequence identity with various mammalian serpins. Like their mammalian counterparts, invertebrate serpins may regulate proteinases released from blood cells during inflammation-like processes, and they may regulate pathways of proteinase cascades that ultimately activate enzymes involved in blood coagulation and melanization (4Kanost M.R. Jiang H. New Directions in Invertebrate Immunology. SOS Publications, Fair Haven, NJ1996Google Scholar, 5Miura Y. Kawabata S. Wakamiya Y. Nakamura T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol.

Academic Press, New York1993: 317-342Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Study of serpins from two species of lepidopteran insects, Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm) and Bombyx mori (silkworm), has revealed a novel genetic mechanism for generating diversity of serpin reactive site loops. Amino acid sequences of two serpins isolated from B. mori are identical in their first 336 amino acid residues but differ in sequence from residue 337 to the carboxyl terminus (7Sasaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 292: 255-261Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We isolated a large number of serpin cDNA clones from M. sexta and found the same phenomenon (8Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 55-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 38 cDNA clones, the DNA sequences of the 5′-untranslated region, the sequence encoding a secretion signal peptide, and the first 336 amino acid residues of the mature protein were identical. Beyond this point the sequences differed from clone to clone, with 10 distinct sequence variants encoding the carboxyl-terminal 39-45 residues, which includes the reactive site loop. The 3′-untranslated sequences following the translation stop codon were again identical in all of these serpin cDNAs. The occurrence in M. sexta of serpin cDNAs with a variable region encoding the reactive site loop between two constant regions appears to be due to mutually exclusive alternate exon use (8Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 55-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The variable sequence is encoded by multiple versions of the ninth exon of M. sexta serpin gene-1. We present here the complete nucleotide sequence of M. sexta serpin gene-1, in which we have identified 12 alternate versions of exon 9. We have also isolated cDNAs corresponding to all of these exon 9 variants, indicating that they are all expressed. An analysis of the region of the gene containing the exon 9 variants suggests a pathway for the duplication and divergence of the alternate exons during evolution of the gene. A M. sexta genomic DNA library in λ phage EMBL3 (9Cole K.D. Smith A.F. Wells M.A. Insect Biochem. 1990; 20: 381-388Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was screened by hybridization with a 32P-labeled M. sexta serpin-1B (previously called alaserpin) cDNA clone (10Kanost M.R. Prasad S.V. Wells M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 965-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by methods described by Sambrook et al. (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A total of 105 recombinant plaques (three genomic equivalents) from the library was screened. Positive plaques were purified, and DNA was prepared from plate lysates (12Benson S.A. Taylor R.K. BioTechniques. 1984; 2: 126-127Google Scholar). λ phage DNA from clone λE1 was digested with SalI, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into plasmid pTZ18U. A 2.7-kb SalI-EcoR I fragment from clone λA2 was subcloned into plasmid pBluescript(KS). A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to obtain a 5-kb DNA fragment of the serpin gene-1 which was not represented in the λ clones. Oligonucleotide primers were designed, based on sequence data obtained from regions near the ends of clone λE1 (primer E: 5′-CTT ACG TGG GAT CCA TAG AC-3′) and clone λA2 (primer A: 5′-CGA TTG AGG TCT AGA AGG A-3′). The PCR was carried out using a 1:1 mixture of Taq and Pfu DNA polymerases (Stratagene). Thermal cycling conditions were: 95°C, 20 s; 53°C, 60 s; 72°C, 4.5 min for 30 cycles. The resulting DNA product was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into pGem-T vector (Promega). Genomic DNA was isolated from a single M. sexta larva (13Bradfield J.Y. Wyatt G.R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1983; 88: 190-193Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Samples of the DNA (10 μg) were digested with restriction enzymes at 37°C for 6 h. The resulting fragments were separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel, transferred to GeneScreen Plus membrane (DuPont NEN), and hybridized with 32P-labeled serpin-1B cDNA (10Kanost M.R. Prasad S.V. Wells M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 965-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all according to methods described by Sambrook et al. (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA isolated from an amplified M. sexta hemocyte cDNA library (8Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 55-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as template for a PCR to obtain serpin cDNA fragments containing sequences encoded by exon 9, using a primer sequence from exon 7 (5′-GGA TCC TAA AGC TCT TTC-3′), and a vector-specific primer (5′-GTT TTC CCA GTC ACG ACG T-3′) near the 3′ end of the cDNA inserts. The PCR products were digested with HindIII and KpnI. The resulting 0.3-kb fragments were cloned into plasmid pBluescript(KS), creating a minilibrary of serpin cDNA clones containing the region from the HindIII site in exon 8 to the 3′ end. The recombinants that contained exons 9H and 9I were identified by DNA sequence analysis of randomly selected clones. To identify clones containing exon 9C, a genomic fragment containing this exon was amplified by PCR and used to screen the serpin minilibrary by colony hybridization (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The positive clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing to contain exon 9C. cDNA and genomic DNA sequences were determined from double-stranded plasmid DNA templates by the dideoxynucleotide method (14Sanger F. Miklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using modified T7 DNA polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). cDNA inserts were sequenced using T7 or T3 primers and a set of additional primers derived from the serpin cDNA sequence (10Kanost M.R. Prasad S.V. Wells M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 965-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA fragments containing the serpin gene were sequenced using subcloned restriction enzyme fragments, subclones obtained through exonuclease III deletion (15Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar), and oligonucleotide primers derived from previously determined sequences. Sequence analysis was performed using the GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package version 7.3.1 (16Genetics Computer Group, (1991) Program Manual for the GCG Package, version 7, Madison, WI.Google Scholar) and IBI Pustell programs. We screened a M. sexta genomic DNA library with a serpin-1B cDNA probe (previously called alaserpin) (10Kanost M.R. Prasad S.V. Wells M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 965-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We isolated three overlapping λ clones (λC2, λA1, λE1) and another clone (λA2) that did not overlap with this group (Fig. 1). Restriction mapping and Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the 5′ end of the cDNA hybridized with clone λE1 and that clone λA2 hybridized with the 3′ end of the cDNA (data not shown). We used sequence from the ends of λE1 and λA2 to design primers for a PCR to obtain the missing DNA fragment linking these two clones. Primer E was from a sequence 187 nucleotides from the 3′ end of λE1; primer A was from a sequence 291 nucleotides from the 5′ end of λA2. Using these primers and M. sexta genomic DNA as template in a PCR, we obtained a 5.6-kb product (PCR-1) that overlapped the sequences of λE1 and λA2 and filled in the missing genomic DNA sequence. The entire region of the serpin gene-1 locus that was subcloned and sequenced is 21,536 bp long (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Complete nucleotide sequence of M. sexta serpin gene-1. Nucleotides in the 5′-flanking region are assigned negative numbers. Nucleotide 1 is assigned based on primer extension data (17Hanneman E.H. Kanost M.R. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 19: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Exon sequences are underlined. Untranslated regions of exons are double underlined. Amino acid sequences are listed below translated exons, using the one-letter code under the middle nucleotide of each codon.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Southern blot analysis (Fig. 3) showed that the number and size of restriction enzyme digestion fragments from M. sexta genomic DNA which hybridize with serpin-1B cDNA probe are consistent with the restriction enzyme map derived from the cloned inserts that were sequenced (Fig. 1). This suggests that there is a single copy of serpin gene-1 in the M. sexta genome. We have identified a second serpin gene, M. sexta serpin gene-2, which is only distantly related to gene-1 and does not cross-hybridize even under low stringency conditions. 2H. Gan, H. Jiang, and M. R. Kanost, unpublished results. The transcription initiation site was determined previously by primer extension analysis to be 15 residues in the 5′ direction from the end of the serpin-1B (alaserpin) cDNA clone (17Hanneman E.H. Kanost M.R. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 19: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This corresponds to a G residue located 38 residues downstream from a TATA sequence (Fig. 2). The five residues preceding the initiation site (TTAGT) coincide well with an arthropod initiator consensus sequence (TCAGT) (18Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Expression of serpin gene-1 in fat body of M. sexta appears to be negatively regulated by ecdysteroids (19Kanost M.R. Prasad S. Huang Y. Willott E. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In computer searching to identify putative ecdysteroid receptor-binding sequences in serpin gene-1 we located a sequence beginning at position −327 (AGGTCAGGAACTC) which matches in 11 out of 13 positions with a consensus ecdysone receptor binding sequence (RGG/TTC/GANTGC/AC/ACTY) (20Antoniewski C. Laval M. Lepesant J.A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Perhaps when ecdysteroid levels are elevated at periods such as the larval-larval molts and prepupal stage, binding of an ecdysteroid receptor to this sequence interferes with transcription of the serpin gene, resulting in the observed decrease in serpin-1 mRNA. Comparison of the genomic sequence with the sequence of cloned serpin-1 cDNAs indicated that serpin gene-1 is divided into 10 exons, with 12 alternate forms of exon 9 (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). From the transcription initiation site to the end of exon 10, the gene is 20,581 bp long. There is a clear difference in GC content between the exons (39% G+C) and the very A+T-rich introns (30% G+C). Exon 1 encodes the translation start site and the first six amino acid residues of the signal peptide. Exon 2 encodes the remainder of the signal peptide and the beginning of the mature protein sequence. Exons 3-8 encode the remainder of the serpin-1 sequence up to amino acid residue 336. Twelve alternate versions of exon 9 then occur within a stretch of approximately 11.6 kb. These are followed by exon 10, which encodes the 3′-untranslated sequence common to all of the serpin-1 cDNAs. We used the FASTA program (GCG) to search the GenBank DNA sequence data base with sequences of the introns from serpin gene-1 and found several high scoring matches with sequences from other M. sexta genes. A 28-nucleotide region within the first intron (between exons 1 and 2) beginning at position 853 was identical at 26 positions with a sequence in the upstream region of the M. sexta microvitellogenin gene (21Wang X.-Y. Cole K.D. Law J.H. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 80: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). The very high sequence similarity and the location of these sequences near the 5′ ends of two genes expressed in fat body of M. sexta may indicate this sequence as a potential gene regulatory element. A 173-bp region in the intron between exons 9I and 9J had significant similarity with noncoding sequences from three other M. sexta genes (Fig. 4B): a sequence from intron D of arylphorin gene A (22Willott E. Wang X.-Y. Wells M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19052-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a sequence from the intron of the gene for eclosion hormone (23Horodyski F.M. Riddiford L.M. Truman J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8123-8127Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and a sequence upstream from the gene for larval cuticle protein 14 (24Rebers J.E. Riddiford L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). This sequence may represent a repetitive element in the M. sexta genome. We also discovered a 201-bp perfect inverted repeat sequence in the intron between exons 9J and 9K from nucleotide 16912 to 17112 (Fig. 5). This sequence could potentially form a large hairpin structure in the serpin-1 pre-mRNA or a cruciform structure in the double-stranded DNA of the serpin gene-1. Such a structure could conceivably influence RNA splicing and alternate exon use in the serpin gene-1. The lack of mismatches in this long inverted repeat suggests that there may be some selective pressure to preserve its structure and function. When we searched the sequence between exon 8 and exon 10 for regions that could encode the sequence Pro-Phe-Xaa-Phe, which is conserved in all of the serpin amino acid sequences (see Fig. 7A), we detected 12 open reading frames whose length and sequence are consistent with their identification as alternate versions of exon 9. These are named alphabetically A-K, and then Z. We named the most 3′ exon 9Z when we did not yet know the total number of exon 9 variants (8Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 55-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously cloned cDNAs that contained regions corresponding with exon 9A, B, D, E, F, G, and Z (8Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 55-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also previously obtained cDNA clones for which we did not yet have genomic exon 9 sequence. These have now been located (in the gene fragment obtained by PCR) as exon 9J (previously named 9λ), and exon 9K (previously exon 9κ). For another cDNA clone with exon 9μ, differing from 9J(λ) only by a 6-bp deletion, we did not identify a comparable exon 9 in the genomic sequence. Thus, 9μ may be an allelic variant of 9J(λ). To determine whether all of the exon 9 variants detected in the gene sequence are actually expressed in spliced serpin-1 mRNAs, we used a gene-specific primer and a vector-specific primer to amplify DNA from a M. sexta hemocyte cDNA library and cloned the resulting PCR fragments into plasmid vectors. In this way we obtained a large number of cDNA clones covering the 3′ part of exon 8 and all of exons 9 and 10. When these clones were sequenced we identified correctly spliced versions of all of the exon 9 variants, including exon 9C, H, and I, which were not obtained in previous library screening. These results indicate that all 12 variants of exon 9 can be correctly spliced and are present in serpin-1 mRNA populations from hemocytes. When we compared DNA sequences of exon 9 variants in the gene with the corresponding cDNAs, five minor discrepancies were identified: ATG (Met, at 9013) to TTG (Leu) in exon 9D; ATT (Ile, at 10089) to ATC (Ile) in exon 9E; GAT (Asp, at 10964) to GAC (Asp) in exon 9F; CTC (Leu, at 15646) to TTC (Phe) in exon 9J; TTT (Phe, at 17409-17410) to ACT (Thr) in exon 9K. These differences may result from allelic variation. We analyzed the sequences at the junctions between the exons and introns of serpin gene-1 (Fig. 6). We speculate that differences in the intron sequences bordering the exon 9 variants compared with other exons in the gene might be involved in regulation of the mutually exclusive use of exon 9 variants. There are some differences in the consensus sequences at the intron borders of the exon 9 variants compared with the consensus sequence for the other exons in the gene and with a consensus sequence derived from many Drosophila genes (25Mount S.M. Burk C. Hertz G. Stormo G.D. White O. Fields C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4255-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). At position −4 at the 3′ end of the introns, T is present in 9 out of 12 of the exon 9 variants. There are no A residues at this position in the exon 9 group. However, in the other group of exons, the consensus is A or T, with no G residues present at position −4. At the first residue in the exons, the exon 9 group has a consensus for C (9/12) with no G residues. In the exon 1-8, 10 group the consensus is A or G, and C is not represented at this position. In the 5′ intron splice site at position 5, the exon 9 group has A, C, or T, with no G residues, whereas the consensus for the remainder of the gene, and in Drosophila genes, is G at this position. Also, a strong preference for T at −3 and A at +3 in the exon 9 group is in contrast to the exon 1-8, 10 group and the Drosophila consensus. The amino acid sequence encoded by the exon 9 variants includes the reactive site loop, which is the site for interaction of a serpin with the active site of a serine proteinase. Changes in the amino acid sequence of this region can alter a serpin's selectivity for proteinase inhibition. It appears that multiple copies of exon 9 have arisen in serpin gene-1 through repeated exon 9 duplications. We have investigated the pathway by which such duplications might have occurred during evolution of M. sexta serpin gene-1. We aligned the amino acid sequences encoded by the exon 9 variants (Fig. 7A) as well as the nucleotide sequences of the exon 9 variants and flanking intron sequences (Fig. 7B) and used these alignments to produce evolutionary trees of the exon 9 family. The tree shown in Fig. 8 (derived from the nucleotide sequence alignment in Fig. 7B) is typical of trees produced with a number of slightly different alignments of both the nucleotide and amino acid sequences, although there were small differences in branching order in some trees. All of the trees we produced are consistent with the notion that exons 9A and 9Z and exons 9B and 9K form two exon pairs, each with a member at opposite ends of the exon 9 region, and that these exons diverged earlier than the rest of the exon 9 sequences. The remaining exon 9 sequences are apparently from a single lineage and differ from 9A, 9B, 9K, and 9Z in having conserved cysteine and proline residues near their carboxyl termini (Fig. 7A). The most recent exon duplication events occurred in the center of the exon 9 region, giving rise to exons 9C to 9J, of which exons 9E to 9H are the latest to appear. The terminal branches of this tree group exon 9E with 9G and 9F with 9H. This suggests that the most recent rearrangement of the exon 9 region was the duplication of a pair of exons, 9E and 9F to produce 9G and 9H (or vice versa). This hypothesis is supported by sequence similarity detected in intron sequences. A region of similarity was found in a 363-bp region near the 3′ ends of introns He and Hg, adjacent to exons 9E and 9G. The Bestfit score for these aligned sequences is 9 standard deviations greater than the mean score for 50 alignments from the randomized sequences of the aligned regions. An even more significant similarity exists in alignment of 392-bp sequences near the 5′ ends of introns Hg and Hi, adjacent to exons 9F and 9H (the Bestfit score is 36 standard deviations greater than the mean for 50 alignments of the randomized intron sequences). We have isolated DNA clones including the locus for M. sexta serpin gene-1 and have determined the nucleotide sequence of a 21.5-kb region that includes the serpin gene-1. The gene is composed of 10 exons, with 12 alternate versions of exon 9. Analysis of intron positions in many genes from the serpin superfamily has shown that there are a large number of sites at which introns are present, and it is likely that new introns have been acquired numerous times during divergence of the superfamily (26Wright H.T. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 36: 136-143Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). M. sexta serpin gene-1 has introns at a few positions identical with some vertebrate serpin genes. The intron between exons 5 and 6 is at the same position as introns in genes for human α1-antichymotrypsin, α1-proteinase inhibitor, protein C inhibitor, antithrombin III, C1 inhibitor, leuserpin, α2-antiplasmin, angiotensinogen, and mouse serpin J6. This position must therefore be an ancient location for an intron in serpin genes. The introns between exons 6 and 7 and between exons 7 and 8 are at the same positions as introns in the human α2-antiplasmin and C1 inhibitor genes. This suggests that an intron at this position may have been present in a common ancestor of M. sexta serpin gene-1 and these two human genes, prior to the evolutionary divergence of the invertebrates and vertebrates, and that this intron may have been lost from other vertebrate serpin genes. The intron between exons 8 and 9 in M. sexta serpin gene-1 is most intriguing because its presence allows for the alternate exon splicing to produce multiple serpin mRNAs that encode proteins with a constant protein framework and variable reactive site sequences. Among other serpin genes that have been sequenced, an intron at this position has been identified only in the genes for human and rat plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (27Bosma P.J. van den Berg E.A. Kooistra T. Siemieniak D.R. Slightom J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9129-9141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bruzdzinski C.J. Riordan-Johnson M. Nordby E.C. Suter S.M. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2078-2085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although no alternate exons have been observed in these genes, the potential exists for alternate exon use in other serpin genes that contain an intron at this position. Serpin gene duplication and sequence divergence have resulted in the presence of families of serpin genes in mammals such as humans, mice, and cattle (29Billingsley G.D. Walter M.A. Hammond G.L. Cox D.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 52: 343-353PubMed Google Scholar, 30Borriello F. Krauter K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9417-9421Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Hwang S.-R. Kohn A.B. Hook V.Y.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Sequence divergence in these genes is greatest in the region that encodes the reactive site, resulting in rapid evolution of serpins with new inhibitor selectivities (4Kanost M.R. Jiang H. New Directions in Invertebrate Immunology. SOS Publications, Fair Haven, NJ1996Google Scholar, 30Borriello F. Krauter K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9417-9421Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Evolution of the capacity to produce serpins with a variety of reactive site sequences has followed a different route in M. sexta serpin gene-1. Instead of duplication of the entire gene, only the exon encoding the reactive site loop has been duplicated. Evolutionary sequence divergence of these exons has led to the ability to synthesize serpins with 12 different reactive site sequences from a single gene through use of mutually exclusive alternate exon splicing. Similar alternate exon use probably occurs in another lepidopteran insect, the silkworm B. mori (7Sasaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 292: 255-261Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to determine how widespread this type of serpin gene structure may be in other insects and arthropods. Mutually exclusive alternate exon use is known in other genes, most notably tropomyosin genes from mammals, chicken, and Drosophila (33McKeown M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 133-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 34Barbas J.A. Galceran J. Torroja L. Prado A. Ferrus A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1433-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In such genes there are two to four alternate exons, usually with a constitutive, default exon choice and an alternate selected under regulation of cell-specific splicing machinery. Correct splicing of the M. sexta serpin-1 pre-mRNA requires precise selection of only one exon 9 out of 12 choices. This must involve regulation by splicing factors at the level of recognition of exon 9 sequences and exclusion of more than one exon 9 sequence between exons 8 and 10. Sequences of serpin-1 cDNA clones indicate that all of the alternate exon 9 variants in the gene are present in serpin-1 mRNAs and that they are spliced in mature mRNA in a mutually exclusive manner. With only one exception, in which a cDNA contained exon 9B spliced to exon 9C followed by exon 10 (8Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 55-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have found that serpin-1 mRNAs contain only a single exon 9 sequence. Differences in the sequences at exon 9-intron borders compared with other exons in the gene (Fig. 6) might be signals for regulation of the splicing process. From the analysis of the alignments of nucleic acid sequences of the exon 9 variants and alignments of the amino acid sequences they encode (Fig. 7, Fig. 8) we propose that an ancestor of serpin gene-1 contained a single exon 9 that was duplicated. These may have been the precursors of exons 9A and 9Z. Further duplication events led to exons 9B and 9K and insertion of an additional codon for proline at the carboxyl terminus. From an ancestor of 9K diverged the remaining exons, all with a four-codon insertion at the carboxyl-terminal end of the reactive site loop. The tree then forms two branches, one with exon 9C and another with 9J as the last common ancestor. The most recent duplications involve exons 9D, 9E, 9F, 9G, 9H, and 9I, all near the center of the exon 9 region, with duplication of 9E and 9F as a pair to produce 9G and 9H. Of course this speculation about evolution is based only on the observable structure of the gene from a single specimen of a contemporary M. sexta. The actual path by which the exon 9 variants arose may actually have been more complex. It is likely that duplication of these exons has occurred through unequal crossing over. At each such event one daughter chromosome would have more copies of exon 9, and the other would have fewer. Furthermore, once multiple copies of the exon were present, several copies could be gained or lost at each instance of unequal crossing over. It seems likely that change in the number of copies of exon 9 in serpin gene-1 is a continuing process and that individuals from different populations could have a serpin gene-1 structure distinct from the one we have characterized. It will be necessary to examine the structure of serpin gene-1 from different M. sexta strains and from other Manduca species to understand more fully the evolution and population genetics of this gene. Why does M. sexta need so many different proteinase inhibitors? The physiological roles of serpins in insects have not yet been established. We have expressed the serpin-1 variants as recombinant proteins and found proteinase inhibitor activity for 11 of the 12 reactive sites. 3H. Jiang and M. R. Kanost, unpublished results. The individual variants can inhibit enzymes with chymotrypsin-, elastase-, or trypsin-like specificities. Serpins in insect hemolymph might inhibit proteinases produced by pathogenic microorganisms. This role has been postulated for families of serpins in mice (2Hill R.E. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1987; 326: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 4Kanost M.R. Jiang H. New Directions in Invertebrate Immunology. SOS Publications, Fair Haven, NJ1996Google Scholar). Another potential function for these inhibitors is regulation of endogenous serine proteinases in hemolymph. Proteinase zymogens are present in plasma, and others may be released from hemocytes in inflammation-like responses. We have cloned cDNAs for five different serine proteinases expressed by M. sexta hemocytes, and we have identified biochemically several different proteinase activities in hemolymph plasma. 4H. Jiang, Y. Wang, and M. R. Kanost, unpublished results. Some of the serine proteinases in insect hemolymph are involved in a cascade that leads to activation of hemolymph prophenoloxidase (6Sugumaran M. Kanost M.R. Beckage N.E. Thompson S.N. Federici B.A. Parasites and Pathogens of Insects. Academic Press, New York1993: 317-342Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Phenoloxidase activation occurs in response to wounding and bacterial or fungal infection. The quinones and melanin resulting from phenoloxidase activity appear to be components of a protective response to microbial infection in insects. Regulating this pathway may be an important role of some of the serpin-1 variants. Thus, the inhibitors produced from M. sexta serpin gene-1 may participate in several physiological functions related to wound healing and antimicrobial defense. It is also quite likely that these serpins inhibit endogenous proteinases involved in processes in insect physiology which have not yet been discovered.

This pathway includes the activation of several protein-tyrosine kinases such as Lyn, Syk, Btk, and Fak that induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins (1Benhamou M. Gutkind J.S.

Cell Signalling. 1995; 7: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). There is also stimulation of phospholipase A2, C, and D, the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular and extracellular sources and activation of serine and threonine kinases (4Beaven M.A. Metzger H.

Immunol. Rev. 1992; 125: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of FcϵRIβ and the cytoplasmic domain of FcϵRIγ appear to be important in receptor-mediated signal transduction (7Alber G. Miller L. Jelsema C.L. Varin-Blank N. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22613-22620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8905-8909Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These transducing subunits contain a cytoplasmic motif with the amino acid sequence (D/E)X2YX2LX6-7YX2(L/I) that is critical for cell activation (9Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar, 10Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu. Rev.

This motif called ITAM (for Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motif) (12Cambier J.C. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) is present in the β and γ subunits of FcϵRI, in the ζ subunit of the T-cell receptor complex, and in Igα and Igβ of the B-cell receptor. This motif contains all the structural information essential for signal transduction and is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated after receptor aggregation (11Cambier J.C. Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R. Annu.

Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 3729-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues appears to be necessary as mutants where the tyrosines are replaced with phenylalanine are inactive (16Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Science. 1992; 255: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 17Amigorena S. Bonnerot C. Drake J.R. Choquet D. Hunziker W. Guillet J.G. Webster P. Sautes C. Mellman I. Fridman W.H.

Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 457-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). After receptor aggregation, a Syk/ZAP-70 family protein tyrosine kinase associates with these receptors and is critical for the downstream activation signals (10Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9107-9111Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).Fusion proteins containing the two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of Syk bind preferentially to the tyrosine-phosphorylated γ subunit of FcϵRI, whereas a fusion protein containing the single Lyn SH2 domain binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated FcϵRIβ (22Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22427-22432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Shiue L. Green J. Green O.M. Karas J.L. Morgenstern J.P. Ram M.K. Taylor M.K. Zoller M.J. Zydowsky L.D. Bolen J.B. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 272-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to better understand signal transduction from the FcϵRI, we used synthetic peptides based on the ITAM sequences of the β and γ subunits of FcϵRI to investigate the interaction of molecules that may be involved in downstream propagation. We observed an association of Syk predominantly with the tyrosine-phosphorylated γ ITAM, whereas Lyn, Shc, Grb2, and PLCγ1 interacted with the ITAM of FcϵRIβ. The binding of distinct downstream effector molecules to the different ITAMs may be critical in the activation of distinct signaling pathways from the different receptor subunits.DISCUSSIONOne of the earliest events after aggregation of FcϵRI is the activation of kinases that result in the rapid phosphorylation on Tyr and Ser of the β subunit of the receptor and on Tyr and Thr of the γ subunit (36Paolini R. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1991; 353: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation on tyrosines of the ITAM in these subunits then recruits other proteins that are crucial for propagating the intracellular signals. The binding of such proteins is mediated by SH2 domains present on many proteins involved in signal transduction (35Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). The specificity of SH2 domains for phosphorylated tyrosines (37Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) would explain the selectivity of the interactions of Syk, Lyn, PLCγ1, and Shc with the β and γ subunits of the FcϵRI. Binding of these downstream signaling molecules then can result in conformational changes and in their activation (25Kimura T. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1471-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 38Johnson S.A. Pleiman C.M. Pao L. Schneringer J. Hippen K. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4596-4603PubMed Google Scholar).The present results further refine the model for FcϵRI-induced activation of mast cells. Aggregation of the receptor results in the activation of Lyn which then tyrosine phosphorylates the β and γ subunits of the receptor. Syk is then recruited and activated by binding to the γ subunit of the receptor. PLCγ1 is recruited to the β subunit of the receptor, bringing it in close proximity to Syk where it could be efficiently tyrosine phosphorylated. Previous experiments suggest that both the β and γ subunits of FcϵRI contribute to signal transduction. Chimeric proteins have been expressed in RBL-2H3 cells that contain the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD25 fused with the carboxyl-terminal domain of either the γ or β subunits of FcϵRI (8Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8905-8909Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 34Jouvin M.-H.E. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Valle A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol.

Whereas there is some secretion by aggregation of the chimeric proteins that contain the γ domain, there is minimal if any by the β containing chimeras. Furthermore, signaling by the chimeric proteins containing the γ sequence is less than through the normal FcϵRI, suggesting that the β subunit is important for signal transduction. The present results suggest an explanation for such observations requiring cooperation between the two receptor subunits in inducing secretion in mast cells.The much stronger binding of Syk with the γ than with the β ITAM-diphosphorylated peptides is probably due to the fine structural differences in the sequence of the ITAM of these two molecules. There is also one less amino acid between the two tyrosines in the β motif. By membrane binding studies, the best binding to ITAM peptides was with fusion proteins containing both SH2 domains of Syk expressed in tandem. These results strongly suggest that the two SH2 domains of Syk and phosphorylation of both tyrosines in the ITAMs are necessary for optimal binding. The recently described crystal structure of ZAP-70 associated with the phosphorylated ITAM of ζ T cell receptor supports this model for binding (41Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The binding of Syk/ZAP-70 tyrosine kinases to the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM peptides results in their activation and tyrosine phosphorylation (25Kimura T. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1471-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 42Shiue L. Zoller M.J. Brugge J.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11590-11594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The interaction of Syk with the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM results in a conformational change (25Kimura T. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1471-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and an increase in its kinase activity (42Shiue L. Zoller M.J. Brugge J.S. J. Biol.

These conformational changes in Syk and increased enzymatic activity are probably critical for downstream propagation of intracellular signals in both mast cells and B cells (20Benhamou M.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Lyn, a member of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases, is associated with FcϵRI in both non-stimulated and activated cells (30Eiseman E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 31Minoguchi K. Swaim W.D. Berenstein E.H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 11246-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The present precipitation results suggest that after cell activation the interaction of Lyn is predominantly with the β subunit. There is association of Lyn with the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the β subunit which contains the ITAM, although mutation of one of the Tyr to Phe does not decrease this association (34Jouvin M.-H.E. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Valle A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5918-5925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a fusion protein containing only the SH2 domain of Lyn precipitates and binds with the tyrosine-phosphorylated β subunit and with the phosphorylated ITAM. These data suggest that the SH2 domain of Lyn can potentially bind the phosphorylated ITAM, but in the intact Lyn this SH2 site is not available due to intramolecular interaction with its regulatory domain. Stimulation of cells and activation of Lyn could result in dephosphorylation of these regulatory sites and the release of the SH2 domain for binding to the phosphorylated subunits of FcϵRI that are in close proximity. This can explain the increased association of Lyn with FcϵRI after cell stimulation (32Yamashita T. Mao S. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11251-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, Lyn is tyrosine phosphorylated to the same extent in non-stimulated compared to stimulated cells, suggesting that there may be rapid rephosphorylation of these regulatory sites. Therefore, Lyn association with FcϵRI in activated cells is probably mediated by SH2 domain binding.Ligand binding to receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor or the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, induces receptor oligomerization and autophosphorylation, generating docking sites for PLCγ1 (47Kumjian D.A. Wahl M.I. Rhee S.G. Daniel T.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8232-8236Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). PLCγ1 can also associate with ITAM-containing receptors such as the T cell receptor (48Dasgupta J.D. Granja C. Druker B. Lin L.L. Yunis E.J. Relias V. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). PLCγ1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated after FcϵRI activation (49Park D.J. Min H.K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24237-24240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Li W. Deanin G.G. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Oliver J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3176-3182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and translocates to the membrane (51Atkinson T.P. Kaliner M.A. Hohman R.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2194-2200PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation activates PLCγ1 inducing it to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to produce two second messengers, inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, these in turn result in the increase in intracellular Ca2+ and the activation of protein kinase C (52Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar). PLCγ1 associates with a tyrosine kinase after FcϵRI aggregation (53Fukamachi H. Kawakami Y. Takei M. Ishizaka T. Ishizaka K. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9524-9528Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and a complex containing Syk, PLCγ1, and a 120-kDa phosphoprotein has been seen in B-cells (54Sidorenko S.P. Law C.L. Chandran K.A. Clark E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This 120-kDa protein has been postulated to be a bridge between Syk and PLCγ1. Similarly, fusion proteins containing the SH2 domains of PLCγ1 bind tyrosine-phosphorylated Syk (55Sillman A.L. Monroe J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11806-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the present experiments suggest direct interaction of PLCγ1 with the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM of FcϵRIβ on the basis of both precipitation and membrane binding studies. Furthermore, the γPP peptide precipitated Syk, but there was no detectable PLCγ1. PLCγ1 has two SH2 domains, one SH3, and two split pleckstrin homology domains. The interaction between PLCγ1 and the phosphorylated FcϵRIβ ITAM is SH2-mediated, whereas the pleckstrin homology domains may play a role in other membrane interactions.Tyrosine-phosphorylated β ITAM peptide precipitated Shc and Grb2, two members of a family of adaptor molecules that have SH2 domains. Stimulation of T cell and B cell antigen receptors results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and the formation of a complex that contains Shc, Grb2, and Sos (56Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Songyang Z.

Grb2 is another adaptor molecule with an SH2 domain that binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc. The single SH2 domain of Grb2 is flanked by two SH3 domains. One of the SH3 domains binds Sos1, the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and thus the complex can activate the Ras pathway (59Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R.

This pathway includes the activation of several protein-tyrosine kinases such as Lyn, Syk, Btk, and Fak that induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins (1Benhamou M. Gutkind J.S.

The COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of FcϵRIβ and the cytoplasmic domain of FcϵRIγ appear to be important in receptor-mediated signal transduction (7Alber G. Miller L. Jelsema C.L. Varin-Blank N.

This motif contains all the structural information essential for signal transduction and is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated after receptor aggregation (11Cambier J.C. Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R. Annu.

Therefore, to better understand signal transduction from the FcϵRI, we used synthetic peptides based on the ITAM sequences of the β and γ subunits of FcϵRI to investigate the interaction of molecules that may be involved in downstream propagation. We observed an association of Syk predominantly with the tyrosine-phosphorylated γ ITAM, whereas Lyn, Shc, Grb2, and PLCγ1 interacted with the ITAM of FcϵRIβ.

INTRODUCTIONThe earliest recognized stage in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques is the formation of the arterial fatty streak resulting from the accumulation of foam cells beneath the endothelium. Most foam cells arise from monocyte-derived macrophages that have become embedded under the endothelium and have been loaded with cholesterol esters. Goldstein and co-workers (1Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K.

This “scavenger” receptor was found to take up chemically modified LDL at a high rate and in an apparently unregulated manner, suggesting it may be responsible for the accumulation of cholesterol and cholesterol esters by endothelial macrophages leading to their conversion to foam cells. It has since been established that oxidation (in vitro) converts LDL to a form recognized by the scavenger receptor (2Steinbrecher U.P. Witztum J.L. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 1: 135-143Crossref Google Scholar). It has been suggested further that the key change to LDL resulting from exposure to oxidative conditions is the formation of lipid/protein conjugates (3Steinbrecher U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3603-3608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of oxidized (in vitro) LDL have demonstrated the formation of reactive lipid products, including 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) which was found to have the highest capacity for covalent modification of LDL among the peroxidation products studied (4Esterbauer H. Jürgens G. Quehenberger O. Koller E. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 495-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Evidence conclusively locating lipid/protein conjugation in oxidized LDL has, however, hitherto been lacking. In a previous study with a model protein, apomyoglobin, we established that histidine residues were the principal sites of stable adduct formation with HNE (13Bolgar M.S. Gaskell S.J. Anal.

The primary sequence has been determined (14Chen S.-H. Yang C.-Y. Chen P.-F. Setzer D. Tanimura M. Li W.-H. Gotto A.M. Chan L. J. Biol.

Characterization of structural modifications of apoB-100 represents a formidable analytical problem. Proteolytic digestion of the protein generates peptides of a size amenable to characterization, but the complexity of the hydrolysate is such that isolation of individual constituents is extremely laborious (16Yang C.-Y. Chen S.-H. Gianturco S.H. Bradley W.A. Sparrow J.T. Tanimura M. Li W.H. Sparrow D.A. DeLoof H. Rosseneu M. Lee F.-S. Gu Z.-W. Gotto A.M. Chan L. Nature. 1986; 323: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). (For example, hydrolysis using trypsin should produce 497 peptides.) Furthermore, in structurally modified LDL, the complexity of the hydrolysate is further increased, and the modified peptides (incorporating nonconventional amino acid residues) are not amenable to complete structural characterization by conventional N-terminal sequence analysis.We have therefore developed tandem mass spectrometric procedures to recognize and characterize peptides containing HNE-modified histidine residues of apoB-100. Precursor ion scanning allowed the selective detection of peptides containing HNE-modified histidine residues present in a complex mixture of other tryptic peptides. The ability to screen mixtures for components containing the targeted modification allowed the use of a single simple HPLC fractionation step; isolation of individual components was unnecessary. The modified peptides, which were often present as minor components in a complex mixture, were then sequenced by product ion analysis without further purification.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES40 mg of LDL was isolated according to standard procedures (17Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 43: 1345-1353Crossref Scopus (6460) Google Scholar) and oxidized for 24 h at 37°C in oxygen-saturated 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5.5 μM CuSO4. 10 ml of the 2 mg/ml LDL suspension obtained after oxidation was cooled to 0°C and buffered to pH 7.3 with 1 M potassium phosphate. Reduction was performed by the addition of 0.1 g of NaBH4, and the resulting precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation. The precipitated LDL was delipidated by washing with CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1). The delipidated protein was resuspended in 8 ml of 0.1 M NH4CO3, 1 mM CaCl2, pH 8.4, to which was added 0.32 mg of trypsin (Sigma). The suspension was stirred and maintained at 37°C for 18 h. Portions (1 ml) of the digest solution were subjected to reverse-phase separation using an Analyst HPLC system (Perkin-Elmer) with UV detection at 217 nm. Separation was achieved using a Partisil C18 2.1 × 150 mm column (Keystone Scientific) and gradient elution. HPLC fractions were collected over 1 min into 1.5 ml polypropylene tubes. The fractions from four HPLC analyses were combined and dried. The HPLC fractions were redissolved in 50 μl of H2O:CH3CN 1:1 with 0.1% formic acid. The sample solutions were infused at 2 μl/min into a Quattro mass spectrometer, upgraded to Quattro II specifications (Micromass, Manchester, UK).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe tryptic hydrolysate of apoB-100 derived from oxidized low density lipoprotein following reduction with NaBH4 was fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC. The prior reduction step was included to stabilize the product formed by Michael addition of HNE to histidine; experiments with model proteins have established that the conditions employed for tryptic digestion may lead to reversal of the initial addition reaction. 2M. S. Bolgar and S. J. Gaskell, unpublished results. The chromatogram was extremely complex (data not shown), as expected from the prediction of nearly 500 tryptic fragments of apoB-100. HPLC fractions (1 min) were collected and analyzed by conventional electrospray ionization MS and by tandem MS with scanning for precursors of m/z 268, where m/z 268 corresponds to the histidine immonium ion modified by the addition of an HNE moiety followed by a 2-hydrogen atom reduction (Structure I).A previous study established that scanning for precursors of the HNE-modified histidine immonium ion is an effective procedure for the selective detection of peptides containing this modification (13Bolgar M.S. Gaskell S.J. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 2325-2330Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The conventional mass spectrum obtained from one fraction (37; Fig. 1A) included many abundant ions which were readily assigned to native tryptic peptides. In contrast, the spectrum of precursors of m/z 268 (Fig. 1B) contained only one ion at high relative abundance, m/z 658.3. The initial stage of interpretation consisted of comparing the m/z values of the ions in the precursor spectrum with those values calculated for the predicted tryptic peptides of native apoB-100 and apoB-100 where every histidine residue was replaced with a reduced HNE-adducted histidine residue. For tryptic peptides which contained more than one histidine residue, values were calculated with all possible combinations of native and adducted residues. The m/z values of the (M + nH)n+ ions with n = 1-5 were calculated for each peptide. The ion at m/z 658.3 in the precursor ion spectrum from fraction 37 corresponded to the predicted value for the (M + 2H)2+ ion from tryptic fragment T430 containing a single HNE-adducted histidine residue. The predicted value m/z for the (M + 3H)3+ ion was 439.2, and an ion was detected in the precursor ion spectrum at approximately the correct m/z value (439.8) for the (M + 3H)3+ ion but with very low signal-to-noise. The experimentally determined molecular mass for the adducted peptide was 1314.6 Da (using only the value of the (M + 2H)2+ ion) which was in precise agreement with the theoretical value for HNE-adducted T430. Product ion spectra were recorded for the ions of m/z 658.3 and 439.2 to confirm the presence of HNE-adducted T430. The product ion spectrum obtained from the triply protonated ion at m/z 439.2 (Fig. 1C) contained sufficient structural information to confirm the sequence of 8 of the 10 residues. The product ion spectrum obtained from the doubly protonated ion at m/z 658.3 (Fig. 1D) contained a complete set of C-terminal fragment ions which confirmed the entire amino acid sequence including the presence of an HNE-adducted histidine, third from the C terminus of T430, and corresponding to amino acid residue 3960 in apoB-100. Additional apoB-100 tryptic peptides containing HNE-adducted histidine residues were detected in other HPLC fractions.

INTRODUCTIONThe earliest recognized stage in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques is the formation of the arterial fatty streak resulting from the accumulation of foam cells beneath the endothelium. Most foam cells arise from monocyte-derived macrophages that have become embedded under the endothelium and have been loaded with cholesterol esters. Goldstein and co-workers (1Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K.

This “scavenger” receptor was found to take up chemically modified LDL at a high rate and in an apparently unregulated manner, suggesting it may be responsible for the accumulation of cholesterol and cholesterol esters by endothelial macrophages leading to their conversion to foam cells. It has since been established that oxidation (in vitro) converts LDL to a form recognized by the scavenger receptor (2Steinbrecher U.P. Witztum J.L. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 1: 135-143Crossref Google Scholar). It has been suggested further that the key change to LDL resulting from exposure to oxidative conditions is the formation of lipid/protein conjugates (3Steinbrecher U.P. J. Biol.

Studies of oxidized (in vitro) LDL have demonstrated the formation of reactive lipid products, including 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) which was found to have the highest capacity for covalent modification of LDL among the peroxidation products studied (4Esterbauer H.

Furthermore, in structurally modified LDL, the complexity of the hydrolysate is further increased, and the modified peptides (incorporating nonconventional amino acid residues) are not amenable to complete structural characterization by conventional N-terminal sequence analysis.We have therefore developed tandem mass spectrometric procedures to recognize and characterize peptides containing HNE-modified histidine residues of apoB-100. Precursor ion scanning allowed the selective detection of peptides containing HNE-modified histidine residues present in a complex mixture of other tryptic peptides. The ability to screen mixtures for components containing the targeted modification allowed the use of a single simple HPLC fractionation step; isolation of individual components was unnecessary.

Invest. 1955; 43: 1345-1353Crossref Scopus (6460) Google Scholar) and oxidized for 24 h at 37°C in oxygen-saturated 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5.5 μM CuSO4. 10 ml of the 2 mg/ml LDL suspension obtained after oxidation was cooled to 0°C and buffered to pH 7.3 with 1 M potassium phosphate. Reduction was performed by the addition of 0.1 g of NaBH4, and the resulting precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation. The precipitated LDL was delipidated by washing with CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1). The delipidated protein was resuspended in 8 ml of 0.1 M NH4CO3, 1 mM CaCl2, pH 8.4, to which was added 0.32 mg of trypsin (Sigma). The suspension was stirred and maintained at 37°C for 18 h. Portions (1 ml) of the digest solution were subjected to reverse-phase separation using an Analyst HPLC system (Perkin-Elmer) with UV detection at 217 nm. Separation was achieved using a Partisil C18 2.1 × 150 mm column (Keystone Scientific) and gradient elution. HPLC fractions were collected over 1 min into 1.5 ml polypropylene tubes. The fractions from four HPLC analyses were combined and dried. The HPLC fractions were redissolved in 50 μl of H2O:CH3CN 1:1 with 0.1% formic acid.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe tryptic hydrolysate of apoB-100 derived from oxidized low density lipoprotein following reduction with NaBH4 was fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC. The prior reduction step was included to stabilize the product formed by Michael addition of HNE to histidine; experiments with model proteins have established that the conditions employed for tryptic digestion may lead to reversal of the initial addition reaction. 2M. S. Bolgar and S. J. Gaskell, unpublished results. The chromatogram was extremely complex (data not shown), as expected from the prediction of nearly 500 tryptic fragments of apoB-100. HPLC fractions (1 min) were collected and analyzed by conventional electrospray ionization MS and by tandem MS with scanning for precursors of m/z 268, where m/z 268 corresponds to the histidine immonium ion modified by the addition of an HNE moiety followed by a 2-hydrogen atom reduction (Structure I).A previous study established that scanning for precursors of the HNE-modified histidine immonium ion is an effective procedure for the selective detection of peptides containing this modification (13Bolgar M.S. Gaskell S.J. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 2325-2330Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The conventional mass spectrum obtained from one fraction (37; Fig. 1A) included many abundant ions which were readily assigned to native tryptic peptides. In contrast, the spectrum of precursors of m/z 268 (Fig. 1B) contained only one ion at high relative abundance, m/z 658.3. The initial stage of interpretation consisted of comparing the m/z values of the ions in the precursor spectrum with those values calculated for the predicted tryptic peptides of native apoB-100 and apoB-100 where every histidine residue was replaced with a reduced HNE-adducted histidine residue. For tryptic peptides which contained more than one histidine residue, values were calculated with all possible combinations of native and adducted residues. The m/z values of the (M + nH)n+ ions with n = 1-5 were calculated for each peptide. The ion at m/z 658.3 in the precursor ion spectrum from fraction 37 corresponded to the predicted value for the (M + 2H)2+ ion from tryptic fragment T430 containing a single HNE-adducted histidine residue. The predicted value m/z for the (M + 3H)3+ ion was 439.2, and an ion was detected in the precursor ion spectrum at approximately the correct m/z value (439.8) for the (M + 3H)3+ ion but with very low signal-to-noise. The experimentally determined molecular mass for the adducted peptide was 1314.6 Da (using only the value of the (M + 2H)2+ ion) which was in precise agreement with the theoretical value for HNE-adducted T430. Product ion spectra were recorded for the ions of m/z 658.3 and 439.2 to confirm the presence of HNE-adducted T430. The product ion spectrum obtained from the triply protonated ion at m/z 439.2 (Fig. 1C) contained sufficient structural information to confirm the sequence of 8 of the 10 residues. The product ion spectrum obtained from the doubly protonated ion at m/z 658.3 (Fig. 1D) contained a complete set of C-terminal fragment ions which confirmed the entire amino acid sequence including the presence of an HNE-adducted histidine, third from the C terminus of T430, and corresponding to amino acid residue 3960 in apoB-100.

In summary, we have conclusively demonstrated the addition of HNE to apoB-100 following oxidation of LDL, providing the first direct evidence for the significance of lipid/protein conjugation. The approach used here for the detection of HNE adduction is substantially more informative than methodology in which the protein is hydrolyzed to individual amino acids followed by an assay for HNE-adducted histidine. By identifying and mapping the tryptic peptides containing HNE-adducted histidine residues onto the apoB-100 sequence, a connectivity is established between the adducted residue and the protein of origin; this can be achieved without exhaustive purification of the protein. Furthermore, the assignment of modified residues to specific locations that have been previously shown to reside on the surface of the LDL particle has implications for receptor recognition of the oxidized protein."
https://openalex.org/W1991869287,"To dissect tumor necrosis factor receptor (Tnfr)-1 (CD120a) and Tnfr2 (CD120b)-dependent signal transduction pathways, primary fibroblasts isolated from inguinal adipose tissue of wild type (wt), tnfr1o, tnfr2o, and tnfr1o/tnfr2o mice were studied. The mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1 and Erk2 were found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated by Tnf treatment in all wt, tnfr1o, and tnfr2o fibroblasts; the activation was down-regulated 60 min after the start of steady state Tnf treatment. Distinct kinetics of Erk1 and Erk2 activation were detected; the Tnfr1-mediated activation of Erk1 and Erk2 started more slowly and persisted for more prolonged times as compared with Tnfr2 activation. Raf-1, Raf-B, Mek-1, Mek kinase, and p90rsk kinases were also shown to be activated independently in a distinct time-dependent pattern through the two Tnf receptors. In addition, both Tnfr1 and Tnfr2 mediated independently the activation of the transcription factor Ap-1 albeit with parallel activation kinetics. In contrast, Tnfr1 exclusively mediated activation of NF-κB and fibroblast proliferation; however, Tnfr2 enhanced proliferation triggered through Tnfr1. These findings indicate distinct but also overlapping roles of Tnfr1 and Tnfr2 in primary mouse fibroblasts and suggest different regulation mechanisms of signal transduction pathways under the control of both Tnf receptors.

Tnfα activities are elicited by binding to at least two distinct surface receptors of 55 kDa (Tnfr1, CD120a) and 75 kDa (Tnfr2, CD120b), which are ubiquitously coexpressed on almost all cell types in various proportions (reviewed in Refs. 1Beutler B.

Homozygous tnfr1o/tnfr2o double knock out mice were generated by cross-breeding tnfr1o and tnfr2o mice and subsequent screening of the offspring tail DNA by polymerase chain reaction using primers specific for tnfr1o and tnfr2o mice as previously reported. Wild type (C57BL/6 × 129/Sv), tnfr1o (C57BL/6 × 129/Sv-tnfr1o), tnfr2o (C57BL/6 × 129/Sv-tnfr2o), and tnfr1o/tnfr2o mice (C57BL/6 × 129/Sv-tnfr1o/tnfr2o), either males or females, were sacrificed at the age of 6-8 weeks. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Map kinase R2 (Erk1-CT; recognizing Erk1 and Erk2 independent of phosphorylation state), rabbit polyclonal anti-Map kinase R3 (erk1-NT; recognizing Erk1), and mouse monoclonal anti-Map kinase antibodies (erk2; recognizing Erk2) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Mek-1, anti-Mekk, anti-Raf-1, anti-Raf-B, and anti-p90rsk antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to tyrosine-phosphorylated Erk1 and Erk2 (phospho-Mapk) were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibodies, [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol), [γ-33P]ATP (2000-3000 Ci/mmol), and [methyl-3H]thymidine (5 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Corp.

Pepstatin A, leupeptin-hemisulfate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), sodium fluoride, and dithiothreitol (DTT) were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), benzamidine, sodium pyrophosphate, and myelin basic protein (Mbp) were from Sigma. Aprotinin and sodium orthovanadate were purchased from Bayer (Leverkusen, Germany) and BDH (Poole, United Kingdom), respectively. Recombinant mouse Tnfα produced in Escherichia coli was kindly provided by H. J. Schoenfeld, B. Wipf, and U. Ettlin (Hoffmann-La Roche). Recombinant hIL-1α was a gift from R. Chizzonite (Hoffmann-La Roche). The preparation of mouse fibroblasts was performed as described by Mackay et al. (24Mackay F. Rothe J. Bluethmann H. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5274-5284PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxia, and inguinal adipose pads were isolated and rinsed with DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Adipose tissue was cut into small pieces, washed once at room temperature with DMEM, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% collagenase type I (Sigma). The suspension was incubated for 1 h at 37°C under agitation and finally homogenized using a loose-fitting Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was filtered through a 100-μm nylon mesh and centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 rpm, 4°C. Fibroblasts, localized to the pellet, were washed twice and then cultured in DMEM/F12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 20% human serum (SRK Blutspendezentrum, Bern, Switzerland), 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine. Cellular homogeneity of the cultures was controlled by flow cytometry analysis using a rat anti-mouse reticular fibroblast antibody (ER-TR7; Bachem, Torrance, CA). The primary fibroblasts were used at passages three to seven for assays. Mouse fibroblasts were incubated in 96-well microtiter plates in 100 μl of medium at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well with increasing amounts of recombinant mouse Tnfα (mTnfα) (0.1-100 ng/ml). After 48 h of culture at 37°C, cells were pulsed for 12 h with 1 μCi/well [methyl-3H]thymidine and harvested using an LKB cell harvester. Incorporated radioactivity was measured in a Betaplate liquid scintillation counter (Pharmacia LKB, Uppsala, Sweden). Each assay was performed in triplicate. Nuclear extracts from 1 × 106 fibroblasts, which had been either stimulated for various periods with mTnfα (10 ng/ml) or hIL-1α (10 ng/ml), or left untreated, were prepared as described by Dignam et al. (50Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9129) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were harvested after trypsin-EDTA detachment, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 500 μl of a hypotonic lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM DTT). After 30 min incubation on ice, nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 6500 rpm for 4 min at 4°C, resuspended in three pellet volumes of high salt buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM DTT), and kept on ice for 1 h. Lysates were centrifuged (5 min, 6500 rpm, 4°C), and supernatants containing nuclear proteins were diluted in 3 volumes of low salt buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 M KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM DTT). The protein concentration of nuclear extracts was determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed by incubating nuclear extracts containing 10 μg of total nuclear protein with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) and 30 μg of bovine serum albumin in binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol) in a total volume of 15 μl for 20 min at room temperature. As NF-κB probe, a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing two tandemly arranged κB elements of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat (5′-ATCAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCG-3′) was used. A double-stranded oligomer containing a single consensus binding site (5′-AGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCG-3′) served as a specific Ap-1 probe. About 6 × 104 cpm of the 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotides were added to the preincubated nuclear extracts, and the reaction mixtures were further incubated for 15 min at room temperature. An unrelated oligonucleotide (5′-AGGATGGGAAGTGTGTGATATATCCTTGAT-3′) and an oligonucleotide with a single nucleotide deletion (5′-AGCTTGATGGTCAGCCG-3′) were included as controls in the NF-κB and Ap-1 assays, respectively. The samples were then analyzed by electrophoresis through a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TAE buffer (40 mM Tris acetate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films under standard conditions. Autoradiograms were analyzed with a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Mouse primary fibroblasts were seeded in 100 × 20-mm polystyrene tissue culture dishes (Falcon) and were allowed to grow to 80% confluency (about 1 × 106 cells total). Cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated for 3 days with medium containing 0.25% fetal calf serum (DMEM/F12, 0.25% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine) to render cells quiescent before being treated as indicated. After stimulation, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 14 μM pepstatin A, 100 μM leupeptin, 3 mM benzamidine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM sodium orthovanadate, 100 units/ml aprotinin, and 100 mM sodium fluoride) for 30 min at 4°C. The cell lysates were centrifuged (10 min, 70000 rpm, 4°C) in a Beckman Microfuge, and supernatants were recovered. The protein concentration of lysates was determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Equal amounts of cell lysate protein (typically 25 μg total protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE in Mini-Protean Electrophoresis cells (Bio-Rad) using the Laemmli buffer system (51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205463) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P membranes, Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking of free binding sites with 5% defatted milk powder in blocking buffer (TBS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with appropriate concentrations of first antibodies in TBS followed by a 1-2-h incubation with HRP-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibodies at room temperature. The membranes were then washed and subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Corp.) under standard conditions. The Mbp-SDS-PAGE kinase assays were performed as described by Vietor et al. (49Vietor I. Schwenger P. Li W. Schlessinger J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18994-18999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cell lysates containing aliquots of 20 μg of total protein were electrophoretically separated in 10.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1 mg/ml Mbp (Sigma) co-polymerized in the running gel. Gels were washed for 1 h in two changes of buffer A (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 20% isopropyl alcohol, followed by an incubation in buffer A for 1 h. The proteins in the gels were denatured for 1 h with two changes of buffer A containing 6 M guanidine HCl and finally renatured for 12-16 h at 4°C in buffer A containing 0.04% Tween 40. To perform kinase assays, the gels were preincubated in kinase reaction buffer (buffer B, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 90 μM sodium orthovanadate, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 30°C and incubated for 1 h at 30°C in buffer B containing 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The gels were washed extensively with a buffer containing 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate, dried, and analyzed by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Equal amounts of cell lysates used for immunoprecipitation were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (3 × 20 min on ice). Aliquots of 30 μg of total protein of the precleared extracts were incubated with 1 μg of the respective antibodies in a final volume of 100 μl for 20 min at 4°C under agitation. 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (diluted 1:1 in lysis buffer) were added (20 min, 4°C, under agitation), and the immunocomplexes were centrifuged in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge (20 s, high speed). The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgAc. The kinase activity was assayed by resuspending the beads with bound immunocomplexes in 20 μl of Mbp substrate solution (4 mg/ml) and 20 μl of reaction buffer (10 μM ATP, 40 mM MgCl2, 40 mM HEPES) supplemented with 5 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP and subsequent incubation under agitation (30 min, 30°C). The kinase reaction was stopped with 40 μl of 2 × Laemmli's sample buffer containing DTT. The samples were heated to 95°C for 4 min and then subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. The labeled Mbp substrate was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis of the dried gels. To dissect the activity of the two Tnf receptors in proliferation, primary mouse fibroblasts from wild type (wt) and homozygous tnfr1o or tnfr2o mice were stimulated for 48 h with various amounts of mTnfα, and thymidine incorporation was measured. Confirming previous studies (24Mackay F. Rothe J. Bluethmann H. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5274-5284PubMed Google Scholar, 52Vilcek J. Palombella V.J. Henriksen-DeStefano D. Swenson C. Feinman R. Hirai M. Tsujimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 632-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), proliferation of wt fibroblasts was stimulated by mTnfα, reaching a maximum at about 5-10 ng/ml mTnfα (Fig. 1). tnfr2o fibroblasts similarly showed enhanced proliferation with mTnfα stimulation, but the maximal proliferative response achieved was reproducibly lower than with wt fibroblasts. In contrast, mTnfα had no effect on tnfr1o fibroblast proliferation (Fig. 1). These findings confirm that Tnfr1 is essential in mediating proliferative signals, whereas Tnfr2 engagement merely enhances proliferation triggered through Tnfr1 (24Mackay F. Rothe J. Bluethmann H. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5274-5284PubMed Google Scholar). Several previous studies had attributed NF-κB activation by Tnf to Tnfr1 signaling, but in some cell lines NF-κB activation was also reported to be under Tnfr2 control (16Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T.

To investigate the role of Tnfr1 and Tnfr2 in NF-κB activation in the present cell systems, primary wt and Tnfr-deficient fibroblasts were stimulated for 15 and 30 min with predetermined optimal doses of mTnfα, and equal amounts of nuclear protein extracts were tested for activated and translocated NF-κB in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). NF-κB was found strongly activated by mTnfα treatment in wt fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). In contrast, mTnfα completely failed to activate NF-κB in tnfr1o fibroblasts (Fig. 2B), confirming similar results with other cells from tnfr1o mice (16Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kuendig T.M.

However, NF-κB could be activated in tnfr1o fibroblasts by hIL-1α treatment, demonstrating that NF-κB activation in general was not affected. Tnfα stimulation of tnfr2o fibroblasts resulted in NF-κB activation (Fig. 2C); for a more qua"

To examine their post-translational modifications, 40 S subunit proteins purified from Rat-1 fibroblasts and their peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry. Of 41 proteins observed, 36 corresponded to the 32 rat 40 S ribosomal proteins with known sequences (S3, S5, S7, and S24 presented in two forms). The observed masses of S4, S6-S8, S13, S15a, S16, S17, S19, S27a, S29, and S30 matched those predicted. Sa, S3a, S5, S11, S15, S18, S20, S21, S24, S26-S28, and an S7 variant showed changes in mass that were consistent with N-terminal demethionylation and/or acetylation (S5 and S27 also appeared to be internally formylated and acetylated, respectively). S23 appeared to be internally hydroxylated or methylated. S2, S3, S9, S10, S12, S14, and S25 showed changes in mass inconsistent with known covalent modifications (+220, −75, +86, +56, −100, −117, and −103 Da, respectively), possibly representing novel post-translational modifications or allelic sequence variation. Five unidentified proteins (12,084, 13,706, 13,741, 13,884, and 34,987 Da) were observed; for one, a sequence tag (PPGPPP), absent in any known ribosomal proteins, was determined, suggesting that it is a previously undescribed ribosome-associated protein.

This study establishes a powerful method to rapidly analyze protein components of large biological complexes and their covalent modifications. Ribosomes are complex structures consisting of large numbers of proteins that interact with rRNA to form a functional protein-synthesizing entity. Much progress has been made in identifying the components of prokaryotic ribosomes and in understanding their structure and function in protein synthesis (reviewed in Refs. 1Wagner R. Arch. Microbiol. 1994; 161: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar and 2Hill W.E. Dahlberg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D. Warner J.R. The Ribosomes: Structure, Function, and Evolution. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990Google Scholar). However, less information is available for the more complex eukaryotic ribosomes. Previous studies have identified several covalent modifications of eukaryotic rRNA, demonstrating their importance in the enzymology and stability of ribosomes (reviewed in Refs. 2Hill W.E.

Less is known about the covalent modifications of eukaryotic ribosomal proteins, although protein and cDNA sequence information is now available for nearly all of the yeast, rat, and human ribosomal proteins (reviewed in Refs. 4Wool I.G.

Nevertheless, protein co- or post-translational modifications may have effects on the activity, stability, assembly, or localization of eukaryotic ribosomes. Mass spectrometry can be used to identify and characterize protein covalent modifications (reviewed in Refs. 7Burlingame A.L. Boyd R.K. Gaskell S.J. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 634R-683RCrossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and 8Biemann K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 977-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) without prior knowledge of their chemistry, providing an unbiased approach that is not achievable using techniques such as metabolic radiolabeling or chemical derivatization. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (9Fenn J.B. Mann M. Meng C.K. Wong S.F. Whitehouse C.M. Science. 1989; 246: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (6378) Google Scholar) is a particularly sensitive means of obtaining masses of proteins up to 100,000 Da with uncertainties of ∼0.01% from small amounts of sample (nano- to micrograms) (reviewed in Refs. 10Mann M.

When electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is coupled with reversed-phase HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyLC/MSreversed-phase HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometryMS/MStandem mass spectrometryCIDcollision-induced dissociationDa/edaltons/electron unit. (LC/MS), components within mixtures can be analyzed by mass as they elute from columns, allowing rapid analysis of proteins or peptides. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), in which peptide ions are fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (CID), provides amino acid sequence information, enabling identification of modified residues (12Biemann K. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 455-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). CID can be performed on all components in a sample by raising the orifice voltage (13Katta V. Chowdhury S.K. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1991; 63: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) or on a single ion selected in the first quadrupole, activated by argon in the second quadrupole, and analyzed in the third quadrupole (14Cooks R.G. Collision Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1978Crossref Google Scholar). Multisubunit complexes can also be analyzed by mass spectrometry, allowing identification of the protein components and their covalent modifications. Only two examples of this type of analysis have been reported previously, examining subunits of cytochrome bc1 (15Musatov A. Robinson N.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10561-10567Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and eukaryotic nucleosomes (16Weir M.S. Springer D.L. Thrall B.D. Fuciarelli A.F. Edmonds C.G. Techniques in Protein Chemistry.in: Crabb J.W. Vol. V. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1994: 115-122Google Scholar). In each case, protein components (<11) were first extracted and purified from these complexes prior to mass spectral analysis. In principle, the purification can be eliminated by the use of LC/MS analysis, saving time and avoiding loss by handling. Furthermore, the high sensitivity of the method enables analysis of limiting amounts of material, such as samples purified from cultured mammalian cells. high pressure liquid chromatography reversed-phase HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry tandem mass spectrometry collision-induced dissociation daltons/electron unit. In this study, we report new information about the protein composition of 40 S ribosomal subunits and the nature of co- or post-translational modifications of ribosomal proteins. Our study demonstrates a novel application of LC/MS and LC/MS/MS to rapidly identify the protein constituents and protein modifications of a large biological complex purified from cultured mammalian cells. Rat-1 fibroblasts were grown at 37°C in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 100 μg/ml each streptomycin and penicillin. Cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/dish in 30 150-cm2 culture dishes and allowed to grow to confluence for ribosome purification. 40 S ribosomes were purified by a procedure modified from Terao and Ogata (17Terao K. Ogata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All procedures were performed at 4°C unless otherwise stated. Cells were rinsed twice with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and twice with 5 ml of 0.25 M sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM benzamidine (Sigma), 20 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), 5 μg/ml pepstatin (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), 30 μM 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (Sigma), and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. Cells were drained, scraped, and then homogenized with a tight-fitting glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 350,000 × g for 100 min. Pellets were resuspended in 1.4 ml of 0.15 M sucrose, 10 mM MgCl2, 25 mM KCl, and 35 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, to which was added 0.4 ml of 2.5 M KCl and 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 ml of 10% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate. Approximately 0.5 ml of the suspension was layered onto 2.5 ml of 0.3 M sucrose, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.6 M KCl, and 35 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and centrifuged at 350,000 × g for 2 h. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 0.7-1.0 ml of 0.25 M sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM NaHCO3, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 10 min, yielding a supernatant enriched in 80 S ribosomes. 80 S ribosomes were dissociated into 40 S and 60 S subunits by addition of puromycin (Sigma) to 0.1 mg/ml and incubation for 10 min at 37°C, followed by addition of β-mercaptoethanol to 5 mM, KCl to 0.7 M, and MgCl2 to 1.25 mM and incubation for 15 min at 37°C. To purify ribosomal subunits, the dissociated ribosomes (0.5 ml) were layered onto 15-30% linear sucrose gradients (11.5 ml) containing 0.3 M KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and the gradients were centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 13 h in a Beckman SW 41 Ti rotor. Gradients were eluted at 0.5 ml/min in 0.5-ml fractions and analyzed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis visualized by silver staining (18Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3742) Google Scholar). Fractions containing 40 S subunits were pooled and diluted 2-fold with 0.6 M KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 1 mM dithiothreitol, and subunits were pelleted in 2-3-ml volume at 490,000 × g for 4 h. The final pellets were stored at −80°C until use. To dissociate 40 S ribosomal proteins from rRNA, each pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 6 M guanidine HCl, pH 5.0, followed by addition of 200 μl of 10% acetic acid and incubation on ice for at least 5 min. Precipitated rRNA was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 2 min at room temperature. Supernatants were used for direct LC/MS analyses as well as for partial protein purification and peptide generation for further mass spectral analyses. 40 S ribosomal proteins (rRNA-free) were partially resolved on either a Brownlee C4 microbore (Applied Biosystems, Inc., 2.1 mm × 3 cm) or a POROS R120 PEEK reversed-phase column (PerSeptive Systems; 2.1 mm × 3 cm). Columns were equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and proteins were eluted with a gradient in 0-80% acetonitrile and 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid at 1% acetonitrile/min and 200 μl/min. Protein elution was monitored at 215 nm by UV absorbance detection (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Model 785A; 2.4-μl flow cell), and fractions were collected manually. In some cases, post-column splitting was used to direct 10-15% of the HPLC effluent to the mass spectrometer and the rest to the UV absorbance detector for manual fraction collection. Acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid in the fractions was removed by lyophilization, and mass spectral analyses of either intact or proteolyzed proteins were performed after solubilization with 20 μl of 8 M urea and 80 μl of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8. Proteolysis was carried out with 5% (w/w) endoproteinase Lys-C (Wako Bioproducts) for 3-4 h at 37°C. Prior to mass spectral analysis, samples were acidified by addition of formic acid to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). Mass determinations of proteins or peptides were performed as described (19Resing K.A. Mansour S.J. Hermann A.S. Johnson R.S. Candia J.M. Fukasawa K. Woude G.F.V. Ahn N.G.

Protein components of 40 S subunits were separated on fused silica capillary columns (500 μm × 20 cm) packed with POROS R120 resin. Following column equilibration in 0.1% formic acid, proteins were loaded and eluted with a gradient in 0-80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid at 1% acetonitrile/min and 20 μl/min. Peptides generated after proteolysis were analyzed in a similar manner, except that Vydac C18 resin (Hewlett-Packard Co.) buffered with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid was used; peptides were eluted with a 0-40% acetonitrile gradient at 2% acetonitrile/min. Mass spectra for proteins were obtained by scanning from 350 to 1800 Da/e with 0.13-Da/e step size and 0.5-ms dwell time. The ionspray needle was held at a potential of 4.8 kV with a nebulizing air flow rate of 0.6 liter/min and an orifice voltage of 75-80 V. Conditions for peptide analysis were identical except that spectra were obtained by scanning from 50 to 1600 Da/e with 0.2-Da/e step size, and the ionspray needle was decreased to 4.5 kV; to obtain CID at the orifice, the orifice voltage was increased to 95 V. MS/MS was performed as proteins or peptides eluted from the capillary column into the mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS) (19Resing K.A. Mansour S.J. Hermann A.S. Johnson R.S. Candia J.M. Fukasawa K.

Individual ions were selected for CID in the first quadrupole and then accelerated to a kinetic energy of 16-18 eV and collisionally activated with argon at a thickness of 3.5-4.2 × 1014 atoms/cm3 in the high pressure collision cell of the second quadrupole. MS/MS data were collected in the third quadrupole by scanning from 50 to 1600 Da/e with 0.15-Da/e step size and 1.0-ms dwell time. Fragment ions produced were usually “b” and “y” types; in some cases, doubly charged fragment ions were observed (referred to as b2+ and y2+, corresponding to (b + 1H)2+ and (y + 1H)2+, respectively, in the nomenclature of Biemann (8Biemann K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 977-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar)). LC/MS and LC/MS/MS data were analyzed using software provided by Perkin-Elmer Sciex. Figures were prepared by importing data into Sigmaplot (Jandel Scientific), Photoshop (Adobe), or Canvas (Deneba). Ribosomes were purified from Rat-1 fibroblasts and separated into 60 S and 40 S subunits. 40 S ribosomal proteins were dissociated from 18 S rRNA and analyzed by LC/MS. Fig. 1 displays the mass/charge ratio (m/z) of the ribosomal proteins versus HPLC elution. Each protein is observed as a harmonic series of coeluting ions with varying m/z values. For example, in scans 328-330 (Fig. 1, arrow), a discrete series is observed that is clearly separated from neighboring series. Several scans were summed to produce an ion spectrum; for example, Fig. 2A illustrates an m/z series from MH99+ to MH2020+. Protein masses were then derived by deconvolution of the m/z series; for example, Fig. 2B shows the deconvolution of the data in Fig. 2A, indicating a mass of 14,709 Da. Even in situations where proteins coeluted (for example, scans 195-215), each protein produced a separate ion series that deconvoluted into distinguishable masses. Masses were accepted as valid ribosomal components if they were observed in each of three independent 40 S ribosomal protein preparations. All proteins selected by this criterion were observed with signal intensities >5-fold above background. Experimental errors were typically <0.01% of total protein mass, as measured by standard deviations of independent determinations represented by each set of m/z values as well as by standard deviations of mass determinations from three independent preparations of 40 S ribosomal proteins. Observed masses did not vary when ribosomes were prepared in the presence versus absence of protease inhibitors, indicating that proteolysis after cell disruption was not significant.Fig. 2Analysis of protein mass. A, an example of a mass spectrum was derived by summing several scans of LC/MS (scans 328-330 from Fig. 1). Peaks represent individual charged forms (m/z values indicated above) and correspond to MH99+ to MH2020+ (from right to left; the smallest peak that is not labeled is MH2020+ = 736.1 Da/e). Protein mass can be calculated from each peak using the formula (M + z)/z = observed mass of ion, where M is protein mass and z is charge. Protein masses in Table I are determined from these calculations. B, the deconvoluted mass spectrum of the m/z series in A indicates a major protein of 14,708.7 Da and two minor proteins of 14,740.8 and 14,766.0 Da; these minor peaks most likely represent an oxidation product of the major protein and a contaminating adduct (+57 Da) variably found in our experiments, respectively. The areas under these peaks are semiquantitative approximations of the relative amounts of each form.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LC/MS analyses of the 40 S ribosomal proteins yielded 41 protein masses. Other investigators have identified 33 rat 40 S ribosomal proteins, and amino acid and/or cDNA sequence information is available for 32 of these proteins (reviewed in Ref. 4Wool I.G. Chan Y.-L. Gluck A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 933-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Comparison of our observed masses with masses predicted from amino acid sequences showed that, within experimental error, 12 of the 41 proteins had observed masses identical to the predicted masses of S4, S6, S7, S8, S13, S15a, S16, S17, S19, S27a, S29, and S30 (Table I). Of these 12 proteins, two (S6 and S7) retained their initiator Met as indicated by amino acid sequencing (23Chan Y.-L. Wool I.G. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2071405292,"In search of synthetic high affinity ligands for the mannose receptor, we synthesized a series of lysine-based oligomannosides containing two (M2L) to six (M6L5) terminal α-D-mannose groups that are connected with the backbone by flexible elongated spacers (16 Å). The synthesized cluster mannosides were all able to displace binding of biotinylated ribonuclease B and tissue-type plasminogen activator to isolated human mannose receptor. The affinity of these cluster mannosides for the mannose receptor was continuously enhanced from 18-23 μM to 0.5-2.6 nM, with mannose valencies increasing from two to six. On average, expansion of the cluster mannoside with an additional α-D-mannose group resulted in a 10-fold increase in its affinity for the mannose receptor. M3L2 to M6L5 displayed negative cooperative inhibition of ligand binding to the mannose receptor, suggesting that binding of these mannosides involves multiple binding sites. The nanomolar affinity of the most potent ligand, the hexamannoside M6L5 makes it the most potent synthetic cluster mannoside for the mannose receptor yet developed. As a result of its high affinity and accessible synthesis, M6L5 not only is a powerful tool to study the mechanism of ligand binding by the mannose receptor, but it is also a promising targeting device to accomplish cell-specific delivery of genes and drugs to liver endothelial cells or macrophages in bone marrow, lungs, spleen, and atherosclerotic plaques.

CRD4 and CRD5 appear to be required for high affinity binding of high mannose-type glycoproteins and mannosylated bovine serum albumin (BSA). By contrast, at least five consecutive CRDs are needed for avid binding of highly mannosylated polysaccharides like mannan (14Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since each CRD embeds only a single mannose binding site, this implies that the mannose receptor may accommodate five to eight appropriately configured terminal α-D-mannose residues. Previous studies by Hoppe et al. (16Hoppe C.A. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14193-14199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Jansen et al. (17Jansen R.W. Molema G. Ching T.L. Oosting R. Harms G. Moolenaar F. Hardonk M.J. Meijer D.K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3343-3348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) established that the affinity of mannosylated albumin for the mannose receptor indeed correlated with the extent of mannosylation. Surprisingly, derivatization with more than 22-24 mannose groups was required for high affinity recognition by the mannose receptor. This is considerably higher than the maximum number of CRDs thought to participate in ligand binding. On one hand the above finding may reflect a purely entropic phenomenon, caused by an increased chance of α-D-mannose groups to be adequately configured with respect to each other. On the other hand, it may suggest that multiple receptor molecules cooperate in the ligand binding process. carbohydrate recognition domain tissue-type plasminogen activator biotinylated t-PA ribonuclease B biotinylated Ribo B bovine serum albumin Dulbecco“tblI”s modified Eagle“tblI”s medium. To address this we have evaluated the effect of mannose valency on the affinity for the mannose receptor in close detail using a series of homologous cluster mannosides that possess two to six terminal α-D-mannose groups. This study shows that recognition of low molecular weight mannosides by the mannose receptor is consistently, and not in a stepwise manner, enhanced with valencies increasing from two to six and thus provides new information on the process of ligand binding by the mannose receptor. Na125I in 0.1 M NaOH (13.5 mCi/μg) was purchased from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). BSA (fraction V, delipidated), collagenase (type I), p-nitrophenolphosphate, p-aminophenyl-α-D-mannopyranoside, and ribonuclease B (bovine pancreas) were purchased from Sigma.

Thiophosgene was obtained from Aldrich Chemie (Bornem, Belgium). N,N-Dimethylformamide obtained from Merck (Hohenbrunn, Germany) was refluxed for 4 h with CaH2 (5 g/liter) and distilled under reduced pressure. Streptavidin-alkaline-phosphatase conjugate was from Amersham. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) from a recombinant human melanoma cell culture was provided by Dr. J. Verheijen (Gaubius Laboratory, TNO-PG, Leiden, The Netherlands). Thin layer chromatography was performed using silica F254 preformed layers (0.1 mm) on a plastic backing (Schleicher & Schuell DC-F1500) and MeOH (A), acetonitrile-H2O (80:20, v/v) (B), or MeOH-CHCl3 (80:20, v/v) (C) as eluent. Carbohydrates were visualized after spraying with 20% H2SO4 in MeOH and subsequent heating at 140-160°C. Amine- or amide-containing compounds were visualized after spraying with ninhydrin and subsequent heating at 140°C, while compounds containing an aromatic group were visualized by UV shadowing (254 nm). Preparative column chromatography was performed using Kieselgel 60 (Merck, Hohenbrunn, Germany). NMR spectra were recorded at 300 MHz (1H) with a Bruker WM300 spectrometer operating in the Fourier transform mode. Chemical shifts are denoted in ppm (δ) relative to tetramethylsilane as internal standard. Mass spectra were obtained using a Finnigan MAT 900 mass spectrometer, using electrospray (MeOH/H2O (80/20) + 1% HAc) as the ionization technique. Positive ions were visualized after data processing using the HMR BSCAN UP profile. Compound 1a (Scheme 1) was converted into the phenyl isothiocyanate derivative (1b) as described by Monsigny et al. (18Monsigny M. Kieda C. Roche A. Biol. Cell. 1983; 47: 95-110Google Scholar) and Kataoka et al. (19Kataoka M. Tavassoli M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1984; 32: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In short, a mixture of compound 1a (244 mg, 0.9 mmol) and thiophosgene (0.52 ml, 5.1 mmol) in ethanol/H2O (80:20, v/v; 50 ml) was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The excess of thiophosgene was removed by perspiration with N2 for 1 h at room temperature. After concentration of the solution under reduced pressure, the residue was dissolved in a small volume of distilled water (1-2 ml), and NaOH (1.0 M) was added to pH 6.0. The solution was concentrated, and the residue was chromatographed over a Kieselgel 60 column (40 ml) using CH2Cl2/MeOH (80:20, v/v) as eluent. Fractions containing product 1b were pooled and lyophilized to yield 288 mg of a white crystalline powder (0.916 mmol; 102%); RF, 0.75 (B), 0.67 (C).

Mannosylated (oligo)lysines, i.e. M2L (2a), M3L2 (2b), M4L3 (2c), M5L4 (2d), and M6L5 (2e) were synthesized according to the procedure of Jansen et al. (17Jansen R.W. Molema G. Ching T.L. Oosting R.

In general, compound 1b (0.10 mmol; 32 mg) and (oligo)lysine (0.83 molar equivalents on the basis of the amino group content) were dissolved in a mixture of 0.1 M sodium hydrogen carbonate (pH 8.5) and N,N-dimethylformamide (50:50, v/v; 4 ml), and the solution was stirred for 18 h in the dark at room temperature. The progression of the reaction was monitored by TLC. In case all of compound 1b had reacted, while the reaction was not yet complete, an additional amount of 1b (0.4 molar equivalents) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for another 8 h. Subsequently, the mixture was concentrated in vacuo, and the crude products 2a-2e were chromatographed over a Kieselgel 60 column using acetonitrile/H2O (80:20, v/v) as eluent. Fractions containing products 2a-2e were pooled and lyophilized to yield a whitish powder.

Ribonuclease B or t-PA were dialyzed against 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.5, and subsequently incubated for 3 h at room temperature with N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated biotin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) at a ratio of 1 mol of protein to 6 mol of N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated biotin for ribonuclease B and 200 mol of N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated biotin for t-PA, respectively. After the reaction, the protein was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, and 0.5% (v/v) Tween 80. t-PA was radioiodinated by the IODO-GEN method as described, and a specific radioactivity of 3500-5000 cpm/ng of protein was obtained (20Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). Rat endothelial liver cells were isolated by a collagenase perfusion protocol at 37°C as described previously (21De Rijke Y.B. Jurgens G. Hessels E.M.A.J. Hermann A. Van Berkel T.J.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1315-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liver cells were separated by differential centrifugation, and endothelial cells were subsequently purified by counterflow centrifugation. The purity of endothelial cells as monitored by peroxidase staining was at least 95%. Viability of the cells used for in vitro experiments was judged by 0.2% trypan blue exclusion. Human mannose receptor was isolated from human placenta after solubilization with Triton X-100 and subsequent affinity chromatography over mannosylated albumin-Sepharose according to Otter et al. (22Otter M. Zockova P. Kuiper J. Van Berkel T.J.C. Barrett-Bergshoeff M.M. Rijken D.C. Hepatology. 1992; 16: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Displacement studies of binding of biotinylated ribonuclease B and biotinylated t-PA to isolated human mannose receptor were performed essentially as described by Otter et al. (9Otter M. Barrett-Bergshoeff M.M. Rijken D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13931-13935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activated PVC multiwell plates (Flow Laboratories) were coated overnight at 4°C with purified mannose receptor (±15 ng/well) in coating buffer (100 μl; pH 7.4), containing 20 mM Tris/HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2. After washing, the wells were incubated for 30 min at 20°C with assay buffer (coating buffer supplemented with 0.5% Tween 80 and 0.1% BSA) (125 μl) to minimize aspecific ligand binding. Then the wells were washed and preincubated for 30 min at 20°C with a solution of α-D-mannose (10 μM to 100 mM) or one of the cluster mannosides (1 nM to 2 mM) in assay buffer (100 μl). Biotinylated ribonuclease B or biotinylated t-PA in assay buffer was added to a final concentration of 580 and 1.3 nM, respectively, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 20°C. After a washing step, the wells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:1000 dilution in assay buffer; 100 μl). p-Nitrophenolphosphate (1 mg/ml; 100 μl in a 100 mM diethanolamine, 5 mM MgCl2 buffer, pH 9.5) was added after thorough rinsing of the wells. The plate was incubated for 4 h at 25°C, during which the ΔA405/h was determined as a measure of ligand binding. Uncoated wells were used as a control for aspecific adherence of biotinylated ribonuclease B or biotinylated t-PA to the wells. Competition studies of 125I-t-PA binding to endothelial liver cells were performed as described before (23Biessen E.A.L. Bakkeren H.F. Beuting D.M. Kuiper J. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells (2 × 106; 150 μg of cell protein), in Dulbecco“tblI”s modified Eagle“tblI”s medium (DMEM, 0.5 ml), containing 2% (w/v) BSA and 125I-t-PA (1 nM), were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with a variable concentration of unlabeled biotinylated t-PA (bio-t-PA), biotinylated Ribo B (bio-Ribo B), or M6L5 ranging from 0.1 nM to 20 μM. Following incubation, cells were washed twice with DMEM, 0.2% BSA and once with DMEM, and the cell-associated radioactivity was counted. Nonspecific binding was defined as 125I-t-PA binding in the presence of 100 mMα-D-mannose. Cell-bound radioactivity was determined using a Packard γ-counter and corrected for protein content. To calculate the IC50 values and Hill coefficients, the displacement binding data were analyzed according to the following binding model: percentage of specific binding = 100/(1 + ([displacer]/IC50nH) using a computerized nonlinear fitting program (Prism, ISI software; Ref. 24Biessen E.A.L. Norder J.A. Horn A.S. Robillard G.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 3959-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As a measure of the actual affinity for the mannose receptor, apparent inhibition constants (dissociation constants) were calculated from the IC50 values using the equation Ki(app) = IC50/(1 + [ligand]/Kd) and using Kd values for biotinylated ribonuclease B and t-PA obtained from the saturation binding studies (550 and 1.66 nm, respectively). The irregular competition curves of α-D-mannose were also fitted according to a two-site mixed stimulation/inhibition model (percentage of specific binding = (100 + percentage of maximal stimulation × (1 − 1/(1 + [displacer]/SC50)))/(1 + [displacer]/IC50), SC50 being the concentration at which half-maximal stimulation of ligand binding to the mannose receptor is attained. The significance of the differences between means was tested by unpaired two-way Student“tblI”s t test. The cluster mannosides were prepared by a two-step synthetic procedure. First, 4-aminophenyl-α-D-mannopyranoside (1a) was quantitatively converted into 4-(α-D-mannopyranosyloxy)phenylisothiocyanate using thiophosgene (1b). Second, the activated α-D-mannopyranoside 1b was reacted with a series of oligolysines, i.e. mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentalysine. Progression of the coupling was monitored on TLC by ninhydrin staining. The reaction was considered to be complete when no significant ninhydrin-positive spots, indicative of unreacted amino groups, could be detected. Subsequent chromatography of the crude reaction mixture over Kieselgel 60 and lyophilization afforded products 2a-2e as white crystalline powders at yields ranging from 34 to 83%. TLC analysis (UV, ninhydrin, sulfuric acid detection) confirmed that the isolated products 2a-2e were fully mannosylated, did not contain any free amino groups, and were apparently pure. 1H NMR and mass spectrometry of the isolated products 2a-2e were in agreement with the chemical structure of the anticipated products M2L, M3L2, M4L3, M5L4, and M6L5 (for chemical structures, see Fig. 1). First we have performed saturation studies of bio-Ribo B and bio-t-PA binding to the isolated mannose receptor in the enzyme-linked receptor sorbent assay described by Otter et al. (9Otter M. Barrett-Bergshoeff M.M. Rijken D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13931-13935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Barret-Bergshoeff et al. (25Otter M. Kuiper J. Bos R. Rijken D.C. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Bio-Ribo B and bio-t-PA binding appears to be saturable (0.354 ± 0.006 ΔA/h and 0.305 ± 0.003 ΔA/h, respectively) and obeyed classical law of mass action kinetics. The maximal binding capacity of bio-Ribo B and bio-t-PA were comparable. Analysis of the binding curves gave dissociation constants of 550 ± 70 nM for bio-Ribo B and 1.66 ± 0.05 nM for bio-t-PA. Hill coefficients were calculated to be close to unity (1.16 ± 0.43 and 1.13 ± 0.03, respectively), indicative of ligand binding to a single binding site. Subsequently, competition studies of bio-Ribo B binding were performed for the synthesized mannosides. As can be seen from Fig. 3A, all of the tested mannosides were able to completely inhibit the specific binding of bio-Ribo B to the isolated human mannose receptor. The potency of the compounds to inhibit bio-Ribo B binding was significantly increased with increasing mannose valency. The apparent inhibition constant Ki(app) of α-D-mannose was at least 106-fold higher than that of the hexamannoside M6L5, the most potent ligand in this study (2.7 mM and 2.6 nM, respectively, Table I). Even the dimannoside M2L possessed a considerably higher affinity (Ki(app) = 17.5 μM) than α-D-mannose.Fig. 3Competition studies of binding of biotinylated ribonuclease B (A) or biotinylated t-PA (B) to the isolated human mannose receptor by the following mannosides: α-D-mannose (∘); M2L (•); M3L2 (□); M4L3 (▪); M5L4 (▵), and M6L5 (▴). Multiwells, coated with isolated human mannose receptor, were incubated for 2 h at 20°C with a fixed concentration of biotinylated ribonuclease B (580 nM) or biotinylated t-PA (1.3 nM) in the absence or presence of displacer, at concentrations ranging from 10−10 to 10−1M. After incubation, ligand binding was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Total binding of bio-Ribo B and bio-t-PA is plotted as percentage of the control (without displacer) versus the log of the displacer concentration (in M). The inhibition curves for α-D-mannose, M2L, M3L2, M4L3, M5L4, and M6L5 were fitted using computerized nonlinear regression procedures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IAffinity of the cluster mannosides as determined from competition studies of binding of biotinylated ribonuclease B or t-PA to the isolated mannose receptorCompoundBio-Ribo BBio-t-PA−Log(IC50) (±S.D.)Ki (app)−Log(IC50) (±S.D.)Ki (app)∫nMnMα-D-Mannose2.00 (±0.04)2,700,0001.98 (±0.04)2,800,000M2L4.49 (±0.07)17,5004.38 (±0.07)22,600M3L25.76 (±0.10)9505.43 (±0.09)2020M4L36.61 (±0.15)1356.30 (±0.09)270M5L47.56 (±0.08)15.17.78 (±0.07)8.9M6L58.33 (±0.09)2.69.05 (±0.09)0.5 Open table in a new tab To verify that the cluster mannosides inhibited bio-Ribo B binding in a competitive fashion by blocking the mannose binding site on the mannose receptor rather than by directly interfering with bio-Ribo B itself, competition studies were also performed using another ligand for the human mannose receptor, bio-t-PA (22Otter M. Zockova P. Kuiper J. Van Berkel T.J.C. Barrett-Bergshoeff M.M. Rijken D.C. Hepatology. 1992; 16: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). In data not shown here, it was demonstrated that bio-t-PA binding to the mannose receptor was fully inhibited in a competitive fashion by ribonuclease B, indicating that both ligands interact with the same binding site on the mannose receptor. The bio-t-PA competition curves clearly demonstrated that the potency of the cluster mannosides to inhibit bio-t-PA binding was analogously increased with increasing mannose valency. Ki(app) values calculated from the bio-t-PA competition curves ranged from 2.8 mM for α-D-mannose to 8.9 nM for M5L4 and 0.5 nM for M6L5. This is illustrated in Fig. 4, in which −log(IC50) values of the mannosides from the bio-Ribo B assay are plotted against those from the bio-t-PA assay. Clearly, the affinities in both assays correlate excellently (correlation coefficient 0.984; p < 0.0001; slope 1.11 ± 0.07). Fig. 5 shows that there is only a minor tendency of the −log(IC50) values to level off at high mannose valencies, suggesting that the cluster mannosides did not yet reach the theoretical maximum affinity. Moreover, the increase in affinity is steady and intermediate plateau values for the cluster mannosides were not observed.Fig. 5Effect of the mannose valency on the potency of cluster mannosides to inhibit binding of biotinylated ribonuclease B (•) or t-PA (∘) to isolated human mannose receptor. Inhibitory potencies of the cluster mannosides are derived from the data in Table I and are expressed as −log(IC50) ± S.D. Invisible error bars indicate errors smaller than the symbol size.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To calibrate the receptor sorbent assay, competition studies of 125I-t-PA binding to endothelial liver cells were performed for M6L5, bio-t-PA, and bio-Ribo B. All three tested ligands were able to inhibit 125I-t-PA binding (Fig. 6) at inhibition constants that were congruent to those found in the receptor sorbent assay (Ki(app) = 1.7 ± 0.2, 3.4 ± 0.4, and 190 ± 70 nM, respectively). This further substantiates the validity of Ki(app) values derived from this receptor sorbent assay. Interestingly, displacement of bio-Ribo B and bio-t-PA binding to the human mannose receptor by the mannosides was not monophasic, as judged from the low Hill coefficients of M3L2, M4L3, M5L4, and M6L5 (nH = 0.4-0.5) (Fig. 7). In contrast, saturation curves of bio-Ribo B and bio-t-PA binding to isolated mannose receptor proceeded in a purely competitive fashion (nH = 1.16 ± 0.43 and 1.17 ± 0.02, respectively). In both assays, the bivalent mannoside M2L exhibited an intermediate Hill coefficient of 0.63 ± 0.05 (bio-Ribo B) and 0.85 ± 0.1 (bio-t-PA). The Hill coefficients of both ligand binding assays correlated significantly (r2 = 0.990, slope 1.006 ± 0.05; p < 0.0002). Competition curves of α-D-mannose were clearly irregular. α-D-Mannose appeared to stimulate ligand binding to the mannose receptor by ±25% at concentrations ranging from 30 to 300 μM. At higher concentrations, α-D-mannose inhibited binding in a positive cooperative fashion with Hill coefficients of 2.1 ± 0.5 (bio-Ribo B) and 2.2 ± 0.6 (bio-t-PA). Competition studies of 4-aminophenyl-α-D-mannopyranoside also gave a 33% stimulation combined with a positive cooperative inhibition (nH = 1.96 ± 0.143; data not shown). Since the stimulatory effect and the high apparent Hill coefficients were found in both receptor sorbent assays and in the endothelial cell binding assay (M6L5), we assume that it did not involve an artifact. Nonlinear regression analysis according to a two-site mixed stimulation/inhibition model showed that α-D-mannose induced a maximal stimulation of bio-Ribo B and bio-t-PA binding of 53 and 58%, respectively, at low concentrations. Half-maximal stimulation of ligand binding to the mannose receptor was attained at 250 μM (−log(SC50) = 3.6 ± 0.2) and 400 μM (−log(SC50) = 3.4 ± 0.2), respectively. Full inhibition of ligand binding was attained at a −log(IC50) of 2.00 ± 0.05 and 1.98 ± 0.04, respectively. The above mixed stimulation/inhibition model excel"
https://openalex.org/W1970810019,"Mucins function as a protective layer rendering the apical surface of epithelial cells nonadhesive to a variety of microorganisms and macromolecules. Muc-1 is a transmembrane mucin expressed at the apical cell surface of mouse uterine epithelial cells (UEC) that disappears as UEC become receptive for embryo implantation (Surveyor, G. A., Gendler, S. J., Pemberton, L., Das, S. K., Chakraborty, I., Julian, J., Pimental, R. A., Wegner, C. W., Dey, S. K., and Carson, D. D. (1995) Endocrinology 136, 3639-3647). In the present study, the kinetics of Muc-1 assembly, cell surface expression, release, and degradation were examined in polarized mouse UEC in vitro. Mucins were identified as the predominant glycoconjugates synthesized, apically expressed, and vectorially released in both wild-type and Muc-1 null mice. When mucins were released, greater than 95% were directed to the apical compartment. Approximately half of the cell-associated mucins lost during a 24-h period were found in the apical compartment. Vectorial biotinylation detected apically disposed, cell-surface mucin and indicated that at least 34% of these mucins are released apically within 24 h. This suggests that release of mucin ectodomains is part of the mechanism of mucin removal from the apical cell surface of UEC. The half-lives of total cell-associated mucins and Muc-1 were 19.5 ± 1 and 16.5 ± 0.8 h, respectively. Muc-1 represented approximately 10% of the [3H]glucosamine-labeled, cell-associated mucins. Studies of the kinetics of intracellular transport of Muc-1 indicated transit times of 21 ± 15 min from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus and 111 ± 28 min from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface. Collectively, these studies provide the first comprehensive description of Muc-1 and mucin maturation, metabolism, and release by polarized cells, as well as defining a major metabolic fate for mucins expressed by UEC. Normal metabolic processing appears to be sufficient to account for the removal of Muc-1 protein during the transition of UEC to a receptive state. Mucins function as a protective layer rendering the apical surface of epithelial cells nonadhesive to a variety of microorganisms and macromolecules. Muc-1 is a transmembrane mucin expressed at the apical cell surface of mouse uterine epithelial cells (UEC) that disappears as UEC become receptive for embryo implantation (Surveyor, G. A., Gendler, S. J., Pemberton, L., Das, S. K., Chakraborty, I., Julian, J., Pimental, R. A., Wegner, C. W., Dey, S. K., and Carson, D. D. (1995) Endocrinology 136, 3639-3647). In the present study, the kinetics of Muc-1 assembly, cell surface expression, release, and degradation were examined in polarized mouse UEC in vitro. Mucins were identified as the predominant glycoconjugates synthesized, apically expressed, and vectorially released in both wild-type and Muc-1 null mice.

Normal metabolic processing appears to be sufficient to account for the removal of Muc-1 protein during the transition of UEC to a receptive state. Mucins are a heterogenous class of large molecular weight glycoproteins (apparent Mr of 3 × 105-107) that function in vertebrates to protect epithelial cell surfaces from pathogens and digestive enzymes as well as to lubricate these surfaces (1Hilkens J.

Greater than 50% of mucin dry weight consists of oligosaccharides that are covalently linked to hydroxy amino acids through an α1,3 linkage to an N-acetylgalactosamine residue (5Devine P.L. McKenzie F.C. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Mucin oligosaccharide assembly is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus (6Roth J. Wang Y. Eckhart A.E.

The heterogeneity observed for a given protein core arises from the variable number of tandem repeats in a given gene (allelic polymorphism) as well as the variable size of the constituent oligosaccharides and degree of glycosylation (3Gendler S.J.

MUC1 is a transmembrane mucin expressed by a large number of simple secretory epithelial cells and aberrantly expressed in an underglycosylated form by cancer cells (3Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P.

Mucins, in general, and MUC1, in particular, are expressed in a polarized manner by normal epithelia. However, it is unclear whether these processes differ between normal and cancer cells or it is a function of cell polarity. MUC1 has been proposed to function as an anti-adhesive molecule in both cadherin- and integrin-mediated cell adhesion events in vitro (12Ligtenberg M.J.L. Buijs F. Vos H.L. Hilkens J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2318-2324PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wesseling J. van der Valk S.W. Vos H.L. Sonnenberg A. Hilkens J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). A correlation has been observed between the metastatic potential of primary tumors and the degree of glycosylation on MUC1 ectodomain (1Hilkens J. Ligtenberg J.L. Vos H.L. Litvinov S.V.

The mouse homolog, designated Muc-1, has a high degree of homology and amino acid identity to the human sequence in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains but not in the extracellular domain. Moreover, the mouse homolog does not display the allelic polymorphism that characterizes the human homolog (15Spicer A.P. Parry G. Patton S. Gendler S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15099-15109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Muc-1 null mice, the growth rates of primary breast tumors were significantly slower than in the wild-type strain, although there was no significant difference in the tumor metastasis (16Spicer A.P. Rowse G.J. Lidner T.K. Gendler S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30093-30101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Alternatively, MUC1 may facilitate metastasis by serving as a ligand for E- and P-selectin-mediated adhesion processes (17Baeckstrom D. Hansson G.C. Nilsson O. Johansson C. Gendler S.J. Lindholm L.

Enders A.C. Biol. Reprod. 1975; 12: 41-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The apical cell surface of UEC is only permissive for embryo attachment during a well defined but transient period termed the “window of receptivity” (23Psychoyos A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 476: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Studies from our lab have identified Muc-1 as one glycoconjugate expressed at the apical cell surface of UEC (24Surveyor G.A. Gendler S.J. Pemberton L. Das S.K. Chakraborty I. Julian J. Pimental R.A. Wegner C.W. Dey S.K. Carson D.D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3639-3647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this expression is markedly reduced during early pregnancy coinciding with the general reduction of the glycocalyx (24Surveyor G.A. Gendler S.J. Pemberton L. Das S.K. Chakraborty I.

Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 397-405PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Muc-1 functions as an anti-adhesive molecule during the peri-implantation period in mice by masking embryo attachment sites (24Surveyor G.A. Gendler S.J. Pemberton L.

Thus, the transition to a “receptive” uterine state is proposed to be, in part, contingent upon Muc-1 removal. Understanding the kinetics of Muc-1 maturation and removal is necessary to develop a detailed understanding of Muc-1 expression by UEC. In this study, we have utilized polarized mouse UEC cultured in vitro to estimate the rate of Muc-1 protein clearance as well as the kinetics of intracellular movement of Muc-1 to the apical cell surface. In addition, we demonstrate that mouse UEC express other mucins, that these other mucins are associated with the apical cell surface, and that their rate of protein clearance is similar to that of Muc-1. In general, apical release is a major metabolic fate of apically disposed, cell-associated mucins of UEC. uterine epithelial cells Bauhinia purpurea lectin (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]1propanesulfonate) Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline plus calcium and magnesium Dolichos biflorus lectin Datura stramonium (I) lectin Griffonia simplicifolia (I) lectin Hanks' buffered saline solution Helix pomatia lectin Maclura pomifera lectin peptide:N-glycosidase A; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protease inhibitor mixture solution Arachis hypogaea lectin Streptomyces griseus protease Phytolacca americana lectin Ricinus communis (I) lectin sample extraction buffer Solanum tuberosum lectin wheat germ agglutinin from Triticum vulgaris.

All other lectins and lectin agaroses were purchased from E-Y Labs (San Mateo, CA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. All chemicals used were reagent grade or better. Primary cultures of polarized uterine epithelial cells (UEC) were prepared from excised uteri of randomly cycling CF-1 mice as described previously, using Matrigel-coated Anocell 10 culture inserts and culture in serum-free medium (26Jacobs A.L. Decker G.L. Glasser S.R. Julian J. Carson D.D. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Routine staining of such cultures for the epithelial marker proteins, cytokeratins and uvomorulin, demonstrated that they consisted of >95% epithelial cells. UEC cultures were established for 18 h prior to metabolic labeling with [3H]glucosamine (50 μCi/ml) in serum-free medium. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that labeling of the cell-associated material reached equilibrium by 8-10 h. At the end of the labeling time, cells were rinsed several times with medium prewarmed to 37°C without label, and the medium as well as cell-associated glycoconjugate fractions were processed for glycoconjugate analysis. The residual material, left after extraction with Nonidet P-40, was extracted with sample extraction buffer (SEB) (0.05 M Tris, pH 7.0, 8 M urea, 1.0% (w/v) SDS, 0.01% (w/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.0% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol). Apically released, 3H-labeled glycoconjugates were collected and centrifuged (100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C) to remove cellular debris and desalted on a Sephadex G-50 column (6 × 300 mm) equilibrated in D-PBS. The material eluting in the void volume was retained for further analysis. The material eluting in the included volume was discarded. UEC were cultured for 2 days as described above. Labeling was begun by adding medium prewarmed to 37°C containing [3H]glucosamine (50 μCi/ml). In certain experiments, the labeling medium was supplemented with cycloheximide (1 μg/ml). Cycloheximide was added 2 h after initiation of the labeling period, and the incubation was continued for the indicated time prior to harvest. Parallel control cultures were incubated for the same period in medium lacking cycloheximide. In other experiments, UEC were collected after labeling with [3H]glucosamine (50 μCi/ml) for the indicated time and processed for cell surface biotinylation. UEC were cultured for 18 h as described above. The cultured cells were rinsed several times with serum-free medium prewarmed to 37°C, and the cells were metabolically labeled for 20 h with [3H]glucosamine (50 μCi/ml) in serum-free medium. After being rinsed several times with serum-free unlabeled medium, the cells were incubated in this prewarmed medium for time intervals up to 24 h. The medium constituting the apically released fraction was collected at selected intervals and processed as described below for mucin analysis. The filters were placed in 100 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) containing 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide at 4°C for 10 min. Excess D-PBS was removed from the filter, and 100 μl of 98°C extraction buffer (0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, in D-PBS at pH 7.0) was added to the apical side of the UEC. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature the extraction buffer was removed and 100 μl of room temperature extraction buffer was applied and removed immediately. Sodium azide and protease inhibitor mixture (PIMS) were added to the pooled cell-associated Nonidet P-40 extract to give a final concentration of 0.02% (w/v) and 1:100 (v/v), respectively. PIMS was composed of 10 mg/ml benzamidine, 2 mg/ml antipain, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml chymostatin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, and 7.6 trypsin-inhibiting units/ml aprotinin in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, and 0.9% (v/v) benzyl alcohol. The extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 40 min at 4°C and used for further analyses. Primary cultures of UEC were cultured, labeled, washed, and extracted as described above. After preclearing by centrifugation, the extracts were incubated by constant rotary agitation overnight (16-18 h) at 4°C with polyclonal antibody CT-1 at a 1:25 ratio of serum to extract. The rabbit antibody is directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the terminal 17 amino acids of the C terminus of Muc-1 and has been described previously (24Surveyor G.A. Gendler S.J. Pemberton L. Das S.K. Chakraborty I. Julian J. Pimental R.A. Wegner C.W. Dey S.K. Carson D.D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3639-3647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antigen-antibody complex was incubated for 4 h at room temperature with constant rotary agitation after the addition of 64 μl of approximately a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose. The pelleted resin was washed twice at room temperature by resuspension and centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 3 min with 1 ml of extraction buffer and twice with 1 ml of D-PBS to remove non-resin-bound material. The immunoprecipitated Muc-1 was solubilized from the resin with addition of 50 μl of SEB. Greater than 90% of the total radioactivity, including Muc-1, was extracted under these conditions. Portions of the extract were either analyzed by liquid scintillation counting or 7.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (27Porzio M.A. Pearson A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) with a 3.5% (w/v) Laemmli stacking gel (28Lamelli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Nonimmune serum was generated by preincubating immune sera on ice with 100 μg/ml of the CT-1 peptide for 30 min and pelleting at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to remove particulate debris. This nonimmune (peptide-blocked) serum was subsequently used to precipitate nonspecific antigen-antibody complexes from Nonidet P-40 extracts as described for CT-1. Lectin binding was monitored by incubating 3H-labeled cell-associated glycoconjugates, in 0.5 ml of 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 in D-PBS and containing 50 μl of lectin-agarose (approximately a 50% suspension) in the absence or presence of 0.75 M monosaccharide competitor. Cell debris in the apical media was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. Approximately 5,000-10,000 dpm of 3H-labeled Nonidet P-40-extractable, cell-associated apically released glycoconjugates or 3,000-5,000 dpm of 3H-labeled Muc-1 was used for these assays except where otherwise indicated. These suspensions were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with constant rotary agitation. The unbound material was removed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g followed by four washes with 1.0 ml of binding buffer. The radioactivity associated with the resin was determined by resuspending the pellet in D-PBS and transferring it to scintillation vials for counting. Specificity of binding to the lectin gel for the labeled glycoconjugates was determined by subtracting the radioactivity associated with binding to the resin in the presence of competitor from the radioactivity associated with binding to the resin in the absence of competitor. Apical media were fractionated by binding to WGA agarose as described above. The unbound fraction was used for further processing as described below. The WGA-bound glycoconjugates were eluted by incubating the resin in 0.5 M N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in D-PBS containing PICS (1:100) and 2 mM EDTA at 25°C for 4 h. After pelleting the resin, the WGA-bound extract was saved and processed as described below. Recoveries from fractionation of the apical media were 85-90%. Cells were washed several times with D-PBS, precooled for 10 min in D-PBS at 4°C containing 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide, then extracted with Nonidet P-40 according to the immunoprecipitation protocol. The residual unextracted cell fraction was solubilized in 8 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 20 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 2 mM EDTA, and PIMS (1:100). The pooled Nonidet P-40 extract was processed for immunoprecipitation. The nonimmunoprecipitable Nonidet P-40 extract was collected and processed as described below. The immunoprecipitated Muc-1 was eluted from the protein A by two sequential incubations for 3 h at 25°C using 8 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 20 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 0.025% (w/v) sodium azide, and 2 mM EDTA. This extract was dialyzed and dried under rotary vacuum with the other samples. Both fractions were analyzed by Superose 12 chromatography as described. The residual extract was pooled and supplemented with 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide and PICS (1:100). The nonimmunoprecipitable Nonidet P-40 extract, the residual extract, and the media fractions were dialyzed (Mr cut-off 1,000) at 4°C against 0.1 × D-PBS containing 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, 1 mM EDTA, 1:1,000 PIMS, and 1 mM glucosamine with four changes of dialysis buffer. The retentates were divided into three equal portions and dried under a rotary vacuum. One-third of the dried extract was stored at −20°C for 48 h and was considered intact. One-third was subjected to exhaustive Pronase digestion by incubating heat-denatured (95°C for 2 min) samples at 50°C for 24 h with 1.5 mg/ml predigested Pronase in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM CaCl2, and 5% (v/v) ethanol buffer. The incubation was continued for an additional 24 h with a freshly prepared addition of predigested Pronase. Predigested Pronase was made by incubating for 30 min at 50°C 10 mg/ml Pronase in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM CaCl2, and 5% (v/v) ethanol buffer. Pronase-digested samples were concentrated as described above. The final third of the glycoconjugate fractions was subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis (β-elimination) by incubating the glycoconjugates in 0.1 M NaOH, 0.25 M NaBH4 at 37°C for 48 h (29Planter J.J. Carlson D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 46-48Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Samples were neutralized with acetic acid and dried under rotary vacuum prior to analysis. Macromolecules were fractionated under dissociative conditions by molecular exclusion liquid chromatography as described previously (30Tang J.-P. Julian J. Glasser S.R. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12832-12842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recoveries from this procedure ranged between 85 and 95%. Polarized UEC were collected at the indicated time of incubation with [3H]glucosamine and processed for vectorial biotinylation (31Bayer E.A. Ben-Hur H. Wilchek M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 281-371Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After aseptically washing the cells three times with 4°C D-PBS supplemented with 2 mM CaCl2 and 2 mM MgCl2 (D-PBS-CM), the cells were incubated at 4°C for 30 min in the dark with 500 μl of D-PBS-CM supplemented with 20 mM sodium metaperiodate on the apical surface only and with 500 μl of D-PBS-CM on the basal filter surface. Periodate oxidation was terminated by removing the periodate-containing PBS and gentle agitation under subdued lighting for 5 min at 4°C in 50-200 ml of D-PBS-CM containing 200 mM sucrose. Filters were washed twice with 4°C Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide. The cells were incubated for 2.5 h at 4°C under subdued lighting with 500 μl of HBSS containing 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide, apically and basally. Aldehydes formed by periodate oxidation were reacted with 100 μg/ml biotin hydrazide in HBSS in the apical compartment. The reaction was terminated by washing with HBSS and Muc-1 was immunoprecipitated as described above. Apically disposed and nonimmunoprecipitable cell-associated glycoconjugates were isolated as described above. Biotinylated components in each fraction were selected by incubation with 65 μl of streptavidin-agarose (approximately a 50% suspension) for 4 h at room temperature. The streptavidin-agarose was washed four times with 1 ml of binding buffer. The radioactivity associated with the resin was determined by resuspending the pellet in 400 μl of binding buffer and transferring it to scintillation vials for counting. Total cell-associated Muc-1 was determined by immunoprecipitation as described above. Radioactivity associated with apically disposed Muc-1 was defined as that portion of the immunoprecipitable 3H-Muc-1 that bound to streptavidin-agarose. Cell viability at the end of the incubation with periodate and biotinylation exceeded 90% as indexed by morphology and trypan blue dye exclusion. Cells remained viable by these criteria for at least 24 h following these treatments. - Protein concentrations were determined by the procedure of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. UEC were metabolically labeled with [3H]glucosamine to selectively label glycoconjugates. As shown in Fig. 1, the extraction procedure used efficiently solubilized Muc-1 from polarized UEC. Antibody to Muc-1 specifically immunoprecipitated a [3H]glucosamine-labeled component of the expected Mr, i.e. greater than 200,000, from UEC extracts of wild-type mice (lane 12) but not Muc-1 null mice (lane 5), which was absent in samples immunoprecipitated with the peptide-preabsorbed anti-Muc-1 antibody (lanes 3 and 10). Furthermore, little 3H-labeled material with Mr corresponding to Muc-1 was detected in the residual cell-associated material remaining on the filter after extraction with Nonidet P-40 (lanes 2 and 9). Only background levels of radioactivity were detected when a second immunoprecipitation of the Nonidet P-40 extract was performed (lanes 6 and 13) demonstrating that a single immunoprecipitation step was sufficient to recover greater than 90% of Muc-1. Other prominent 3H-labeled bands were detected in the total protein extract. These components also were present in total protein extracts of UEC from Muc-1 null mice indicating that these components are not precursors to or metabolically derived from Muc-1. As shown below, mucins are the predominant 3H-labeled, non-Muc-1 glycoconjugates in either wild-type or Muc-1 null UEC. It was concluded that the immunoprecipitation for Muc-1 was specific and efficient. As shown in Table I, the lectin-binding characteristics of immunoprecipitated, cell-associated Muc-1 were similar to those of the other glycoconjugate fractions. Binding to WGA was the highest, followed by BPA, RCA-1, and Ulex europaeus (I) lect"

These observations constitute a novel mode of Grb2 association and suggest a model in which association with a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein restricts the repertoire of SH3 binding proteins with which Grb2 can simultaneously interact. The function of the Tyr798 tyrosine phosphorylation/Grb2 binding site in RPTPα was studied further by expression of wild type or mutant RPTPα proteins in PC12 cells. In these cells, wild type RPTPα interferes with acidic fibroblast growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth; this effect requires both the catalytic activity and the Grb2 binding Tyr798 residue in RPTPα. In contrast, expression of catalytically active RPTPα containing a mutated tyrosine phosphorylation/Grb2 association site enhances neurite outgrowth.

Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in proteins constitutes a widespread regulatory modification, often serving to propagate intracellular signals involved in the generation of a specific cellular response to an extracellular stimulus (3Van der Geer P.

Controlled activation of this regulatory mechanism relies on the coordinated contribution of five classes of proteins: tyrosine kinases, their direct substrates, adaptor proteins, signaling molecules, and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). 1The abbreviations used are: PTPaseprotein-tyrosine phosphataseaFGFacidic fibroblast growth factorGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutininR-PTPasereceptor protein-tyrosine phosphataseSHSrc homologyEGFepidermal growth factorHERhuman EGF receptorWTwild type. Tyrosine phosphorylation can directly control the catalytic activity of a tyrosine kinase, such as the insulin receptor, or of a phosphorylated enzyme substrate, such as phospholipase C-γ. More often, however, the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues acts as a reversible switching mechanism governing the assembly of particular protein-protein complexes. Individual tyrosine autophosphorylation sites on activated receptor tyrosine kinases interact directly or indirectly with particular signaling molecules, and mutation of particular sites restricts the repertoire of signaling pathways being activated. It has been extensively documented that SH2 domains associate with phosphotyrosine in a context-specific manner (6Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F.

Other protein-protein associations dependent on the presence of phosphotyrosine can be mediated by the phosphotyrosine interaction/phosphotyrosine binding domain (7Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N.

As a consequence of such protein-protein associations, changes may occur in the catalytic activity or intracellular localization of proteins that are not necessarily phosphorylated themselves (see Refs. 3Van der Geer P.

Yet, the high number of Grb2 binding proteins raises a number of questions. First, what is the function of Grb2 association with such a diverse repertoire of proteins, including kinases, phosphatases, structural proteins, and others? More particularly, does the Grb2 protein, in all settings where its SH2 domain interacts with a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, act as an adaptor for Sos recruitment, or can the nature of the SH2 domain bound ligand determine the repertoire of proteins that can simultaneously interact with the SH3 domains of Grb2? Last, to what extent can the various Grb2 binding proteins compete for a shared pool of intracellular Grb2 protein? Studies on the function of the hemopoietic CD45 antigen and its identification as a trans-membrane (“receptor”) tyrosine phosphatase (R-PTPase), have drawn increased attention to the role of PTPases in signaling events. CD45 PTPase activity is required for signaling through the T-cell receptor; more particularly, in the absence of CD45 expression, ligation of the T-cell receptor fails to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, suggesting that CD45 acts upstream of a tyrosine kinase. Evidence that CD45 controls the phosphorylation state of the negative regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the kinases Lck and Fyn (residues analogous to Tyr527 in c-Src) suggests that CD45 acts as a necessary positive regulator of these Src family kinases (5Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar, 35Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In contrast to CD45, RPTPα is a widely expressed member of the R-PTPase family. This R-PTPase consists of a relatively small (130 residues) and highly glycosylated extracellular domain, linked to an intracellular domain containing two PTPase homology domains (36Sap J.

Overexpression of RPTPα can enhance the kinase activity of endogenous c-Src, concomitant with decreased c-Src phosphorylation levels at the Tyr527 residue, suggesting that endogenous RPTPα may also contribute to the regulation of the phosphorylation level at Tyr527 in c-Src, and thus the c-Src kinase activity (41den Hertog J.

Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In several cell types, endogenous RPTPα is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine. Interestingly, phosphorylation of RPTPα is required for association of RPTPα with the adaptor protein Grb2, with which RPTPα is found associated in vivo (1Su J. Batzer A. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18731-18734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Such tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPases and ensuing recruitment of signaling proteins is not an isolated observation. Analogous observations have been made for CD45 as well as for the SH2 domain containing PTPase Syp (e.g. Refs. 12Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J.H. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J.

First, we have investigated whether the Grb2 protein, when associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated RPTPα, performs a similar adaptor function (i.e. Sos recruitment) as in the case of its association with tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor or Shc. Second, using a strategy which has been highly successful in dissecting the signaling pathways controlled by activated tyrosine kinases, we have investigated the consequences of mutation of the phosphorylated and Grb2-binding tyrosine residue for RPTPα function in vivo.

The conditioned medium was collected after 24-h periods; virus titers, assayed by generation of histidinol-resistant colonies in 3T3 cells, were approximately 104 to 105 colony-forming units/ml. Stable clones were generated by infection with an appropriately low virus titer for 3 h in the presence of polybrene, followed by selection for histidinol (Sigma) (4 mM) resistance starting 2 days after infection. Pools of clones were generated by infection of 2 × 105 cells with 1 ml (104 to 105 colony-forming units/ml) of virus, followed by selection. 105 PC12 cells were seeded per 3.5-cm plate and grown in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 10% fetal calf serum) overnight. The cells were then transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum and 0.5% horse serum supplemented with 50 ng/ml acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) (a gift from Dr. I. Lax) and 50 μg/ml heparin. The RPTPα protein associates with Grb2 in vitro and in vivo. This interaction requires both tyrosine phosphorylation of RPTPα, which occurs at residue Tyr789 in mouse RPTPα (numbering of Ref. 36Sap J. D'Eustacchio P. Givol D. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6112-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), corresponding to Tyr798 of human RPTPα (numbering of Ref. 38Kaplan R. Morse B. Huebner K. Croce C. Howk R. Ravera M.

In preliminary studies, we observed that, by itself, an isolated Grb2 SH2 domain only weakly associates with phosphorylated RPTPα. Similarly, we were unable to detect binding of a recombinant Grb2 SH2 domain protein with phosphorylated RPTPα by “far Western” analysis (data not shown). We therefore investigated in more detail the Grb2 domain requirements for the association of this adaptor protein with tyrosine-phosphorylated RPTPα. To this purpose, we used a set of recombinant WT and mutant Grb2 proteins, which were generated as GST fusion proteins, immobilized on glutathione agarose beads and used as affinity matrices. The mutant proteins used were Grb2-FLVR, containing a point mutation (R86K), which disables interaction of the SH2 domain with phosphotyrosine (10Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W.

Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar); and Grb2-ΔN and Grb2-ΔC, deletion mutants of the N- and C-terminal SH3 domains, respectively (46Zhou M. Signaling by Receptor Tyrosine Kinases: Ligand-binding and Interaction with SH2 Domain-containing Proteins.Ph.D. thesis. New York University, 1995Google Scholar). The immobilized proteins were incubated in the presence of detergent lysates prepared from RPTPα-expressing 293T cells, and binding of RPTPα protein was monitored by anti-RPTPα immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). Strikingly, deletion or point mutation of the C-terminal, but not the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2, almost completely abolished the ability of Grb2 to associate with RPTPα. To establish the validity of these observations, we performed control experiments with two other proteins that interact with Grb2 in a better understood manner. First, we investigated the affinity of the HER for the same set of Grb2 proteins. Her14 cells (a 3T3 derivative) were stimulated with EGF for 5 min, and Triton lysates were incubated with the same Grb2 proteins used for the experiment in Fig. 1A. Consistent with previously reported data (10Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar, 14Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Ureña J.M. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it can be seen in Fig. 1B that tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor binds equally efficiently to WT Grb2 protein as to Grb2 proteins in which the N- or C-terminal SH3 domains have been mutated or deleted. This proves that the Grb2-ΔC and Grb2-G203R proteins display an intact SH2 domain function. We also monitored in vitro binding of the Sos protein to our battery of recombinant Grb2 proteins. This control experiment (Fig. 1C) showed that association of Sos with Grb2 involved a function for both the N- and C-terminal SH3 domains of Grb2, as reported previously (11Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). However, Sos binding was more sensitive to deletion of an entire SH3 domain than to the effect of point mutations P49L and G203R, suggesting again that the effect of the G203R mutation is unlikely to be due to gross misfolding of the Grb2 protein. To extend these observations to the in vivo situation, we performed two types of transient coexpression experiments. First, we used an indirect assay to gauge RPTPα-Grb2 association. Association with a matching SH2 domain protects tyrosine phosphorylation sites in proteins from phosphatase action; this effect has been used successfully to map binding sites for individual SH2 domains (14Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Ureña J.M. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Rotin D. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Daly R.J. Daum G. Li N. Fischer E.H. Burgess W.H. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In the case of a tyrosine-phosphorylated tyrosine phosphatase, this protective effect may extend to both autodephosphorylation and dephosphorylation by other endogenous PTPases. We previously demonstrated that transient coexpression of Grb2, but not other SH2 domain-containing proteins, results in increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of RPTPα in vivo and that this effect is dependent on an intact Grb2 SH2 domain (although both the 110- and 130-kDa forms of RPTPα undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and associate with Grb2 in vitro and in vivo, RPTPα hyperphosphorylation induced by Grb2 overexpression is limited to the 130-kDa form of RPTPα (1Su J. Batzer A. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18731-18734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); since the 110-kDa form is a precursor of the 130-kDa form (40Daum G. Regenass S. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10524-10528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it may be differentially localized in the cell and thus less accessible to Grb2 or more susceptible to in vivo dephosphorylation). We extend this approach here to Grb2 proteins lacking the N- or C-terminal SH3 domain. A"

The substrate inhibition was not competitive with MgATP and could be attributed to formation of the abortive complex guanylate kinase·MgADP·GMP. The equilibrium constant of the reaction was measured under various conditions by NMR and a radiometric assay. The results showed that the steady-state kinetic parameters were consistent with the thermodynamic constant. NMR titration and equilibrium dialysis showed that both substrates and products could bind to free guanylate kinase.

Neurosci. 1985; 8: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on their affinity for different drugs, two different benzodiazepine binding sites have been identified in the central nervous system. Type I (benzodiazepine receptor 1, ω1) displays high affinity for CL 218,872 (2Tallman J.F. Gallager D.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1985; 8: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), β-carboline derivates (3Nielsen M. Braestrup C. Nature. 1980; 286: 606-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and the imidazopyridine zolpidem (4Arbilla S. Allen J. Wick A. Langer S.Z. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 130: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5Langer S.Z. Arbilla S. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1988; 29: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Type II (benzodiazepine receptor 2, ω2) displays low affinity for these compounds. A third benzodiazepine binding site with very low affinity for zolpidem (type IIL, ω5) has also been identified in isolated rat brain membranes (6Ruano D. Vizuete M. Cano J. Machado A. Vitorica J. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and sections (7Benavides J. Peny B. Ruano D. Vitorica J. Scatton B. Brain Res. 1993; 604: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Molecular cloning experiments have demonstrated the existence of five different families of subunits that are components of the GABAA receptor complex. Most of these families comprise several isoforms: α1-α6, β1-β3, γ1-γ3, δ, and ρ1 and ρ2 (for reviews, see 8Olsen R.W. Tobin A.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1469-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar and 9Burt D.R. Kamatchi G.L. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2916-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). A minimum of α, β, and γ subunits should be co-expressed in transfected cells to resemble all the pharmacological properties of native GABAA receptors (10Pritchett D.B. Sontheimer H. Shivers B.D. Ymer S. Kettenmann H. Schofield P.R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1989; 338: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the presence of different α subunits determines the affinity of the different benzodiazepine binding sites. In this sense, the α1-β1-β3-γ2 combination confers type I pharmacology to the recombinant GABAA receptor (i.e. high affinity for, among others, zolpidem and Cl 218,872) (11Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1802-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Type II properties are conferred by the presence of α2, α3, or α5 subunits (11Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1802-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 12Pritchett D.B. Luddens H. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 1389-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar).Several approaches have been taken to identify which subunits co-exist in the native GABAA receptor complex. However, the subunit composition of the different native GABAA receptor complexes remains unsolved. Immunoprecipitations or immunoaffinity purifications using anti-α subunit antibodies (anti-α1, -α2, -α3, -α5, and -α6 subunits) indicated that a significant proportion of native receptors are made by the association of two different α subunits (such as α1α2, α1α3, α1α5, or α1α6) (13Duggan M.J.

Neurochem. 1996; 66: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in a single receptor complex. However, other authors have indicated the absence of association between different α subunits (18McKernan R.M. Quirk K. Prince R. Cox P.A. Gillard N.P. Ragan C.I. Whiting P. Neuron. 1991; 7: 667-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 19Quirk K. Gillard N.P. Ragan C.I. Whiting P.J. McKernan R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16020-16028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the pharmacological properties of these GABAA receptors are also unknown.In the present article we have addressed these questions by determining the molecular and pharmacological properties of the immunopurified receptors using subunit-specific antibodies to the major α subunits expressed in the rat cerebral cortex, the α1 and α3 subunits.DISCUSSIONThe molecular composition of native GABAA receptors is unknown. Evidence is accumulating for the existence of different α subunit combinations (such as α1α3, α1α2, α1α5, and α1α6) co-assembled in single native GABAA receptor complexes. However, other studies also indicated the absence of co-existence between different α subtypes (18McKernan R.M. Quirk K. Prince R. Cox P.A. Gillard N.P. Ragan C.I. Whiting P. Neuron. 1991; 7: 667-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 19Quirk K. Gillard N.P. Ragan C.I. Whiting P.J. McKernan R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16020-16028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is currently accepted that the benzodiazepine binding properties of the GABAA receptors are mainly determined by the α subunits (10Pritchett D.B. Sontheimer H. Shivers B.D. Ymer S. Kettenmann H. Schofield P.R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1989; 338: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 11Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. J.

Therefore, if two different α subunit subtypes are co-assembled in a single GABAA receptor, two pharmacologically different benzodiazepine binding sites could co-exist in a single complex. In the present article we have investigated the possible existence and the pharmacological properties of native α1-α3 GABAA receptors from the rat cortex.The presence of α1 and α3 subunits in the same GABAA receptor complex was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and immunopurification experiments. It has been described that, in transfected GABAA receptors, the high affinity binding sites for zolpidem (type I benzodiazepine binding sites) are determined by the presence of α1 subunits. Other α subtypes (such as α2, α3, and α5) confer low affinity for this ligand (type II benzodiazepine receptors) (11Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1802-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 12Pritchett D.B. Luddens H. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 1389-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Therefore, the association of an α1 with other α subunits could be estimated by immunoprecipitation of the [3H]zolpidem binding activity. Our immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2A and 21Ruano D. Araujo F. Machado A. De Blas A.L. Vitorica J. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 25: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and 22Ruano D. Khan Z.U. De Blas A.L. Machado A. Vitorica J. Eur. J. Pharmacol Mol. Pharmacol. Sect. 1994; 267: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) demonstrate that most, if not all (90.0 ± 5.4%), of the high affinity binding sites for zolpidem are due to the presence of an α1 subunit in the GABAA receptor. Importantly, 25-30% of these [3H]zolpidem binding sites were immunoprecipitated by anti-α3 antibody, thus suggesting an α1-α3 association. Consistently, immunodepletion of the α1 subunits suppress the immunoprecipitation of [3H]zolpidem binding by the anti-α3 antibody (Table II). Thus, α1 binding properties could be immunoprecipitated in association with α3 subunits, suggesting the presence of both α1 and α3 subunits in the same receptor complex.The association between both subunits was confirmed by immunopurification experiments. The immunoblot analysis of the anti-α1- or anti-α3-immunopurified receptors (Fig. 2B) revealed the presence of α3 immunoreaction product in the anti-α1-immunopurified receptors and, reciprocally, the presence of α1 in anti-α3-immunopurified receptors. Furthermore, the association between both α subunits was not due to interactions with cytoskeletal elements. Taken together, these results demonstrated the existence of α1-α3 GABAA receptors from the rat cortex. Immunodepletion experiments indicated that the α1-α3 GABAA receptors constituted a relatively minor proportion of the total α1-containing GABAA receptors (20-25% of this population) but 50-55% of the α3 containing GABAA receptors. Thus, and in partial agreement with previous reports (13Duggan M.J. Pollard S. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24778-24784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pollard S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5965-5973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the association between two different α subunits represents a minor population from the total α1-containing receptors but a high proportion of other α subunits, such as α3.The presence of different α subtypes, in combination with β1-β3 and γ2 subunits, determines the benzodiazepine binding properties of recombinant GABAA receptors (10Pritchett D.B. Sontheimer H. Shivers B.D. Ymer S. Kettenmann H. Schofield P.R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1989; 338: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 11Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. J.

As mentioned above, the α1 subunit confers type I benzodiazepine binding properties (high affinity for zolpidem and Cl 218,872), whereas the α3 subunit confers type II binding properties (low affinity for these ligands). Therefore, if two different α subunits, such as α1 and α3, are co-assembled in the same receptor complex, and both α1 and α3 subunits are pharmacologically active, two different benzodiazepine binding subtypes should be discriminated in either anti-α1- and anti-α3-immunopurified receptors. As shown in Table III, in anti-α1- and anti-α3-immunopurified receptors, two different binding sites were identified. The affinities for zolpidem (determined by Scatchard and displacement experiments) or Cl 218,872 (determined by displacement experiments) were similar in both immunopurified receptors and similar to those reported for type I and II benzodiazepine binding sites in cortical membranes (6Ruano D. Vizuete M. Cano J. Machado A. Vitorica J. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Benavides J. Peny B. Ruano D. Vitorica J. Scatton B. Brain Res. 1993; 604: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the affinities for both ligands corresponded to those reported for recombinant receptors containing α1 subunits (high affinity binding sites) and α3 subunits (low affinity binding sites) (11Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1802-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 12Pritchett D.B. Luddens H. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 1389-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). In consequence, these results suggest the presence of benzodiazepine binding sites in both α1 and α3 subunits co-assembled in a single GABAA receptor complex (also see 17Khan Z.U. Gutierrez A. Deblas A.L. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).To discern whether both α1 and α3 subunits, co-assembled in a single complex, display benzodiazepine binding activity, the GABAA receptor was immunopurified by anti-α1 and anti-α3 affinity columns in series; therefore, the whole population of the isolated GABAA receptors should contain two different α subunits. It is noteworthy that anti-α3 immunoaffinity columns retained 20-25% of the α1-immunopurified GABAA receptors, corroborating the proportion of α1 to α3 GABAA receptors calculated by depletion experiments (compare Fig. 3A and Table II). Immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3B) indicates that α1 and α3 subunits are mainly associated with β2/3 and γ2 in the same receptor complex, consistent with previous experiments (21Ruano D. Araujo F. Machado A. De Blas A.L. Vitorica J. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 25: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Ruano D. Khan Z.U. De Blas A.L. Machado A. Vitorica J. Eur. J. Pharmacol Mol. Pharmacol. Sect. 1994; 267: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The β1 subunits are a relatively minor component of the receptor (41Benke D. Fritschy J.M. Trzeciak A. Bannwarth W. Mohler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27100-27107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, on the other hand, it has been demonstrated that γ1 is not associated with γ2-containing GABAA receptors (42Quirk K. Gillard N.P. Ragan C.I. Whiting P.J. McKernan R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1061-1070PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we propose a molecular composition of α1, α3, β2/3 and γ2 for these native GABAA receptor complexes from rat cortex.A relevant question to ascertain the pharmacological activity of the α subunits, co-assembled in a single native GABAA receptor, is the stoichiometry between both subunits in the complex. Thus, we have estimated the stoichiometry between both α subunits by quantifying the immunoreaction products of anti-α1 and anti-α3 antibodies in immunoblots. We are aware that immunoblots are only semiquantitative. However, within the limitations of the technique, the results (Fig. 4) indicated the presence of stoichiometric amounts of each α subunit (ratio 1:1; also see 16Pollard S. Thompson C.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21285-21290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar for discussion). The stoichiometry of γ2, β2, and β3 subunits was not determined.If both α subunits display benzodiazepine binding sites, the double-immunopurified receptors should display type I and II binding properties in similar proportions, and two peptides should be photoaffinity labeled by [3H]Ro15-4513 to a similar extent. Indeed, the pharmacological analysis of the α1-α3 GABAA receptors indicated the presence of two different benzodiazepine binding sites. Both Cl 218,872 and zolpidem discriminated between two different binding sites with high (type I) and low affinities (type II). The calculated Ki values for either ligand were similar to those of immunopurified α1 or α3 receptors (compare Table III, Table IV) and to cerebral membranes (6Ruano D. Vizuete M. Cano J. Machado A. Vitorica J. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Benavides J. Peny B. Ruano D. Vitorica J. Scatton B. Brain Res. 1993; 604: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the proportion between both binding sites (70:30 for high and low affinity, respectively) demonstrates that the α1 subunits are predominantly active over the α3 subunits. It could be argued that the different proportions between both binding sites, determined by displacement experiments, is due to differences in the KD values of α1 and α3 subunits for the 3H-labeled ligand ([3H]FNZ or [3H]FMZ). However, these results were confirmed by [3H]Ro15-4513 photoaffinity-labeling experiments at three different degrees of saturation. As expected, in the double-immunopurified receptors, two photolabeled peptides of 51 kDa (corresponding to α1 subunits) and 59-61 kDa (α3 subunits) were identified. However, despite the fact that both α subunits are assembled in stoichiometric amounts in the same receptor complex, the proportion between both photolabeled peptides (at all three concentrations) was 70:30 for 51 and 59-61 kDa, respectively (Fig. 5). Thus, α1 subunits are pharmacologically predominant over the α3 subunits. It should be noted that [3H]Ro15-4513 photolabeled most, if not all, the benzodiazepine binding sites from cerebral membranes (90% in this work; also see 43Sieghart W. Eichinger A. Richards J.G. Mohler H. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).Our data could be explained by the existence of at least two pharmacologically different populations of α1-α3 GABAA receptors (see Fig. 6 for a model). As shown in Fig. 6A, 70% of the α1-α3 GABAA receptors may be assembled by a functional α1 subunit associated with an inactive α3 subunit. The remaining 30% of the population may be constituted by a functional α3 subunit associated with inactive α1 subunits. Nevertheless, we cannot completely exclude the existence of α1-α3 GABAA receptors containing two benzodiazepine binding sites (Fig. 6B). In such a model, in which two functional α1 and α3 subunits are co-localized in the same receptor complex, 60% of the benzodiazepine binding sites should be conferred by GABAA receptors containing two functional α subunits and 30% by functional α1 subunits associated with inactive α3 subunits. Our results do not allow discrimination between these two models.The presence or absence of active benzodiazepine binding sites could be determined by the distribution of the α and γ2 subunits in the pentameric GABAA receptor complex (10Pritchett D.B. Sontheimer H. Shivers B.D. Ymer S. Kettenmann H. Schofield P.R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1989; 338: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 44Stephenson F.A. Duggan M.J. Pollard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21160-21165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that both α and γ2 subunits are implicated in the benzodiazepine binding sites (44Stephenson F.A. Duggan M.J. Pollard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21160-21165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-234PubMed Google Scholar), and, on the other hand, the GABAA receptors may contain two α subunits, two β subunits, and a single γ2 subunit (46Backus K.H. Arigoni M. Drescher U. Scheurer L. Malherbe P. Mohler H. Benson J.A. Neuroreport. 1993; 5: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 47Im W.B. Pregenzer J.F. Binder J.A. Dillon G.H. Alberts G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26063-26066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, the predominance of α1 pharmacology (type I benzodiazepine binding sites or the 51-kDa photolabeled peptides) could be interpreted by the presence of a single γ2 subunit properly associated with the α1 subunit in the α1-α3 GABAA receptor complex (Fig. 6A). In these receptors, the α3 subunits should lack the benzodiazepine binding sites (see Fig. 6). On the other hand, two different γ2 subunits could also co-exist in the same receptor complex (46Backus K.H. Arigoni M. Drescher U. Scheurer L. Malherbe P. Mohler H. Benson J.A. Neuroreport. 1993; 5: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 48Khan Z.U. Gutierrez A. De Blas A.L. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1466-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). If this is the case, both α subunits could display benzodiazepine binding properties (Fig. 6B).The physiological significance of GABAA receptors containing two different α subtypes, such as an α1-α3 combination, is unknown. The α1 subunit is highly and uniformly expressed in all cortical layers, whereas the expression of the α3 subunit is localized in layers V and VI (49Fritschy J.M. Mohler H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 359: 154-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Therefore, the α1- and α3-containing GABAA receptors should be restricted to these cortical layers. Co-localization of α1 and α3 subunits has been also observed in other discrete brain regions (such as mitral cells of the olfactory bulb and the medial septum; 49Fritschy J.M. Mohler H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 359: 154-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in recombinant GABAA receptors, the co-expression of α1, α3, β2, and γ2 subunits confers unique functional properties, distinct from GABAA receptors containing a single α subtype (50Verdoorn T.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 475-480PubMed Google Scholar, 51Ebert B. Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Krogsgaardlarsen P. Kemp J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 957-963PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence and pharmacological activity of two different α subunit subtypes in native receptor complexes, localized in discrete brain areas and/or cellular regions, could influence the functional and pharmacological properties of the GABAA receptor. The existence and pharmacological properties of α1α3-containing receptors increase the heterogeneity of the native GABAA receptor complex in the central nervous system.In summary, our results demonstrate the existence of cortical GABAA receptors containing both α1 and α3 subunits in stoichiometric amounts. Furthermore, both α subunits retained their benzodiazepine binding properties. However, the α1 subunit is pharmacologically predominant over α3 subunits, indicating the existence of active and nonactive benzodiazepine binding sites associated with these α subunits. INTRODUCTIONThe neuropharmacological effects of benzodiazepines are mediated by the benzodiazepine (ω) binding sites associated with the GABAA 1The abbreviations used are: GABAAγ-aminobutyric acidAPBSphosphate-buffered salineFMZflumazenilFNZflunitrazepammAbmonoclonal antibodyCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. receptor complex (for reviews, see 1Squires R.F.

Neurosci. 1985; 8: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on their affinity for different drugs, two different benzodiazepine binding sites have been identified in the central nervous system. Type I (benzodiazepine receptor 1, ω1) displays high affinity for CL 218,872 (2Tallman J.F. Gallager D.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1985; 8: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), β-carboline derivates (3Nielsen M. Braestrup C. Nature. 1980; 286: 606-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and the imidazopyridine zolpidem (4Arbilla S. Allen J. Wick A. Langer S.Z. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 130: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5Langer S.Z. Arbilla S. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1988; 29: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Type II (benzodiazepine receptor 2, ω2) displays low affinity for these compounds. A third benzodiazepine binding site with very low affinity for zolpidem (type IIL, ω5) has also been identified in isolated rat brain membranes (6Ruano D. Vizuete M. Cano J. Machado A. Vitorica J. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and sections (7Benavides J. Peny B. Ruano D. Vitorica J. Scatton B. Brain Res. 1993; 604: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Molecular cloning experiments have demonstrated the existence of five different families of subunits that are components of the GABAA receptor complex. Most of these families comprise several isoforms: α1-α6, β1-β3, γ1-γ3, δ, and ρ1 and ρ2 (for reviews, see 8Olsen R.W. Tobin A.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1469-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar and 9Burt D.R. Kamatchi G.L. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2916-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). A minimum of α, β, and γ subunits should be co-expressed in transfected cells to resemble all the pharmacological properties of native GABAA receptors (10Pritchett D.B. Sontheimer H. Shivers B.D. Ymer S. Kettenmann H. Schofield P.R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1989; 338: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the presence of different α subunits determines the affinity of the different benzodiazepine binding sites. In this sense, the α1-β1-β3-γ2 combination confers type I pharmacology to the recombinant GABAA receptor (i.e. high affinity for, among others, zolpidem and Cl 218,872) (11Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1802-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Type II properties are conferred by the presence of α2, α3, or α5 subunits (11Pritchett D.B. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1802-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 12Pritchett D.B. Luddens H. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 1389-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar).Several approaches have been taken to identify which subunits co-exist in the native GABAA receptor complex. However, the subunit composition of the different native GABAA receptor complexes remains unsolved. Immunoprecipitations or immunoaffinity purifications using anti-α subunit antibodies (anti-α1, -α2, -α3, -α5, and -α6 subunits) indicated that a significant proportion of native receptors are made by the association of two different α subunits (such as α1α2, α1α3, α1α5, or α1α6) (13Duggan M.J.

Neurochem. 1996; 66: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in a single receptor complex. However, other authors have indicated the absence of association between different α subunits (18McKernan R.M. Quirk K. Prince R. Cox P.A. Gillard N.P. Ragan C.I. Whiting P. Neuron. 1991; 7: 667-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 19Quirk K. Gillard N.P. Ragan C.I. Whiting P.J. McKernan R.M. J. Biol.

On the other hand, the pharmacological properties of these GABAA receptors are also unknown.In the present article we have addressed these questions by determining the molecular and pharmacological properties of the immunopurified receptors using subunit-specific antibodies to the major α subunits expressed in the rat cerebral cortex, the α1 and α3 subunits."

https://openalex.org/W2157538848,"Staphylokinase (STA), a protein of bacterial origin, induces highly fibrin-specific thrombolysis both in human plasma in vitro and in pilot clinical trials. Using fluorescence microscopy, we investigated the spatial distribution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled STA during lysis of a plasma clot and its binding to purified fibrin clots in the presence or in the absence of plasmin(ogen). STA highly accumulated in a thin superficial layer of the lysing plasma clot following the distribution of plasminogen (Pg) during lysis. Experiments with purified fibrin clots revealed that STA binds to Pg bound to partially degraded fibrin but not to Pg bound to intact fibrin. Binding of FITC-labeled STA to various forms of plasmin(ogen) in a buffer solution was studied by measuring fluorescence anisotropy. The binding constant for Glu-Pg was estimated as 7.4 μM and for Lys-Pg as 0.28 μM; for active-site blocked plasmin the binding constant was less than 0.05 μM. The much lower affinity of STA for Glu-Pg compared with that for active site- blocked plasmin was mainly due to a lower association rate constant, as assessed by real time biospecific interaction analysis. Gel filtration of a mixture of STA with a molar excess of Glu-Pg demonstrated that STA migrated as an unbound 18-kDa protein when activation of Pg into plasmin was precluded by inhibitors of plasmin. When gel-filtered under the same conditions with plasmin, STA migrated in complex with plasmin with an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa. Confocal fluorescence microscopy finally demonstrated that when FITC-labeled STA was added to plasma before clotting, it did not bind to fibrin fibers during the first minutes (lag phase), although Pg bound to the fibers moderately. Then, both Pg and STA started to accumulate on the fibers progressively, followed by complete lysis of the clot. In conclusion, our results imply that, when STA is added to plasma, only a small percentage associates with Pg. In contrast, STA binds strongly to plasmin and to Pg, which is bound to partially degraded fibrin. These findings add a new mechanism to the known explanations for the inefficient Pg activation by STA in plasma and specify the mechanism for fibrin-dependent activation of Pg.

https://openalex.org/W2036211658,"Recently, we have shown that the dopamine D1B/D5 receptor displays binding and coupling properties that are reminiscent of those of the constitutively activated G protein-coupled receptors when compared with the related D1A/D1 receptor subtype (Tiberi, M., and Caron, M.

The carboxyl-terminal region of the third cytoplasmic loop of several G protein-coupled receptors has been demonstrated to be important for the regulation of the equilibrium between inactive and active receptor conformations. In this cytoplasmic region, the primary structure of dopamine D1A and D1B receptors differs by only two residues: Phe264/Arg266 are present in D1A receptor compared with Ile288/Lys290 in the D1B receptor. To investigate whether these structural differences could account for the distinct binding and coupling properties of these dopamine receptor subtypes, we swapped the variant residues located in the carboxyl-terminal region by site-directed mutagenesis. The exchange of the D1A receptor residue Phe264 by the D1B receptor counterpart isoleucine led to a D1A receptor mutant exhibiting D1B-like constitutive properties. In contrast, substitution of D1B receptor Ile288 by the D1A receptor counterpart phenylalanine resulted in a loss of constitutive activation of the D1B receptor with binding and coupling properties similar to the D1A receptor. The Arg/Lys substitution had no effect on the function of either receptor. These results demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal region, and in particular residue Ile288, is a major determinant of the constitutive activity of the dopamine D1B receptor.

Arthritis Rheum. 1992; 35: 1520-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) extended these studies by demonstrating that native adult articular cartilage also underwent ATP-dependent mineralization, as had isolated ACV, supporting the contention that vesicles foster adult articular cartilage mineralization in situ. This in vitro system may serve as a model for the study of chondrocalcinosis caused by BCP and CPPD. Our present understanding of the mechanisms of pathological calcification is limited; therefore, no reliable method has been devised to prevent calcium crystal deposition. Phosphocitrate (PC) is a naturally occurring compound that has been identified in mammalian mitochondria (9Tew W.P. Malis C.D. Howard J.E. Lehninger A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5528-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and crab hepatopancreas (10Howard J.E. Johns Hopkins Med. J. 1976; 139: 239-252PubMed Google Scholar). It has been speculated that PC may have an important role in preventing calcium phosphate precipitation in cells or cellular compartments maintaining high concentrations of calcium and phosphate (10Howard J.E. Johns Hopkins Med. J. 1976; 139: 239-252PubMed Google Scholar). PC prevents soft tissue calcification in vivo and does not produce any significant toxic side effect in rats or mice when administered through intraperitoneal injections in doses up to 150 μmol/kg/day (11Shankar R. Crowden S. Sallis J.D. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 50: 191-198Google Scholar, 12Brown M.R. Sallis J.D. Schwille P.O. Smith L.H. Robertson W.G. Vahlensieck W. Urolithiasis and Related Clinical Research. Plenum Press, New York1985: 891-894Crossref Google Scholar). Although PC is a potent in vitro inhibitor of BCP (11Shankar R. Crowden S. Sallis J.D. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 50: 191-198Google Scholar, 13Sallis J.D. Brown M.R. Parker N.M. Sikes C.S. Wheeler A.P. Surface Reactive Peptide and Polymers.

Scanning Microsc. 1995; 9: 127-136PubMed Google Scholar), it was not known whether PC had any inhibitory effect on CPPD crystallization. In the present study, we examine the effect of citrate, PC, and n-sulfo-2-amino-tricarballylate (SAT, a PC analogue) (Fig. 1) on the ATP-induced CPPD crystal formation in both ACV and native articular cartilage models. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Hanks' balanced salt solution without calcium and magnesium (HBSS), fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone, and HEPES buffer were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. 45Ca-labeled CaCl2 was from Amersham Corp. [γ-32P]ATP was from obtained from DuPont NEN. Collagenase, trypsin, hyaluronidase, ATP, sodium pyrophosphate decahydrate, AMP, citrate, and yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase were from Sigma. Protein assay reagents for cell protein measurements were from Bio-Rad [Richmond, CA]. PC was prepared as the sodium salt by phosphorylation of tribenyl citrate followed by deprotection through hydrogenation. The monosodium salt was crystallized from water (16Pankowski A.H. Meehan J.D. Sallis J.D. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 927-930Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). SAT was synthesized according to the procedure of Brown et al. (12Brown M.R. Sallis J.D. Schwille P.O. Smith L.H. Robertson W.G. Vahlensieck W. Urolithiasis and Related Clinical Research. Plenum Press, New York1985: 891-894Crossref Google Scholar). ACV isolation and mineralization were done according to the procedure outlined by Derfus et al. (4Derfus B.A. Rachow J.W. Mandel N.S. Boskey A.L. Buday M. Kushnaryov V.M. Ryan L.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1992; 35: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Derfus B. Steinberg M. Mandel N. Buday M. Daft L. Ryan L. J. Rheumatol. 1995; 22: 1514-1519PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hyaline articular cartilage was obtained from femoral condyles and patellae of freshly slaughtered pigs. Cartilage slices were sequentially treated with 0.1% (w/v) hyaluronidase and 0.5% (w/v) trypsin for 10 min each and then digested with 0.05% (w/v) collagenase overnight. The cartilage digest was serially centrifuged in a Beckman L-8-80M ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Irvine, CA) according to the following protocol: 300 × g for 10 min to remove intact cells; 20,000 × g for 10 min to remove larger cell fragments; 50,000 × g for 60 min to pellet the HVF; and then 200,000 × g for 40 min to pellet LVF. The ACV fractions were washed twice and resuspended in HBSS to a final concentration of 3-6 mg of protein/ml. ACV mineralization was assayed in the presence or absence of test inhibitors (PC, SAT, or citrate) in a calcifying salt solution (CSS) containing 2.2 mM CaCl2, 1.6 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM MgCl2, 85 mM NaCl, 15 mM KCl, 10 mM NaHCO3, 50 mM n-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, and 1 mM ATP, pH 7.6. Twenty-five microliters of ACV suspension was added to 500 μl of CSS in 1.5-ml polypropylene tubes, vortexed, and incubated in a 37°C water bath. CSS was labeled with 1 μCi/ml of 45Ca. After 48 h, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant was removed, and pellet was washed twice by resuspension in 500 μl of ice-cold CSS without ATP and centrifuged after each wash at 10,000 × g for 10 min. 45Ca contained in the mineral phase was solubilized with concentrated HCl and counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. A native articular cartilage mineralization assay was performed according to Ryan et al. (8Ryan L.M. Kurup I.V. Derfus B.A. Kushnaryov V.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1992; 35: 1520-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, pig hyaline articular cartilage slices were cultured in a 20-fold (v/wet weight) volume of 50 mM HEPES-buffered DMEM, pH 7.4, containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Medium was trace-labeled with 45Ca (1 μCi/ml). ATP-dependent mineralization in the presence or absence of test inhibitors was measured as cartilage retention of 45Ca counts after incubation with ATP. A concentrated stock solution of 0.1 M ATP in buffered DMEM was freshly prepared and added to the explant cultures to bring the media to 100 μM with respect to ATP. After 48 h the incubations were terminated by transferring cartilage to a separate plate and washing extensively with buffered DMEM. Cartilage was then hydrolyzed by heating to 70°C in 6 N HCl for 1 h. Aliquots of the digest were counted for 45Ca. To determine the chemical form of phosphate precipitated, triplicate preparations of porcine cartilage and porcine chondrocyte monolayers were trace-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP instead of 45Ca. The resultant mineral was isolated by centrifugation after digestion with collagenase (2 mg/ml in DMEM) overnight. The pellet was washed with DMEM, resuspended, and dissolved in 200 μl of 2 mM EDTA in water. Dissolved mineral containing 32P was then diluted in DMEM to 500 μl. An aliquot was assessed for content of 32P inorganic phosphate (Pi) using the method of Sugino and Miyoshi (17Sugino Y. Miyoshi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2360-2364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another aliquot was treated for 1 h at 37°C with bakers' yeast pyrophosphatase (2units/ml) and then analyzed for [32P]Pi content by the same method. The amount of PPi was determined as the difference between Pi present before and after digestion with pyrophosphatase. Twice washed ACV mineral from the 48-h incubation was examined using a compensated polarized light microscope (Leitz, Midland, Ontario, Canada). Samples from similar incubation but in the presence of PC were examined for comparison. The presence of PPi was confirmed by testing positively birefringent crystals for susceptibility to dissolution with bakers' yeast pyrophosphatase (10 μl of a 2.0 unit/ml stock solution of bakers' yeast pyrophosphatase in HBSS containing 0.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.4 mM MgSO4 for 1 h at 37°C). The NTPPPH enzyme activity assay was performed by combining a 100-μl ACV suspension with 100 μl of 2 mM thymidine monophosphate n-nitrophenyl ester, 50 mM HEPES-buffered HBSS, pH 7.4. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 h before terminating the reaction by the addition of 800 μl of 0.1 N NaOH. The p-nitrophenol product was determined by spectrophotometer at 410 nm. Triple determinations were made on all samples. NTPPPH activity is expressed as nmol of p-nitrophenol formed/h/mg of protein (18Rachow J.W. Ryan L.M. McCarty D.J. Halverson P.B. Arthritis Rheum. 1988; 31: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19Masuda I. Hamada J.I. Haas A.L. Ryan L.M. McCarty D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 699-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements are expressed as the means ± S.D. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare paired samples. The effects of PC, SAT, and citrate on the mineralization of HVF and LVF in the presence or absence of ATP are summarized in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. Only PC (1 mM) blocked both the ATP-dependent and -independent mineralization in both HVF and LVF. At 1 mM, SAT and citrate only blocked the ATP-independent mineralization. Fig. 3 shows that PC (10 μM to 1 mM) inhibited ATP-dependent mineralization in both ACV fractions in a significantly (p < 0.01) dose-dependent manner. Fig. 4 confirmed that only PC blocked both the ATP and ATP-independent mineralization in native articular cartilage slices.Fig. 4Effect of PC and citrate on native articular cartilage mineralization. The mineralization assay was performed according to Ryan et al. (6Ryan L.M. Wortmann R.L. Karas B. McCarty D.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1984; 27: 404-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” In a typical experiment, seven groups of explants were studied: one with no added ATP (0); another with ATP added at time 0 (1); and with ATP added twice (0 and 8 h) (2); 3 times (0, 8, and 16 h) (3), 4 times (0, 8, 16, and 24 h) (4); 5 times (0, 8, 16, 24, and 32 h) (5); and 6 times (0, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 h) (6). After 48 h, the incubations were concluded by transferring cartilage to a separate plate and washing extensively with buffered DMEM. Cartilage was then hydrolyzed by heating to 70°C in 6 N HCl for 1 h. Aliquots of the digest were counted for 45Ca. ▪, control; x, citrate; , PC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As previously shown by Derfus et al. (7Derfus B. Steinberg M. Mandel N. Buday M. Daft L. Ryan L. J. Rheumatol. 1995; 22: 1514-1519PubMed Google Scholar), HVF possessed approximately 3-4-fold higher NTPPPH specific activity than LVF. PC, SAT, and citrate had no effect on NTPPPH activity in either ACV fraction in the presence or absence of ATP (Fig. 5), suggesting that none of these agents blocked mineralization through the inhibition of NTPPPH activity (7Derfus B. Steinberg M. Mandel N. Buday M. Daft L. Ryan L. J. Rheumatol. 1995; 22: 1514-1519PubMed Google Scholar, 20Siegel S.A. Hummel C.F. Carty R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8601-8607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When mineral was trace-labeled with 32P derived from [γ-32P]ATP, most of the 32P moiety was in the form of PPi. Mineral produced in the control cultures contained 95% [32P]PPi and 5% [32P]Pi (monolayers) and 97% PPi and 3% Pi (cartilage). In the presence of PC, although the total amount of mineral was greatly reduced, mineral phase was still predominantly PPi (97% PPi in monolayer and 96% in cartilage). Compensated polarized light microscopy of similarly prepared samples incubated in the absence of PC confirmed a population of strongly positively birefringent, rod-shaped crystals. This appearance is very similar to that of CPPD crystals (data not shown). Exposure of ACV mineral to pyrophosphatase eliminated all of these birefringent crystals, thereby confirming their PPi content. HVF ATP-dependent mineralization as a function of delayed addition of PC (1 mM) is summarized in Fig. 6. PC similarly inhibited mineralization (∼70%) when added up to 6 h after the incubation began. With a delayed addition of PC at 24 and 30 h of incubation, the inhibitory effect of PC on mineralization diminished to 42 and 34%, respectively, suggesting that PC may have slowed crystal growth subsequent to nucleation. In the present study, both the ACV and the native adult cartilage models were used to examine the effect of PC, SAT (PC analogue), and citrate on the ATP-dependent and -independent mineralization. The native cartilage model complements the ACV model, because it eliminates the effects that ACV release and isolation procedures may have on mineralizing capacity. It also allows mineralization to occur in unaltered cartilage matrix. Since PC blocked both ATP-dependent and -independent mineralization in both systems, diffusion of PC through the cartilage matrix to block mineralization in cartilage is likely. Recently, Kranendonk et al. (21Kranendonk S. Ryan L.M. Buday M. Lynch K. Derfus B.A. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Orthopedic Trans. 1994; 18: 502-503Google Scholar) reported that CPPD-like crystals were the predominant species formed in the presence of ATP, while BCP crystals were the primary crystals formed in the absence of ATP in the ACV mineralization model. Since PC, SAT, and citrate are known inhibitors of BCP crystal formation (11Shankar R. Crowden S. Sallis J.D. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 50: 191-198Google Scholar, 13Sallis J.D. Brown M.R. Parker N.M. Sikes C.S. Wheeler A.P. Surface Reactive Peptide and Polymers. American Chemical Society, New York1991: 149-160Google Scholar), our present results (Figs. 2, 3, 4) would support the notion that in the absence of ATP, BCP crystal formation would be blocked by all three compounds. Since only PC blocked ATP-induced mineralization in ACV (both HVF and LVF) and cartilage explants, this provides the first evidence suggesting that PC can specifically inhibit the formation or growth of CPPD crystals. As in the ACV system, the cartilage explant mineralization requires hydrolysis of ATP to produce PPi. NTPPPH is the enzyme responsible for generation of PPi from extracellular ATP in cartilage (22Tenenbaum J. Muniz O. Schemacher H.R. Good A.E. Howell D.S. Arthritis Rheum. 1981; 24: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Ryan L.M. Rachow J.W. McCarty D.J. J. Rheum. 1991; 18: 716-720PubMed Google Scholar). It is a membrane-associated ectoenzyme found in cell membrane and vesicle fraction of adult articular cartilage (6Ryan L.M. Wortmann R.L. Karas B. McCarty D.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1984; 27: 404-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Howell D.S. Martel-Pelletier J. Pelletier J.P. Morales S. Munoz O. Arthritis Rheum. 1984; 27: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since PC, SAT, or citrate had little effect on the NTPPPH enzyme activity in both HVF and LVF (Fig. 5), the possibility that PC inhibits CPPD crystal formation through inhibition of NTPPPH activity is unlikely (7Derfus B. Steinberg M. Mandel N. Buday M. Daft L. Ryan L. J. Rheumatol. 1995; 22: 1514-1519PubMed Google Scholar, 20Siegel S.A. Hummel C.F. Carty R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8601-8607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies with PC have established that it powerfully restricts transformations involved in the nucleation, growth, and aggregation of many calcium salts including phosphate, oxalate, and carbonate (13Sallis J.D. Brown M.R. Parker N.M. Sikes C.S. Wheeler A.P. Surface Reactive Peptide and Polymers. American Chemical Society, New York1991: 149-160Google Scholar, 14Wierzbicki A. Sikes C.S. Sallis J.D.

Plenum Press, New York1995: 87-98Google Scholar). The strong binding affinity that PC possesses for growing crystals accounts for the superior inhibitory capacity compared with citrate and SAT and is believed to result from both its multinegative charges (Fig. 1) and natural stereochemistry (28Ward L.C. Shankar R. Sallis J.D. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 65: 117-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recent insights into the mechanism of PC action have been gained by exploring its interaction with the crystal faces of calcium oxalate monohydrate using both experimental evidence and computer modeling (14Wierzbicki A. Sikes C.S. Sallis J.D. Madura J.D. Stevens E.D. Martin K.L. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1995; 56: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Sallis J.D. Parry N.F.G. Meehan J.D. Kamperman H. Anderson M.E. Scanning Microsc. 1995; 9: 127-136PubMed Google Scholar). PC with both its PO4 and carboxylate groups contributing has been shown to bind more favorably than citrate (possessing carboxylates only) with calcium ions distributed on the (−1 0 1) and (0 1 0) surfaces of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystal, thus blocking growth. We speculate that the inhibitory action of PC on the CPPD unit cell lattice, although different from calcium oxalate monohydrate or BCP, would be achieved by a similar inhibitory mechanism, and this aspect is currently being explored. SAT is not as efficient an inhibitor as PC for calcium salts examined so far, which probably reflects its stereochemistry and the fact that both a sulfate moiety (one less charge than PO4) and the presence of a nitrogen atom reduce its capacity to position itself correctly for crystal face interaction. Our earlier studies had shown that PC specifically inhibits CPPD and BCP crystal-induced metalloproteinase synthesis and mitogenesis in human fibroblasts in vitro, while PC has no effect on similar biologic responses induced by epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and serum (29Cheung H.S. Rev. Bras. Reumatol. 1994; 34: S117-119Google Scholar). PC prevents disease progression in murine progressive ankylosis (an animal model of crystal deposition diseases), a condition marked by extensive BCP deposition (30Krug H.E. Mahowald M.L. Halverson P.B. Cheung H.S. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 1603-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Taken together with the present data, PC may be considered a potential therapeutic agent for both CPPD and BCP crystal deposition diseases. Our working hypothesis is that PC will have dual beneficial effects of blocking the degeneration-promoting effects of crystals e.g. metalloproteinase synthesis and mitogenesis (30Krug H.E. Mahowald M.L. Halverson P.B. Cheung H.S. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 1603-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Cheung H.S. Sallis J.D. Struve J.A. Biochem. Biophys.

In our laboratory, we have been interested in the brain P-450 monooxygenase system, and our studies have revealed evidence for the existence and functionality of multiple forms of P-450 (9Strobel H.W.

Recently, Sequeira and Strobel demonstrated brain microsomal catalytic activities toward imipramine and showed differences in the effects of the inducers on liver and brain imipramine metabolism (14Sequeira D.J. Strobel H.W. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Appl. 1995; 673: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thereafter, we cloned from a rat brain cDNA library two cDNA clones, termed 2d-29 and 2d-35, which have an identical open reading frame and code for a novel brain P-450 belonging to the CYP2D subfamily. The difference between the two clones is that cDNA clone 2d-29 has a foreshortened 3′-untranslated sequence with a poly(A) tail. We further showed that the mRNA of the longer clone, 2d-35, was expressed in the brain but not in the liver (1Kawashima H. Strobel H.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although they code for a P-450 protein, which differs from CYP2D4 (15Ishida N. Tawaragi Y. Inuzuka C. Sugita O. Kubota I.

Evol. 1990; 30: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) by only 5 amino acids in the C-terminal region, clones 2d-29 and 2d-35 have unique 5′-untranslated sequences. In order to investigate whether or not this brain CYP2D is a distinct form, we screened a rat genomic library resulting in the demonstration shown in this report that the 5′-untranslated sequence of this novel brain P-450 2D is derived from a gene distinct from CYP2D4, suggesting that the expression of this P-450 is regulated differently. Thus, this P-450 was named CYP2D18 according to the recommended nomenclature (2Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we expressed the protein product of CYP2D18 using COS-M6 cells and performed an analysis of the catalytic capabilities of the expressed recombinant protein. -A rat genomic library (catalog number RL1022j) was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA); [α-32P]dATP (3,000 mCi/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 mCi/mmol) were from ICN (Irvine, CA); [35S]methionine (1,000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Corp.; pure nitrocellulose membrane and Nytran filters were from Schleicher & Schuell; Qiagen Lambda Kit was from QIAGEN (Chatsworth, CA); TNT T3-coupled reticulocyte lysate system was from Promega (Madison, WI); DNA labeling kit (strand-specific DNA probe synthesis kit) and S1 nuclease protection assay kit were from Ambion (Austin, TX). All restriction enzymes were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) or Promega. Imipramine hydrochloride was purchased from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA); desipramine hydrochloride was from Sigma. 2-hydroxyimipramine and 10-hydroxyimipramine were gifts from Ciba-Geigy (Basel, Switzerland). Anti-P-450 2D6 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Gentest (Woburn, MA). The expression vector pcDNAI and COS-M6 cells were generous gifts from Dr. Tetsu Kamitani (University of Texas Medical School). -A probe for screening the rat genomic library was prepared by PCR using P-450 2D18 cDNA as a template with a pair of primers as follows; 5′-AGTGGATCCTCCTCTGAGTTT, designated 29S1, and 5′-AAAGCCCGACTGGTCATTGAA, designated 29A2. As shown in Fig. 1C, the PCR product covered the N-terminal coding sequence and the unique 5′-untranslated sequence. The probe was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primer method, and hybridization was carried out at 65°C in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) sodium N-lauroylsarcosinate, 0.2% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2% (w/v) Ficoll, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The filters were washed twice at 65°C for 30 min in 0.2 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate) and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. The positive plaques were purified through one more round of screening. -Phage DNA of positive plaques was digested with SacI (the site for which is located just outside of the cloning site of the DNA insert to EMBL3 SP6/T7), electrophoresed on 0.6% agarose gel, transferred to a Nytran filter, and hybridized with the same probe under the same conditions as used in screening. The filter was washed twice at 65°C for 30 min in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS solution. In order to detect the unique 5′-untranslated sequence of CYP2D18 in genomic DNA, the same filter was prepared and hybridized at 42°C with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide, 5′-AGGCTCCAGACTTCTCGACTT, which is designated 29S2 and located in the unique 5′-untranslated sequence of CYP2D18. The filter was then washed in 6 × SSC and 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate solution for 40 min with a gradual increase of temperature from 42 to 56°C. -Restriction enzyme fragments of phage DNA were subcloned into pBluescript SK−, and the sequence analysis was performed using deletion clones prepared using Exo nuclease III and Mung bean nuclease (Stratagene). Sequence reactions were performed using Taq FS dye primer cycle sequence system (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed by an automated sequencer model 377 (Applied Biosystems). All the sequencings were performed in both directions. -A strand-specific DNA probe internally labeled with [α-32P]dATP was synthesized using an oligonucleotide, 5′-AAGTCGAGAAGTCTGGAGCCT, as a primer which is an antisense sequence located in the 5′-untranslated sequence of CYP2D18. The template used was a linearized deletion clone of the EcoRI fragment of the CYP2D18 gene, which generated a 0.4-kb DNA probe. The strand-specific DNA probe was then hybridized with rat brain mRNA and total RNA, rat liver mRNA and total RNA, and yeast RNA as a control in a hybridization solution containing 80% deionized formamide, 100 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.4), 300 mM sodium acetate (pH 6.4), and 1 mM EDTA at 42°C overnight, digested with 15 units of S1 nuclease at 37°C for 30 min, and analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide/8 M urea gel followed by autoradiography. -In vitro translation was carried out using the TNT T3-coupled reticulocyte system (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA of CYP2D18 cloned into pBluescript SK− was used without modification as a template. The 35S-labeled translation products were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. -The CYP2D18 cDNA insert was subcloned into a transient mammalian expression vector pcDNAI between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the vector without further modification. Transfection of the host cells was performed by the DEAE-dextran method (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associate & John Wiley & Sons, NY1993: 16.13.1-16.13.7Google Scholar). The cells from 4 culture dishes (100 mm) were harvested 72 h after transfection, suspended in 150 μl of lysate buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M sucrose, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.04 units/ml aprotinin), and sonicated three times for 5 s. -SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar), and immunoblot analysis was carried out according to the method of Towbin et al. (19Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. The metabolism of imipramine was determined as described previously (14Sequeira D.J. Strobel H.W. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Appl. 1995; 673: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In short, the reaction was carried out in 100 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.25) using 1 mM imipramine, 1.4 mg of cell lysate, 4 units/ml NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and an NADPH-generating system containing 5 mM glucose 6-phosphate, 0.5 mM NADP+, and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase in a total volume of 250 μl. For extraction of N-demethylation products, the reaction mixture was alkalinized to pH 12 and extracted using 3 volumes of heptane containing 1.5% isoamyl alcohol. To the heptane extract, 0.5 volume of 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 5.9) was added and mixed, and the aqueous layer was separated. The aqueous layer was again extracted with heptane as above. For hydroxylation products, the aqueous layer from the first extraction with heptane was collected, acidified to pH 9.0, and extracted with ethylene dichloride. Finally, the extracts were evaporated to dryness, and the residues were dissolved in 0.1 ml of methanol and subjected to reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using a 25 cm × 4.6 mm cyanopropylmethylsilyl column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) with continuous monitoring at 214 nm. The mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile/methanol/0.01 M K2HPO4, pH 7.0 (40:30:30, v/v/v), and the flow rate was 1.4 ml/min. The elution times for N-demethylated metabolite (desipramine), substrate, and 10-hydroxyimipramine were 14.1, 8.9, and 7.9 min., respectively. In order to determine whether our brain subfamily 2D P-450 is derived from a gene distinct from liver CYP2D4, 1,800,000 plaques from a rat genomic library were screened with a 503-bp PCR product designated 29S1A2 as a probe. The PCR product probe covers the 5′-untranslated sequence and the N-terminal region of the novel clone (Fig. 1C). After two rounds of screening, 6 positive clones were obtained. Fig. 1 shows the Southern blot analysis of these 6 positive clones hybridized with the common probe, 29S1A2 (Fig. 1A) and a CYP2D18-specific oligonucleotide, 29S2 (Fig. 1B). In lanes 2 and 6 of Fig. 1 (A and B), bands of approximately 3.5 kb that hybridized with both the common probe 29S1A2 and the CYP2D18-specific oligonucleotide probe were observed, whereas in the other lanes, only hybridization bands with the common probe were detected. The clones that hybridized only with the common probe probably reflect the CYP2D4 gene or another CYP2D gene of high similarity with 2D4. These results reveal that the unique 5′-untranslated sequence of the novel brain P-450 is derived from a gene distinct from CYP2D4. Thus, this P-450 was named CYP2D18 according to the recommended nomenclature (2Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar). -The nucleotide sequence of the 5′-upstream region of CYP2D18 gene is shown in Fig. 2. The putative transcription start site, indicated as +1 in Fig. 2, was determined by S1 mapping analysis (Fig. 3). The 5′-flanking sequence of CYP2D18 is quite different from that of CYP2D4, which was reported to have “a slightly atypical TATA sequence and no CCAAT sequence” (16Matsunaga E. Umeno M. Gonzalez F.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking sequence of CYP2D18 has no putative TATA sequence nor CAAT box close to the transcription start site, and it has typical TATA-less features such as having a very GC-rich sequence close to the transcription start site and other putative transcription start sites shown by weaker protection bands seen in Fig. 3B. Two glucocorticoid responsive element “half-sites” (TGTTCT) (20Schuetz J.D. Schuetz E.G. Thottassery J.V. Guzelian P.S. Strom S. Sun D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 63-72PubMed Google Scholar) were found separated by 200 bp at nucleotides −564 and −766, although further study is needed to show whether these sequences are related to the regulation of CYP2D18 expression or not.Fig. 3RNA mapping with S1 nuclease. A, a strand-specific DNA probe internally labeled with [α-32P]dATP was synthesized using a oligonucleotide bearing an antisense sequence in the 5′-unique extension of CYP2D18 cDNA as a primer and a deletion clone of CYP2D18 gene as a template, generating a 0.4-kb probe. B, the probe was then hybridized with rat brain mRNA and total RNA, and rat liver mRNA and total RNA, followed by S1 nuclease digestion. The protected bands of 128 bp in size are indicated by the arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) -A strand-specific DNA probe was synthesized using an antisense sequence within the unique 5′-untranslated sequence of CYP2D18 as a primer. The template used was a deletion clone of the EcoRI fragment of the CYP2D18 gene generating a 0.4-kb DNA probe (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, the lanes containing brain mRNA, liver mRNA, and liver total RNA showed protection bands of 128 bp in size. Weaker and broader bands were also detected 4-5 bp above the 128-bp bands. Due to a low expression level of 2D18 in brain as previously shown in Northern blot analysis (1Kawashima H. Strobel H.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we used 5 μg of mRNA and 50 μg of total RNA for hybridization and a longer exposure time for autoradiography to obtain visible protection bands. The observation that the intensity of bands in the lanes containing liver samples is the same or rather weaker than that of brain mRNA suggests the existence of CYP2D18 in liver at a low expression level. Prior to expressing the recombinant protein product in mammalian cells, in vitro transcription/translation reactions were performed using the TNT T3-coupled reticulocyte system with CYP2D18 cDNA, 2d-29, and 2d-35, as templates without further modification. The data of Fig. 4A show bands of the predicted size range (50 kDa) on SDS-PAGE in both lanes containing cDNA 2d-29 and 2d-35. In order to show that the protein product expressed in COS cells is a member of the P-450 2D subfamily, immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-P-450 2D6 (21Gonzalez F.J. Vilbois F. Hardwick J.P. McBride O.W. Nebert D.W. Gelboin H.V. Meyer U.A. Genomics. 1988; 2: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) polyclonal antibody. Transfection of COS-M6 cells was performed with the expression vector pcDNAI carrying the CYP2D18 cDNA insert. Cells transfected with expression vector only were prepared as a control, and cells expressing CYP4F4 and CYP4F6, also isolated from the brain cDNA library (22Kawashima H. Strobel H.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), were likewise prepared for comparison. As shown in Fig. 4B, protein immunoblot analysis of the P-450 2D18-expressed cell lysate with anti-P-450 2D6 (21Gonzalez F.J. Vilbois F. Hardwick J.P. McBride O.W. Nebert D.W. Gelboin H.V. Meyer U.A. Genomics. 1988; 2: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) antibody gave a cross-reacting band with a molecular mass of 50 kDa, which was identical to the size shown in the in vitro translation study, whereas neither control cells nor CYP4F4-expressed cells showed reaction bands with anti-P-450 2D6 antibody. The catalytic activity toward imipramine (14Sequeira D.J. Strobel H.W. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Appl. 1995; 673: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was determined using control cells and CYP2D18- and CYP4F6-expressed cell lysates as described above. As shown in Fig. 5 B, CYP2D18-expressed cell lysate showed significant catalytic activity toward imipramine N-demethylation. On the other hand, we were able to detect significant imipramine 10-hydroxylation activity using a CYP4F6-expressed cell lysate (Fig. 5C). The calculated catalytic activities obtained by subtracting the background values of control COS cells from the values of CYP2D18- or CYP4F6-expressed COS cell lysate were 2.1 pmol/min/mg protein for N-demethylation by CYP2D-expressed COS cells and 2.7 pmol/min/mg protein for 10-hydroxylation by CYP4F6-expressed COS cell lysate. These data show a metabolite specificity of the two isoforms resulting in either N-demethylation or hydroxylation. Because P-450 isoenzymes are intensively studied in liver, antibodies and protein or nucleotide sequence data from liver isoforms are usually employed to investigate the P-450 monooxygenase systems in extrahepatic tissues such as brain, in which P-450 content and mRNA expression level seem to be lower. In our laboratory we have cloned from a rat brain cDNA library new P-450 isozymes including CYP4F4, 4F5, 4F6 (22Kawashima H. Strobel H.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and CYP2D18 (1Kawashima H. Strobel H.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Among them, the family 2D P-450 is a point of focus due to a possible correlation between this subfamily of isoenzymes and disorders of the central nervous system (5Barbeau A. Cloutier T. Roy M. Plasse L. Paris S. Poirier J. Lancet. 1985; 2: 1213-1216Abstract PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 6Tsuneoka Y. Matsuo Y. Iwahashi K. Takeuchi H. Ichikawa Y. J. Biochem.

FASEB J. 1992; 6: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Komori has reported the isolation from a rat brain cDNA library of a partial cDNA clone of P-450 2D4 (23Komori M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Wyss et al. have recently published that they have cloned CYP2D4 cDNA from rat brain mRNA by reverse transcription PCR and that they have detected CYP2D4 protein in a brain P-450 fraction by immunoblot analysis (24Wyss A. Gustafsson J.-Å. Warner M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1148-1155PubMed Google Scholar). In our hands, all the positive clones sequenced during the cloning of CYP2D18 cDNA from a rat brain library had the 2D18-specific 5′-extension except one partial clone without an N-terminal sequence, suggesting that reliable distinction between CYP2D4 and 2D18 is best obtained using the 5′- or 3′-untranslated region unique sequence. Thus, the weight of the evidence from isolation of these clones reflects the expression of CYP2D18 in brain. Furthermore, our Northern blot analysis showed that a strong hybridization band in the lane containing the liver sample was shorter in size than a weak hybridization band in brain (data not shown), indicating the major expression of CYP2D4 or other members of the CYP2D subfamily in liver, because 2D18 cDNA is longer by a 0.15-kb unique extension than those forms as reported by Mastunaga et al. (16Matsunaga E. Umeno M. Gonzalez F.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, as shown in the S1 mapping results, CYP2D18 is expressed in brain and at a very low level in liver as well. Also the results of our Northern blot analysis are quite consistent with those published by Wyss et al. (24Wyss A. Gustafsson J.-Å. Warner M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1148-1155PubMed Google Scholar) in which two hybridization bands corresponding in size to cDNA 2d-29 and 2d-35 were shown in lanes containing brain mRNA. The sequence of the 5′-flanking region and exon 1 as shown in Fig. 2 demonstrates that the 5′-unique extension of CYP2D18 is derived from a gene distinct from the CYP2D4 gene whose sequence was reported by Matsunaga et al. (16Matsunaga E. Umeno M. Gonzalez F.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). That the Matsunaga sequence for CYP2D4 is correct was confirmed by a partial cDNA sequence for CYP2D4 reported earlier by Ishida et al. (15Ishida N. Tawaragi Y. Inuzuka C. Sugita O. Kubota I. Nakazato H. Noguchi T. Sassa S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). On the other hand, our previous report (1Kawashima H. Strobel H.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrated that two cDNA clones of CYP2D18 (i.e. 2d-29 and 2d-35) have identical coding sequences that are distinct and separate from that of CYP2D4. These points confirm the sequence differences between CYP2D4 and CYP2D18. If those differences were those of allelic variants, it would not be very likely that the two genes would have such different 5′-upstream sequences. In order to investigate the differential expression of CYP2D18 and 2D4, another S1 nuclease protection assay using a probe bearing a unique 5′-extension of 2D18 and a common sequence was performed, demonstrating the existence of 2D18 both in liver and brain. On the other hand, it seems that the expression level of CYP2D4 was too low to detect the protection bands in either brain or liver (data not shown). These data are consistent with the low expression levels of CYP2D4 in liver reported by Matsunaga et al. (16Matsunaga E. Umeno M. Gonzalez F.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). CYP2D4 was first cloned as a partial cDNA from rat liver (15Ishida N. Tawaragi Y. Inuzuka C. Sugita O. Kubota I. Nakazato H. Noguchi T. Sassa S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the intron-exon structure was determined by the cloning of genomic DNA (16Matsunaga E. Umeno M. Gonzalez F.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Neither the purification of CYP2D4 protein nor a full functional study of this form has been performed previously. Therefore, further studies on the characterization of this particular form of P-450 would seem in order to define further the role of 2D4 in liver. Recently, several studies have defined the aromatase cytochrome P-450 gene structure as consisting of nine exons, II-X, encoding the protein sequence and multiple exons I containing the 5′-untranslated sequences (25Harada N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 26Mahendroo M.S. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9463-19470Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 27Honda S.-I. Harada N. Takagi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochem. 1995; 231: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Each exon I with a putative promoter region is transcribed in a tissue-specific manner, and alternative splicing results in forming mRNA with the same protein encoding sequence. A possible explanation of the CYP2D18 unique 5′-untranslated sequence is that this unique 5′-extension exists upstream of the reported 2D4 gene (16Matsunaga E. Umeno M. Gonzalez F.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and is spliced to the 5′-end of the conserved protein encoding sequence. However, the alternative splicing hypothesis cannot explain the nucleotide differences in the C-terminal region. A CYP2D18-protein product expressed in COS-M6 cells showed both a cross-reacting band with anti-P-450 2D6 antibody and a significant catalytic activity toward imipramine N-demethylation. Inhibition studies of brain microsomal catalytic activity toward imipramine metabolism using quinidine, a subfamily 2D P-450 inhibitor, provide evidence that both hydroxylation and N-demethylation can be mediated by subfamily 2D P-450 or some other quinidine-inhibitable enzyme (29Sequeira D.J. Strobel H.W. Brain Res. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In order to elucidate these discrepancies, we are now expressing a protein product in Escherichia coli for large scale purification of this unique form of brain P-450. In summary, we have demonstrated that CYP2D18 cloned from a brain library is a unique member of the 2D P-450 subfamily expressed in rat brain and is a form distinct from CYP2D4 by genomic cloning. Moreover our data provide a basis for an explanation of the relation between gene structure and regulation of CYP2D18 in relation to CYP2D4. It is possible that CYP2D18 and CYP2D4 may have a tissue-specific distribution. The CYP2D18 protein product expressed in COS-M6 cells cross-reacts with anti-P-450 2D6 antibody, demonstrating its membership in the 2D subfamily, and shows a significant catalytic activity toward imipramine N-demethylation. This report constitutes the first direct evidence that a novel specific form of P-450 participates in the metabolism of tricyclic antidepressants in brain.

https://openalex.org/W2068776831,"Biliary glycoprotein (BGP), also known as C-CAM-1, has been shown to be down-regulated in colon and prostate tumors. Previously, we demonstrated that BGP mRNA is up-regulated by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in colon cancer cell lines (Takahashi, H., Okai, Y., Paxton, R. J., Hefta, L. J. F., and Shively, J. E.

Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) was identified as the ISRE-binding factor by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The induction of IRF-1 mRNA by IFN-γ in HT-29 cells reaches a maximum at 6 h and is superinduced by cycloheximide. Four mRNA species for BGP are induced by IFN-γ, the major band of which is inhibited by cycloheximide. Transfection of HT-29 cells with an IRF-1 expression plasmid (pAct-1) transactivates a BGP promoter reporter gene containing wild-type (but not mutant) ISRE. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis of a second footprint reveals the binding of Sp1, an Sp1-like protein, and upstream stimulatory factor. The Sp1-like complex was also induced by IFN-γ treatment of HT-29 cells and may be a second point of transcriptional control for the BGP gene. Biliary glycoprotein (BGP), also known as C-CAM-1, has been shown to be down-regulated in colon and prostate tumors. Previously, we demonstrated that BGP mRNA is up-regulated by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in colon cancer cell lines (Takahashi, H., Okai, Y., Paxton, R. J., Hefta, L. J. F., and Shively, J. E.

Connected by linker regions, E2 consists of two lipoyl domains, the NH2-lipoyl domain (L1) and the interior lipoyl domain (L2), and a pyruvate dehydrogenase component binding domain surrounding a 60-mer inner core. Using recombinant constructs of L1 or L2, E2-enhanced PDP activity was markedly decreased by L2 but not by L1, effectively competing with intact E2 in Ca2+-dependent binding of PDP (half-maximal reduction at 2.0 μM L2 versus 6.7 μM E2 subunit). Using L2 fused to glutathione S-transferase resulted in direct Ca2+-dependent binding of PDP to L2 (Kd, ∼1.7 μM L2). Affinity-bound glutathione S-transferase-L2 was used to purify PDP to homogeneity by selective binding and elution by Ca2+ chelation.The large activity enhancement of PDP by E2 was eliminated by enzymatic removal of lipoates from E2 and restored by their enzymatic reintroduction. The critical role of the L2 lipoate is not in binding of PDP to E2, since PDP was still bound by delipoylated L2, and delipoylated L2 inhibited E2-enhanced PDP activity, although lipoylated L2 was more effective in each of these tests. Thus, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity is increased by enhanced availability of PDP to its E2-bound, phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase substrate as a consequence of the Ca2+-facilitated interchange of PDP among the mobile L2 domains and an essential (undetermined) step engaging the L2 lipoate.

In most biological systems, the replication of DNA involves the coordinated actions of a multitude of different proteins. In general, as the complexity of the organism increases so do the number of proteins participating in DNA replication. The bacteriophage T4 DNA replication system is well suited for a mechanistic investigation of the protein-protein interactions required for replication due to the relatively low number of proteins involved and the apparent functional similarities to other more complicated systems such as those found in Escherichia coli and eucaryotes (reviewed in Refs. 1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 113-217Google Scholar and 2Stillman B. Cell. 1994; 78: 725-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The bacteriophage T4 replication fork is comprised of the DNA polymerase enzyme (the product of gene 43), the DNA polymerase accessory proteins (the 44/62 complex and the 45 protein), as well as the ssDNA-binding protein (the 32 protein), the helicase (the 41 protein), the primase (the 61 protein), and the helicase accessory protein (the 59 protein) (3Young M.C.

The T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme consists of the T4 polymerase, which possesses both a 5′-3′ polymerase and a 3′-5′ exonuclease activity, and the 45 protein. The homotrimeric 45 protein is the processivity factor for the polymerase, and its x-ray structure is now known to resemble the “sliding clamp” ring structure previously shown for the analogous proteins from E. coli (β-clamp) and eucaryotes (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) 1J.

The 44/62 complex has a functional and a limited sequence homology (7O'Donnell M. Onrust R. Dean F.B. Chen M. Hurwitz J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) to the γ complex clamp loader of E. coli (8Onrust R. Stukenberg P.T. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 22689-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligomeric stoichiometry of the 44/62 complex is four 44 subunits to one 62 subunit with the ATPase activity residing on each of the 44 subunits (10Rush J. Lin T.-C. Quinones M. Spicer E.K. Douglas I. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10943-10953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was quantitatively demonstrated that the 44/62 complex loads the 45 protein in a catalytic manner and also functions as a chaperone protein to ensure productive holoenzyme complex (11Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 149-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The amount of ATP consumed in the 44/62-dependent loading of the 45 protein onto primed DNA has recently been shown to be consistent with the hydrolyis of ATP at all four ATPase sites in the 44/62 complex (13Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9253-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Despite the wealth of information regarding the roles of the different T4 replication proteins in DNA synthesis, there remain a number of individual events or “microprocesses” for which mechanisms are undetermined. For example, by dividing the T4 replication activity into three processes, 1) the assembly of the holoenzyme, 2) the synthesis of DNA, and 3) the disassembly of the holoenzyme, it is evident that there exist events within each process that may be considered microprocesses. One such microprocess within the assembly of the holoenzyme concerns the development of the protein-protein interaction(s) between the 45 protein and the 44/62 complex that are required to load the 45 protein onto DNA. The mechanism by which the 44/62 complex loads the 45 protein onto DNA is not known. It is known that ATP hydrolysis is required for the stimulation of the T4 polymerize processivity by the accessory proteins (14Piperno J.R. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5174-5179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, ATP hydrolysis appears not to be necessary for a 44/62 complex-mediated 45 protein-DNA interaction since this interaction was observed with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS, 2The abbreviations used are: ATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(3-thiophosphate)biobiotinDCIA7-diethylamino-3-((4′-iodoacetyl)amino)phenyl)-4-methylcoumarinDTNB5,5′-dithio-bis(2,2′-nitrobenzoic acid)IAANS2-(4′-(iodoacetamido)anilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid, sodium saltIAEDANS5-((((iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acidIANBDN-((2-(iodoacetoxy)ethyl)-N-methyl)amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazoleIAF5-iodoacetamidofluorescein. by both DNA footprinting (15Munn M.M.

The investigation of the DNA loading mechanism of the 45 protein is made difficult by the fact that 45 protein does not possess a measurable intrinsic activity. It would therefore be advantageous to have a means of directly monitoring the 45 protein interactions during complex formation. adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiophosphate) biotin 7-diethylamino-3-((4′-iodoacetyl)amino)phenyl)-4-methylcoumarin 5,5′-dithio-bis(2,2′-nitrobenzoic acid) 2-(4′-(iodoacetamido)anilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid, sodium salt 5-((((iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid N-((2-(iodoacetoxy)ethyl)-N-methyl)amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein. In this paper, we describe a fluorescently labeled cysteine mutant of the 45 protein. It is demonstrated that this fluorescently labeled 45 protein provides a novel means for the direct investigation of certain 45 protein-protein interactions as well as 45 protein-DNA interactions. The observed fluorescence changes enabled the presentation of a partial mechanism for T4 holoenzyme assembly. The change in the fluorescence of the labeled 45 protein that occurs upon holoenzyme formation has also provided a new assay for the determination of the T4 holoenzyme-DNA complex dissociation rate constant. Oligonucleotides were synthesized with an Expedite 8909 DNA synthesizer (Perceptive Biosystems) and purified according to Capson et al. (18Capson T.L. Peliska J.A. Kaboord B.F. Frey M.W. Lively C. Dahlberg M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10984-10994Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Biotin-labeled oligonucleotides were prepared using a BioTEG phosphoramidite as obtained from Glen Research. The fluorescent probes DCIA, dibromobimane, IAEDANS, IANBD, IAF, IAANS, 2-(4′-(iodoacetamido)anilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid, sodium salt were obtained from Molecular Probes, and pyrene maleimide was obtained from Acros. ATPγS was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim as a 98% pure solution and used without further purification. DuPont NEN was the source of the [γ-32P]ATP used to 5′-end label oligonucleotides with T4 polynucleotide kinase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). All other biochemicals and chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Fisher and were of analytical grade or better. DNA encoding a threonine to cysteine mutation at position 7 in the 45 protein (T7C-45 protein) ligated into a pET 26b expression vector was a generous gift of Dr. John Kuriyan (Rockefeller University). Following transformation of the DNA into BL21-DE3 E. coli and IPTG-induced expression, the T7C-45 protein was purified according to Nossal (19Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6026-6031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild type 45 protein and the 44/62 complex were purified from overproducing strains obtained from Dr. William Konigsberg (Yale University) as described previously (19Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6026-6031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The T4 exonuclease-deficient polymerase D219A mutant was purified according to Frey et al. (20Frey M.W. Nossal N.G. Capson T.L. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2579-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The D219A mutant of the T4 polymerase was used in these studies to avoid complications arising from the presence of the exonuclease activity. The polymerase activity of the T4 D219A polymerase is identical to that of the wild type enzyme (20Frey M.W. Nossal N.G. Capson T.L. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2579-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The biotinylated 34/62/36-mer DNA substrate was constructed as described previously (12Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This DNA substrate is composed of a 34-mer primer annealed to a 3′-biotinylated 62-mer with a 36-mer fork strand annealed to the 5′-end of the template with an 18-base overhang. The modification of the cysteine thiol of the T7C-45 protein was performed upon passage of the protein solution over a G-25 column equilibrated with degassed buffer A (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM KOAc, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, pH 7.8) followed by the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of thiol reagent over protein monomer. The cysteine labeling reaction was allowed to proceed approximately 4 h at 4°C. Excess thiol reagent was removed by extensive dialysis against buffer B (50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0). The labeled protein solution was then concentrated in a microconcentrator (Centricon-30) and stored at −80°C. The extent of cysteine modification was quantitated by measuring the dye concentration from its molar extinction at a wavelength other than 280 nm. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay with the 45 protein as the standard. Labeling efficiencies are reported as mol of dye/mol of 45 trimer. Steady state ATP hydrolysis measurements were performed using a phosphoenolpyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase enzyme coupled system where the consumption of ATP was monitored spectrophotometrically (OLIS-Cary-14 spectrophotometer) upon oxidation of NADH (13Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9253-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ATPase activity was observed upon addition of the 45 protein (250 nM) to a solution containing 250 nM 44/62 complex, 250 nM biotinylated 34/62/36-mer DNA, 1 μM streptavidin, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 200 μM NADH, 6 units of phosphoenolpyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase mix, and buffer C (150 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, and 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5) at 25°C. The T4 D219A polymerase protein was subsequently added to observe the inhibition of the ATP hydrolysis upon stable complex formation. The effect of the mutation of the threonine at position 7 to a cysteine in the 45 protein (the T7C-45 protein) as well as the subsequent thiol derivatization of the T7C thiol on protein function was assessed by substitution for wild type, unlabeled 45 protein. Initial rates of ATP hydrolysis were obtained under conditions where less than 10% of the limiting reactant was utilized over the reaction time course. The pre-steady state ATPase rates were performed using a rapid quench instrument (21Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 677-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) as described previously (13Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9253-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ATPase rates were obtained from an assay mixture containing 250 nM 44/62 complex, 250 nM 45 protein (or labeled 45 protein), 500 nM biotinylated 34/62/36-mer DNA, 1 μM streptavidin, 1 mM ATP, 50 nM [γ-32P]ATP in buffer C at 25°C. Briefly, the reactions were quenched with 1 M HCl and neutralized with an appropriate amount of 3 M NaOH in 1 M Tris base followed by a thin layer chromatographic separation of [γ-32P]ATP from γ-32P and then radiochemical analysis using a Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager. A strand displacement assay was utilized to further characterize the effect of T7C-45 protein thiol modification on the formation of active holoenzyme. This assay has been described in detail elsewhere (12Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, an assay mixture containing 50 nM32P-5′-end-labeled, biotinylated 34/62/36-mer DNA, 55 nM streptavidin, 1 mM ATP, and 10 μM dCTP is preincubated 30 s with 10 nM T4 D219A polymerase, 55 nM 44/62 complex, 55 nM 45 protein before addition of 10 μM remaining deoxynucleotides (dATP, dTTP, and dGTP) and 1 mg/ml salmon sperm single strand DNA trap. Following the addition of the remaining dNTPs and single strand DNA trap, aliquots were removed at different times and quenched in 2 M HCl and extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The zero point was obtained by omitting the protein from the assay mixture. The omission of the remaining three nucleotides provided an experimental control to assess the incorporation extent of the first nucleotide. Prior to loading onto a 16% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea, sequencing gel, the samples were neutralized with the addition of an appropriate amount of 3 M NaOH in 1 M Tris-base. The sequencing gels were exposed to constant current electrophoresis, and the distribution of the radioactivity was analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager. Steady state fluorescence measurements were performed using an SLM Aminco 8000C photon counting spectrofluorometer equipped with a thermostated cell compartment that was maintained at 25°C. The experiments were performed in buffer C in the presence of an appropriate amount of T7C-45-ANBD protein to provide a satisfactory fluorescence signal (usually 250 nM). The effects of the other components of the T4 polymerase holoenzyme (i.e. proteins, DNA, and/or ATP) on the T7C-45-ANBD fluorescence were observed upon their direct addition to the fluorescence cuvette. The fluorescence spectra obtained were normalized for the effects of dilution. Stopped-flow fluorescence measurements were performed using an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow instrument at a constant temperature of 25°C. The changes in fluorescence were observed upon stopped-flow mixing of syringe A and syringe B. Syringe A contained 500 nM T7C-45-ANBD protein, 500 nM of the 44/62 complex, 1 mM ATP, 500 nM biotinylated 34/62/36-mer DNA, 500 nM T4 D219A polymerase, and 550 nM streptavidin in buffer C. Syringe B contained 20 mM glucose and 20 units/ml glucose hexokinase in buffer C. The concentration of protein and DNA in the two syringes of the stopped-flow instrument was diluted by a factor of 2 upon stopped-flow mixing. Data obtained from the pre-steady state rate of ATP hydrolysis by the 44/62 complex were fit to Equation 1: y=Ae−Bt+C(Eq. 1) where A is the amplitude of the pre-steady state phase, B is the pre-steady state rate constant, and C is a constant. Data obtained from the stopped-flow fluorescence determination of the kinetics of holoenzyme dissociation were best fit by Equation 2: y=Ae−Bt+Ct+D(Eq. 2) where A is the amplitude of the exponential decay, B is the exponential decay rate constant, C is a linear decay rate, and D is a constant. The wild type 45 protein is devoid of cysteine residues. The site-selective introduction of a cysteine residue into the sequence of the 45 protein enables the covalent attachment of a thiol-reactive fluorescent molecule at a known position in the primary structure. A mutated 45 protein, in which a threonine residue at position 7 from the N terminus, was site-specifically mutated to a cysteine residue producing the threonine 7 to cysteine 45 mutant protein (T7C-45 protein). The details for the creation of this cysteine mutant will be published elsewhere. 3The T7C-45 mutant protein was obtained from the Kuriyan Laboratory (Rockefeller University). The cysteine mutant, T7C-45 protein, was modified using several different thiol-reactive probes (Table I). The thiol quantitating reagent 5,5′-dithiobis(2,2′-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB; Ref. 22Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 82: 70-77Crossref Scopus (21624) Google Scholar) reacted slowly with three of the thiols in the trimer indicating the presence of only the reduced form of the cysteines. No evidence of nonequivalent cysteine thiols in the T7C-45 protein trimer was provided by the DTNB reactivity since the reaction was best approximated by a single exponential (data not shown). However, thiol modification of the cysteine T7C-45 protein with the majority of the fluorescent probes consistently led to a probe:trimer ratio less than 3:1, the ratio expected if all thiols in the trimer were modified (Table I). It is evident that for most of the probes tested in this study the probe:trimer ratio was close to 1:1 (omitting DTNB, the average probe:trimer ratio equals 1.2:1) which suggests that only one out of three of the cysteines in the trimer is modified. Of the fluorescent probes tested in Table I, dibromobimane incorporated to the greatest extent (2.3:1) while the naphthalene derivative (IAANS) was the least reactive (0.4:1). A titration of the remaining thiols of the T7C-45-ANBD protein with DTNB yielded 2 thiols per trimer, which was again consistent with a labeling efficiency for IANBD of only 1 probe:trimer.Table I.Thiol reagent labeling efficiency of the T7C-45 proteinThiol reagentProbe:trimeraThe labeling efficiency was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” where the concentration of each probe was determined using the following molar extinction coefficients: DCIA, 33,000 liter · cm · mol−1 at 382 nm; dibromobimane, 5,300 liter · cm · mol−1 at 397 nm; DTNB 13,600 liter · cm · mol−1 at 412 nm; IAANS, 26,000 liter · cm · mol−1 at 329 nm; IAEDANS, 5,700 liter · cm · mol−1 at 336 nm; IAF, 82,000 liter · cm · mol−1 at 491 nm; IANBD, 23,000 liter · cm · mol−1 at 472 nm and pyrenemaleimide, 36,000 liter · cm · mol−1 at 339 nm.mol/molDCIA0.6Dibromobimane2.3DTNB3IAANS0.4IAEDANS1.3IAF1.5IANBD0.9Pyrene maleimide1.2a The labeling efficiency was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” where the concentration of each probe was determined using the following molar extinction coefficients: DCIA, 33,000 liter · cm · mol−1 at 382 nm; dibromobimane, 5,300 liter · cm · mol−1 at 397 nm; DTNB 13,600 liter · cm · mol−1 at 412 nm; IAANS, 26,000 liter · cm · mol−1 at 329 nm; IAEDANS, 5,700 liter · cm · mol−1 at 336 nm; IAF, 82,000 liter · cm · mol−1 at 491 nm; IANBD, 23,000 liter · cm · mol−1 at 472 nm and pyrenemaleimide, 36,000 liter · cm · mol−1 at 339 nm. Open table in a new tab The measurement of the degree of stimulation of the 44/62 complex steady state ATPase activity by the fluorescently labeled T7C-45 proteins provides a convenient assay to assess the effects of derivatization on 45 protein function (Table II). ATP is consumed as the 44/62 complex loads the 45 protein onto the biotinylated 34/62/36 DNA substrate. In the absence of the T4 polymerase, the 45 protein dissociates from DNA allowing it to be reloaded by the 44/62 complex at the expense of additional ATP hydrolysis. The addition of the T4 polymerase diminishes ATP consumption through the formation of holoenzyme, which is more stable on DNA than the 45 protein alone (13Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9253-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, the T7C-45 mutant displays essentially identical activity to that of the wild type 45 protein. Labeling the T7C-45 protein with iodoacetamidofluorescein (IAF) led to a decrease in the observed stimulation of the ATPase activity of the 44/62 complex (Table II). The modification of the T7C-45 protein with IANBD, however, did not affect its ability to stimulate the 44/62 complex steady state ATPase activity (Table II).Table II.Stimulation of the DNA-dependent 44/62 complex ATPase activity by fluorescently labeled 45 proteins45 proteinSteady state rate 1aSteady state ATPase activity was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Steady state rate 1 corresponds to the ATPase rate resulting from the stimulation by the 45 protein, and steady state rate 2 is the rate observed upon addition of the D219A T4 polymerase to the solution that contains the 45 protein.

Open table in a new tab A rapid chemical quench method has been developed to measure the pre-steady state kinetics of ATP hydrolysis by the 44/62 complex (13Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9253-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ability of the T7C-45-ANBD protein to substitute for the wild type 45 protein under pre-steady state conditions was also assessed (Table II). No significant difference was observed between the T7C-45-ANBD protein and the wild type 45 protein with respect to the measured pre-steady state rates and the burst amplitudes (Table II). The pre-steady state ATPase rate is determined by the chemical rate of ATP hydrolysis rather than product release (steady state rate). The burst amplitude relative to the 44/62 complex concentration provides the stoichiometry of ATP consumption. At a concentration of 250 nM the burst amplitude for both forms of the 45 protein was approximately 1 μM which corresponds to 4 mol of ATP hydrolyzed per mol of 44/62 complex as previously reported (13Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9253-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To further examine the effect of the T7C mutation and subsequent thiol derivatization of the 45 protein on holoenzyme function, a strand displacement assay was utilized. In this assay the fork strand (36-mer) of a 5′-32P-biotinylated 62/34/36-mer is capable of being displaced by the holoenzyme but not by the T4 polymerase alone (11Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 149-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Displacement of the fork strand gives rise to the production of a fully extended 62-mer primer strand that can be differentiated from the bio62-mer template strand on a polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Quantitation of the radioactivity of the 62-mer primer strand yields a measure of the ability of the T4 replicative proteins to form productive holoenzyme complex. Fig. 1 demonstrates that the T7C-45 mutant protein displays strand displacement activity comparable with the wild type 45 protein even when derivatized with IANBD. The T7C-45-ANBD protein was selected for further study based on two important properties. First, the ability of the T7C-45-ANBD protein to substitute for the wild type 45 protein in the assays described above, without a measurable loss of activity (Table II and Fig. 1), makes this labeled 45 protein potentially suitable for monitoring the interactions of the 45 protein at the T4 replication fork. Second, the environmentally sensitive nature of T7C-45-ANBD has been shown to permit the detection of certain 45 protein-44/62 complex and 45 protein-DNA interactions (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2, the addition of the 44/62 complex to a solution of the T7C-45-ANBD protein resulted in no measurable change in the fluorescence emission spectrum. The subsequent addition of ATP to the above solution containing T7C-45-ANBD and 44/62 complex caused a marked (approximately 1.7-fold) increase in the fluorescence intensity. In the absence of the 44/62 complex ATP had no effect on the fluorescence of the T7C-45-ANBD protein (data not shown). That fluorescence increase was then attenuated by the addition of the bio34/62/36-mer to an intermediate level of fluorescent intensity approximately 1.3 times greater than that of the T7C-45-ANBD alone. The fluorescence of the T7C-45-ANBD protein is insensitive to the addition of the T4 polymerase whether it is added to the mixture of T7C-45-ANBD protein, 44/62 complex, and DNA (Fig. 2) or in any other order of addition (data not shown). A demonstration of whether or not ATP hydrolysis is required for a particular biochemical event is often made possible by testing the ability of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs to substitute for ATP. ATPγS has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the 44/62 complex ATPase activity, whereas the ATP analogs AMP-PNP and AMP-PCP are much weaker inhibitors (14Piperno J.R. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5174-5179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4A. J. Berdis, unpublished data. The ATP analogs, AMP-PNP and AMP-PCP, did not produce any change in the fluorescence of the T7C-45-ANBD protein under the above experimental conditions and at a concentration of up to 10 mM"

INTRODUCTIONHuman fibrinogen is a plasma glycoprotein that participates in the final phase of blood coagulation. It is composed of two sets of three polypeptides, designated α, β, and γ with molecular masses of 66, 52, and 46 kDa, respectively (McKee et al., 18McKee P.A. Rogers L.A. Marler E. Hill R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 116: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The six chains, (αβγ)2, are linked by 29 interchain and intrachain disulfide bonds to form a trinodular structure (340 kDa) as seen in the electron microscope (Hall and Slayter, 9Hall C.E. Slayter H.S. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1959; 5: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The central nodule contains the amino termini of all six polypeptide chains, whereas the two outer nodules contain the carboxyl termini of the β and γ chains (Norton and Slayter, 21Norton P. Slayter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1661-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar; Weisel et al., 27Weisel J.W. Stauffacher C.V. Bullit E. Cohen C. Science. 1985; 230: 1388-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The outer nodules can be subdivided into two closely positioned globular domains formed by the independent folding of the β and γ chains (Rao et al., 22Rao S.P.S. Poojary M.D. Elliott B.W. Melanson L.A. Oriel B. Cohen C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of the α chain folds into a compact domain that folds back toward the middle of the molecule where it interacts with the central nodule (Veklich et al., 26Veklich Y.I. Gorkun O.V. Medved L.V. Nieuwenhuizen W. Weisel J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13577-13585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three nodules of fibrinogen are connected by coiled-coils composed of two triple-stranded helices involving 110 or 111 amino acids (Doolittle et al., 6Doolittle R.F. Goldbaum D.M. Doolittle L.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).Several pathways of fibrinogen assembly have been proposed (Roy et al., 23Roy S.N. Procyk R. Kudryk B.J. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4758-4763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Hartwig and Danishefsky, 10Hartwig R. Danishefsky K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6578-6585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory employing stably transfected baby hamster kidney (BHK) 1The abbreviations used are: BHKbaby hamster kidneyBiPimmunoglobulin heavy chain-binding proteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. cells showed that the initial assembly of fibrinogen involves the formation of αγ and βγ heterodimers, but not αβ heterodimers (Huang et al., 15Huang S. Mulvihill E.R. Farrell D.H. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8919-8926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of a third chain leads to the formation of half-molecules (αβγ), which then dimerize to form the mature six-chain fibrinogen, (αβγ)2, that circulates in blood.The three genes coding for the α, β, and γ chains of human fibrinogen are located on chromosome 4 in about 50 kilobase pairs of DNA (Henry et al., 11Henry I. Uzan G. Weil D. Nicolas H. Kaplan J.C. Marguerie C. Kahn A. Junien C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1984; 36: 760-768PubMed Google Scholar). They are arranged in the order of γ, α, and β and contain a number of introns (four, seven, and nine introns, respectively) that may serve in part to delineate functional domains in the protein (Chung et al., 2Chung D.W. Harris J.E. Davie E.W. Liu C.Y. Chien S. Fibrinogen, Thrombin, Coagulation, Fibrinolysis. Plenum Press, New York1990: 39-48Google Scholar; Kant et al., 17Kant J.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Saxe D. Simon M.I. McBride O.W. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2344-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The three genes for human fibrinogen also contain a number of conserved introns, including one located in the middle of the coiled-coil domain in each of the chains (α103-104, β133-134, and γ76-77) (Medved, 19Medved L.V. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1990; 1: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The location of this intron also coincides with plasmin-sensitive sites in each of the three chains, and corresponds to a region in the triple-stranded helix that can accommodate a significant deviation from a perfect triple-stranded coil (Doolittle et al., 6Doolittle R.F. Goldbaum D.M. Doolittle L.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It seems possible that the location of this intron may also serve to delineate sequences in the fibrinogen chains that are necessary for the assembly of the three chains.In the present study, various combinations of chimeric fibrinogen chains (α/β, α/γ, β/α, β/γ, γ/α, and γ/β) were constructed using this intron position as the crossover point in order to assess the contribution of the amino terminus and the first half of the coiled-coil region of each chain in the assembly process.DISCUSSIONDuring the synthesis of fibrinogen, the individual α, β, and γ chains are translated, processed, assembled, and eventually secreted into plasma as a six-chain mature fibrinogen molecule. Only very small amounts of partially assembled intermediates, primarily αγ, and αβγ half-molecules, however, are secreted during this process. The synthesis and assembly of fibrinogen has been shown in BHK cells (Farrell et al., 7Farrell D.H. Mulvihill E.R. Huang S. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9414-9420Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), COS-1 cells (Roy et al., 23Roy S.N. Procyk R. Kudryk B.J. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4758-4763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Hartwig and Danishefsky, 10Hartwig R. Danishefsky K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6578-6585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and most recently in yeast (Roy et al., 24Roy S.N. Kudryk B. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23761-23767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), indicating that the assembly process does not require hepatocyte-specific factors. Transient association of the chaperon protein BiP with partially assembled intermediates have been observed in HepG2, BHK, as well as COS-1 cells. Current evidence support a model that the assembly of fibrinogen from its constituent chains follows a stepwise chain addition pathway, although the order of chain addition remains controversial. In one proposal, αβ and βγ complexes were functional intermediates in this process (Roy et al., 23Roy S.N. Procyk R. Kudryk B.J. Redman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4758-4763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, studies in BHK cells (Huang et al., 15Huang S. Mulvihill E.R. Farrell D.H. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8919-8926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and results presented here support the model that only αγ or βγ complexes, but not the αβ complex, are functional intermediates in this process. The preferential formation of these heterodimeric complexes suggests that this specific sequence of chain additions is determined by the inherent amino acid sequences in the fibrinogen chains.Studies described in this report further identify that the amino acid sequences involved are located in the second half of the coiled-coil domain of the fibrinogen chains. Coiled-coil sequences may adopt a dimeric, trimeric, or an anti-parallel tetrameric conformation, all of which can be accommodated in the “knobs-into-hole” packing model proposed by Crick (5Crick F.H.C. Acta Cryst. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar). According to this model, the side chains (knobs) at positions a and d of one heptad repeat fit into the spaces (holes) between four amino acid residues in a neighboring helix. For two-stranded coiled-coils, β-branched (Ile and Val) are conserved at positions a, while Leu residues are conserved at positions d, whereas for three-stranded coiled-coils, Leu and β-branched amino acids are equally represented in the a and d positions (Conway and Parry, 4Conway J.F. Parry D.A.D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 14-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). An examination of the hydrophobic amino acids in the second half of the coiled-coil domain of the three fibrinogen chains shows that Ile and Val residues are found predominantly in the a positions and Leu residues are exclusively located at d positions of the heptad repeats. This distribution favors initial two-stranded coiled-coil interactions and is consistent with the model that these regions initiate chain-specific interactions to give rise to an initial intermediate with two-stranded coiled-coils. Furthermore, an examination of the distribution of hydrophobic amino acids in the first half of the coiled-coil region shows that Leu and β-branched amino acids (Ile and Val) are evenly distributed in positions a and d of the heptad repeats, representing a distribution that would favor three-stranded coiled-coil formation. This distribution is also consistent with our interpretation that sequences in the first half of the coiled-coil regions participate in a later step in the assembly process, and the formation of the three-stranded coiled-coils can only occur after the initial two-stranded coiled-coils are formed. These data are also consistent with the model that hydrophobic interactions provide the driving force for the initial assembly process as first proposed by Doolittle (Doolittle et al., 6Doolittle R.F. Goldbaum D.M. Doolittle L.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutations in hydrophilic residues have no effect on the assembly process. These hydrophilic interactions may serve to further stabilize the two-stranded coiled-coil after it is formed but are insufficient to bring about the formation of the coiled-coil itself.The chain-specific ordered assembly process reflects the result of evolutionary selection that parallels the development of other functions in the molecule. The similarity in sequence of the three chains indicates that the three genes evolved from a common ancestor. Before the divergence into multiple chains, the polypeptide from the single primordial gene presumably assembles randomly to form homotrimeric half-molecules and six-chain molecules. After the gene has duplicated and the individual duplicated genes evolve to acquire distinct functions, e.g. polymerization sites, cross-linking sites, and platelet binding sites, a necessity arose that the constituent chains assemble non-randomly in a chain-specific manner to ensure that the assembled molecule would possess the necessary functional characteristics. Therefore, the selective pressures during evolution have preserved changes in the coiled-coil regions that favor heterodimeric over homodimeric interactions. These changes are not represented in the linear sequence, but in the conservation of hydrophobic amino acids and their distribution, the distribution of β-branched amino acids, the location of disulfide bonds, and the length of the coiled-coil domains.

It is composed of two sets of three polypeptides, designated α, β, and γ with molecular masses of 66, 52, and 46 kDa, respectively (McKee et al., 18McKee P.A. Rogers L.A. Marler E. Hill R.L. Arch.

https://openalex.org/W2129345907,"Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) require heterodimerization with retinoid X receptor (RXR) for maximum DNA binding affinity. Interaction with RXR occurs via two dimerization interfaces, one in the DNA-binding domain and one in the C-terminal ""ninth heptad"" of the receptors. We studied the relative importance of these two dimerization domains in naturally occurring C-terminal TR variants. TRα1 has a conserved ninth heptad and formed stable heterodimers with RXR in solution. TRα1·RXR heterodimers bound similarly to direct repeat 4 (DR4) sites with different 5′-flanking and spacer sequences. In contrast, TRα2, which contains a highly divergent ninth heptad, did not interact with RXR in solution and bound as a heterodimer with RXR only to specific DR4 sequences in which the downstream half-site was the preferred octameric binding site of TR (TNAGGTCA). Although the ninth heptad of TRα2 was insufficient for interaction with RXR off DNA, this region was required for DNA-dependent heterodimerization with RXR. TRα3, another naturally occurring TRα isoform whose ninth heptad differs from those of both TRα1 and TRα2, displayed intermediate behavior in heterodimerization with RXR. Thus, in the absence of a strong ninth heptad interaction an octameric downstream half-site allosterically promotes RXR heterodimerization with TRα2. Differential dependence upon DNA-binding for heterodimerization with RXR may influence transcriptional regulation by TRα isoforms."

The three modified cysteine residues were identified as Cys<sup>113</sup>, Cys<sup>195</sup>, and Cys<sup>421</sup>, respectively, by protein sequencing after modification with [1-<sup>14</sup>C]iodoacetamide.

To verify whether some of these cysteine residues are important for the enzyme catalysis, these three cysteine residues were replaced by either serine or aspartic acid using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutants of both Cys<sup>113</sup> (C113S and C113D) and Cys<sup>421</sup> (C421S and C421D) had enzyme activities similar to that of the wild-type enzyme, and only slight changes were observed in the steady-state kinetics measured in both the synthetic and hydrolytic directions. However, mutants of Cys<sup>195</sup> (C195D and C195S) displayed drastically reduced enzyme activities, and <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> values were only 7 and 12% of that of the wild-type enzyme, respectively, resulting in a calculated loss in binding energy (ΔΔ<i>G</i>) of approximate 1 Kcal/mol. The Cys<sup>195</sup> mutants were capable of catalyzing both the 3′-oxidative and 5′-hydrolytic reactions, as evidenced by the reduction of <i>E</i>·NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH and formation of the 5′-hydrolytic product when incubated with (<i>E</i>)-5′,6′-didehydro-6′-deoxy-6′-chlorohomoadenosine at rates comparable with those catalyzed by the wild-type enzyme. However, mutations of the Cys<sup>195</sup> severely altered the 3′-reduction potential as evidenced by the drastic reduction in the rate of [2,8-<sup>3</sup>H]Ado release from the <i>E</i><sup>−NADH</sup>·[2,8-<sup>3</sup>H]3′-keto-Ado complex. Circular dichroism studies of the Cys<sup>195</sup> mutants confirmed that the observed effects are not due to changes in secondary structure. These results suggested that the Cys<sup>195</sup> is involved in the catalytic center and may play an important role in maintaining the 3′-reduction potential for effective release of the reaction products and regeneration of the active form (NAD<sup>+</sup> form) of the enzyme; the Cys<sup>113</sup> is located in or near the substrate binding site, but plays no role beneficial to the catalysis; and the Cys<sup>421</sup> is a nonessential residue, which also explains why Cys<sup>421</sup> does not occur in any other known AdoHcy hydrolases."

Here we show that PTHrP and the PTH/PTHrP receptor are products of cerebellar granule cells in primary culture. Granule cells maintained under depolarizing conditions (25 mM K+) make and release PTHrP. Further, PTHrP-(1-36) stimulates cAMP accumulation in granule neurons in a dose-dependent manner with half-maximal activation at ∼16 nM. Granule cell PTHrP mRNA is activity-dependent, and the pathway of regulation depends absolutely on the flux of Ca2+ ions through the L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel and the Ca2+/calmodulin kinase cascade. PTHrP is therefore a neuropeptide whose regulation depends upon L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel activity, and the gene is expressed under conditions that promote granule cell survival.

Nissenson R.A. West. J. Med. 1990; 153: 635-640PubMed Google Scholar, 2Martin T.J. Q. J. Med. 1990; 76: 771-786PubMed Google Scholar, 3Broadus A.E. Stewart A.F. The Parathyroids. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar). In this circumstance, PTHrP is elaborated by tumors in a sufficient quantity to cross-react with the classical PTH receptor in bone and kidney, resulting in the prototypical biochemical and clinical features of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. It is now known that the PTH and PTHrP genes arose by duplication and are two members of a small gene family (3Broadus A.E. Stewart A.F. The Parathyroids. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar). What remains from this common origin is a similar intron/exon organization and a short stretch of highly homologous sequence at the N terminus of each mature peptide. These N-terminal sequences appear to share a single G protein-coupled receptor, the PTH/PTHrP receptor (4Jüppner H. About-Samra B. Freeman M. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Richards J. Kolakowski L.F. Hock J. Potts J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Science. 1991; 254: 1024-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). This is an interesting and unusual example of ligand-receptor coupling, because the functions of PTH and PTHrP appear to be so remarkably different (3Broadus A.E. Stewart A.F. The Parathyroids. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar). PTH has a highly restricted pattern of expression and functions as a classical systemic peptide hormone that is charged with maintaining the serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations within the physiological range. In contrast, the PTHrP gene is expressed in a wide variety of normal tissues and cell types and appears to function in an autocrine/paracrine fashion (3Broadus A.E. Stewart A.F. The Parathyroids. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar). The PTH/PTHrP receptor is also widely expressed, often in a hand-in-glove pattern by cells immediately adjacent to sites of PTHrP expression, another point favoring autocrine/paracrine function (5Lee K. Deeds J.D. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 453-463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as presently envisioned, the specificity of signaling of this small peptide family is entirely a function of the spatial and temporal expression of the two ligands and their shared receptor. PTHrP appears to be subject to multiple posttranslational processing steps that could generate additional products, but receptors for these peptides have not been identified (3Broadus A.E. Stewart A.F. The Parathyroids. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar).

PTHrP is as widely expressed in fetal as it is in adult tissues, and a number of recent experiments in mice indicate that PTHrP functions as a developmental regulatory molecule. For example, targeted disruption of the murine PTHrP gene results in a form of lethal chondrodysplasia that seems to reflect an accelerated program of chondrocyte differentiation (6Karaplis A.C. Luz A. Glowacki J. Bronson R.T. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Kronenberg H.M. Mulligan R.C. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar), whereas targeted overexpression of PTHrP to skin and breast results in a delay/failure of developmental programs in these tissues (7Wysolmerski J.J.

Daifotis A.G. Broadus A.E. Philbrick W.M. Development. 1995; 121: 3539-3547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PTHrP also has been implicated in a number of local regulatory systems in adult tissues, including excitable tissues like smooth muscle. PTHrP is uniformly expressed in smooth muscle throughout the organism, and in a number of these sites the gene has been found to be induced by mechanical stretch (3Broadus A.E. Stewart A.F. The Parathyroids. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar, 9Daifotis A.G. Weir E.C. Dreyer B.E. Broadus A.E. J. Biol.

Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar). The functional significance of these findings is most easily appreciated in expandable tissues such as the uterus, bladder, and chicken oviduct shell gland, in which a stretch-induced relaxant would allow accommodation of mechanical filling or occupancy (9Daifotis A.G.

PTHrP and the PTH/PTHrP receptor have been identified in discrete neuronal populations in the central nervous system, but there is as yet very limited information as to the regulation of PTHrP gene expression or potential PTHrP effects at these sites (3Broadus A.E. Stewart A.F. The Parathyroids. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar, 12Weaver D.R. Deeds J.D. Lee K. Segre G.V. Mol.

A. 1990; 87: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Here, we report that both PTHrP and its receptor are expressed in primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule cells. PTHrP gene expression in these cells is activity-dependent and is controlled by depolarization-induced calcium entry via the L-type voltage sensitive Ca2+ channel acting through a Ca2+/calmodulin kinase pathway. Primary cultures of granule neurons about 90% pure were prepared from postnatal day eight (P8) rat cerebella by established methods (14Schousboe A. Meier E. Drejer J. Hertz L. Shahar A. A Dissection and Tissue Culture Manual of the Nervous System. Alan R. Liss, New York1989: 203-206Google Scholar). Timed pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats or timed Sprague-Dawley litters were obtained from Charles River Breeders (Raleigh, NC). Rats were maintained in the Yale Division of Animal Care facilities on a standard diet of rat chow and water ad lib and a 12-h light-dark cycle. P8 rat pups were sacrificed by decapitation, and cerebella were quickly removed, dissected free of meninges and blood vessels, and placed in ice-cold Krebs' buffer (120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.3 mM glucose, 25 mM NaHCO3, 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). After each cerebellum was collected, tissue was gently triturated (10 cycles with a Pasteur pipette) and then further dissociated by a two-step process using trypsin (0.3 mg/ml) for 15 min at 37°C, followed by deoxyribonuclease I (40 μg/ml) with soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.3 mg/ml). The resulting cell suspension was then washed in culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.5% glucose, 2 mML-glutamine, and KCl added to reach a final concentration of 25 mM). Cells were plated at a density of 7-8 × 105/cm2 onto plastic Petri dishes coated with 10 μg/ml poly-D-lysine. For immunofluorescence analyses, cells were cultured at the same density but upon eight-well glass slides (Nunc) coated with 50 μg/ml poly-D-lysine, which was found to be necessary for reliable cell adherence. Cultures were maintained in a standard 37°C humidified incubator at 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide. Cells were studied at 8-12 DIV. Experiments were either carried out in culture medium or, in cases where certain media components were to be left out, in synthetic, serum-free medium with the same ionic makeup of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1.8 mM CaCl2, 25 mM KCl, 1.6 mM MgSO4, 110 mM NaCl, 0.78 mM Na2HPO4, 3.3 mM glucose, 3.6 mML-glutamine, 4.4 mM NaHCO3). In the synthetic medium, ionic strength was maintained constant when KCl concentration was changed by use of choline chloride. We evaluated several established techniques such as the Percoll cushion method (15Hatten M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 384-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) or trypsinizing and replating mature cultures and found that these procedures did not reliably produce separations of neurons and glia of high purity. We therefore used glutamate exposure to differentially kill granule cells but spare glia in 8-day-old cultures (16de Erausquin G.A. Manev H. Guidotti A. Costa E. Brooker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mature cultures (8 DIV) were washed three times in synthetic medium with 5 mM K+ (5K) without added Mg2+, since magnesium is known to block the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channel (17Carter C.J. Noel F. Scatton B. Neurosci. Lett. 1987; 82: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and by this action protect neurons from the toxic effects of glutamate (16de Erausquin G.A. Manev H. Guidotti A. Costa E. Brooker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cells were then treated in the same synthetic media with 100 mM glutamate added for 1 h at room temperature. These conditions are somewhat more stringent than those used previously by de Erausquin et al. (16de Erausquin G.A. Manev H. Guidotti A. Costa E. Brooker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), where the cells were treated for 15 min with 50 mM glutamate, but these investigators employed a higher concentration of Ca2+ in their treatment medium (2.3 mM versus 1.8 mM). After the toxic exposure, cultures were washed twice in synthetic medium and returned to culture-conditioned medium in the incubator for an additional 24 h. After this time, loss of neurons was confirmed by direct observation under phase microscopy as well as by immunofluorescence analysis as described below, and sister cultures were harvested for RNA. Medium (25 mM K+) conditioned for 6 h by cells after 8 DIV was assayed for PTHrP content using an immunoradiometric assay for PTHrP-(1-74) with a sensitivity of 1 pM (18Burtis W.J. Brady T.G. Orloff J.J. Ersbak J.B. Warrell R.P. Olson B.R. Wu T.L. Mitnick M.E. Broadus A.E. Stewart A.J. N. Eng. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1106-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Media were collected in duplicate from three different primary cultures, and results were expressed as a function of cell protein content using the Bradford assay (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on eight-well glass slides as described above and subsequently fixed for 45 min in 2% paraformaldehyde, 75 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After three 5-min washes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.8% (w/v) NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) KCl, 0.115% (w/v) Na2HPO4, 0.02% (w/v) KH2PO4) with 0.2% BSA (PBS-BSA), cells to be stained for glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) or PTHrP were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Eastman Kodak Co.) in PBS. Cells were then washed three more times in PBS-BSA and blocked with 100% normal goat serum for 20 min at room temperature. Optimal antibody concentrations were established by conventional dilutional analysis. Rabbit polyclonal antineuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) was used at 1:400, and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP (Chemicon) was used at 1:2500. These antibodies were diluted in PBS-BSA with 5% normal goat serum. Incubations were carried out in a humidified box at 4°C for 24 h. To examine for PTHrP immunoreactivity, cultures were pretreated with colchicine (0.1 μg/ml) for 7 h. A 1:1000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-human PTHrP-(1-34) was used (Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA); PTHrP-(1-34) has the same amino acid sequence in rats and humans (20Karaplis A.C. Yasuda T. Hendy G.N. Goltzmann D. Banville D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Suva L.J. Winslow G.A. Wettenhall R.E.H. Hammonds R.G. Moseley J.M.

After incubation, slides were washed four times in PBS-BSA prior to the addition of the secondary antibody, which consisted of a 1:400 dilution of a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon) that was added to slides for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three washes in PBS-BSA and a final PBS rinse. Coverslips were mounted with SlowFade Light (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and slides were viewed using an epifluorescent microscope (Olympus BX50 with BXFCA attachment). RNA was prepared, and RNase protection analysis was carried out as described (13Weir E.C. Brines M.L. Ikeda K. Burtis W.J. Broadus A.E. Robbins R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1239-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) using RNA probes prepared from a 343-base pair PvuII-BglI rat PTHrP cDNA fragment, a 230-base pair Sau3A-BamHI rat cyclophilin cDNA fragment, and a 259-base pair fragment of the rat PTH/PTHrP receptor DNA. Cyclophilin was added as a loading control in each assay using a probe prepared with a reduced specific activity because of the high relative abundance of cyclophilin mRNA (22Holt E.H. Lu C. Dreyer B.E. Dannies P.S. Broadus A.E. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1239-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Each sample was assessed using 20 μg of total RNA. To minimize PTHrP in the media prior to the assay, cultures (8 DIV) were preincubated in 5K medium for 1.5 h and then switched to fresh 5K medium for another 1.5 h. After the 3-h preincubation, cells were changed to synthetic 5K medium with 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, placed in the incubator for 10 min, and then switched to synthetic 5K medium with 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine and PTHrP-(1-36) at concentrations from 10−11 to 10−6M in duplicate for another 5 min. At the end of the incubation, the medium was aspirated and replaced with ice-cold n-propanol. Cells in n-propanol were stored at −70°C overnight prior to collection of supernatants for cAMP assay. n-Propanol supernatants were dried under vacuum and assayed for cAMP using a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit (Biomedical Technologies, Inc., Stoughton, MA). Results were normalized to the total protein in each plate as measured by Bradford assay. The PTHrP-cAMP dose response was estimated by use of nonlinear least squares analysis (Deltagraph Pro 3.5; DeltaPoint, Inc.) using the Michaelis-Menten equation of enzyme kinetics describing a rectangular hyperbola. Forskolin (5-50 μM) was also used to stimulate cAMP, which peaked at ∼900 pmol/mg of protein under these conditions. This finding compares well with the 1000 pmol/mg of protein reported by Wroblewska et al. (23Wroblewska B. Wroblewski J. Saab O. Neale J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 943-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) using 30-100 μM forskolin in this culture model. A 45Ca flux assay was used to provide information about intracellular Ca2+ flux and was a modification of previously published methods (24Brass, L. F., Belmonte, E., Methods Enzymol., 169, 371–385.Google Scholar, 25Didier M. Héaulme M. Gonalons N. Soubrié P. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 244: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells in culture were subjected to a 3-h preincubation in 5K culture medium, and experimental incubations were carried out in the appropriate synthetic medium. Studies were performed using 35-mm2 dishes of cells in triplicate unless otherwise noted. After preincubation, the supernatant was aspirated and replaced with synthetic medium, which had been equilibrated for at least 3 h in a 37°C incubation. Dishes were placed on a 37°C warming tray during all manipulations outside the incubator and then were returned to the incubator for the designated time period. In order to preserve any factors that might have been released into the medium during the incubation and to minimize trauma to the cells, 45Ca was added by quickly aspirating the medium from each plate and mixing it in a microcentrifuge tube with an aliquot of 0.5 mCi of 45Ca (445 mCi/mmol, Amersham) diluted in synthetic medium such that the aliquot composed 5% of the final volume. This mixture was then gently returned to the plate, and the cells were replaced in the incubator. For the assay, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were rapidly washed four times with ice-cold wash buffer (5.4 mM KCl, 1.6 mM MgSO4, 3.3 mM glucose, 0.5 mM EGTA, 154 mM choline chloride at pH 7.4) and flooded with 500 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid for 45 min. Duplicate aliquots of supernatant (100 μl) were added to vials containing 4 ml of aqueous scintillation fluid (Optifluor; Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT) and counted for 10 min each in a liquid scintillation counter. Results from duplicate tubes were averaged, and the background counts were subtracted. A pilot study demonstrated that 45Ca uptake varied linearly with incubation time over the 2-20 min examined (data not shown). We selected for use a 10-min incubation, as have others using this model system (25Didier M. Héaulme M. Gonalons N. Soubrié P. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 244: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Results were corrected for decay of the isotope and normalized for total protein in each plate, as determined by Bradford assay, to allow for direct comparison of experiments. To assess L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channel (L-VSCC) flux, the specific antagonist nitrendipine (NTR) was employed. Micromolar concentrations of NTR are nonspecific, since ≥10−7M has been shown to inhibit 45Ca flux through NMDA receptor-evoked single channel activity in excised outside-out patches of mouse cerebellar granule cells (26Skeen G.A. Twyman R.E. White H.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 443-450PubMed Google Scholar), and ≥10−6M NTR has been reported to directly block Na+ channels (27Yatani A. Brown A.M. Circ. Res. 1985; 57: 868-875Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In our experiments, NTR concentrations of 10−10 to 10−8M appeared equivalent, inhibiting 25K-stimulated 45Ca flux by about 20% (from 117 ± 7 to 92 ± 6 pmol of 45Ca/mg of protein/10 min). We therefore selected 10−9M to define L-VSCC flux. To allow adequate time for equilibration, NTR was added 15 min before 45Ca. Nitrendipine was a generous gift of Dr. Howard Rasmussen (Medical College of Georgia). Bay K-8644, veratridine, monensin, KN-62, calmidazolium, forskolin, NMDA, and W-7 were obtained from Research Biochemicals, International (Natick, MA). All other reagents not specified were obtained from Sigma. Stock solutions of some reagents with poor aqueous solubility were made in ethanol at 1000 × final concentrations unless otherwise noted. An equal volume of vehicle was added in each case to control samples as well. In order to compare each experimental point with every other, results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Significance was determined by Fisher's protected test of least significant difference with a 95% confidence interval. Data were expressed ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using Statview II (Abacus Concepts). At 8 DIV the cerebellar granule cell cultures (Fig. 1, top panel) were populated by clusters of uniform, small neurons interconnected by fine processes overlying a bed of confluent, flat glia. The neurons were NCAM-positive, and the glia were GFAP-positive (data not shown). Examination of total RNA obtained from cells grown under 25 mM K+ (25K) conditions using RNase protection analysis confirmed that transcripts for both PTHrP and its receptor were present (Fig. 2, top lane). Immunofluorescent anti-PTHrP staining of colchicine-pretreated cultures was primarily localized to the somata of the granule neurons and, to a lesser extent, the interconnecting delicate processes (Fig. 1, bottom panel). Solitary bright neurons were occasionally visualized on the substrate outside of the aggregates, whereas only faint background, uninhibitable fluorescence was localized to the glial cells underlying the neuronal clusters. After cultures were pretreated with glutamate to deplete neurons and examined 24 h later, the neuronal clusters and associated processes were completely disrupted (data not shown). RNA analysis showed that in these neuron-depleted (glial-enriched) cultures, PTHrP mRNA, as well as that of its receptor, was eliminated (Fig. 2, bottom lane).Fig. 2mRNA for PTHrP and its receptor are neuronal products. RNase protection analysis is shown of RNA isolated from untreated cultures (Control lane) or cultures 24 h after glutamate treatment (Neuron-Depleted lane).

PTHrP was detected at concentrations of 2.5-6.0 pM (0.6-1.3 (± 0.1) fmol/mg of protein; limit of detection 1 pM). Medium from 4 mM K+ (“choline control”) possessed undetectable levels of PTHrP, as did glia-enriched cultures. These granule cell cultures also produced cAMP in response to exposure to PTHrP-(1-36) in a dose-dependent manner. The base-line cAMP production for these cultures was 30.7 ± 5.4 fmol/mg of protein, with maximal stimulation of 68.6 ± 8.2 fmol/mg of protein (p < 0.001). The half-maximum stimulation by PTHrP occurred at about 16 nM. For comparison, 25K produced only a small increase in cAMP (∼9 fmol/mg of protein), and maximal cAMP stimulation with forskolin (50 μM) was 874 ± 52 fmol/mg of protein (results of three experiments performed in duplicate). Cultures maintained in the depolarizing 25K medium exhibited high levels of PTHrP mRNA (Fig. 3A). When this medium was substituted by 5K medium with osmolality maintained constant by the addition of choline chloride, PTHrP mRNA decayed slowly over 3-4 h (Fig. 3, A). Replacement of conditioned with fresh (25K) medium, which would remove culture-derived growth and other factors, did not produce a similar decay in mRNA (Fig. 3A, right part). The loss of PTHrP mRNA in 5K medium was not due to cell injury, as shown by the slow return of PTHrP mRNA back to control levels by reexposure to 25K medium (Fig. 3A, left part). The dynamics of PTHrP induction are shown in more detail in Fig. 3B. In order to visualize the PTHrP induced by 25K stimulation, cells in all subsequent experiments were pretreated for 3-4 h in 5K so that PTHrP mRNA levels prior to stimulation would be minimal. After 1 h of depolarization, faint but detectable mRNA was present, with continued increases up to a plateau at 4 h, equal to the base line. Exposure of cultures to graded depolarization reliably induced PTHrP mRNA at 15K, but not at 10K (Fig. 3C). However, depolarizing conditions alone were not sufficient for PTHrP mRNA induction, since treatment of cultures with strongly depolarizing concentrations of the Na+ channel agonists veratridine (0.5-25 μM), glutamate (0.1-10 mM), monensin (5 μM), or the Na+,K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain (1 mM) did not induce PTHrP mRNA. Use of the potent glutamate agonist, NMDA (100 μM), also failed to induce PTHrP mRNA in cultures maintained at 5K but did activate expression in those maintained at 15K (data not shown). The abundant level of PTHrP mRNA in depolarized granule cells required Ca2+ in the extracellular medium, as shown by an experiment in which cultures were pretreated with 5K for 4 h and then reexposed to 25K with varying medium [Ca2+] (Fig. 4). Elimination of Ca2+ in the medium resulted in no detectable PTHrP mRNA. A sharp Ca2+ concentration-dependent response curve was observed under 25 mM K+ conditions, such that minimal PTHrP was detected with 0.6 mM Ca2+ present, while at ≥ 1.2 mM Ca2+ large increases were appreciated (Fig. 4). Cells maintained in zero-added Ca2+ for 4 h remained viable, since they demonstrated a robust PTHrP mRNA response when placed in 1.2 mM Ca2+ (“add-back”). This Ca2+-dependent PTHrP mRNA induction was virtually completely blocked by the addition of 10−9 to 10−6M NTR (Fig. 5A). Direct assessment of Ca2+ flux using 45Ca confirmed that an appreciable (∼15-20%) amount of Ca2+ flux was blocked by 1 nM NTR at 25K, while under 5K conditions no NTR-sensitive flux was observed (Fig. 6). Further, this NTR-sensitive calcium flux remained constant for at least 3 h (Fig. 6). The addition of nanomolar concentrations of NTR directly to 25K cultures also produced a decrease in PTHrP mRNA, with the same slow decay kinetics as observed after a change to nondepolarizing (5K) conditions (data not shown).Fig. 5Activity of the L-VSCC is necessary for PTHrP gene expression. A, blockade of L-VSCC inhibits PTHrP transcription. Neurons were preincubated 4 h in 5K (Pretx) and stimulated for 4 h with 25K along with the specific L-channel antagonist NTR at the concentrations indicated. B, activation of L-VSCC induces PTHrP gene expression. Cerebellar cultures were pretreated for 4 h in 5K and then switched to synthetic media with 15 mM K+ with the extracellular Ca2+ concentration as indicated in the presence (+) or absence (−) of the L-VSCC agonist Bay K-8644.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6K+-induced PTHrP mRNA occurs via L-VSCC flux.

To test this hypothesis we have investigated the effect of calponin on the strong binding of S-1·MgAMP-PNP (5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphate) and on the weak binding of S-1·MgADP·Pi to actin.

https://openalex.org/W2023506192,"Extracellular secretion of the peptide antibiotic colicin V (ColV) in Escherichia coli is mediated by a dedicated exporter system consisting of host TolC protein and the products of two specific genes, cvaA and cvaB, the latter being a member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. An amino-terminal export signal of ColV is specific for the CvaA-CvaB-TolC exporter and is processed concomitant with secretion. In this study, we attempt to characterize this processing with a secretable marker protein, ColV-1, using a newly developed in vitro assay. Processing is found to be dependent on both CvaA-CvaB transporters and the TolC protein and to require membrane integrity. An additional cytoplasmic soluble factor(s) is also necessary for the processing. Although the sequence of the cleavage site suggests it could be a substrate, ColV-1 cannot be processed in vitro by the purified leader peptidase I. Moreover, ColV-1 processing is inhibited by antipain and N-ethylmaleimide. Furthermore, the processing requires energy in the form of nucleotide hydrolysis. These results indicate that the processing of ColV-1 is specific and more complex than expected, requiring the CvaA-CvaB-TolC transporter intact in the membrane, energy, and cytosolic factors for rapid cleavage."

https://openalex.org/W1963676329,"R67 dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) provides resistance to the antibacterial drug trimethoprim. This R-plasmid-encoded enzyme does not share any homology with chromosomal DHFR. A recent crystal structure of active, homotetrameric R67 DHFR (Narayana, N., Matthews, D. A., Howell, E. E., and Xuong, N.-H. (1995) Nat. Struct. Biol. 2, 1018-1025) indicates that a single active site pore traverses the length of the molecule. Since the center of the pore possesses exact 222 symmetry, site-directed mutagenesis of residues in the pore will produce four mutations/active site. To break this inevitable symmetry, four copies of the gene have been linked in frame to create an active monomer possessing the essential tertiary structure of native tetrameric R67 DHFR. The protein product, quadruple R67 DHFR, is 4 times the molecular mass of native R67 DHFR in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and is monomeric under nondenaturing conditions as measured by sedimentation equilibrium experiments. The catalytic activity of quadruple R67 DHFR is decreased only slightly when compared with native R67 DHFR. Folding of quadruple R67 DHFR is completely reversible at pH 5. However, at pH 8, folding is not fully reversible; this is likely due to a competition between productive intramolecular versus nonproductive intermolecular domain association.

Recent protein engineering studies of oligomeric proteins have attempted to shift the assembly equilibrium toward the protomer by the introduction of destabilizing mutations at subunit interfaces (Refs. 1Borchert T.V.

These studies allow the functional role of protein-protein interactions at subunit interfaces to be probed. This strategy assumes that most oligomeric proteins possessing n protomers possess n active sites and is less useful for enzymes that have active sites to which several subunits contribute. In contrast to the above approach that forms monomers by dissociation of the native oligomeric species, we have constructed an active, stable monomeric form of R67 dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) 1The abbreviations used are: DHFRdihydrofolate reductaseGdnHClguanidine hydrochlorideCDcircular dichroismMES4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acidquadruple R67 DHFRa monomer created by quadruplication of the R67 DHFR gene that possesses the essential tertiary structure of native, tetrameric R67 DHFRtriple R67 DHFRthe gene product from the triplicated genedouble R67 DHFRthe gene product from the duplicated gene. by association. This strategy involves the use of genetic engineering techniques to covalently link four protomers together.

In R67 DHFR, a 222 symmetry element occurs at the center of the pore, and crystallography and binding studies indicate that two molecules of either substrate (dihydrofolate/folate) or cofactor (NADPH) can bind to both sides of the active site pore under binary complex conditions (4Narayana N. Matthews D.A. Howell E.E. Xuong N.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 5Bradrick T.D. Beechem J.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Under ternary complex conditions, a total of two ligands can be bound; the possibilities include two NADPH molecules, two folate molecules, or one NADPH and one folate bound on opposite sides of the pore. The latter is the productive ternary complex. Cofactor inhibition is not observed due to negative cooperativity between two bound NADPH molecules (microscopic Kd values of 5 and 48 μM), and substrate inhibition is not observed due to positive cooperativity between two bound dihydrofolate molecules (microscopic Kd values of 250 and 4.4 μM; Ref. 5Bradrick T.D. Beechem J.M. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This model for catalysis predicts that either dihydrofolate or NADPH can bind to each half-pore, although presumably with different orientations. Because of the 222 symmetry in the active site of tetrameric R67 DHFR, mutagenesis of residues designed to explore substrate binding will also affect cofactor binding. To break the inevitable symmetry of this active site and make asymmetric mutations, we have engineered tandem arrays of the gene. As a first step toward this goal, we duplicated the gene and characterized the active dimer that resulted (6Zhuang P. Ming Y. Holland J.C. Peterson C.B. Howell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22672-22679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have now quadruplicated the gene and characterized the active, monomeric gene product. In addition, a byproduct of the cloning step was a gene triplication event. These genes and methods will allow us to break the symmetry of the active site and introduce a prescribed number of mutations in specific positions. It will also let us ask whether covalent linkage of four identical subunits introduces competition during folding reactions and results in nonproductive protein association and/or altered folding topologies. An ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit from Perkin Elmer was used to sequence the quadruplicated R67 DHFR gene. The reactions were run on an ABI373A Stretch Automated Sequencer (Perkin Elmer) using Well-to-Read plates. A Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) was used to read the triplicated gene sequence.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and data for double R67 DHFR were fit to the following, Fluobs=Flumono−Fludi[H]2n/(4KoverallPtot}{(−1+(1+8KoverallPtot/[H]2n1/2+Fludi(Eq. 3) where Koverall = ([dimer] [H]2n)/[monomer·H2n2] in units of M, M2, or M3 for n = 1, 1.5, or 2, respectively; Fluobs is the observed fluorescence; Flumono and Fludi are the calculated limits for monomer and dimer fluorescence at low and high pH values; and Ptot is the total protein concentration. The quadruple R67 DHFR data were fit to a simple ionization equation (Equations 5 from Ref. 14Fersht, A. R., 1985, Enzyme Structure and Mechanism, 2nd Ed., pp. 155–175, W. H. Freeman and Co., New York.Google Scholar), where the number of protons was also a variable. To facilitate comparison, all the data were normalized by fitting to Fapp = (Yobs− YpH8)/(YpH4− YpH8), where Fapp is a fractional value between 0 and 1 and Yobs, YpH8, and YpH4 are the optical values associated with the observed pH and with the pH limits of 8 and 4, respectively. Within error, a plot of the fluorescence intensity at 350 nm yields the same fit values, although the pre- and posttransitional slopes are more substantial for the intensity data (15Eftink M.R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 482-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Sedimentation analyses of the R67 DHFR variants were performed with a Beckman XL-A Optima analytical ultracentrifuge using a four-hole An-55 rotor. Equilibrium experiments were performed at 25°C and a rotor speed of 25,000 rpm, whereas velocity experiments were performed at 20°C and a rotor speed of 50,000 rpm. The concentration distribution of the samples at sedimentation equilibrium was acquired as an average of 25 measurements of absorbance at each radial position, with nominal spacing of 0.001 cm between radial positions. Sedimentation velocity data were collected every 2 min after attaining speed in a single measurement with nominal spacing of 0.003 cm between radial positions. Equilibrium data were analyzed as described previously (12Nichols R. Weaver C.D. Eisenstein E. Blakley R.L. Appleman J. Huang T.-H. Huang F.-Y. Howell E.E.

Sedimentation velocity data were analyzed to yield sedimentation coefficients by using the time derivative of the boundary, g* (s)t, as described by Stafford (16Stafford III, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) using instrumentally supplied software. The hydrodynamic shape of R67 DHFR under various conditions was estimated by determining the frictional coefficient of the molecule from the sedimentation coefficient using the Svedberg equation and by assuming a level of hydration of 0.4 g of H2O/g of protein (17Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1980: 560-570Google Scholar). These values were then compared with the frictional coefficient calculated from the semiaxes of a prolate ellipsoid, a torus (18Allison S.A. Easterly R.A. Teller D.C. Biopolymers. 1980; 19: 1475-1489Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), or a cylinder with dimensions corresponding to those of the R67 DHFR structure. Equilibrium unfolding curves at pH 5.0 were monitored as a function of guanidine HCl (GdnHCl) concentration (6Zhuang P. Ming Y. Holland J.C. Peterson C.B. Howell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22672-22679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Reece L.J. Nichols R. Ogden R.C. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10895-10904Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The emission spectra for the DHFRs (excitation, 295 nm) were measured from 300 to 450 nm at each denaturant concentration (between 0 and 5 M GdnHCl). The intensity-averaged emission wavelength for each emission spectrum was calculated and normalized as described above. The Gibbs free energy change, ΔG, between folded and unfolded states can then be calculated by nonlinear regression of the following equation for both double and quadruple R67 DHFR data, Yobs=({YN0+MN[GdnHcl] + (YU0+MU[Gdnhcl] exp(-1(ΔGH2O+MG[GdnHcl]/RT}/{1+exp(−1(ΔGH2O+MG[GdnHcl])/RT)}(Eq. 4) where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, ΔGH2O is the free energy change between native and unfolded protein in the absence of GdnHCl, MG is the slope describing the dependence of ΔG on denaturant concentration, YN0 and YU0 are the concentration-independent optical values, and MN and MU are the slopes of the pre- and post-transition regions, respectively (6Zhuang P. Ming Y. Holland J.C. Peterson C.B. Howell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22672-22679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The native R67 DHFR equilibrium folding data were fit to Equation 4 in Reece et al. (19Reece L.J. Nichols R. Ogden R.C. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10895-10904Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Within error, a plot of the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm yields the same fitted values, although the pre- and post-transitional slopes are more substantial for the intensity data (15Eftink M.R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 482-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of 5 μM protein2 in MTA buffer without β-mercaptoethanol were obtained using a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter at 22°C. For each sample, 10 spectra were obtained using 1-nm steps and 2-s integrations, and an averaged spectrum was calculated. A buffer base-line scan was subtracted from the averaged protein scan. The mean residue ellipticity calculated for the CD data used 108 g/mol as the mean residue molecular weight. Previous results were helpful in designing a gene coding for monomeric R67 DHFR. First, a crystal structure of the dimeric form of R67 DHFR indicates 16-18 N-terminal amino acids are disordered in each monomer (20Matthews D.A. Smith S.L. Baccanari D.P. Burchall J.J. Oatley S.J. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4194-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In accord with this observation, removal of 16 N-terminal residues by chymotrypsin treatment does not affect activity (19Reece L.J. Nichols R. Ogden R.C. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10895-10904Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Also the addition of 27 amino acids to the C terminus of R67 DHFR had no effect on activity (21Brisson N. Hohn T. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Finally, gene duplication successfully produced active dimer that possesses the essential tertiary structure of native tetramer (6Zhuang P. Ming Y. Holland J.C. Peterson C.B. Howell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22672-22679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the functional core of R67 DHFR consists of the β-barrel structure formed by residues 27-77 and that extending and/or fusing the N and C termini of adjacent monomers might reasonably be expected not to impair function. The crystal structure of chymotrypsin-truncated, tetrameric R67 DHFR is shown in Fig. 1A, and the N and C termini are indicated. 3The amino acids in the first monomer are labeled 1-78, those in the second monomer 101-178, those in the third monomer 201-278, and those in the fourth monomer 301-378. For brevity, when a single residue is mentioned here, all four residues are implied. This nomenclature is retained when double and quadruple R67 DHFR are discussed although residue 78 is followed in frame by residue 101, etc. In designing a link between monomers, we simply used the natural N-terminal sequence (MIRSSNEVSNPVAGNFV). A linker between the C terminus (Asn78) of monomer A and the N terminus (Val117) of monomer B would span ≥28 Å (shortest straight line distance). A linker between the C terminus of monomer B (Asn278) and the N terminus of either monomer C or D (Val217 or Val317) would span >42 Å. What are the possibilities for domain topology in quadruple R67 DHFR? Six connectivities are shown in Fig. 1B. The two simplest connections are ABCD and ABDC, where two covalent linkages span the monomer-monomer interfaces (A to B and C to D; ≥28 Å, straight line distance) and only one link crosses the dimer-dimer interface (AB to CD; ≥42 Å). Alternatively, the domains could fold with connectivities of ACDB or ADCB with two covalent links crossing the dimer-dimer interfaces and only one link spanning the monomer-monomer interface. A third possibility is a connectivity of ADBC or ACBD, where three long links span the protein. Or the domains could fold into any mixture of these species. Quadruplication of the R67 DHFR gene was accomplished by a multistep process described in the legend to Fig. 2. The resulting plasmids carrying either three or four in-frame gene copies were named pTRIPLE or pQUAD, respectively. The corresponding proteins were named triple and quadruple R67 DHFR. In these constructs, the C-terminal Asn78 residue coded for by gene copy 1 is followed in frame by the N-terminal Met1 coded for by gene copy 2 and so on. To eliminate homologous recombination between the identical gene copies, STBL2 E. coli cells (F−mcrA Δ(mcrBChsdRMS-mrr) recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi supE44 relA1 λ− Δ(lac-proAB); Life Technologies, Inc.) were utilized. No recombination has been observed utilizing this strain, whereas recombination readily occurs in E. coli JM109 and SURE (Stratagene) strains. To confirm that no extraneous mutations occurred during the cloning process, the complementary strand of the first two copies of the quadruplicated gene was sequenced using double-stranded DNA template and a primer binding to the −54 →−25 region 5′ of the coding sequence. The coding strand for the last two copies of the quadruplicated gene was sequenced using a second primer that binds just outside the coding region. More than 470 bases were read for each reaction to sequence each half of the quadruplicated gene sequence unambiguously. Oligonucleotides that are complementary to the coding sequence were not used, since they could bind to any/all of the gene copies, and a unique sequence would not be determined. No extraneous mutations were found. Both proteins resulting from gene triplication and quadruplication were purified to homogeneity. As shown in Fig. 3, triple and quadruple R67 DHFR migrate in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 3-4 times the apparent molecular mass of the native monomer. The duplicated gene product is additionally shown for comparison. Native R67 DHFR is a tetramer at high pH (≥8.0) that undergoes a pH-dependent, reversible dissociation to form dimers at low pH (≤5.0; Ref. 12Nichols R. Weaver C.D. Eisenstein E. Blakley R.L. Appleman J. Huang T.-H. Huang F.-Y. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Dissociation is linked to ionization of His62 and its symmetry-related partners, His162, His262, and His362. In a similar fashion, double R67 DHFR is a dimer at pH 8.0 that dissociates into monomers at pH 5.0. Quadruple R67 DHFR would not be expected to dissociate, since the covalent linkages introduced at the gene level would transform the native 78-amino acid protomers into domains. However, quadruple R67 DHFR may undergo a conformational change from a “closed” to a “more extended” form upon histidine ionization as the pH decreases. Therefore, the ability of quadruple R67 DHFR to fold into a native-like structure was evaluated using several techniques at low and high pH. Sedimentation equilibrium data indicate quadruple R67 DHFR is a single species of molecular mass 33,400 and 35,050 at pH 5 and 8, respectively. In contrast, triple R67 DHFR is a mixture of dimeric and monomeric species with a monomeric molecular mass of 25,300 at pH 5. At pH 8.0, triple R67 DHFR is a mixture of tetrameric and dimeric species with molecular weights that are 4- and 2-fold multiples of 25,000. Apparently the gene triplication product can associate into several different protein oligomerization states. It is surprising that a monomeric triple species is observed at pH 5, since it would be expected to have hydrophobic residues exposed to solvent (an intersubunit β-barrel forms at the monomer-monomer interface in native R67 DHFR). The triplication gene product was not characterized further due to the mixture of species. At pH 8, quadruple R67 DHFR yielded a sedimentation coefficient of 2.75 S. Briefly, shape information was obtained from the sedimentation coefficients by estimating the frictional factor due solely to shape by first calculating f/fo and then correcting this value for hydration assuming 0.4 g of H2O/g of protein. At pH 8, this yields an estimated value for the frictional coefficient for a toroid, fe, of 4.86 × 10 −8. This value is in good agreement with the predicted value of fe for a toroid with r = 8.5 Å and R = 16.5 Å, the average values for R67 DHFR estimated from the x-ray structure, where R is the distance from center of mass of the torus to the center of the ring, and r is the inner toroidal radius (18Allison S.A. Easterly R.A. Teller D.C. Biopolymers. 1980; 19: 1475-1489Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). At pH 5, a sedimentation coefficient of 2.36 S was obtained for quadruple R67 DHFR, which immediately suggested a hydrodynamic swelling of the protein at low pH values. An estimate for fe (obs) of 5.652 × 10−8 g/s at pH 5 was obtained. The experimentally determined value for fe obtained at low pH was compared with estimates for frictional coefficients for various shapes (prolate and oblate ellipsoid, toroid, cylinder) based on approximate dimensions of the x-ray structure. This comparison suggested that at low pH, the molecule could be represented either as a “swollen” toroid with approximately a 21% increase in hydrodynamic volume or as an elongated cylinder-like particle with a width of 18 Å and a length of about 150 Å, yielding a linker length of about 58 Å. This linker length approximates that expected if the 16-amino acid linker were to adopt an extended conformation. Circular dichroism spectra for quadruple R67 DHFR at pH 5.0 and 7.0 are shown in Fig. 4. The spectrum for quadruple R67 DHFR at pH 7 is similar to those for native and double R67 DHFRs, although subtle changes are observed. A larger difference is observed at pH 5.0. A more quantitative measure of the pH-dependent association/dissociation is afforded by alterations in protein fluorescence as Trp38 and its symmetry-related residues Trp138, Trp238, and Trp338 occur at the dimer-dimer interfaces in native R67 DHFR (or the monomer-monomer interfaces in double R67 DHFR or the domain-domain interfaces in quadruple R67 DHFR). A protein concentration-dependent titration in protein fluorescence has previously been shown to describe the following equilibrium in native R67 DHFR, where T is tetramer, DHn is protonated dimer, and Koverall = [T]·[Hn]2/[DHn]2 (12Nichols R. Weaver C.D. Eisenstein E. Blakley R.L. Appleman J. Huang T.-H. Huang F.-Y. Howell E.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fig. 5A compares the fluorescence emission scans for equivalent concentrations of native, double, and quadruple R67 DHFRs at pH 8 and 5. All three proteins show a red shift in peak wavelength going from pH 8 to 5. This observation is consistent with exposure of the tryptophans to a more hydrophilic environment upon tetramer to dimer dissociation (native) or dimer to monomer dissociation (double) or a conformational change from closed monomer to more extended monomer where the domain-domain interactions are disrupted due to His62 ionization (quadruple). The fluorescence quantum yield decreases for the series native → double → quadruple R67 DHFR when equivalent concentrations of protein are compared. Also, the effect of decreasing pH on the quantum yield varies throughout the native → double → quadruple series such that the fluorescence of native dimer is enhanced relative to that of native tetramer, while the fluorescence of the double monomer is almost equivalent to that of the double dimer, and the fluorescence of the more extended monomer for quadruple R67 DHFR is decreased with respect to the closed monomeric form. Clearly, the presence of 0, 2, and 3 linkers in the native, double, and quadruple R67 DHFRs has resulted in changes in the local environment of Trp38 and its symmetry-related partners. Since the natural N terminus is disordered from residues 1-17 in the dimer crystal structure, a reduction in the number of accessible conformations associated with the N terminus due to covalent tethering could result in interactions with the surface of the protein, including the normal dimer-dimer interface area where Trp38 resides. Fig. 5B plots the titration of the intensity-averaged wavelength 〈λ〉 as a function of pH for native R67 DHFR, double R67 DHFR, and quadruple R67 DHFR. The curves are superimposable for the native and double proteins, while the pKa for the quadruple protein is obviously decreased. Best fit values are shown in Table I.

https://openalex.org/W2037020894,"A gene encoding the ligand-binding domain of the Escherichia coli aspartate receptor fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase to produce the chimeric aspartate insulin receptor (AIR) was expressed in mammalian cells. A murine fibroblast transfectant line designated CA3 was generated that stably expressed the AIR receptor. This 70,000 Mr receptor containing the tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor was recognized by aspartate receptor-specific antisera. When isolated in cellular membrane preparations, AIR was found to be capable of autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of histone H2B on tyrosine. The receptor was found to be predominately cytoplasmic and to be situated in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes by immunofluorescence imaging of CA3 cells. Mitogenic effects of AIR were observed; CA3 cells continued DNA synthesis under serum deprivation conditions that prevented parental cells from cycling. These results demonstrate that a chimeric receptor containing procaryotic transmembrane sequences is expressed by a eucaryotic cell in intracellular membranes and functionally couples to cellular signaling pathways."

Nature. 1976; 260: 805-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Patel C.V. Gopinathan K.P. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 28: 521-530PubMed Google Scholar). While the overall tRNA content in posterior silk glands increases by at least 10-fold when fibroin synthesis is at its peak, the tRNAs cognate to the four abundant amino acids in fibroin account for about 70% of this increase. Understandably tRNA1Gly is most predominant, because the large 15-kb messenger RNA for the fibroin heavy chain contains about 2400 codons corresponding to glycine, of which nearly 50% are decoded by this tRNA species (28Fournier A. Biochimie (Paris). 1979; 61: 283-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). tRNA1Gly constitutes a multigene family with an estimated 20 copies in B. mori, and 10 of them have been cloned and characterized previously (16Fournier A.F. Taneja R. Gopalkrishnan R. Prudhomme J.C. Gopinathan K.P. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All these copies have identical coding sequences but differ in their flanking regions and show varying levels of transcription. None of these genes appear to be silk gland-specific. In this communication, we have attempted to decipher the mechanisms by which some copies are rendered silent, by comparative transcription analysis of a set of tRNA1Gly genes belonging to the extreme groups (highly or poorly transcribed). We demonstrate here the involvement of negative regulatory cis elements located at distances much farther upstream or downstream to the coding region than believed earlier. Crude nuclear extracts from posterior silk glands of B. mori in the fifth larval instar were prepared as described previously (15Taneja R. Gopalkrishnan R. Gopinathan K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1070-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In brief, freshly dissected out posterior silk glands were homogenized in buffer (2 M sucrose, 10% glycerol, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 15 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 M PMSF, 0.15 M spermine, 0.15 M spermidine, and 1 mM EDTA, (10 ml/g tissue)). The homogenate was layered on a cushion of the above buffer and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 1 h at 4°C in a Beckman SW28 Ti rotor. The pelleted nuclei were lysed by gently stirring with 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, and 0.5 mM DTT) and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The clear supernantant was dialyzed for 4 h against the dialysis buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.1 M KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, and 0.5 mM DTT) and used as crude nuclear extracts for in vitro transcription. In vitro transcription reactions in a final volume of 25 μl contained: 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 6 mM creatine phosphate, 50 μM each of ATP, CTP, and UTP, 10 μM GTP, 5 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol), crude nuclear extract (25 μg of protein), and 4-8 μg/ml supercoiled plasmid DNA template. After incubation at 30°C for 1 h, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.2% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, and 100 μg/ml glycogen (carrier) and processed as described previously (15Taneja R. Gopalkrishnan R. Gopinathan K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1070-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Quantification of transcription was carried out by laser densitometric scanning of the autoradiographs at different exposures to ensure the sensitivity and range of detection. DNA sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy method using the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The parental clones pR8 and pBms1 harboring tRNA1Gly-1, −6, and −7 from B. mori were those described previously (16Fournier A.F. Taneja R. Gopalkrishnan R. Prudhomme J.C. Gopinathan K.P. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The clone pBmg1 (a gift from A. Fournier) carried a 3.2-kb insert of B. mori chromosomal DNA harboring a copy of glycyl tRNA gene, designated here as tRNA1Gly-11. All other constructs were generated by exploiting the restriction sites (marked in Fig. 1) in the appropriate clones either within the coding region or in the flanking regions. For subcloning, the vectors pTZ18/19 (Pharmacia) or pBS KS+ (Stratagene) were used. Site-directed mutagenesis of the TATATAA element was done by Kunkel's method (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). An oligodeoxyribonucleotide, 5′-CCATTTAAGGAAGATATCAATAAAATAGAG-3′ was used to mutagenize the two highly conserved nucleotides of TATAT AA to GATAT CA, generating a new restriction site (EcoRV). The mutants were initially screened by digestion of plasmid DNAs with EcoRV and confirmed by sequencing. We have described previously 10 copies of tRNA1Gly from B. mori, serially designated as tRNA1Gly-1 to −10 (16Fournier A.F. Taneja R. Gopalkrishnan R. Prudhomme J.C. Gopinathan K.P. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). An additional copy of the gene, tRNA1Gly-11 present in clone pBmg1, as well as copies of tRNA1Gly-1, −6, and −7, their deletion derivatives and domain-swapped, or hybrid constructs generated for detailed analysis in the present study are listed in Fig. 1. The 11 copies of tRNA1Gly from B. mori have been analyzed by transcription in vitro in homologous nuclear extracts derived from posterior silk glands (Fig. 2, a and b). Each of the gene copies gave rise to two transcripts corresponding to an approximately 75-nt precursor and 71-nt mature transcript (Fig. 2a). However, the presence of a slightly longer transcript, about 80 nt, was discernible in lane 6 (see later sections) and 8. tRNA1Gly-11, analyzed here for the first time, was transcribed to very high levels comparable with tRNA1Gly-1 (Fig. 2b). The quantitation of transcription efficiencies of these 11 gene copies relative to the highly transcribed tRNA1Gly-1 is presented in Fig. 2c. The variability in the levels of transcription of individual copies was highly consistent (+5%) in several independent experiments using different batches of nuclear extracts and plasmid template DNA preparations. In every individual analysis the transcription levels were normalized to that of tRNA1Gly-1 taken as 100%. Based on the in vitro transcriptions, evidently, the genes could be classified into three groups, viz. those which are transcribed to very high levels (tRNA1Gly-1 and −11), medium to high levels (tRNA1Gly- 2, −3, −4, and −5), and low to undetectable levels (tRNA1Gly-6, −7, −8, −9, and −10). Since all these gene copies had identical coding sequences (16Fournier A.F. Taneja R. Gopalkrishnan R. Prudhomme J.C. Gopinathan K.P. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar),2 and consequently the same ICRs, their differential transcription could be attributed to the flanking sequences, upstream or downstream. The differences in transcription levels were not just due to the differences in the size of inserts in various constructs, because the gene copies 10 and 11 (present on 3-kb genomic fragments in each case, in plasmids pBmj1 and pBmg1, respectively) belonged to the opposite groups in terms of transcriptional efficiency. Neither did the plasmid vector sequences exert any noticeable influence on transcription, because the same tRNA1Gly copy in different vector backgrounds showed identical levels of transcription in vitro. Comparative studies were therefore made using the highly transcribed tRNA1Gly-1, and the poorly transcribed copies 6 and 7, to examine the influence of the flanking sequences on transcriptional modulation. The tRNA1Gly-6 and −7 are located in tandem and in the same orientation on a single chromosomal segment, but separated from each other by 425 nt (clone pBms1, Fig. 1). This construct gave rise to three weak but distinct transcripts, two of them corresponding to the precursor tRNA forms of gene copies 6 (75 nt) and 7 (81 nt), respectively, and the third (71 nt) corresponding to the mature transcript (lane 6, Fig. 2a). Comparison of their transcription with that of tRNA1Gly-1 revealed that at optimal template concentration, the highest levels of transcription of both the gene copies 6 and 7 together (in pBms1) were around 2-10% of the former (in pR8). Even at much higher molar equivalents of tRNA1Gly-6 and −7 template, the transcription levels never exceeded 5-10% of that of tRNA1Gly-1. In order to check whether the low transcription of the gene copies 6 and 7 could be due to their linkage in close proximity, they were separated from each other (clones ps1A harboring tRNA1Gly-6 and ps1B harboring tRNA1Gly-7) and analyzed. When unlinked from each other, individually they showed higher levels of transcription, approaching 60-65% of the levels of tRNA1Gly-1 (lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 3, a and b). The transcripts from both tRNA1Gly-6 (clone ps1A) and −7 (clone ps1B) were initiated at −4 with respect to the +1 nt of mature tRNA1Gly as deduced from primer extension analysis (data not shown) just as in the case of tRNA1Gly-1 (15Taneja R. Gopalkrishnan R. Gopinathan K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1070-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the transcript from gene copy 7 terminated 6 nt farther downstream, compared with gene copies and 6, and hence gave rise to the longer (81 nt) precursor transcript. In the process of separating out the two gene copies present together in the parental clone pBms1, although the coding region and the immediate flanking regions (up to −284 nt 5′ upstream and 33 nt 3′ downstream in tRNA1Gly-6 and −392 nt 5′ upstream and 213 nt 3′ downstream in tRNA1Gly-7) were unaltered and remained identical to those present in the parental construct, the far upstream and downstream regions as well as the sequences linking them were altered. The increase in the transcription of the gene copies 6 and 7 on isolating them from each other suggested that either the close linkage or those sequences that were eliminated or altered during their separation played a role in modulating their expression. If indeed the lower levels of transcription of the two genes in pBms1 were due to the gene linkage, the proximal presence of either gene copy 6 or 7 to the hyperexpressed tRNA1Gly-1 should have influenced the transcriptional efficiency of the latter. To test this possibility, dual gene constructs harboring the gene copies 1 and 7 were made (Fig. 1). We preferred gene copy 7 for such chimeric constructs, because the longer precursor transcript arising from this could be readily distinguished from that of gene copy 1. The three hybrid constructs generated for this purpose had the two gene copies in orientations, converging (in ps1BR8(C)), diverging (in pR8 s1B(D)) or parallel (in ps1BR8(P)), and in locations upstream or downstream with respect to each other (see Fig. 1). The in vitro transcription of these constructs revealed no significant changes in the levels of transcription of either copy, indicating that the gene context (i.e. the linkage or the orientation of the gene copies with respect to each other) had little influence on transcription (compare lanes 6 and 10 with lanes 1 and 3 and lane 11 with lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 4a). Even when the two gene copies 6 and 7 were brought back together to be placed in context of each other and restoring the original sequences that linked them (ps1A+B, see Fig. 1), there were no significant changes in their individual expression levels (Fig. 4b, lanes 5 and 6). This construct, ps1A+B, differed from the parental plasmid pBms1 harboring the same two gene copies 6 and 7 only by the absence of the 5′ far upstream flanking sequences (−284 to −976 nt with respect to +1 of tRNA1Gly-6) and 3′ far downstream sequences (+278 to +1518 nt with respect to +1 of tRNA1Gly-7). From the foregoing results, it was clear that deletion of far upstream or downstream sequences had resulted in 10-20-fold stimulation in transcription of gene copies 6 and 7 and that the linkage itself had little influence. In order to confirm that the down-regulation seen in the parental gene construct, pBms1, was indeed due to far upstream or downstream sequences, three more hybrid genes were constructed (plasmids pΔs1, ps1UR8, and ps1DR8 in Fig. 1). In the deletion construct pΔs1, the gene copies 6 and 7 in the parental clone pBms1 were fused in frame to generate a single copy of the gene (i.e. without altering the tRNA coding sequence) by removing parts of coding regions from both the gene copies as well as the intervening sequences. This hybrid gene, designated 6:7, retaining the entire 5′- and 3′-flanking regions (0.9 and 1.5 kb, respectively) was barely transcribed (Fig. 3a, lane 5) resembling the parental copies 6 and 7 in pBms1. As anticipated, the transcript from 6:7 was longer (81 nt), corresponding to the one arising from gene copy 7, because the transcription termination of the hybrid gene was derived from gene 7. The very low transcription levels of gene 6:7 thus confirmed the presence of cis-acting negative regulatory elements in those far upstream or downstream sequences, which were eliminated during the separation of tRNA1Gly-6 and −7 (in clones ps1A and ps1B, respectively). In order to further confirm the presence of negative regulatory elements, two other hybrid constructs, ps1UR8 and ps1DR8, generated by swapping the domains between tRNA1Gly-1 and −6 or −7 were exploited. In these constructs, either the entire 5′ upstream (300 nt) of tRNA1Gly-1 was replaced with the 976-nt sequences of gene copy 6 while retaining the 30-bp 3′-flanking sequences, in ps1UR8, or the complete 300-nt 5′-flanking sequences of tRNA1Gly-1 were retained while replacing the 30-nt downstream sequences with the 1.5-kb 3′-flanking sequences of gene copy 7, in ps1DR8 (Fig. 1). These hybrid genes, designated, respectively, as tRNA1Gly-6:1 or −1:7, had identical tRNA coding sequences but differed only in their flanking regions with respect to the parental copies. There was drastic reduction (by 10-15-fold) of transcription in both cases (Fig. 4, c and d, lanes 2 and 3, respectively), and the extent of inhibition was more pronounced in tRNA1Gly-1:7 (Fig. 4c, lane 3). Evidently, cis-acting negative regulatory elements are present in the far upstream sequences of the gene copy 6 as well as the far downstream sequences of the gene copy 7. In the immediate 5′ upstream sequences up to 100 nt of the tRNA1Gly genes, we could not identify any characteristic regulatory elements other than a few possible sequence motifs such as TTC, TATAT, and ATTT, present in all of them, irrespective of their transcriptional status (16Fournier A.F. Taneja R. Gopalkrishnan R. Prudhomme J.C. Gopinathan K.P. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The complete nucleotide sequence of the 3-kb chromosomal DNA fragment harboring both genes 6 and 7 present in the parental clone pBms1 was therefore determined (EMBL accession number Z49226). The sequences were generally AT-rich. The presence of a typical TATA box sequence element, TATATAA, at multiple locations, both upstream and downstream to the coding regions of the two tRNA copies 6 and 7, was conspicuous. Such a sequence motif (TATATAA) negatively influenced transcription of the highly transcribed tRNA1Gly-1 by about 35-40% (30Sharma S. Gopinathan K.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 396-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In order to check the influence of these TATATAA motifs on transcription of tRNA1Gly-6 and −7, a systematic deletion analysis was carried out. Three deletion constructs were generated such that the sequences containing either far upstream (−871 nt with respect to +1 nt of tRNA1Gly-6) or far downstream (+1019 nt and +1054 nt with respect to +1 nt of tRNA1Gly-7), and both far upstream and downstream TATATAA motifs were deleted in constructs pΔUTs1, pΔDTs1, and pΔ3Ts1, respectively (Fig. 5a). The deletion of the far flanking regions encompassing the TATATAA elements along with their flanking sequences in either upstream or downstream locations resulted in the enhancement of transcription (lanes 3-5 in Fig. 5, b and c). The transcription enhancement was mere pronounced in pΔ3Ts1 where both the upstream and downstream far localized elements were removed. In this case, the levels of transcription were the same or even higher than that of tRNA1Gly-1 (lane 5, Fig. 5b). In order to narrow down the sequence motif within the 440-bp sequences in pΔs1, which when deleted gave rise to enhancement in transcription (in pΔUTs, Fig. 5a), a 40-bp fragment from within this deleted sequence harboring the TATATAA element was reintroduced into the latter clone, such that this motif was reinstated in the upstream region (but at the same time devoid of the 400 bp previously present in the parental copy). This construct, designated p40ΔUTs1 (Fig. 6a) was barely transcribed (Fig. 6, lane 4). The insertion of the above 40-bp fragment thus brought down the transcription level to the same as that of the gene copy in pΔs1 (compare lane 4 with lanes 2 and 3), indicating further the role of TATATAA sequences in bringing down the transcription. In order to confirm that the enhancement in transcription in the deletion constructs was indeed due to the elimination of only the TATATAA sequence, this element was selectively mutagenized. The TATATAA motif located in the far upstream region of the construct ps1UR8 harboring tRNA1Gly-6:1 was mutagenized to GATATCA. This construct was chosen for the mutagenic analysis so that the influence of a single TATATAA element could be analyzed without interference from the identical elements localized downstream as in pΔs1 or pBms1. The tRNA copy present in this chimeric construct ps1UR8 was transcribed at very low levels amounting only to 10% of tRNA1Gly-1 (lane 3, Fig. 7). The mutagenized derivative, pmuts1UR8, harboring the mutation in far upstream localized TATATAA was transcribed to very high levels (comparable with that of wild-type tRNA1Gly-1) (lane 4, Fig. 7). Evidently the TATATAA motif was responsible for down-regulating the gene copies. In an alternate approach, a completely randomized synthetic DNA fragment harboring the TATATAA sequence was exploited to analyze the specific effect of the element on transcription. Such a fragment was reintroduced to a gene copy from which the negatively regulating region was deleted, and the effect of insertion of this sequence on transcription was analyzed. The 150-bp randomized sequence containing the TATATAA element corresponded to the region −150 nt to −300 nt upstream to tRNA1Gly-1 in clone pR8, which was shown to harbor the negative element (30Sharma S. Gopinathan K.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 396-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The above DNA fragment was generated synthetically and inserted into pΔDTs1, in which the downstream sequences harboring the two TATATAA sequences of pΔs1 were deleted such that the TATATAA sequences are now located 800 nt downstream to the tRNA coding region (Fig. 6b). When this construct pΔran150DTs1 was analyzed the transcription level was found to be considerably decreased (Fig. 6, lane 5), resembling the original parent construct pΔs1 (lane 2) in contrast to the deletion derivative (lanes 5 and 6). The above results are consistent with the conclusion that the TATATAA element was responsible for bringing down the transcription. The tRNA1Gly constitutes a multigene family in B. mori, with an estimated copy number of 20. We have compared here, under identical conditions, the transcription in vitro of 11 individual members of this multigene family in homologous posterior silk gland nuclear extracts. These gene copies showed wide variations in the efficiency of transcription. Based on the in vitro transcription, they could be classified into three groups, showing very high, medium, or very low levels of transcription. All the tRNA1Gly copies had identical coding sequences and consequently absolute identity of their internal conserved regions, the A- and B-boxes. Evidently, therefore, the flanking sequences should be responsible for modulating their levels of transcription. Such modulations could be due to the presence or absence of positive as well as negative elements, alone and in combination to achieve the expressions ranging from very high levels to the complete silencing. We have examined in detail two sets of tRNA1Gly copies belonging to the highly transcribed (tRNA1Gly-1) and barely transcribed (tRNA1Gly-6 and −7) categories. Under optimal conditions, the in vitro transcriptions of tRNA1Gly-6 and −7 together accounted for only 2-10% or less of the transcription of tRNA1Gly-1. The possibility that the low level of transcription of gene copies 6 and 7 is due to their close linkage on a single DNA fragment was suggested initially because when the two genes were unlinked, individually they were transcribed to high levels (60-65% of the tRNA1Gly-1). If indeed the close linkage of the genes was responsible for the low transcriptions, bringing either of the gene copies 6 or 7 in proximity to the highly transcribed tRNA1Gly-1 should have resulted in the lowering of the transcription of the latter. However, when the gene copies 1 and 7 were brought together in tandem on the same DNA fragment, there was barely any effect on the transcription of either gene copies. This lack of interference was independent of the orientation of the linked gene copies, whether they were placed in parallel, converging, or diverging modes. Therefore, the linkage itself seemed to exert very little influence on transcription. Nevertheless, one could argue that the disruption of intervening sequences linking the gene copies 6 and 7 in pBms1 during their separation from each other was responsible for reduced transcription. This possibility was also ruled out, because when the two isolated genes were brought back together (in clone ps1A+B), just as they were in the parental clone pBms1, the higher levels of transcription of the individual copies were still retained. The difference between this construct ps1A+B and the parental clone pBms1 was that the latter contained additional 5′ upstream (−284 to −976 nt with respect to +1 nt of tRNA1Gly-6) and 3′ downstream (+278 to +1518 nt with respect to +1 nt of tRNA1Gly-7) sequences. These flanking regions should, therefore, be harboring the negative regulatory elements involved in silencing the gene copies, 6 and 7. The presence of such regulatory elements was confirmed by analyzing several additional tRNA1Gly constructs. For instance, a deletion construct (pΔs1) harboring a single copy of the gene tRNA1Gly-6:7, generated by fusion of the gene copies 6 and 7 from the parental clone pBms1 and thus harboring the entire 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences (but devoid of the linker region between the gene copies), gave rise to extremely low levels of transcription. The presence of negative regulatory sequences in both 5′- and 3′-flanking regions was also evident because either of the regions alone when swapped with the corresponding domains of tRNA1Gly-1 (in plasmid constructs ps1UR8 or ps1DR8) resulted in near complete abolition of the transcription of the latter. The negative elements present in the 3′-flanking regions of tRNA1Gly-7 thus appeared to override the effect of positive elements resident in the immediate 5′ upstream sequences of tRNA1Gly-1 and brought down the transcription of the latter. The silencing of gene activity by negative elements may serve as an important means for modulating Pol III transcription. A pertinent question that can be raised is whether these differential expression patterns of individual tRNA genes hold good in vivo. However, it is not possible to discriminate the tRNA transcripts arising from the individual genes in vivo by the standard procedures such as primer extensions or RNase protection assays, because all of them have identical coding sequences and yield the same size transcripts. As an alternative, therefore, we used “oligotagged” copies of some of these genes and monitored their transcription in the B. mori-derived BmN cell lines following transfection. 3S. Sharma and K. P. Gopinathan, manuscript in preparation. Our results clearly established that the in vivo transcription levels followed the same pattern as seen in vitro. What then is the relevance of this differential expression of tRNA genes in vivo? The expression of tRNAs is generally believed to be housekeeping function but in the highly specialized situations like the posterior silk gland of B. mori (that undergoes a functional adaptation to optimize the synthesis of large quantities of fibroin in a development stage specific manner), many such gene copies, which are otherwise rendered silent, may have to be turned on to meet the additional demands. Considering the nature of the cis-acting negative regulatory element, it is conceivable that the availability of transcription factors can dictate their transcriptional status (see the following section), especially in the absence of any tissue specifically expressed copy of tRNA1Gly in B. mori (16Fournier A.F. Taneja R. Gopalkrishnan R. Prudhomme J.C. Gopinathan K.P. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 134: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 28Fournier A. Biochimie (Paris). 1979; 61: 283-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). While the posterior silk gland of B. mori represents an extreme manifestation of functional adaptation, such a situation may prove to be of common occurrence in the specialized tissues of multicellular eucaryotes. The presence of regulatory sequences located at such farther upstream or downstream regions for a set of Pol III transcribed genes described here is rather novel, although the location of regulatory sequences, like enhancers and silencers, at considerable distances (10-15 kb or even more) is commonly seen in the case of Pol II transcribed genes. The sequence analysis of the entire chromosomal DNA insert fragment revealed that it was AT-rich in nature and contained typical TATA-like elements in both upstream and downstream flanking regions. A sequence motif “TATATAA” located about 270 nt 5′ upstream to the coding region of the highly transcribed tRNA1Gly-1 down-regulated transcription of this gene (30Sharma S. Gopinathan K.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 396-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). There were four such typical elements in the flanking regions of tRNA1Gly-6 and −7. Of the two TATATAA sequence motifs present in the upstream region of tRNA1Gly-6, one was present in the immediate 5′ vicinity and the other one at −871 nt with respect to the tRNA coding region. The 3′ downstream TATATAA sequences were located beyond 1 kb downstream to the coding region of tRNA1Gly-7. These far upstream and downstream elements negatively influenced the transcriptional status of the gene copies 6 and 7, because their deletion resulted in enhancement of transcription. Reintroduction of a 40-bp DNA fragment harboring TATATAA sequences to the upstream deleted construct or a completely randomized 150-bp sequence harboring the TATATAA motif to the downstream deleted construct resulted in the inhibition of transcription in both cases. Moreover mutagenesis of a single TATATAA motif located at −871 nt upstream in the parental construct resulted in the restoration of transcription. How do the regulatory elements, located so far upstream or downstream to the coding regions, modulate the transcription of tRNA by Pol III is not known, although mechanisms similar to those postulated for Pol II transcribed genes involving DNA structural alterations as well as protein-protein interactions are likely to be operative. Our general premise now is that these TATATAA elements compete for transcription factors such as TBP (or the TATA-associated factors and other components of TFIIIB which associate with TBP) and bring about inhibition by sequestration of these factors, especially under conditions when they are limiting, as in nuclear extracts in vitro. A single such element brings about inhibition by 35-40% as in tRNA1Gly-1 (30Sharma S. Gopinathan K.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 396-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or by more than 90% combinatorially with three such elements as in tRNA1Gly-6 and −7. The sequestration effect is position-dependent, because the TATATAA element located in the immediate vicinity of the transcription start site enhances transcription (as in tRNA1Gly-6) presumably by additional recruitment of TBP, over and above that achieved through TFIIIB binding. One obvious question whether the inhibitory effect could be reversed by supplementation of TBP could not be answered due to the squelching effect of TBP, resulting in depletion of factors.2 Thus by regulating the availability of transcription factors in vivo, differential regulation of gene expression from within multigene families can be achieved.
