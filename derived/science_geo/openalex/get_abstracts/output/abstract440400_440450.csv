Selective activation of different glutamatergic inputs to the NAc can produce divergent physiological and behavioral responses, but mechanistic explanations for these pathway-specific effects are lacking. Here, we compared the innervation patterns and synaptic properties of ventral hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, and prefrontal cortex input to the NAc. Ventral hippocampal input was found to be uniquely localized to the medial NAc shell, where it was predominant and selectively potentiated after cocaine exposure. In vivo, bidirectional optogenetic manipulations of this pathway attenuated and enhanced cocaine-induced locomotion. Challenging the idea that any of these inputs encode motivationally neutral information, activation of each discrete pathway reinforced instrumental behaviors. Finally, direct optical activation of medium spiny neurons proved to be capable of supporting self-stimulation, demonstrating that behavioral reinforcement is an explicit consequence of strong excitatory drive to the NAc."

https://openalex.org/W2147892435,"Synchronization occurs widely in the natural and technological worlds, from the rhythm of applause and neuron firing to the quantum mechanics of coupled Josephson junctions, but has not been used to produce new spatial structures. Our understanding of self-assembly has evolved independently in the fields of chemistry and materials, and with a few notable exceptions has focused on equilibrium rather than dynamical systems. Here we combine these two phenomena to create synchronization-selected microtubes of Janus colloids, micron-sized spherical particles with different surface chemistry on their opposing hemispheres, which we study using imaging and computer simulation. A thin nickel film coats one hemisphere of each silica particle to generate a discoid magnetic symmetry, such that in a precessing magnetic field its dynamics retain crucial phase freedom. Synchronizing their motion, these Janus spheres self-organize into micrometre-scale tubes in which the constituent particles rotate and oscillate continuously. In addition, the microtube must be tidally locked to the particles, that is, the particles must maintain their orientation within the rotating microtube. This requirement leads to a synchronization-induced structural transition that offers various applications based on the potential to form, disintegrate and fine-tune self-assembled in-motion structures in situ. Furthermore, it offers a generalizable method of controlling structure using dynamic synchronization criteria rather than static energy minimization, and of designing new field-driven microscale devices in which components do not slavishly follow the external field."

In both vertebrates and invertebrates, chains of coupled central pattern generators (CPGs) are commonly evoked to explain local rhythmic behaviors. In C. elegans, we report that proprioception within the motor circuit is responsible for propagating and coordinating rhythmic undulatory waves from head to tail during forward movement. Proprioceptive coupling between adjacent body regions transduces rhythmic movement initiated near the head into bending waves driven along the body by a chain of reflexes. Using optogenetics and calcium imaging to manipulate and monitor motor circuit activity of moving C. elegans held in microfluidic devices, we found that the B-type cholinergic motor neurons transduce the proprioceptive signal. In C. elegans, a sensorimotor feedback loop operating within a specific type of motor neuron both drives and organizes body movement."

In the hippocampus, pyramidal cells in CA1 and the subiculum process sensory and motor cues to form a cognitive map encoding spatial, contextual, and emotional information, which they transmit throughout the brain. Do these cells constitute a single class or are there multiple cell types with specialized functions? Using unbiased cluster analysis, we show that there are two morphologically and electrophysiologically distinct principal cell types that carry hippocampal output. We show further that these two cell types are inversely modulated by the synergistic action of glutamate and acetylcholine acting on metabotropic receptors that are central to hippocampal function. Combined with prior connectivity studies, our results support a model of hippocampal processing in which the two pyramidal cell types are predominantly segregated into two parallel pathways that process distinct modalities of information.

Two morphologically and physiologically distinct hippocampal pyramidal cell types Glutamate and acetylcholine control output via each cell type Cell types exhibit differential plasticity: countermodulation by mGluRs and mAChRs Distinct cell types enable functional specialization of hippocampal output An emerging paradigm in cellular neuroscience is to understand the function of the brain in terms of individual neurons that can be grouped into distinct types based on a variety of properties. These properties of distinct cell types affect how they process information, thus enabling functional specialization within neuronal networks. A major determinant of how neurons integrate information is the shape of their dendrites (Häusser et al., 2000Häusser M. Spruston N. Stuart G.J. Diversity and dynamics of dendritic signaling.Science. 2000; 290: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar; Mel, 1994Mel B.W. Information processing in dendritic trees.Neural Comput. 1994; 6: 1031-1085Crossref Google Scholar). For example, Purkinje cells and stellate cells have vastly different dendritic arbors that process synaptic inputs in the cerebellum differently, and in simulations of cortical pyramidal cells, even modest manipulations of dendritic architecture result in altered patterns of action potential output (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1996Mainen Z.F. Sejnowski T.J. Influence of dendritic structure on firing pattern in model neocortical neurons.Nature. 1996; 382: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Cells with different electrophysiological properties also perform distinct computations. For instance, fast-spiking interneurons and adapting interneurons respond to synaptic input in fundamentally different ways that strongly shape how these signals are processed in the cortex (Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005Yoshimura Y. Callaway E.M. Fine-scale specificity of cortical networks depends on inhibitory cell type and connectivity.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1552-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The connectivity of cells within neuronal circuits also influences processing, as with the magnocellular and parvocellular pathways in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, which form separate, parallel streams of visual information that project to segregated areas of visual cortex (Livingstone and Hubel, 1988Livingstone M. Hubel D. Segregation of form, color, movement, and depth: anatomy, physiology, and perception.Science. 1988; 240: 740-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (2277) Google Scholar). Neuromodulation also strongly influences the behavior of distinct cell types. For example, in the basal ganglia, two populations of medium spiny neurons that are defined by their expression of the D1 or D2 dopamine receptor form the direct and indirect pathways, which facilitate and inhibit movement, respectively (Surmeier et al., 2007Surmeier D.J. Ding J. Day M. Wang Z. Shen W. D1 and D2 dopamine-receptor modulation of striatal glutamatergic signaling in striatal medium spiny neurons.Trends Neurosci. 2007; 30: 228-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Thus, investigation of the morphology, electrophysiology, circuitry, and modulation of individual neurons can identify the different cell types within neuronal circuits and elucidate their distinct roles in processing information in the brain. The hippocampus is the cradle of cognition—a brain structure critically involved in the formation, organization, and retrieval of new memories. The principal cell type in this region is the excitatory pyramidal neuron—one of the most-studied cells in the mammalian brain—which integrates spatial, contextual, and emotional information and transmits all hippocampal output to various targets throughout the brain. Pyramidal cells in the CA1 and subiculum regions convey this output by firing action potentials either individually or in high-frequency bursts. These distinct firing patterns are functionally important, as bursts may serve to increase the reliability of synaptic communication by increasing the probability of evoking a postsynaptic spike (Lisman, 1997Lisman J.E.

Indeed, information processing via bursts has been shown to play a key role in the formation of hippocampus-dependent memories (Xu et al., 2012Xu W. Morishita W. Buckmaster P.S. Pang Z.P.

Despite the functional importance of these different firing patterns, it is not known whether the observed heterogeneity in hippocampal pyramidal cell firing patterns reflects the existence of multiple cell types or a single cell type with variable excitability (Greene and Totterdell, 1997Greene J.R.

Different levels of Ih determine distinct temporal integration in bursting and regular-spiking neurons in rat subiculum.J. Physiol. 2006; 576: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A single cell type would suggest that all pyramidal cells process information similarly, whereas the existence of multiple stable cell types would allow for specialization of these principal cells in hippocampal function. Given the central goal of describing the function of the brain in terms of its different cell types and elucidating the roles of these neuronal classes in complex behavioral tasks, it is important to determine the pyramidal cell types in the hippocampus that may have different roles in information processing, learning, and memory. Here, we show that two distinct cell types constitute hippocampal pyramidal output neurons. We show further that the two cell types are both synergistically modulated by metabotropic glutamate and acetylcholine receptors but with opposite outcomes on long-term neuronal excitability in the two cell types. These two cell types appear to correspond to neurons that have been shown to process predominantly different modalities of information (Hargreaves et al., 2005Hargreaves E.L. Rao G. Lee I.

Spruston N. Target-specific output patterns are predicted by the distribution of regular-spiking and bursting pyramidal neurons in the subiculum.Hippocampus. 2012; 22: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, it was unknown whether these pyramidal cells differed solely in their connectivity or rather constituted two distinct cell types with additional specialized features. Thus, our findings support a model in which the hippocampus functions through parallel processing of separate information streams by two pyramidal cell types with distinct dendritic morphology, electrophysiological properties, and different modulatory responses to neurotransmitters that are central to hippocampal function and disease (Bear et al., 2004Bear M.F.

We studied the morphological and electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 and subiculum regions in acute slices of the rat hippocampus.

Physiol. 2006; 576: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suprathreshold step current injections evoked one of two firing patterns: regular spiking or bursting (Figures 1A and 1B ). To determine whether these two response patterns arise from separate classes of pyramidal cells or whether they represent a single population of cells spanning a continuum of excitability, we measured electrophysiological properties using current-clamp recordings and made post hoc anatomical reconstructions of the recorded cells (see Experimental Procedures). We examined the distribution of over 30 electrophysiological and morphological properties in a large population of pyramidal cells (n = 268, Figures 1C–1E and Table 1). If regular-spiking and bursting cells were indeed separate neuronal classes, we would expect to see multimodal distributions of some properties, versus unimodal distributions for a single class. When we examined the distribution of several electrophysiological and morphological properties (Figures 1D and 1E), we found that these properties deviated significantly from a normal distribution and were poorly fit by single Gaussian functions, suggesting that there may be multiple classes of pyramidal cells throughout CA1 and the subiculum.Table 1Properties of Hippocampal Pyramidal CellsRegular SpikingBurstingp ValueElectrophysiologyRN55.0 ± 3.1 MΩ33.7 ± 2.0 MΩ<0.001Sag ratio0.84 ± 0.020.74 ± 0.02<0.001Subthreshold dV/dt2.61mV/ms ± 0.53mV/ms4.39mV/ms ± 0.49mV/ms<0.001ADP amplitude17.9mV ± 1.3mV22.2mV ± 0.9mV<0.001Second spike threshold−40.8mV ± 0.7mV−45.1mV ± 0.9mV<0.001Max second falling dV/dt−56mV/ms ± 3mV/ms−65mV/ms ± 3mV/ms<0.01Max second rising dV/dt240mV/ms ± 24mV/ms272mV/ms ± 22mV/ms<0.05First spike FWHM0.87 ± 0.01 ms0.82 ± 0.02 ms<0.05Resting membrane potential−65.8mV ± 0.7mV−66.2mV ± 0.4mVn.s.First spike threshold−53.1mV ± 1.0mV−52.4mV ± 0.6mVn.s.Max first spike rising dV/dt460mV/ms ± 21mV/ms488mV/ms ± 21mV/msn.s.Max first spike falling dV/dt−106mV/ms ± 4mV/ms−113mV/ms ± 5mV/msn.s.Second spike FWHM1.18 ± 0.03 ms1.14 ± 0.04 msn.s.First spike height92.0mV ± 1.5mV90.3mV ± 1.6mVn.s.Second spike height71.3mV ± 3.0mV70.0mV ± 2.3mVn.s.AHP amplitude−1.29mV ± 0.25mV−1.39mV ± 0.31mVn.s.MorphologyTotal tuft dendrite length1.39 ± 0.02 mm1.49 ± 0.03 mm<0.01Total basal dendrite length3.89 ± 0.26 mm3.08 ± 0.17 mm<0.01Basal branching order4.40 ± 0.263.29 ± 0.23<0.01Distance to main bifurcation193.8 ± 19.3 μm264.4 ± 22.8 μm<0.05Basal branch points50.1 ± 3.840.9 ± 3.1<0.05Tuft branch points33.7 ± 2.841.6 ± 3.3<0.05Apical branching order4.91 ± 0.727.93 ± 1.48<0.05Proximal apical dendrite length1.76 ± 0.21 mm1.35 ± 0.14 mmn.s.Middle apical dendrite length1.67 ± 0.28 mm1.48 ± 0.16 mmn.s.Proximal apical branching order5.53 ± 0.474.98 ± 0.36n.s.Middle apical branching order4.81 ± 0.324.16 ± 0.40n.s.Proximal apical branch points25.0 ± 3.428.0 ± 2.6n.s.Middle apical branch points33.7 ± 1.934.6 ± 3.2n.s.Basal branches off soma3.90 ± 0.473.65 ± 0.39n.s.Mean ± SEM for all values.

To determine the number of pyramidal cell types throughout CA1 and the subiculum, we performed an unbiased K-means cluster analysis (Efron and Tibshirani, 1986Efron B. Tibshirani R.

Stat. Assoc. 2003; 98: 750-763Crossref Scopus (592) Google Scholar) using 15 electrophysiological and morphological properties (see Experimental Procedures). Using all CA1 and subicular pyramidal neurons (n = 110 cells), K-means cluster analysis revealed two completely nonoverlapping groups of cells (Figure 2A), which aligned perfectly with the two step current-induced firing patterns (Figure 2B). We did not find evidence of more than two clusters, subgroups within either the regular-spiking or bursting populations, or separation of CA1 and subicular neurons within either of the two clusters (Figures 2C and 2D). A bootstrap analysis (see Experimental Procedures and Sugar and James, 2003Sugar C.A. James G.M. Finding the number of clusters in a dataset: an information-theoretic approach.J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 2003; 98: 750-763Crossref Scopus (592) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the data are best represented by two clusters (see Figure S1 available online). Furthermore, a principal component analysis revealed that the first three principal components produced perfect separation of the regular-spiking and bursting cell types (Figure 2E). Finally, a plot of only two properties (one physiological and one morphological) reveals a large degree of separation between the two cell types (Figure 2F). Taken together, these results strongly indicate the presence of two (and not more) distinct classes of pyramidal neurons, with each cell type present in both CA1 and the subiculum. These regular-spiking and bursting cell types differ not only in their firing patterns, but also in several additional properties (Figure 3 and Table 1). There are clear morphological differences between the two cell types: bursting cells have more extensive tuft dendrites (the distal third of the apical tree), whereas regular-spiking cells have more extensive basal dendrites (Figures 3A–3C). Regular-spiking cells also have a higher input resistance (RN), a smaller postspike afterdepolarization (ADP), a more depolarized bursting threshold, as well as several other electrophysiological differences, relative to bursting cells (Figure 3D and Table 1). The morphological differences in particular suggest that the regular-spiking and bursting populations do not reflect transient variance in excitability (Babadi, 2005Babadi B. Bursting as an effective relay mode in a minimal thalamic model.J. Comput. Neurosci. 2005; 18: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar; Beurrier et al., 1999Beurrier C. Congar P. Bioulac B. Hammond C. Subthalamic nucleus neurons switch from single-spike activity to burst-firing mode.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 599-609PubMed Google Scholar), but rather that the two populations are discrete, stable cell types. As both of these cell types have characteristic pyramidal cell morphology and electrophysiological properties, and as we show that they are both immunopositive for a glutamatergic marker (the excitatory amino acid transporter 3, EAAT-3) and negative for a marker of GABAergic neurons (glutamic acid decarboxylase 2, GAD-2), these cell types are clearly both excitatory pyramidal neurons (Figure S2). To further investigate the properties of these two types of neurons, we evoked action potential firing using trains of brief excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC)-like current injections (Moore et al., 2009Moore S.J. Cooper D.C. Spruston N. Plasticity of burst firing induced by synergistic activation of metabotropic glutamate and acetylcholine receptors.Neuron. 2009; 61: 287-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All neurons studied in this way responded with a mixture of single spikes and bursts, but the two cell types were readily distinguishable based on the temporal pattern of bursting. Regular-spiking neurons responded with single spikes early in the train and bursts later, whereas bursting neurons fired bursts early in the train and single spikes later (Figures 4A and 4B ). As both types of neurons can and do elicit bursts, the present nomenclature for the observed physiological heterogeneity is misleading. Therefore, we introduce a new nomenclature: late-bursting (previously “regular-spiking”) and early-bursting (previously “bursting”) pyramidal neurons. Although we chose names based on their bursting patterns in response to trains of inputs, there are many additional differences between the two cell types (summarized in Table 2).Table 2Summary of Cell-Type DifferencesLate-Bursting CellsEarly-Bursting CellsBursts late in trainBursts early in trainRegular spiking at thresholdBursting at thresholdSmall ADPLarge ADPHigh burst thresholdLow burst thresholdHigh input resistanceLow input resistanceDense basal dendritesSparse basal dendritesSparse tuft dendritesDense tuft dendritesmGluR5 mediates enhanced burstingmGluR1/mAChR mediate enhanced burstingmGluR1/mAChR mediate suppressed burstingmGluR5 mediates suppressed bursting Open table in a new tab We studied the long-lasting modulation of pyramidal cell firing patterns using synaptic theta-burst stimulation (TBS)—a commonly used plasticity-induction protocol that mimics hippocampal activity in vivo during spatial exploration and other learning tasks. To establish a normative baseline prior to plasticity induction, we adjusted the somatic current injection amplitude to elicit on average four bursts out of ten inputs per train during the baseline period and held this amplitude constant for the duration of the experiment. After measuring neuronal output by counting the number of bursts elicited by each train during a 10 min baseline period, we delivered TBS (see Experimental Procedures) and measured the ensuing changes in bursting. Because neuronal output in response to somatic current injection is controlled by activation of intrinsic voltage-gated or Ca2+-activated ion channels, changes in the number of burst responses were a measure of altered intrinsic postsynaptic excitability. Expanding on previous work focusing on early-bursting cells (Moore et al., 2009Moore S.J. Cooper D.C. Spruston N. Plasticity of burst firing induced by synergistic activation of metabotropic glutamate and acetylcholine receptors.Neuron. 2009; 61: 287-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we found that both types of neurons throughout CA1 and the subiculum displayed a long-lasting increase in bursting after synaptic TBS in normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (Figures 4C–4E and Figure S3). As shown for a representative late-bursting neuron in CA1 and an early-bursting neuron in the subiculum, four bursts were elicited during the baseline period (Figure 4A) and nine bursts were elicited by the same stimulus after TBS (Figure 4C). This plasticity of bursting (“burst plasticity”) was activity dependent—in the absence of synaptic TBS, the level of bursting did not change over the course of 50 min (Figure S3A). We investigated the pharmacology of burst plasticity induction in the two cell types throughout CA1 and the subiculum. We found that the induction of burst plasticity in both cell types did not require activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors or GABAA and GABAB receptors (Figures S3B and S3C). Rather, plasticity induction depended on selective activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). Interestingly, the two types of neurons differed strikingly in their response to the activation of specific subtypes of receptors (Figure 4F and Figures S3D–S3K). Activation of mGluR5 (by delivering synaptic TBS while blocking mAChR alone, mGluR1 alone, or both receptors together) enhanced bursting in late-bursting neurons but decreased bursting in early-bursting neurons; adding an mGluR5 antagonist blocked both of these effects. On the other hand, coactivation of mGluR1 and mAChR (by synaptic TBS while blocking mGluR5 alone) decreased bursting in late-bursting neurons but enhanced bursting in early-bursting neurons; adding antagonists of either mGluR1 or mAChR blocked both of these effects. The ability of antagonists of either mGluR1 or mAChR to completely block one direction of burst plasticity in each cell type (decreased bursting in late-bursting and enhanced bursting in early-bursting neurons) suggests that these two receptor types mediate their effects via a synergistic action (i.e., activating mGluR1 or mAChR alone has no effect). As we observed a difference between the TBS with an mGluR5 antagonist and the TBS with mGluR5 and mGluR1/mAChR antagonists, we conclude that activation of mGluR1/mAChR is necessary for these effects, but we cannot rule out a requirement for activation of additional receptors of unknown identity. Taken together, these experiments illustrate that early-bursting and late-bursting cells are countermodulated: activation of mGluRs increased bursting in one class and decreased it in the other, while mAChRs influenced this plasticity further. These differences in plasticity of intrinsic excitability thus extend the differences between the two cell types (Table 2). The observation that synaptic TBS differentially modulates bursting in a cell-type-dependent manner raises an intriguing question: does burst plasticity interconvert the two cell types? To test whether enhancement of bursting converts late-bursting cells to early-bursting cells, we modified the experimental paradigm in order to investigate the pharmacology of burst plasticity in a late-bursting neuron after the induction of enhanced bursting. Specifically, the enhancement was saturated by repeatedly delivering synaptic TBS every 10 min in normal ACSF. To ensure that bursting was indeed saturated and was not due to a ceiling effect of using only ten inputs, we used trains of 30 somatic current injections. During the baseline period, the amplitude of these injections was set to elicit approximately four bursts per train of 30 inputs. Repeated synaptic TBS epochs caused a much larger increase in bursting than a single TBS (Figures 5A–5D), suggesting that burst plasticity is graded. In addition, repeated induction stimuli eventually failed to enhance bursting further, suggesting that burst plasticity can be saturated. In a separate set of cells, after burst plasticity was saturated, the mGluR5-selective antagonist MPEP was applied to the bath, and a final synaptic TBS stimulus was delivered in the presence of MPEP. If saturating levels of plasticity had converted the late-bursting cell to an early-bursting cell, we would expect to see no effect of TBS in MPEP, as blocking mGluR5 did not affect enhanced bursting in early-bursting cells (see summary in Figure 4F). However, if the late-bursting cell retained its original pharmacology (i.e., did not switch to an early-bursting cell), we would expect to see a reduction of bursting after TBS in MPEP. Indeed, the latter possibility was observed, as a single TBS in MPEP decreased bursting in late-bursting cells after the enhancement of bursting was induced (Figure 5E). This finding suggests that burst plasticity does not serve to interconvert the two cell types and further supports the notion that there are two stable pathways for information processing and output from the hippocampus, each dominated by a separate pyramidal cell type.

Complex IV also contained Rcf1p. No supercomplexes were formed upon mixing of the purified complexes, and low amounts of the supercomplex trimer III2IV1 were formed after reconstitution into proteoliposomes containing only phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine.

Both trimer and tetramer formations were restored by cardiolipin. Analysis of the reconstituted tetramer by single particle electron microscopy confirmed native organization of individual complexes within the supercomplex. In conclusion, although some trimer formation occurred dependent only on tightly bound cardiolipin, tetramer formation required additional cardiolipin. This is consistent with the high cardiolipin content in the native tetramer.

https://openalex.org/W1973641567,"Background Many sub-Saharan countries, including Ghana, have introduced policies to provide free medical care to pregnant women. The impact of these policies, particularly on access to health services among the poor, has not been evaluated using rigorous methods, and so the empirical basis for defending these policies is weak. In Ghana, a recent report also cast doubt on the current mechanism of delivering free care – the National Health Insurance Scheme. Longitudinal surveillance data from two randomized controlled trials conducted in the Brong Ahafo Region provided a unique opportunity to assess the impact of Ghana’s policies. Methods We used time-series methods to assess the impact of Ghana’s 2005 policy on free delivery care and its 2008 policy on free national health insurance for pregnant women. We estimated their impacts on facility delivery and insurance coverage, and on socioeconomic differentials in these outcomes after controlling for temporal trends and seasonality. Results Facility delivery has been increasing significantly over time. The 2005 and 2008 policies were associated with significant jumps in coverage of 2.3% (p = 0.015) and 7.5% (p<0.001), respectively after the policies were introduced. Health insurance coverage also jumped significantly (17.5%, p<0.001) after the 2008 policy. The increases in facility delivery and insurance were greatest among the poorest, leading to a decline in socioeconomic inequality in both outcomes. Conclusion Providing free care, particularly through free health insurance, has been effective in increasing facility delivery overall in the Brong Ahafo Region, and especially among the poor. This finding should be considered when evaluating the impact of the National Health Insurance Scheme and in supporting the continuation and expansion of free delivery care."
https://openalex.org/W2088827979,"Osteoclasts play a key role in the development of cancer-associated osteolytic lesions. The number and activity of osteoclasts are often enhanced by tumors. However, the origin of osteoclasts is unknown. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are one of the pre-metastatic niche components that are induced to expand by tumor cells. Here we show that the MDSCs can differentiate into mature and functional osteoclasts in vitro and in vivo. Inoculation of 5TGM1-GFP myeloma cells into C57BL6/KaLwRij mice led to a significant expansion of MDSCs in blood, spleen, and bone marrow over time. When grown in osteoclastogenic media in vitro, MDSCs from tumor-challenged mice displayed 14 times greater potential to differentiate into mature and functional osteoclasts than those from non-tumor controls. Importantly, MDSCs from tumor-challenged LacZ transgenic mice differentiated into LacZ+osteoclasts in vivo. Furthermore, a significant increase in tumor burden and bone loss accompanied by increased number of osteoclasts was observed in mice co-inoculated with tumor-challenged MDSCs and 5TGM1 cells compared to the control animals received 5TGM1 cells alone. Finally, treatment of MDSCs from myeloma-challenged mice with Zoledronic acid (ZA), a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, inhibited the number of osteoclasts formed in MDSC cultures and the expansion of MDSCs and bone lesions in mice. Collectively, these data provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that tumor-induced MDSCs exacerbate cancer-associated bone destruction by directly serving as osteoclast precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1992559568,"Pluto and Eris are icy dwarf planets with nearly identical sizes, comparable densities and similar surface compositions as revealed by spectroscopic studies. Pluto possesses an atmosphere whereas Eris does not; the difference probably arises from their differing distances from the Sun, and explains their different albedos. Makemake is another icy dwarf planet with a spectrum similar to Eris and Pluto, and is currently at a distance to the Sun intermediate between the two. Although Makemake's size (1,420 ± 60 km) and albedo are roughly known, there has been no constraint on its density and there were expectations that it could have a Pluto-like atmosphere. Here we report the results from a stellar occultation by Makemake on 2011 April 23. Our preferred solution that fits the occultation chords corresponds to a body with projected axes of 1,430 ± 9 km (1σ) and 1,502 ± 45 km, implying a V-band geometric albedo p(V) = 0.77 ± 0.03. This albedo is larger than that of Pluto, but smaller than that of Eris. The disappearances and reappearances of the star were abrupt, showing that Makemake has no global Pluto-like atmosphere at an upper limit of 4-12 nanobar (1σ) for the surface pressure, although a localized atmosphere is possible. A density of 1.7 ± 0.3 g cm(-3) is inferred from the data."
https://openalex.org/W2044301540,"Urban domestic cat (Felis catus) populations can attain exceedingly high densities and are not limited by natural prey availability. This has generated concerns that they may negatively affect prey populations, leading to calls for management. We enlisted cat-owners to record prey returned home to estimate patterns of predation by free-roaming pets in different localities within the town of Reading, UK and questionnaire surveys were used to quantify attitudes to different possible management strategies. Prey return rates were highly variable: only 20% of cats returned ≥4 dead prey annually. Consequently, approximately 65% of owners received no prey in a given season, but this declined to 22% after eight seasons. The estimated mean predation rate was 18.3 prey cat⁻¹ year⁻¹ but this varied markedly both spatially and temporally: per capita predation rates declined with increasing cat density. Comparisons with estimates of the density of six common bird prey species indicated that cats killed numbers equivalent to adult density on c. 39% of occasions. Population modeling studies suggest that such predation rates could significantly reduce the size of local bird populations for common urban species. Conversely, most urban residents did not consider cat predation to be a significant problem. Collar-mounted anti-predation devices were the only management action acceptable to the majority of urban residents (65%), but were less acceptable to cat-owners because of perceived risks to their pets; only 24% of cats were fitted with such devices. Overall, cat predation did appear to be of sufficient magnitude to affect some prey populations, although further investigation of some key aspects of cat predation is warranted. Management of the predation behavior of urban cat populations in the UK is likely to be challenging and achieving this would require considerable engagement with cat owners."
https://openalex.org/W2095445167,"Axons must switch responsiveness to guidance cues during development for correct pathfinding. Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) attracts spinal cord commissural axons ventrally toward the floorplate. We show that after crossing the floorplate, commissural axons switch their response to Shh from attraction to repulsion, so that they are repelled anteriorly by a posterior-high/anterior-low Shh gradient along the longitudinal axis. This switch is recapitulated in vitro with dissociated commissural neurons as they age, indicating that the switch is intrinsic and time dependent. 14-3-3 protein inhibition converted Shh-mediated repulsion of aged dissociated neurons to attraction and prevented the correct anterior turn of postcrossing commissural axons in vivo, an effect mediated through PKA. Conversely, overexpression of 14-3-3 proteins was sufficient to drive the switch from Shh-mediated attraction to repulsion both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we identify a 14-3-3 protein-dependent mechanism for a cell-intrinsic temporal switch in the polarity of axon turning responses."
https://openalex.org/W2059338283,"Background hyaluronan biopolymer is used in dermatology but the underlying mechanism and the impact of its molecular weight have not yet been investigated in skin wound healing. The aim of our work was to study the role of HA molecular weight in the proliferative phase of wound healing and to understand how this physiological biopolymer acts to promote wound healing on a human keratinocyte in vitro model. Methodology and Findings wound healing closure was evaluated using scratch test assay, cell proliferation by counting cell with haemocytometer, expression of CD44 and ZO-1 (protein present in tight junctions specific of epithelia) using flow cytometry, and P2X7 receptor activation on living using a cytoflurometric method. Our study showed that medium hyaluronan fragment (MMW-HA, between 100 and 300 kDa) induced a significant increase in wound closure, increased ZO-1 protein expression and induced a slight activation of P2X7 receptor, contrary to high (between 1000 and 1400 kDa) and low (between 5 and 20 kDa) molecular hyaluronan fragments that had no healing effects. Basal activation of P2X7 receptor is already known to stimulate cell proliferation and this activation in our model plays a pivotal role in MMW-HA-induced wound healing. Indeed, we showed that use of BBG, a specific inhibitor of P2X7 receptor, blocked completely the beneficial effects of MMW-HA on wound healing. Conclusion taken together, our results showed for the first time the relationship between P2X7 receptor and hyaluronan in wound healing, and that topical use of MMW-HA (fragment between 100 and 300 kDa) could represent a new therapeutic strategy to promote healing."
https://openalex.org/W2007810004,"Genetically encoded sensors based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) are powerful tools for reporting on ions, molecules and biochemical reactions in living cells. Here we describe the development of new sensors for Zn2+based on alternate FRET-pairs that do not involve the traditional CFP and YFP. Zn2+ is an essential micronutrient and plays fundamental roles in cell biology. Consequently there is a pressing need for robust sensors to monitor Zn2+ levels and dynamics in cells with high spatial and temporal resolution. Here we develop a suite of sensors using alternate FRET pairs, including tSapphire/TagRFP, tSapphire/mKO, Clover/mRuby2, mOrange2/mCherry, and mOrange2/mKATE. These sensors were targeted to both the nucleus and cytosol and characterized and validated in living cells. Sensors based on the new FRET pair Clover/mRuby2 displayed a higher dynamic range and better signal-to-noise ratio than the remaining sensors tested and were optimal for monitoring changes in cytosolic and nuclear Zn2+. Using a green-red sensor targeted to the nucleus and cyan-yellow sensor targeted to either the ER, Golgi, or mitochondria, we were able to monitor Zn2+ uptake simultaneously in two compartments, revealing that nuclear Zn2+ rises quickly, whereas the ER, Golgi, and mitochondria all sequester Zn2+ more slowly and with a delay of 600–700 sec. Lastly, these studies provide the first glimpse of nuclear Zn2+ and reveal that nuclear Zn2+ is buffered at a higher level than cytosolic Zn2+."
https://openalex.org/W1963873781,"Bacterial biofilms are complex communities of cells containing an increased prevalence of dormant cells known as persisters, which are characterized by an up-regulation of genes known as toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules. The association of toxins with their cognate antitoxins neutralizes toxin activity, allowing for normal cell growth. Additionally, protein antitoxins bind their own promoters and repress transcription, whereas the toxins serve as co-repressors. Recently, TA pairs have been shown to regulate their own transcription through a phenomenon known as conditional cooperativity, where the TA complexes bind operator DNA and repress transcription only when present in the proper stoichiometric amounts. The most differentially up-regulated gene in persister cells is mqsR, a gene that, with the antitoxin mqsA, constitutes a TA module. Here, we reveal that, unlike other TA systems, MqsR is not a transcription co-repressor but instead functions to destabilize the MqsA-DNA complex. We further show that DNA binding is not regulated by conditional cooperativity. Finally, using biophysical studies, we show that complex formation between MqsR and MqsA results in an exceptionally stable interaction, resulting in a subnanomolar dissociation constant that is similar to that observed between MqsA and DNA. In combination with crystallographic studies, this work reveals that MqsA binding to DNA and MqsR is mutually exclusive. To our knowledge, this is the first TA system in which the toxin does not function as a transcriptional co-repressor, but instead functions to destabilize the antitoxin-operator complex under all conditions, and thus defines another unique feature of the mqsRA TA module."

Using in vitro tyrosinase inhibitory activity assay, extracts from 13 plant species from Brazilian Cerrado were evaluated. The results showed that Pouteria torta and Eugenia dysenterica extracts presented potent in vitro tyrosinase inhibition compared to positive control kojic acid. Ethanol extract of Eugenia dysenterica leaves showed significant (p<0.05) tyrosinase inhibitory activity exhibiting the IC₅₀ value of 11.88 µg/mL, compared to kojic acid (IC₅₀ value of 13.14 µg/mL).

These results indicate that Pouteria torta and Eugenia dysenterica extracts and their isolated constituents are promising agents for skin-whitening or antimelanogenesis formulations."
https://openalex.org/W1981002801,"Recent studies from our group suggest that extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and fibrosis characterize the peri-urethral prostate tissues of some men suffering from Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) and that fibrosis may be a contributing factor to the etiology of LUTS. Fibrosis can generally be regarded as an errant wound-healing process in response to chronic inflammation, and several studies have shown that the aging prostate tissue microenvironment is rich with inflammatory cells and proteins. However, it is unclear whether these same inflammatory proteins, particularly CXC-type chemokines, can mediate myofibroblast phenoconversion and the ECM deposition necessary for the development of prostatic tissue fibrosis. To examine this, immortalized and primary prostate stromal fibroblasts treated with TGF-β1, CXCL5, CXCL8, or CXCL12 were evaluated morphologically by microscopy, by immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR for αSMA, collagen 1, vimentin, calponin, and tenascin protein and transcript expression, and by gel contraction assays for functional myofibroblast phenoconversion. The results of these studies showed that that immortalized and primary prostate stromal fibroblasts are induced to express collagen 1 and 3 and αSMA gene transcripts and proteins and to undergo complete and functional myofibroblast phenoconversion in response to CXC-type chemokines, even in the absence of exogenous TGF-β1. Moreover, CXCL12-mediated myofibroblast phenoconversion can be completely abrogated by inhibition of the CXCL12 receptor, CXCR4. These findings suggest that CXC-type chemokines, which comprise inflammatory proteins known to be highly expressed in the aging prostate, can efficiently and completely mediate myofibroblast phenoconversion and may thereby promote fibrotic changes in prostate tissue architecture associated with the development and progression of male lower urinary tract dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1999118478,"Protein lysine acetylation is a type of reversible post-translational modification that plays a vital role in many cellular processes, such as transcriptional regulation, apoptosis and cytokine signaling. To fully decipher the molecular mechanisms of acetylation-related biological processes, an initial but crucial step is the recognition of acetylated substrates and the corresponding acetylation sites. In this study, we developed a position-specific method named PSKAcePred for lysine acetylation prediction based on support vector machines. The residues around the acetylation sites were selected or excluded based on their entropy values. We incorporated features of amino acid composition information, evolutionary similarity and physicochemical properties to predict lysine acetylation sites. The prediction model achieved an accuracy of 79.84% and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 59.72% using the 10-fold cross-validation on balanced positive and negative samples. A feature analysis showed that all features applied in this method contributed to the acetylation process. A position-specific analysis showed that the features derived from the critical neighboring residues contributed profoundly to the acetylation site determination. The detailed analysis in this paper can help us to understand more of the acetylation mechanism and can provide guidance for the related experimental validation."
https://openalex.org/W2047491845,"Global biodiversity losses provide an immediate impetus to elucidate the relationships between biodiversity, productivity and stability. In this study, we quantified the effects of species richness and species combination on the productivity and stability of phytoplankton communities subject to predation by a single rotifer species. We also tested one mechanism of the insurance hypothesis: whether large, slow-growing, potentially-defended cells would compensate for the loss of small, fast-growing, poorly-defended cells after predation. There were significant effects of species richness and species combination on the productivity, relative yield, and stability of phytoplankton cultures, but the relative importance of species richness and combination varied with the response variables. Species combination drove patterns of productivity, whereas species richness was more important for stability. Polycultures containing the most productive single species, Dunaliella, were consistently the most productive. Yet, the most species rich cultures were the most stable, having low temporal variability in measures of biomass. Polycultures recovered from short-term negative grazing effects, but this recovery was not due to the compensation of large, slow-growing cells for the loss of small, fast-growing cells. Instead, polyculture recovery was the result of reduced rotifer grazing rates and persisting small species within the polycultures. Therefore, although an insurance effect in polycultures was found, this effect was indirect and unrelated to grazing tolerance. We hypothesize that diverse phytoplankton assemblages interfered with efficient rotifer grazing and that this “interference effect” facilitated the recovery of the most productive species, Dunaliella. In summary, we demonstrate that both species composition and species richness are important in driving patterns of productivity and stability, respectively, and that stability in biodiverse communities can result from an alteration in consumer functioning. Our findings underscore the importance of predator-prey dynamics in determining the relationships between biodiversity, productivity and stability in producer communities."

Despite the proposed role for HYAL2 in HA degradation, only a deficiency of HYAL1 has been found to cause a human disorder. It causes mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IX, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by joint abnormalities due to HA accumulation (9Natowicz M.R. Short M.P. Wang Y. Dickersin G.R. Gebhardt M.C.

In the heart valves, GAGs are abundant and play important roles in both developing and mature valves (11Armstrong E.J. Bischoff J. Heart valve development: endothelial cell signaling and differentiation.Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 12Hinton R.B. Yutzey K.E. Heart valve structure and function in development and disease.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2011; 73: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). It is not surprising that cardiovascular manifestations are a prominent feature of many forms of MPS that result from GAG accumulation (13Braunlin E.A. Harmatz P.R. Scarpa M. Furlanetto B. Kampmann C. Loehr J.P. Ponder K.P. Roberts W.C. Rosenfeld H.M. Giugliani R. Cardiac disease in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis: presentation, diagnosis and management.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2011; 34: 1183-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). For example, mitral valve thickening and stenosis are found in Hurler and Scheie diseases, and these findings are also reflected in the corresponding mouse model (14Jordan M.C. Zheng Y. Ryazantsev S.

Therefore, defects in ECM-modifying enzymes are among the many causes of cardiovascular disease. HA is one of the major GAGs in heart valves. Surprisingly, no broad-spectrum HA accumulation, including in the heart, was identified during the characterization of Hyal1-, Hyal2-, or Hyal3-deficient mice (15Atmuri V. Martin D.C. Hemming R.

Genet. 2008; 17: 1904-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Previous studies of Hyal2−/− (knock-out (KO)) mice revealed craniofacial abnormalities and chronic anemia, as well as unexplained preweaning lethality (16Jadin L. Wu X. Ding H. Frost G.I. Onclinx C. Triggs-Raine B. Flamion B. Skeletal and hematological anomalies in HYAL2-deficient mice: a second type of mucopolysaccharidosis IX?.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 4316-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, in addition to these features, on an outbred background (C129;CD1;C57BL/6), we have found a gross enlargement of either the left or right atrium in more than half of the Hyal2 KO mice that survived to weaning. Because HA synthesis is known to be essential for normal heart development, we hypothesized that a failure to degrade HA in these mice had resulted in HA accumulation, leading to cardiopulmonary dysfunction and premature death. Hyal2 KO mice were generated as part of a previous study (16Jadin L. Wu X. Ding H. Frost G.I. Onclinx C. Triggs-Raine B. Flamion B. Skeletal and hematological anomalies in HYAL2-deficient mice: a second type of mucopolysaccharidosis IX?.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 4316-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For this study, Hyal2 KO mice and control littermates, either wild type (+/+) or heterozygous (+/−), on an outbred background (C129;CD1;C57BL/6) were derived through breeding of Hyal2 heterozygotes. Mice were genotyped using PCR-based strategies on DNA samples isolated from ear punches. For amplification of wild type Hyal2 and the Neo-targeted Hyal2 allele, we used forward and reverse primers (5′-actcagctgctggttcccta-3′ and 5′-atagcactggcagcgaaagt-3′; 5′-aaggaacatcagggaagatcat-3′ and 5′-cggtgcccgagactaagtc-3′, respectively). All animal procedures were conducted following protocols approved by the University of Manitoba Animal Care Committee and following the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Mice were killed by carbon dioxide inhalation, and tissues for light microscopy were immediately collected and fixed overnight in either formalin or 10% buffered formalin (PROTOCOL) containing 1% hexadecylpyridinium chloride monohydrate. Tissues for subsequent biochemical studies were stored at −80 °C. Fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were stained for morphological analysis using established methods for hematoxylin and eosin (18Allen T.C. Prophet E.B. Mills B. Arrington J.B. Sobin L.H. Laboratory Methods in Histotechnology. American Registry of Pathology, Washington, D.C.1994: 53-58Google Scholar) or for GAG detection using Alcian blue (19Gaffney E. Prophet E.B. Mills B. Arrington J.B. Sobin L.H. Laboratory Methods in Histotechnology. American Registry of Pathology, Washington, D.C.1994: 149-174Google Scholar), with minor modifications in the time of incubation with the stain. Counterstaining for Alcian blue was performed with Nuclear Fast Red (ScyTek Laboratories) for 2.5 min. Heart and lung ECM was stained using Masson's trichrome stain (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Slides were dehydrated, mounted, and visualized using bright-field microscopy. For analysis of hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes, slides were incubated for 30 min with 4 μg/ml wheat germ agglutinin (Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugate), mounted using Prolong Gold (Invitrogen), and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The area of the cardiomyocytes, as defined by binding to wheat germ agglutinin, was measured using AxioVision 4.5 software. A minimum of seven fields, containing an average of eight cells per field, was examined for each animal. The valve and surrounding myocardium were collected by punch biopsy from a whole heart that was sliced using a rodent heart slicer matrix (Zivic Instruments). Tissues were fixed for 4 h at room temperature in 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde prepared in 100 mm sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 0.7% Ruthenium red. After fixation, tissues were washed with buffer containing 100 mm sodium cacodylate, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.7% Ruthenium red, and 0.7% sucrose (pH 7.2) for 5 min, 30 min, and 1 h at room temperature. Tissues were post-fixed for 1 h in 100 mm sodium cacodylate containing 1% osmium tetroxide and 0.7% Ruthenium red, followed by three 10-min washes with double-distilled H2O. Tissues were dehydrated for 10 min each in 50% ethanol, 75% ethanol, 95% ethanol, two changes in 100% ethanol followed by 100% methanol, and three changes in propylene oxide. After dehydration, tissues were infiltrated by incubation in a mixture of propylene oxide and Araldite 502 (58.9:46:2% (w/v) mixture of Araldite, dodecenyl succinic anhydride, and 2,4,6-Tris (dimethylaminomethyl) phenol-30; Ted Pella, Inc.). The infiltration solutions were prepared with propylene oxide and Araldite (3:1, 1:1, and 1:3) and incubated for 1 h each. Slow hardening of the Araldite was performed through 1-day incubations at room temperature, 45 °C, and 60 °C. HA was detected with biotinylated HA-binding protein (HABP; Calbiochem) as described previously (17Martin D.C. Atmuri V. Hemming R.J. Farley J. Mort J.S. Byers S. Hombach-Klonisch S. Csoka A.B. Stern R. Triggs-Raine B.L. A mouse model of human mucopolysaccharidosis IX exhibits osteoarthritis.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 1904-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), except without enzyme retrieval and using HABP (1.67 μg/ml for heart and 6.68 μg/ml for lungs) in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) overnight at 4 °C. Sections were incubated with avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, detected with diaminobenzidine, and counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red. To verify the specificity of HABP, sections were incubated overnight with 25 units/ml HYAL from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus (Sigma) before HABP detection. For detection of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), F4/80, and CD31, the sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal anti-human smooth muscle actin (1:300; Dako), rat monoclonal anti-mouse F4/80 (1:100; AbD Serotec), or rabbit polyclonal anti-CD31 (1:50; Abcam) antibody, respectively. Secondary antibodies (biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse (1:1000; Dako) or goat anti-rat (1:500; Invitrogen)) were used to detect the primary complexes, and complex detection was as described above for HA. For F4/80 and CD31, antigen retrieval was performed by incubating the slides for 20 min at 95 °C in 10 mm sodium citrate (pH 6). Blood was collected from mice immediately following euthanasia or from the saphenous vein of living mice at 6 and 12 weeks. Serum was collected from clotted blood by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min and stored at −80 °C. HA levels were quantified using an ELISA-like HA test plate (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's directions. All samples were analyzed in duplicate, and the average value was used for subsequent comparisons. Fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis was performed for quantification of HA and chondroitin sulfate in tissues (20Gushulak L. Hemming R. Martin D. Seyrantepe V. Pshezhetsky A. Triggs-Raine B. Hyaluronidase 1 and β-hexosaminidase have redundant functions in hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate degradation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 16689-16697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, GAGs isolated from frozen heart tissue by 50 μg/μl proteinase K digestion and ethanol precipitation were cleaved to disaccharide units by overnight incubation with hyaluronidase SD (Seikagaku catalog no. 100741-1) or chondroitinase ABC (Sigma-Aldrich) in 200 mm ammonium acetate. The disaccharides were isolated, labeled with 2-aminoacridone, and quantified in comparison with known disaccharide standards as described previously (21Plaas A.H. West L. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. Disaccharide composition of hyaluronan and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate. Analysis with fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis.Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 117-128PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence was detected using the Fluor-S Max MultiImager (Bio-Rad) and quantified using Quantity One 4.6.9 software (Bio-Rad). For sizing of HA, GAGs were prepared from tissue (10–15 mg) or serum (200–400 μl) as for fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis, except 5 mm deferoxamine was included in the proteinase K digestion, and a 4-h incubation at 37 °C with 10 units of DNase I and 50 μg of RNase A was incorporated after destroying the proteinase K by boiling. Instead of digesting the GAGs to disaccharides, they were enriched by precipitation with 1% hexadecylpyridinium chloride monohydrate as described previously (22Gordon L.B. Harten I.A. Calabro A. Sugumaran G. Csoka A.B. Brown W.T. Hascall V. Toole B.P. Hyaluronan is not elevated in urine or serum in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.Hum. Genet. 2003; 113: 178-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet was then resuspended in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and Pronase was added to 0.2 mg/ml. Following overnight incubation, the GAGs were precipitated with 900 μl of 100% ethanol. The final pellet was resuspended in 15 μl of water, 3 μl of Orange G tracking dye was added, and the sample was separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel prepared in Tris acetate buffer (pH 8.3). The gel was stained overnight with 0.005% Stains-all prepared in 50% ethanol, destained with 10% ethanol until the bands were clearly visible, and photographed. Negative control samples to verify the identity of the HA were prepared by incubating the GAGs overnight with 2.5 units of hyaluronidase SD before they were analyzed by electrophoresis. The genotype distributions were compared with the expected Mendelian ratios using the χ2 test. For all other statistical analysis, data are presented as means ± S.E. Means were compared by Student's t test. p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We obtained viable Hyal2 KO mice by intercrossing Hyal2 heterozygotes (+/−); although as reported previously (16Jadin L. Wu X. Ding H. Frost G.I. Onclinx C. Triggs-Raine B. Flamion B. Skeletal and hematological anomalies in HYAL2-deficient mice: a second type of mucopolysaccharidosis IX?.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 4316-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), preweaning lethality was observed. In fact, only ∼9% (70 of 789) of the offspring were Hyal2 KOs at weaning instead of the expected Mendelian 25% (χ22 = 109.86; p < 0.001). Of the viable Hyal2 KO mice, 54% were smaller in size than their littermates and exhibited rapid onset lethargy, weight loss, dull coat, and shortness of breath requiring euthanasia at an average of 3.2 months of age. Upon dissection, the left or right atrium of these mice was grossly dilated (Fig. 1). The remaining 46% of Hyal2 KO mice developed a slower onset lethargy, loss of weight, and poor grooming that required euthanasia at an average of 5.8 months of age. Severe atrial dilation was not found in these mice or in control littermates (Hyal2+/+/Hyal2+/−). However, one kidney was found to be missing in 1% of control mice and 43% (n = 29) of Hyal2 KO mice, suggesting that this phenotype is increased by Hyal2 deficiency. The kidney phenotype was not further investigated, as it was found to be independent of the atrial dilation. For the studies described herein, the Hyal2 KO mice were divided into two categories: mice with atrial dilation were defined as “acute,” and those without atrial dilation were defined as “non-acute.” The atrial dilation in the acute Hyal2 KO mice, together with the knowledge that HA is abundant in the heart valve, led us to look for a valve abnormality in the Hyal2 KO mice. H&E staining revealed a profound expansion of the pulmonary, mitral, aortic, and tricuspid valves in all mice that were examined (n = 9) compared with control littermates (n = 7). Representative sections of the pulmonary and mitral valves are shown in Fig. 2 (A–D). To determine whether there was any difference in the expansion of the valves in the acute and non-acute Hyal2 KO mice, we compared the expansion/length of the valve leaflet/cups by determining the number of serial sections that included each valve. The valve thickness was significantly greater in Hyal2 KO mice than in control mice, but there was no significant difference between acute and non-acute Hyal2 KO mice (Fig. 2E). To determine whether HA was accumulating in the Hyal2 KO mice, we used HABP to detect HA. Abundant HA was found throughout the valves (Fig. 3, A–J), and given the expanded size of the valves in the Hyal2 KO mice, this indicates that HA was accumulating in the Hyal2 KO valves. To determine whether the accumulating HA was altering the organization of the ECM of the valve, we examined ECM components using Masson's trichrome stain. Compared with normal valves (Fig. 4B), those from Hyal2 KO mice were disorganized, with GAGs (white material) deposited between the collagen fibers in the fibrosa and ventricularis/atrialis layers, respectively, and resulting in an expanded spongiosa layer (Fig. 4A). Endothelial cells in the valve were identified by staining for the endothelial marker CD31. The CD31-positive cells (brown) appeared less frequently in the Hyal2 KO valve, probably because these cells were stretched over the extended surface area of the expanded valve (Fig. 4, C and D). These findings indicate that the accumulated HA in the ECM of Hyal2 KO mice leads to the expansion, thickening, and disorganization of the valve leaflet/cups. We also examined the structure of the atrial and ventricular myocardium of acute and non-acute Hyal2 KO mice and control mice for additional pathologies. Staining for total GAG with Alcian blue revealed accumulation of interstitial GAGs between the atrial cardiac myocytes (Fig. 5, A, C, and E). This staining was more prominent in the acute Hyal2 KO mice than in the non-acute Hyal2 KO mice and was always stronger in Hyal2 KO mice than in control mice, indicating that GAGs were accumulating in the KO mice. In adjacent serial sections, HA was found to be abundant in the ECM of the acute mice compared with both the non-acute and control mice (Fig. 5, B, D, and F), providing further evidence that HA was accumulating in the Hyal2 KO mice. To determine whether there were additional abnormalities in the cardiac myocytes of Hyal2 KO mice, sections were stained with fluorescently labeled wheat germ agglutinin, and the sizes of the cardiomyocytes were determined. Significant cardiac hypertrophy was found in the upper ventricular region, close to the base of the heart, of acute Hyal2 KO mice compared with control mice (Fig. 6A), but this hypertrophy did not reach significance in the lower ventricular region of acute Hyal2 KO mice (Fig. 6B) or non-acute Hyal2 KO mice (Fig. 6, C and D). To further characterize the changes in the Hyal2 KO hearts, we performed transmission electron microscopy on the valves and the ventricular and atrial myocardium. In the control valves (Fig. 7E), the ECM was densely packed with collagen fibrils, whereas in the Hyal2 KO valves (Fig. 7A), the ECM separated the collagen fibrils. The accumulated material in the Hyal2 KO valves was clearly extracellular and was presumed to be HA. The atrial myocardium of Hyal2 KO mice (Fig. 7, B and C) contained cardiomyocytes, which showed a disorganized arrangement of myofibrils and mitochondria and a substantial reduction in myofibrils. In contrast, the atrial cardiomyocytes of control mice showed a sarcoplasm with tightly packed myofibrils and mitochondria (Fig. 7, F and G). Within the ventricular myocardium, we observed cardiomyocytes with a disorganized arrangement of myofibrils and mitochondria and a more loosely packed sarcoplasm (Fig. 7D) compared with controls (Fig. 7H). To look for additional differences in acute, non-acute, and control mice that might be related to atrial dilation, we examined the lungs. A dramatic difference between the acute and non-acute Hyal2 KO lungs was identified. The alveoli were reduced, and the alveolar septa were thickened in the acute Hyal2 KO mice compared with the non-acute and control mice (Fig. 8, A–C). Further, Masson's trichrome staining revealed increased collagen in the alveolar septa of the acute mice that was absent in both the non-acute and control mice (Fig. 8, D–F). Further investigation of the thickened alveolar septa using anti-α-SMA immunostaining revealed a strong signal for α-SMA in the alveolar interstitium of acute mice that was not detected in the lungs of non-acute and control mice (Fig. 8, G–I). Increased levels of HA were also detected in the lungs of acute and non-acute Hyal2 KO mice compared with control mice (Fig. 8, J–L), although the levels were much higher in the acutely affected animals. Therefore, pathology typical of severe pulmonary fibrosis was present only in the acute Hyal2 KO mice. We observed numerous alveolar macrophages (foam cells) in the inter- and intra-alveolar spaces of acute and, to a lesser extent, non-acute Hyal2 KO mice (Fig. 8, A and B) compared with control mice, suggesting that the accumulation of HA led to the recruitment of macrophages to the lung parenchyma. To confirm that these infiltrating cells were macrophages, we used an antibody against F4/80 (Fig. 8, M–O). A deficiency of HYAL2 had already been demonstrated to lead to increased serum HA (16Jadin L. Wu X. Ding H. Frost G.I. Onclinx C. Triggs-Raine B. Flamion B. Skeletal and hematological anomalies in HYAL2-deficient mice: a second type of mucopolysaccharidosis IX?.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 4316-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As expected, we found the levels of HA to be ∼19-fold higher in Hyal2 KO mice compared with control mice at 12 weeks (Fig. 9A). The levels of HA increased with age in the Hyal2 KO mice, reaching an average 27-fold increase at the time of euthanasia (Fig. 9A). Interestingly, the levels of serum HA were elevated in both acute and non-acute Hyal2 KO animals, indicating that differences in the levels of circulating HA are unlikely to be the cause of the more severe phenotype in acute Hyal2 KO animals. We also quantified the levels of HA in the hearts and lungs of Hyal2 KO mice using fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis. Consistent with the detection of increased HA by immunohistochemistry, elevated levels of HA were found in Hyal2 KO hearts and lungs compared with control mice (Fig. 9, B and C). No significant difference between the levels of HA in non-acute and acute Hyal2 KO mice was detected in the heart (Fig. 7B). The HA levels also appeared similar in the lungs of acute and non-acute Hyal2 KO mice, but our sample size was not large enough for statistical analysis. We also examined the chondroitin sulfate levels in the heart by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis, and no significant difference between Hyal2 KO (0.91 ± 0.17 ng/mg) and control (0.77 ± 0.12 ng/mg) mice was found (n = 4; p = 0.51). Given the predicted role of HYAL2 in initiating the degradation of HA by cleavage of high molecular mass HA to smaller fragments for internalization, we expected that the HA found in the tissues of Hyal2 KO mice would have a larger molecular mass than that in control animals. To assess this, HA was partially purified from the sera and hearts"
https://openalex.org/W2019173591,"An important organizing feature of the CNS is that individual neurons receive input from many different sources. Independent regulation of synaptic input is critical for the function and adaptive responses of the nervous system, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We identify the leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing protein NGL-2 (Lrrc4) as a key regulator of input-specific synapse development in the hippocampus. Using genetic deletion and shRNA-mediated knockdown, we demonstrate a role for NGL-2 in regulating the strength of synaptic transmission and spine density specifically at Schaffer collateral synapses in the stratum radiatum (SR) in CA1. NGL-2 protein is restricted to SR and spine regulation requires NGL-2's LRR and PDZ-binding domains. Finally, loss of NGL-2 disrupts cooperative interactions between distal and proximal synapses in CA1 pyramidal cells. These results demonstrate that NGL-2 is critical for pathway-specific synapse development and functional integration of distinct inputs."
https://openalex.org/W1996112949,"Monitoring vegetation dynamics and their responses to climate change has been the subject of considerable research. This paper aims to detect change trends in grassland activity on the Tibetan Plateau between 1982 and 2006 and relate these to changes in climate.Grassland activity was analyzed by evaluating remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data collected at 15-day intervals between 1982 and 2006. The timings of vegetation stages (start of green-up, beginning of the growing season, plant maturity, start of senescence and end of the growing season) were assessed using the NDVI ratio method. Mean NDVI values were determined for major vegetation stages (green-up, fast growth, maturity and senescence). All vegetation variables were linked with datasets of monthly temperature and precipitation, and correlations between variables were established using Partial Least Squares regression. Most parts of the Tibetan Plateau showed significantly increasing temperatures, as well as clear advances in late season phenological stages by several weeks. Rainfall trends and significant long-term changes in early season phenology occurred on small parts of the plateau. Vegetation activity increased significantly for all vegetation stages. Most of these changes were related to increasing temperatures during the growing season and in some cases during the previous winter. Precipitation effects appeared less pronounced. Warming thus appears to have shortened the growing season, while increasing vegetation activity.Shortening of the growing season despite a longer thermally favorable period implies that vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau is unable to exploit additional thermal resources availed by climate change. Ecosystem composition may no longer be well attuned to the local temperature regime, which has changed rapidly over the past three decades. This apparent lag of the vegetation assemblage behind changes in climate should be taken into account when projecting the impacts of climate change on ecosystem processes."
https://openalex.org/W1990739411,"Transmembrane semaphorins (Semas) serve evolutionarily conserved guidance roles, and some function as both ligands and receptors. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transduction of these signals to the cytoskeleton remain largely unknown. We have identified two direct regulators of Rho family small GTPases, pebble (a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor [GEF]) and RhoGAPp190 (a GTPase activating protein [GAP]), that show robust interactions with the cytoplasmic domain of the Drosophila Sema-1a protein. Neuronal pebble and RhoGAPp190 are required to control motor axon defasciculation at specific pathway choice points and also for target recognition during Drosophila neuromuscular development. Sema-1a-mediated motor axon defasciculation is promoted by pebble and inhibited by RhoGAPp190. Genetic analyses show that opposing pebble and RhoGAPp190 functions mediate Sema-1a reverse signaling through the regulation of Rho1 activity. Therefore, pebble and RhoGAPp190 transduce transmembrane semaphorin-mediated guidance cue information that regulates the establishment of neuronal connectivity during Drosophila development."
https://openalex.org/W2075244861,"Developmental gene expression results from the orchestrated interplay between genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Here, we describe upSET, a transcriptional regulator encoding a SET domain-containing protein recruited to active and inducible genes in Drosophila. However, unlike other Drosophila SET proteins associated with gene transcription, UpSET is part of an Rpd3/Sin3-containing complex that restricts chromatin accessibility and histone acetylation to promoter regions. In the absence of UpSET, active chromatin marks and chromatin accessibility increase and spread to genic and flanking regions due to destabilization of the histone deacetylase complex. Consistent with this, transcriptional noise increases, as manifest by activation of repetitive elements and off-target genes. Interestingly, upSET mutant flies are female sterile due to upregulation of key components of Notch signaling during oogenesis. Thus UpSET defines a class of metazoan transcriptional regulators required to fine tune transcription by preventing the spread of active chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2004354005,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer (AD) and Parkinson (PD) are characterized by abnormal aggregation of misfolded β-sheet-rich proteins, including amyloid-β (Aβ)-derived peptides and tau in AD and α-synuclein in PD. Correct folding and assembly of these proteins are controlled by ubiquitously expressed molecular chaperones; however, our understanding of neuron-specific chaperones and their involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is limited. We here describe novel chaperone-like functions for the secretory protein 7B2, which is widely expressed in neuronal and endocrine tissues. In in vitro experiments, 7B2 efficiently prevented fibrillation and formation of Aβ(1-42), Aβ(1-40), and α-synuclein aggregates at a molar ratio of 1:10. In cell culture experiments, inclusion of recombinant 7B2, either in the medium of Neuro-2A cells or intracellularly via adenoviral 7B2 overexpression, blocked the neurocytotoxic effect of Aβ(1-42) and significantly increased cell viability. Conversely, knockdown of 7B2 by RNAi increased Aβ(1-42)-induced cytotoxicity. In the brains of APP/PSEN1 mice, a model of AD amyloidosis, immunoreactive 7B2 co-localized with aggregation-prone proteins and their respective aggregates. Furthermore, in the hippocampus and substantia nigra of human AD- and PD-affected brains, 7B2 was highly co-localized with Aβ plaques and α-synuclein deposits, strongly suggesting physiological association. Our data provide insight into novel functions of 7B2 and establish this neural protein as an anti-aggregation chaperone associated with neurodegenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W1972933336,"The topology of most experimentally determined protein domains is defined by the relative arrangement of secondary structure elements, i.e. α-helices and β-strands, which make up 50-70% of the sequence. Pairing of β-strands defines the topology of β-sheets. The packing of side chains between α-helices and β-sheets defines the majority of the protein core. Often, limited experimental datasets restrain the position of secondary structure elements while lacking detail with respect to loop or side chain conformation. At the same time the regular structure and reduced flexibility of secondary structure elements make these interactions more predictable when compared to flexible loops and side chains. To determine the topology of the protein in such settings, we introduce a tailored knowledge-based energy function that evaluates arrangement of secondary structure elements only. Based on the amino acid C(β) atom coordinates within secondary structure elements, potentials for amino acid pair distance, amino acid environment, secondary structure element packing, β-strand pairing, loop length, radius of gyration, contact order and secondary structure prediction agreement are defined. Separate penalty functions exclude conformations with clashes between amino acids or secondary structure elements and loops that cannot be closed. Each individual term discriminates for native-like protein structures. The composite potential significantly enriches for native-like models in three different databases of 10,000-12,000 protein models in 80-94% of the cases.

It optimizes a knowledge-based potential that analyzes radius of gyration, β-strand pairing, secondary structure element (SSE) packing, amino acid pair distance, amino acid environment, contact order, secondary structure prediction agreement and loop closure. Discontinuation of the protein chain favors sampling of non-local contacts and thereby creation of complex protein topologies. The folding simulation is accelerated through exclusion of flexible loop regions further reducing the size of the conformational search space. The algorithm is benchmarked on 66 proteins with lengths between 83 and 293 amino acids. For 61 out of these proteins, the best SSE-only models obtained have an RMSD100 below 8.0 Å and recover more than 20% of the native contacts. The algorithm assembles protein topologies with up to 215 residues and a relative contact order of 0.46. The method is tailored to be used in conjunction with low-resolution or sparse experimental data sets which often provide restraints for regions of defined secondary structure."
https://openalex.org/W2098067550,"Background In the MACRO study, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) were randomised to first-line treatment with 6 cycles of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX) plus bevacizumab followed by either single-agent bevacizumab or XELOX plus bevacizumab until disease progression. An additional retrospective analysis was performed to define the prognostic value of tumour KRAS status on progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and response rates. Methodology/Principal Findings KRAS data (tumour KRAS status and type of mutation) were collected by questionnaire from participating centres that performed KRAS analyses. These data were then cross-referenced with efficacy data for relevant patients in the MACRO study database. KRAS status was analysed in 394 of the 480 patients (82.1%) in the MACRO study. Wild-type (WT) KRAS tumours were found in 219 patients (56%) and mutant (MT) KRAS in 175 patients (44%). Median PFS was 10.9 months for patients with WT KRAS and 9.4 months for patients with MT KRAS tumours (p = 0.0038; HR: 1.40; 95% CI:1.12–1.77). The difference in OS was also significant: 26.7 months versus 18.0 months for WT versus MT KRAS, respectively (p = 0.0002; HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.23–1.96). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that KRAS was an independent variable for both PFS and OS. Responses were observed in 126 patients (57.5%) with WT KRAS tumours and 76 patients (43.4%) with MT KRAS tumours (p = 0.0054; OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.18–2.64). Conclusions/Significance This analysis of the MACRO study suggests a prognostic role for tumour KRAS status in patients with mCRC treated with XELOX plus bevacizumab. For both PFS and OS, KRAS status was an independent factor in univariate and multivariate analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2046221226,"Background The regulatory role of small RNAs (sRNAs) in various biological processes is an active area of investigation; however, there has been limited information available on the role of sRNAs in plant-insect interactions. This study was designed to identify sRNAs in cotton-melon aphid (Aphis gossypii) during the Vat-mediated resistance interaction with melon (Cucumis melo). Methodology/Principal Findings The role of miRNAs was investigated in response to aphid herbivory, during both resistant and susceptible interactions. sRNA libraries made from A. gossypii tissues feeding on Vat+ and Vat− plants revealed an unexpected abundance of 27 nt long sRNA sequences in the aphids feeding on Vat+ plants. Eighty-one conserved microRNAs (miRNAs), twelve aphid-specific miRNAs, and nine novel candidate miRNAs were also identified. Plant miRNAs found in the aphid libraries were most likely ingested during phloem feeding. The presence of novel miRNAs was verified by qPCR experiments in both resistant Vat+ and susceptible Vat− interactions. The comparative analyses revealed that novel miRNAs were differentially regulated during the resistant and susceptible interactions. Gene targets predicted for the miRNAs identified in this study by in silico analyses revealed their involvement in morphogenesis and anatomical structure determination, signal transduction pathways, cell differentiation and catabolic processes. Conclusion/Significance In this study, conserved and novel miRNAs were reported in A. gossypii. Deep sequencing data showed differences in the abundance of miRNAs and piRNA-like sequences in A. gossypii. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that A. gossypii miRNAs were differentially regulated during resistant and susceptible interactions. Aphids can also ingest plant miRNAs during phloem feeding that are stable in the insect."
https://openalex.org/W1987113557,"While ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) critically contributes to skeletal muscle contraction abilities by mediating Ca²⁺ion oscillation between sarcoplasmatic and myofibrillar compartments, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) senses contraction-induced energetic stress by phosphorylation at Thr¹⁷². Phosphorylation of RyR1 at serine²⁸⁴³ (pRyR1Ser²⁸⁴³) results in leaky RyR1 channels and impaired Ca²⁺homeostasis. Because acute resistance exercise exerts decreased contraction performance in skeletal muscle, preceded by high rates of Ca²⁺-oscillation and energetic stress, intense myofiber contractions may induce increased RyR1 and AMPK phosphorylation. However, no data are available regarding the time-course and magnitude of early RyR1 and AMPK phosphorylation in human myofibers in response to acute resistance exercise.Determine the effects and early time-course of resistance exercise on pRyR1Ser²⁸⁴³ and pAMPKThr¹⁷² in type I and II myofibers.7 male subjects (age 23±2 years, height: 185±7 cm, weight: 82±5 kg) performed 3 sets of 8 repetitions of maximum eccentric knee extensions. Muscle biopsies were taken at rest, 15, 30 and 60 min post exercise. pRyR1Ser²⁸⁴³ and pAMPKThr¹⁷² levels were determined by western blot and semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry techniques.While total RyR1 and total AMPK levels remained unchanged, RyR1 was significantly more abundant in type II than type I myofibers. pRyR1Ser²⁸⁴³ increased 15 min and peaked 30 min (p<0.01) post exercise in both myofiber types. Type I fibers showed relatively higher increases in pRyR1Ser²⁸⁴³ levels than type II myofibers and remained elevated up to 60 min post resistance exercise (p<0.05). pAMPKThr¹⁷² also increased 15 to 30 min post exercise (p<0.01) in type I and II myofibers and in whole skeletal muscle.Resistance exercise induces acutely increased pRyR1Ser²⁸⁴³ and concomitantly pAMPKThr¹⁷² levels for up to 30 min in resistance exercised myofibers. This provides a time-course by which pRyR1Ser²⁸⁴³ can mechanistically impact Ca²⁺handling properties and consequently induce reduced myofiber contractility beyond immediate fatiguing mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2000867577,"Neuronal Per Arnt Sim domain protein 4 (NPAS4), a brain-specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, has recently been shown to regulate the development of the GABAergic inhibitory synapses and transcription program for contextual memory formation in the hippocampus. We previously reported that chronic social isolation or restriction stress in mice resulted in an impairment in memory and emotional behavior, which was associated with a decrease in Npas4 mRNA levels. In this study, we investigated the role of NPAS4 in neuronal function in vitro and in vivo. Differentiation medium-induced neurite outgrowth was inhibited in Npas4 knockdown Neuro2a cells, whereas overexpression of NPAS4 accelerated the neurite outgrowth in Neuro2a cells. Furthermore, depolarization-induced neurite outgrowth was abolished in Npas4 KO hippocampal neurons. NPAS4 overexpression increased cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5)-dependent synapsin I phosphorylation in Neuro2a cells and primary cultured hippocampal neurons. A CDK5 inhibitor, roscovitine, inhibited the neurite outgrowth and the increase in phosphorylated synapsin I (p-SYN I) levels in Npas4-overexpressed Neuro2a cells. Interaction of NPAS4 with promoters of Cdk5 and NeuN genes was demonstrated by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In an in vivo study, pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions in mice resulted in an increase in NPAS4 and p-SYN I levels in the prefrontal cortex of wild-type mice, although no changes in p-SYN I levels were observed in Npas4 knock-out mice. These results suggest that NPAS4 plays an important role in the structural and functional plasticity of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1986987291,"Prostate cancer growth and progression depend on androgen receptor (AR) signaling through transcriptional mechanisms that require interactions with coregulatory proteins, one of which is the primate-specific steroid receptor coregulator melanoma antigen-A11 (MAGE-A11). In this report, we provide evidence how increased expression of MAGE-A11 during prostate cancer progression enhances AR signaling and prostate cancer growth. MAGE-A11 protein levels were highest in castration-recurrent prostate cancer. The cyclic AMP-induced increase in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent AR transcriptional activity correlated with an increase in MAGE-A11 and was inhibited by silencing MAGE-A11 expression. MAGE-A11 mediated synergistic AR transcriptional activity in LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells. The ability of MAGE-A11 to rescue transcriptional activity of complementary inactive AR mutants and promote coimmunoprecipitation between unlike forms of AR suggests that MAGE-A11 links transcriptionally active AR dimers. A model for the AR·MAGE-A11 multidimeric complex is proposed in which one AR FXXLF motif of the AR dimer engages in the androgen-dependent AR NH(2)- and carboxyl-terminal interaction, whereas the second FXXLF motif region of the AR dimer interacts with dimeric MAGE-A11. The AR·MAGE-A11 multidimeric complex accounts for the dual functions of the AR FXXLF motif in the androgen-dependent AR NH(2)- and carboxyl-terminal interaction and binding MAGE-A11 and for synergy between reported AR splice variants and full-length AR. We conclude that the increased expression of MAGE-A11 in castration-recurrent prostate cancer, which is enhanced by cyclic AMP signaling, increases AR-dependent growth of prostate cancer by MAGE-A11 forming a molecular bridge between transcriptionally active AR dimers."
https://openalex.org/W2146883463,"We compared gene expression signatures of aggressive amelanotic (Amela) melanomas with those of slowly growing pigmented melanomas (Mela), identifying pathways potentially responsible for the aggressive Amela phenotype. Both tumors develop in mice upon conditional deletion in melanocytes of Ink4a/Arf tumor suppressor genes with concomitant expression of oncogene H-RasG12V and a known tumor antigen. We previously showed that only the aggressive Amela tumors were highly infiltrated by leukocytes concomitant with local and systemic inflammation. We report that Amela tumors present a pattern of de-differentiation with reduced expression of genes involved in pigmentation. This correlates with reduced and enhanced expression, respectively, of microphthalmia-associated (Mitf) and Pou3f2/Brn-2 transcription factors. The reduced expression of Mitf-controlled melanocyte differentiation antigens also observed in some human cutaneous melanoma has important implications for immunotherapy protocols that generally target such antigens. Induced Amela tumors also express Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT)-like and TGFβ-pathway signatures. These are correlated with constitutive Smad3 signaling in Amela tumors and melanoma cell lines. Signatures of infiltrating leukocytes and some chemokines such as chemotactic cytokine ligand 2 (Ccl2) that contribute to leukocyte recruitment further characterize Amela tumors. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation pathway in Amela tumor lines leads to reduced expression of EMT hallmark genes and inhibits both proinflammatory cytokine Ccl2 gene expression and Ccl2 production by the melanoma cells. These results indicate a link between EMT-like processes and alterations of immune functions, both being controlled by the MAPK pathway. They further suggest that targeting the MAPK pathway within tumor cells will impact tumor-intrinsic oncogenic properties as well as the nature of the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W1975995722,"In the 1940s, the first generation of modern computers used vacuum tube oscillators as their principle components, however, with the development of the transistor, such oscillator based computers quickly became obsolete. As the demand for faster and lower power computers continues, transistors are themselves approaching their theoretical limit and emerging technologies must eventually supersede them. With the development of optical oscillators and Josephson junction technology, we are again presented with the possibility of using oscillators as the basic components of computers, and it is possible that the next generation of computers will be composed almost entirely of oscillatory devices. Here, we demonstrate how coupled threshold oscillators may be used to perform binary logic in a manner entirely consistent with modern computer architectures. We describe a variety of computational circuitry and demonstrate working oscillator models of both computation and memory."
https://openalex.org/W2170438286,"Mutable collagenous tissues (MCTs) of echinoderms show reversible changes in tensile properties (mutability) that are initiated and modulated by the nervous system via the activities of cells known as juxtaligamental cells. The molecular mechanism underpinning this mechanical adaptability has still to be elucidated. Adaptable connective tissues are also present in mammals, most notably in the uterine cervix, in which changes in stiffness result partly from changes in the balance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). There have been no attempts to assess the potential involvement of MMPs in the echinoderm mutability phenomenon, apart from studies dealing with a process whose relationship to the latter is uncertain. In this investigation we used the compass depressor ligaments (CDLs) of the sea-urchin Paracentrotus lividus. The effect of a synthetic MMP inhibitor - galardin - on the biomechanical properties of CDLs in different mechanical states (""standard"", ""compliant"" and ""stiff"") was evaluated by dynamic mechanical analysis, and the presence of MMPs in normal and galardin-treated CDLs was determined semi-quantitatively by gelatin zymography. Galardin reversibly increased the stiffness and storage modulus of CDLs in all three states, although its effect was significantly lower in stiff than in standard or compliant CDLs. Gelatin zymography revealed a progressive increase in total gelatinolytic activity between the compliant, standard and stiff states, which was possibly due primarily to higher molecular weight components resulting from the inhibition and degradation of MMPs. Galardin caused no change in the gelatinolytic activity of stiff CDLs, a pronounced and statistically significant reduction in that of standard CDLs, and a pronounced, but not statistically significant, reduction in that of compliant CDLs. Our results provide evidence that MMPs may contribute to the variable tensility of the CDLs, in the light of which we provide an updated hypothesis for the regulatory mechanism controlling MCT mutability."
https://openalex.org/W2050179252,"Background/Objective The CDKAL1 gene is among the best-replicated susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes, originally identified by genome-wide association studies in humans. To clarify a physiological importance of CDKAL1, we examined effects of a global Cdkal1-null mutation in mice and also evaluated the influence of a CDKAL1 risk allele on body mass index (BMI) in Japanese subjects. Methods In Cdkal1-deficient (Cdkal1−/−) mice, we performed oral glucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance test, and perfusion experiments with and without high-fat feeding. Based on the findings in mice, we tested genetic association of CDKAL1 variants with BMI, as a measure of adiposity, and type 2 diabetes in Japanese. Principal Findings On a standard diet, Cdkal1−/− mice were modestly lighter in weight than wild-type littermates without major alterations in glucose metabolism. On a high fat diet, Cdkal1−/− mice showed significant reduction in fat accumulation (17% reduction in %intraabdominal fat, P = 0.023 vs. wild-type littermates) with less impaired insulin sensitivity at an early stage. High fat feeding did not potentiate insulin secretion in Cdkal1−/− mice (1.0-fold), contrary to the results in wild-type littermates (1.6-fold, P<0.01). Inversely, at a later stage, Cdkal1−/− mice showed more prominent impairment of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. mRNA expression analysis indicated that Scd1 might function as a critical mediator of the altered metabolism in Cdkal1−/− mice. In accordance with the findings in mice, a nominally significant (P<0.05) association between CDKAL1 rs4712523 and BMI was replicated in 2 Japanese general populations comprising 5,695 and 12,569 samples; the risk allele for type 2 diabetes was also associated with decreased BMI. Conclusions Cdkal1 gene deletion is accompanied by modestly impaired insulin secretion and longitudinal fluctuations in insulin sensitivity during high-fat feeding in mice. CDKAL1 may affect such compensatory mechanisms regulating glucose homeostasis through interaction with diet."
https://openalex.org/W2013505538,"Chondroadherin, a leucine-rich repeat family member, contains a very C-terminal sequence CKFPTKRSKKAGRH(359), now shown to bind to heparin with a K(D) of 13 μm. This observation led us to investigate whether chondroadherin interacts via this C-terminal heparin-binding domain with glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans at the cell surface. Cells were shown to bind this heparin-binding peptide in FACS analysis, and the interaction was shown to be with glycosaminoglycans because it was abolished when sulfation was inhibited by chlorate treatment of the cells. In separate experiments, heparin and heparan sulfate inhibited the peptide interaction in a dose-dependent manner. Using a human chondrosarcoma and a murine osteoblast cell line, heparan sulfate proteoglycans were identified as the cell surface receptors involved in the binding. Different binding syndecans were identified in the two different cell lines, indicating that the same protein core of a proteoglycan may have structural and functional differences in the attached heparan sulfate chains. Upon binding to coated peptide, cells spread, demonstrating engagement of the cytoskeleton, but no focal adhesion complex was formed. The number of cells adhering via their β(1) integrin receptor to collagen type II or chondroadherin was profoundly and rapidly enhanced by the addition of the heparin-binding peptide. The peptide added to the cells caused ERK phosphorylation, showing that it triggered intracellular signaling. The results show that heparan sulfate chains differ between various members of the proteoglycan families on a given cell, but also differ between the same proteoglycan on different cells with a potential for differential regulation of cellular activities."
https://openalex.org/W1966684276,"Disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow may exist in a dormant state for extended periods of time, maintaining the ability to proliferate upon activation, engraft at new sites, and form detectable metastases. However, understanding of the behavior and biology of dormant breast cancer cells in the bone marrow niche remains limited, as well as their potential involvement in tumor recurrence and metastasis. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of dormant disseminated breast cancer cells (prior to activation) in the bone marrow.Total bone marrow, isolated from mice previously injected with tumorspheres into the mammary fat pad, was injected into the mammary fat pad of NUDE mice. As a negative control, bone marrow isolated from non-injected mice was injected into the mammary fat pad of NUDE mice. The resultant tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Mouse lungs, livers, and kidneys were analyzed by H+E staining to detect metastases. The injection of bone marrow isolated from mice previously injected with tumorspheres into the mammary fat pad, resulted in large tumor formation in the mammary fat pad 2 months post-injection. However, the injection of bone marrow isolated from non-injected mice did not result in tumor formation in the mammary fat pad. The DTC-derived tumors exhibited accelerated development of metastatic lesions within the lung, liver and kidney. The resultant tumors and the majority of metastatic lesions within the lung and liver exhibited a mesenchymal-like phenotype.Dormant DTCs within the bone marrow are highly malignant upon injection into the mammary fat pad, with the accelerated development of metastatic lesions within the lung, liver and kidney. These results suggest the acquisition of a more aggressive phenotype of DTCs during metastatic latency within the bone marrow microenvironment."

In an effort to identify mechanisms that regulate MLK3 activity in β cells, we discovered that IL-1β stimulates Lys-63-linked ubiquitination of MLK3 via a conserved, TRAF6-binding peptapeptide motif in the catalytic domain of the kinase. TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination was required for dissociation of inactive monomeric MLK3 from the scaffold protein IB1/JIP1, facilitating the subsequent dimerization, autophosphorylation, and catalytic activation of MLK3. Inability to ubiquitinate MLK3, or the presence of A20, an upstream Lys-63-linked deubiquitinase, strongly curtailed the ability of MLK3 to affect the proapoptotic translocation of BAX in cytokine-stimulated pancreatic β cells, an early step in the progression toward β cell death.

https://openalex.org/W2015532779,"Whereas brief acute or intermittent episodes of hypoxia have been shown to exert a protective role in the central nervous system and to stimulate neurogenesis, other studies suggest that early hypoxia may constitute a risk factor that influences the future development of mental disorders. We therefore investigated the effects of a neonatal “conditioning-like” hypoxia (100% N2, 5 min) on the brain and the cognitive outcomes of rats until 720 days of age (physiologic senescence). We confirmed that such a short hypoxia led to brain neurogenesis within the ensuing weeks, along with reduced apoptosis in the hippocampus involving activation of Erk1/2 and repression of p38 and death-associated protein (DAP) kinase. At 21 days of age, increased thicknesses and cell densities were recorded in various subregions, with strong synapsin activation. During aging, previous exposure to neonatal hypoxia was associated with enhanced memory retrieval scores specifically in males, better preservation of their brain integrity than controls, reduced age-related apoptosis, larger hippocampal cell layers, and higher expression of glutamatergic and GABAergic markers. These changes were accompanied with a marked expression of synapsin proteins, mainly of their phosphorylated active forms which constitute major players of synapse function and plasticity, and with increases of their key regulators, i.e. Erk1/2, the transcription factor EGR-1/Zif-268 and Src kinase. Moreover, the significantly higher interactions between PSD-95 scaffolding protein and NMDA receptors measured in the hippocampus of 720-day-old male animals strengthen the conclusion of increased synaptic functional activity and plasticity associated with neonatal hypoxia. Thus, early non-injurious hypoxia may trigger beneficial long term effects conferring higher resistance to senescence in aged male rats, with a better preservation of cognitive functions."
https://openalex.org/W1978337367,"Background Although some molecules have been identified as responsible for human language disorders, there is still little information about what molecular mechanisms establish the faculty of human language. Since mice, like songbirds, produce complex ultrasonic vocalizations for intraspecific communication in several social contexts, they can be good mammalian models for studying the molecular basis of human language. Having found that cadherins are involved in the vocal development of the Bengalese finch, a songbird, we expected cadherins to also be involved in mouse vocalizations. Methodology/Principal Findings To examine whether similar molecular mechanisms underlie the vocalizations of songbirds and mammals, we categorized behavioral deficits including vocalization in cadherin-6 knockout mice. Comparing the ultrasonic vocalizations of cadherin-6 knockout mice with those of wild-type controls, we found that the peak frequency and variations of syllables were differed between the mutant and wild–type mice in both pup-isolation and adult-courtship contexts. Vocalizations during male-male aggression behavior, in contrast, did not differ between mutant and wild–type mice. Open-field tests revealed differences in locomotors activity in both heterozygote and homozygote animals and no difference in anxiety behavior. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that cadherin-6 plays essential roles in locomotor activity and ultrasonic vocalization. These findings also support the idea that different species share some of the molecular mechanisms underlying vocal behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2053862600,"Arabidopsis AtGH9C1 is an endo-β-1,4-glucanase possessing a carbohydrate-binding domain (CBM49). Analysis of AtGH9C1 expression by promoter-reporter GUS, RT-PCR, public transcriptome databases and GFP protein tagging demonstrated a high and selective expression of AtGH9C1 in root hairs and in the endosperm. Expression in root hair cells started prior to bulge formation and continued during hair elongation. AtGH9C1 expression increased with treatments that increase density (ACC) or length (sucrose) of root hairs. Expression in the endosperm extended sequentially to the micropylar, peripheral and chalazal compartments. A mutant with reduced AtGH9C1 expression had a delay in germination and a marked reduction in root hair presence. Complementation of the mutant partially improved both germination and root hair density. Experiments with ectopically expressed AtGH9C1-GFP with and without the CBM49, demonstrated that both forms of the protein are secreted and that CBM49 targets the protein to specific regions of the cell wall, but what makes these regions special is still unknown. The amino acid alignment of angiosperm GH9 genes with C-terminal extensions illustrate that AtGH9C1 belongs to a different clade than its tomato homolog, S1GH9C1. The latter has a CBM49 that was shown to bind crystalline cellulose. We suggest that AtGH9C1 is associated with the weakening of the cell wall during formation and growth of the root hair as well as with the sequential anterior-posterior breakdown of the endosperm cell wall that provides space for the growing embryo. Thus, is likely that the CBM49 of AtGH9C1 recognizes a form of cellulose or glucan polymer that is prevalent in the wall of these specialized tissues and that is different than the one recognized by S1GH9C1."
https://openalex.org/W2038429755,"Cationic cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) and their lipid domain-conjugates (CatLip) are agents for the delivery of (uncharged) biologically active molecules into the cell. Using infection and transfection assays we surprisingly discovered that CatLip peptides were able to inhibit replication of Duck Hepatitis B Virus (DHBV), a reference model for human HBV. Amongst twelve CatLip peptides we identified Deca-(Arg)₈ having a particularly potent antiviral activity, leading to a drastic inhibition of viral particle secretion without detectable toxicity. Inhibition of virion secretion was correlated with a dose-dependent increase in intracellular viral DNA. Deca-(Arg)₈ peptide did neither interfere with DHBV entry, nor with formation of mature nucleocapsids nor with their travelling to the nucleus. Instead, Deca-(Arg)₈ caused envelope protein accumulation in large clusters as revealed by confocal laser scanning microscopy indicating severe structural changes of preS/S. Sucrose gradient analysis of supernatants from Deca-(Arg)₈-treated cells showed unaffected naked viral nucleocapsids release, which was concomitant with a complete arrest of virion and surface protein-containing subviral particle secretion. This is the first report showing that a CPP is able to drastically block hepadnaviral release from infected cells by altering late stages of viral morphogenesis via interference with enveloped particle formation, without affecting naked nucleocapsid egress, thus giving a view inside the mode of inhibition. Deca-(Arg)₈ may be a useful tool for elucidating the hepadnaviral secretory pathway, which is not yet fully understood. Moreover we provide the first evidence that a modified CPP displays a novel antiviral mechanism targeting another step of viral life cycle compared to what has been so far described for other enveloped viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2064950531,"Gravitation field algorithm (GFA) is a new optimization algorithm which is based on an imitation of natural phenomena. GFA can do well both for searching global minimum and multi-minima in computational biology. But GFA needs to be improved for increasing efficiency, and modified for applying to some discrete data problems in system biology.An improved GFA called IGFA was proposed in this paper. Two parts were improved in IGFA. The first one is the rule of random division, which is a reasonable strategy and makes running time shorter. The other one is rotation factor, which can improve the accuracy of IGFA. And to apply IGFA to the hierarchical clustering, the initial part and the movement operator were modified.Two kinds of experiments were used to test IGFA. And IGFA was applied to hierarchical clustering. The global minimum experiment was used with IGFA, GFA, GA (genetic algorithm) and SA (simulated annealing). Multi-minima experiment was used with IGFA and GFA. The two experiments results were compared with each other and proved the efficiency of IGFA. IGFA is better than GFA both in accuracy and running time. For the hierarchical clustering, IGFA is used to optimize the smallest distance of genes pairs, and the results were compared with GA and SA, singular-linkage clustering, UPGMA. The efficiency of IGFA is proved."
https://openalex.org/W2110561151,"The objective of this work is to investigate the relationship between endo-β-mannanase and leaf abscission, and response to wounding in soybean (Glycine max). An endo-β-mannanase gene GmMAN1 was cloned from the abscission zone in petiole explants, and was heterologously expressed in E. coli. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the fusion protein. The increases in activity, isoform numbers, and amounts of transcripts and proteins of GmMAN1 were found not only in the abscission zone but also in the non-abscission zone during petiole abscission in the explants, but not in these two tissues during leaf abscission artificially induced by ethephon treatment in the intact plants. The changes in endo-β-mannanase expression patterns in these two tissues were probably induced by the inherent mechanical wounding during the preparation of explants. When soybean plants were wounded by removing half of the leaf blade of the first pair of true leaves, the transcripts and proteins of GmMAN1 were induced in the leaves and stem, leading to the increases in enzyme activity and isoform numbers in them. It is concluded that the soybean endo-β-mannanase GmMAN1 is not associated with leaf abscission, but might be involved in the response to wounding."

It was estimated that (1) The impact of HIV on teacher supply is sufficient to derail efforts to achieve EFA in several countries and universal access can mitigate this. (2) In SSA, the 2008 costs to education of HIV were about half of those estimated in 2002. Providing universal access for teachers in SSA is cost-effective on education returns alone and provides a return of $3.99 on the dollar. (3) The impacts on education in the hyperendemic countries in Southern Africa will continue to increase to 2015 from its 2008 level, already the highest in the world. (4) If treatment roll-out is successful, numbers of HIV positive teachers are set to increase in all the regions studied.The return on investing in care and support is also greater in those areas with highest impact. SSA requires increased investment in teacher support, testing and particularly ART if it is to achieve EFA. The situation for teachers in the Caribbean and East Asia is similar but on a smaller scale proportionate to the lower levels of infection and greater existing access to care and support."
https://openalex.org/W2129307793,"The Cheiruridae are a diverse group of trilobites and several subfamilies within the clade have been the focus of recent phylogenetic studies. This paper focuses on the relationships of one of those subfamilies, the Ordovician Eccoptochilinae. We analyze sixteen species from six genera within the traditionally defined group, using the pilekiid Anacheirurus frederici as an outgroup. To assess the monophyly of the Eccoptochilinae seven sphaerexochine species, Kawina arnoldi, Sphaerexochus arenosus, S. atacius, S. latifrons, S. mirus, S. parvus, and S. scabridus were included in the analysis as well. The results of this analysis show that the genus Eccoptochile represents a paraphyletic grade and species traditionally assigned to Parasphaerexochus and Skelipyx plot within Pseudosphaerexochus. Also, representative species of Sphaerexochinae plot within the traditionally defined Eccoptochilinae, suggesting Eccoptochilinae itself is paraphyletic. To resolve this, we propose all species of Pseudosphaerexochus be placed within Sphaerexochinae and Eccoptochilinae be restricted to a monotypic Eccoptochile clavigera."
https://openalex.org/W1983580455,"Background & Aims A combination of pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin (PR) is the standard therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis C. The impact of polymorphism of interleukin-28B (IL28B) on sustained virological response (SVR) to PR has been well documented in patients with CHC genotype-1 (GT1), but it is controversial in genotype-2 (GT2) CHC patients. This study investigated the predictability of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of IL28B on the treatment responses of PR in patients with CHC GT2. Method 197 CHC GT2 consecutive patients who received PR treatment in our prospective cohort were enrolled. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotyping, quantification of HCV-RNA and genotyping of the ten SNPs of IL28B were performed. Six SNPs of IL28B were chosen for analysis. The propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was applied using patients with CHC GT1 in another prospective cohort as a positive comparison to avoid covariate bias. Results The distribution of the six SNPs was similar in GT1 and GT2 patients. Five of these SNPs had strong association with treatment responses in GT1 but not in GT2 patients. After PSM analysis, these five SNPs still showed strong association with rapid virological response (RVR), cEVR and SVR in GT1 and had no influence in GT2 patients. Furthermore, rs12979860 and baseline viral load were the predictors for both RVR and SVR in GT1 patients. However, only baseline viral load could predict RVR and SVR in GT2 patients. In addition, in patients without RVR, rs12979860 was the only predictor for SVR in GT1 but no predictor for SVR was found in GT2. Conclusions The genetic polymorphisms of IL28B had no impact on treatment responses in GT2 patients."
https://openalex.org/W2139977536,"We must frequently adapt our movements in order to successfully perform motor tasks. These visuomotor adaptations can occur with or without our awareness and so, have generally been described by two mechanisms: strategic control and spatial realignment. Strategic control is a conscious modification used when discordance between an intended and actual movement is observed. Spatial realignment is an unconscious recalibration in response to subtle differences between an intended and efferent movement. Traditional methods of investigating visuomotor adaptation often involve simplistic, repetitive motor goals and so may be vulnerable to subject boredom or expectation. Our laboratory has recently developed a novel, engaging computer-based task, the Viewing Window, to investigate visuomotor adaptation to large, apparent distortions. Here, we contrast behavioural measures of visuomotor adaptation during the Viewing Window task when either gradual progressive rotations or large, sudden rotations are introduced in order to demonstrate that this paradigm can be utilized to investigate both strategic control and spatial realignment. The gradual rotation group demonstrated significantly faster mean velocities and spent significantly less time off the object compared to the sudden rotation group. These differences demonstrate adaptation to the distortion using spatial realignment. Scan paths revealed greater after-effects in the gradual rotation group reflected by greater time spent scanning areas off of the object. These results demonstrate the ability to investigate both strategic control and spatial realignment. Thus, the Viewing Window provides a powerful engaging tool for investigating the neural basis of visuomotor adaptation and impairment following injury and disease."
