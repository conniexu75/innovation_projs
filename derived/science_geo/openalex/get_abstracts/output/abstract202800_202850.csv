https://openalex.org/W2022106712,"Marked polydipsia was produced in all animals trained to press a bar for food pellets on a 1-minute variable-interval schedule. It is suggested that since this feeding arrangement produces a sustained, high fluid intake in the normal, unrestrained animal, it might serve as a useful tool in the study of renal function."

https://openalex.org/W2074469885,"Retinal receptor wave-guide modal patterns have been photographed. The inner and outer segments of the rod and cone receptors of albino rats, rhesus macaque monkeys, and human beings have been studied. The wave-guide modal pattern is believed to be the normal form of energy transfer in these parts of the retinal receptors in these species."

Sighting-dominance and acuity-dominance were associated. In addition, most individuals tested showed acuity-dominance of the left eye."

https://openalex.org/W1986197542,"Experiments with tick-paralyzed dogs and woodchucks have shown impairment of stretch reflexes in addition to partial paralysis at the neuromuscular junction. Stretch reflexes disappear very early during paralysis, whereas nociceptive reflexes do not appear to be directly affected. The early incoordination and the ascending nature of the paralysis may be related to impairment of stretch reflex pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1998000873,"TWENTY-TWO tryptophans have been examined in order to check the specificity of the so-called 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase1,2, and at the same time to see whether any of these compounds could be decarboxylated at a rate similar to that known for 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). The present work was intended as preliminary to further investigations on the possibility of non-biogenic tryptophans interfering in the biosynthesis, actions and metabolism of endogenous 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), especially of brain 5-HT."

https://openalex.org/W2170118195,A chemoreceptor neuron of the adult blowfly contains several different sites for activation by sugars. It appears that the number or affinity of the sites for fructose and perhaps those for glucose may be depressed by rearing the larvae in the presence of the sugar in question.
https://openalex.org/W2063293331,"OUCHTERLONY'S technique of agar diffusion1 has made it possible to demonstrate the presence of certain viral antigens and antibodies not identifiable by other serological means. Datt and Orleans2, in 1958, found an antigenic substance common to vaccinia and pig pox; Taylor-Robinson and Rundle3 have demonstrated a common antigen in chicken pox and herpes zoster. These successes prompted a re-investigation of the antigenicity of molluscum contagiosum, a large virus that produces benign skin tumours in man."

https://openalex.org/W2047557900,An enzyme in extracts of Euglena gracilis splits both purine and pyrimidine internucleotide bonds of ribonucleic acid. Its pH optimum is at 4.5; it is very heat-labile and is rather insensitive to inhibition by metal ions or sulfhydryl group reagents. A partial purification of the enzyme is described.

https://openalex.org/W1980484166,DURING the investigation of human tissues for fibrinolytic activity the presence of a fibrinolytic substance was detected in a specimen of a spleen. This was a case of splenic mastocytosis previously reported1 in which there were many mast cells and a high concentration of histamine and heparin in the splenic tissue.

https://openalex.org/W1979975929,IN some respects the mouse is a desirable experimental animal for immunological studies. Because of its small size and high reproductivity it can be used in statistically meaningful numbers. Availability of highly inbred strains minimizes variation in individual response and makes it possible to select strains of maximal sensitivity1.
https://openalex.org/W1995323371,"In striking contrast to the seizure patterns of other animals, the electroshock seizure of the sloth consists of weak extension followed by tonic flexion and terminal clonus. A similar pattern is seen with direct spinal cord stimulation. Strychnine produces a pure flexor convulsion. In the spinal sloth, painful stimulation of one foot causes extension at some joints of that limb and strong flexion at all joints of the contralateral limb."

The data suggest that arginine exerts an inhibitory effect upon or represses the synthesis of an enzyme involved in pyrimidine formation."

https://openalex.org/W1526083849,"ASEN et al.
1 have recently added β-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIB) to the growing list of amino-acids found in higher plants by isolating this compound from the roots of Iris tingitana var. Wedgewood. Fink et al.
2,3 have shown that BAIB can arise metabolically from thymine via dihydrothymine and β-ureidoisobutyric acid in the rat. This discovery, taken in conjunction with our recent observation4 that the higher plant Brassica napus (rape) forms radioactive dihydrothymine, β-ureidoisobutyric acid and carbon dioxide from 2-14C-thymine, strongly suggested to us that, in iris, thymine might well be the source of BAIB. This possibility was tested by supplying totally tritiated thymine to tissue sections of Iris tingitana var. Wedgewood."

While most of the fruiting bodies produced by this organism are the result of selffertilization, conclusive evidence of cross-fertilization and recombination between two mutants was obtained. Cross-fertilization occurred rarely."
